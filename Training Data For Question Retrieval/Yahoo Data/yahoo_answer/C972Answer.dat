Enfin, le football d'entreprise runit l'ensemble des quipes de football cres au sein des entreprises, et qui runissent les salaris dsireux de jouer ensemble. Au trs haut niveau, la meilleur quipe est le Louis Nicollin Montpellier, mais il y a aussi le CETN Le Havre (Total), les pompiers de Paris ou le CHU Talence, parmi bien d'autres.

AA11266978	well maybe your a little light but your young and you can always hit the gym....and 100 yard in 11 seconds is damn good man........thats like 12 or 13 seconds in 100m....the world record is like 9.87 or something.....now either way my friend if you play football your gonna need that ability to take a hit because your definetly gonna get hurt.....its the name of the game    but to figure out what you wanna do then you have to ask yourself what you wanna really do.......do you wanna tackle ppl and make interceptions or do you wanna score and have glory    now the higher level of competition you get the more the coaches dont try you out in different positions and you have to pick yourself....i had to do that and didnt like it becasue i got cut lol....i probably had more talent at running back but i tried out for defensive back and wide receiver.....learn from my mistake.....dont worry about getting cut or force yourself to do a position you dont truly love.....do the position that you feel most comfotably in unless the coach says otherwise    now the different positons are:    quarterback: throws the ball and manages the offense....usually the team leader    running back is divided in two....fullback and half back...fullback usually really big and is the lead blocker for the half back who is usually the main runner of the team...the running game and also both running backs catch short passes    the receivers are the usually the fastest players who run routs and catch all sorts or passes    the tight end is usually a big guy who is half wide receiver half offensive lineman.....they sometimes help out and block but most of the time they catch intermediate distance passes in the middle of the field    now the offensive lineman and the defensive lineman are the biggest on the field.....offensive blocks the defensive lineman when their trying to rush the quarterback    the linebackers are in the middle of the defense and usually stop the run or cover receiver in short yard situations     and the defensive backs are divided in two....safeties are the last line of defense and stay back in coverage....the free safety covers the deep passes and the wide receivers and the strong safety stay closer to the linebackers for run support or cover the tight ends........of course there are exceptions and its not always like this..........and finally the cornerbacks cover the receiver directly and usually follow them everywhere on the field    i would suggest with your size and speed and you say your small that you play corner but i never liked it because you have to backpedal a lot and you have to be quick to react and not just fast because you dont know where the receivers going    safety might be too hard for you the first year because you have to know all the receivers routes and stuff more and know the passing tree    and if you wanna be on offense then you might wanna be a half back because you run and if your quick then you could be like the next barry sanders or you could shake the defenders easily    or you could be wide receiver because most of them are really tall but there are shorter receivers that are quick as hell but make it.....like joey galloway or steve smith.....but you have to be able to catch and run precise routes    final thouht get buff work out at the gym and find out what you love and what positon you would like but when working out at the gym dont lose any speed because speed is very useful and speed kills    good luck|`|20237491cfa973102521508693e9d1a5aa	well it does help if you kinda know what you wanna be. Usually the coaches ask what position you want to play and they divide you up accordingly. Its a good thing that you can take a hit, if you can run good and take a hit. Then i suggest goin for running back. You could also go out for reviever but you have to have good hands for that. On defense a safety definetly would be a good choice for you. Pretty much you have to be quick to get to recivers that dont get picked up by the other defense men. Your there for pass protection you have to be able to get to a reciver, keep up with them and either knock away the ball or intercept it. Which would be good for you cause you said you have some catching skills and can run fast. i would go for these but talk to your coach after a couple of practices and ask him how you are doing, and if he thinks there is a better position for you to play. The coach is there to help you along and to make the team come together as a unit. If he thinks there is a better postion for you to play, and he knows your open to suggestions then he should definetly be willing to help you out, but he has to know that you are open to suggestion on where to play, that make his job a lot easier.|`|cdba03006999193f51f060be4864d7fdaa	i don't know if you have to know before you try out but if i were you i'd play on offense and be a running back so you can run the ball down the field to gain yards and possibly even score. a safety [[i think]] plays on defense. they are the last line defense if the offense gets past everyone.|`|AA12224567	Wide Reciever or Wide out if you have scary speed.  Your whole job is to run fast and catch the ball.    If you don't have hands for catching become a corner back.  Great speed protects the endzone.    Leave the safty to the smaller guys.  That takes a cat like skill. Similiar to cornerback but you dart around allover trying to anticipate where the ball is going for tackles and passes.    Oh yeah you may play many different positions until you find a home. Most coaches figure it out and simply put you there.  Not all that much real choice involved. Coaches want a winning team. and so should you.|`|AA10356568	offensive: WR probably to small to play running back on any decent squad.      defense:  DB preferrably cornerback, but you can't be afraid to get regardless.

Avec lui, la Hongrie a t sacre championne olympique en 1952 et a atteint la finale de la Coupe du monde 1954, battue par l'Allemagne de l'Ouest.  Pour des millions de supporters en Hongrie, Puskas tait tout simplement "Ocsi" (NDLR: "petit frre" en hongrois) et faisait partie pour ainsi dire de leur famille.   Puskas avait t capitaine de "la meilleure quipe du monde", selon les mots de l'ancien footballeur anglais Billy Wright.   "De nous tous, il tait le meilleur", avait dclar lors de son 70e anniversaire en 1997 Nandor Hidegkuti, l'un de ses anciens quipiers.   "Il avait un septime sens pour le football. S'il y avait 1.000 solutions, il choisissait la 1001e."

Personnellement, je vois bien Buffon ou Cannavaro s'imposer avec une prfrence pour Buffon mme si Cannavaro est plus plebiscit.   Aucun but pris en mondial  part l'auto-goal et le but de Z. Zidane, une performance solide en Serie A et en Champion's league la saison dernire, exceptionnel en Serie B cette saison justifie son titre de meilleur gardien actuel et en fait un grand protagoniste.

222f4ab65c11f2459355997e8c097073aa	Personally i'm a mad Pro Evolution Soccer fan, I've stopped playing FIFA ever since 2001. I've got to say PE is a lot better and the game play is a lot neater and more realistic. The game engine is more enjoying and the goals you score are never the same. However, FIFA has enjoyed a fair share of all the licenses of the major sporting leagues in the Europe so instead of Merseysiders Red seen in PE, you get Liverpool in FIFA. PE6 is catching up with the licenses, in the PS2 series not sure bout 360, they capture Man Utd,Bayern Munich, England,Australia,Holland national team licenses and many more     In terms of graphics wise, FIFA might have the edge over PE but I don't own a 360 so I can't comment on it. If your a hardcore football fan go for PE6, if not just go for FIFA. PE6 is a very hard and challenging game and takes forever to master it.|`|cff68122db798e2bc53d325cabad757eaa	both are great!!

e8de2966baaeb88154b07130842a8179aa	I believe he is.  He has had an impressive career but he said last season he would be going.  I would like to state for the record too, to all the naysayers who answered this question, that Brett Favre is one of the best quarterbacks who has ever played the game and he has a genuine love of the game.  You don't see that with a lot of the money hungry players out there today. He has class, he has a killer arm STILL, and when he is ready to leave, it will be a sad day in the NFL.|`|167c271380646d94b70183479531c4d7aa	idk|`|AA10881326	probably .He is old and gets hurt like every 3 games|`|AA10742014	i think he might if he keeps getting injured|`|AA12364376	I HOPE SO!|`|73f0e127c6cd9ea279379c9428a10395aa	I think so. Green Bay isn't doing too well, and with a losing record this year, there's little-to-no chance they'll spring back into contender form next year. He's not padding an 'all-time' record, like Emmitt Smith did when he left Dallas for Arizona. So no shot at a winner and no 'all-time' record - the only reason he'd stay is because he just wants to, which I think is what he did this year.    I think odds are that he'll pack it in at the end of this season.

3ef9c5c79ad7fdf66283e08d526b491faa	Kiten ist eine Extremsportart deren Risiken sich verringern lassen, indem man in einer offiziellen Kite-Schule den korrekten Umgang lernt, Schutzkleidung tr?gt (Helm, Prallschutzweste), sich und die Kraft, die ein Kite entwickeln kann, nicht untersch?tzt, sich ber Wind- und Wetterverh?ltnisse informiert hat, sich ber die besonderen Revierverh?ltnisse (Str?mungen, Riffe, Sandb?nke usw.) informiert hat, Abstand zu anderen Strandg?sten h?lt, nicht alleine kiten geht, sondern einen Start-/Landepartner hat und auf dem Wasser beobachtet wird.    Kitesurfen kann sehr gef?hrlich werden, wenn der Surfer nicht richtig funktionierende Sicherheitssysteme benutzt und sich so nicht vom Schirm trennen kann, der Surfer Gefahr l?uft, ber Land oder sonstige Hindernisse in Lee geschleift zu werden, eine Boardleash benutzt wird (das Kiteboard wird nach Strzen ggf. in Richtung des Sportlers gerissen), das Material vor dem Start nicht auf Abnutzungserscheinungen berprft wurde und auf dem Wasser versagt.    Darberhinaus haben einige Unfallversicherungen das Kitesurfen in den Versicherungsbedingungen ausgeschlossen.     Es ist darberhinaus empfehlenswert, eine private Haftpflichtversicherung abzuschliessen, die Sch?den aus dieser Sportart gegenber Dritten reguliert.    Was mehr Spass macht, und was leichter zu erlernen ist, h?ngt von der Motivation und Geschicklichkeit Desjenigen ab. Deswegen wrde ich aus Grnden der Vergleichbarkeit - wenn m?glich - Probestunden nehmen.    Ich pers?nlich tendiere eher zum Windsurfen als Einstieg, da ich es fr leichter erlernbar halte.    Ich hoffe, mit der Antwort weitergeholfen zu haben.|`|7be1e1d6b50280211b4d02387d32aad9aa	Kitesurfen oder auch Kiteboarden ist aus dem Windsurfen entstanden, wobei man anstelle des Segels einen "Kite" (Lenkdrachen) fr die Fortbewegung verwendet.

I know some of you might say that his moves might be cut yatta-yatta-yatta. But Simply because he has that "Y2J" era in him. I also believe if Shelley is rightly pushed in WWE h will be a sure legend.

Que nos animemos a jugarles de igual a igual,  o que hayamos tenido selecciones que les hayan ganado, no significa que nos creamos mejores.  Pero, te voy a decir otra cosa que tal vez no hayas tenido en cuenta;  al margen de haber tenido jugadores muy habilidosos  o capaces como Maradona, Vern en su momento, Riquelme, tambin en su momento,  y hoy el chico Messi,  por nombrarte algunos, argentina se caracteriza por su juego colectivo y Brasil,  no tanto, sino que se afianza ms en sus individualidades, o lo hacen ellas mismas, por decirlo de alguna manera.  Y sino fijte lo que pas en el ltimo mundial; haba tantas "estrellas" en el equipo brasile?o que cada uno haca la suya y se fueron a casa temprano.  No se si se entendi; hay selecciones latinoamericanas que nunca le pudieron ganar a la argentina teniendo jugadores tanto o mas habilidosos; la diferencia, por lgica, estriba en el juego colectivo, porque eso caracteriza a un equipo de ftbol.  Y del mundial del 2002, no s,  argentina tena una seleccin que "meta miedo" para todos los especialistas, pero bueno,  tal vez un planteo inadecuado y  a casa. Brasil en cambio, en muchos partidos tuvo demasiada "suerte", aparte de una zona favorable.

However, many in the media project him to break it around the All-Star Break.    I think he's definitely proven himself worthy of breaking the record.  He's having one of his best years at the age of 42.  Babe Ruth couldn't hit over .200 at 40.  And of course, there is no way Barry's doing steroids.  They'd catch him too easily (have they caught anybody yet this year?).    I'm looking forward to seeing him hit 756, even though I think he will be a setting duck for A-Rod, who will probably take pass his single season record this year and finish his career around 1000 or so.  It is now clear that steroids weren't the answer to why there was so much offense.  There has been even more of it of late.|`|76089115a265861ab1277351d77833f8aa	Barry Bonds doesnt deserve to break the record. he is a drug-head and no1 likes him.|`|s26ipCU8aa	A date in baseball hell.|`|Pilezbpbaa	may be   may29-31 or earler|`|143fc6d1bd6df9d266c7a48eed06da0caa	baseball sucksss big ffuccking balls..GO SOCCER!!!!.....

Can you replace Guerrero? I wouldn't do this trade.|`|rvvLDUp4aa	Remember AROD just got injured. He should be fine, but you never know how well he will play after an injury.

A-Rod is not worth giving up Guillen and Guerrerro.|`|87826378f29595e6b5b7bf66af6c52d3aa	I like this trade for you, if you are on Yahoo or a league where Hall has SS eligability, I think you take this, providing Perez is an upgrade for your pitching, and you would use him    Lowell's fantasy season is getting close to over, I love the guy, but he is a first half player, that is a fact, he knows it, He will contribute some RBi's in the second half, but the BA will drop, he never has had a really high OBP, so don't expect a lot of Runs scored. Vlad and Carlos are good players, but A-rod is the best player in the deal, and you have to Like Hall warming up in that Brewers lineup, Hart, Hardy, Fielder, Braun, Hall..     As i said, if Perez has value to your pitching staff, take the deal, if not, i would be unsure, but leaning towards accepting without knowing about the rest of your team.

55a405f9faa8a82293be4a246051376caa	It's a solid team on paper but I don't know what kind of scoring format you guys are using.  I don't know what kind of bench you have too.   Personally you need one more stud RB.  Henry and Westbrook are tend to be injury prone.  James is just getting old. You have two good receivers.  TE is alright.  Defense is top flight and your Kicker is pretty reliable.|`|AA12200210	Wow, very impressive team.  But on a second look, this HAS to be part of an 8 team league.  At any rate, its still a solid team.    Brady is obviously a top 5 QB.  Henry, James, and Westbrook are all solid fantasy backs.  The key with them being that they do not share carries.  This is key for back consistancy.    Wayne and Owens are both top 5 recievers - kudos for filling those roles.  I personally consider Winslow the 2nd best TE when healthy.  Hope you have a good backup as he is currently injured.  Once back there is no telling what he can do - he lines up in the slot on 80% of the Browns' plays so he is essentially a reciever.    Ravens D is a top choice there as is Wilkins at kicker.    Nice job even in an 8 team league.    Do work|`|s0MmAWcQaa	i would try to upgade at the rb spot (travis henry)  depends on your bench what trade you could make  Def is fine  K is fine  Wr is fine  wesbrook is good  Brady is great  i have questions about winslow only because of the Qb situation|`|KrFwTqDqaa	GREAT TEAM!!!! Brady has so many targets this year(if you can pick up Ben Watson or Wes Welker you will be in good shape) Travis Henry will have a great year with the Broncos(which hb doesnt?) Reggie Wayne is a great reciever so is t.o but i think your worst player is james because of his o-line and I LOVE the Ravens defense
oFOY5kfwaa	Il discorso scarpe da corsa  estremamente delicato e soggettivo. Dobbiamo tener conto che le scarpe sono lo strumento che ci serve per appoggire il piede durante la cosa e che pertanto sono la parte pi importante dell'allenamento e della gara. Non esiste la scarpa perfetta ne tantomeno la marca perfetta, dipende dalla calzata. C' chi preferisce le Nike, chi le Adidas, chi le Asics. Bisogna provare e riprovare finch si trova quella che calza a pennello, ne troppo stretta ne troppo larga. Io le preferisco di circa mezza misura pi grande rispetto al mio numero di piede perch durante la corsa il piede tende a gonfiarsi leggermente, specialmente se fa caldo. Consigliare una marca, o un tipo di scarpa pertanto  assolutamente improponibile. Io personalmente uso le Nike Air perch mi calzano bene. Attualmente corro con un paio non troppo costoso, le Nike Air Pegasus che costano circa 80 euro, per una donna consiglierei le Nike Air Zoom, ce ne sono di vario tipo e i prezzi variano, ma generalmente si va da un minimo di 50 ad un massimo di 120 euro per gli ultimi modelli.|`|aa0e62c9d0fc92bfa642e6ac2ed94a24aa	io corro pi o meno regolarmente da pi di un anno, e mi sono fornito da Decathlon (vivo a Bologna) dove ho trovato commessi gentili e professionali. Mi ero prima un po' consigliato con persone che correvano da pi tempo. Personalmente ho optato per un paio di scarpe running della Kalengi, credo di aver speso attorno ai 50 euro, forse quialcosa di pi, non ricordo con certezza. Quello che mi ricordo  che mi han detto in molto che sotto ai 40 euro  difficile trovare scarpe di qualit. E un consiglio che mi sento assolutamente di sottoscrivere  quello di non cercare le scarpe pensando solo al risparmio. Puoi risparmiare su tutto, ma non sulle scarpe, che devono essere di qualit: comode, leggere, ma anche robuste, di materiali buoni, ti devono dare un vero comfort e sostenere il piede.  ...Fra l'altro, avere ai piedi scarpe del genere  una sensazione molto bella, per quanto sono leggere e capaci di fasciare e sorreggere.    Buon acquisto, e soprattutto buone corse!|`|xnOzIYwxaa	Ti conviene andare nel miglior negozio della tua citt dove sai che trattano scarpe da running e fatti consigliare.  Se sono seri ti chiederanno se hai problemi di pronazione, il tuo peso, quanti chilometri fai in genere all'anno, etc. Non fermarti all'estetica della scarpa (certo,  anche questo un fattore importante), ma pensa al tuo benessere. Non immagini quanti problemi potrebbe darti un acquisto incauto, che quindi potrebbe farti passare la voglia di correre. Ricordati di indossare le nuove scarpe per qualche giorno, al lavoro, in casa, per passeggiare, insomma non partire subito a razzo, ma "ammorbidiscile".  Visita il mio sito  http://it.geocities.com/correreamantova  scegli una tabella e parti.  Buona corsa!!|`|74b5b56862a5ed6771e58d9f13dd227daa	La scelta delle scarpe per correre e' molto importante. Non ti affrettare seguendo consigli di altri compagni di corsa, ma entra in un negozio specializzato e fai una scelta basata su parametri tecnici come:  - il tuo peso;  - il numero di km percorsi alla settimana;  - il ritmo medio di corsa;  - le esigenze di utilizzo (gare, campestri, allenamento etc)  Inizia a verificare su web quale potrebbe essere la categoria o addirittura la lista dei modelli di tuo interesse:  http://www.scarpe.it/primavera/index.php  Poi esiste la possibilita' di rivlgersi a negozi di scarpe di alto profilo che fanno analisi sulla struttura del corpo e sulla dinamica della tua corsa prima di consigliarti un piaio di scarpe (uno l'ho sperimentato personalmente, su consiglio di Luca Speciani http://www.crsport.it/ grazie a loro ho eliminato un problema di dolore alle spalle!).  Infine esistono negozi di ortopedia che possono realizzare delle solette personalizzate, in modo da ottimizzare la calzata.|`|yEjlOXx2aa	innanzitutto bisogna capire che la comodit  varia da piede a piede... attualmente io uso un paio di nike da 60 molto confortevoli e resistenti io quindi ti consiglio una scarpa nike della serie air che non costano molto e sono confortevoli grazie al cuscinetto d'aria sotto al tallone|`|BoJaWso5aa	Io mi trovo molto bene con le Nike.|`|bJStiZaUaa	Dipende da persona a persona... io che faccio atletica uso le Adidas Running altre mie compagne NIke!! In ogni caso basta andare in un negozio di articoli sportivi e chiedere scarpe per la corsa!!!

Na minha opini?o, deveria haver elei??o direta e aberta, para o cargo de Presidente da CBF, com participa??o dos torcedores que estivessem interessados em votar, pois o torcedor, contribui em muito para a grandeza do futebol e em hora importantes, sempre  relegado a segundo plano.

3823d01aa0a1b3df6709ae71a987ea49aa	Nahh, you'll be fine. Drop Myers and pick up another closer like Jeremy Accardo or Brad Hennessey that might be available in your league.|`|MnjOXJnJaa	if you get rid of Myers, prepare to feel stupid when somebody snags him off waivers.    if you're deep at another position then go ahead and try to get another closer. you never know how many save opps the Cubs are going to give Dempster, and Myers isn't back yet- although he should move right back into the closer's role. it definitely wouldn't hurt to trade for another or pick up an available one (although it's doubtful any are available).|`|0iMYQ3STaa	Yes.     You need more than two options at closer to compete for saves in any league. Myers is no longer an option. He was only filling in for Gordon, and Gordon's farther along in rehabbing his injury. Grab Alfonseca for now, he's got the job in Philly until Flash returns.
MnjOXJnJaa	who's in front of him? Gordon is still hurt, and still old & shaky when he returns. Alfonseca has been getting it done, but isn't as lights-out as Myers. Myers is perfect for that role. once he returns, he should reclaim it quickly, if not immediately. he's better than Dempster, but there's nothing wrong with having 3 closers, or even more.|`|4BfmDMJCaa	Myers should be back probably in the next two weeks. I would keep him. He should resume the closer's role when he returns.|`|MkkCeObIaa	Its a long season.  You need to be patient.
0c2fb3f770440ea30fbbe62cc330e797aa	I think this is a decent trade because you are getting jake peavy. Chris Young is just a throw in.|`|87826378f29595e6b5b7bf66af6c52d3aa	Agreed with Steve, Rollins had NO HR in may.    No way is Peavy worth Young and Lee, you need to get another player of quality in that deal.|`|hCsaNZ5yaa	I would never do that trade.  First of all, Chris Young is very good.  Hes not as damned sexy as Peavy, i will admit.  But to say that you are "not hurting for HRS because I have Byrnes, Gary Sheffield, Rowand and Rollins"  Only Sheffield has big home run potential and he is old, so he could struggle again.  Lee blows those other guys away and your team looks weak without him.  Don't do it, and whenever Peavy pitches, you can dream of what might have been.|`|EX8FOnVpaa	Well i say thats a good trade but at least get an ok player as well. If theres a good free agent thats a plus too.|`|KVDpehALaa	this may be one of the worst trade offers I have ever seen...    don't ever make this trade unless you are mailing it in the rest of the way, and you boy needs help with his team.    Chris Young may not be the best pitcher on the Padres staff, buy Carlos Lee is leading the NL in RBIs, and have you seen MM Park, I could hit 40 HRs there in season, what do you think he'll end up with, 'specialy since he's got protection now from Pence and Berkman.    If you make this trade, will you please join my fantasy league next year?
MPkMpa94aa	I'd probably say Kelly Johnson- he's playing well, but he's on pace for less homeruns than Willingham and Hill, and Willingham is also on pace for about 20 more RBI's. Plus with Utley, Kent, besides Hill, you can spare him easily.     Another option would be to try and do a 2-for-1 trade for someone else. Try packaging Eric Byrnes and someone together to sell high on Byrnsee.|`|AA11948587	kelly johnson or aaron hill|`|ydpJ0pSBaa	Try dealing 2 players for 1 better one.  Trade the player you would drop and another guy. If not I would drop K. Johnson...you already have utley and kent. dont need johnson.|`|yM26YLKlaa	Drop Willingham and start mauer at utility
AA11491831	he will be back probably by july, so hold on to him for now pick up alan embree for spot saves he is their closer for now. Just wait he will be worth it.|`|devkYY1Jaa	I think he is still definitely worth holding onto eventhough he is hurt. When he comes back he will still get plenty of save chances. It also depends on what is available in your particular league you are in. If other viable options are available then it would  be worth considering dropping him.|`|5673ef8ed5e8008f074e69bcf4c7d2b9aa	Life isn't fair.  But he's too good to just drop.

Jax D is too good.|`|vOHqD2Ryaa	just a hint ALWAYS start the QB that is playing the Cincy defense, they are HORRID.    As for the RB, i say take Morris not because he will do good, but for the fact that Earnest won't be able to run against that Jags defense, they just beat up by Indy on monday, so i think they are going to bounce back in a big way this week.|`|AA10500250	Ben and Morris|`|IGKjaCQSaa	YES START BEN|`|bzmRqKH7aa	I would go with Big Ben and Graham.  While the 49ers have not been playing well, there defense has.  Cincy has been the village bicycle of the NFL defenses this year.... everyone has ridden around them.

Capirei se tu proponessi il boicottaggio dei prodotti made in Cina, avrebbe senso anche un embargo, l'isolamento di una nazione che vieta i diritti umani, ma boicottare la visione delle gare olimpiche, per poter incidere sull'economia di uno stato  veramente una gran cavolata; le Olimpiadi sono per la Cina un occasione di apertura al mondo per il futuro e non uno strumento di guadagno. Le Olimpiadi semmai porteranno guadagno alle multinazionali occidentali. La politica e gli interessi avvelenano quotidianamente tutto ci che ancora c' di buono. Tu dici di no, ma forse qualche altro estremista che non si accontenta dell'auditel ci sar e a Pechino io non vorrei mai dover riassistere alla tragedia di Monaco '72. Le Olimpiadi sono degli atleti e di chi crede ancora nei valori dello Sport e mi dispiace per il Tibet, ma il problema di questa regione e dei suoi abitanti deve essere risolto con strumenti un p pi efficaci!|`|eyDy2hO1aa	i telegiornali mandano in onda quello che vogliono... mandano i video delle manifestazioni in tutto il mondo contro la cina ma non mandano i video dei negozi dei cinesi dati alle fiamme a lhasa(dentro c'erano persone) dai tibetani "pacifisti", delle banche, auto, distrutte sempre da tibetani  poi c'e' stato la guerra sul numero dei morti: la maggior parte delle persone morte erano cinesi e le persone bruciate vive(detto e ridetto nei telegiornali) altro che non erano i cinesi dei negozi dati alle fiamme dai tibetani. per questo la tv non specifica di che nazionalit sono i morti. non si pu neppure dirvi di informarvi bene perch vi arrivano notizie controllare e solo tipi di notizie a senso unico cio contro la cina. qui non ce libert.|`|dV0hktbOaa	ma va va io me le voglio vedere le olimpiadi|`|jN4l4V6Baa	A ME PIACCIONO LE OLIMPIADI .....

I weight 165 and im thinking about playing defensive end. It is about strength speed and quickness for end. And another thing....size does not matter! Also I know of huge strong people who can't play football. It is about heart and technique and who wants it more.|`|b4e74d2e5bc87e1c3af228722d6abc4baa	I don't think that is small at all for a 14 year old wanting to play DE, especially considering his height. When I was 15, I played DE at 5'11" and 160-165. I was an excellent player, too, making up for my lack of girth (which wasn't too small considering age) with quickness (beating my lineman consistently) and long reach ... blocking passes, reaching for a jersey to trackle, or wrapping up for a sack.     If he is determined to play DE, he needs to prove to the coach he's the man for the job. If he succeeds, then over the next few years he'll need to gain a signifigant amount of weight for HS ball and hopefully add a few inches to his height. But at his age, size isn't too much of a concern, fundamentals are.

Anyone can score 80 points in a game if your team feeds you the ball like every 5 seconds.|`|Fsg8X88raa	Yes  kobe has become a bad player. he has no sportsmanship.|`|f8c251a8cd110663947fbaceea37268aaa	When you work for an organization like the NBA, that is full of thugs, greed, and immature millionaires, that atmosphere will inevitably rub off on you. It is an unfortunate reality. Playing professional basketball, greeting the fans, doing community programs, and conducting pleasant interviews may be long gone and it is a shame. A professional at any job must act accordingly and the NBA is getting a failing grade.|`|Dm2UXfhLaa	Give me a break, all good players in the league are dirty players. You don't get to the NBA by playing clean. If you've played any type of organized basketball, you know this is true.    Everyone holds, elbows, pushes off, undercuts, exaggerates fouls etc etc. Bird did it. Jordan did it. Malone did it. It's part of the game; deal with it, and is one of the many facets of a good player.|`|40bdb6f0d9f800add68bf8825fa0b122aa	Kobe is a punk...!  wait until they do the same to him....i really would like to see his reaction.    If it is a men game my friend, how come they are calling flagrant fouls?  get your act together and follow the rules...    If i was out on the court, and kobe did that to me, I would definitely go after his ***.... but wait they would call a technical foul on me.....see the point...!!!!     Still convince that is a maen game...!?    it is.....|`|2c3d5b0090307a3b82ca5cda13baaf20aa	I feel he has.|`|PY4gI42Maa	If you check the video evidence down below you can see Kobe's natural shooting motion differs greatly from the two times he's assualted Ginobili and Jaric.    I'm not so sure he's dirty, but I don't see how he can do such deliberate acts and expect to get away with it. There is definitely a pattern forming here.|`|408da6bb55ad956c4a3f27375faa6ee5aa	yes|`|c4b7408c79a4fc3f71698387c357e2c3aa	You can't "become" something you always were.|`|8d56eae75c48bc54632aee45b92b17e2aa	I think that he has been a dirty player for a while now and I'm sure that there are a few guys in the NBA that will agree. The cheap shots, using the off arm, and kicking with jump shots are things that Kobe has been doing for years. Now he just gotten so arrogant that he has become right out blatant with it because he feels that he is untouchable by the league. He is a great player but he needs an attitude adjustment.
cgrNd36Haa	Yes. I think they play like a bunch of sissies now.|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	NO|`|b1f15f9e53b33ee2dadd93b3ec1896d6aa	In the instances you are referring to I agree with you, but I also think the referees should be more strict with respect to things like traveling.|`|y2dPy6xRaa	no because that ruins the reputation of the NBA|`|TZvil8h6aa	yes........but crying after a loss is like an attitude I'd expect from Jr. High/High School basketball players|`|1b19a5ae9aeaae9afda4450a0ede52e2aa	Yes!|`|3b98ad6036605bbbea9d98d3dcd49f1faa	No, players shouldn't be whiny and jumping up and down every time they get called for a foul.     They can show emotion like football or soccer players but they shouldn't be allowed to act like clowns.     The new rule is working.|`|1eb7136714fb6d3757111b881911343daa	No, because if they argue the call will not be changed. If they don't argue the call won't be changed. Either way their emotions won't change anything. I think all complaints should stay on the bench.|`|tBsEHospaa	I think refs need to find the right balance. Some players just love to keep on crying after a call, and some get t'd up for the smallest comment.
7f233d8c0455ff32a6ec5cb49674c589aa	try a billard place|`|ba4e3dac1254bb12670a9e3bab294b6aaa	try any sports place *****, Sports Auth, or try a billiards/pool shop|`|AA11983196	It really depends on what you mean by good. If you play everyday you will need a top quality board, and you should look for a brand name board. If you just throw darts every once in a while almost any bristle board will do.    If you shop at a local sporting good store they will have various qualities of boards and cabinets to choose from, but first I would do some on-line comparison shopping. If you have a dart store in your town the owner will likely be able to help you make a good choice.    I would also add that it's wise to comparison shop before shopping at a billiards or game store, because much of the time darts is just a sideline and quality of the boards may vary.    As for the Oak Cabinet it's possible to buy a custom cabinet from various on-line vendors.

I tried to find it on the web, and there was simply no good information that I could find - sorry dude.    I'm sure the Lone Gunmen would know off the top of their heads - but it may be something that the Cancer Man hid from public domain.

GiOTYetaaa	I'm a Warriors Fan myself. Even though I would pick Dallas to beat them (in six or seven games), a major upset of this caliber is not out of the question. Don Nelson knows Avery Johnson and the rest of the Mavericks too well being that he was a recent mentor and had to leave due to health-related problems at the time. Also, Warriors have a quickness (one of the best fast-break teams in the league) and defensive capability that can give Dallas problems and match up well.    However, you're talking about regular season , and the playoffs are a whole different creature. Plus, the Warriors did not clinch a playoff spot yet. They have to get by the Clippers.|`|Bl3P6z3Laa	this is definitely a match up the Mavs will be concerned about.    i think if this were a first round matchup, the warriors would come in very positive about beating the mavs. but i would argue that the mavs have experience in the post season, something that the warriors dont have. and that could be the critical factor that helps tip the match up.    both run and gun, so it will be down to match ups. providing everyone is healthy, i could easily see this one going to 6 games with the mavs winning.|`|b6gtarUAaa	I'm a huge, huge mavs fan too but honestly speaking i'm not worried about any opponents they will take on the first round, may it be the clippers or warriors. . .  Come play-off time, the mavs will be ready to take on either one of them.  For sure, coach avery will be fully prepared  for that. He will design new plays & defense strategy against the warriors. . . I agree with one of the columnists (i think it was in sports illustrated) that whoever will face the mavs in the 1st round will act as sacrificial lambs. . . .|`|Uv2N2ToJaa	I think it wouldn't reach game 7 because mavs are good but it is a nice matchup between these 2 teams.|`|WRSKhWbEaa	if the WARRIORS make it to the playoffs, it would be an easy GS SWEEP!!!!!!! GO WARRIORS!!!!|`|AA11314600	As a Mavs fan, this is the one team I don't want in the first round, for the reason you stated.  Still, I have a hard time seeing them lose to anyone in the first round.  They have a TON of playoff experience.|`|qmBAgmnmaa	Easy mavs sweep no doubt|`|LCeegcYGaa	I think the playoffs are a whole different situation than the regular season. While they always play them tough the mavs are playoff seasoned and will bring that focus and intensity with them every night. The warriors might play them tough but they will have to up their play to beat them in a 7 game series. I like the mavs in 6|`|CR6sYBzgaa	first off I think the the clippers will get the last spot and I live in Oakland (Warriors fan). Secondly if the warriors somehow get into the playoffs they will get killed by the Mavs, most the serries goes is five games|`|408da6bb55ad956c4a3f27375faa6ee5aa	i think it will be a 7-game series because i do agree that the warriors give the mavs a hard time|`|b66yqbzEaa	lakers|`|AA11459034	I am a HUGE mavs fan. I think the mavs would win if we played Golden State in the first round. there is a 95% chance that dallas is NOT going to lose 4 to golden state, I don't even think we will play them. I think we will play the Clippers. so tonight is a potential round one playoff game against L.A. we would much rather play the clippers than Golden state. I also hope we don't have to play Denver. The good thing is we won't have to play the spurs or suns until the semifinals. That is the good thing because we won't have to play both like last year. anyways I think dallas would beat Golden State in probably 6. The mavs are the best so keep cheering 'em on!! GO MAVS!!!
qFyTLo6uaa	He should. He paid his dues by staying in college, backing up a talented starting five, and delivering where it mattered. And best of all, he is not a swell head who complains of playing time. He is a good team player. Look at the chance Ben Wallace got and where he is now. I see him in the same mold as Big Ben, with a better shot and a better range. He should be considered during draft night.|`|PiTL3Pb4aa	Yes he does. He is a big strong black guy. he wouldve started on almost any other team. He was the sixth man of the year in the SEC. He has 2 national championships, so he nows how to win the big game. I think he will have a better career than Joakim Noah will. He is a dominant defender and a strong rebounder.|`|c7655b174d9121c6b606d4538fa6a42eaa	hell yes|`|AA11204785	No, he shouldn't be drafted.

BVCgrDxzaa	Look, I've been a C's fan since I was 9 years old, growing up in MA to boot!  But I can't see how such a trade would work.  Toronto has a nice young team that's been surprisingly good this last season.  Why would they trade away the face of their team, in Chris Bosh, for almost anyone?  As far as Calderon goes, that is a very different story.  He could be pried away much more easily but why bother?  Rondo has, for the last several weeks, gotten enough minutes to show that he could be a player worth holding on to. And I don't think Delonte West and/or Kendrick Perkins will sweeten any deal all that much.      Either Oden or Durant is the future.  Oden would be best due to his height but I'd keep Durant if he was at  2.  It's a bit sad but the future of the team rides on nothing but 250 ping-pong balls.  I just hope we, (all of us Celtic fans), have more luck than we did in 1997.  Because, you know, Stojko Vrankovic isnt coming through that door.....Alaa Abdelnaby isn't coming through that door either!|`|xca91UYcaa	yeah but the raptors wont do it|`|90baecbe3029033e6f4b3cb1f967a617aa	how about gettin a new coach|`|LCeegcYGaa	If they could pull of a trade for bosh than definetly go for it, but i dont think Toronto would go for it even if Paul Pierce was involved.|`|D3zd6Vhiaa	that could work.  If you know any websites to write that to Doc Rivers do it|`|qFyTLo6uaa	I would.. but the Raptors might be unwilling to. First of all, Ainge has to have a reality check that his team is not going anywhere. Even if they don't pursue the trade, Durant has a lot to bring to the table. He could be an instant contributor and Wally and Pierce would welcome his addition no doubt. It might even save Ainge and Doc their jobs!!!|`|Ell00iyqaa	First, no, I'd draft Durant if Oden was unavailable.  Think of putting Durant between Jefferson and Pierce.  That could work.  Jefferson is a power forward, but he'd move to center if they could get Durant.  Durant doesn't exactly look like a power forward, but his skills are too intriguing to pass up.       Second, the Raptors would never make that move.  Perkins for Bosh?  You're dreaming.  The Celtics could use Calderon, but the trade you've thought of isn't possible.  You can forget about Bosh, but Calderon might be had for the right package.  I think the Celtics are unlikely to make any point guard moves.  There's no question Telfair is a bust and West is better off the bench.  But Rondo has real potential.  He's a crack defender and can find open players.  He isn't a good shooter, but he can be an effective point guard on a team with scorers, like Pierce, Green, West, Jefferson, and Durant.  Rondo just needs more experience to reduce his mistakes.

I was about 10 when I first learned how to ski on the little hills and I am only 13 now.|`|T6INiDKiaa	Me and gravity worked together in the Austrian Alps to teach me to ski.

h1M17bG2aa	I believe he would be a very good fit with detroit.  He is their type of player.  Great on the boards, good shot blocker.  Even an offensive threat.  he aslo work very hard and goes balls out every game.  He is a little bit older though, and i dont imagine he ending up with the pistons although i would love the opporunity to have him|`|7T7P5yaPaa	Why?  The Pistons are doing fine without him, and Camby is more into the stats (i.e. block shots, rebounds) than showing up in crunchtime (see the Spurs-Nuggets game tonight).|`|61958deba0b4468fd1bbb7b279ca65c8aa	He would be a great fit for Det. Defensively he could bring what wallace once did.     The better question would be what would you have to give up to get a Camby, specially coming of the Def player of the year award!|`|jiIQaXrnaa	yeah bcuz theyll be getting a guy that could be better than ben wallace after that trade.     PS: marcuz camby maybe not be a better defender but theyre close and marcus camby can shoot|`|cb0aa7ed03290e23a6dab3c8518ab4caaa	Yes, I think Marcus could be a great fit in Detroit, but even better in LA, Kobe needs a big defensive guy he can count on!!!
gzEpSdruaa	Being on teams comes with commitment. Believe me, if you don't have commitment, it won't work out.  I know you may like track in all, but can pro athletes just say they don't feel like coming to a game and not show up? You basicly have three options.    1. If you want to continue and feel good, tell your coach the truth and swear you'll never miss a track meet again. If you don't miss a meet, your coach will trust you and you can get that bad feeling out.    2. If you don't want to do track or you feel you can't stand up for yourself, quit. It will just get tougher as you go on.    3. If you don't know how to stand up for yourself, but you won't ever miss a track meet, tell a simple lie. You can continue, but you may feel bad that you didn't tell the truth.    To help you decide which one to choose, you must think if you will have the commitment to be on a team. If you do and you want to feel good, choose number 1. If you don't, choose number 2. If you want to continue but you can't stand up for yourself, pick 3.|`|wuv98xrvaa	I know how you feel, the same thing happened to me for football practice, the off-season is crazy. I took a day off and didn't go. But I felt like crap the whole time because all I could think about was, "What the hell am I gonna tell coach tomorrow?!"      I lived pretty far out of town and we had no car at the time, so I said I had no way of getting to practice that day. It worked.    If I were you, I'd say I was really sick or maybe saying something with your muscles felt really awkward. Just don't over exaggerate.|`|A0yunKPpaa	You were sick. I see some stupidity here.|`|7T7P5yaPaa	Some tried and true excuses:  sickness, flat tire, family/girlfriend issue, running shoes were stolen, favorite pillow was destroyed by younger brother.  If you don't like those, I would use any of the following (or a combo of): flood, tornado, earthquake, locusts, UFO sighting, meteor shower, and that you couldn't sleep knowing that people take Global Warming seriously!
AfuuZeyfaa	That is something I'd like to see happen. That would make football (soccer) here much more interesting and exciting. Football isn't established here on the professional level enough yet to do that and the money nor the support isn't there to do that. Football here just isn't big enough to do that yet but hopefully, soon, someday it will be.|`|7T7P5yaPaa	Because the USSL doesn't want to pay part of David Beckham's salary!|`|UKoWPYBCaa	In my opinion there are several reasons not to merge:    * relegation is a foreign concept in US sports - no other US league in any sport that I know of has that.  * MLS already had to contract once, it should be very careful about adding more teams - it may not be able to sustain it.  * Infrastructure - MLS targets larger metro markets.  Their soccer-specific stadiums are mostly over 20000.  USL is targeted at smaller markets - their stadiums are usually under 10000.  It would take significant investment to upgrade those stadiums to MLS size and that money is simply not there in a smaller market.  *  USL serves an important purpose of creating/maintaining grass-roots popularity of soccer in US.  It would be a mistake to lose that in combining with MLS which is trying to take soccer to the next level of popularity - among casual sports fans.  * Distinction of MLS as a premier division and USL as D-1 allows US to have an inexpensive way to develop players.   USL is great feeder system, in addition to college soccer, and  eliminating it as such would make the pool of available US talent smaller.  * Dilution of talent - better to have fewer teams with lots of talent, than more teams with mostly average players - there are not enough US players yet to fill a league that big and there is not enough money to bring enough good foreign players (sure there are cheap ones out there, but MLS will suffer unless it brings over only quality players).  * Very few (1-2) USL teams would be competitive enough to play at MLS today.

Gi nei vari Act pre-Louis Vitton Cup Shosholoza ha mostrato comunque ottime credenziali, decisamente il team rivelazione.  Poi per il futuro  certa la riconferma del team con nuovi investimenti per poter magari ambire nel 2011 (o 2009 se verr cambiata la manifestazione da quadriennale a biennale, ma non credo almeno per ora) alle semifinali.

hZdJQL2waa	most of your power comes from your legs, so try to strenthen your legs, also work on your machanics, maybee your hip rotation.|`|bac0c08d67448ca69e882615d8e3b333aa	Speed comes from throwing a baseball and also leg strength.|`|Jv5OYGEKaa	For velocity, think more in terms of increasing core strength. Your core is your abdominal (stomach) and lower back mucsles. Your actual arm isn't really doing a great deal of the work in pitching. Strengthen your stomach and lower back and your hitting will also drastically improve. Throw less between outings.|`|GzP1gn0Faa	you could try lefting weights everyday   start small and work ur way up|`|biMINS1Eaa	I was a pitcher for several years.  By the time i was 13 I could throw a mean slider and fastball to 70 mph with great accuracy.  I suggest getting private lessons if you are really serious about it, a bit pricey but if you get them from a good pitcher, you will go far.  DO NOT learn to throw pitches other then fastball, change-up, and possibly slider (if you throw it right with no twisting).  My private instructor screwed me over.  He was great but taught me how to throw a curve ball with no twisting.  It worked great.  After about a month or two of throwing this pitch, it hurt so bad in my elbow (a wierd place too) I had to give up pitching.  Three years later, to this day, If i throw any type of ball for more then a couple minutes, I get pain in my elbow.  Its in the wierdest spot too.  So, look for a private instructor!|`|50BNfY0xaa	Study how the pros do it. After watching videos of how they do their wind up, you should see how to do it faster|`|AA10868706	The speed will come with practice|`|AA11397639	mechanics. Stamina. Arm strength (shoulders)  LONG TOSS!!!  throw every day long toss  its ok if the ball bounces 1 time|`|t68RW3klaa	First of all, legs and your "core strength" are a key to velocity and stamina --- so, get some long distance running in 3 days a week or more if possible... Next, if you don't have the velocity now, learn to throw a circle change, its the quickest way to make your fastball more effective.  Check the link below for how the best pitcher of all time prepares (Roger Clemens)|`|XSLvPFvQaa	First, How old are you??? If you are accurate right now and getting batters out why do you need to throw harder. Even if you learn properly to throw a baseball harder , will you have any control when pitching. There 100's of pitchers in the minors or some in majors that can throw very hard but still cannot locate the pitch. But, the best hard throwers Clemens,  Randy Johnson ,Nolan Ryan all come from the legs. Any pitcher will tell you that most of there power starts with the legs.

O piloto ter de mostrar que  bom no bra?o e de estratgia.    Com rela??o a largada invertida (este sistema pode ser definido como HANDCAP), sou a favor se for em rela??o  corrida anterior ou a classifica??o geral.

AA12200210	Though I think Coles is an extremely undervalued player, I think trading him for Vince Young (which is essentially what you are doing, you should just drop the other two) is a good trade in this case.  Vince Young should immidiately be propelled to your starting QB position and this will give you a nice schmorgazboard (sp?) to pick from each week depending on matchups.    You did a very good job drafting here.  I can't fathom how you could draft both Alexander and Maroney, but you did and kudos for that.  Both players must have fell, at least one of them by 3+ spots for you to aquire both of them which is a steal when we are talking 1st and 2nd rounders.  Holt is a very good  1, Fitz is a great  2, and Evans is a good  2 as well, therefore making him an excellent  3.  Coles and Jackson are very good  3 WR as well - its great to have such depth at this position.    For this trade, though, I suggest you try to instead of accumulating the worthless Gould and Mason, you also send Chester Taylor and try to nab a better backup at RB.  This guy must be desparate at WR - really try to get as much value from this as possible.    Vernon Davis, I think, will be the 3rd best TE this year behind Gates and Winslow.  Ben Watson is another backup capable of a starting spot.  Nice job with your draft - very good value.    Do work|`|AA12204915	YES!    Coles is a good player but getting vince young and another solid wr is great.|`|8fbcVUWZaa	u already have good wide recievers, remember if u do that trade u will have to drop some people on the bench to make room. try and trade one player for one player|`|RLEubGtfaa	yea u should u get a better back up qb and a better Kicker. if u need to make room drop grossman and kasay. but keep in mind of the Madden curse which Young is in it, so he will probably get hurt or hav a bad year jus like the others|`|KrFwTqDqaa	yes you have good wr's already and you need a good backup qb this would b a great trade
ELY4ak9Yaa	Throw his sorry butt in jail.  He screwed up so badly, what a waste of talent and opportunity.  His Mom did not raise him or Marcus to be like this, I am sure she is beside herself.    Too bad, but he needs to go away for a long time.  I do like the comment about working community service and shoveling poop!|`|IMaO9Ptaaa	He shouldn't be in trouble at all!    Dogfighting isn't any worst then eating meat, horse racing, HUNTING, boxing, football, and anything else that is barbaric.     LEAVE MICHAEL VICK ALONE!|`|a5c5900c29722447d775e84e6c0b89f3aa	The guy should get 5-10 years.  The pinhead had everything you could want in a life and the idiot gets in with his idiot friends and runs a criminal enterprise.  He needs to have his head examined for screwing up a perfect situation.|`|lS8HmvBjaa	he should work 10 million hours of community service at the animal shelter and shovel their poop and clean their cages for many many years for killing them.|`|Rau9YSCTaa	I think he should do about 6 months jail.(people do less for HUMAN murder) Then he should be able to TRY to make an NFL team. I think people are going WAY,WAY overboard with this.|`|haEsE8ybaa	I think he should receive the maximum penalty allowed under the law, and be banned from the NFL for life. The damage he has done not only to the reputation of the Atlanta falcons and the NFL is going to take years to repair. I think his celebrity status got him out of more than should have been allowed, because if that had been "Joe nobody" that got caught the Feds would have thrown him under the jail, but because he is Michael Vick he gets about a year in a country club minimum security "prison" a.k.a "Club Fed". The NAACP needs to keep their mouth (and pocketbooks) out of this, if this would have been a "white" athlete the NAACP would be throwing a fit if the same sentence or rather "deal" would have been accepted, instead of saying that he needs to be "welcomed back with open arms in to the league"|`|RK9bJPOmaa	i think he should. i dont hate vick or anything. i love that guy and his talents. but it was his fault, 4 dogfighting. y would he even do sommething like that to hurt the porr innocent dogs. well now falcons lost a star player, while the other teams have a better chance to wining.|`|J31XGX2zaa	And this has to do with football how....?????????|`|7ZSRdhuhaa	mike vick should be sentenced to 1 million hours of community service at the local slaughterhouse to help clean up some of his mess.
TE6Ba7Spaa	QB: Team 1    RB: Team 3    WR: Team 3    TE: Team 1    DEF: Team 3    K: Doesn't matter but I would rather Wilkins.    So, in the end, team 3 wins by a lot. That team is a very solid team.    Good Luck|`|KrFwTqDqaa	I would say team 3 but all three are great i just love ravens defense and watson|`|iGZ7uEjlaa	Without a doubt the 1st team is better. It looks like an all star team.

Medway, Massachusetts B team  33 Nick Pietla is sooo much better. He's 3 times as fast and a way better overall runningback. He doesnt have a youtube video yet but we're hoping to get one up for him soon.
KrFwTqDqaa	NO the west is much better yes the celtics are the best team BUT the west is much deeper with the suns the spurs the lakers the hornets are very good with chris paul and the mavericks have a good team is the mavs aquire jason kidd there will be championship talks in Dallas|`|ICFoS8r1aa	Suns   Spurs   Mavs  Hornets  Jazz  Lakers  Houston  Blazers.  No i do not think the east is better.|`|T8D3DnyFaa	Definately not.Sure the East has the Magic,Celtics,and Pistons,but that's it.    The West has the Suns,the Hornets(yes people,they have the 2nd best record in the west),the Lakers,the Spurs,and the Trailblazers just to mention a few.    So sure,the Celtics may be dominant against the East,but watch come the NBA Finals,if they get that far,it won't be as easy as it has been so far.They are only human.|`|WAX5mWBHaa	omg they will not win it and the west is so much stronger  Lakers (best team in the league)  Spurs  Rockets  Hornets  Suns  Jazz  Mavs  Warriors and other nasty teams most of the west is over 500 and if your team is not 10 games above 500 you will not be in the playoffs if your ten under by the end of the year in the east you will get in.|`|yzcITMxkaa	Just because Boston became better by adding two veterans who have max 3 years left in their old bodies.  No. West hands down.    What about New Orleans surge, and the Warriors being for real. Oh and Portland, playing incredible WITHOUT the  1 pick even sniffing the court yet.  Not to mention the powerhouses year in and year out: LA, San An, Denver, Houston, Phoenix, Dallas    East has: Boston, Detroit, and MAYBE Cleveland

LOL     I agree with the above answer talk to your coach about it unless you have one of those coaches that tell you to suck it up, then you go to a counselor.    Good luck but try the wet willy first|`|MSZDfLMjaa	hey dude im 15 and on the basketball team and seriously just accept it OR GO LIFT once and a while you know??|`|gJRFm0XCaa	talk to your coach- explain that you dont feel comftrable with the team  and if that doest happen, talk to your consouller  but thats what Adults would say  i would say that if they keep on treating u this way, leave the team and join those leauges in which you pay for  or if you have a friend on ur team, tell him that so and so is bothering you and tell them to stop  but if you have confident, tell ur teammares to stop  and take a stand and be like what the *** are you doing and maybe they might be soft and get scared  BUT IT MOSTLY DEPENDS ON UR ATTITUDE|`|bqmpcFcGaa	dont get down on urself. there is a reason why you made the team. every player, no matter how big, tall, small, or skinny has a purpose on the team. if you know that you r smaller than other players then u may want to work on things that can utilize ur size to an advantage. smaller players r usually faster, more agile, and better ball handler. so run like hell, break some ankles, and dribble your way to a win!     PS.: u will learn when u grow up that these superficial things will not matter when ur older. so be patient. (steve nash is definitely not the biggest and the tallest player either!)|`|b5jCmFiWaa	I play basketball too a couple weeks ago we had a tournament is ma.What i think you should do is talk  to them  and say hey  please don't pick on em anymore it hurts my feelings an if they keep picking on you then go talk to your coach. but make sure you use matthew 18 give them another chance.

be4d7da5e23458e4e928e45b6133f7f8aa	Although Rafa had won the CL, his record is still abysmal, relative to Man U, Arsenal and Chelsea. Rafa needs to get his team playing consistently again. Now Stevie G pranged his hamstring, I don't think so. Although Rafa has the backing of the KOP, he will definitely be sacked at the end of the season. His constant bickering against the club owners does not help his case at all. Remember Mourinho? Back to back Premiership and an FA Cup, still got canned. Rafa will not be any difference.  Who to replace him? Maybe former players like Kevin Keegan, John Toshack, Greame Souness (oops, he already had his chance) or someone from the boot room, Sammy Lee (Bolton fans will surely be very happy). Or maybe the Americans owners will appoint someone from the US? Like Bruce Arena.|`|5c0ea2e937929dc820b4f96293aa83a2aa	He will be sacked when they are knocked out of the champs league next week....

geih5vR8aa	probably a few guys, but other teams will retire the numbers, cuz they can't keep very many of their superstars.    Conine? He has a .285 average, and 214 HR's, and that's in 17 seasons, only 8 with Florida... lol. Josh Beckett? He only played there 5 seasons.     We're talking about retiring the number. Guys like Babe Ruth or Willie Mays get there numbers retired.... not Jeff Conine. These aren't just guys who played the game well enough to get in the HOF. They are guys who played a majority of there career with one team, who was an outstanding player on the field, and a great person off the field in his community.      Hanley would have to play another 10-12 years playing at an elite level, and break some records, and do it ALL with Florida...     Either that, or the Marlins have REAL low standards.|`|8sqOVMvNaa	Dan Uglla|`|d9755b1afe952617603d01f2e4c6acb1aa	Josh Beckett|`|V430UrvFaa	I'll go with Conine, Josh Beckett will be next, but Conine will come first.|`|5xIroQjMaa	Either Beckett, Hanley, or Miguel Cabrera. Hanley's the youngest, and Miguel wasn't with the Marlins for long, but I'd give  Beckett the best chance. Being a stud in the World Series for them doesn't hurt either.|`|mqgS6Dfxaa	Their first club president, Carl Barger.  He's already had  5 retired in his honor because his favorite player was Joe DiMaggio.|`|V25THlPKaa	They need to keep a player a long time.   Not develop and trade or let them go FA.    I see no one on the horizon..|`|uh2bkRrFaa	Carl Barger, for his years of Hall of Fame play on the field.|`|xG6sznSiaa	I think it's probably going to be Josh Beckett. He was one the main reasons for their World Series victory and he's been lights out for the Marlins in the season. Either way it's going to be a pitcher, since they never really had a stand-out hitter until Ramirez and Uggla showed up.|`|B5BWocvZaa	hanley ramirez? thats gonna be a while
5c0ea2e937929dc820b4f96293aa83a2aa	He was on trial at Spurs for about two weeks in jan.... A lot of Sources said the deal was pretty much done.. But im Not sure that Harry though it was worth it in the end... And He believes Pelacios Is better at doing the same job... However i have no idea what is going on with Appiah now... He would be a good signing for arsenal as they are in desperate need of a Defencive Midfielder... But i still think it would be more likely for him to join Spurs than Arsenal... Just cos he has been there for a while and they agreed terms n sh!t....    Peace|`|EIsnATLxaa	im a liverpool fan but i think u need to get a player alonso him and fabregas would be sick in the middle with walcott and nasri on the wings and adebayor an rvp upfront|`|w6lVjQigaa	He is good midfielder. I think Tottenham should have signed him so he might do your season good if you sign him. Maybe another Patrick Veira.|`|3638ecbacff09303c04d9f60a89e841baa	Not another midfielder you're joking, how many we got now?|`|L1QTSErIaa	He earned the nickname Tornado due to the fact that he is very dominant in midfield and is also very strong. A combative player, Stephen Appiah has a strong engine and good tactical awareness. He is an all-round box-to-box midfielder who is able to defend as well as create and score goals. But his is injury prone.   He is a decent player and at the right age (28) to ressurect his career. There is no reason why Arsenal should not sign him.   Micah Richards would suit the Arsenal style of play. Daniel Alves also fits the bill. He could make a move to England. Even though he plays right back, he does most of the dirty work at Barcelona. Wenger should be urged to sign either of them.
RFOf5dw0aa	I definitely don't think that he does. I'm from Florida and I'm a huge Marlins fan, and I have watched his whole career. I guess really the only reason I can think of that he never really get the recognition he deserves is the teams he has been on. I'm sure if he was on the Yankees or Red Sox or any other big market team he would be a much better known player.|`|5xIroQjMaa	Well, he signed what was the fourth largest contract in MLB history, and was signed to the Tigers no less. (not yankees or red sox) That's pretty big recognition. he's a 4 time all-star (and only been playing for 5 years), so that's pretty big recognition.     That said, he's young, so he won't fully be recognized for another 3 years or so when he comes into his prime (isn't that a scary thought, that he's only getting better). He's also played in Florida and Detroit , not exactly the best market for getting major recognition. But, I doubt many baseball people would leave him off the list of the top 5 third baseman in the game today.    edit: Well, so much for recognition then. I didn't even recognize that he switched positions. :D|`|geih5vR8aa	How much money does he get paid? $19 Million per season. I think he got his recognition. He just plays on a team of losers, so he never sees the post season, which is where you get National spotlight attention.    OH, and D... He plays 1st base for the Tigers now. So yeah, I'd leave him off my top 5 3rd basemen... but not top 5 1st basemen.|`|5EuOTAjJaa	Yes, because he throws a giant shadow that eclipses all other fat and slow players.|`|V430UrvFaa	For the first 5 seasons of his career, he was a Florida Marlin, and the Marlins get the least publicity out of all teams, so yes Miggy has had a great career thus far, but now since he is on the Tigers, in which they didn't do very well this year, Miguel did his normal production numbers at batting, but was bad defensively.|`|xG6sznSiaa	Well he's simply not a player who wants to draw attention to himself. He's one of those go do my job and be over with it type of players. You'll always see people like A-Rod and Manny get a lot of attention because they want it and they will do almost anything to get in the spotlight. If you have no drama going on with you, no one will want to know about you.
AA10068004	At first, I wanted to say Boston based on the stat that they have the most 3rd period goals for (65). Then I looked at their 3rd period goals against and they have the least 3rd period goals allowed (30). Hmmm... so that means they already had a lead going into the 3rd more often than not, thus not really making them a "3rd period rallying team".    So I'd say Detroit, who has a league high .429 win % when trailing after 2 periods.    Outside of stats and my opinion.. well truthfully... opinion is hard to go by on a question like this.|`|VjAoRpIhaa	sometimes the hurricanes do well, like against toronto it was 4-0, then we scored in the 2nd period and 3 in the 3rd. we lost but shut them out a few days later.    philadelphia also has had some good 3rd periods|`|YajYjjxLaa	Boston Bruins, Ryder is 1st in the NHL in Game Winning Goals (last time I checked, bout a week ago)|`|zYuDstYLaa	After last night, I'd say the Penguins.|`|FEIXGtQyaa	Whoever said Ovechkin made me laugh. Since when is he a whole TEAM. that's amazing.... and talented.      hmm.. actually, i'm not quite sure. last year, i'd say the penguins but this year i'm just not sure....|`|pOXw1pKWaa	Calgary Flames -- They can play from behind this year a little better than Detriot did last year....    I also think they have the best win% when trailing going into the 3rd?????   May be wrong-- IDK for sure...|`|F934e4HQaa	NEW JERSEY EASILY|`|axxQzOCHaa	Whoever is playing the Leafs|`|9vLzGwVqaa	Ducks,just because I like them!|`|J4xsLrnoaa	BOSTON BRUINS|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	The last I saw (about 1 month ago) the two Cup Finalists from last year were the leaders in this category, Pittsburgh had won 7 and Detroit had won 6 when trailing after two periods. (of 65 3rd period NHL comeback wins)     While both of those teams have struggled in the month since I saw that stat and another team might have passed them (although Pittsburgh had another one just last night) it doesn't change the fact that this question is not a matter of opinion.     Whomever has the most 3rd period comebacks is the best at 3rd period comebacks. Period.     I'm guessing it is still Pittsburgh and I am guessing they have in the neighborhood of 10.     Daven's stat of Detroit's .429 winning % is pretty high too though so maybe it's Detroit.|`|yIdwMPsoaa	pens|`|ee2981071a42643d323cba284e466becaa	Ovechkin.|`|jwPf5rsiaa	NOT Ottawa|`|rv6zl5t3aa	I'll go with the Bruins also. I've watched just about every game this year and there have been quite a few come backs for the B's. Another important thing that they are doing this year, that they had a tough time with the last few has been, Holding a lead.     Although I do remember the game vs the leafs where Lucic had the hit of Van Ryne, where they were up 2-1 and that seemed to break the momentum and they ended up losing 4-2. Then there was a game vs the Rangers where they had the lead in the 3rd period and gave up a goal in the last minute and then lost in OT. Oh and the Blues....crap and the game vs the Devils.....    Nevermind......The Pens!!! LOL!!    *** Bob- Yeah your right, I think for the most part they haven't had the"comeback" win in the 3rd, but going into the 3rd tied and winning, is probably more what I am remembering. I know they've blown a few this year though, but they are holding leads better than in previous years. Not so much of the giving up the goal in the last minute of a period anymore. We just won't talk aboot the St. Louis or the Rangers game....LOL!!
IPy8h0VVaa	Utley, hands down.  Look at the way he played the first few months of the season pre-injury, and look at the numbers he put up despite playing 3/4 of the season injured.  Utley is consistent, and will continue to improve while putting up great numbers.  Pedroia has the youth, but I think Utley will go down as one of the greatest of all time at 2nd base.  We haven't really seen enough of Pedroia to know that yet.  Dan Uggla is sick as well, and I'd probably take him over Pedroia to be honest.|`|qOZ39D8Saa	Utley no doubt|`|Qv8XQMQLaa	neither. Ian Kinsler is a more premier second basemen in my opinion. If he can just learn to stay healthy for a season the majors would see this. People often forget he was battling pedroia for the batting title til his hernia.|`|Y9fGe4H3aa	Pedroia is off to a to a good start , but jury is still out needs a couple more years on his resume, Utley has more power. Hmmm. I'll take Pedroia for his age , and Utley for his offense.|`|fQIxah8laa	I'm gonna be bias on this one. Dustin Pedroia. 2008 MVP BABY!|`|6fl7RrJMaa	Chase Utley. Not just sayin that cause im a philly fan. I truly believe he is better than any other 2nd baseman in the league. He's just amazing|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	Utley.|`|7zfcYRqwaa	Utley-but how about Ian Kinsler?|`|yk4S7uuraa	Dustin Pedroia|`|ZyfYh4vdaa	Dustin Pedrioa|`|TzaWANaLaa	Dustin Pedroia, are you kidding? I did not see Chase Utley win the MVP of the year. Pedroia has a better arm, and has better contact and power up at bat despite his size. lol|`|5xIroQjMaa	Utley, hands down. Pedrioa's got spunk, but he's not going to put up numbers year in and year out.|`|LVDoQ1Kaaa	Utley|`|geih5vR8aa	Can't go wrong with either one. Utley has more power. Pedroia is younger.    I'll take both, and move one to another position.|`|AA11435575	Chase Utley easily. Dustin Pedroia is extremely overrated.|`|WUuO6wbAaa	It's a tight one, but Pedroia, mainly because of his health. I can see the Red Sox winning more WS, because they're built to. They're a power house. The Phillies are more like one good team in the pack. The way how they won it was getting hot at the end and having an awesome bullpen, that'll eventually go down. Depending on Brett Myers and a 46 year old 3 pitcher can only take you so far.    I respect Utley's hard play though. He played like crap towards the end of last season, but to play through his hip injury, that was visibly noticeable in his play, showed some guts. Even as a Mets fan, I can respect that. He's hands down the best 2B in the NL, and if he continues this production, he has HOF potential, mainly because of the position he plays. Pedroia just won the MVP though. With all due respect to Rollins, who in many ways is overrated, Utley will have more of an ''MVP type'' career than Rollins. It wouldn't shock me if the Phillies get cheap and go back into rebuilding mode with Jason Donald as their starting SS after 2010, when J-Roll is a free agent.    People are going to answer based on their personal bias on here. Non-Red Sox AL East fans or other AL fans may say Utley. Meanwhile, some non-Phillies NL East or other NL east clubs may say Pedroia. Honestly, for what it's worth too, Dan Uggla's really good. He's not all that far behind either of them. I think the comparison of Pedroia and Utley is close though, because as hitters, they're two different kids. Pedroia's a lead-off type hitter, much like Jose Reyes. Meanwhile, Utley's a middle of the order hitter.|`|uj6v5MWBaa	this is very close    i choose chase utley because of experience otherwise dustin pedroia|`|R1uLSCP6aa	utley will always be better pedroia is just lucky he is  just in the right place in the right time|`|B5BWocvZaa	pedroia. AL MVP. plus, utleys injured|`|yqC51KXOaa	Truthfully i think they r both a little overrated. but i would say utley. he has the power, average, decent defense, better baserunning than pedroia, and can produce runs in the crowded phillie lineup.|`|HeWUbyHJaa	Dustin Pedroia. AL MVP, .002 away from a batting title, ROY and has as many WS rings as Utley in only two years of playing. Also, Pedroia can play SS. He was originally a SS, but moved to second after the Sox drafted Lowrie and there was no 2B in 2007. Utley will hit more HR and drive in more, but Pedroia will beat him in R, SB, AVG, and doubles.
XQoH9ZI5aa	Pat Lafontaine. It is a no doubter IMO......especially considering that Lafontaine is enshrined in the Hall of Fame and Turgeon is not!|`|QZicQ0kuaa	What is the question? Who is better? Pat LaFontaine.     source:  Sabres Season ticket holder|`|RlZvWkSIaa	Pat LaFontaine, he helped Alexander Mogilny become a star.|`|uQrIdrjfaa	lafontine definitley|`|UoUaO52taa	LaFountaine|`|CwaWiNzuaa	pierre turgeon islanders era|`|AA10068004	LaFontaine|`|WG4zNIlTaa	neither|`|0eab0b6e32b135981c458e469f63de2eaa	Turgeon in his prime|`|rv6zl5t3aa	Apples or Oranges?    But in my opinion (which means nothing to anybody but me) I would say Patty LaFontaine. I liked both players, just liked Patty better.|`|9THtgkKlaa	Are you asking who was more injury prone?  Because I would have to say Turgeon.  LaFontaine injured his knee and his brain, but Turgeon injured his shoulder, calf, groin, knee and brain...you name it, he injured it. So my selection is Pierre Turgeon for most injury prone journeyman.|`|6Fv2mo7Aaa	without a doubt Pat LaFontaine|`|fB4RfiCgaa	Lafontaine was my favorite of the two though I liked both of them. He was much more exciting to watch, though it was fun to see Sneaky Pete work the puck.|`|iNfDcN9jaa	Pat LaFontaine!|`|yIdwMPsoaa	turgeon thats for sure

It is 2014 though    Bluebell, its not just celtic..work will be done at ibrox also and hopefully they build the light rail system from the airport to hampden and and other areas in the south side.    also they dont need to spend so much money around ibrox as there is already a better road (M8) and the underground plus the fact that david murray is spending 750m in the area lol.    Their could be knock on effects for the city and the country as a whole if all the planned improvements are made...it could encourage investment after the event, it could encourage people to move to glasgow from abroad and hopefully it shows glasgow in a better light as has already been mentioned....if all this happens we may even see the sectarian issues fade away|`|cTTmHn9paa	Celtic Park will.

Mi3rHjcYaa	I want Amare on the Lakers, but its never gonna happen. Phoenix will only trade to a Eastern Conference team.    I think Chicago has the most to offer (Tyrus Thomas, Joakim Noah, Luol Deng)|`|0E8SPyyXaa	Ya more cap space for us in 2010 man i would love it|`|N2177Ameaa	HELL YEAH, I'd love to see him in my team (Toronto Raptors).|`|P93I8CHtaa	i can hardly imagine him being in the lakers|`|F1xpcJ2Laa	Hell yeah I would love to have him on my team ..they can take Iverson too...|`|wuDplG1qaa	Its beginning to seriously look like a Amare for Bosh swap. why? One reason is because the Raptors GM drafted Amare and is in love with his game. The Suns are looking for a star in return and they get that in Bosh.|`|EKF2HdZKaa	wow.....  i think new york will definately be after him,especially since they want to look good for whoever is comin in this offseason  also the heat NEEEEEEED Amare since they have no good c at all  pretty dazled why toronto is up there....|`|3eI8jxqraa	I want Amare to come to Toronto|`|uFctHPExaa	where did you hear this?|`|dDhTMacAaa	While I like Amare a lot, every team takes on the risk of him leaving. I believe he can opt out at season's end and intends to if not traded.    Nash and Amare have incredible chemsitry and it's a shame that the Suns lost D'Antoni and are trying to make their offense revolve around "Shaqtus."    Right now, "Shaqtus" is a little prickly because it has almost the whole roster playing out of their comfort zone.    It's a shame what has happened there, and a bigger one that Amare Stoudemire on the their trading block.|`|kZw7zxlWaa	I want Amare to come to Toronto but the thought of Bosh being traded scares me, I like Bosh more.|`|iZgYcfKvaa	Speaking as a resident of Phoenix (though not a suns fan), Amare never rebounds nor does he ever play defense. When Marion was there it was masked because he was so good at both. Now, unfortunately, he's gone and so will the suns playoff chances if they DON"T trade him.    Amare is a leech, through and through; you guys can go ahead and have him, and then ***** every night he scores 20 but gets ~4 rebounds.     Also, Shaq is playing his heart out in Phoenix but he's not getting the ball from the leech, hell, he was 9/10 from the line the other night.|`|dqy2dAH0aa	Kinda scares me how likely An A'mare / Bosh swap is. Probably throw kapono in there,too.|`|AA11488609	Ernie Grunfeld better have something in the works to get Amare by offering Jamison, and even McGee for him!  If anyone needs help, it's the Wizards, and they need an established big man who can run with Gilby, and Amare can fill the void|`|3teWTOPqaa	Well Knicks will probably look for some help after the Kobe&LeBron incident in the Garden of Sorrow.
wurimjbnaa	It's possible.|`|5c0ea2e937929dc820b4f96293aa83a2aa	Probably not.... But not many teams will be that boring again.....

That's when Wenger had Senior players in his team.... Why does he feel he doesn't need that now????|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	No, they're not good enough|`|O9NHDTj3aa	its official i now hate arsenal fans they are gay|`|cjNtjOZtaa	I highly doubt it .|`|nFNF0P7gaa	it will happen again but  with more draws than the arsenal team got. for example liverpool have only lost one game this season,it will happen but who ever does it they def wont have the same points tally.|`|w6lVjQigaa	I think it will be highly unlikely but you never know|`|r8kRHyu7aa	Highly doubt it as well, that was back when Arsenal were pretty much just miles ahead of everyone
wBqJHNBjaa	@ Ema:  ManU is not a term United fans refer to themselves as. The term is only used by other supporters as a complete and utter insult to our club. The "u" is meant to be "you" by the rival fans.    An early example of its usage is this chant by West Brom fans: "Duncan Edwards is manure, rotting in his grave, man you are manure- rotting in your grave". The origin of "ManU" is a song to insult the dead Duncan Edwards.    Liverpool and Leeds fans copied this with their own man you /u versions to insult all of the lads who died at munich.    "ManU ManU went on a plane ManU ManU never came back again"    and..    "ManU Never Intended Coming Home" (if you combine the first letter of each word you get the word "munich").    I hope this makes it clearer that saying manU is an insult, particularly to the older supporters and to see United fans using it now is shameful. I hope a few might read this, understand and spread the word.    So... Please REFRAIN from using this term ever again!!!!!!!!|`|5c0ea2e937929dc820b4f96293aa83a2aa	Any Fan that Doesn't live in Manchester that started to support Man u over the last 15 to 20 years is a Glory hunter....

And he is a Martial Artist, his skills consist of:  Muay Thai  Thai Kickboxing  BJJ  Need I say more?|`|hBLNIlYGaa	since when is Rorion Gracie the ultimate authority on arts he's NEVER STUDIED?     the only reason the Gracie's beat everyone is simply because nobody else knew how to fight on the ground...it's that simple.     put Rorion in a boxing match and watch him fall.    martial arts are used daily by many people. i really don't know where you get that idea from.     if Rorion said that, it was a marketing ploy to promote brazilian jujutsu.|`|uToFh7Beaa	Doubt it.|`|zLUQJxJkaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrS2eRl76...    Fight one of them and tell me that again. Most martial arts are about fighting, those that aren't (such as Kung Fu) are still in such good shape that you can say nothing as to how they would do in a fight.   Hm let me see.. a trained fighter who conditions his body for hitting and being hit vs. some street mugger. Wonder who would have a better chance? I'm just being logical, I could take this way further. My guess is you didn't do so well with martial arts or artists, and you have something against them. Why is baseball in existence since it doesn't help us with anything in life?  I cannot speak for Rorion Gracie since I do not study BJJ.|`|YDpT2ClBaa	you obviously know nothing about martial arts.    why dont you ask people in the military how usefully it is to them, or the police department, you could also ask the fbi or cia, i know martial artist that  taught in all these places.    but a 5 yr old child like yourself would not know such a thing, so just go back to your playstation or what ever game you play all day.    edit:>bushido:>that one cracked me up, that expresses my feeling about this troll perfectly.|`|gJzEAvNTaa	where do you live?|`|b8e1755da720b51020434b3175ed1c82aa	I would like to start by saying that I agree with you ( to a point ).  I studied Karate and was a brown belt.  They teach you to hold back your kicks and punches and to be honest other than a good front kick to groin is pretty useless.  If your attacker takes you to the ground, Karate is meaningless.  if your attacker grabs you Karate is useless.  I now study Krav Maga.  Here we fight real time.  Use more than one attacker and defend against knife's/sticks etc.  We learn to strike all the vulnerable area's on the body ( throat, knees etc. ) and learn to match aggression and then go 10 fold.  I agree though that I could still get beaten up by anyone.  A lucky punch or kick can take anyone out.  That said martial arts gives you more than technique.  It gives you confidence - stamina - and most of all a battle plan.  If we were to fight I would be thinking about taking out your groin, knees, throat, eyes, ears, ankles etc.  The average street fighter would just be thinking about punching to the face!.....  Martial arts work but some are better than others.  Karate can be effective..... It's just not my personal favourite.  Ju-Jitsu, Krav Maga, Judo are my top 3.  Maga number 1.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	lol. If you say so.    Rorion Gracie sure does spend a lot of time training in these martial arts he supposedly deems worthless.    I highly doubt you've fought any martial artists at all. If you have, they must not have been very good.    You should probably tell your local police dept. that their training is worthless and would never work in the real world.    There's not one punch or kick or any movement at all that you could do that hasn't already been perfected and made part of some martial art. Even your most likely ineffective "superb natural fighting skills" that you magically created out of thin air, would be part of some martial art.|`|0VQJ4voRaa	you never fought any one your just a child behind a keyboard, grow up you little wannabe    edit:> anytime you want to meet face to face and but put in the hospital i will meet you.  you  looser|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	Well...hmmm....let's see. I am still here and I have used my Karate training to save my life against a gun, a knife and multiple attackers at least eleven times....If I had not had the training I do then I would not be here...so this statement is about as ignorant as can be and has no facts to it.    Even Rorion Gracie should know this and I have never heard him state this at all. They state that their BJJ is effective in both sport and actual combat all the time so I would like to see proof of this.    Edit - Yawn...another one.....post facts. YOUR post merits both a thumbs down and eventually you will need to quit believing in myth and come back to reality...but good luck anyway LOL.|`|LnJjS8BRaa	It seems pretty clear that the poster knows very little if anything about martial arts.    The fact that they exist still proves that they are effective because they were originally developed for combat. Winners went home and the losers went in funeral pyre. You can feed me a line about that being then and this is now but the truth is martial arts, when taught well are extremely effective for defending yourself.    Technically speaking, any form of combat is a martial art. If you box, guess what, you do a martial art. They aren't limited to asian styles, if you think they are you're more ignorant than you let on, and that's saying something.    You claim logic as your reason yet you back your statement with zero evidence. Show us a clip or cited quote from Rorion saying what you attribute to him. I don't think you will because I'm sure it didn't happen.    You're clearing just looking to start a flame war so I won't waste anymore time trying to have a rational conversation. I await my thumbs down.    Edit:: I just spend a minute going through your past posts, a lot of thumbs down to the largely irrelevent answers you give. And dude, wrestling is so 90s, I can't see how someone who still watches that trash can say anything about martial arts.|`|58e37d517ee1c00376f7fddeaa71cf1faa	Wow you're super Tuff aren't you|`|73nTYgdraa	First: If you don't want to do MA, then that's up to you and ONLY you.    It doesn't affect anything at all.  Second: No, you never ever defeated a martial artist, but that's up to you.    Third: Your so called natural fighting ability which does not exist will NOT save you from anybody wanting to kill you in real life. While our training gives us both the physical, technical and mental strength and discipline to go through our life in a peaceful manner, also without insulting other peoples beliefs or lifestyles.  Choosing martial arts is up to each and every one of us. It makes us not only feel safe, but actually BE safe if for example we'd get attacked, we also stay physically and mentally fit through our life, or at least most of it.  I don't know, you probably just beat down on smaller guys on the street who probably weren't even martial artists.|`|moa4kjSFaa	. . . .. . . . . . . . . . . ,.-. . . . . . . . . .``~.,  . . . . . . . .. . . . . .,.-. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .-.,  . . . . .. . . . . . ..,/. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :,  . . . . . . . .. .,?. .................................... . . . . . . . .\,  . . . . . . . . . /. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,}  . . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`^`.}  . . . . . . . ./. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:. . . ./  . . . . . . .?. . . __. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . :`. . . ./  . . . . . . . /__.(. . .~-,_. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ,:`. . . .. ./  . . . . . . /(_. . ~,_. . . ..~,_. . . . . . . . . .,:`. . . . _/  . . . .. .{.._$;_. . .=,_. . . .-,_. . . ,.-~-,}, .~; /. .. .}  . . .. . .((. . .*~_. . . .=-._. . .;,,./`. . / . . . ./. .. ../  . . . .. . .\`~,. . ..~.,. . . . . . . . . ..`. . .}. . . . . . ../  . . . . . .(. ..`=-,,. . . .`. . . . . . . . . . . ..(. . . ;_,,-  . . . . . ../.`~,. . ..`-.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..\. . /\  . . . . . . \`~.*-,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..|,./.....\,__  ,,_. . . . . }.>-._\. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .|. . . . . . ..`=~-,  . .. `=~-,_\_. . . `\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\  . . . . . . . . . .`=~-,,.\,. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . `:,, . . . . . . . . . . . . . `\. . . . . . ..__  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .`=-,. . . . . . . . . .,%`>--==``  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . _\. . . . . ._,-%. . . ..`\    wow go sit on a nail|`|04224b55dbe6d25a34730fdddf5252b9aa	___________________+88_________  ___________________+880_________  __________________+880__________  _________________++88___________  ________________++880___________  _______________+++88____________  ______________+++88_____________  _____________+++88______________  _______+8800+++88_______________  _____++888+++8880++88___________  ____+8888+++8880++8888++88+_____  ___++888++8888+++8888++8888+____  ___++88++8888++88888++88888+____  ___++++++888888888888888888+____  ____++++++88888888888888888+____  ____++++++++00088888888888______  _____+++++++0000888888888_______  ______+++++++000888888888_______  _______+++++++0888888888________  _______+++++++088888888_________  ________+++++++88888888           i dont think you would stop masturbating long enough to use your hands for anything else no matter how good you think your natural fighting skills are.|`|w9kSGLBxaa	hold on a sec    http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopi...    http://uk.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoug...    http://blogs.kansascity.com/crime_scene/...    http://www.mmaopinion.com/2008/10/06/llo...    http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/conten...

AA10087082	Borussia Dortmund have historically had the best supporters because they consistantly sell out their 80,000 seat Signal-Iduna-Park despite the team not mounting a serious challenge on the title for a number of years now.  Newly promoted FC Cologne has in recent years gained a reputation for having great support as their 40,000 Rhein-Energie-Stadion was regularly filled to capacity despite playing in the 2nd division.  http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/sto...

cd8fb1a8552a48786a6354cd99f5f249aa	people answer as to which they like best and say that's the "best".    EPL is the most FAMOUS league, i think it's more associated with the language, for some reason. and yes they do have nice stadiums and everything, but they have an unchangeable top 4 teams..Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool, Arsenal..no necessarily in that order.  La Liga is the toughest league, why? you have 6 teams currently fighting for a top 4 spot, you see the small teams win the big guys even if they're playing with their best lineups.  Serie A is more like EPL.  Bundesliga is somewhat interesting, especially this season since their starting to come in the picture more.|`|oNR7il8baa	La Liga :D|`|JCRdicqXaa	EPL.

wKnjGSU1aa	Well, I agree with it, US fans have to admit that most of the times against Mexico, most of the goals are on counterattack, set pieces, most of the times in the games, Mexico dominates, but U.S. always kills us in counterattacks, but at the end of the day, all of us have to agree that, it's still part of football. It isn't worth more or less than a Maradona-Type Golazo, they are all the same.     And to Davie Darko:  Playmakers, I think you are forgetting:  1. Cuauhtemoc Blanco (Even at 35, overall, has been a much better player than all of the U.S. playmakers.)  2. Adolfo Bautista (Just because he's not of the liking of Eriksson, doesn't mean he's less of a good playmaker)  3. Zinha (He's a very good player, no one can deny that.)  4. Nery Castillo (Come on, just 'cause he's not been playing as much as he used to, that don't mean he's less of a good player. He's very talented.)  5. Giovani (Wether or not he's on good form right now, he's still a good player, makes good plays when he is actually playing. He's still a prospect, just like Adu and Kljestan, they are not a reality yet either.)  6. Alberto Medina (One of the fastest players of the area, very dangerous to the opposing side, and a good playmaker coming from the wings.)  7. Fernando Arce (Also another very good player who likes to make plays up the right side of the field. Can be easily compared to Clint Dempsey, I don't see either better than the other.)    Come on, how is it just going to be Guardado? Are you serious? And of course, like Frank said, Ramon Morales, that's another, even at his age, he doesn't resemble it. He's still good enough to be in the National Team, but he isn't of Sven's preference.|`|o2kW3eG0aa	i say what ever sven comes up with is whats best for us.|`|4TzNaVnHaa	"The U.S. has nothing..." -- that's all I needed to know.|`|PowkYTGJaa	No because Mexico(and chivas) actually plays soccer and attacks unlike most teams!!|`|lrhOwySRaa	Honestly...I don't think you could change your style of play.    A team gets accustomed to playing a certain way.  They have chemistry, know what their teammates are thinking in each situation.    If their style is changed it will take some time to make that style flawless.  At this point in WC Cup qualifying teams shouldn't be changing much.  Injuries happen so those types of changes are a must...But changing a style of play...I don't think I would risk it!!!!!|`|DGkHpOFBaa	Hail or High Water...MEXICO will bring it this game.

Yeah it's robotic soccer, its all pre-programmed. The US has never had a creative player, this is why they sort to this anti-futbol. Mexico doesn't have to resort to that robotic soccer when we have talented creative players like Gio, Guardado, and Vela. Its worked so far, we have won more than anyone in the Concacaf, while the US still struggles and keep whining and crying.    Also has anyone gotten tired of their constant whining and complaining like little girls when they fail: "we were in a hard group", "we didn't have our best players", "the altitude made got us tired", "we don't take the sport seriously", "our best athletes play baseball". Grow some balls already, this is why no one in the world respect you.|`|oCTJ47gYaa	Im both a US and Mexico supporter being as i was born in the US and my parents are mexican, but im saying that mexico better redeem themselves in this game.    They gotta give the US a run for their money.    The US has just outclassed Mexico in their last couple of matches.  Many people are still saying the USA is nothing in soccer, but thats not the case when they go out and prove themselves with a win against top teams.    They can hang with the English, Spanish, Italians, and ofcourse Mexicans, Argentinians and Brazilians.    THey might not have won all of these games, but they have proven themselves as a force to be reckoned with.     As for those who even then still say the US is crap compared to mexico...name another country where soccer is not as big as their other sports and they can still play very well against other top countries?    You people need to stop being so damn ignorant and realize that US soccer is here and will be here to take on any opponent anytime...|`|r4a376Ocaa	^  I  I  I     LOL that guy is on drugs    Davie darko is on drugs too        Props @ Eazy beat me to compare players!

fLpnC8qtaa	That news is a week old Freshy..lol..lucky for Inter though hey... :))Bet Jose sighed from relief!|`|8xPYbHAHaa	don't worry, man utd will still outscore inter.  then don't blame the refs like you always do girlie.  and if low rank serie A teamscan score against the great maicon LMAO ROFL, then surely the likes of cristiano, tevez, berbatov and even rooney will.  one draw and one loss and who knows, inter may lose the scudetto.    HAHAHA.|`|lRotJdEWaa	I agree with the above answer.|`|cOPCNP7Laa	I knew that already but I still do not see a Milan-like performance happening.    Maybe you want to place the bet now? :P|`|hl9nqKQ2aa	Ok then...Rio will stop him + i think they should be worried about playing the champions|`|MjPd9vyYaa	LMFAO. You got some thing really big against Man Utd ;p|`|p1kmZziVaa	Be happy, now your 10% chance of winning went to 12% :D|`|7VwcvLTxaa	Pshhh, I'm still confident we'll win :D Inter may win in Serie A, but when it comes to the big leagues, they stand no chance :P|`|WS8MvKQAaa	lol go Ibra! haha ewww|`|cTaX7sFtaa	hahahaha Inter will smash Man U
p1kmZziVaa	Shhhh! Stop picking fights :P|`|mK06dus9aa	Inter and Juve are running into such a rich vein of form at the moment I am sure you are right|`|WdOAxQmoaa	LMAO. yeah there really going to get better with that scandal behind them..    it's like some one with a criminal record behined there backs, looking for a job,they will never get one again.|`|JCRdicqXaa	As if anyone is ever likely to forget the stain on football in general it created.    As for reclaiming I think you wil find it a disastrous endeavour.|`|XzhjWTA2aa	While the serie A commands a bit of respect it is still second class compared to the EPL and spanish primera, and once again it will be two EPL teams in the champions league final.|`|fLpnC8qtaa	Okie dokie..time to wake up from that dream bud :))|`|lRotJdEWaa	I agree with the above answer.|`|cOPCNP7Laa	As far as Im concerned during that "first" of the two years Milan won the Champion's League, European Supercup and Fifa Club World Cup.    We sucked in last year's CL and Serie A but it wasn't a problem with the League, but a change in the way the club was administered. This has been resolved evidently this year and performances are on the rise.    As for Inter, their European performances have remained the same for 44 years. If Juve have been in the CL last year, as they have this year, they would have given a hard time to the big teams, as they did to Real this year with pretty much the same squad as last year.|`|WS8MvKQAaa	La Liga owns both:P|`|MjPd9vyYaa	LMFAO. Thats why LA LIGA is the BEST! :p  But I like EPL and Serie A too :)|`|7VwcvLTxaa	Oh no, you're mistaken we got stronger. Sounds like someone's still hurt over losing to EPL teams in the CL :D
fLpnC8qtaa	accepted the fact they're gonna lose !!..no no, we are just tired of talking to brick walls..lmao xxx|`|cOPCNP7Laa	LMAO because I dislike Inter more than ManU. BUT if it was Inter vs Liverpool then I'd be all for Inter.    Come on, let's be honest here: we cannot have that 44 year run stop now, can we? ;)|`|HxET88bDaa	Blimey, you sound like a Liverpool fan now. Quite similar though, you both have been in the shadows of the other major clubs in recent years, if it werent for that scandal you would be nowhere:)|`|7VwcvLTxaa	NONE of us have accepted loss! It's like I've said all year we already have this match and the league won. It's in our destiny :D|`|p1kmZziVaa	I'm going to find you and beat your behind lol  Inter are losing. Sucks for you :p|`|WS8MvKQAaa	when are these bloody games im dying of impatience!|`|lRotJdEWaa	I agree with the above answer.|`|WdOAxQmoaa	he's a milan fan,i'm a rivel and think man utd will win also.     why cant you see this freshcucumbers?|`|JCRdicqXaa	Stop being so partisan.

jf0UV1Bjaa	NEVER give up something you like to do because youre treated with indifference. Im not going to lie, im 100% guy and it would burn my *** up if i was in competition with a girl and she outshot me.  Ive recently introduced my girlfriend into rifle shooting and she loves it.  I have a .22 magnum rifle and my ego was so big because i would knew i was the best shot around.  I could outshoot my dad and friends, my older sister and everyone else i knew.  It took my girlfriend around 150 shots in that gun to get... better than me. Its open sights too.  Shes got a natural knack for it, and im not going to take it away from her.  The first rifle she shot was a mosin nagant and theyre rough sights to shoot with and she was lighting up targets. So my advice to you would be do what you like to do, and although others might not like it theyre just jealous.  Stick around long enough and pretty soon everyone will accept you.|`|OAEuYZkZaa	Miss,    Don't let the jerks drive you away from something you enjoy.    Join that team and work your rear-end ragged to become the best shot on that team.  Embarrass those jerks every chance you get.  If it means you and your boyfriend go to the trap range on every date, that's fine, y'all will have fun.  And you show those idiots that it doesn't take a big macho man to bust clay birds.  Show them that you are the next Anne Oakley and rub their noses in it.    Hang in there kiddo, the shooting sports need young ladies like you!    Doc|`|AA12034449	your local gun club can hook you up with some competive shooting     contact the NRA ..they can link you to every shooting association in the country and skeet and trap shooting clubs are in every state.|`|nooi0ldjaa	if i were you, i'd go join anyway, and out shoot them all. even if you don't get treated fair you know your better then them...and they see it to. but if you give up because they are bastards you'll regret not 'blowing them out of the water'    anyone who says a girl cant shoot, tell them to bring their gun and see who does better (trap shooting...not a shoot out)    as long as you enjoy your self, screw them.|`|AA11306089	What you need to do is keep on keeping on. You're best bet is to finish up what you started..you'll only prove them right if you bail now. Go out there, show em what you got, and gain the respect you deserve.|`|ujIinLzGaa	I would stay on the county team.  Ignore what they say, and just keep outshooting as many of them as you can, as often as you can.  Practice until you can outshoot them all.  Be the best you can, and don't worry about what those people think.  If they behave as you have described instead of encouraging you, they apparently don't think.|`|GpzvrlHdaa	Just to add my 2 cents;  You have got a good thing going with your trap shooting.  You have been here long enough for us to know you "shoot like a girl", and are getting pretty damned good at it.  Like Coasty and the other 'old farts', a group to which I belong, I would advise you to keep on shooting those clays.  Show them up girl, we know you can do it.  It should never be that you get chased away because somebody doesn't think a young girl should out-shoot them.  Believe me, I am a very good shot, and I have been put in my place by a woman or two, both on the range, and in the field.  The guys that out-shoot you respect your abilities because they must to respect their own.  Pay attention to those guys who shoot well, and never mind the wannabes.   J|`|vea6mqPZaa	Join, and when they see you back and start giving you crap just say "Don't be jealous" and walk away.    You may find that they treated you crap to see if you would stick with it.    Also, go get the Tee Shirt that says, "Yes I do shoot like a girl" and the one for your BF that says "My Girlfriend shoots better than your Boyfriend"|`|V0qWtXOtaa	lol that funny. is it a requirement that you live in the county?if not join the opposing team.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	Always remember that the only person you need to be competing against is yourself.* There will always be people on this earth who attempt to discourage, criticize, condemn, complain, resent, find fault, act unfriendly, jealous, envy, and so on & on, But when you manage to rise above their pettiness and realize you are a better person for it, you will be  happier doing whatever you decide to do.* Best wishes always, and bust them birds.*|`|KMASS2Gmaa	Young lady I am a crotchety old fart and my advice is to look them in the eye and tell them I am going to compete and if you got a problem get over it. Sam Colt made all men and women equal. I can shoot as well or better than you can so get a life and get on with it.  Never let then back you up one step. My Dad was the sponsor for the JR rodeo team in our county when I was a young lad.  I was not good enough to compete cause three girls could ride anything with hide and hooves. It is like my Dad said "If you want their spot on the team learn to ride better than they do."    He taught me not to back up for no man or woman. I suggest you take that advice to heart and when they try to hand you all the dirty jobs. tell them I did it last time It is someone else's turn.|`|uVuCx3taaa	All I can say is you have got to be really good. I have noticed in my own life that many men don't take it well when a woman does better at a "man's" sport or job than the man himself. Keep it up. You are obviously very intimidating (and that is a good thing)! I love it!|`|It2jlZXmaa	G'day mate ,it sounds like to me that the other guys a gel louse because you shoot better than them.Stuff them i would join and stick it up them some more,people like that would make you do better,but dont let them get to you.I think you should join again and enjoy what you are doing and love the sport.My misses goes hunting with me sometimes and she is a crack shot also but not better than me but she shoots a lot better than other guys i go hunting with.Go for it and dont stop because of dumb asses.cheers mate
6KOEbjjJaa	yes it is true he is Natural right-hander and his uncle make him swith in young age to have a strong backhand or something and yes it is possible Sharapova is Natural left hander and she playes with her right hand look in here|`|N9pKl35Xaa	I was so confused a few years ago after seeing him playing left handed than signing right handed i was like 'wtf?!' but you know, that could very well be the key to him starting to become dominant..

That way he would have his dominate hand for a 2h back hand.  The next time Rafa is signing autographs, watch him.  He uses his right hand.|`|xBp89N7Laa	Something strange (special) about this kid. He is natural right-hander (writing, etc), but play tennis with his left hand. He also claim that he is LEFT FOOTED and that it is difficult for him to play with his right hand.  How many out there in the world who is right hander and left footer or vice-versa?|`|sptrtwxlaa	It's true,  and as you can c possible.|`|RC3WoqFkaa	it's true and possible. he switched soon after he started so he's been playing with his left hand for over 15yrs.|`|U7BkuEU9aa	Yes, it's true. The only thing he does with his left had is play tennis...|`|gCGbbIMcaa	Yeah! Rafa was orginally right handed. Uncle Toni changed this early on and switched him to be a lefty :D !
AA11712595	I agree with the last answer. Horrible. What is up with that? Guess you have to have some way to amuse yourself on the bench.

Feel tech'ish', tape the sports, then transfer the image to your computer.|`|AA11605092	keep your camera pointed towards the bench all  year long, because that's where is is going to be. I am a bears fan but respect what Favre means to the Packers and the game of football. But Rogers has to start getting some playing time if they ever want him to develop. I heard that Favre may want to play two more years after this. Rogers may be 30 by the time he gets his first start.|`|f53628911308df6b4ed8077f702d5766aa	Packers.com usually has gameday pictures, but I didn't see one of Aaron...that mustache was horrible!!!|`|af60dec109a9a6738c2da98d50036aefaa	Just go to Yahoo or Google.

lrQGZLV7aa	There may be several causes for your cramps, including muscle damage, lack of salt, etc. so hear are some tips.    .  Don't eat anything up to 3 hours before your gym session.  Have a good breakfast with low glycemic index foods (brown toast, fruit, whole grain cereal etc)    .  Make sure you are hydrated - so drink water during the morning and at your break time.  If you feel like you need energy before your run, then drink an isotonic energy drink (nothing fizzy and nothing sugar free).    .  Don't wait an hour then eat a massive lunch.  Your body needs something sooner - so eat something light after 20 minutes (maybe a biscuit) and 40 mintes (say a banana) then have a light lunch.    .  If your cramps start during the race, slow a little, exhail sharply and really stamp your feet.  This gets CO2 out, oxygen in and your blood circulating to dissipate any local problems in the cramped area.    .  Over the longer term you should strengthen your core muscles by doing sit ups, stretches, planks (holding yourself in a pressup position) etc.  If this doesn't improve things, then talk to your gym instructor to see if they recommend any particular excerices.    .  Rest & sleep well that evening and the day afterwards.    .  Above all enjoy your running    all the best    bboy|`|cKXZOLJSaa	eat some healthy stuff (banana mostly) and drink some good ol gatorade and stay hydrated. and don't try so hard, its usually when you start pushing yourself when it gets terrible|`|AA10184575	stretch    eat after gym|`|MPX0f5jzaa	It's far more about your water than it is your food.  I'm guessing you're not eating before gym anyway, which is fine.  You'd know a hunger pang from a cramp, I'm sure.    Hydrate yourself before you even start the class.  I know teachers like to open the class w/ getting everyone's heart rate up, and laps are the best way they know how.  You shouldn't allow yourself to run out of water before the class is over, then rehydrate again afterwards.    The thing that causes cramping is lactic acid building up in your muscles, causing a burning sensation.|`|TuOp3hNPaa	ya almost everybody gets cramps when there running an pushing themselves, this is good cuz ur pushing urself. all u can do is make sure ur hydrated|`|l1p5M0Q8aa	well if u hav gym in the morning, eat a medium breakfast. if it is too light, then u wont hav enuf energy.  if it is after lunch, hav spagetti. pizza could work but idk. bread also. gives u carbohydrates.|`|DcEBhY02aa	Don't eat so much before the run. If you feel like that breath in deeper. Or put your arm up on the side with the side stitch(cramp)

AS we all know la volpe did not include blanco in his team. Then after the world cup blanco was also not in the team, most of the same players sven called up for the U.S game. Then after world cup hugo sanchez gets el tri and does add blanco but he was benched most of the time. Copa oro he played some what and cope america. So the base sven has now was created a while ago with just some few new addition. Blanco was not really part of el tri much and same with bofo.|`|kPbou3Vdaa	There Jose Luis, I gave you a thumbs up :)|`|I5FsYmjIaa	Naa dude.

Mexico played good when Lavolpe was coach and el Cuau was not there, so thats not a common factor!|`|5x4MlPlHaa	NO!!! the reason is that america and el tri have awesome players but they have no chemisrty together they just don't click. that and that they are both missing a 10 but not cuahtemoc just another ten|`|Cpm25Pekaa	Yeah, but Mexico needs a playmaker and TWO FORWARDS.|`|WCf9V0ZNaa	no i dont think so...    i think that now there is no small NT...and that there is no small team in the mexican league...    like indios may have just gone up to the mexican league..but they are doing better thaan america..    arriba el america...tho|`|DGkHpOFBaa	Mexico needs more urgency!!!|`|PLhTgeGoaa	Good point.

If I had a level 2 account I would give him a thumbs up.|`|oCTJ47gYaa	Hell NO!!! Mexico is just having an extremely hard time putting together a solid team because their euro players arent always available (vela, gio, guardado, etc)    So eriksson is having trouble building a team because of this, and to make things worse, injuries arent really helping either.    So do we need cuauhtemoc back? Not really, What we really need is time to build a solid national team, unfortunately we dont have a lot if any time.     I personally dont really like cuautemoc a lot, but i dont want people to think that Im just slamming Cuautemoc just because i dont like him, Im basically just analizing what i've seen since eriksson took over the Mexican National Team...|`|oBn8Mha1aa	Mexico aint gonna do **** or go far if dey keep on relying on veterans. eventually  da vets wont play nomore, so start using em fresh young playaz so eventually dey get better , by da time dey become vets,|`|DcVknH1Faa	no i dont think temo is the reason but the directiva and the players from both sides dont do what they suppose to do.|`|nggzPv7Daa	Yes my friend, my America and the Tri have the same problem. America hires super stars players, but once they there playing for the team they feel like the last coca cola of the desert, they do not play for a winning purpose, they only play because they have to, thats why Cabanas looks good in the matches, because is the only one that plays with the heart. And with el Tri the is kind of same sh!t, now because they are playeng in Europe, or the are treated like rock stars in their teams they do not play with the heart, they only play to get paid. Players only should get paid if they win, is the only way they can improve.   And this is true my friend, thats why that teams like Honduras or U.S.A beat us, because they think like profesionals.

LUnscegvaa	You've reached Brown belt !!!    No one gets there without talent,determination etc.    Believe in yourself and remember what you've achieved thus far.    Keep going regardless and you'll get there I promise!!    Best wishes :)***|`|zLUQJxJkaa	You have nothing to worry about, martial arts is not about comparing to others. It's about comparing to yourself, what you were and what you have trained yourself to be. Try your very best, and you will be the very best you can be. Yea it's good to be respectful.. Just work your hardest and it'll get better. I got disinterested too, I kept putting 100% into it though, and now I like it again.|`|b8e1755da720b51020434b3175ed1c82aa	I had a brown belt in Karate and had zero confidence.  It's not your fault at all, it's your instructor.  Karate teaches you to pull back your punches or kicks.  Useless.    I now study Krav Maga.  Truly awesome.  All the techniques are easy to learn and very easy to use.  They teach you to attack full power ( Using pads and body armour ) have multiple attackers and make it as real as possible.  They do basic ground work and use kicks, elbows and incorporate a number of Arts.  Karate, Judo, Ju jitsu for example.  Learn Krav Maga - after four months you will be very confident I promise you this and also you will be physically more fit.|`|N5SVU6Xwaa	karate these days is a joke, do krav maga would be my first pick, and then muay thai and mma are good to, look out for mcdojos, belt factories what ever you want to call it|`|3DnX9NmAaa	Maybe you should talk to a psychologist. Have you been under more stress recently than usual? Anything traumatic or upsetting? If you can talk to your school counselor or preferably a doctor of psychology or psychiatry I'm sure that will help a lot. If necessary, the psychiatrist can prescribe anti-depressants to help with your depression.|`|OURb1rnTaa	dude, you need to work on your self esteem! for me personally, i would just get your black belt in that style, then leave! study mma, muay thai, etc. remember, that belt does not mean anything anyway. i used to think karate would help me get girls but they really don't care. also, you are at an age that's a little confusing. don't worry. things will get better.|`|AA12271834	The problem is not your skill but you.  You need to reach out for help.  Talk to your friends to help you through this.  Depression sucks and it is only easier if you have someone you can bounce ideas off.  Being in martial arts is about gaining self confidence and discipline.  If your not getting that from your current dojo, switch to another dojo.  Ask to start off as a white belt again and prove to yourself that you deserve the brown belt.|`|6nGII584aa	what does this have to do with martial arts apart from where u said u dont deserve your brown belt?|`|P6NzCumHaa	I'd suggest you visit you guidance counselor, physician, or a psychiatrist.  Depression is very common and can lead to lots of problems.    And this isn't anything to be embarrassed about; nearly 10% of the adult population in any given year has a depressive disorder.  It is super common, so talk to someone you can trust, ie. a doctor or guidance counselor.|`|fRosDAZEaa	Honestly, it sounds like you are depressed about something other than your training.  Consider talking to a counselor about what you have asked us.  There's no shame in seeking help.
bB5d5YVeaa	I used to be JUST LIKE YOU.    Here's the deal grasshopper....you need to compete against yourself.  Impress yourself.  Impress everyone around you, not with your martial arts skills, but with your skills at being a "decent human being".  People will come to know you as a "good person".    I hate to say this, but in hindsight, many of my martial arts instructors were not worth impressing.    You may dismiss this advice as "philosophical BS", but it's not.  The majority of people in this world are not into martial arts and most of them could really care less.  But, if you build a reputation as a good person both inside and outside your dojo, you will get earn the respect of many.  And, when some of them ask you "what's your secret?", you can explain that you were involved in the martial arts for many years and that was how you were taught.|`|iKbNyYvsaa	Beat someone up in 1 sec|`|YHrxMcNgaa	Well Try your hardest and never give up,thats alwayz the best way to impress someone|`|0d2ca0c6b83d05d2b0fd61039f7118fdaa	Show initiative, try hard, and don't ever quit.  Show them you care about learning the art, and you're not just doing it "because."    Ask questions, be involved.  Show you are actually learning by acting interested.  Don't suck up, though. :P    And...  PRACTICE.  Trust me, they know.|`|LUnscegvaa	Developing a  heart to continue on regardless and also perfecting your basics and kata.    Best wishes :)***|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	If you train under a real Sensei they will never be impressed with just your fighting ability. If they are then they do not know much about true Karate Do.     If you want to impress your Sensei just train hard, learn from them, listen, represent your school and Sensei with honor and be dedicated. Real Sensei respect knowledge and dedication because everyone knows as you age ability goes away but if you can apply true knowledge then you can be effective regardless of your age.     After 31 years I am not impressed by anyone who has trained less than 10 years since it takes that long to truly understand a real martial art...this is why you see so many people talking crap on Y/A...they have not trained with a real instructor or "think" they know more than the ones that have do with no factual support for their claims.|`|AA12271834	It isn't about how well you fight.  It is about how serious you are about learning and how disciplined you are.  Once you get to the higher levels in Karate (as will other rank based martial arts) there is more of a commitment from the individual.  A teacher wants to know if you are ready for that commitment.  Are you a leader or just there for the ride?  Are you worth investing into or just easy money in the mean time for the dojo (I know it is harsh)?  If you want to impress them, become more involved and show that you are committed to the art.  Become a leader and encourage others to improve as well (but don't do it in a jerky way).  Learn as mush as you can and always ask to learn more.|`|6nGII584aa	train hard do everythign exactly how you are told. dont screw around in class. be respectful to everyone in class.  its really pretty simple.    you dont need to beat anyone up.|`|G1nPkwivaa	Show good technique and control and be curteous always be aware of your surroundings never let yourself or your partner be pinned against a wall and dont be afraid to ask questions talk to your sensei and the people helping out in your class ask what they are looking for and ask for their advice

You eat too much and you don't look forward to Thanksgiving anymore.|`|a112fa2d0ccf1099eec1119d4da5e902aa	The worst in the entire series.|`|NIEt2CEZaa	That's my favorite rocky except the ending sucked cause the russian dude should of won. Rocky sucks.|`|ZzXxRLWcaa	The weakest and worst in the Rocky series...    Rocky's Dialogue was poor and unintelligable. I know they were trying to make him "punchy", but you could barely understand the dude. Plus, the fight at the end was lame... which is a shame because thats everyone's favorite part of the Rocky movies.    To correct the other answerer, Rocky IV was the one where he went to Russia to fight Drago. And that was one of my favorites too...    In order, from best to worst:    Rocky I  Rocky IV  Rocky Balboa (VI)  Rocky II  Rocky III  Rocky V    One man's opinion...|`|Xm8crry3aa	I actually like this better than 2 and 4. The realism factor is what i am going on. The Don King clone George Washington Duke and Tommy Gunn. This is true how a guy goes to the top and forgets were he came from.

aRy2ZvT9aa	Yes, he has already said this a couple times, I'd like to see him get another win or two, he is real good on plate tracks, he could win at Daytona or 'Dega. I love his commercials for Napa. He is a cool guy and I hope theres a couple wins left in him. But I totally understand where he is coming from as a Owner as well as a Driver..    Go Dale Jr & Hms|`|Qw4l9R68aa	He said that a couple weeks ago. I hope he sticks around so I want him to win some. I like him.|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	I'd be happy.

He does have some great commercials though doesn't he?|`|RLQdhFWXaa	Awwww I like Mikey. but it is true he hasn't had much luck lately. And maybe he should just let someone else drive the 55 car after the season ends. He said if he dosnt improve this season,  well how much improvement are we talking about.????  Not in the top 35???   Well I guess we will see>|`|JfVxCDb7aa	Maybe he'll Join his brother on fox news as a commentator. He hasn't driven very well for at least 3 years.|`|c3tADklmaa	Asta Luego Waltrip!!! I don't think he'll come close to his 2nd place finish at Loudon.|`|n55igpCUaa	Michael has had 1 "decent" season his entire career... 2001... his team now (save Reutimann who is madd awesome!) is nothing compared to even DEI of today, let alone DEI of 2001.|`|YQLLxGNWaa	he's never really had a 'decent' season. why would this year be any different?|`|7RUMbREoaa	Yeah,that was actually an excerpt from a couple of weeks ago.I think it says a lot about Michael and his ability to separate owner from driver and look at what is best for the company and the sponsors.It takes a heck of a guy to put his own interests aside and say "I have to step it up or find someone else who can".I hope that he steps it up and stays,though.|`|4l0yGuE9aa	I know that has to be a tough pill for Michael Waltrip to swallow but I believe it is one he is going to have to take. I honestly believe his organization is making moves in the right direction with the cars to be competitive. I think if he focuses on running that organization then it will be successful. It could have the potential to be very successful.|`|mIdcJEJNaa	Oh, is he still around??  Almost forgot.. Who cares...  Mikey was one of the most popular  guys in the garage,   before he won  a couple of races.. He was a winner..  Maybe not on the track, but among   people..  Now that he's an owner, and acts like a   (supply your own word), nobody cares...  He's just another loser both on, and off the track..|`|iO12Vjnvaa	It's going to be nice for NAPA to get a good driver next year....I have felt sorry for them here lately.    Just an opinion as always.|`|5LxpvXSmaa	i have always adored Michael and appreciate the honesty in his voice and the acknowledgment on his part that maybe his best years are behind him. He has all the announcing and being a car owner is enough on any ones plate.|`|W2R8TRDmaa	It's about time.  He's a very funny guy but I have never liked him and he isn't a great driver.|`|739f14d79f8285fdffb364bed6c305feaa	I like Mikey too!  I think he is just a big ole lug & if he is done after this year I can understand that, it sucks to always be in the back ;)  But Mikey will never go away he will be around you can bet on that.|`|YHYT8qMKaa	Yes, I heard about that. I guess if he doesn't have a good season, then it will be the best thing for him. Being an owner/driver is pretty hard these days. Michael's brother Darrell never won a race as an owner/driver as well as Bill Elliott. I think the future of MWR will be David Reutimann and Michael McDowell. But I hope Michael has a good season and stays for at least a few more years. He almost won the fall race at Talladega in '07 and the spring race in '08. Maybe he can get a win this year.|`|kjAsuC6Haa	He sounds pretty honest.    I think his best days are behind him. Still, he's a funny guy and I'd like to see him get at least one more win. He's good at restrictor-plate racing.|`|VQHGqYXvaa	I like Mikey but he should  give it up!!|`|TkWmFshkaa	Wow, that would be disappointing if he retires.  :-(|`|YPQTXOQ5aa	I think that he is looking ahead to just being an owner. He is starting to realize that you can't do both in a successful manner in today's world. He wants to build his team into a Hendrick or a RCR. Just my thought.

cczy8FfEaa	Depends really, seeing how there is no universal agility training. What exactly are you trying to get quicker at? Total body movement, boxing, grappling, running?    Edit 2/05: If it is for basketball all you need is a couple of agility cones (or cones of any kind) and find some bleachers. You don't have to do that many drills to get a workout just a few, like 3 to 5 per workout and for about the same amount of days. I suggest for 5 days a week to really get the repetition in.        Start out with this cone exercise ( http://www.topendsports.com/testing/imag... ) for 3 sets. I would recommend a stopwatch so you can evaluate yourself and know where to improve. For the 2nd workout, look for some bleachers. Time your self for 30 seconds, and jump on top of one set, then jump back down. Keep doing that as fast as you can till time runs out with 10 second breaks in between for 3 sets. This will help not only your agility but also your jump. Then for a 3rd set do this cone workout ( http://www.topendsports.com/testing/imag... ) with the same amount of sets as the other cone workout.      Hopefully this will aid you in your overall agility for basketball.

9THtgkKlaa	I would say that you are probably holding your stick too tight.  I would also look at the gloves that you are wearing.  If they are worn, try getting new gloves.  Some gloves have added padding in them, see if you can find a pair that have extra padding in the areas you are getting bruises.  If not, you could try wearing a thin pair of winter gloves under your hockey gloves, just for some added cushion.  That will make your hands really hot though.  But definitely look into loosening your grip.  I used to have the same problem.  I would hold my stick so tight that my hands would be black and blue after playing, but I started trying to loosen my grip.  And I am now proud to say I am bruise free...it could just be that you are new to playing hockey and your hands are not used to that type of exercise.  If that's the case, give it some time, and maybe your hands will get used to it.

04c8fcea0e0c4fe4475bd87dad1d78d3aa	Agreed, let the boat do the work for you.  Try to keep your knees bent until you are up.  The board will turn itself towards the boat.  Also, make sure that you do not let your arms extend all the way out...doing so will jerk you face down.  Once you are up and the board has turned put your weight on your back leg.      Other things.  Have the driver try different speeds to get you up.  Sometimes beginners need a slower steady pull, others need to be jerked up (don't let jerked up come across as bad) to get going.    Lastly, since you are beginning, you are most likely using someone else's board.  If you still can't get up try a different board.  Most online stores can tell you what size board you should be riding.  For most of us our boards are too aggressive for a new rider.    I know this is a lot of info, but remember, wakeboarding is ten times easier than skiing and about 1000 times cooler!    Good Luck|`|78GAeOeuaa	keep your knees bent and wait for the boat to acctually pop you out of the water before you stand up. still keep your kees bent and shift your weight to your back foot and you should be up in no time. im not the best wakeboarder but i can do a 180.|`|AxeOdUFQaa	dont stand up right away, let the boat pull you up. lean back but not too far. when ur out of the water wait like half a second and tehn turn the board to wich ever way u feel more comfortable with. idkif that will help i just do it automaticalyy when i board.
yV7NCfOgaa	Make sure you take the 3 step approach and time it right, ( dont jump too soon)   as for snapping the wrist, practice near a wall hitting the ball on the ground ( do it about 50 times ) then go to the court|`|xXO2kEwCaa	well before any game or practice, hit against the wall repeatedly, so you can get the hang of snapping. i also had this problem, but not anymore i hit strait down. and just always think to snap while you are doing your approach. also you can do your approach and snap without a ball just to get used to it.|`|VEScnfoHaa	Don't focus on snapping your wrist as much as you should be focusing on a firm hand. Make sure whenever you come in contact with the ball that you keep your hand flat and firm. It's just like every time I overhand serve or spike: I remind myself of the important and crucial concept of keeping my hand firm.|`|PJQ1Nm1Oaa	Make sure you are in an open space for this.  Toss the ball high into the air in front of you.  Time the ball right, take your approach, and hit the ball down to the ground.  Make sure you hit the ball in front of you and sort of make a "V" with your body, you should tighten your stomach muscles when you do this.  Almost like doing a crunch in the air with your body.    Also when hitting, make sure that you are hitting the ball in front of you.  You should not be under or in front of the ball.|`|GFEhJYAAaa	all i can say is just like hit the ball up against the wall and hit it down and practice snapping your wrist on the wall. it will help and also make sure you have your aproach down really good and the timing will eventually come with that.|`|kdgNIaoiaa	don't just work on snapping your wrist. I find that bending my hitting elbow before i hit the ball works. so when you're in the air it's like your posing. your right arm is straight aiming at the ball, while your left arm is bent, getting ready to hit at a fast speed. one you get into contact with ball that's when you should snap your wrist. oh, and have your hand OVER the ball, not behind it. :]|`|Jsvz996Baa	i have that same problem im left handed too my coach told me to work on the footwork that helped a lot better.|`|e7br8pIfaa	As a younger player, I had a coach who'd drill us constantly on our spikes so that we'd snap our wrists. One exercise he used involved about 5 tennis balls or rolled up socks, and a regulation sized net to work on the technique. With the ball or sock in hand, we'd go through our spiking motion and release the sock or ball by snapping our wrist at the peak of the spike (or the location where you should hit the ball) in order to hit it off the court. By doing this exercise for about 10 minutes per day, I developed a consistency and snapping my wrist became second nature.    Hints:  1) Make sure you're keeping the ball in fron of you on your hitting motion. If you're outrunning the ball, then you'll be reaching your arm back and making contact on the side of the ball rather than the top. When you usually reach back, a line drive is usually what results.    2) Don't forget to swing both your arms on your approach in order to gather more energy for your jump and spike.

I also think you should pick up ANOTHER Point Guard because A.I. doesn't really get that many assists and you need more assists by the look of your team.|`|EX8FOnVpaa	trade boozer and jamison for an elite big man..|`|LVDoQ1Kaaa	thats a pretty good line up but benching him was the right thing to do
KDOIKIq2aa	While all Glock kinda look the same each model has it's own specs.  The Glock 19 has a shorter slide & barrel at 4" than the Glock 17 which has a 4 1/2" barrel.  The Glock 17 has a standard magazine of 17rds while the 19 only has 15 rounds  Both are chambered for the 9mm cartridge.  There was even a Glock 17L a long slide/long barrel Glock target pistol.    The Glock 20 & 21 are bigger than the Glock 17.  This two are chambered for the 10mm & .45 ACP cartridges respective.      The Glock 22 & 23 are like the 17 & 19 but chambered for the .40 S&W cartridge.  Almost identical to them are the Glock 31 & Glock 32 chambered in .357 Sig.    Then they go into the sub compacts with barrels only 3 1/2" long.  They include the Glock 26 in 9mm ,Glock 27 in .40 S&W and the Glock 33 in .357 Sig.  While the large frame sub compact have a barrel length of 3.6" and are  Glock 29 in 10mm & the Glock 30 in .45 ACP.    The Glock 36 is the small slime side .45 ACP model.    Glock also came out with there own cartridge .45 GAP and chambered three Glock handguns for this the full size Glock 37, the compact Glock 38 and the sub compact Glock 39.    There was even a Glock 18 made.  It was a selcet fire machine pistol that could be fired semi automatic or full automatic.  This looked much like the Glock 17 but had a selector switch on the right side of the slide.  It like the Glock 17 was chambered for the 9mm.|`|THvXrJYxaa	No. The two you named are both 9mm. The 17 is the full size and the 19 is the compact model. These two do not have the same dimensions. The 19 is about 1/2 an inch smaller than the 17.     Glock uses the same basic design on all of their guns, so they will look the same if they are in the size category. The 17, 22, 20, 31, & 37 are going to look the same because they are all the full size versions, just a different caliber. But the Glock 26 (9mm) is a lot smaller than the 17 because it is the sub-compact version.|`|KMASS2Gmaa	In my opinion all Glocks are the same, they are all trash.|`|0cLj35Fgaa	Actually, what you said is incorrect.  The glock 17 and 19 are different.  The glock 17 is the standard sized 9mm glock.  The glock 19 is a compact version of the glock 17.  It has a shorter barrel and smaller mag capacity.  The two models that you listed (17 and 19) both shoot 9mm rounds.  There are other pistols made by glock that shoot different calibers.  Check out the glock website.  The link is below.
MjPd9vyYaa	Don't tell us go complain to Y!A.|`|o7gV56ngaa	Send an e-mail to yahoo answers and ask them. But i think you will find that most of the football (soccer) world are not interested in MLS. Let's face it any professional league that plays games on a field with American gridiron markings on it can't be taken too seriously, and there is no promotion and relegation system. That makes it very boring for us football lovers who are used to a system that sends the weaker teams to a lower division and promotes the stronger teams to a stronger division.

DOB4tbquaa	For areas that are going be in mountain country covered by snow, you might dress like a snowmobiler. Snow pants, wool socks, layers of clothing, warm hat and thermo gloves. Insulated snow boots keep your feet warm. It is important to avoid cotton clothing, which once it gets wet you'll lose all your body heat. It is important to have good sunglasses or you'll get snow blindness. If you are going in snow country; bring a pair of snowshoes & poles. Also, a small snow shovel.  You might even consider an avalanche beacon.    In warmer climates, you might want to dress lighter for more mobility.  Make sure you stay dry. You might use your hiking shoes if they have good traction on sandstone and mud. It might be good to bring a good pair of hiking poles, to keep you from slipping. If you use regular hiking boots you may need to double up wickdry or wool socks. A wickdry base layer, will keep you dryer from you sweat.    A wet down jacket loses body heat. A good coat made with a wool liner will keep you warmer.|`|yvpfphQNaa	There are two common materials for synthetic base layers (the layer worn next to the skin).  The most common is polyester. Whilst this may bring to mind horrible cheap workshirts from the 80s, it's actually a really good material. The fabric is hydrophillic, meaning that is absorbs all the moisture from your body, and spreads it out as far as possible, allowing it to evaporate much more easily. This obviously makes it much more comfortable, and will cool you down better (due to the evaporative cooling). Another interesting thing, compared to cotton, is that it doesn't seem to absorb sunlight in quite the same way - a black cotton tshirt gets roasting in hot sunlight, but a black polyester top doesn't...  The next material is polypropylene. This is less common - in fact I've only seen Helly Hansen make them. This is a hydrophobic material, and so once the moisture from your body comes into contact with it, it pushes the moisture straight out into the next layer. This means it is quite good for a layered clothing system - if you have a microfleece (i.e. synthetic fleece, not sheep's fleece or so) over the top, but less effective on its one.    For non-synthetic base layers, we have merino wool, a classic make of which is Icebreaker. The main advantages to me of this over synthetic are the fact that it stays warm when wet (obviously sheep need to be warm when wet), and that it gets less smelly than a synthetic (which do get very smelly). However, I personally find that whilst they advertise that none of their products retain any smell whatsoever, I find that the heavier garments do smell when they get wet, but really strangely, doesn't smell of me, but a different smell, still unpleasant though, odd. These are more heavy, but they are a lot warmer than synthetic.    In terms of fit/cut, for a layered system it is good to have your base layer tight and close to the skin. This is so it can work effectively at transferring moisture.   For a non-layered system, i.e. in summer when it's pretty hot, I find that a much looser fit is preferable. This means you just wear the one loose tshirt. The synthetic versions of these are marketed more as 'sports shirts', for running etc. These can be picked up cheaply in sports shops, (like JD or JJB sport if you live in england, but i'm sure you'll have similar things wherever you are), whereas the outdoors stores tend to sell them a lot more expensively. The Icebreaker superfine 140 is what i wear for non-synthetic in this kind of thing.     Hope this helps!|`|Mv1F4Ooyaa	You should be wearing materials that wick sweat away from your skin. Usually they're made from synthetic materials. The reason being that they're made from plastic, which is made from oil. And we all know that oil and water don't mix. The materials usually are less porous than say cotton on a fiber level and so water will actually evaporate off them from the heat of your body.    If you're thinking of taking up hiking you'd be as well to get yourself some decent gear. A pair of boots and a decent waterproof jacket anyway. Underneat any synthetic material clothes will suit your purpose. Polyester, nylong, anything that says poly at the start is synthetic and will do the job, spandex even.     If it's cold I'd put on a few tee shirts underneat a polyester jumper. If it warms up a bit I can take off the jumper. If it gets colder usually putting on my jacket will keep me warm enough while I'm moving. Although it's always a good idea to carry an extra jumper in your bag.    Hope I didn't stray off topic too much, and helped. Good luck in your future hikes.|`|c205d2af3c68e3ac29f18413bf92ebcbaa	http://www.underarmour.com/shop/us/en/ne...|`|JYLiva1Naa	go to Walmart and get the polyester shirts for about $9, they are in the mens section, they are actually recycled fiber but are light and dry very quick, I carry at least 2 extra, also the shorts are made of the same stuff, you can wash them but let them hang dry. The name brand is "Athletic Works" They wick the moisture away from your body, also get a pair of "Under Armor" or "Medalist" underwear, made of nylon. These might cost  alittle more but are well worth it. (they keep the sweat rashes away).|`|BpChBQBQaa	Yup, cotton is bad.  Its because it is such a good conductor of heat when wet.    Generally, good base layers like the one mentioned by the person above, or my personal favourite is Merino Wool.  Ever so slightly more heavier but worth it.    Once I'm walking and generating heat (and as long as its not pissing it down and ridiculously cold) I will probably strip to the base layers.  Whenever I stop I religously put on another layer (fleece, coat or both) just to maintain and keep as constant my body heat as I can.    If its more summer conditions (ie not arctic) I'll have lightweight "spit-proof" waterproofs.  I concede to fact I'll probably get wet from rain or my sweat - or both, but as long as I can keep the wind off then the layers I have underneath really count.  It all about trapping that heat.

mRvZq0VZaa	I'd get smaller skis.  Something around 163cm.  You want skis to come to about your forehead or perhaps slightly shorter if you're a beginner.  Its less weight and length for your body to maneuver.    Check this website out:  http://www.evogear.com/info/helpcenter/1...|`|OrG2fBbKaa	That is a real good price, but they are too long for your height and ability, also the boots may not fit your foot as they should. Keep looking, there are lots of good deals  just waiting for you.  Go to a ski shop and try on different pairs of boots, when you find a pair that fit properly, grab them, add foot beds and get checked for cants and delta (ramp) that suits you the best.  Boots are the critical piece of equipment.|`|DhEZj9cKaa	Need to get shorter skis,  and remember you get what you pay for.|`|HkwUGOmxaa	it would work but the other person is right...better shorter. good price tho. Really more importantly is your weight. If you are average or lighter...probably dont want to do it. The ski is newer and will still turn easily. If your weight is above average they will do fine. This will offset the length a bit. And you can always use them for awhile and sell them if they don't work out. Just remember to go in and pay to get the bindings adjusted and safety checke for your ability, height, weight, and age. very important.

AV4CYfGDaa	You do have enough information. I won't solve it, but here's a hint:    The ball was thrown at 25 m/s, and it traveled 50 m. How many seconds would that take. (Another Hint: 2 seconds).    It will travel the same vertical distance in the same amount of time whether you drop it throw it. You just need to find out how far a ball will fall in 2 seconds if you drop it.|`|sBrummATaa	wow thats confusing. im sorry, i cant answer that|`|wYGeg0QRaa	You haven't been given enough information to solve this problem. That's why you can't come up with the proper equation. You aren't stupid the question is. It's like asking " a man is running 7mph how long will it take him to get there?"
QTYBJwzTaa	How about the G.O.A.T doing a Freddie Spencer MotoGP and Moto2 Champion in the same year.     After all it would be safer than closing the curtains. How fast were they going when he crashed?    Can't see it happening but as Girl Racer says expect the unexpected.    ZZoli, I must have been sleeping the year MotoGP raced 1400's, were they fast?|`|vqZ2XLf6aa	i wou;dn't be that suprised if he did. He's mentioed several times about just doing two more seasons in MotoGP and then moving on, maybe to rallys or maybe WSB, but in two years the Moto2 will be on the go so he could easily go there, which would do wonders for the credibility and popularity of the new class. It'd be the best possible stamp of approval and promotion they could ever have by having Vale ride in the first season or two. Then he could move over to Rallying and win everything there.    I like the idea of him doing a Freddie Spencer but i suppose that'd dependa lot on Yamaha runnign equivalent bikes in both classes. But with Vale anything could happen.|`|KCtdICMTaa	[ yes it would be like Valentino to want to be the first champion in the new  600 class, i think firsts and lasts are what he likes...did you hear about him falling through a glass top table, while closing the curtains and needing stitches to his hand and foot,.... or did i dream that....|`|lFqUMMAGaa	I do not feel Valentino Rossi would take a step back to the 600's ~  MotoGP rocks I can't wait till it starts, I really missed it during the winter ~|`|QLMW7HRMaa	With Rossi any thing is possable in racing.  The man loves to race.  But, backing down to a slower class is doubtful.      He didn't lower the power of bikes,  everyone else did.|`|LDVEzHsvaa	Yeah, I think he might.    Why not.    He could win another title on MotoGP, then jump to WSB. Win that in his first year, then once the Moto2 class is all set up, have a go with that.    That would be 6 different class world titles along.    He might as well. He would have nothing to loose by doing it.|`|IuwVj2kGaa	Hi Proc  I don'tthink so.  If he has considered WSBK is because MotoGP is risking his status as the world top Motorcycle Racing Category, and to race Troy as a personal challenge    Valentino wants and should race only where the best bikes and riders are.|`|CoHl61Hjaa	You see - the thing is with Vale - not only is he THE World's Greatest Motorcycle Racer - he's also an unpredictable one too !!    There are no impossibities for Valentino - expect the unexpected !!!!    (LOL) He DOES talk a lot too ! - Hardly surprising when you think how many people actually want to listen to such a Genius Legend !    It's a GooD JoB everything that he does have to say - IS backed up once on the track !! He could, otherwise end up sounding like a bit of a KNOB really - would you not agree CHRISTINA ? - (I'm sure your Dad will anyway) !!     AND talking of KNOB's - I do believe we've found the ultimate here in Mr. ZZOli - What a fine introduction you make of yourself dear !!    Mr. Rossi is a born racer AND not just for financial purposes -  There's the fun and challenging aspects too -    I think that he'd be just as happy to participate in any race - regardless of vehicle, class or speed - if that's where the racing competition is - that's where Rossi's gonna be !!!|`|N4RpY9vAaa	My dad met him apparently he talks alot..|`|mKmrfeX7aa	Moto Gp is like F1 and the bikes have 1400cc engines so i don't think his interested in something so slow.|`|ecff03abdcf3608faea8684f22766561aa	Hi Proc    Part of me says no, he wouldn't do that. But another part also thinks that the Motogp2 series might take over as the premier class.      With the 800's disappearing up their own hoop (in my opinion), the 600's look like quite an interesting alternative. I just hope some of the more obscure engine manufacturers get involved, like Ilmore & Rotax. That will keep the Flammini brothers happier.    It would be great to see different combinations of engine and chassis. Like Rotax/Spondon, Ilmore/Harris, Bimota/Proton (any combination)    If that happens, then it's a distinct possibility.|`|jsn4gBpPaa	i rekon we might see the great valentino into other forms of sport soon maybe rally cars or formula 1 as he has been testing things like this
9hC7bbf7aa	Absolutely delighted to know Serena has elevated tennis another notch above golf !! More than Anika Sorenson has earned in her career !!  Good news for the both, male and female tennis to be recognized definitely at the same level as golf,basket ball and football, It's about time tennis will not be shadowed by other notorious sports anymore !|`|UZBULUuraa	Women's tennis is exciting and they have a large following and the winner deserves a good pay check, but I have a problem with women playing no more than 3 sets and the men playing 5 sets. Serena nor Safina deserved to be in the final. Cornet got a bad call on match point against Safina and Azarenka had the flu and still beat Serena in the first set before almost collapsing and having to retire.|`|bXGwTQy6aa	yea,its great...but what is your question?|`|o2WdAKZbaa	It's very cool in so many ways. First off it's Serena, secondly it's an American women and lastly she's a tennis player. I don't care what anyone says but the Williams sisters definitely are responsible for bringing the women's game to the next level. Serena has regained the  1 ranking 7 years after first achieving it in 2001. That is remarkable in it's own right. And, I don't understand those haters that can't give credit where credits do. Who cares if you don't like her style, looks or attitude but you cannot deny that she is a great competitor and good for women's tennis.|`|3jBUJxOdaa	I thought it would be in golf. Thanks for enlightening|`|ezxKSt5xaa	I like Serena but i am tired of seeing her winning. Its about time someone else gets into the spotlight|`|sfHLcFaAaa	yes shame she such a fat *****.|`|Y31Ci8vlaa	It is great to know that a female athlete who won the highest prize is from tennis.It is more greater to know that it is serena williams.Her performances and consistency took her to the top level in the sport and she has already earned a legendary position in tennis.

AA11345264	3 things    1. A lot of times certain players get or don't get calls based on the record they build for themselves over a period of time. For example, 9 times out of 10 (a healthy) D Howard can flat out jump over people so he won't really get called for going over people's backs, or Bruce Bowen having built a record for being a superior defender gets the benefit of the doubt on a lot of the contact that takes place when he is gaurding someone. On the other side of it Rasheed Wallace has built of record saying/doing things to get technical fouls, so now since that is the pattern he has established for himself it doesn't take much for refs to hit him with a technical on actions they may let Lebron or Wade slide on. So your record/reputation has a lot to do with it.    2. And then of course it is a business so the ref that calls traveling on Lebron James when he is on a one on none fastbreak on a nationally televised game in Madison Square Garden will be working high school games next year. So yeah thats a big part of it too.     3. and then the refs are just humans too, so they miss things, might get personal with players or at time might just be in awe of the action and get caught up being a fan for a couple seconds. Or all of the above.|`|30315581daf78d6b64ddc75c02034e03aa	First things first.  The great NBA players who slash to the basket (Kobe, James, Wade, etc.) do not travel that often.  Everyone in the world has this idea that NBA players travel all the time and they don't know how to dribble.  Its actually the exact opposite.  They are so good at dribbling in fact that they know how to bend the rules and manipulate things.  They know the last second they can pick up their dribble to cover extra distance, they take two extralong strides (which is allowed), and then hang in the air for seemingly impossible amounts of time, tuck their legs in to hit the ground later and then get rid of the ball a slpit second before they hit the ground.  Of course there are times when they do travel, but its just gotten to the point where the players have found many more ways of covering ground and other little things they can do to create an advantage.|`|af60dec109a9a6738c2da98d50036aefaa	They always call peoples names out, but you just can't hear it and the commentator sometime doesn't say it. I am saying that because you will see a few people or just one person come to the ref when he blows his whistle.|`|AA10671557	most refs are reluctant to throw out a star necause of theyre influence over the crowd and over the rest of the team  the ref does care about his popularity; if he chucks out a star or any popular player hes not gonna have alot of love from the crowd  and if that happens, hes under a lot of heat when the NBA investigates, because they love to so that way it can get to the headlines  and yes, they do watch  and if they dont, then their shitty refs  most do, which is why Wade has problems with his turnovers, just like almost any other star because they hold the ball so much more than a role player  and when physical cheap contact happens, the crowd will give the signal as to what happened, and usually the refs just give a late call  and if the refs dont call, the players will let them know  and in case of an altercation, stars dont take the bigger heat because of that stated above, and because theyre the team leaders and can take the refs.  Look at the Ray Allen-Kenyon Dooling altercation  Kenyon Doolings pullin Allens jersey, and then catches him accross the face with an elbow AND pushes him down and then drains a three  afterwards, Allen tackles Dooling and starts punching him  and then both are ejected, Allen takes a one game suspension, Dooling three, because the NBA doesnt want a big fuss over it, just a news story to sell give to the press|`|8227dae7f63f5d5e354932ac84d6e915aa	because if they make a faule they have to stop playing if they get a more then one pont|`|AA11475307	Because of a player's media image. Refs are pretty gullible and will go along with whatever's written in the papers or what's being talked about on TV.     The likes of Wayne Rooney and Duncan Ferguson get sent off all the time because of their media image, yet Alan Shearer was a fouling b'stard and always got away with it. Why? Because he was a Mr Clean family man in the eyes of the media.|`|361858e3b7f21a517622c6ce0b2d170baa	Those guys have earned there right to travel.|`|f19d7226d9ea6c069c396a48d8a9283daa	For the same reason they never called anything on MJ all those years: favoritism and star power.     And travelling, in general, is never called in the NBA.|`|AA10120499	they dont wanna be hated

Joe is retiring at his peak and I am sure all his supporters will wish him well in his retirement.|`|daad940e9bc0b3b1281557caf3a3f195aa	I think Joe feels that he's accomplished all he wanted to in boxing and that there's nothing left to prove. Sure a Dawson fight would've been nice but there's always going to be someone out there that everyone feels he should fight so when is he supposed to retire? If he beats Dawson then retires after that then people are going to say, "See, he retired cause he's ducking Carl Froch" so it's really a no-win situation for him.    I think Calzaghe was a good fighter and I wish him well in his decision. He beat Hopkins and Jones (albeit past their primes), beat two young and unbeaten Super Middleweights in Jeff Lacy and Mikkel Kessler when he was the underdog in BOTH fights, and he was champ for over 10 years. Joe was a tough SOB who would've gave any fighter fits. I respect him and wish him the best.|`|EuxU8J7Raa	I don't believe Joe fears, who?  Chad Dawson????     Yes! Joe is quite right to be thinking about retirement because being at the top of your profession is definitely the best way to bow out.|`|eTspmrjMaa	lol Chad Dawson? No he has been running from Carl Froch for the last four years and he knows now that Froch is WBC super middleweight world champion that he can no longer ignore his calls. You know the WBC belt that Joe had that he wouldn't defend because he knew that he would end up losing his undefeated status to Carl Froch if he did? There are some people in life that you know you will just not beat and so you avoid for fighters that you know you have a good chance against and that was always Calzaghes style. I had been waiting for him to fight Carl Froch ever since Carl started saying that he would hammer Calzaghe to pieces after only his 15th fight. Joe refused on every occasion. Luckily for him or else right now he would be asking for a rematch with Froch to set the record straight instead of retiring undefeated.|`|J1w0Ewy0aa	Joe fears Chad Dawson but not Bernard Hopkins? Really?|`|vDvxaevcaa	Do I read it right from shaker, 5m euro dollar for a fight? That is around 8m us dollar. 5m us dollar short for a purse on Pacquiao v Hatton fight. And people think Joe is a great fighter and yet not too much for a price.|`|gnj5Wublaa	1997-2008 as a world champion, you don't do that if you're a bum.   46-0, you don't do that either if you're a bum. He was an outstanding amateur also.   I don't think hes scared of Dawson. He fought 2 younger guys(Lacey,Kessler) before who many expected to blow him away. He didnt dodge them & beat them both convincingly.  Where does this notion of him beating Roy Jones jr is akin to him beating an old man? Theres only 3 years between them both.|`|AA12158527	What you say is utter bo***cks. If Joe beat a peak Tyson with one hand you  would  still be a HATER.  Chad Dawson???  Who is he?The next Sugar Ray Robinson?|`|3M6wRYAoaa	46-0 all you haters cant take that away from jc so you try to tarnish his record by playing down his opponents. when ever us welsh people get something good the english have to pick faults with it i hope carl froch fights kessler soon i want to see his career over before it has chance to start kessler would take his head clean off his shoulders|`|3p6Nm8AXaa	i'm sorry but was lacy over the hill ?|`|kBScgrVMaa	Open your eyes' post was spot on.     Carl Froch is the reason Calzaghe is retiring. NO WAY would anyone turn down 5m, if it were so easy to win the fight.     Calzaghe will have HUGE question marks hanging over his record and his legacy. His record is full of bums, unknowns, reality tv stars and old men who were 7 years past their best!     Go Joe, I doubt anyone will miss you!

DOVbF4Piaa	Visit a few of the local bike shops and see what they have.  You can ride a hybrid off road on rail trails and smooth path ways and it will be liter and faster then a mountain bike.  They also make a comfort/pathway bike with 26 inch tires that will be just a little better on the paths but a little slower on the road.  Another option is a cyclo-cross bike, but they cost as much as a road bike.|`|aQcsrgLCaa	If you didn't make use of your mountain bike, it seems a waste to buy a bike that is suitable for off road use. To me an hybrid bike is a very poor compromise. They are only good for light off road use and are not that good on the road.    The other option is to buy a good, inexpensive road bike.    I'm not local to Devon, but try the Edinburg bicycle co-op website, Evans, or Wiggle. They will all offer fair quality road, off road and mountain bikes.     I now use a home built, single speed, aluminium framed cyclo cross bike for lanes and bridleways in my area and find it much lighter, faster and just as comfortable as my dual suspension mountain bike that is a bit 'over the top' for the area that I regularly ride.|`|O0MR5dUaaa	RidgeBack - prefreably specialized.|`|bAKiEh3Laa	Get a fugi police bike.   there awesoome and it looks like a good overall bike. also nobodys going to want to steel your bike with a police paintjob.

7pUPu7fMaa	Dyno is a make of mountain bike.    Note that 'spelt' is a perfectly correct past participle of 'to spell.'    Two other possibilities you could be getting at:    'Dyno' is also a contraction of 'dynamometer,' a device for measuring revolutions per minute.    More likely, you are referring to a 'dynamo,' which is a type of electrical generator, generally used to power lights on bicycles.    Certainly. A dynamo is like a motor, only it works in reverse. Rather than converting electrical energy into rotational kinetic energy (as a motor does), it converts rotational kinetic energy into electrical energy, which can then be used to, for example, power a bike's lights. Inside a small (e.g. - bike's) dynamo, one or more coils of wire turn within a fixed magnetic field. This motion induces electrical current(s) to flow within the coil(s) in accordance with Faraday's Law. A device called a comutator is used to ensure that the resulting direction of current flow from the output of the dynamo is always the same, such that it produces what is called direct current (DC) rather than alternating current (AC) as most generators, such as those used in power stations, do.    Exactly right. If you see an old man on a bike struggling to pedal with the light going brighter and dimmer, it's probably got dynamo-driven lights.|`|Cl6KbcAGaa	The only thing you spelled wrong is "spelt"....see previous answer!|`|aQcsrgLCaa	Surely a tachometer measures revolutions.    Don't forget zenner diodes for allowing power to be used for storage in a stand light system.    As a matter of interest, I prefer hub dynamos rather than the bottle type and I only run with a dynamo front light (with stand light) and a 3watt bulb rather than the standard 2.4watt in conjunction with a rear dynamo light.

Celtic having more fans than any other scottish team could be part of it but who knows.    Bluebell everyone knows whos fans are worst behaved so this means nothing..yous are the ones with the reputation as right wing louts    BikerBear the facts are that rangers fans have a reputation for misbehaving. Just ask the fans of barcelona, celta vigo, zenit (lol), residents of Manchester etc etc    yeah, I know Bluebell, its just that Rangers have a higher percentage than most teams|`|c97e18e356f8c6c65740d12fc018416baa	Manchester !|`|3uxSproCaa	Cos theres millions and millions of us, is probably a fair ratio lol.    God I wish I had the free time you obviously have. Am sure someone somewhere cares.|`|AA11594429	I don't know how banning orders are dished out, if the club is involved in reporting/identifying fans or if it's purely a police matter. I'd hope the higher number was due to Celtic taking a tough stance on unacceptable behaviour rather than a higher proportion of idiots. But if it's the later then these so-called fans need to be made examples of for tarnishing the reputations of the rest of us.   Edit- Anyone know the number of arrests in Seville?|`|5b38de0671cf5eb7f5806387aa356806aa	doesn't surprise me it always been the same in this country...arrested, banning orders and on the end of sectarian murders we'll always top the league on all three.tells a story doesn't it the systems corrupt full of bigots top to bottom|`|Q4aGkwGLaa	yer questions are full of hate and just not funny and useless information... crawl back into the cave knuckle dragger|`|23533728e2015c47fbaedd308257bf8aaa	The greatest fans in the world....My fecking erse they are.|`|ePFdhsCYaa	Oh love it.

75ZMWlnnaa	last year at AO, it was nowhere near as hot as it was this year, i live in sydney, but i saw on tv and heard it was in the 40s down at melbourne this year during AO, and to play in those conditions is just physically exhausting. im just glad that none of the players actually died on court.    novak had a much easier draw last year, because lets see, he played an absolutely tired lleyton hewitt in 4th round, against david ferrer in QF- a player djokovic has dominated on HC, a mono-plagued roger federer in SF and then an inexperienced jo-wilfried tsonga in the final...does anything else need to be said???    this year, he came into the AO with a target on his back, the pressure of being a defending champion, and he is not physically fit, nor is he mentally strong, he CHOKED big time against roddick.    djokovic obviously did not train hard enough, roddick was also playing in the same conditions, but he was out there and the heat did not even seem to bother him.    people need to stop thinking that djokovic is on the SAME level as nadal or federer, because he ISNT, he has a VERY long way to go before he can even be put on their level.    he better get his act together really quickly or else he will be in very big danger of having andy murray taking the no.3 ranking off him soon, and personally i dont care much for either player, but i think djokovic is better to watch than that sour bore of a player murray, and also because i think when djokovic plays against nadal and federer, he makes it interesting.|`|NDbx9CSvaa	Well last year, he lost just 1 set in the entire tournament and that too in the finals + evening time. May be if someone pushed him to 4 or 5, he might have struggled.|`|o2WdAKZbaa	I think it was a number of things that made Novak unable to finish the match with Roddick. First, I think Novak isn't as physically fit as other top ten players and that showed in the extreme heat. He also had a couple four set matches that were pretty draining on him and he just wore himself down. I also don't think he re-hydrated himself after each match properly and paid the price. This should be a big lesson for him in the years to come. He's got to commit to getting stronger if he ever wants to be the best player.|`|U7BkuEU9aa	I KNOW!!!!! That was exactly my point when he forfeited...he was well aware of the severe conditions having played the tournament before (and, what's worse, WON - meaning he stayed there and played in those conditions for the entire two weeks in '08 without complaining).    What really happened was that he saw he was gonna lose to Andy and just gave up, and it wasn't the first time - it's like it's his "thing". It's what he does. I don't know how so many people like that pathetic excuse of a clown.|`|N9KhTEKCaa	i really wanted him to win and see him against murray but i guess... this year was way hotter =[|`|RC3WoqFkaa	it was hotter this year.|`|s4wHrUB3aa	novak probably faked it cuz hes a whiner and cant admit he would have lost if he continued|`|tc8nbxmyaa	looove djokovic, but hes one over confident bastard. roddick was just too good this time. Im sure he thought that since he won the first set, he would easily win the next two. i dont think he has what it takes to measure up to nadal or federer|`|u3FqxhY8aa	Because the temperatures were much more different this year than last, Australia was facing some of the worst temperatures it has had to deal with in a century.  http://australian.open-tennis.com/news/m...  http://theprofessionalhobo.com/2009/01/l...  and aren't you a bit late in asking these kinds of questions, people realized how difficult it would really be to do since no amount of training could truly prepare you for that, plus he had to deal with a very late night match in which Roddick even stood up for him|`|RQBolYlXaa	cos last year i was not as hot, temperatures in australia r at its highest since the 1920's and they r in the middle of a heat wave, it was that hot over there that there was even wide spread fires

When JMFJ comes back from injury Kings might have enough to grap a playoff spot.|`|LEQowzHCaa	Steve Mason    He's been a revelation, providing the Columbus Blue Jackets with stellar goaltending numbers as the team tries to make the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time.    1. He's a Quick Learner     Mason started the year recovering from knee surgery, causing him to miss the first month of action.    After a short stint with the Syracuse Crunch, he was called up to the big show when an injury caused Blue Jackets starter Pascal Leclaire to be placed on IR.     Mason flew out of the gate like a superstar, winning his first three starts and six of his first nine, giving Columbus a new hope. He's playing as if he's been in the league for years, and he quickly nailed down the starting job, even after Leclaire returned.         2. His Resume Is Loaded    Now roughly halfway through the season, Mason is leading the NHL in GAA (1.80), save-percentage (.936), and shutouts (6). He had a streak of three straight shutouts in late December, and he's now won seven of his last nine games.    He's leading other top league netminders such as Roberto Luongo, Niklas Backstrom, and Tim Thomas, so why couldn't this guy make a case for the Vezina if his strong play continues?     He already has a gold medal and MVP honors from the 2008 World Junior Championships and OHL goaltender of the year for '06-07, and now he has his sights on the Calder Trophy.         3. He's Re-Shaping Columbus    It's no secret that the Blue Jackets haven't exactly been a powerhouse since entering the league in 2000. They've yet to reach the postseason, and have yet to have a winning season, coming as close as 34-36-12 in '07-08.     Columbus is currently 21-18-4, third in the central division, and eighth in the Western conference. With the strong play of their rookie netminder, they are in line to play playoff hockey for the first time.    Of course, you can't give all the credit to Mason; the Blue Jackets do have a nice supporting cast to Rick Nash this year. But Mason is certainly doing his part to contribute to Columbus' success.          4. He's a Giant Killer    Nothing like a David and Goliath reference to add some spice to a young athlete's game.|`|lEiwSBHEaa	andy sutton.  i dont care if hes on the worst team in the nhl  hes hott = )

aPDZzT9taa	depends on if their 2-stroke or 4-stroke but 180cc is bigger engine|`|k6Sbm9qCaa	honda|`|vC6FedRqaa	Pulsar is a major hit in the market and you know that it comes in four variants    Looks and Styling: Bajaj Pulsar 180cc is elegant in its looks with aerodynamic shape. It has a flush-fitted tail lamp and thank GOD no tail lamp protuberances. The bike has an LCD speedo and tachometer console. Its the fuel tank of Pulsar 180cc that gives the muscular shaped body to it. . The tank of Pulsar extends downwards touching the engine head almost.     The black styling provides the bike a sleek as well as subtle aggression. It has a scanty dashboard layout and has a lighter yet stronger alloy wheels that call for low maintenance, as it wouldnt rust. Switches are convenient for use and there is a tacho; a beam flasher. The posture of Bajaj Pulsar 180cc is so flexible and the bike has a proportionate blend of style and functionality. On the whole, the bike is good in its looks, feel, handling as well as mileage.    Performance: Bajaj Pulsar DTSi has a throttle-actuated ignition control system that works together with a chip-controlled digital capacitor discharge ignition system and this gives accurate ignition time under any condition that in turn optimizes the load-bearing capacity of the engine. The dual-spark design accelerates and evens out flame propagation resulting in more efficient combustion and thereby resulting in a greater performance. The newly designed exhaust complies with the EURO 2005 norms. The 180cc engine of Pulsar delivers maximum power of 16.5bhp @ 8000 rpm and a torque of 15.22Nm @6000 rpm. ExhausTEC technology improves torque of the engine. The engine is powered to carry higher loads.    The stronger alloy wheel coupled with a long wheelbase of 1330mm enhances the stability of the bike and also makes it more agile. One can sit with ease on the bike. Shock absorption is quite good and vibrations are reduced to minimum. The engine is improved with a stable chassis, a new design magnesium alloy wheel and Nitrox shock absorbers, rear suspension with triple-rated springs are some noteworthy features of Pulsar 180cc.    The Nitrox or nitrogen-assisted rear gas shock absorber and the triple-rated springs are meant to handle extreme road conditions and terrain. The pillion seating is comfortable and the bike provides a mileage of about 45-50kmpl.    The fuel efficiency is decent if not astounding running 45-50 km per every liter of fuel. The acceleration of this bike is excellent and linear and enough power on all the gears. The gearing for the first two gears is short that enables the bike for fast changes and good acceleration. The clutch system is improved than the older version. The neat silencer routing ensure the minimum number of turns for exhaust gases while the all-chrome upswept silencer is mounted parallel to the rear sub-frame gives a sporty look.    Final Verdict: The Bajaj Pulsar 180 is a package for young brigade and is a powerhouse with sensational 125kmph top speed. The bike performs well at all speeds and cornering is something commendable. The bike using Digital Twin Technology Ignition (DTSi), Ignition with Digital CDI, Twin Spark Plugs and a third-generation Throttle Responsive Ignition Control System should never let you down as you carry your honey!    Specifications:    Displacement: 179cc  Engine: Air Cooled, 2 Plug  Maximum Power: 16.70ps@8500rpm  Maximum Torque: 15.22nm@6000rpm  Gears: 5 Speed  Weight: 140.00 kg  Fuel Tank: 15.00 ltrs  Wheelbase: 1330.00 mm      Personal opinion ...... hands down I would choose Bajaj..... Or a harley
HkwUGOmxaa	the ex bindings are good. They are made by ride snowboards which is one of the leaders in bindings and technologies. However it is an entry level binding. Price point. It is fine but they make some slightly more expensive and more freestyle desighned bindings that will offer more support without taking away your feel and mobility. If you are stepping up to boxes and jumps it may be time to upgrade. The best time is now because things can be found on sale and then throw off the cost by selling your old product. A binding I would recomend (as I ride Ride products board and binding). Binding- Contraband. One strap for easy on and off incase you are hiking back up to the box again. And for board the DH. Or a less expensive freestyle board is the ride kink. Great too. The avalanche could be fine but what kind? IS  it made for freestyle of is it a freeride? the Ride kink or Dh is designed to not "grab" on rails and boxes or catch an edge (resulting in the quick fall). Your gear will work fine. But try friends stuff or go to free demo days on the mountain to try new gear. You never know what this stuff can do to your learning curve until you try it out. Most importantly is that you are out there doing it. Incourage your friends. Go to ridesnowboards.com. See ya on da slopes!
LIKkt8djaa	avalanche is a low end brand not really designed to Excel at really anything, It sounds like you're into freestyle though so as far as quality brands I would look at.    GNU  libtech  Omatic  Stepchild  Capita  Neversummer  K2  Forum  Rome    Avoid pretty much all the brands sold at those big retail stores "D&icks,sports check,sports authority,big 5 ect ect". Pretty much all the brands sold there "Lamar,LTD,Sims,morrow" are low end garbage decks that any boarder planning to go a lot shouldn't bother buying, They'll only end up holding you back.

I'm not saying skaters don't get dizzy but after alot of practice we learn how to not let us affect our program.|`|ioCVcGDuaa	skaters dont spot.    but after being trained to do so your body just complies.  when spinning especially in competition, the skater is focusing on their position, not nessecarily the world whizzing around them.|`|IsQckOXraa	as a skater myself, i have to say a ton of practice  after awhile spinning just becomes a regular function in you brain  and it doesn't make you dizzy anymore  unless your doing a layback which in that case makes me a little dizzy because you have to look up or to the side.  :)|`|bvnzv923aa	What I do is "spot". It's when every time that you spin around, you look at something. Let's say your parent is in the stands. When you spin, every time you spin around, you focus on them (It doesn't have to be a parent, it could be anything.) Also, over time, you get less and less dizzy. Hope that helped! :)|`|gYbKEQuOaa	To comprimise what was said above, figure skaters - in no way - spot when they spin. I went from dancing to figure skating and was constantly told to quit the spotting habbit. It's actually a matter of pure physics. Skaters shift their center of gravity over the spin foot, leaving the free foot "free" to move in whatever position you want it to. It does take much practice, but once you get the hang of it, it's nothing. The whole getting dizzy just takes getting used to. Eventually you won't feel as dizzy, but i've been skating for 11 years and I still tend to get a little dizzy.|`|VCyY0WOQaa	gravity vortex inducer|`|8qpvfL1kaa	Skaters DO NOT spot while spinning like dancers do. They usually spin much faster on the ice than dancers do on the floor, so spotting isn't so safe. Some skaters might spot for twizzles or other turns, which aren't considered "spins" and are much slower. Eventually you get used to spinning and you don't get dizzy--it just takes practice.|`|OFQoL7H9aa	i don't know how to explain it but....I don't know there is some kind of differance from glidding and walking.

Yeah I heard Magallon is back. He is set to play against Necaxa. And yeah he isn't going to play with Mexico versus the U.S. It sucks because he was only 4 days late. If he played against Monterrey he would of most likely get called up to play for Mexico. Its all good we still got a tight defense. Rafa Marquez, Carlos Salcido, Ricardo Osorio, and Aaron Galindo, so I think our defense will be okay against USNT.
Cl6KbcAGaa	for a single speed I just recommend that you go with a platform pedal for now and later get a toe strap for the pedals. Its a single speed you are going to fly on this thing and you certainly don't need clipless unless you want them...|`|DOVbF4Piaa	Most people that ride fixed gear bikes use clip-less pedals or at the minimum pedals with clips.  If you never rode a fixed gear bike before you don't want to have to worry about clipping in and out on the pedals. You can get a set of Wellgo pedals with straps and remove the straps/clips untill you get use to the bike, they run about $20.|`|ba005dfdcc32139a13ae1e054954f404aa	Its normal for new bikes to come sans pedals.  A good pair of flat pedals is in order.  I have the Sun/Ringle Zu-Zu's on one of my bikes and they are great.|`|aQcsrgLCaa	In my opinion there are two types of pedals for you. The first one is a standard platform pedal and within this genre there are several types. A traditional 'rat trap' type pedal, a B.M.X. type platform or a modern plastic type.    I prefer a S.P.D. type pedal (a shimano 'invention' that uses cleats on the shoe that clip into the pedals). These pedals lock the shoe to the pedal and they are made by several manufacturers and they are (should be) interchangeable with each other.    The cost of the pedals varies with quality and the price includes the cleats. You will however need a pair of suitable shoes to be able to fit  the cleats to the shoes.    They can be a one sided pedal with the mechanism on one side of the pedal and a plain platform pedal on the other side. This means that if you want to nip to the shops, you don't have to put on your special shoes. They are also made with the S.P.D. fitments on both sides.    The good thing about S.P.D. shoes is that they allow the wearer to walk quite normally when off the bike as the cleats are recessed inside the sole of the shoe.    This system allows more power to be  transferred to the bike as the shoes are safely and securely attached to the pedals.|`|dW5bycMTaa	Congratulations!  It looks like a sharp bike.  I'd go with the "rat-trap" type pedals.  No clips or straps, but something your shoes can grip, too.  I commute 10 miles each way to work once the snow clears out, and I like the pedals I have--no straps or clips, just step on it and go.|`|ed1e958a74b3aff1204376a3d8dca2a2aa	looks like a nice bike flat pedals for now you can all ways try clip ins after you get used to your new bike wellgo makes a nice clip in pedal you also will need riding shoes that clip into the pedals|`|AA11603594	BikeBling.com sells the EASTON Flat Boys platforms for $80.

f24ewRzqaa	i dont think size has anything to do with it. You dont need to be tall or big to be a fullback. The things you really need to be a good full back is to be able to communicate to your other players while you are at the back in your position, you need to be fast, you need to be able to catch any type of ball these being bombs grubbers or whatever, being able to return the ball. If you work on these skills you will make the perfect fullback|`|X4U36dHzaa	you sound like your tall enough,so all you have to do is practice your stepping game,and your returns when they kick to ya,so practice catching bombs practice makes perfect mate!|`|e4roTumKaa	I reckon you are going to be to big, concentrate on playing centre, like Inglis or Falou, by the way I hope you come from Melbourne !!|`|eQuHCS6Haa	yes.|`|19f20e2d4418a571c6c83e15da6f04b2aa	Mate your only 13 and a unit. By the time you reach 18 you could be playing in the back row. You have so much more growing to do and also your agility and athelitism will play a factor on what position your suited to.   I guess at you present age you are bigger than most so I reckon play lock where you can mix it with the forwards or play a little wider with the backs.  E.g. Brad Fitler, Braith Anasta, Feliti Mateo. These players played in 5/8th and Lock. Develop your ball skills and strength|`|OsDdaGNgaa	you have the right height to be a fullback but how is your skill? Can you catch a high ball?|`|Uyz6iZwKaa	Yes you are!!!
wYGeg0QRaa	There's no doubt that Project X shafts feel good but flighted shafts are not the way to control the ball. Dynamic Gold offer the firm feel needed to develop a swing that will control the distances and I much prefer control to soft feel. I guess it's sort of like trying to drive a Cadillac sedan around a race course as opposed to a Mustang GT.|`|aX8nee8gaa	It honestly seems to vary based on the set that the shaft is in. Many forgings I like better with Dynamic Gold, but the cast clubs I seem to like the softer feel of P X. Go figure.|`|uJPPxyewaa	I have two sets of irons, one is the Titleist 735 combo cb/mb set with the project X shafts in them. Set is very smooth through impact, but the proj X is much harder to control distances i think.    Other set is 695mb with DG S200, made by true temper.This is my normal set because distance control and workability is much easier. I cant honestly tell you it is because of the shaft and not the club, but i do think that the shaft plays a big role in it.     Summary, Project X probably feels better, True Temper is easier to control and work the ball with. So it depends on what you are looking for. Better players like the control and feel, (most of the time), but it all depends on you.|`|Wa7wktLkaa	tru temper is the more consistent one out of the 2, but im with you i love the feel of proj x. i use true temper though.|`|nkPMesJdaa	tt's are good shafts. Friends like the project x but i prefer the tt. I have black golds in my 695.mb's and they are a good feel.|`|ayLYuIvOaa	Project X  i put them on my taylormade r7 TP and they are just great!!  true temper is also a very good shaft but i prefer Project X more
z6JExf0faa	I am not a Richmond supporter but would have to say that picking Ben Cousins was a courageous decision and one that can have a positive impact on the team.  One player won't win a premiership for them but with a group of young midfielders having a Brownlow Medallist and Premiership captain in their midst can only be good for the club.|`|qUBWjHq0aa	the only reason there is big hype about it is because  a) Ben Cousins  b) Graham Polak    leave the supporters alone as u would prob do the same thing with ur club|`|4wRyTY9Raa	So about a thousand people turn up to see an intra club match, that's ok, it's more about curiosity, give us a break,  we haven't played finals since 2001, we have a realistic chance this year with or without cousins, also fans wanted to see how polak went too.    I know what you mean but i reckon every clubs fans would be reacting the same way.|`|WifhQyD4aa	No I don't think so, they finished the season off well last year, and now they have an experienced on baller who was a very good player for WCE.     IF i was a tiger fan, i would be looking forward to the season, i think they will do well in 09.    - Go Hawks|`|VLCUDZlcaa	nah, leave 'em alone - i feel sorry for Tiger's supporter and their club.  The supporters are long suffering with having to watch poor performances year after year.    Hopefully Cousins will boost their membership and success!|`|Q3bcGeaOaa	No im a die hard lions fan and an old Fitzroy boy and i think they have every right to be happy at the pick ups and progress they are making at their club.

HkwUGOmxaa	I think it is best to buy the clothes a little big so that you can layer underneath on cold days. If you wear a medium go to a large. Always try them on as some companies run big and some styles small. Bring with you your base layers( hoody, long johns, fleece) so that you know for sure. Keep in mind that if yoy wait for the bigger sale you will be fighting the crowds and wont get as good of help from the staff. They can answer questions on waterproofness, breatheability, and durability. Ask more than one person as some stores pay commision and they will sell what they can make money on, what they have the most of or, what they "think " is the best. do some research on line. You DO get what you pay for. If you buy now you will have more to chose from. Stuff is already on sale. Think...if each item is 50% off later and 40% now...each item is 100 bucks...its only going to save you 20 bucks to wait. Go with your options now. Make sure you are comfortable. And think of how often you ride. It sounds odd but spend more on the pants to have higher waterproof rating. The jacket you can change easier if it gets wet and replace more often as styles change. More on plain pants ...less on coat. I have been riding for 16 years and worked in the snow industry for 8.|`|i1m35Ptdaa	I would check out the site...www.whiskeymilitia.com.....   great deals one at a time, just have a little patience and you'll find a killer deal...I would buy something big enough that you can layer underneath...most gear is made so that you can do this....so in summary buy a small if you wear small, it will be a little oversized as most snowboarding clothing is  and you'll be able to rock it for seasons to come...
iErG6IToaa	Definitely wait. That package may still be around after the season and on sale. Besides things that come in a package are not always the best that company has to offer. So, for the price of $563, you could buy much higher quality gear all ready for the next season. The season is half over anyway, and you would have to pay for it to be waxed (not saying its expensive) after you leave the slopes and before you put your board away for the season. So your spending more money and your not even getting a full season out of it. Also this gives you time to save up your money for even better equipment. Buy the board now if you want but just take these reasons to wait into consideration. :)|`|HkwUGOmxaa	you should be able to find stuff cheaper than that. buy on line and buy it a year old...last years close out stuff. your board and bindings at least and then go to a shop to buy your boots and have it put together. you need to make sure the boots fit good. most important. you should be able to find a board for 200 and bindings for 100. look at backcountry,com for 07-08 models. try a Ride solace and  ride lxh or vxn bindings. you can save some money this way and keep dad happy. last years stuff is still new and cheaper. someone is available on line to help with questions too. To research the product they have riders comments from using it as well or goto ridesnowboards.com. You can do better. for that much you can get pants and gloves too...|`|9ba14fd979418107a444a95b817d18fbaa	$563 is on the high end.  You should be able to buy a board and bindings online for under 300.  For boots go to the store and find a pair that are comfortable, not necessarily expensive.  Your boots are the most important thing, make sure they are right then worry about the board.
98f9000f3689e28983bfec6d7a62524baa	Firstly, I would like to correct you regarding players schooling in Wales, a majority of past and present Welsh players went to state run schools!    As Rugby is the second most popular sport, after Football in France and is mainly popular in the south, I would imagine that players come from both type's of schools!|`|Ml6mMDlvaa	You are aware that not all Irish Rugby players go to private school aren't you?  In Limerick all the rugby players play in 'normal' schools. St. Munchins for example has produced many Irish players including Keith Wood. Marcus Horan, Jerry Flannery and Keith Earls.     I'm sure the situation in France is the same as in any other country some go to private schools and some go to state schools.|`|d6Qb1GCQaa	Yeh you dont really know what your talking about! Most Irish rugby players come from regular state schools and not private schools!|`|hRQf8VV8aa	It might just be that all private schools offer scholarships to up and coming rugby player who play for counties or have been scouted. I know of one player who went to public school but got offered a scholarship to go to private school to play rugby.
aWLCj1T5aa	Morzine or Montgenevre in France are both great for novices, with some lovely long gentle wide runs so you are able to venture up the mountain without needing to be able to ski or board particularly well. They both have english speaking ski  school, my youngest son ( just 7 at the time ) was skiing down the mountain by day 2  in Morzine so no being stuck on the nursery areas. Both resorts have gondolas to get up the mountain so no struggling with chair lifts if your not very confident. Both resorts can be reached by Easy-jet, Morzine into Geneva and Montgenevre to Turin and both only take approx 1 1/2 hrs from airport to resort, many resorts can be 3-4 hrs   Catered chalet is by far the most luxuriest way to go but is far more expensive than self catering. The accomodation in Morzine can be a little way away from the ski area with some very steep hills which isn't good if you have to walk to the gondola in ski boots, carrying skis, and kids moaning !, Montgenevre has a more compact feel with some ski in and out accommodation. I don't think there is any such thing as cheap ski lessons in resorts but they are worthwhile even if only so you don't have to worry where you are going and if you are capable of skiing it. I dont know about the nightlife in either as we usually go with friends and kids so tend to relax over a meal and few drinks and then collapse shattered into bed. I think Montgenevre has the better snow history as it is higher, but i think everywhere has got fantastic snow this season. Dont forget that the exchange rate is really bad so lift passes and lessons will be expensive. Hope this was helpfull, we love both these resort and are off to Montgenevre in a few weeks, Skiing is such a great family holiday, have fun.|`|61zXWDN7aa	i would say whistler in canada but that is not cheap so i think verbier in switzerland is a safe bet as there is good apres ski and of course nightlife for you and your wife if not for your children! in my experience self catering is better and usually you can have a delivery to your chalet with basics like milk and bread before you get there! if not there will be a supermarket in the town really close probably. ski/board lessons won't be a problem and there's tourist information centres for that kind of thing - a lot of the ski/board instructors will speak english so that won't be difficult to find! you can usually do them for two hours, half a day or a full day and are reasonably priced.  i'm not sure how easy it will be to find accomodation but around this time i don't think it's too busy.  have a really nice time with your family!|`|70aa0db8082ddead46f656ecb978193aaa	Monaco or Winter Park, both in Colorado    or Angel Fire in New Mexico    All are great for beginners.|`|Lngb8ryFaa	where in the country are you?? are you driving or flying?? i could give you suggestions from everywhere from washington state to maine but that wont really help if i dont know where you are..try this website    http://www.skiresortguide.com/usamap.cfm|`|887362377ddb5359c6d05d5d3e830b4caa	Where ever you go, make sure that paramedics can access you guys and a hospital is close by.|`|SWxkfepuaa	i went to america 1st time sking at 13-14 go to lake tahoe its got nice easy slopes ranging to the impossible|`|qky1Q90xaa	Any of the CO resorts are great (Copper, Breckenridge, Winter Park, Keystone... though I am not crazy about Loveland - too icy). They all have resort towns at the base for people who are not athletic to spend part of the day if they do not want to be on the mountain for a full day. Copper is my favorite, but Breckenridge and Keystone have the best villages and are very close to Dillion, which could be a fun mountain town for your wife if she wants. All of the resorts have a wide variety of easy and challenging runs, and all offer private or group lessons for a full or half day. I find Winter Park to be a little flat for learning to snowboard - it is much easier if you learn on a little steeper terrain that you can get enough speed to turn with instead of just tripping over yourself.|`|jTaW3goeaa	Bristol Mountain, its the best place in New York.

In the US your cheapest bet is Utah just because you can stay cheap in Salt Lake City and drive to the resorts in under 30 minutes.  Lift tix there are cheap too.  Colorado can be very expensive as can Tahoe depending on where you go.      France is good but I don't think it is super affordable.
Cl6KbcAGaa	Yes Trek generally does run bigger and the best way to tell is to stand over the bike in a shoe that you would probably ride in or a walking shoe and with both feet on the floor flat, and one hand on the handlebar and one behind the seat lift the bike up into your crotch and you should have not more than 1 - 1 1/2" of clearance with both tires off the floor. This is the first best way to calculate if the size is at least close or correct for you. I personally believe that a 58 is too small for you and that at least a 60 would fit better on you for 6' 4" but I am not there to see and you are so try the stand over method first and go from there as there are many other factors that determine proper fit. Your inseam measurement may be short ie: short legs and long torso and since we are so very different in dimensions, Bob's could be correct in your size?|`|8THbk2PCaa	I'm 5'10" and ride a 56cm, seems like you'd want something a little bigger, at least 60cm. The best thing to do is to go down to your lbs and ride one. If the bike fits, buy it.|`|fbxqLErlaa	I will tell you a 58 cm is way too small.    How do I know?  I am 6'1" and ride a 60 cm or a 25 inch frame.    While you can get an extra long seat post, the handlebars will be way too low for comfort.  My custom framed tandem has a head tube 9 inches long.  No stock frame has a head tube that long.  Unless you have a very strong and flexible lower back, a 58 cm frame will be way too small.  Head tube is 7.5 inches long.  And you are 3 inches taller than me.    I like the bike and the way it is equipped.  I would mount LOOK pedals and a Specialized seat if it was my bike.  I would install a different cassette.  See URL below.  I would install the 11-32 if the derailleur were up to the task.  Good Luck|`|pV9wwEQMaa	Hmm... it seems alright... there are many more factors that need to be considered; not only height.  Like position and length of arms.  I'm 5'8.5 and use a 54cm.  You should get a bike professionally fitted; so they can include length of legs, arms, etc.      Bicycling is the best btw. :P I can't live without it hehe.|`|NUKWB93naa	I don't know anything about Trek but I can tell you I'm 6'2" and I ride a 58cm pretty comfortably. To my 6'4" sounds like you need to move up to a 60cm. If you're buying at a local shop be sure to get fitted.|`|zrhJHsUxaa	22" is perfect. If you want a longer stride adjust the seat higher.|`|fdf78d43fe1121f9be25f88e4fef9e3baa	Hm. I am 5'10" and ride a 58cm. I think you should get at LEAST a 60cm unless you have short legs.    That being said, Trek does have a long top tube but certainly not long enough for you at 58cm I wouldn't think.|`|F2h9clSnaa	I would say, as a rule, 58Cm is to small for someone 6'4'.   I am 6' and ride a 58-59cm depending on manufacturer and exact dimensions.   I would start at 60 or maybe larger and see just how well it fits you.  Take one for a test ride, and not just around the block. Ride it for a couple hours and see how comfortable you are with that size.|`|Z5xgSATSaa	58 cm is probably too small for you. From what I have seen, Treks are about average in sizing, smaller than some. For example, my son was riding a 54 cm Trek, and I found him a great deal on a 52 cm Look. We checked the measurements of the two bikes, and in all dimensions the two bikes were almost identical, so compared to his new bike, the Trek sizing was small.|`|CttL3LmBaa	Ok look at bikeworks and Mikey Y's answers.  They are approximately the same height and ride different frame sizes.  I am 6'0" and ride a 57cm (a 56 in even sized bikes).       My point:  You need to go get fitted to your bike.  It matters that you are comfortable on the bike and the size of the bike THEN makes no difference.  It becomes your bike and the size is just another number.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	You can check your measurments yourself or go to another bike shop.    http://www.coloradocyclist.com/bikefit
z28L84Cjaa	I certainly hope so!  I would love to see Federer retake his Wimbledon crown this year, reach 14 at his favorite Grand Slam, then move on to defend his US Open title and breaking the record with 15 Grand Slams.  I think the drive to retake Wimbledon will get him through, and Nadal is not as much of a force at the end of the season as he is during the first half.    Then maybe Federer can go back to actually enjoying tennis instead of trying stay on the pedestal fans and the media have placed him on.  He has taken quite a beating falling off that thing over and over again because he only made the finals instead of winning it all.|`|RC3WoqFkaa	he will. it'll be harder, but federer is still playing better than most of the other players|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	he would|`|U7BkuEU9aa	Yes, Rafa's got into his head, but as long as it's not him on the other side of the court, Fed can beat ANYONE, make no mistake...    Of course he'll beat Sampras' record. :-)|`|pWkWEXRoaa	yes he's got enough everything to do it|`|B8Gwxo1laa	Yes he will. Having had a virtually injury-free career, he still has many years of tennis ahead of him|`|dVXfDeGRaa	I think that Roger still has 2 or even 3 titles in him to win, its just that roger was so dominant and players like nadal started to work harder to get to the level of Roger. Now the difference between Roger and Nadal is that Roger doesn't even have a coach he is his own coach what we see on TV is pure natual Talent, I am sure that he will get himself a coach and start figuring different things out tactics etc. against Nadal. People are just way to fast to write off ROger i mean he was  1 for 4 years and in every final last year of grand slams except aussie. So yes he will equal 14 majors and more i think!!!|`|6ecdc0fb70eb839a2a22e77ecfde44e4aa	Pete got his 14th slam at 31 years of age and Roger is still 27 years of age so there is no reason why Roger can't do it. A coach could help him out at this point to deal with Rafa and Andy Murray. Roger has the game but he needs different strategies when he is playing these people. Also, Roger is going to retire in 2012, so technically there are 15 grandslams between now and then and he sure has the game to pull out 2/15 slams between now and then. However, he will be under a lot of pressure to get these two slams and he needs to let it go and play his natural game. The answer to your question is more a yes than a no. Go Rogi!|`|2m1hbw2iaa	He's only gotta win 2-3 and he'll top in those record books.  There's no reason to suspect he'll be unable to do this over the next 4-5+ years.|`|1ieKW07Naa	I believe that eventually Federer will best Sampra's record. It will only happen if Nadal gets upset before the finals in each open. Federer will also never win the French Open, but he has great chances at Wimbledon, AO and US.|`|2236ceecfd3a3407e11a4bab14969c07aa	Before Australia Open Final, I do believe that Federer can equal or beat Sampras 14 major titles.  But, after Australia Open Final, I think Federer can only satisfy with "13" in his life.    It is not joking, this is second time Federer was so close to the champion and finally he only can see the champion flying away...    Furthermore, more and more players already pick up and have potential to beat Federer anytime. (see Federer struggled in 4th round Australia Open)    Time will prove that Federer will start to lost to more and more players in grand slam.    Frankly speaking, Nadal will be the only person to beat Sampras's 14 major titles record...|`|xLyNsywiaa	He will and its gonna be at the US Open or Wimbledon this year...|`|DubchQ6Waa	yes, i think that Federer will win 4 more grand slam titles in his career  one of them will be Roland Garros
Ar5IuU2Uaa	I love North Face jackets - by far my favourite brand, though can't speak for the Berghaus equivalent.    Try them on, make sure they have a decent hood (N.Face's are brilliant)  that fits comfortably and you can zip the jacket all the way up - as both features will help keep you warm on the cold days!|`|AA11573840	They are both good, but I would go with NF.

There's a live chat with Rafa!!! That is so freakin awesome!!! Ya just made my day. Keep tryin man cause ya get to chat with RAFA!!! Vamos! =)|`|MlxgjS5Laa	Plz if u wanna chat with rafael nadal you have to chat according to spanish time. OK. If u think that how many hours difference between spanish and greece timing.So greece is 1 hour more forward than spain. For example, if now greece time is 1:56, so that spanish time will 12:56 Ok. If u wanna chat with nadal sit on that time as the time has been set in the site according to spanish time. For Example, If the time has been set 5:00, it means that this time will be in greece 6:00. OK Bye    Thanks
l4WEwTWwaa	OK. There are so many things I have to address that have me furious about what you wrote. The first thing I absolutely have to address first is the mentioning of the win over Gatti as notable. Gatti was never an A fighter and was a notable B level fighter. That was not a notable win. Gatti was never an A lister and was beyong his prime in that fight. He beat a 34 yr old B class club fighter. NOT A NOTABLE WIN. Baldomir, not a notable win as well. He has 12 losses on his record and has nine when he fought mayweather, not notable. Next the Castillo fight was one of the worst decisions I've ever seen in my life, easily a robbery and gift decision for May, not notable. Next Hatton was not notable, he fought nothing but euros and came to America for only two fights like Calzaghe. You can't fight your whole career in your comfort zone and leave it once and claim you are a true champ. I'm still mad about you naming Gatti actually. Honestly I hate all Mayweather fans that claimed he was the best p4p fighter after beating a way done Gatti. To this day it still annoys me. Next like I said about Calzaghe, all euro bums on that list. Jones and Hopkins were near or past 40 when they fought, not notable. Lacy has never been a good fighter and at 32 has held one world title that he lost his first defense. He was rushed too quick for Cal and regardless it was not notable. The only legite win on both fighter's cards is Kessler. So you're asking Calzaghe or Mayweather? My answer is neither one. Both overrated, both fought crap their whole careers, both are a disgrace to boxing and make me sick.|`|VRnJ6aqBaa	i think floyd was the better fighter but joe fought more opposition. with the people you named how many of them were real competition for floyd? he could have fought cotto,margarito, tzu,freites, and a few others instead of dodging them. floyd more tahn likely would have beaten them all but just chjose not to|`|6QhACK70aa	Both great fighters!  99% of people who call these 2 names are people who judge everything from the couch of their house!  HAVE u ever be in a ring???  u do not win 46 and 39 matches WITH NO SKILLS GET OVER URSELVES THE HATERS|`|ZzXxRLWcaa	Floyd clearly had the better career.    Calzaghe beat two over the hill fighters (Bhop, Jones), two overrated fighters (kessler & Lacy) and then a bunch of Welsh Soupcans.    He never left his home country except for the last 2 paydays, that will always be a drawback against him.    Floyd on the other hand fought and won in big fights... giving most people (except for Margarito, Williams and Cotto) a chance.    Floyd is a big mouth and all, but gotta give props.|`|tA5DrAPpaa	Neither of them faced the best competition available, but Floyd at least fought REAL boxers.    That's right, Joe fought a bunch of losers from Wales.    Floyd may have dodged as well, but his division was way better.|`|2k8TEiRtaa	Both of them deserve their props as being true professionals. But I prefer Joe Calzaghe. I saw him fight many times and he is one of the best boxers. Very experienced and places his punches where he decides to. A very accurate boxer.|`|AA10961618	floyd has more speed and agility|`|O9NHDTj3aa	im not been smart but that has to be a trick question coz there is only one answer to that its floyd man cmon if any1 says calzaghe the need there head checked.|`|oWgmh7Qyaa	The de la hoya fight was rumored to be rigged? hatton wasnt a fair fight?

UeFCAWW2aa	Yes and he will go down as one of the greatest boxers ever.|`|l4WEwTWwaa	Not at all. Calzaghe in his entire career did not face a single quality opponent other than Kessler. Kessler could have outboxed him easily if he didn't fight like he was scared of him. Calzaghe in 46 fights has beat no one in his prime and a big name. Jones and Hopkins were way past their primes and could have easily knocked him out if it had been a few years earlier. In my opinion boxers do not have the right to retire until they fight the best competition out there. It annoys me that a few stupid Americans and British people will call one of the greatest ever when he ducked everyone and could not have done anything against real american fighers instead of euro trash and welsh cab drivers.|`|8xyFCsMRaa	Nope. joe is constantly maligned for not having faced quality opponents. not that its the guys fault.  no one notable would go up in weight to face him.    however, since he cannot find any good challenger, he should have move up in weight to challenge other champions.    if he retires now.  he would be considered as another mayweather.|`|VRnJ6aqBaa	yeah. besides dawson that really was not a fight people wanted to see or a big money maker joe had no other fights to pursue that were worth it.|`|5fabd1dde8996146708da2f18d2feea8aa	I think Joe did the right thing.  He has nothing left to prove and nobody left to prove it against.  Joe is now 36, which is getting up there, and some people seem to think he should keep fighting until he loses.  Too many fighters keep going until they are a shadow of their former selves, and we tend to remember them more from their last fights than from their best fights.      I congratulate Joe on his career and his decision to end it.  He leaves with an undefeated record and a brain that hasnt been scrambled by too many hard shots to the head.  Thats the way a great fighter should go out.  He has no obligation to give Hopkins a rematch or stay around to give Dawson a chance to beat him.    I hope Joe and Ricky Hatton get together and have a couple of beers.|`|2k8TEiRtaa	I agree with Scott M. He did the right thing. In his division, there are not many who could have beat him. He could have fought at other weight classes. But he apparently did not want to. And good for him. Take DLH and Pacman as an example.|`|vDvxaevcaa	Maybe. But if no one disagree then he must hang up his gloves and never to fight again.    Pacquiao on the other hand has all the right to call quits if he win against Hatton. That will only prove that no fighter at this time can beat the Pacman.
LUnscegvaa	Depends how you train, as a former boxer boxing is full contact, Tkd may not be, but they specialize in kicking techniques and since the leg is longer than the arm I'd favour that ,as in stop kicking whether to the abdomen or the knees or if able and confident the head.    Best wishes :)***|`|N2O9LUwaaa	I'm am a black belt in Tae Kwon Do, and, by itself, it is a bit weak as far a self defense goes. However, my instructor is also a black belt in Hapkido (sp? A defensive martial art), Judo (throws and grappling), and  jujitsu (pressure points) so I get a lot of that thrown into the mix. As for boxing, you get hand techniques from tae kwon do along with a lot of other things too. If you are looking to defend yourself,though, my instructor also offers MMA (mixed martial arts) and kickboxing classes, and they are awesome, and make you feel like you could avoid getting your butt handed to you. Hope this helps.|`|XpKY04Tnaa	Taekwondo weak? Please! Go to a full contact tournament and see who's butts are being kicked. The Taekwondo people will be the ones at the trophy presentations.|`|0b1a38ddb028d9a6c669ad7b4e4f3db8aa	A friend of mine did taekwondo for years and years. He was a bit of a fanatic actually... then one night he got into a fight with a guy in a pub who'd been doing boxing for only a few months and he got seriously battered! For this boxer..my friend was just another opponent and he was quite use to being hit. For my friend..it was his first proper fight. Boxing makes you incredibly tough. If you think being hit on the nose hurts...try it 6 times in a row.    (he told me later that he'd found it virtually impossible to apply any taekwondo once this fight really kicked off and got dirty. It was about as much use as ballroom dancing)..|`|gJzEAvNTaa	i don't know what kind of body type you have so i can't say for sure  i'm 5'11", 198lbs, and i prefer stand up and striking  so i primarily practice boxing, cross train with colleagues in any martial art, more the better for exp    if you're young and unsure, check out what you like, go to both. i tried boxing at a young age, liked and stuck with it. but that don't mean i didn't try other like tkd, judo, mma, jujitsu, wushu, wing chun, wrestling etc. some i didn't like, some i found useful. also the more exposed you are to different fighting styles, you know how to deal w/ it when you face similar technqiues    anyway, if you want a dynamic work out? go for tkd. it's teaches a good mix of kicks, straight, roundhouse, back, and punches, but it's not for self defense. it is a SPORT. one rule they have is: NO HITTING THE FACE. so that pretty much takes out any realism of a street fight. there are tkd practitioners at our mma and their training is sub par. if you close the distance quick against a kicker, he no longer has the option of kicking, and many tkd don't know what to do in that scenario b/c they don't train for it    however, tkd is good for practicing kicks b/c the rules limit your options so you exclusively kick. like weightlifters exclusive do bicep curls to train their bicep|`|3DnX9NmAaa	No martial art is better than another. I myself would prefer TKD so I could train in kicks as well as punching, but Boxing would also be a great choice.|`|XBUeYE41aa	Depends on what you want from the martial art- defense, health,tournaments?  I would say Taekwondo for all around use. Did a bit of tournament training with some others in school- the local former boxing champ was matched against me a couple times and didn't think he needed fighting cup against old crock- took him a couple times to learn triple punch boxing toward head wouldn't stop back kick to groin. Point for foot work. Boxing can still be a good choice for defense and sport- but the lack of lower body targeting and lack of offenseive foot training sort of makes it incomplete. Kata/heien forms good health training missing in boxing.|`|sj902Wyuaa	Don't listen to what people say about taekwondo if they don't take it.  Looking Down upon a martial art if you aren't man enough to do it is like the 8th deadly sin (JK)    You should Take taekwondo.  It is more useful than wrestling.  You learn kicks, punches, flips, and life skills.  You learn stuff that applies to real life.|`|LnJjS8BRaa	It actually has more of a reputation for being taught badly. There is a huge difference.    Check out the TKD schools in your area and try them out. If there are more than one you should be able to see the difference. Make sure the instructor is qualified through the kukkiwon (central organization governing taekwondo across the world).    I also recommend that you check out any other martial arts or boxing gym in your area. Try them all out and get a feel for what they are like and which you will enjoy most. Once again, find the best teacher you can because their guidance will make the difference.|`|4LYasBGXaa	boxing-    without knowing any info about a specific dojo or boxing gym, i can tell you that on average boxing will give you realistic training tkd will not.    tkd might make a good supplement even if you train at a place that doesn't train realistically- but you should get a basic background and learn about what realistic training is, and what someone coming after you with controlled aggression (and skill) is.    most tkd gyms train for a specific ruleset- such rulesets are very very unrealistic in crucial ways-    such as not permitting punches to the head, counter punching and breaking upon scoring contact and the "first to hit wins".      this leads to your training consisting of dangerous tactics you would not otherwise employ since you need to protect yourself.    boxing on the other hand does not limit any of that and the mere exclusion of kicks and legs is not an issue since it can be trained later but at least you have an idea what a real person coming after you is due to boxing sparring-    also as far as hands go- boxing is second to none to develop punching power and hand skills in striking.    yes- there are other arts you can take to add on- but boxing is hands down the better option of the two-    if you like you can train in a semi-legit tkd gym later even to learn kicking technique but overall IMO- a muai thai or sanda gym would be a better bet as it would save you the time of "putting it together" yourself and help you develop additional skills.    again- if you can find a tkd gym that trains realistically, then go for it- but needle in a haystack is the operative term here.    as for tkd vs. grappling?    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2y8b5QgX...    EDIT:    MMA (as i think you mean the modern day organizations putting on mma fights) is not as "close to a real fight as you can get" vale tudo rules and early ufc before regulation was "as close to a real fight as you can get"-    yes i'm bieng a pain in the ***- i know what you meant.  and many people touted in modern day mma were upset abotu teh regulation of it as it was "not real" anymore-    ironically, these are the same people that many anti-mma people claim are not "real". (i think you know who i'm talking about)|`|gJ3Y1Kycaa	i do taekwondo and used to do boxing when i was younger. both are very good but i prefer tkd. tkd is not weak if taught properly, there are two types of tkd one is WTF tkd which is the one that you see in the olympics. this involves alot of high and flashy kicks and not many punches, this is the one that is mostly known about and is assumed to be weak.  the other type is ITF tkd, this is the one that i do and it is much more combat orientated similar to kick boxing . punches and kicks are allowed anywhere above ther waist and is done at full contact. also you learn throws, take downs, joint locks aswell as the punching, kicking , kneeing, elbowing and low kicking techneiques that you would need in a street fight for self defence. WTF tkd might contain these but im not sure as i dont practice this.    there is alot of ignorance when it comes to tkd, people look on you tube or at the oylimpics and think that what they see in tkd in its intiraty, when actually its only a fraction of what tkd actually is. when i first started tkd i thought that my boxing experience would mean that sparring you be easy for me. ok the boxing experience helped but i wasnt prepared for being hit from 4 pionts and not the 2 that i was used to. the kicking part was very good to learn aswell as kicks are very powerfull and a low kick to the knee in a street fight will suprise the attacker and hurt them alot, may even break the knee. the joint locks and throws are very good aswell for preparing yourself when an attacker grabs you.    both are good though and its more important that you enjoy the art that your doing because it will take alot of dedication to be able to learn an art efficiently enough to defend yourself you cant just take a few classes then expect instant results it takes time and if you dont enjoy what your doing then you wont take it in. go to a few clubs and see what one you prefer . and dont listen to the people that say one art is better than another or another art is weak because these people are just ignorant its the fighter not the style which wins a fight. tony barada did tkd and used his knowledge to win 6 world kick boxing titles. also there are other good mma fighters who use tkd such as serkan yilmaz, lukasz jurkowski and cung lee who has a black belt in tkd.    i hope this helps and good luck and remember to follow your OWN mind when choosing what one to do.    omg so many stupid people who coment who dont know f%*k all about martial arts. tkd no punches to the head what are you on about you CAN punch to the head in tkd. when you actually do a full contact martial art you will see that boxing is weaker due to the fact that it is one dimentional and does use any kicks, throws or use of the powerfull elbows and knees like tkd does!!!!!!|`|N5SVU6Xwaa	tkd is mostly show, by show i mean flashy kicks and spinning kicks and crap, do boxing or muay thai for striking and for the single best for the street is krav maga|`|2mpgINV4aa	it depends;  are yo taking these lessons for sport/exercise/fun   or a re you looking for some real life application? (:D)  If you must use it in a fight, boxing is probably your best bet. You spar, punches to the face, conditioning, and everything.  Taekwondo is dangerous too, but like somebody mentioned, look out for the good organizations or teachers, especially if their ITF. It's the closest you'll get to the real taekwondo they used to teach, not this watered down sport.   Of course, it all comes down to practice. Tae kwon do and boxing both have the same exercises applicable.  but still, charging into your enemy's defenses works better than manipulating the dude from the outside with kicks.|`|AFkjkqcSaa	I think boxing.  I do boxing and mixed martial arts myself, I have since the age of 14.  Boxing develops you both physically and mentally, I am no way bad mouthing TWK I believe that if you get into bother u can apply what uve learnt in boxing, where as TWK it would be difficult.  Kung Fu is the same, its am amazing art but the kicks are quite flicky, where as in boxing after a few months you develop strenght and muscles.  You cold always try kickboxing? Dont go for the girly soft version tho as you learn nothing!!!  Mikey is right in what he says!!|`|zfHj0KGkaa	Boxing, I did TKD most of my life (age 4-14) and 90% of it went out the window when I started MMA, which is about as close to a real fight as you can get.  Basically read what Mikey said, it's totally right and I just wanted to confirm that he's not the only one who thinks that.|`|TL41ZHmtaa	listen i have takin both and BOXING is the better one. i know this because you get used to contact, realistic contact. with tkd it is mostly slow powerful kicks, but in a fight you want fast kicks to the legs and punches. you should really take something that teaches you to grapple, i suggest jujitsu.|`|w02Z4Mnhaa	Personally I would do boxing, basically because of my own body type, attitude and preferences.    But you're not me.  Taekwondo is in your mind to choose, so choose it.  It isn't a weak martial art.  It is a martial art.    There's a lot of bs in this thread from people saying TKD is pants, and some saying that it's the greatest martial art of all time.  The best martial art is the one you enjoy.  Go for it.|`|job9o5ioaa	They're good, as long as you get busy with any form of mma, it'll be a win win situation, you know.    You should see, which one interests you more, thats it.    Would you like to use your hands thus   punch more (boxing) or use your feet(taekwondo).    If you've already have the Taekwondo on your mind, go for that in which i would sincerely suggest that.|`|0hHw5IK7aa	TaeKwondo definately - there's no way it's a weak sport! It is linked to Thai boxing and there's less chance you're going to come home with cauliflower ears and teeth missing!|`|DkvqVmfyaa	Honestly, it's totally up to you in which art you choose to do. Both have their advantages and disadvantages, what really matters in the end is how much to train and how dedicated you are.     I am biased towards Tae Kwon Do, but i do recognise that boxing has it's pluses too. I'd like to dispell a myth that seems to have been propagated quite a bit in this section, Tae Kwon Do is by no means a weak art. There's simply no such thing and as for strength and speed I have seen demonstrations which definately prove that Tae Kwon Do is lacking in neither. It's true that the art in which I study (yes I said ART, I study under a traditional ITF affilate which has set principles and values which must be adhered to and there's no point scoring so it;s an ART) is centred around kicks, but there's certainly no shortage of effective hand techniques at your disposal which I use just as often if not more so in free sparring.      Another thing is what you see at the Olympics is WTF the sport version of the art and I can honestly tell you if I was to jump about like that in a sparring match in class I'd be floored and laughed at. What you learn in class (at least an ITF one from my knowledge) is nothing like what's shown at those matches, most of the time at least one foot is firmly planted on the ground.     As for Tae Kwon Do being lacking in self defence techniques, it's a bunch of bull. Every pattern you learn and every combination you memorise is there to use at your disposal when you're in a fight. I don't know about other clubs but there's a point to one-step, three-step and free sparring not to mention all the self-defense techniques which have been developed. I know I've harped on but my point is essentially this do what you truly want to do and if you love it then stick with it, don't let what anyone else tells you influence what you want to do. All that I've tried to do is give you an insight into what I've learned from the 5 years I've been doing Tae Kwon Do and bring balance to the argument. If you find Tae Kwon Do isn't for you then it isn't for you, boxing might not be for you either.     Just remember the right instructor will make all the difference, I swapped instructors about 2 years into my training and I've gotten the motivation I needed to push myself harder. The same applies for boxing, if your instructor is someone who gets you motivated and moving then stick with it :)

If you are coming in from out of state stop in denver first...there are sales and they will be better than the mountain prices right now. Go to T.S. board shop in Denver...good knowledgeable staff and then try Colorado ski and golf in aurora for some of the largest selection you will ever see in your life. The first shop can work with you on price better and may have used bindings freeing up more money to spend on boots. Their number is303-282-8972. its where I go. ask for Brian the owner or doug the manager for your best help
DhEZj9cKaa	Why are you worried about wifi when you are on a ski trip.  Do yourself a favor and forget about your computer/cellphone and enjoy getting away.  Cut yourself off from the rest of the world.
VEScnfoHaa	Yes, you should improve your technique. Practicing is a key here, because some people who have almost no strength in their arms are also capable of playing as well as others who have more strength. Also, I don't have enough details about your skills to tell you what position you would have advantages in. With less physical strength, I would probably suggest that you don't be the setter, because they have to run around everywhere and have a very important job during the game. I would suggest that you look up good techniques that could improve your skill while you slowly gain your physical strength. Also, videos of good techniques and forms would be recommended.|`|jxm3yEHRaa	speed quickness    also what the other two said|`|EtWIJrR2aa	you need to make sure you have all the basic skills down,    bumping, setting, hitting, bit of blocking    you dont have to display power, you just gota do the technique right  and speed will almost always make up for lack of power!     the position you should play really depends on what your best skill is out of the basics; bumping, setting, hitting, blocking    but the best position for someone not exactly strong is setter, but you have to have great setting    otherwise try libero or back court bumper (serve receiver) but you need to be fast for those    have fun, good luck

They can impound the bike.  They can call a local wrecker service and you end up paying the tow and the impound fee.  Or they can simply write you a ticket if the infraction doesn't warrant being arrested.    Why would you need to be patted down?  A frisk only happens when a weapon is suspected on the suspect.

d754b3be3baefac8167410c09de8770faa	You're right about one thing: AI SHOULD'VE NEVER LEFT PHILLY, but he had no choice. If you look at what happened in his latter days that led to his leaving, you will see that it was completely justifiable. First, they suspended him and Chris Webber for missing a team function (so petty), then his coach tried to hate on him and they had problems with the sorry system he was trying to run. Factor in a losing record where the losses just continued to pile up and you have a real crisis. Then, the entire organization took his name and likeness out of the arena by taking his nameplate out of the locker room and refusing to show videos and highlights that featured him as the face and identity and heartbeat of that franchise. If an organization treated you that way, wouldn't you leave too?    And you're right when you say that he's one of the most difficult players to fit on a team. He is someone who demands respect because of his ball-handling and playmaking abilities and because he's the point guard, he's the shot caller, the QB if you will, of a team. They should've never traded Chauncey Billups for AI. Detroit would've been better off keeping Chauncey because at least HE got the Pistons to the Finals! Chauncey was a true point guard who knew when to slow down the offense, move the ball around, and get everybody involved in the flow of the game. This season, in order to pacify AI, they put HIM in the starting lineup and bench Rip. How are you gonna bench a guy who has one of the main players in Detroit's system for years for someone who, in all of his years, never started to grasp the current concept of team ball until the Sixers reached the Finals in '01 (even then, he was still leading them)? Doesn't make any sense!    The Pistons should try to get him back. If not, he'd be better off in places like Indiana, Los Angeles (the Clips), Minnesota, or Charlotte. But i doubt he'll want to go to a losing team. That's too much of a hassle to start over. They should put AI at the point and move rip to the SG spot and bring Stuckey off the bench. AI is too established to be coming off the bench. Stuckey still has a learning curve. He has shown flashes of brilliance and will show even more as the point guard of the future of the Pistons when AI retires.|`|VRnJ6aqBaa	he should go to a team that has a iso offense and a great bench. Iverson is a great penetrator and can score, but his shooting is not the best and his 3s are worse. he is not a real good passer as we saw with nene in the post. Iverson never learned how to really penetrate and kick out.    honestly i could see him playing for memphis. they are young have very little real offense and iverson could play there without any bother.|`|j6R8OC7Vaa	Iverson can fit anywhere, like the trunk of a car or in a suitcase.    Actually he's a great fit for any team that needs an explosive scorer off the bench - which IS WHAT THE PISTONS should be doing. In fact he would be a wonderful sixth man for all 30 NBA teams. Just imagine Iverson increasing leads for the Celtics sorry bench or actually providing rest for Lebron in Cleveland. Any team really, those are just some examples.|`|HDbMh2YBaa	Yes he is and its tougher now with his skills declining. He's better off going to a team with a big point guard that can check 2 guards. When you have Iverson he's going to either check someone too tall or he'll have to check the pg. Otherwise Iverson would have to come off the bench.    I have no clue where he would fit in at. Most likely a team that struggles to score. Maybe the T Wolves or the Raptors. I cant see many teams starting him.|`|1W5b0n07aa	its not even really his game on the offensive end, he is being exposed by bigger shooting guards on the defensive end.|`|UIi7B3UDaa	i think ai is better at SG he would fit well at SG in Charlotte with Augustine he would have to just worry about srcoring like Raymond Felton is doing now  They would have a pretty good team  PG-Augustin  SG-Iverson  SF-Bell  PF-Wallace  C-Okafor    they would kinda be the old Phoneix suns  C-Okafor|`|lgB7SD46aa	I agree he fits better in prison|`|Rhk35LUcaa	ai is one of those players where you build a team around him    you dont build a team with ai|`|4fsH2CESaa	i agree with ddhillon_24

Potential bids    [edit] Asia        * Flag of Kazakhstan Almaty, Kazakhstan[1]    Almaty bid for the 2014 Winter Olympics, but did not make the short list. Meanwhile, it will gain valuable experience hosting the 2011 Asian Winter Games. Some of the venues to be used are the outdoors Medeo ice skating rink and Shymbulak Ski Resort.[2]        * Flag of the People's Republic of China Harbin, China    Li Zhanshu, governor of Heilongjiang has stated that "If the hosting of the 2009 Winter Universiade can win applause from all the guests, it will enhance our confidence to bid for the Winter Olympic Games."[3] Harbin bid for the 2010 Winter Olympics, but did not make the short list.        * Flag of South Korea Pyeongchang, South Korea[4]    After narrowly losing twice in bidding for the 2010 and 2014 Winter Olympics, Governor Jin-sun Kim of Gangwon Province announced in September 2007 that Pyeongchang will definitely bid a third time. He quoted increased knowledge of the bid process and the still high enthusiasm of residents (87.7% of Korean and 77.3% of Gangwon residents) as signs to keep trying.[5][6] Presidential candidates and politicians have since questioned his premature announcement and probed bookkeeping issues.[7][8] The city officially announced its bid in January 2009.[9]    According to one IOC member, Pyeongchang will need to find a new angle for its third bid, as its theme of bringing peace to the Korean peninsula runs the risk of sounding stale if stressed for a third time.[10]    [edit] Europe    On July 4, 2007 Sochi, Russia was selected to host the 2014 Winter Olympics.[11] Although the IOC does not have a formal rotation policy, awarding games back to back on one continent has been uncommon after World War II,[12] lessening chances of European candidates.        * Flag of Sweden Sweden            * ?re          * ?stersund    When Sochi, Russia was revealed to host the 2014 Winter Games, Sveriges Radio announced that a bid for the 2018 Winter Olympics will be investigated by SOK (The Swedish Olympic Committee) together with the Swedish government, an application for the ninth time.[13]        * Flag of Ukraine Bukovel, Ukraine    The Ukrainian government announced in 2006 that Ukraines popular Bukovel ski and snowboard resort is expanding to 262 acres (1.06 km2) in anticipation of Ukraine bidding to host the 2018 Winter Olympic Games. The additional land will be used for the construction of several new ski lifts and service projects. Previously, the land was a government-managed forest area.[14] Bukovel has also plans to build an Olympic winter stadium in preparation for a possible bid.[15]        * Flag of Turkey Bursa, Turkey    Located just near the highest mountain of Western Anatolia, some of the events would be held at the Uluda? National Park.[16]        * Flag of France France    At first, the French Olympic Committee was quite reluctant in bidding for a Winter Games, preferring to focus on a bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics.[17] However, four cities expressed interest in hosting the 2018 games. On September 24, 2008, the Olympic Committee announced it had granted these wishes and would bid in 2011.[18] The following cities expressed their interest:            * Annecy - Intended to bid for the 2014 Games.          * Grenoble - Host of the 1968 Winter Olympics          * Nice          * Pelvoux          * Flag of Switzerland Geneva, Switzerland    Geneva is launching a bid pending a public referendum.[19] Geneva's plans include hosting alpine events at Crans-Montana, two hours from the city, and possibly the resorts of Verbier and Vernayaz as well.[20]    Despite being seen as a front runner by pundits, the Swiss Olympic Committee does not support the bid, with SOC head Joerg Schild saying hosting the Games would not boost the country's well-developed winter tourism market, and Switzerland's federal political system makes it difficult to generate national support for a sports project that would largely benefit one region or town.

cKXZOLJSaa	I usually don't eat for about an hour before. if you eat anything less than 15-20 minutes before your race, let it only be a banana. it will help alot fyi.|`|WrDGhduxaa	everyone is different some can run in one hour and some take more than two hours.  it is up to your stomach as to when you can run.  I don't think the bar is going to give you any energy while you run, the main concern is not to have an upset stomach.|`|Dh8i9msPaa	I eat while I run too.|`|isf5gDbmaa	Eating before your race is very important. It all depends on when your race starts.  If your race is in the beginning of the meat, and you are away, then i would eat on the bus on my way there.  If you are having a home meat, then i would eat it after school ends, and before my uniform is on.  It also depends on your body.  You can eat it 15-20 minutes before you race starts it will give you enough time to get your energy up.  I run the 400m and i eat it 3 events before mine starts because the 400m is towards the end.  But you need to make sure that you drink lots of water, before and after every event you watch,it will give your body enough time to proses your starches before you start running, and you won't get cramps.   Good luck with your meats.
fHJqqMzLaa	check your other snorkeling gear question.  I posted an answer there|`|yS5f1XLFaa	um wat kind of snorkeling. cuz i do snorkeling in swim practice and u use a dif kind of snorkel. it is made by finis and curves weirdly so dat u dont get water in it while u swim.
fHJqqMzLaa	As far as the snorkeling mask.  Comfort and fit is the main priority.  Stay away from plastic lenses as they have a tendency to scratch quite easily.  Tempered glass lenses are the best. The skirting of the mask (the part that actually comes into copntact with the face should have a double seal and be made of hypoallergenic soft silicone rather than rubber which degrades faster.  The following link will help you make an educated decision as far as what you would like you mask to do for you.    http://www.snorkelingonline.com/snorkeli...    There is also a short video to show you how to check for fit of a mask.    http://www.snorkelingonline.com/snorkeli...    There are many different styles of snorkels; open tube, semi dry and ddry snorkel.  The open tube are the least expensive but do not keep the water from entering the bore from splashed water or should it go beneath the surface of the water.  The semi dry snorkel will deflect splashed water from entering the the snorkel bore while in use but will still fill with water when the unit is syubmerged completely below the water's surface.  The dry snorkel incorporates a flapper or a float valve (or combination) which will close the snorkel bore when the entire unit is submerged.  I snorkel as well as scuba dive and personally prefer the benefits of the dry snorkel above all others.  They are more expensive but make for a more enjoyable snorkeling experience.  My favorite is the Ultra Dry snorkel by Oceanic.  Here is a link with a picture and description.    http://www.snorkelingonline.com/snorkel/...    There is a guide on how to select the snorkel for your needs here:    http://www.snorkelingonline.com/snorkels...    and to view the different styles available click the following:    http://www.snorkelingonline.com/snorkeli...    The fins that are becoming more and more popular with snorkelers these days are what are called "travel ready" which take up less room in suitcases while traveling.  Fantastic for snorkeling but not so good for scuba diving.  I prefer the strap style fins in the travel ready styles personally.  The last few links will be for a guide of (you guessed it) how to select fins and the different styles that are available.    http://www.snorkelingonline.com/snorkeli...  http://www.snorkelingonline.com/snorkeli...    The other equipment guides can be found here.  http://www.snorkelingonline.com/snorkeli...  These will cover more on the equipment as well as some great snorkeling tips.  One of the least expensive mask, fins, snorkel combo with a mesh bag runs $49.95  http://www.snorkelingonline.com/snorkeli...

cczy8FfEaa	Do you happen to have a slight interest in practicing one form over the other (Stand-up over grappling or vice-versa?). To get the most out of your workout, ideally, you would want something to is tailored towards your style.    For a good start, on getting fit with what you have, do a jump-rope routine before every workout if possible. Start out small and jump-rope for 1 minute x3 times with 20 second breaks. You don't have to do it quickly, just keep it steady. When you feel the improvement, then bump it up to about 5 times from the 3.    I suggest doing the same thing with the speed, kicking, and boxing bags. Same intervals if your looking to improve cardio. These workouts are a good start. I hope this helps and your future training is enjoyable.|`|yFX0mdOhaa	If you have a few bucks to spend, I recommend the Bas Rutten Mixed Martail Art workout... it's available online... google it.      Outside of your bag work though, I would find a grappling partner.  No matter what cardio shape you are in, if you aren't used to grappling, you will get exhausted in no time if you aren't used to it.      For the bag, set a timer for 2 to 5 minutes, and work different combinations... after every punching combination, end it with a kick.  Go strong, and keep moving your feet until the timer goes off.  Take a minute or two break, and go for another round.
EOxqdThTaa	There's no one specific best shoe for males or females. Running shoes are put into categories like neutral or stability, for how people run differently.

I go to a running shoe store myself, and i find it very help full.  I usually get new shoes before every season.
TPZwmQK9aa	The people who do this in Oklahoma do it nothing like coon hunting.  They use greyhounds, along with multiple vehicles with two way radios, and sometimes even use spotter aircraft.  They turn the dogs loose in a section (square mile of land) where a coyote has been spotted, and the dogs run it down then tear it to shreds.    Though I am a lifelong hunter, I do not consider this to be a humane sport in the least, and am personally disgusted by it.|`|AA11570394	It been a long time, but yes a fellow took me coursing coyotes. It was a learning experience for sure! And a lot of fun, well not for the coyote!  Here is a link about this sort of hunting;  http://www.gameandfishmag.com/hunting/ra...  Near bottom of page.|`|DHIudHy2aa	I have. It is not so much so we get to hunt the coyotes as it is that the dogs get to run around for a day.|`|caecd9e3d614f2b68ccbea2108f571efaa	No, but I have seen people do it. Yotes can run like all hell compared to a coon. The guys I know have lots of space and follow the hounds in a truck when they can.    EDIT: If you teach your coon hounds to trail coyote too, you will probably regret having to chase coyote for MILES and MILES. Get seperate hounds.|`|kY3uuTq9aa	not a good idea because the coyote will attack you dog because of territory reasons|`|6muUXIGoaa	nope|`|M2BCOFo4aa	My crazy niece Jolene and myself used to take the dogs out in the jeep in Maricopa (Arizona), and shoot coyotes and the wild dogs that ran with them. Jolene used a Mossberg 500 Cruiser pistol grip shotgun. This was a necessary endeavor because once abandoned domestic dogs started running with the coyotes, they had no fear of humans. Many people would be injured and even some deaths from these packs.
vs4iawqXaa	i use air arms they are around 5 a tin but the accuracy is great and they go out of the barrel more smooth|`|TPZwmQK9aa	Whichever RWS model is on sale.
Z8UV6S3baa	Hmmmm. Any price? This is tough. Hmmmm. Probably one of the following:    1) Theoben Crow Magnum - .20 caliber, 5 tins Crossman Premier heavyweight, 5 tins Beeman Crow Magnum hollowpoint pellets. Absolutely beautiful rifle, arguably the most powerful piston gun made in the world. (actually a gas ram) Hand fitted, and as accurate as a rifle of this type can be. Oh a nice 6 x 18 low parallax air rifle scope with a 50 lens on top.    2) Theoben SLR 98 Left Handed - .22 caliber, 3 tins of the Premier again, 2 tins of either JSB Exact or Webley Lazapels, 2 tins of a H&N Super Point, 3 tins Beeman Crow Magnum pellets. A gas ram repeater! With a little magazine, 1 hole groups to 40 yards with no wind. Again an absolutely beautiful weapon.    3) Beeman R11 MK II - .177 caliber. 3 tins H&N Wadcutters, 3 tins Crossman Premiers, 2 tins H&N Superdome, 1 tin Crow Magums, 1 tin H&N Superpoint. Perfect field target rifle. Fully adjustable stock, 1000 fps for range. Excellent accuracy, scope this baby up and start picking off daisy stems.    4) Feinwerkbau 600 Jr. Left handed - .177 caliber: variety pack of wadcutters to see what shoots the best. This is a world class Olympic style air rifle. Several gold medals to its credit. I would scope it up and use it for super precision plinking. See if I could shoot bees off of flowers. That sort of thing.    All of these are high end. But, you're saying I only get one? I vacillate between these 4. There are tons of other great ones. I have a preference for spring piston/gas ram type of guns. Someday I hope to add ALL of these to my collection.    Thinkingblade|`|fUDlbOP0aa	crosman 1077 with that paintball air tank option  its a double action type airgun and with so much pellets I could have a good deal of low power fun with it.|`|TPZwmQK9aa	I like my RWS Model 34 in .177.  It has been my experience that as long as the pellet fits correctly, the difference among the different varieties is negligible.  While my RWS will not shoot cheap Daisy or Crossman pellets well (they don't fit tightly enough) it shoots any and all RWS pellets I have tried.  No matter whether they are match grade, hollow point, pointed, whatever, they all group as tightly as I am capable of shooting.  When I shoot a squirrel in the head or neck with any one of these pellets, it dies instantly.  Therefore, it is my conclusion that, at least for me, pellet selection is not an issue.  I buy whichever RWS pellet is cheapest.  As for "just how good" this combo is, I can only say it is 100% "good enough".  I can hit a nickel at 20 yards off-hand time and time again (with my 4x by 40mm scope) and have never failed to kill anything I've shot with it on the first hit.|`|0TuWYaneaa	I use Crossman pointed head pellets.I've found that they fit my gun's accuracy the best.I tried the hollow points by crossman but they tend to spin off target.So do the regular flat head pellets.There pointed heads are more bullet head shaped and they just always hit in the same place my sights are set.All the others only hit half the time.I also tried some pointed beeman pellets and they were okay but still not as accurate as the crossman.I have a break down air rifle that shoots 1000 fps.Its a Shadow made by Gammo.
caecd9e3d614f2b68ccbea2108f571efaa	Here you go, you will need to know the weight of the pellets in grains.  Power is a subjective term. Even if the .22 has more kinetic energy, the .177 might penetrate deeper.    http://www.10xshooters.com/calculators/    Click on the Bullet/Shot Kinetic Energy Calculator, and you might want to save this site to your favorites.|`|Cy6LzAwMaa	Yes. The .22 cal pellet is heavier and stores more energy. Hopefully someone will come along and share the appropriate formulas required for determining the specifics.|`|TPZwmQK9aa	Generally speaking, yes.  However, it would depend entirely on the mass of the pellet each one was firing.  Power, or Energy, is measured in foot/pounds, and is a combination of the speed of the projectile and the mass of it.  While you could theoretically purchase .177 cal pellets that were high in mass, and .22 cal ones that were very low, and come out with the .177 being equal to or more powerful in ft/lbs of energy, this would be an unlikely scenario.|`|13a572ca0d3be8e642296344ce06dd2caa	I don't know, but let me ask you this...    Which would you rather have if you needed to shoot an attacker?  A pellet gun, or a .22 caliber?|`|0TuWYaneaa	For small game the 22 has more knock down power which means its more deadly inside of say 75 yards.Its a bigger pellet and will cause more damage up close.The 177 has more penetration because its smaller and faster. The power to both is about the same because it takes the same amount of pressure or foot pounds to send a 22 at 800 feet per second as it does a 177 at 1000 feet per second.I have seen break down air rifles that have both barrels.The 177 is a 1000 FPS and the 22 is 800 FPS.This is coming from the same gun.Its made by Beeman.
Z8UV6S3baa	Crows are actually a reasonably tough target. They also are intelligent and fairly crafty about cover and such. So, with even an air rifle you are unlikely to get closer than 15 - 20 yards from one to get a shot if you do this regularly.    According to a couple of websites, you are generally going to need at least 4 - 5 foot pounds of energy delivered at the target. So that means you need an air rifle that is going to carry that kind of energy out to probably 40 yards to give you are reasonable range.    So, armed with this knowledge there are a number of options for a combination. At a minimum you probably want to look at a magnum class spring piston air rifle. Some classic examples are the RWS Model 48, Beeman R1, Air Arms TX200, all are excellent candidates. These are all running about 15+ foot pounds of energy at the muzzle and can be had in .177 caliber.     If you are hunting crows, and are running one of the air rifles above, then you are going to want at least a domed heavyweight pellet to carry maximum energy to target. One of my favorites is the Crossman Premier, but Beeman H&N Superdomes are good to. If you get into one of these rifles the best bet is to get a sampler pack and try some different pellets to see what is the most accurate.    Now, in this class of air gun and on a target like a crow, you are going to want some glass on your air rifle, probably at least 4 power, I have a 6 - 18 variable on mine.     These are the basics. .177 gives you the best option of pellets, and there are plenty of choices in magnum air guns in this caliber.     If you want to get a bit more aggressive you can move up in caliber from there, .20, .22, .25 are all relatively common in spring piston type air rifles. Generally, these will also carry more power than their equivalent rifles in .177 because the heavier pellet retains more energy on target.    Personally, I shoot a Webley Tomahawk in .22. It is a 20+ foot pound rifle at the muzzle and with Beeman Kodiaks is still carrying 8+ foot pounds at 50 yards. I have put down cold Jays and starlings out to 50 yards with both head and body shots running Crossman Premiers or Kodiaks.    I have bought gear myself from both straightshooters and pyramidair and find their sites informative and with good selection.    Good Luck,    Thinkingblade|`|EGe0k8P6aa	If you wanted to shoot crows with an air-rifle and want to cause lots of damage while retaining accuracy, look at something like the Airforce Condor in .22 caliber. It handles a wide range of pellets, delivers high velocity, and its extremely accurate.    As for the question of legality... that's something you need to ask your local game wardens about, before you go hunting.|`|TPZwmQK9aa	This would be illegal.  Believe it or not, crows are federally regulated migratory birds, and therefore cannot be taken with a rifle.  Both pellet guns and BB guns are considered rifles.  Sorry, but you have to use a shotgun.  Be sure to check your local regulations as well.  While the Feds limit crow season to 124 days, states can further restrict it if they wish.|`|fUDlbOP0aa	oh no, not another shooting crows with airgun question!    crows first, are peaceful animals and very much like a big family, if one gets hurt they all go down to help that injured crow.   second, crows mean no harm and they do no harm towards people. They don't crap on people's cars (like pigeons), they are not territorial, they don't sing loudly all night (like mockingbirds), they do not make excessive levels of noise (unlike most song birds).   So since they're peaceful and do no harm to you, you shouldn't shoot them.     However, if you have a grudge against noisy song birds or pigeons, then go ahead, kill them all. I hate those too.     Another point to bring up: airguns are great for paper and that's about it. if you wanna kill something humanely and not shoot it a dozen times buy a real gun, like a .22lr rifle an use subsonic ammo if you don't want to make too much noise. the .22 rifle is generally cheaper and more powerful too.

4950a38055e3a23487ed7959fc7378b5aa	Generally they are called the manager or something like that.    But yes, you would be in charge of getting splits for the runners.  If you choose to do this, make sure you talk to the coach and pay attention.  Different events want different splits.      The most common mistake is on relays, people will split how long a runner holds the baton (hand off to hand off), that is not the proper split.  The split is taken from when the baton crosses the relevant line.    Good luck.|`|xGLyp2TOaa	yes, you record the times everyone on the team is running, you can also record splits for relays and races|`|cKXZOLJSaa	yeah. we have two stat girls.

iO12Vjnvaa	The history. To me it is so fascinating! And I love to see long standing records fall, history made, history repeated, and history shattered.  It's neat how Nascar history often repeats itself. I am mainly into the facts, the figures, the averages, to me it is extremely fascinating!!!!  I like the fact that it basically started in my back yard with it's roots in moon shining of all things. I think NASCAR is fan friendly, exciting, and good clean family fun!!!

I like seeing the drivers I dislike have a bad day or even better a DNF.  I like to see the drivers I root for win!  I like the drama between the drivers.  I like the fly-overs and the National Anthem. I like how shiny and pretty the cars are.  I like the history behind all that is NASCAR.

Nn4BgpmCaa	OMG!!! Yes, thank goodness someone agrees with me. I have totally been saying this the whole. I mean it is one loss, but Rog still had a great run at AO. Also, he has won 8 hard court majors, and Rafa won one. In total, Rog has 13 slams and Rafa has six. It kinda weighs out, if you look at Roger's career it is pretty self explanatory. Roger is the better player! Heck, he is the BEST!! I don't like this. If Roger wins the next major, will everyone call him the dominator again? It's strange. I think that Roger is defintitely the best of all time, and Nadal is not even close. LET'S GO ROGER!!! :)|`|1mKJFfieaa	I agree...I didnt read that one that you mentioned but I remember a website saying that Federer has lost his touch or something like that...If he wouldve won they wouldve been saying something else...I dont like people like that...But that was a great match and both player did a great job....And Rafa was very humble when he won and said his speech...Both are great tennis player and I dont like hypocrites...Grrr!!!    lol    =)|`|6kzzxD9naa	Roger Federer have dominated the ATP tennis for the greater part of the last four and half years, and he seemed invincible,but then Nadal who is widely acclaim as a clay court specialist,came along and had beaten  him in six finals of grand slam finals ,even on Federers' favorite surfaces- grass and hard court. i guess thats why the critics are forgetting so soon that besides Pete Sampras who is now retired, Federer holds almost twice as much titles as Nadal. And only time will tell if Nadal will win as  many grand slams as Federer did, or even surpass him.The sad reality is and Federer also realizes it is, that Nadal has become his Nemesis just as Federer himself is the nemesis of Andy Roddick(my favorite player no matter what)  The sad reality is that 'what goes up must come down'. that of course does detract from Federer's achievement, he is a great player.|`|DEDmq2OWaa	I agree that the media has seemed to bail on Fed- unfairly- he has always been amazing and incredibly impressive with his game- the proof is in the record. However, the truth is that no one has ever challenged Fed- until now! Rafa is hungry, motivated and talented-  he never quits, always wants to improve and stays very honest and humble- what's not to like about that.. Especially in sports.. Good grief- it is refreshing!   I am truly a RAFA fan- and want him to keep winning them all- As far as Rafa resembling Sampras that's is incorrect- Rafa is much more similar to Agassi-- never say die, never quit...|`|xLyNsywiaa	I don't agree but it is looking like that isn't it? Right now Nadal has improved his game on ever surface and has beaten Federer on every surface in Grand Slams, I still think Fed will regain his Wimbledon crown though and it might be Nadal who he gets to beat to win it...|`|Qx70ZJx1aa	Federer himself commented on it. Just in the AO itself, they said he was washed up when he squeaked past Berych but then made him the prohibitive favorite to not only match, but blow past Pete Sampras because of his easy victories over Del Potro and Roddick. One should only make judgement calls at the end of the tournament, if not year. He is  the second best player today and probably the best in the modern era even though he is a slam Shy of 14 (because of his 3 consecutive Rolland Garros finals). To say anything otherwise, is just based on emotions and not facts.  That said, I do agree that Nadal could out do Federer's slam record (whatever it may end up to be) if he stays healthy till the age of 30. He is a physical beast with steely nerves, boundless determination and a freakish game. I haven't seen that combination yet in the modern era of tennis.|`|gP7IB2XCaa	I know-its pathetic. tennis reporters are really stupid.   Nadal is great-but roger deserved more credit than that, seriously.  But-it will be a sweet victory o prove them wrong when he wins  14|`|B8Gwxo1laa	I think you're right.   Tennis.com has some of the worst analysts around,by the way.|`|AA12050428	I think the critics just jump on the bandwagon, Federer could just as easily have won the AO  it was five sets, what a different story it would have been then. I am sure he will be around for a while yet. I hope so 'cos he is a joy to watch.|`|9hC7bbf7aa	After every Slam event, the same story. Remember when Djoko won his 1st AO Slam title last year ? And Federer won the US Open consecutively for 5 times last year ? The same thing happened. Yahoo tennis site was all about the winner for a long time. That's why there were high hopes from the media and Roger himself to equal Sampras record ... Nadal was under the shadow. Yes, Federer is the best player on ATP tour presently, as Nadal plainly said to the press. Roger is still young with immense drive to win more Slams, and he will do so. But Rafa has collected many fans, so the tale will go on for a while, but it will stop.|`|U7BkuEU9aa	Okay...first of all, let me tell you that I completely ADORE both Fed and Rafa not only for their amazing talents, but for the incredible people they are. Still, when they're playing, considering Rafa was the one who got me interested in the game itself and not just the players, I gotta say I'm 100% Fed and 120% Rafa. I wish they could both win always, but since they can't...    Having said that, what's undeniable is that Fed is one of, if not *the* most complete, best player the game of tennis has ever seen. He's still young at 27 and a half and he's faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar from done. The problem is that there seems to be a voice in his head that keeps saying "You can't beat Rafa! You can't beat Rafa!", so what I think he needs is to get a good psychologist to work on that more than anything. Plus seems to me his problem's with Rafa and Rafa only - he may have had a few motivation problems last year (at least that's what it looked like to me), but he's definitely still the guy who can thrash anyone, no matter how young or how much of an up-and-comer they are (that 6-3/6-0/6-0 victory over del Potro was SCARY), as long as they're not called Rafael Nadal Parera.    You can't get too mad at the press though 'cos it's not worth it. you're right to say that if he'd won the match he'd be called the best, people would have said he came back for good and all, but that's just how things go unfortunately...|`|pddwVjALaa	I agree....      I still think Nadal will dominate,  but i REALLY do love Federer. People are unfair to his losses and his emotional being.   It is not fair.  Even all time best players can cry or  be number 2 for a while!      FEDERER WILL ALWAYS BE IN MY TOP 2!|`|ipznrSQyaa	I think that Nadal can win more tittles than Federer it will not be the best. The points that make Federer, never Nadal will do it. Federer is the best and will be the best. He will beat Nadal and beat Sampras at the same time. He will win the Wimbledon and be the king of UK.   Federer Forever|`|WxOVH3eMaa	I totally agree with u,I feel exactly the same........|`|o2WdAKZbaa	All I have to say about that is wait until both of their careers are over. I would bet my life savings that Nadal will not win as many slams as Roger or Sampras. I predict he will have a couple more great years and then someone else will dominate the next few years. There are quite a few young up and coming players with a good chance of being the it boy they love to praise as the next best player ever. I wish they would quit comparing the players of today with the greats of the past. It's a whole new style of play. Just give each one of them the recognition they deserve. PERIOD

And he won the Busch Clash (Budweiser Shootout) in 1995 and 1997. So along with his 81 career wins in points races, I believe he has 91 wins all together in the Cup series entering 2009.

jf0UV1Bjaa	being a scout/sniper youre trained to take precision aim and waiting for the perfect timing to make your shot.  When shooting dove or clay pigeons its all about reflexes and simply pointing to the target and pulling the trigger and not taking aim.  Most of the time if you take careful aim at a moving target with a shotgun, youll miss.  Youre trained to aim small and tight, not to take pop shots.  It would take a lot of practice to get you to loosen up with your shooting.  If you think those sporting clays are hard to hit, try rabbit hunting where you kick them up yourself.  Dad always told me never to shoot a rabbit thats not in motion.|`|caecd9e3d614f2b68ccbea2108f571efaa	You and I would make a good team. I can swing a shotgun pretty hard, but I can't make a 100 yard rifle shot without a telescopic sight.    Try to think of it this way- Rifle shooting is a science, shotgunning is an art.    Not that one or the other is better, just apples and oranges. Keep shooting that shotgun, you will get better at it!    EDIT: THANK YOU FOR HELPING TO KEEP US SAFE!|`|AA12034449	clay shooting has made me a better pistol shot.    It forces you to learn to lead targets... follow through after the shot and a host of other skills.. and you will learn to shoot with both eyes open.    If you guys were just slinging birds ....some folks sling em way to fast and it's pretty hard to learn the basics.    go to a regular skeet and trap club...     You may be a scout sniper... but from what I am seeing the Army just doesnt invest the time in marksmanship training they used to. I dont have a lot of 'military' training and I can still outshoot both the infantry kids we sent to the army.|`|elOeLQTpaa	I love shooting clay pigeons. I have no sniper training, or any extensive fire-arm training other than basic hunting safety. Its just a matter of two completely different styles or shooting. With your background I'm sure with some practice you could pick it up and get pretty good at it.|`|0TuWYaneaa	Its all in what you've practiced the most.With shotguns and clay pigeons you have to lead the target a little differently than you would a moving target with a rifle.The more you practice the better you will get.Once you figure it out it will get easier.Your military experience in no way means your a better shot than her Dads.You may be able to out shoot him with what you've  trained with but your in his back yard now.Keep practicing your leading the target is the answer.|`|vea6mqPZaa	Your aim is in the wrong place    Shotguns to not keep a tight pattern.  You need to go get a big cardboard box with a 2 inch tall by 4 inch long black sharpie mark on it and shoot it from about 30 foot away to see the pattern. Aim as if the black spot was a clay.    You will notice a big hole in the center of the pattern. this hole is where it sounds like your placing the clay.    You need to either lead more or less depending on which side of the shot ring your hitting with.    In rifle you have to be dead on, in shotgun you actually have to aim to the side, above, or below to get the shot to hit is target.|`|UidC9N0Caa	lol!...im an 12 year old girl and usually hit every one!!!....haha!!|`|o0ZTqSvaaa	The shotgun may not have fit you. If the gun doesn't fit right your shot will not be hitting where you think it will. I am 5 foot 9 inches in height and most American shotguns are made to fit someone of this size. I shoot fine with shotguns out of the box. If you are much shorter or much taller you will have to be fitted in order to get good hits on clay targets.
AA10297143	I tend not to use the word "suck" much, but they are definitely not very good.  No room for them in the playoffs this year.|`|1yuUIN9Aaa	They have great players on there dude!  Halladay  Rios  Overbay  Wells  They've got a lot of potential!  By the way they were only 3 games behind the Yankees.|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	They dont suck, they have holladay right?|`|mcE9C06Saa	The Jays are great, and mister Yankee fan above who said the Jays suck. The Yankees only had 3 more wins then the Jays last year. And the Yankees have 10 times the pay roll as the Jays. So what does that tell you?|`|Kh4p4gPXaa	First,   its Roy Halladay,  at least spell it right.    And yes,   the team has fallen on tough times in recent years,   and has the misfortune of being in the toughest division in baseball,  but that doesnt mean there are not bright spots.        They had the top pitching staff last year in MLB,   leading in Team ERA (and bullpen ERA),   Complete games,  Runs (and earned runs allowed).   They also finished 2nd in hits allowed and 6th in walks allowed (1st in team WHIP).    I hardly call that "sucks",  in fact,  many teams (Yankees and Red Sox included)  have said how much they would love to have Toronto's pitching staff.    Yes,  we lack a bat,   but he also have the best defensive infield there is when they are healthy and together (ive seen Aaron hill make outs on ground balls down the first base line for god sake,  and McDonald can make unbelievable plays look routine...  the range here is unbelievable).   Add to that the top defensive CF in the AL (he isnt spetacular,  but hes all over the field,   and makes difficult catches look routine).   Rios has a cannon arm,   decent speed and range,   and his bat is coming around.    We wont win the division with this team,  yes,  but its far better than some of the teams in baseball.   Unfortunately,   the american networks tend to focus on Boston and New York,   creating a sensation that they are not any good.   If this team had real exposure,   Halladay would have 3 cy youngs,   At least half a dozen gold gloves,  and some entertained fans.    But hey,   we finished ahead of boston with half the payroll a couple years back.|`|WV5cwIoTaa	No they dont suck it is the injurys|`|xG6sznSiaa	I'm a Yankee fan, and yes I do think that they suck. They do not belong in the AL East as with the O's and are an embarrassment to Toronto. They are a great AAA team at best. Now that Burnett left and Vernon Wells being injury-prone, the only thing going for them is Roy Hollladay.
xGLyp2TOaa	physiologically speaking you have two types of muscle fibers, fast twitch and slow twitch. and actually those groups have become even more defined as sub groups of each over recent years.    But primarily fast twich has a predisposed amount that sets your "natural" ability to run fast and jump high, things like that.  Theres another type of fast twitch muscle that is considered a Neutral muscle.  This can become either a fast twitch or slow twitch, however the change is permanent so once it becomes slow twitch you cant get the muscle to re-convert.    Now with that being sd your typical HS cross country runner doesn't run nearly enough to make this a concern, but i would not advise running more than 50 miles a week as a sprinter as then you are probably doing more harm in your sprinting ability than good|`|TfbR1IFIaa	Ya i think its possible, but hears the thing. A great sprinter has to be extremly fast, so thats why after they run a dash they seem more tired. A distance runner can run for a very long time, and preserve their energy, thats because they have control speed, which is why a distance person isn't as fast as a sprinter. So in order to be both, you must balance your speed, and energy at the same time. Try to be more quick without getting tired.|`|l1p5M0Q8aa	i have been doing sprinting 4 three years. then i did distance for one year.    your body has trouble with your breathing pattern and energy length.    you would need to train and get yourself motivated before you start.    TIPS!!!- if u feel something hurting, stop for about 1 minute, then start running again. if it still hurts, take a 10 min. break. never run on a empty stomach.|`|giANBdAOaa	I dont think its possible for you to become a great distance runner and not lose sprint speed. Your leg muscles are made up of two different types of fibres. 'fast twitch' muscle fibre which you develop with your sprinting drills for the short explosive power and 'slow twitch' which is more efficient for long distance. If you do a lot of distance running you will re-train your fast twitch muscles to behave as slow twitch. You'll get better at distance as your muscles adjust but it will reduce the fast twitch available for the sprints. If you want to keep good performances in both you need to train for both. Even then I think you are going to be balancing the result so you wont be as good a sprinter as you could be, nor would you be as good a distance runner as you could be. If you want to reach your potential you should focus on one or the other. Good luck with the training :-)|`|60c1c3cd65f0c9deb7c8cdbb1a06ba1baa	I'm a sprinter who sucks at anything over a 400. Even by the end of the 400, I start losing some form and techinque.   Doing sprints and long distance is completely different. There are girls on my track team who are amazing long distance runners (GREAT xc runners), but once they try sprinting, their form gets really sloppy. Long distance runners pretty much only have one gear in their minds, and they learn to keep about the same pace for the whole way. When they switch over to sprinting, they have trouble with picking the pace up. They struggle with accelerating and aggressive arm drive.     I would advise against doing long distance and sprinting at the same time. If you want to go for more mileage, just do this. Sprint a 50-100, then jog a 50-100, then walk a 50-100, and do it all over again.

The real problem with the DH, call it anything you want but it is not a position. Position players play on the field, not the bench.    Back to the real problem,  is that it is a miserable failure. It was created to stimulate the attendance of the American League by supposedly increasing scoring. Just look at the results of last season's scoring and all previous years except the first one (1973) and you will see that the average American League team out scores the average National League team by .2 runs per game.   1/5 of a run per game.   What does that mean?   It means that the American League has some pretty shoddy hitters hiding in the 7th, 8th, and 9th spots in their typical American League team batting orders.  More scoring! Hah!  32 more runs per season isn't even a blip.  I, for one, would like to see the pitchers hit in preference to those weak sisters "hitting" in the bottom three spots of the typical American League lineup|`|2N6oTOLQaa	GO Chipmaker GO!    Like it or not, the MLB is going to sit on the fence on this issue forever. The bottom line is there are advantages to both sides, especially when you look at the game from a purely business perspective (which is what all major pro sports really are). By having one league each way, they can please both sides of the argument without alienating any customers (I mean fans).     If you like seeing the pitcher hit, then there are plenty of NL games available for you to watch. Even if you live in an AL city, there are inter-league games where you can see your local team play by NL rules.|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	Never. It creates an extra position, thus the Players Association will never agree to doing away with a starting player(who earns a starting player salary).|`|R0sfdiNeaa	The AL unfortunately will never get rid of it!|`|XxG9SqYoaa	The DH is always going to be there.    DH  Instant Replay    The games changing, you don't have to like it, just get used to it.|`|12JCF1Wkaa	I agree you make a wonderful point! I was never a fan of the DH I think baseball players are hired to play the game and just standing in at bat is not really playing the game to me. Thank God my favorite team is on the national league!|`|Cn1tSHLpaa	Take it or leave it, the AL is never going to do away with the DH.  I can see the rationale in that the pitcher is usually a sure out so why bother making him bat (also, the pitcher is in on every play so does he really need to bat?)...but I can also see your point, if you play, you bat (also, it keeps pitchers from being too aggressive since they'll have to stand in the box, too).|`|mcE9C06Saa	Yea I agree- the Red Sox could put David Ortiz in Center field. lol.|`|tvuhGTD9aa	And, what, the National League doesn't provide enough games?    McDonald's sells hamburgers AND cheeseburgers. Dammit! Don't they know that that only confuses consumers, and that cheese on a beef sandwich is an affront* to diners around the world? Why cannot McD make up its corporate mind and get back to making burgers the way Nature intended?    ----------  * Ask your local rabbi if he would eat a cheeseburger.|`|AA11435575	Chicks dig the long ball|`|5xIroQjMaa	The DH is a ridiculous rule, that promotes 1 dimensional players that don't even bother learning how to field. Just like golf is the lazy man's sport, the DH is the fat man's haven. Could you imagine a tub like Ortiz run around the outfield. Or even stretch for a throw at first base. He'd probably rip open his pants the first time he moved.     That said, Baseball is full of crazy rules, and they'll likely never change this one. AL fans will continually think they're better because of meaningless games like the All Star game (which is a laughable joke). Meanwhile, it will prove to be meaningless since the AL and NL are split 5-5 in the last 10 World Series. (the only record that matters). And fat men everywhere will celebrate because they can get millions just by spending their lives in the batting cages with a rack of hot dogs nearby to fuel their 'power'.|`|oOVAbKPmaa	I dunno, but I wish that if they plan to continue to employ it, they'd do so in both leagues. Otherwise, do away with it. Personally, I don't like it. It takes away from the strategy of the game, which has always been a big part of baseball. Besides, with the money they pay managers these days, they should be forced to earn as much of that pay as possible. The DH makes their jobs easier and simpler through the elimination of double switches and other moves they might have to make if the DH wasn't in place...|`|39d2f170b7ab29e80de1d05e4c44248baa	First of all... Joe Morgan is a complete moron who makes a career out of pointing out the obvious (obviously this is mere opinion)...    Secondly, The DH rule is only used in Professional baseball, where people pay to see games. How many people really want to pay to see Roy Oswalt (just threw in a random NL pitcher) at bat? If we were trying to keep the sport in it's original fashion, ground rule doubles would still be home runs... Games evolve, especially when they're appealing to paying customers.    Finally, MLB will never "do away" with the DH because it gives more marketing opportunities and results in more money which is what MLB is... a business.|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	It's never going away so move on.  Joe Morgan is the worst announcer on television.|`|fh9QBfXpaa	go tell that to edgar martinez.|`|B5BWocvZaa	who wins the all-star game almost every year?|`|IYqcD03Jaa	never|`|T9vs3asQaa	The DH is AWESOME and having your pitcher bat is crazy. Why would you have someone throw a baseball at 90 MPH at your multi-million doller pitcher instead of someone that can really slam the ball. It makes watching baseball more interesting
qusKbEmBaa	Because they arent noticed as much, maybe next year  if they start going on some win streaks and become more  popular they will get the spotlight and be on ESPN more  often. And yea the Yankees are overrated and they didnt  even make the playoffs and people still talk about how good  they are. Hope i helped.!  ( i need the points so i was wondering if you can vote me as best answers, thanks )|`|XpKY04Tnaa	21 million fans verse 3 million fans. I love the Cardinals and can't wait to get the season started. I think they get respect within the league and fans. The East Coast media is so basis against all teams that are not New York or Boston.  When ESPN Baseball tonight gets started this season watch the clock. I've timed a total of 17 minutes out of a 30 minute show of nothing but Yankee highlights. When they were done they went to the Red Sox for 3 minutes and all the rest of the league got 20 seconds.     Somebody needs to take ESPN to task about their crap coverage of the rest of the league.|`|5xIroQjMaa	The Cardinals are in St. Louis. I mean, besides Budweiser, they're the only thing in St. Louis worth talking about. All joking aside though, the entirety of our country's media is either in New York or California. If your team does not exist in one of those two areas, no one is going to care. (Except for ESPN and Boston. We all know how there's definitely a romance between the two. Is anyone as sick of Chris Behrman as I am?)|`|iPLg93Qmaa	Cause' They lost.|`|fSX8Ie7caa	I KNOW! I'm a Cardinals fan!|`|lBhkWpDoaa	the mid-west is not a media capitol|`|3Iyu7hrcaa	The Yankees have 3 times as many titles as the Cardinals.    But what "credit" are you looking for?  I've never heard anyone say anything bad about that organization.    You want coverage?  Then win some games.|`|yqC51KXOaa	They are probably the historically best national league team. presently they arent very well noticed because they are kind of a normal team. one star, a couple average players, 1 or 2 below average starters, a decent rotation. The two things that get them the most recognition are albert pujols and the bullpen. They should get more credit, i agree, but not if they lose these games because of blown saves and terrible setup men.|`|3cd675f8a0783955763670d5ea211808aa	If the Yankees are overrated, then what are the Cardinals? You talk about history, but the Yankees have 26 World Championships, the Cardinals 10. You do the math. I think LaRussa is one of the all-time overrated managers. The guy's been managing since 1979, and he has TWO World Series titles, despite having great teams in Oakland that should have won 3-4 of them. He did somehow manage to luck the way to the title in '06 with a measly 83 wins, but I guess mediocre teams slip through the cracks and win occasionally.     LaRussa a class guy? Yeah, it was real classy a few years ago when he was passed out drunk behind the wheel at a stop light. Maybe he had a few too many Budweisers!!  It's real classy to ruin relationships with so many of his players, like Scott Rolen.    You go on whining and crying about your poor Cardinals not getting "credit". I think you are just jealous.|`|c6q3EERdaa	It's true. The Cards have the 2nd most WS titles in the MLB (10), and they have a great history. It doesn't make sense to me how they don't get a lot of credit for what they've done over the years. ESPN doesn't really help with the East Coast bias, but these days the Cards are talked about less than teams like the Angels!|`|wFsE6eqiaa	true... true...|`|D8OzQwXKaa	st Louis doesn't have the history the yankees have
kGXU1Dotaa	Stop trying to make' Paper Tiger' the new happening word its not happening little girl,***,queer, $sshole|`|zMvGnlMraa	I dont think a team can ever be 'has beens' since the makeup of the team changes every year.  You could say certain players are 'has beens' but it just doesnt make sense to call a team has beens.  Yankees will win another WS in the next 5 years.  And its better to be a 'has been' than a 'never was' like the Red Sox are.  (that totally goes against what I said,  I know)|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	Paper Tiger?

Most Definitely. Go BOSOX!|`|5xIroQjMaa	Completely. Been saying that for awhile, and this year, they're gonna get beat by the scissors lizzards out there.|`|Id4OLpIZaa	Lol. I never heard of "Paper Tiger" before. Anyways, I'm not really a yankee fan, but i have to disagree. I believe the term "Has-Beens" refer more towards an individual or organization who has no chance of succeeding (no chance of winning...ever!).     However, the Yankees do have a chance of winning. Especially with all the money they're spending. They could win the world series this year, or perhaps 100 years from now (like the cubs). Who knows.     Lol. I hope your right.|`|geih5vR8aa	Still a force to be reckoned with? They always are a force, because they throw away $190-200 Million every year. And they still find ways of losing. That's not a good franchise.    But NO, I believe that this year they got some quality players. They just still like to throw away money and look like they're hot ****. It's just so funny when they lose. A team like the Yankees, or even BOSTON, should win 130 games a year.    What the Hell is a paper tiger?|`|2n6HSiF0aa	you are absolutely right. they have enough world series titles. why dont they let some other teams live the dream.|`|WaaFCtuOaa	Not me & if you think the Yankees are has beens, what is your team, "never was".

This season will be a statement year for the Yanks, trying to prove to idiots like you that their still a force to be reckoned with.|`|u3TeIQoZaa	well that is obvious because they havent won in what 9 years...that basiclly answers your question. Also the red sox are going to be the top dog for a long time.|`|X9fo1IkKaa	If that's the case then why even bother talking about them ?

AA11610448	If you want to make it to the Olympics, I would find the best coach available.  But, just because the coach is an Olympic swimmer doesn't mean that they're going to be any good as a coach.  Talk to all 3 and make them watch you swim and provide you feedback on where they think they see you and what you could expect from them.|`|A57LMS5Qaa	if your that into swimming, i dont think price matters. just dont spend 100,000 dollars on a lesson or anything. its your opinion and choice how much money you want to spend.|`|dCjbwLKLaa	my swim team is about 120 a month thats monday, tuesday, thursday, friday and saturday for 4 hours each its hardcore. im not going to the olympics or anything i just go to a competitive swim team in south florida.|`|V6asuaxuaa	I'd suggest talking to the coaches of all the teams and see how they think the season is going to go, what are the strengths/weaknesses of each team, and how you'd fit in socially and in terms of what kind of swimmers they'd need (distance, sprinters, relays) - this will help you know how much you'd be swimming in meets. Once you have that information, weigh the pros/cons of each team against how much it costs. You might find that you're going to get the best experience out of the least expensive team or that you really belong with the most expensive. Of course, also weigh the financial commitment overall - if it's too expensive, it's just too expensive. In the end, as long as you feel like you're having fun and developing your skills, then you're in the right place. Good luck!
iSCANwkAaa	A lot of times Middle School volleyball is all about learning the sport and preparing for high school and club volleyball, show I'm sure that if you show some sort of good starting point and potential, you should be fine.    It also depends on your school/area.  I know where I live, Volleyball is REALLY big, so not everyone makes the team just because they have that potential.  Even if you don't make the team, you should play for like a rec league or something so you can get better.|`|Jsvz996Baa	if people said u did good look at that side don't let those kind of things get in your way.|`|VEScnfoHaa	That same thing with the preppy girls goes on at my school too. There's the preppy girls who try-out just to be on the team and supposedly show off to the boys that they have "skill" and then there's the girls with real talent. If your coach is fair and just, then she will pick every person possible with skill, instead of considering their social status. I wouldn't believe what the people are telling you that the coaches only pick popular and preppy girls. Don't pay attention to what everyone else is saying and focus on what the coaches want: real skill and talent in their volleyball players. As long as you did your best and have real skill, you have a huge chance at making the team.|`|GypxAAEAaa	yea if youv played before and are at least okay at volleyball then youll make the team. Dont focus on whether they pick the popular and preppy kids because you ll be able to laugh when the team sucks. Good Luck and dont stress.|`|jWQNrs3Aaa	Don't worry the preppy kids won't get picked if your better :) I'm sure you'll do fine, and NEVER give up!|`|x8Pf5fmFaa	if the coaches and some other people said that you were doing good and you did your best you'll probably make the team.   oh and don't worry about everyone else.   don't let that bother you
HkwUGOmxaa	I did answer your question about wax I think. The people are great! Fun...downtown is awesome at night, some good entertainment and pizza spots. The mountain is ok...but the park is great. There are some incredible locals there and you never know what pro you might see so pack the camera. If you drink you will want to go into town and I would try and pack  snacks with you to eat on the chairlift as food on the mountain and in the lodge can be expensive. Although it is some of the better food that I have had. the weather is usually warm. I live in colorado and it can get colder here. Pack stuff you can layer with and have a back pack so you can lose layers and have someplace to put them. Bring 2 pairs of goggles as snow can be wet and get inbetween the lenses. You will want to switch them out every other day. have some regular gloves and a back -up spring glove maybe. Bring warm weather wax...floro. incase they get a warm spell. It can get a bit slushy. You need to prepare for everything. They get a lot of snow then....and a lot of sun. You never know.|`|nRYVWkpEaa	Well, I went late April, and I lovedd it!  the snow was pretty good, though there were a handful of runs weren't open, but I'd imagine that during this time it would be amazing.  The area is also incredible.  Especially at night.  Grab an ice cream cone and walk around main street.  It was sooo much fun.  Plus the people are nice so it's good.    And I beg to differ with the guy above me lol. (sorry...haha)  I thought the mountain was GREAT!  I was more of a beginner at the time, but I loved their runs, and they had a lot of natural stuff to hit, like going through trees, stuff like that.  Lots of runs for EVERY level.  LOTS of runs lol.   That's all I have time to say for now, but I hope you have fun!   I loveddd my stay there and reallyyyyyy did not want to leave.  I want to go back sooo sooo bad!  You're lucky! haha, okay, I'm done...bye:)    **EDIT :: by the way...another thing regarding the weather.  We were there for I think 5 days?  (one spent at Snowbird) but, the first three days, it was really warm and sunny, everyone in short-sleeved shirts, and it smelled like suntan lotion/the beach!  it was amazing lol.   but then the fifth day I went out with my Dad again...it snowed sooo hard.  My gloves were soaked within minutes.  Plus, I've always liked to go fast, and the snow was pelting me in the face like little bullets...yeah, we went out when there were huge wind gusts and it was snowing reallyy hard.  So DEFINITELY bring extra EVERYTHING!  like the above answer...you can never tell exactly what the weather is going to do.  it was insane that last day...anyway...again, hope you have fun :)

Towards the end I became exhausted but completed it through sheer obstinacy. The thing I would have liked most was a candy bar in my back pocket.

vj6YpJn8aa	If you can truly run for 30 minutes straight then I don't think your conditioning is going to be an issue.  I would try to work some sprints into this 30 minutes.  It doesn't have to be that far but just enough to work your heart rate up some.  Most importantly, I would try to get involved with as many "pick up" games as possible between now and the try outs.    A short-sided 3 v. 3 game is a great way to work yourself into soccer shape and doesn't take many people.  Take a ball and practice driving the ball into a wall and receiving the ball upon return from the wall...mix in some moves with the ball too.    Good Luck!|`|Tt5Otlx8aa	well it really depends on how bad or how good in shape you are right now. if your not badly out of shape then i say about 2 weeks of running should be fine. you could run for lets say 17 minutes and then sprint for the last 5 minutes. after a week you can increase the sprinting time and lower your jogging or running time.    good luck. and hope you make the team =]
TPZwmQK9aa	While not "recommended" you are not likely to do any harm to the gun.  Hornady is just covering their behinds.  The idea that it could be fatal is ludicrous, which is why you see that first answer getting the thumbs down.  If it were my BAR, I wouldn't hesitate to try it.  You can get other brands of ammo that produce just as much pressure as the Hornady LMs, and the gun doesn't know the brand.|`|iRKV3j6Gaa	YES!  the BAR is made for 30-06 rounds (7.62x65mm)...anything less or more could prove fatal.  less powerful rounds might not, but it could still damage the gun itself...dont do it! only use rounds made to be fired from it.|`|13a572ca0d3be8e642296344ce06dd2caa	Probably.

0MOXObjkaa	Hey the same exact thing happened to me I was on travel a couple years ago and I loved my team and we moved up and alot of them were bad so I decided to stay a season we actually did better than premier but them my coaches moved up to coach premier and they took me up with them and felt bad about leaving my team but if what your looking for is to get better and get more experience go to the premier team seriously and if your just looking to have fun and not serious about soccer then stay with your friends, good luck:)|`|bTT7ML6Aaa	last year i was on a team that was ok, but not that great, i had a great coach who had been my coach for a couple years. i wasnt really happy with it and felt like i needed to be playing at a higher level, so i moved to a club that a had to travel an hour and a half, and didnt know any of the girls. it worked out great though and it was the best decision i could have made, i had such better training and team commitment, and now were ranked like 40th in the whole US!|`|bRoC9HCjaa	You need to stay with your team. If you don't have much talent, then you need to step up in a sortof captains role, and lead your team, an dbe a great player.
oPbLcfKoaa	Kabuki is a good old name. It was C. Itoh previous to Kabuki and then was folded into the Bridgestone brand.    Kabuki made a full line of road bikes from klunker-heavy to quite light for it's day (around 22 pounds). They even had a model called the Submariner which had a stainless steel frame... that one was close to 35 pounds easy.    The thing that set Kabuki apart was the way that they made their frames. The tubes were set into a mold and the lugs were CAST around the tubes... no brazing, no welding and they were among the strongest joints ever. They weren't the best looking things in the world but they were effective.    Be aware that such an old bike- particularly with the frame construction method- will be difficult to upgrade. Most of the technology on the bike is obsolete and as such is not readily replacable by any modern stuff.
DOVbF4Piaa	Don't go to Walmart or any department store, they sell junk.  Here are a few sites with low cost bikes.    http://www.beachbikes.net/index.php  http://www.chubbyscruisers.com/  http://www.bikebuyers.com/beach_cruiser_...|`|LTd3uKoDaa	mickey y u r an idiot, now to the question, you are best of to go to your local bike store (lbs) and talk to the peoples there they will make sure that you get the bike that is the right size for you. Alos should anything go wrong with the bike they will be able to repair anything.|`|8THbk2PCaa	If you're looking for something you'll have fun on for under $150, I don't see anything wrong with going to Wal-Mart. My mom just got a La Jolla cruiser for about $99, and she absolutely loves it.    Just because a bike is inexpensive doesn't mean it's going to fall apart on you; I still ride the Free Spirit 10-speed that my dad bought from Sears during the Ford administration. It still has 100% of the original parts, and it rides incredibly well.
7X6HxaSmaa	There are probably a few other things that would be nice to add.  A sleeping pad or air mattress will give you more cushioning than just your sleeping bag. Putting down a tarp or "footprint" before pitching your tent helps protect your tent floor against sharp sticks and rocks.  You might want different clothes or a sleeping bag liner to sleep in to keep your bag cleaner. Give some thought about hygiene issues. A day without showering wont kill anyone, but if you stay longer you might want to think about your options available. Other extras would include a gps/compass and map if you want to do alot of hiking or camp chairs for a comfortable spot to sit. A light pair of binoculars are a personal fave for desert views, and can do double duty for looking at stars when the weather's right.  As for food, most camping websites will naturally lean away from meat just due to most campers have issues with refrigeration. So while you would probably lean away from some prepackaged stuff the ideas are generally the same. Soups/noodle/rice dishes that you can make with boiling water seem pretty commonplace.    Ps. Its a desert. Don't forget extra water.
c64b55c57d1c97df1d0f7cdd4b322789aa	Baseball gloves are made of leather so water would ruin or help ruin it. There are plenty of ointments and oils out there that moisturize and water proof your glove. I use Hot Glove myself, but I'm sure if you did some research you could find plenty of others that work just as well or better.|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	NO...NO...NO|`|ZKyqU6RDaa	I was told to use water. And no it will not mold. Oil is heavy and will weigh the glove down. Water will soften the glove up, but you should still loosen it up with your hands. Don't just Soak it, put a couple balls in there and tie it up. Make sure you play catch or throw a ball in it yourself.|`|B5BWocvZaa	if you want mold and mildew in your glove. and if you want your glove to be stiff forever|`|OaniQuqpaa	nooooooooooooo never let your glove touch water, i do not care how hot or cold it is it is ok though to use oils and cream that were ment to be used with baseball gloves, and bake it in an oven if the cream you put on say to|`|yT7xNpAGaa	DONT!!!!!!!!!!! It will screw up your glove (such as it did mine) and your gunna have to go out and get a whole new one because you cant fix that. Best way to break it in - First shaving cream all over the inside, then rub it in until you basically cant see it anymore, stick a softball (regulation sized) in the palm, and tie a belt around it. leave it alone for about a week or 2 and then the comfort will just come with a little bit of catch. Also it will leave your glove smelling great for a year no matter how dirty it gets! :-D

UHv9xjcaaa	When you breathe in air your mouth and throat warm up the air so your lungs will not freeze. When you are walking around your body can do this very easily. However, when you run, you breathe so quickly that your body does not have enough time to warn up the outside air. Because your lungs are receiving cold air you get a burning sensation. Your body will eventually get more efficient at warming the cold outside air and this will go away.    This has happened to me a few times, and I sometimes cough constantly for half an hour afterwards, and my throat feels hot and raw. This will go away after a few times out. Don't worry.|`|DcEBhY02aa	Because your body and lungs is not use to the cold air intake. It will get better overtime.|`|cKXZOLJSaa	You're not used to that cold air suddenly rushing into your lungs.  Try to cover your mouth if its too bad. breath through your nose also.|`|l1p5M0Q8aa	because you are using up too much body heat too fast and your body can not re-heat fast enough.    dont take my word for it tho. i just guessed.

kQSSz2X2aa	It goes by the Wal-Mart pricing theory: if you make a LOT of anything you can sell them very cheaply. There were so many of these rifles stamped out that they are super-cheap. Also, the Soviets (who made a good chunk of the Mosin Nagants out there) were very good at figuring out how to manufacture stuff without needless frills so as to bring the cost down as much as possible. There were also a bunch dumped on the market in the last 20 years. The Soviets weren't about to sell Americans arms during the arms race, and after the Soviet Union collapsed there were a ton of Mosin Nagants sold to America. This throws the supply and demand off kilter and makes them really cheap. They are great rifles, and dirt cheap too. I saw one at a gun show once for $55 (and that was last year).|`|OAEuYZkZaa	None have been made in over sixty years.    There were millions of them produced between 1891 and 1945.    Their fit and finish is rough at best.    They were made with virtual or actual slave labor so the original cost was very low, even by the standards of the day.    Doc|`|U0Rvsabdaa	The most mass-produced rifle in history.    They are great bang for your buck.    Try for a Tula.|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	This has happened in the past on many occasions when some country decided to dump its old surplus rifles on the market for cash. That probably has a lot to do, for instance, with Lee Harvey Oswald's choice of the Italian Carcano. The reason the Nagants are so plentiful right now instead of earilier is that (1) there are an awful lot of them and (2) the Soviets weren't big into selling on the American market in years past.|`|nooi0ldjaa	they cost so little because there's so many of them!    and they were not made to look pretty. does NOT make them a bad gun though.|`|EGe0k8P6aa	The fact that the Soviet Union made about 37 million of them between 1891 and 1965 and that following the fall of the Soviet Union they have been widely imported into the United States might have something to do with the low price. After all when there are a lot of items of a given model released into the market they tend to reduce the price.|`|vea6mqPZaa	100 million made  100 thousand sold    Not sure the exact numbers but they made a LOT of them and are just now selling them.    Ammo is rising in price for them, so if you get one I would get a case 880 rounds of polish heavy ball and a case of silver tip light ball.    I consider the recoil to that of a 30-30 lever action or a 303 British    aimsurplus.com will sell one for 79.95 with the best of five pick    some are just plain worn out some are in great condition|`|jf0UV1Bjaa	the mosin nagant was the soviets military issued standard rifles.  They got upgrades on their guns and they kept the mosin nagant in their armory because they wouldnt sell guns to america(cold war and the soviets just had a stick up their ***) and then they sold the guns to us in such large numbers that its not worth anything.  supply and demand.

I have a Polish MN made in '63 that Is the best quality that I have found.|`|mqalvNWfaa	Because there were roughly 34 million made between 1891 and 1970 ( yes, the finns still made then in 1970 )|`|965ctggXaa	Well the Russians made lots of them for one thing, but they're great rifles. I own a 91/30 and an old sporterized one, and I love shooting both of them. I think the Mosin Nagant maybe my favorite Milsurp gun to take down to the range. They're a real bargain!  Hope that helps.
MPX0f5jzaa	I wouldn't count that as cardio because it requires short bursts of energy much like lifting, therefore anaerobic.    I can't run either, but I like to do a good 30 to 45 minutes on an elliptical machine first.  It's easier on tne ankles, the knees and the boobies (shake 'em if you've got 'em).    I like how you're only 30 but you use the phrase "at my age".  I do that too and I'm only 34.  Can you imagine how hard it is for our parents?|`|TuOp3hNPaa	ya this should do real good. i wish i had a heavy bag but i do have a speed bag an i get a huckuva workout on it. hitting a bag is a good replacement of running|`|Lj2gskP9aa	After years of working with athletes from every sport, I have found that working with MMA guys is the hardest.   Yes hitting the bag or punch-mits will replace cardio, BUT do you think you could actually do that for 30-40 minutes straight?  Thats the reason boxers/mma guys do runs and also the other things they need to do, bag work is usually done in small spurts of time.   I had one MMA guy that we did punch-mits while on a treadmill.
TPZwmQK9aa	Bass Pro and Cabela's both have good cheap boots on sale right now.  Only certain sizes are left, but if you look around on their stores online, you'll find some that will fit.  I have two pairs of good, cheap boots.  Both are Rocky brand, and I paid half price for them.  The idea that good boots can't be cheap is silly.

XMXuJSPWaa	Here's the link.    http://www.myvideofight.com/video/ufc/gs...|`|sLVGdCOTaa	Here's where I go to watch recent fights, mmaroot.com, (had all of the main fights from ufc94 as recently as yesterday, might have to scroll back a page since new updated fights will bump them back) also try cagepotato.com, mmascraps.com, bloodyelbow.com, if nothing on there you can see many many old fight from almost anyone you want and other odd hard to find stuff.
nRBC4E5saa	First fight could be between Frank Shamrock and Igor Zinoviev at UFC 16 (ended in 22 seconds) or between Tito Ortiz and Evan Tanner at UFC 30 (ended in 32 seconds).  There is nothing in the current rules prohibiting a slam, so this could happen again.    Second fight was between Gary Goodridge and Paul Herrera at UFC 8 (ended in 16 seconds).  This might still be allowed under modern rules so long as the elbows are not directly downward.|`|FKhY6EVAaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFC_1    All the others are here too    UFC.com offers them for a fee, Dailymotion.com might have them|`|dSmoB64Yaa	I'm not sure exactly who did what, but the best way to show him, would be to use an online rental sevice like Block buster or Netflix or just buy videos online. Try to locate UFC 1 to UFC 5. At first, there was very little that fighter couldn't do. For example:     There was a no biting, no eye-gouging rule and that was about it. Hair pulling, headbutting, groin strikes and fish-hooking were frowned upon, but allowed     No gloves or padding of any kind was required    No weight class. Fighters could outweigh other fighters by hundreds of pounds.     In UFC 2, Time limits were dropped. Groin strikes were still allowed, but they couldn't grab the genitals.    In UFC 3 The referee was officially given the authority to stop a fight in case of a fighter being unable to defend himself.    This gives you a little idea of how bad it could get in the early matches|`|P6NzCumHaa	Your first hint is kinda vague.  Search youtube.com for "Top 10 MMA slam knockouts".  It's probably in there.  If not, I'd venture what you'll find is pretty darn close to what you're looking for.    The second fight you are looking for can be found by searching youtube.com for "Goodridge vs Herrera - Judgement Day".|`|6a3172c489600c432a5b3ecd4bc4bb96aa	Sure...    First fight you are looking for is I think is Dan Severn vs.Anthony Macias.. where he suplexed into a stupor with two big slams. He finished up with a choke but it he was pretty much out.. (two slams happened about a 45 seconds into the match, he subbed him out at 1:45) This occured at UFC 4.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJmpBhWCb...      WAIT WAIT I KNOW!    You mean Frank Shamrock vs. Igor Zinoviev at UFC 16, he slammed into a KO in about 22 seconds of the first round. That is the earliest KO via Slam in the UFC I believe...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEbrSavLL...    The other one you are definately talking about was stated above.    Gary Goodridge vs. Paul Herrara at UFC 8.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuZCGDS51...    Hope that does ya!|`|NJMzhcKhaa	First fight will be  Dan Severn vs Anthony 'Maddog' Machias.   Severn suplexed Machias twice and then pounded him.    Second Fight  There are two possibilities.   One is Gary Goodridge against Paul Herrara    Two is Remco Pardoel vs Orlando Weit
AA10232540	Yes, they can and often do fit right from the box.    I've used real Mossberg parts, the stock and forearm, a heat shield and sling swivels etc on one of my nephew's airsoft guns.  I've used real Mossy parts to build my niece an airsoft Serbu.  I've used airsoft parts on paint guns etc.  I've used real AR parts on paint and airsoft guns.  All it takes is an eye to adaptation.    All it takes to use an airsoft or real part is to match the size of the item the airsoft or real part was designed to be used on.    If your barrel is too narrow, which would be hard to find these days, you can use a short length of appropriately sized PVC pipe as a spacer.  Cut the length you need, Dremel a slot up the side so it can be compressed etc.  You can use scope rings, with that PVC adapter, to mount rails to skinny .22 barrels etc.  Slide the PVC adapter on, mount the scope rings *around* the PVC and then mount a rail to the rings.  Some rings today even come with their own rails designed in.    You'll find lots of those clamp on mounts for rifles and shotguns today.  The leapers and UTG stuff you mentioned.  Those will fit easily....they can be adjusted to fit just about anything....but they're so damned big and chunky and sharp-edged they snag everything and they look like crap.  Too tight and you risk bending your barrel, too.  Use thin wall PVC tubing instead.  Like above, cut your length but don't slot it, leave it solid.  Heat it a bit to soften it and then slide it down onto the barrel to where you need it.  When it cools, it'll seize in place.  Spray it with some black paint for the tactical look.  Use screws to mount a rail to that, instead, and you'll be rock-solid and look good doing it.  If you want to remove it later, use an X-acto to slit it.  Use the PVC tube spacer method and you can get all those cheapo airsoft parts to fit.|`|6f36240af8847ca83ec28b5f2b425b32aa	NO you can't.  unless you are willing to duck tape them on.|`|iqNcXWsOaa	I don't think so.

CBVlu3Gvaa	Only suggestion I have is for you to hit them both and see how each performs for you...thats they only really valid criteria anyway.|`|sBrummATaa	i personally hate taylormade so i would go with callaway|`|ldwaVRy4aa	I have a Taylor Made r580 xd.  It is a 460cc and it sees to me to be better than the burners.  Do you like your fade? if not just get a stiffer shaft on it.  I through on the biggest Winn grip i could find and It has excellent feel.|`|ayLYuIvOaa	depends   tour burner is what i use and i like it  im freshman playing for highschool  you should look at taylormade burner 09  i think its pretty good  also nike is alright  mostly depends on your feeling and the ball flight that how you like it  if you want good ones prices probably from 250-500 depending on which and where you get it|`|4b3332df8190c2f3c7712f9c840cba13aa	It really depends on which you like better. You should go to your local range and hit them both and see which one you hit better. Also, if there is a local demo day you can go to that and test all different kinds of drivers and may find one that is better than those 2 mentioned.|`|kT4I3C6caa	Dont buy a club until you have tried them.  Go to stores and test them, it's free! There might be other clubs than these twoi.  Good Luck!|`|LX0EOsCHaa	Ive hit both and they both hit the shi t out of the ball it depends which one you can hit straighter and looks the best to you so i would go and hit them both on 3 consecutive days just in case you swinging like crap one of the days. I also believe shafts that fit your swing play a bigger part too|`|GNNh52OMaa	I used a penny to randomly pick a club for you. what I did was put a "t" on tails and "x" on heads each representing taylor made and callaway respectively.      pick is: taylor made|`|CkGPAdiDaa	It all depends on what your comfortable with. Fading a little bit is the sign of a fair shot and you want always want a driver that makes you comfortable, if you aren't comfortable with you driver you will almost never be able to hit a decent shot because you are so psyched out about your driver. I'm on the middle school girls golf team and my drive averages around 250. I have a nice solid swing but my driver ain't nutn special. The reason I nail em is because I TRUST (thats the hole key in a good driver - its being able to trust in it)  in my $100 wildcat driver. But if I was going to have a preference to a specific driver it would be a Taylor Made R7. The adjustable weight system is awesome. The big benefit of that is that if you are playing a course that has alot of doglegged holes then you can adjust your weight that way you can exagerate that hook or fade.   * Hope I helped
Cl6KbcAGaa	Not much difference here between the two. As listed on Shimanos web site the Alivio is the lowest component group they support and Deore is the 2nd just above Alivio. The difference is negligible but Deore is slightly better overall. Most lower end -mid range priced bikes come with the Deore group. The whole point in having gears is to use them to your advantage, even on the flats...try them you will like them!|`|oPbLcfKoaa	The Deore is definitely the better derailleur if you are using 8 or 9 speed. I am pretty sure that the Deore cage is too narrow to use a 7 speed chain, so if you go to 7 speed then Alivio is probably going to be your best bet.    Alivio had a facelift for 2009 but they are pretty difficult to find except as original equipment on new bikes.|`|ed1e958a74b3aff1204376a3d8dca2a2aa	i have used both and it would have to be the Deore my wife has alivio on her bike and it sucks but she likes it so she wont let me buy her a new one.|`|9FidnEvAaa	What is your bikes speed, 8 or 9?

923854b9668ce66f1bf78d6cf66c9daaaa	Here is one way to go about it.  Find an NRA club in your area and attend their gun/hunter safety course.  Get your mom or dad to attend it with you.  This will show your dedicated to safe firearm/Airsoft use.    Next, make a list of ground rules that you will follow.  They should included: using eye protection, following all Gun Safety procedures as learned in class, places you can safely/legally play, etc.  Agree that any violation will result in suspension of your airsoft privileges.    Finally, let your mom know that Airsoft will: increase your physical fitness, agility, coordination, and teamwork skills.  Far better than sitting on couch watching TV or playing video games.  Best of all organized activities and hobbies reduce the chances that you'll get into drugs or alcohol.    Good, luck and remember to respect your mom's final decisions.|`|AA10034285	I'm afraid your mother is right and you are so wrong. There are only two reasons for guns of any kind and that is for killing and maiming, and there is quite enough of that going on in the world without you adding to the total.|`|bf677ad1559cc6457484de35230a3c4baa	this one is easy...    your going to have to find evidence to prove to her that airsoft is an actual sport, sit her down show her some press releases or some papers from online...    then explain to her you have stress and you want a positive outlet to relieve your stress and that is airsoft, you just want to go to a field and play airsoft with people and run around all day.    explain to her you dont want to vandalize ****, or be immature or shoot your self.    then finally say this     "OK MOM YOU DONT WANT ME TO HAVE AN AIRSOFT GUN AND MATURLEY PLAY THE SPORT, I WILL JUST DEAL DRUGS IN SCHOOL, START SMOKING CIGARETTES, AND DOING HARDCORE DRUNKS WHILE DRINKING ILEGALLY THAT WILL ALSO RELIEVE MY STRESS"    hahah you got this its the truth|`|Hrm071Rlaa	ok so heres the deal mom. airsoft isnt a bad thing. it is technically a sport. i doubt that hes going to go to a shooting range but its completely safe to just shoot it around i the backyard. if you are thinking i just dont understand what is the point heres the answer. the point of it is to be able to shoot something. it is always appealing to boys to be able to do that. as long as you trust your son that he will not do anything bad with it i believe that a person over the age of 12 years old can have one.I dont no how old your son is but i confident that he can be responsible with some like this ever as i have stated earlier is is not something that can be harmful if it is used in the correct manner. also its not really that harmfull. yes it can really screw up your eyes but thats just about it. and the solution to that is to always wear protective glasses!! besides that it doesnt even hurt to get shot especially a pistol. an airsoft gun is the least harmfull gun besides nerf guns.|`|kgbDAwJRaa	I completely agree with Asdak L on this one mom-lady. The guns are simple and effective way for the boy to have fun. And hey, it gets him outside. You just have to talk to your son and trust that he will be responsible with it. Make sure he only shoots at people who are prepared and willing to play with him. The worst that can happen when used properly is he gets a small bruise the size of a bug bite. Just be sure he has safety goggles.    To tell you the truth kid and mother, I prefer parents like you. Kids need to know that although not lethal, these guns are still capable of hurting someone. Parents like you stop the rest of us airsofters from looking bad from kids who are under educated or just don't care and act stupid with them. Its a privilege to be able to shoot these guns and they should be treated with respect.    I say get the boy an airsoft gun. Its a great outlet for him to let out some energy and stay active (which we all know is difficult) Just teach him to be responsible.      Oh little side note, I'm fifteen and have three airsoft rifles, i go out with my friends on a regular basis. Its a good sociable sport.|`|4550e65e3d41f1d4e3d6c42dee113e12aa	How old are you?

iO12Vjnvaa	It's an unspoken rules among the crew chiefs in NASCAR that to stay on top YOU HAVE TO PUSH THE ENVELOPE to win. Jimmie and Chad got caught but have other championship winning teams. You think Dale Sr. and RCR never "cheated"? Richard Petty and Dale Inman??? If you say no then you would be mistaken. Petty and Inman were caught as were Dale Sr. and Kirk Shelmerdine. It's a fact of racing....the champion to me means he/she was the best at getting the most out of their car and the rule book.    Just an opinion as always.|`|88uIjItaaa	But Jimmie Johnson also proved 3 Years Straight he has what it takes to be a champion. I don't like him but I respect the talent he's got and what he's made of. Jimmie Johnson knows Car Control and Knows how to win. 2 time in 3 years he was caught cheating. But he still won the Championship.|`|mTGEeCHaaa	Using that logic, there would be way too many asterisks in use.  There have been quite a few questionable calls by NASCAR that affected the outcomes of races.  Should those race winners have asterisks by their names, too?  If so, I can think of some drivers who should have asterisks in their win column.    Jimmie Johnson's team has been known to cheat.  They are not alone - they just got caught.  They were penalized and fined, they served their penalties and paid their fines.  They still won championships.  Asterisk him if you want.  JJ's a 3-time champion; no matter how you slice it.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	Every team caught in violation of the rules is punished by NASCAR as they see fit.    And to compare using drugs and "tweaking" a car is a bit ridiculous.|`|mIdcJEJNaa	Whoa, hold on just a cottin pickin' minute there..    First of all Jimmie was not caught cheating, his   crew, or more specifically his Crew Chief was caught  stretching the rules a bit..  Second of all, fines were paid, suspensions levied, and  points were deducted from the owner, and from Jimmie  (even though he didn't do anything wrong himself)...  The points loss alone is almost the equivalent of missing two races..  And working without his Crew Chief for all of those weeks was  another handicap he didn't earn..  Anyone who can suffer that kind of point loss, and still win   the title, should have no problem holding his head up, and  has earned the right to call himself Champion without having  you call him a cheat..|`|XNdDrXAzaa	what's an asteroid going to do.  wait a second...  What was the question again?|`|OdUZRBRtaa	when did he get caught cheating and for what????|`|E5mFWOqqaa	Probably because, in those 3 years, he was still given stiff penalties (having to run 15% of the season without your normal crew chief and a huge fine and a points penalty) and still was able to overcome the penalties.    Plus, remember what he was penalized for. The only thing that was bad was at Daytona the year he won it (2006) and then was top 2 for like 4 of the 6 races Chad was on suspension. In 2007 Chad and Letarte were penalized for doing something they thought was legit to do- adding padding to the fender of the car at a road course.     Plus, you can't blame Jimmie for cheating. Chad Knaus would be who you could blame. Also, remember that all 4 HMS teams share chassis, so anyone else that used that chassis would also be fined- wouldn't they?|`|YHYT8qMKaa	I don't think there should be any comparison to NASCAR drivers and baseball players. And I really don't think the  48 team cheats. Chad Knaus got suspended for things that happened during the 2006 Daytona and 2007 Sonoma race weekends. NASCAR took action and Jimmie had a new crew chief for the race. Even if that was cheating, Jimmie earned his 40 wins without cheating. As far as I'm concerned, Jimmie Johnson has never failed post-race inspection. He's not a cheater; he's just plain good.|`|739f14d79f8285fdffb364bed6c305feaa	Come on...in every sport there are folks that do wrong and push to see if they can get away with it.  NASCAR is no different than the football player that doesn't get caught dopping or diving, Hockey there is high sticking and faking a tripping, Baseball you have spitballs & sandpaper.  IF they get caught they pay the penalty just like the  48 paid for theirs. There is a saying "Cheaters never win" but there is another saying "if you aren't cheating you aren't trying".|`|UYKNpI2Xaa	WOW....I must have missed something. Jimmie got caught cheating twice in his third championship run?!! NOT....In fact Jimmie had NEVER been caught cheating. It's pretty rare that any of the drivers get caught cheating. Most of the time it's a crew chief, or other crew member. The 48 car has never failed a post race inspection. You should get your facts straight before you ask a question.|`|tTVS5oYzaa	Might want to check facts before spitting off something ridiculous as that.  The 48 team did not have a single penalty assessed to them during the 2008 season while winning their 3rd straight championship.  Here is information on who received off track penalties last season.    http://www.jayski.com/pages/penalties200...    Chad Knaus has gotten in trouble for pushing the envelope of the rules in the past, but he is hardly the only one doing so.  With the competition as close as it is, teams are looking for anything to gain that slight competitive edge.  Sometimes the overstep that fine line and NASCAR makes them pay for it.  The best example from 2008 was the team that finished 2nd to the 48.  Carl Edwards and the  99 team were assessed a 100 point penalty for a the oil tank lid being off at Las Vegas.  Every teams has pushed that line at one point or another.|`|muc8sq9naa	Comparing drug abuse with mechanical infractions is like comparing apples to pistachios!  Not even in the same ballpark.

AA11225694	This is my favorite drill. It works on accuracy.   1. Line up 12 to 15 yards from the goal post.  2. Snap the ball and try to hit the goal post.  3. See how many times you can hit it in a row.    Repeat Snap Drill      This drill works on the release point and accuracy.  1. You need about 8 to 10 balls and 2 helpers or 1 helper and a backstop.  2. Have the balls placed in front of you in a line the way you like to grip them.  3. Snap the first ball.   4. Have your helper place the next ball on the ground in front of you positioned the way you like to grip the ball.  5. Snap the ball as soon as you get your hands on the new ball.  6. Repeat with rest of balls.   7. The 2nd person will catch the snapped balls. Or the backstop will stop the balls.  8. If your snaps are consistently straight, then you have a good release point.   9. If your snaps are not consistently straight, work on your follow through with your hands and fingers pointing back at the punter    1. Place several balls on ground in front of you.  2. This is not like the repeat snap drill.  3. Make sure you have the proper approach, grip and stance.  4. Snap each ball as straight and as far as you can.

fz77R5Jmaa	definately Gasol and KG because i think if Gasol can stop him or make it difficult for him to score it gets into KG's head maybe lowering his confidence   last time LA played Boston KG was on fire so he needs to be slowed down    we will have to help Fisher if the same thing happens as in the finals last season cuz Rondo did whatever he wanted with Bynum out     but i think its more important to keep KG contained|`|b0eYeLG1aa	pau soft  fisher is old u do the math|`|o6KAdVUSaa	RONDO VS FISHER    PAU SUCKS|`|wXxJUnLJaa	Gasol and KG!|`|IAnT8aGsaa	Gasol and KG....

FZwhX62Xaa	It's a strange one and a bit of a "So-what?" story after all this time.  In any case, regardless of what team you support and whether you like them or not, we have such as Miller (11) and Faddy (13) who have got goals at international level, not to mention Boyd (4?) if he ever comes back, so maybe we're not too badly off.|`|57rbgBw2aa	He would have scored goals which is more than can be said for that rejected bottle merchant Kristina Boyd... at the highest level like.. ken whit a mean 'n' at bluey?|`|23533728e2015c47fbaedd308257bf8aaa	Well tie my kangaroo down.|`|BdiQPKn0aa	I'm glad he didn't play for Scotland    Scotland for the Scots|`|euZRbiA2aa	To be fair it was all ways Australia he was wanting to play for.Think he turned down Smith an all.Not many people about tonight.|`|AMTIwdQ2aa	Couldnt give a crap to be honest

kgbDAwJRaa	At average range (15-20 feet) with a decent gun it will hurt a bit. On bare skin it may leave a small welt. Otherwise though on t shirts and other clothing, it wont hurt much but you will know you got hit. And yes. It does. Unless they knew he was doing it ahead of time. If they didn't then I suggeast you tell him not to.     People doing stupid stuff like that is what makes the rest of us look bad. It seems like fun at first, but then someone gets hurt and the first thing people say is "Hey he hurt someone with an airsoft gun. Those are bad." Save the rest of us a lot of trouble and advise him against it.|`|AA10056762	Yes your boyfriend is a jerk. Its people like him that are ruining our sports reputation. Jerks like that who don't give a crap about gun care, sportsmanship and safety. Its a shame he is putting us all down.|`|yqC51KXOaa	depends on the feet per second rating for the gun. also how far away u r. but if its not from 2 feet away and not with a 500 fps gun and not on bare skin, it wont hurt much.|`|GlHHz1ehaa	Depends what kind of gun it was. (Feet per second)  It also depends how close he was. You can get really hurt if you shoot someone at point blank range with an airsoft gun of any FPS.
VghVdPfsaa	It's called a double steal. It doesn't happen that often, although I do not know an exact figure.    For the team stealing, the obvious risk is both runners could be out, although if executed correctly, it should work or only one runner will be thrown out. For the team on defense, the run could score and if the throw is bad, the runner on second can score.    Ideally, the third base runner should stay a couple feet off the bag untill he sees the ball clearly being thrown to second. For the team on defense, they should fake the throw to second, and then try to get the runner on third stuck in a pickle. At least, they will get one out and a run won't score.|`|5EuOTAjJaa	It is called a delayed steal. The runner on third usually never leaves the base until the catcher actually starts his throw to second.  Watch it carefully, and you will see it for yourself.|`|RteBwg8laa	sometime happens i been to alot of game and i hav seen i a few times but someone normally gets out but bout dont not of wat i hav seen|`|5xIroQjMaa	It's called a double steal, and is done most often in that situation. Generally the guy on first breaks for second, while the runner on third holds to see if the catcher will risk a throw. If he does, the runner will break for home. Usually however, the catcher lets the guy on first get a free pass to second.|`|JWu1exdQaa	the better choice would be to fake a throw to second and then throw it right down to the third basemen and get the runner in a pickle!    it happens alot    On my fastpitch team we just ignore the runner and let them steal because we know they are gonna run on that pitch, it must have worked because we were undefeated! :)|`|mqgS6Dfxaa	If there is A runner on 1st AND 3rd he must have very long legs.|`|8sqOVMvNaa	Double Steal  happens all the time  but usually you see the runner on third breaking for home the catcher will hold the ball either get him on a run-down  or tag him at the plate and let the runner on first just steal 2nd    the risk is either 1 or 2 outs  catcher holds the ball get the runner thats tryin to steal home, catches the runner running to 2nd depending if he is fast or slow in a run-down  thats would be two outs|`|OaniQuqpaa	this happens a lot. until you get to high school baseball it is smart just to hold onto the ball and let the runner take second base. once you are in high school baseball and beond then the catchers and 2nd base/ shortstops arm is strong enough to throw it down, get the runner out at second, and throw it home and get the runner out at home.|`|PdiXPNKmaa	There is a very big risk for both teams  if the catcher throws, the runner on 3rd can run home  if the pitcher cuts off the throw, they can throw back home and catch the runner    its a risky move but i would ty it
AA10498235	Media taken it to far.|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Im a Knicks fan and I am 100% satisfied w/ both the performances of my Knicks. We stuck w/ it and stayed in the game in both games. Knicks were actually robbed in the Cavs game cause when it was a 1 point game w/ 1 minute to go Z took steps on that 3 and Knicks had momentum who knows what would have happened.    The individual performances of KB24 and LBJ23 are jaw dropping and even though I am sickened by the fact Knicks fans called KB24 because no one should ever say that to an opponent I respect both of them for their games.    You are just mad cause you are a Wade fan and the Heat are not better than the Knicks and Knicks own D.Wade and his Heat. Not only did we win this year against Miami. But, Miami and D.Wade are 0 for their last 10 against us. Not to mention we have won the season series for the past 3 years even the year you won a title. Knicks own D.Wade and Miami and we will continue to do so.|`|jHJ0W9QNaa	i never understand why the media is always trying to portray the Knicks as a "storied franchise." they only have a .500 winning record and two championships in their entire history.|`|fKedbYR4aa	It's only because MSG has been there for a long time.   2 records broken there in one  week.    Basically, If Kobe Bryant scored 61 at Dave and Emma's Cow farm, they would overly cover it on ESPN.     anyone could score 61 on the modern knicks. all they need is a basketball, and an oath to not pass it more than three times per quarter. Which is clearly something Bryant is good at.|`|lBhkWpDoaa	This time of the year is slow in regards to sports news    ESPN digs up what they can, it's your job as a knowledgeable viewer to recognize this|`|m501HwyWaa	i can see u dumbass kids are out of school...i was on here earlier and no sign of kobe this or that anywhere on yahoo in the early morning, since now school is out for the day instaed of u kids doing ur homework u go straight on the computer and ask away|`|WLXFAeSnaa	Because both Kobe and LeBron had great games there.

rseD4OG2aa	Three guys jump to mind right away, Mr. Kennedy, MVP and Shelton Benjamin.  Mr. Kennedy has had the worst luck, but he's, as the cliche goes, a main event waiting to happen. He's great as a face and as a heel, he's one of the best in the business, right up there with guys like John Cena and Triple H, in terms of mic skills and he has that rare ability to really engage the crowd. You can see whenever he cuts a promo, regardless of whether it's as a face or as a heel. The crowd just does whatever he wants them to do. He can really funny and serious at the same time and his promos can often be better then some guys matches.   Inside the ring Kennedy is fantastic as well. He's not a brawler or a high flyer but his move-set is exciting and he can set a great tone in a match. Besides, how many guys do you know that can turn a reverse side Russian leg sweep into a really cool finishing move?    I think that MVP is the leading candidate to win the Money in the Bank this year. I'm really liking his current face turn and he's another guy that is absolutely brilliant on the mic. He's very expressive in the ring and on the mic, which as simple as it sounds is a trait that most wrestlers don't have, and he's proven many times now that he's fully capable of working a great program. He's probably the most ready for a main event run. He's done great and long term programs with guys like Kane and his feud with Matt Hardy really brought out the best in both of them and showed that they both have the goods to be the type of guys a company can build around.   MVP's great in the ring and he's a terrific storyteller. I can't wait until he's finally put in the main event title picture.    Benjamin in the obvious answer. It's easy to see that he has true superstar potential. I'm really excited to see his upcoming feuds with Kennedy and MVP. Without a doubt Shelton Benjamin is the best pure athlete in the WWE, if not all of wrestling. He's got a terrific build and he has a rare in-ring ability to pull off memorable moves.   The only reservation I have about Shelton is his mic skills, or lack of skill. WWE keeps putting the mic in his hand, hoping that he'll get better, but I don't know if he will. That's the only, and I mean the only, thing holding him back. I think that he needs a face turn. WWE doesn't let their heels perform exciting moves because the fans would cheer for them so they've had Shelton working more of a ground game, which doesn't really suit him.  Evan Bourne has proved though that you don't need great mic skills to get over with the crowd. Benjamin can perform Bourne-like moves if Vince would let him, and that would be a perfect way to get him over as a credible main event type.|`|J3vufPpTaa	Most-notably, Mr. Kennedy. Had Kennedy not have gotten injured, he'd of been a world heavyweight/WWE champion, by now.    And CM Punk. I believe his last reign was just a brief experience of what's coming for his future.|`|h5K2fcuDaa	MVP and Kozlov both deserve and probably will|`|qUQnsqnsaa	Yo man, KANE needs to be in the main event he earned his spot before John Cena.

oHJ0ZEFqaa	I don't want to get ahead of myself, the season just ended. Plus, saying that he wants to come here and actually getting him is two separate things.

a112fa2d0ccf1099eec1119d4da5e902aa	It would be best for Oscar to call it quits.  He clearly don't have it anymore.  We know that all fighters would like to go out with a win on their records, but a fight with Mosley is an utterly dangerous proposition.  Mosley, despite being older than De la Hoya, is still a tough tough opponent, as we all saw with Margarito.  He still got some speed and ring smarts and obviously has less wear and tear than Oscar.  There's no way Oscar could win against Mosley.  Besides, Mosley is hungry for a second shot at glory.  But as far as Oscar is concerned, it's pretty obvious that his passion for the sport is gone, except but for the promotion side.|`|jHqV6yUxaa	This fight doesn't make sense right now, even though I felt De La Hoya beat Mosley in their rematch. This fight should have been a while ago before he got ridiculed by Pacquiao. Who wants to see De La Hoya fight now?      At 154 this fight will be a little more competitive, but still Oskie will get destroyed.     The guy should retire.|`|jY6cis4Kaa	Maybe I'm wrong, but in my personal opinion, I don't think a third match would be very marketable. Oscar showed terrible effort against Manny Pacquiao and Mosley's fight against Margarito was so dominating. Their respective last matches were so contrasting that it also makes you wonder what damage would Oscar suffer at the hands of Mosley, if they fought again. Also, if really doesn't help matters when, on record, Mosley already has two wins against Oscar. So in an event that Oscar was to upset Mosley, it still leaves him on the short end of their personal series.|`|YlKyUjf1aa	after Oscars last fight i honestly dont think he has it in him anymore, the Oscar who fought manny was an aging oscar at this point if he doesnt wanna hurt his record anymore he should not challenge big name boxers|`|fJCYDSEsaa	No Mosley would dominate. Did you see his last fight.|`|l4WEwTWwaa	No I would not. Mosley didn't legitimately beat DLH as he failed a steroid test right after. It should be a no contest and the fact that it isn't has absolutely amazed me to this day. Next I don't want to see DLH fight period. He has managed to lose every single big fight he has fought and they have been boringly one sided despite charging us a million dollars to watch it. If he has to fight one more time and get that even 40 wins fight Trinidad and avenge your loss. This is the only fight I can see him winning now that Trinidad is beyond gone and will still make money. Next all this Mosley euphoria is only because of his win over Marga cheato. If Margo didn't cheat his entire career he would not have had the magnitude he did when Mosley knocked him out. Mosley is done and the next fight he fights he will lose, mark my words. The Mayorga fight showed us he is only looking for one last big pay check before hanging those gloves up. They both nearly done and only have one fight left in them, but this fight would prove and accomplish nothing. DLH vs Trinidad and Mosley vs Cotto in a rematch and that is all that would make sense.|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	no oscar will win|`|5fabd1dde8996146708da2f18d2feea8aa	Oscar is over the hill and Shane is getting there.  A third fight at this point in their careers, these guys have made their statements and nothing would be gained by a third fight.|`|6QhACK70aa	OSCAR FOOL WON ONE OF THEIR FIGHTS HE GOT ROBBED PLUS MOSLEY IS A STEROID CHEATER GET OVER IT|`|I9Y6fxguaa	Man I don't know, I rather see Mosley vs Pac.|`|Ef4HdzEfaa	Oscar would absolutley  go 0 for 3 if they fought. No i dont wanna see that fight there is no point to it. If they did fight it would be staged because of their friend/partnership. I dont wanna see this fight for the same reason i wouldnt wanna see mosley fight winky or vernon for a 3rd time. That reason being oscar already lost both fights to him... how could anyone possibly justify a 3rd match? Even putting oscar's recent beating he took at the hands of pacman aside as well as putting his age aside. I still would have no interest in this fight.|`|ElH6jMEXaa	Sugar seems to have aged much better, he was always more athletic so its not a huge surprise that he can compete at a higher level because of his superior strength and speed.      In a bubble I think he should be able to KO Oscar in the middle rounds...but in reality these two are very close friends now, and if they did fight, it would be a glorified sparring session with Mosley carrying him for 12 uneventful rounds.|`|LanxzmVdaa	Oscar just simply cannot beat shane.  Shane is faster,stronger..and has aged way better !   And no Oscar did not get robbed in the first round which was clearly a fight he COULD OF won but gave in up in the later rounds.But for now De La hoya cannot beat Mosley.|`|daad940e9bc0b3b1281557caf3a3f195aa	I wouldn't mind seeing a 3rf fight between them. I think most of Oscar's problems against Pacquiao were due to the fact that he drained himself getting to 145 and clearly had nothing left by the night of the fight. Not to take anything away from Manny because he fought a splendid fight, but I just think Oscar going back down to Welterweight took a lot out of him. If Shane and Oscar were to fight at 154 then I'm certain Oscar would fight a better fight because I think that's his best weight to fight at. If they fight at 147 then Shane beats him easily. I actually think Shane was out of his element at 154 even though he won some big fights, but Shane showed against Margarito that he's quicker and sharper at '47. Right now I would pick Shane to win but I wouldn't ever count Oscar out.|`|2k8TEiRtaa	I wouldn't want to see another fight between these two. Oscar got robbed in the last fight. Even Mosley was all depressed as they ended the fight. He thought he had lost. it has nothing to do with anything against Mosely. But look at his demeanor  during the scoring. He is just as surprised as anybody. There won't be another Mosely DLH fight.|`|7domw3t5aa	naa not anymore. Shane's still a A grade fighter. Oscar looked like a C- his last time out. And a C vs 2pound. I think Oscar can still fight i think he just needs to find the motivation to go hard. Bring in that young boy Chavez Jr i think and i bet he go hard!

He was more adapted to the English way of playing than the Spanish way.|`|fLpnC8qtaa	People think a great player can play in any League. That's not necessarily true. I think he went towards the ending years of his career and I don't think he is happy at Barcelona to be honest. I believe the Premier League allowed him to play at potential to his strengths. The Leagues are different. La Liga isn't his bag I'm afraid. Nothing to do with talent at all.|`|iKdQyJh4aa	He's not their weakest link when he was with us we had him in his prime not when he was two thirds past his best. DB10 was our best player ever

Having Henry at his peak position will be better in some plays than C.R. last season.

Ribery could also cost us you know, assuming Bayern will part with him. If Valencia sells and we dont snap him up he will likely go to Madrid, imagine the damage that could do us. Bojan is great but he's got a lot to improve on (his finishing for one, too dicey) and if we win La Liga we need experienced, adjusted players like Villa to defend it,  keep the  title not just for one season.|`|lRotJdEWaa	I agree with the above answer.
LReOvHEdaa	Quaresma is already a flop..|`|nJ5kceMBaa	Arshavin. I'm not at all convinced. How do you get to 27 without playing top club football, if you really are that good? He'll be a complete flop.|`|cOPCNP7Laa	I go against the odds and say Arshavin :)|`|XU1KaWXwaa	lol arshavin|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	RQ|`|HxET88bDaa	Quaresma.....i mean why would Mourinho let him go after paying 15m for him?    Although having said that, he played well under Scolari before and apparently he is one of the only people he really listens to..    Arshavin doesn't seem like the type to rebel etc and will want the best for his team, although for Quaresma this may be his last chance at the big time and he may use his chance..then again he may not..|`|AA11510511	Quaresma will be the biggest flop.|`|xVMQx7dtaa	Quaresma is world class!  Arshavin will flop like a sack of potatoes!|`|9MZ7Gygdaa	Ive never watched Quaresma play but hes a big name.    Ive watched Arshavin since the UEFA Cup Final against rangers, and im a bit annoyed how Arsenal supporters can claim to know what hes capable of. They are all saying how he was never good. True, hes not consistent which would explain his swapping with Zenit's first team now and then, but when he plays well he is class.    from what i know, They will both go downhill really but Quaresma will flop more. :)|`|3zNIeEl2aa	Arshavin is the man! he got talent. Quaresma is just one more...|`|7Xridrxaaa	Quaresma is only on loan. As soon as Mourinho is gone, Quaresma is going with him. Arshavin will do good in my opinion and i am not being biased but it will sure take him some time to adapt to english football but he will get there. Anybody remember Bergkamp? haha he came to Arsenal under the same circumstances and look at him now!|`|N7fNwIQSaa	If Mourhino couldnt get the best out of him....and wanted to get rid of him i cant see Scolari doing much better....|`|Hiasgb75aa	Arshavin.

Arshavin in Zenit also recently did suck.  So I say Arshavin.  hello      Sorry for my English, are Italian.|`|WdOAxQmoaa	wenger never buys flops, only two in the past 11 years,fransis jeffers and reyes.    quaresma has been a flop every where he's been. thinks he's ronlado but he's no where near his class.      which btw,ronaldo as in the best player in the world.|`|n18Q7t11aa	Queresma is already a flop...he cant go down any futher,he can only stay the same or improve......Arseshaving can only go down or be as good as his price suggests.|`|w6lVjQigaa	I'm thinkiing Arshavin|`|qD3QirUJaa	Arshavin will be big.  He is in his prime, has great experience and mentality.      Quaresma is talented, but is selfish.  After a good start Quaresma will turn out to be a flop.

XQoH9ZI5aa	Reggie...........

Great drafting alright, thank Christ for some fortunate late gems because their 1st picks leave something to be desired to say the least. Doh.|`|PwED69Isaa	I am more against tanking than almost anything else in sports. The fact that any team at any level would ever tank is an insult to anyone that has worked hard to play a sport. Competitive sports are all about giving 100% every single game, no matter what. You're gonna get killed? Make it as close as you can. I know you said this in reguards to fans, but this does happen amongst players, and I absolutely hate it.    Now, about the fans.. Yes, I think any fan that cheers for their team to lose is as far from a true fan as they come. I would MUCH rather my team play their hearts out day in and day out and finish in the middle of the pack, then have them lose. This is one reason why I find Cubs fans so great. We take pride in the heart they play with every year. So they haven't won the World Series in 100 years... they come to play every day.|`|uQrIdrjfaa	tanking is an insult to the fans and the sport they pay all that money to watch them give up? I am clearly against it|`|x9GODf8eaa	I guess I am against 'tanking'. If getting a better draft pick is that important, then the Leafs can make a fairly simple trade in the off-season, trading a current player for a first-round pick. This will be part of Burke's rebuilding process.     I would never cheer for my team to lose. Even if the Leafs drop a few spots and jump up a few spots in the draft, is it worth half a season of cheering for a loss. I don't think so. The Leafs will definitely have some good picks, because I think that Burke will be selling off some of the older, fairly valuable Leafs for young players and picks. The Leafs need to rebuild from the ground up with young, hardworking, talented players.|`|FY17j1Ajaa	Tank it. baby! Just wait to do it in a year when a can't miss player is available. The Penguins did just that in 1984 and drafted Mario Lemieux. Turned out pretty darn good, didn't it.|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	Against.  Firmly.    As a fan, you want your team to do well and compete every night.    Look, I'm a STH (seats have been in my family since the late 60's) and so I had to pony up knowing full well this would be a "transition" year.  I did, because you frankly never know what'll happen.    I want and expect the Leafs to compete every night and give 100% effort every shift.  If they lose but do so honestly...I can live with that as the team lacks talent.|`|ks1WIgSKaa	Hey Leafs look at the Red Wings. They pick near the end of the first round every year thats if they even have a first round pick and still draft great. Its not where you draft its who you got in the organization to make those picks. I fell bad for who ever they draft becasuse that player will die in Toronto.|`|AXwJsjQ2aa	By the looks of that game last night the leafs may have already decided to tank. Or maybe the Sabres are just that much better than them.    I'm against tanking, I feel that athletes should always give 100% no matter the scenario.|`|X1yZOMYHaa	You probably should have clarified what you meant at the beginning. Because when people hear "tanking" they assume you mean the team tanking, not fans hoping they lose.    Fans can hope for whatever they want. I right now am somewhat hoping the senators remain in the bottom 5 and have a shot at Tavares or Hedman, now that they can't make the playoffs.    As for teams tanking... I'm deadset against it. But... it's perfectly okay for gm's and coaches to intentionally skate players from the minors, to give them some experience, and in the process lose more games. But players on the ice, whoever they happen to be, should always do their best.|`|a4b1ec29a0974990f99d1acb4a268821aa	As one of the contributers said before (I forgot who) You have to step back before you move forward! Things aren't just going to happen in our favor and it's pretty clear that Leafs are in a re-building mode. This doesn't mean I'm for tanking... I don't think it's right for wanting someone to lose but with the Leafs I don't think they have a team that's capable of winning to be a good team. As much as they try this year I believe they are just good enough be be a bottom five or eight team.|`|yHvh7tFlaa	This season is a difficult one for me, as I really don't want the Islanders to lose, but I want them to get the best opportunity for the first pick. I was kind of relieved their 4 game win streak was stopped tonight. Does this make me not a true fan? No, just a realistic one. The only way this team is going to get better is through the draft. Most good FA's won't sign because who really wants to play half their games in The Nassau Mausoleum.  Let's face facts, they are 21 points out of the 8th playoff spot. Finishing any better isn't going to help them.    I guess I will have to bandwagon for the Avs, Leafs, Sens, Bolts, Blues, Thrashers, Preds, and Kings as opposed to rooting against the Isles.

AA10495394	History tells us that They are just a flash in the pan because only one super bowl loser has made the playoffs the following season since 2001(Seahawks in 2006).

The Cardinals deserve a ton of credit for getting to the Super Bowl; even though they were a 9-7 team that only made the playoffs because they won a weak division (NFC West). The Cowboys, Bears, and Bucs were 9-7 and missed the playoffs because they played in tougher divisions.|`|RZIV15e3aa	They are one hit wonders. Time to go back at the bottom Arizona.

They have great talent, but this season was a gimmie. they had a cake regular season schedule and coasted through it    JTF.....Like your name states, I'm not insulting your team, it's just the facts.  Let's see their next year schedule beefed up and have them repeat their success this year.  Maybe my team will see you in the SB again :) We'd love to prove that our win wasn't a fluke.|`|0ylaEVtraa	they will not go that far never again they was lucky|`|c17x6L4baa	I appreciate the continued disrespect of some responses.  Nothing like fans of teams you beat in the play-offs selling wolf tickets about how weak YOU are.  Check a mirror.  A good laugh though.   It is hard to sneak up on an alert opponent.      If Warner keeps playing, and Boldin(under contract through 2010) doesn't start slacking, the Cards should have little trouble continuing with close to the success they finished with.  SB?? Maybe not.  That is never a given.  But, easily a better regular season than this year if pressured.  If these players are not solidly in place, it could be a looong year.    If there was any need for it, the regular season record could have been better.  Remember, the division was wrapped on a 7-3 start and they often phoned it in from there.  Not exactly a glowing endorsement of that effort is it??|`|cdQryr7paa	It kind of depends on what you define as the "real deal".  Everyone needs to remember that they were 9-7 in the regular season.   They lost 4 of their last six.  Getting blown out by Philly, Minnesota and New England.  They found a way to beat 3 much better teams in the playoffs, but that didn't hide the fact that they could not run the ball effectively.  Part of that problem is they went back to E. James at RB instead of Hightower.  But Hightower didn't help them in those regular season blowouts either.  I think their 15 minutes of fame are up.  If their division didn't suck so bad, they wouldn't have even made the playoffs, so don't look for them to return next year.  After all, they are the Cardinals.|`|2oozKS3taa	If Warner comes back next year and the defense plays like they did like most of the Super Bowl (Not counting the last 2 minutes of the game) they are the Real deal.|`|c6549b3b9001bc49e012be0c7e036bdeaa	Flash in the pan.... those clowns will be lucky to win 6 games next year...

When you make Ben Roth and Santonio Holmes look like Joe Montana and John Taylor, you know you suck....|`|AyFlyjp7aa	I think they will be really good for next year but will not make the super bowl again (if Warner retires, they won't get past the 1st round of the playoffs).

But seems as though they have secured a top 4 position and I'm not sure where.|`|Pfq2zRejaa	more likely neverton winnin it|`|ipznrSQyaa	They have chances but Manchester or Liverpool will win it this year|`|iWOjZcbLaa	absolutely not, premiership is a long range championship, so even if you are good it's almost impossible to win, only top team can win those kind of events, teams like aston villa can win the national cup bc there you don't need to be costant all the year, but just for 1-2 games|`|jM5N09KQaa	NO well not this season anyway    villa are doing well, very well however they lack the spending power and the reputation to bring the type of players needed to win the league i hate to say it but i cant see any team winning the league apart from the big 4 for many years to come! (well mby man city if they do a chel and buy the league)|`|kJhZx5Mcaa	No Chance. They are not good enough.|`|K0TEZbLOaa	No way, its Man U's to lose.  Villa will come 5th  Liverpool also to choke|`|xU7AaQOdaa	They will not win but they should qualify for the CL.|`|lhASsVwcaa	They have a good chance, but not this year, i think maybe next year if they consist there performances up.|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	No, they don't|`|exARv7Bmaa	Not this year and maybe not next year either...but I could be wrong!|`|mK06dus9aa	Nah|`|Qd6sTsogaa	No I do not think they can win. Liverpool or Manchester United will take it. I think they will make the top 4 though.|`|dT3xJ9GWaa	no
yS5f1XLFaa	well it depends. their best stroke could be freestyle will urs could b backstroke or something. im an 8th grader 2 and my times are about the same as urs, but im a breaststroker. also have these girls been swimming longer than you? if so they should b faster than u. dont worry about how fast ur times r, just do the best u can and thats all any1 can ever ask of u.|`|3zR82lwSaa	hey,   those are pretty good times, the better eighth graders on my team range between 26's and 28's on 50's and 58's-1:00's on 100's, but our team's mostly distance so those aren't their best events. and like I said, that's the top few girl, not all of them. depending on how long you've been swimming and if you're really a freestyle sprinter or not those times range from very good to great!|`|4lsRgiyTaa	those are good times,  the only one i'd drop time is for the 100.  thry only taking 3, but even better, 2 breaths for each length...  that really helps!|`|0wwt5oJMaa	yea they're way good. Are those girls on drugs or do they do more training than school work?  : /
dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	It is called self discipline. Do you honestly think that people who have trained for 20+ years really wanted to all the time? The answer is no. The difference between those who become great at the arts and those that are just ok (or suck) is self discipline. You need to force yourself to train sometimes, even when you do not want to.    By doing this you will develop the habit of training and that becomes as normal as walking. If you have to rely on outside influences or videos / movies to motivate you then you are going to fail in the end. Self discipline is the hardest part of being good at martial arts. Good luck.|`|P6NzCumHaa	Think about the last time someone kicked you butt.  Imagine you get another shot at them soon.  Imagine him and all of his friends laughing at you.  That's what does it for me.  Vivid visualization.  Try it.|`|cczy8FfEaa	I hope this is not a very frequent issue. I would suggest finding a routine that helps make learning martial arts enjoyable. I know sometimes it may seem like a chore just to practice. Try making a goal for yourself and make it a personal achievement. For example, if your in traditional form karate, try accomplishing the form under a set time with minimum mistakes. Point sparring? Try different techniques on a bag (if you have one) to change your game up. That usually does the trick.|`|bn8X2YdRaa	well for me what really makes me hyped is someone running there mouth to me.. Especially if its someone im nervous about (like someone way bigger that could maybe take me) but in most cases someone isn't running there mouth to you before every lesson So just watch some fights on youtube or something.. Like some street fights or some really great fighter kick someones a$$..     And think wow.. i wanna be able to do that|`|LUnscegvaa	You've reached Brown!!!    Honestly there isn't much difference from black only one step.    Without boasting at Brown belt I was kicking 2nd Dan Black belts butts in free sparring and judo grappling so its down to your own believe in yourself.    Go the extra mile ,you've come this far why stop now, you can do it.    Btw..My coach was a former Scottish Champion 4th dan in judo and a 3rd Dan in Jiu-jitsu, our club trained hard and realistic in all areas.    Best wishes :)***|`|C0sT0PPyaa	first you have to want to get in the mood to get in the mood to want to practice.    wow what a deserved brown belt    where i come from you wouldn't get past white belt with that attitude....but i guess karate is different|`|Qpx6gCwFaa	Watch some awesome martial arts films, maybe?     That always gets me in the mood.     Here's a sampler:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpNo6L-kF...|`|zoEvwmXCaa	Get a punching bag to practice on and maybe watch different videos.  Also remember it'll get you in better shape.  I'm a black belt and have been for 8 years and am still practicing.  Sometimes I don't feel like practicing but just have to make myself and afterwards I feel so much better and stress free|`|4htyTXJSaa	i think about how if i don't practice, would if i run into somebody and haven't been taking martial arts seriously, then i might get my *** kicked, so practice and you will always be ready for anything and across you wanna stay in shape, i don't want my instructor getting mad at me because sometimes a good instructor can tell if you been practicing or  by the way u perform.    or you can be like the nike commercial, JUST DO IT
4VoQduaZaa	If you are looking at passing only Australia, then we will have to beat Sri Lanka in the last match and then win the series in New Zealand. At the same time, Australia needs to lose to New Zealand and then to South Africa as well. This will really ensure that India will be above Australia.     But since Australia and South Africa are playing each other, it is quite possible that the winner of that series will stay on top of rankings. I don't understand the details of how the rating is calculated, but if Australia - South Africa series runs close and we drub New Zealand, then we might end up on top. But I can't say for sure.|`|cOm8LQ1Daa	India will 've to win the 5th ODI in Lanka & Australia will 've to loose to Kiwis, then only India can surpass Aussies in limited over ratings!    Indians out-played lankans in every match and in every department!

Yeah Pimple Buster I agree with you.    Edit   Regardless of the outcome of the Aus v NZ series.|`|1728e3faa2e928d93180946b2c15295daa	If India win next ODI also, they will replace Australia in 2nd spot.|`|AA11088802	tomorrow winning of NZ|`|f9hiPMDxaa	Quite right, I think regardless of the outcome of the last India v SL ODI, India will pass Australia in the ODI rankings. But, should Australia beat NZ in their ODI series, this would probably see things back to the status quo.|`|RGxMkT0zaa	Just heard if India wins the next Match, they are   2.|`|ocPlxCIeaa	Congratulations INDIA !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

NNn84vTCaa	Mickie 'Alexis Laree' James.     Mickie, essentially, was an Enigma. As Alexis Laree, she was this tough kinda chick, then she was this semi-got grunge punk rock kind of girl in TNA. And now, she is this playful, sweet, innocent girl. Obviously, the real Mickie is somewere inbetween. Mickie was a hardcore legend on the independent circuit, and its a shame she doesn't get the recognition she deserves. She has infact, been labelled one of the best technicians in the world. And is indeed, one of the top 10 Womens Wrestlers in the US, hell, even in the world. Shes had 5 star matches with Simply Lucious, Trinity, etc.  And i'd just like to point out, just because you are 'strong', it doesn't make you a great Wrestler - look at Chyna, look at Batista and so on. Mickie was the first girl to do a clockwork orange match, she has even wrestled Bobby freaking Lashley! Her technical skills have even been compared with Bret Harts. Seriously, she is amazing. I cant even comprehend how talented she is. Mickie really can get a crowd reaction, and her skills are there. Shes an all-round Diva. Shes amazing on the mic, i just wish people would see her stuff from TNA and ROH, and basically everywere else.|`|Cuh0xFSraa	HHH, Shawn Michaels and Edge are the Best!|`|6u2YkXjlaa	Mickie James|`|QMveJrziaa	LUFISTO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|mDuiiVN7aa	1.Mickie  2.Natalya  3.Beth|`|nzKo4TFvaa	Jillian Hall|`|l3AZzVfMaa	Natalya  Mickie  Beth    ...but I wouldve had Melina as my number one.|`|E7TkNO00aa	Beth  Victoria  Mickie James|`|gVCZlEPIaa	You forgot AWESOME KONG!!!|`|LhT5WqMgaa	beth phoenix|`|enTcg0o0aa	Beth Phoenix is the the better one. besides sexyness n being hat!!!! she is also strong carrying a 260 pound man . so she is the best|`|Ad8m1dYXaa	Personally, I would say Mickie James... Have you seen her "Alexis Laree" video's? She's hardcore, sexy and athletic... Mickie is young and will be one of the all-time greats when she retires... This girl has the "it" factor, and to top it all off, she's the most popular young woman in the WWE right now... She has all the signs of a legend in the making... But seriously, her wrestling skills are sick! Like I said, if you haven't seen her Alexis Laree days, I strongly suggest you watch them! You will LOVE them!|`|ZqrIDrAraa	Beth Natalya, and Mickie. Natalya really needs a oush. She's so much better than the Bella's and McCool.   You did forget the best women's wrestler though: Awesome Kong.
OfNTLq3Qaa	I agree Batista isn't the greatest but he's far from the worst to ever step into a WWE Ring.    Cena is held back by a gimmick that doesn't allow him to perform at a level he's more than capable of performing at. In OVW he was great, Cena actually has a lot of talent we just don't get to see.|`|YwgGcERMaa	I think Batista is a decent wrestler and  his power moves look cool because of his size. Cena has  the look and very good mic skills to make up for his limited move set. I am sure there are 100 worst wrestlers that have wrestled in the WWE in the past. But hey thats just my opinion.|`|QMveJrziaa	Batista...yes, he is awful    Cena...no not even close.He does have great mic skills and charisma. He was just pushed way to fast, and forced down our throats for way to long. I am not a Cena fan, not even close...but he is not as bad as people make him out to be.|`|nzKo4TFvaa	no they are best in WWE|`|6jSxYrZnaa	I think Batista is the butch, and Cena is the femme.|`|sqfjfR3iaa	No, there have been much worse wrestlers than those 2 in the 45-year history of the WWWF/WWF/WWE. If you ever had the chance to sit down with Jerry briscoe and Pat Paterson they could tell you about 4 decades worth of bad wrestlers. Giant Gonzales and Bastien Booger are two that come to mind.|`|p7BjjPtNaa	No, I agree with you. And the worst part is that they are main event and overrated. Oh and they are steroid abusers.|`|l3AZzVfMaa	No, I wouldnt say that they are the worst but they are certainly not the best. I do think they are a bit overrated because of Cena's gimmick and Batista's body.|`|pT0SjzZGaa	are They great? Nope i've seen alot better, but are they the worst? nope i've seen waaaay worse. what about The Great Khali Truly the worst wrestler I have ever seen, Abe "Knuckleball" Schwarz, Bad News Brown all of them take the cake for being worse than cena & batista|`|XNbKc7Rzaa	Technically, yeah they're not great but as entertainers, they are great.

gnj5Wublaa	Is your friend a liverpool fan? if so, its just sour grapes, mate. In the first match, Benitez moaned about us playing for a draw. What happens this time? they go down to 10 men, then replace riera with mascherano, then attempt to shut up shop & play for penalties. What a hypocrite he is. We certainly deserved our victory on the night.|`|nJ5kceMBaa	A win is a win, although I wouldn't say Everton were the better team - even with Liverpool down to ten. Both teams were equally as painfully pathetic I'd say.|`|OYYYNCyCaa	only Liverpool supporters would think this    what is your friend a scouser or something|`|IlDD3qumaa	Your friend is wrong Everton deserved to win against a team playing 10 men behind the ball.|`|vF5lU8zeaa	.|`|B7LyNQtBaa	Nahhhh.They won it fair and square.  Liverpool dominated the first ave but everton dominated the 2nd half and extra time.|`|4BppP7Mkaa	He's incorrect.|`|uUitKmJMaa	Nah, They tried theyre hardest.    We were all over the place.|`|96e3aa0cb1e4c4ec1e3d9d8ecff90f48aa	what ever anyone say's if you support a team you stick with them through good and bad times , so you hold your ground my friend , we have a team with no strikers available and we were the better team on the night as we wanted to win more so when Gerrard went off injured jags just stopped torres from playing his game so his job was done but he done more than that and thats why he got man of the match|`|1ZyPSCikaa	cristiano ronaldo|`|IOKilPsFaa	everton deserved to win..  to be honest they should have won the game back in anfield..  liverpool wasn't playing their best|`|qD3QirUJaa	Your friend is a sore loser and a joke.

First you start running like long jump, then when you reach the first board ( usually about 20ft away from the sandpit) you jump and then you get to put touch the ground three times before you reach the long jump board, then you land just like long jump.

He signed a big contract to be a franchise player, but he is not a franchise player. He is a good player who thinks he is great, which is the worst kind of  player to have on  your team (See Terrell Owens). I'm a Wizards fan, and I am very disappointed in Arenas.|`|AA11488609	Arenas is the bigger disappointment.

I71WIC0paa	First on the list would be the SD Chargers. Although they have a very dedicated fan base, ownership has been looking for a new stadium deal for a while now, I remember reading that they've spent around $10 million in doing so. Personally I think this would be a bad move for the franchise but this is one of the most likely teams to move.    Second would be Jacksonville. The team has some serious attendance problems and has been for sale for months. The owner, however, has said if the team is sold there would be a clause in the contract that wouldn't allow the team to be relocated for a certain amount of time, so while the odds are low it's a distinct possibility in the somewhat distant future.    Third on my list the Bills. Buffalo is a small market and new york already has the Giants and Jets, who completely dominate the market and the media there. It seems to me that a move is likely in the future, but I think the NFL and the Bills are trying to do something with Canada. The Bills have permission to play one game per season in Toronto until 2012. I guess the NFL is trying to expand the NFL's influence, something like what they're doing with the London game each year. So they probably will move, but I think Toronto is more likely than L.A. if it does happen, but you never know.    The Minnesota Vikings are another possibility. They introduced plans for a new stadium to the city which would mostly be paid for with tax payers money. Their current stadium lease runs out in a few years so if they don't get their new stadium a move could be possible. Apparently the owner has strong ties to L.A. so that makes a move there more possible.    Other teams that are a possibility, but less likely are the...  1.Oakland Raiders    2.San Francisco 49's      Side Note- The NFL has expressed interest in these two teams sharing a stadium together in the bay area. I don't know the exact details though. SF also plays in one of the leagues wost stadiums and can leave if they want to under their stadium lease.    3.Saint Louis Rams- The Owner is looking to sell the franchise, and a buyer might be looking to move it despite a good stadium deal and good fan base.    4.New Orleans Saints- I don's see this happening after Hurricane Katrina, that would be a public relations nightmare, but you never know.|`|wYdHeAE9aa	Chargers are on the move, the NFL has 3 months to stop the process. Chargers can be in LA the soonest!    Another story eludes to the possibility that even the Vikes could make a possible move.     1. Chargers  2. Vikings  3. Rams|`|eIOlBzm8aa	Chargers hired a LA based publicist to get fans in LA but they are trying for a stadium in Chula Vista. Raiders and Niners are probably going to share a stadium. Jaguars should move to Orlando or LA. Probably LA the fan support in J'ville is pathetic. The Rams could move also.|`|QtjnmEzoaa	The Jaguars. Jacksonville offers very little support for an NFL franchise. I don't the change being imminent though.|`|u7GBP579aa	the rams because they use to be the los angeles rams|`|cdQryr7paa	There was talk about the Raiders and the 49ers sharing the same stadium like the Jets and Giants do.  Not sure if it will ever come about.|`|4kdlE54Paa	The 49ers and the Raiders were proposed by the NFL to consider sharing a new stadiun in Santa Clara (far from LA).  The new stadiun in LA is not going to be built in Walnut.  It is being built in the City of Industry.    The Rams, Chargers, Raiders, and 49ers are all candidates.  The Santa Clara stadium has not been approved (last I checked).  There was also rumors that the Jags may move because they haven't been grasped in Florida because of the Dolphins and Bucs.    Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|YCGsmftpaa	The Vikings or the Lions. Detroit is a dump and its market value is decreasing at a sharp rate since most of the jobs there are lost. Los Angeles is the nations third largest market if im not mistaken and are desperate for another team next to the Trojans haha.    The Vikings want a new stadium and will be playing in the Univ. of Minnesota;s new complex even though it holds 10,000 less seats. If they can find a suitor in LA i would not doubt it if they left.    Watch out for the raiders pulling a sleeper and reloacating. If Davis sells the team as some rumors have mentioned.|`|AA11066475	Theyre actually talking about SD moving up to play in the new stadium set for Walnut CA.

NNHzm4J2aa	That would be one of the greatest ideas to be brought to the table. this will prove to the media and to all the fans who are one sided that the WWE is for every single person. your PPV though would increase new interest and spark up viewers and buy rates from the different countries the wrestlers represent.     This reminds me of the olympics which is something great and something to honor and respect the different cultures and races around the world. this would even let the lower card individuals get on the main card and prove their true abilities.    ?FAITH?|`|nzKo4TFvaa	MIDDLEAST WOULD DESTROY AMERICAN WRESTLERS|`|NXktxy8jaa	That would actually be a great Pay-Per-View. I think that many people would watch it and support the wrestler that represents their country and culture. I would honestly cheer for Batista in this case, even though Jericho is my favorite, Batista represents my country of Greece.     Another thing is that if WWE did make this Pay-Per-View, then maybe that "WWE Is Racist" rumor would stop going around. This PPV Event could show the world that WWE is for every culture and background, and that they are not racist in any way.     Great Thought!|`|42uw2Xauaa	a widespread of rascism would be attracted so i would not think it should happen for the sake of WWE's existence|`|mDuiiVN7aa	Why is Cena italian?|`|fvMv1DT3aa	It would be really cool actually and not racist at all like some of the answers stated. It could really define american wrestling given that America is made up of so many different cultures.|`|9CLRMnhSaa	Dude you would be the best for creating PPV's!!!!|`|O8iiloGYaa	Not to be rude but that's races.     That would not be a cool PPV.    A cool PPV is all the matches in the WWE being used.
KkZE2NDYaa	Trout are wonderful in a smoker. I like them better than salmon. I use a Brinkmann type water smoker. You know, the ones shaped like a verticle cylinder. The meat gets hot enough to kill any possible parasites,but the water pan makes it cook with a moist heat. Fish cooked in a smoker doesn't take nearly as long as other meats, usually about 2 hours depending on the thickness of the fillets or steaks. If you want to cook a 4 to 8 pounder whole, it will take longer. I use olive oil, course salt and fresh pepper as a rub. For whole fish try some dill or rosemary in the body cavity. Use a milder wood for smoke, apple is good, but alder is my favorite if I can get it.|`|8SyUHkPXaa	*blush* Sir, you know I can't cook!|`|uzNm9KtYaa	Lake trout or Mackinaw as they are often called in the north can be cross-cut into steaks or slabbed out boneless and then prepared using ANY of the common recipes recommended for salmon.  Look in any cookbook to find a variety of options for these "good to eat" fish.  The sizes you have are perfect for eating and I wish I could join you at the feast.  Enjoy!|`|Vakup5Jvaa	Smoked or on the grill are tasty.      some recipes  http://www.smokingmeatforums.com/forums/...    http://www.freshwater-fishing-canada.com...    http://www.stormychinook.com/recipes.htm...    http://www.mackdays.com/lake_trout_recip...|`|DHIudHy2aa	If you are going to smoke them, make absolutely sure they are parasite free. If they are not than just cook them up.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	You can smoke 'em, but they're tough to keep lit.  All kidding aside, yes you can smoke them.   Marinade them in a brine overnight (they sell some really great mixes), and then smoke them over a mild wood.  Apple or hickory works good.  Some of the other wood has too strong of flavor like mesquite and cherry.|`|fVcYkX2Faa	yes on the grill|`|8279d0a907ccc5fff04ebdb6ed176b32aa	i find the fish that are high in oil content are good smoked or canned or even deep fried|`|zI37m4Fzaa	Oh yes, smoke them!   I use to smoke my own fish. Now when I have a few nice size Lake trout, Steelhead or Salmon. I take them to a local smoke house that does a very good job and reasonable.

I will have to hand the mic skills award to Santino|`|42uw2Xauaa	batista sucks|`|Nzqt4Qu7aa	I'm going to have to disagree with you on that one buddy. I forgot he was even on the show for a while, haha.   :D|`|9f74caaf5c144aedc435309558b06d0eaa	Batista is one of the most formidable wrestlers. However, he knows about three basic moves: powerbomb, spear, spinebuster. He's more of a bodybuilder than a wrestler. Batista's matches were always so predictable. He was better as a heel, especially when he was with Evolution.|`|RyLOBfL2aa	Dude, Raw is boring with Batista, all he does is whine about how he can't get a WHC.|`|AA11230418	Raw still has a lot of talent|`|QMveJrziaa	Are we watching the same Batista?

Sorry, your statement caught me off guard.  I'm glad you like Batista.|`|iK4pMtmzaa	I'm the exact opposite. I think it's better without him. Also I think he has the WORST Mic skills in the company. I truly can't stand him, I wish he was on ECW because I usually don't watch ECW.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Totally disagree|`|SOuezSW2aa	RAW IS SO MUCH BETTER WITHOUT BATISTA!

The show is definitely not boring, especially with all of these new storylines going on.|`|RlZvWkSIaa	Raw is better without him, I mean, Batista was really cool back in 2005 when he won his first WWE title, but after that, he faded away and he wasn't as good as he once was. Same scenario with Cena, was good from 2005-06, but he got old, bring back Christian Cage and Raw will be better.|`|5xIroQjMaa	Mic skills? Since when has Batista shown any hint of having mic skills? The only wrestler you could compare Batista to is Goldberg.|`|UzEAVZ6Aaa	And the question about Batista's steroid use is where again?|`|CzTXKJoNaa	Two points. This question is worthless.|`|AA12360334	OMG ur crzy raw is better without batista|`|8nNFsTiLaa	i think raws better without boretista|`|IE79ZqyNaa	LMAO I CANT BELIEVE YOU SAID THAT!!!  Batista is one of the worst wrestlers, what am i saying THE MAN CANT EVEN WRESTLE. I hope WWE fires him becuase of his bitching...  All Batista does a ***** becuase he hates his spot in the WWE, you know why?!?! RAW is better off without that Stupid Animal....|`|0tJl0L5Raa	Being filipino myself, I try to give all my support to batista (half filipino). It's rare to see other filipinos in sports.

l4WEwTWwaa	I'll put Lopez at number one. I think he deserves that spot because he he beat a lot of notable people and although his division only had a handful of notables, he took them all on and thensome trying to find some competition. He also unified all the belts in his division to become undisputed champion, Marciano didn't do this, and I'll explain in a second why I rank Calzaghe where I do. So you have a guy that has the most recorded wins for a fighter that retired undefeated and fought everyone possible and still unified all the belts. Next I'll rank Marciano. Although the heavyweight division wasn't what it used to be by the time he hit it and you could make the argument that Marciano ducked Joe Louis until he was old, he still showed off a great amount of skill. He had a cast iron chin, monstrous punching power, and a tremendous will to win. He could box slickly and quickly or brawl and slug it out with his opponent. He fought both kind of fighters and adapted to their styles easily to beat them all. Had he hit the division just a little bit earlier or later and faced just a little more competition, I would rank him number 1. Last we have Calzaghe. I'm ranking him last because his quality of competiton is poor and very atrocious in general. He fought nothing but euro bums from his country and refused to travel to America until everyone was near 40. The only fight in his entire career worth mentioning is the Kessler fight and if Kessler hadn't fought like he was scared of him, he would have stood a very good chance at winning. Calzaghe isn't even an undisputed champion like people call him because he vacated his IBF title before the Kessler fight. So Calzaghe's competition is poor, he was nearly beat by the old Americans he fought, and he just seemed to duck too many people for me to take him serious.|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	lopez marciano calzaghe and here is why calzaghe didnt fight are fighters marciano fights were who was great for the time lopez the same put he had better fighters during his time then marciano had|`|6QhACK70aa	all great fighters    mayweather is great as well    whoever stays undefeated is great to me personally|`|dh48AkbCaa	ricardo lopez  rocky marciano  joe calzaghe|`|2k8TEiRtaa	Marciano, Calzaghe, Lopez. I think that Joe Calzaghe is one of the top fighters in the world today. not to say that Lopez does not deserve his props , but Marciano not being here. That leaves Calzaghe. He should recieve his props too.|`|kqP7GwOcaa	Marciano was an all time great, as was Ricardo Lopez.  Calzaghe was a reasonably good fighter who beat everyone they put in front of him, but they didn't really put very many real threats in front of him.  His victory over a 43 year old Bernard Hopkins was his best fight, but somehow, I just can't bring myself to consider Calzaghe's career "great" in from a historical perspective greatness is defined as much by the caliber of opposition at risk a fighter takes.  Calzaghe simply didn't take any real risks in his career, so his unbeaten record isn't the same as say Marciano taking on guys like Walcott, Charles or Moore.   Ricardo Lopez fought just about everyone in his weight class, much like DeLa Hoya, Ricardo didn't duck anyone.  The difference was Ricardo won where DeLa Hoya lost.  That said I respect DeLa Hoya more for losing to the best of his era than Calzaghe for ducking the best of his, records aside, the level of competition is what made DeLa Hoya a better fighter than Joe Calzaghe even though Joe never lost.  Had Tyson retired undefeated prior to the Douglas fight, Mike Tyson would have still been a mediocre fighter in my opinion, simply because he beat mediocre opposition.  The same can be said to a lesser extent for Calzaghe.  Beating has been's and never was's doesn't make a fighter great.    1. Marciano  2. Lopez  3. Calzaghe|`|l88wIu2Eaa	cajun chicken    chopped parsnip    and diced peppers|`|OURb1rnTaa	1) lopez  2) marciano  3) calzaghe      why these particular 3?|`|a4c7XSWHaa	Rocky Marciano  Calzaghe  Lopez

I didn't include Liverpool/ Man United as I don't count that as a true "derby", but it is arguably second to the Glasgow match in terms of passion, excitement and the sheer dislike their fans have for each other.|`|96e3aa0cb1e4c4ec1e3d9d8ecff90f48aa	oh dear Number 3 is wrong     Liverpool v Everton is a derby     Manutd v Man city is a derby     Man utd v Liverpool is not a derby|`|wurimjbnaa	1. Tottenham V Arsenal or vice versa - My friend said that these teams are complete rivals and during the game between Arsenal and Wigan the Arsenal fans chanted "stand up if you hate Tottenham..."    2. Liverpool v  Everton or vice versa - It's just a battle of the merseyside area.    3. Sunderland v Blackburn or vice versa - Not as amazing as the others but these always come out with dramatic results.    4. Celtic v Rangers or vice versa - According to my teacher this once used to be like a war, now it's not as bad.    5. Man United v Man City or vice versa - I support Man Utd and I know the kind of reaction the fans get, its not destructive but it's very lively.|`|mtlYMbs8aa	Celtic v Rangers  Liverpool v Everton  Man Utd v Man City  Arsenal v Tottenham  Millwall v West Ham|`|Hiasgb75aa	Man Utd v Liverpool  Arsenal v Spurs  Newcastle v Sunderland  Liverpool v Everton  Rangers v Celtic|`|py25T599aa	Arsenal&Spurs  Barnsley& Sheffield Wed
73nTYgdraa	For 800M it's cool. Just sprint a lot and keep your strength.|`|xGLyp2TOaa	Actually you need the endurance of a miler and the speed of a 400m runner.  This is still a race that is primarly anaerobic so stamina is only going to do so much for you.    I would run however it feels natural, if your trying to make yourself take longer steps your probably over striding and putting in more effort for less return

Gutierez is really good at rolling around on the floor  Duff is great at having a huge go at a refereeing decision...even when he has just dived  Taylor - Is a hollywood standard actor|`|632BbbUtaa	ronaldo. rooney evey now and then|`|htQX8Ywgaa	Oooh - well i expected Robinho to, but no, he doesn't. He over reacted when someone caught him in the face, that's the only thing I can remember.  Elano has dived too much, Jo has (or he may just be amazingly weak). I like Zabeleta but I remember him going down when he could have easily stayed up a couple of weeks ago. Didi Hamman's a master of winning free kicks in his own half - diving? I'm not sure, they are soft fouls but still fouls. Erm, can't think of any other than that.  So it looks like our divers are all South American...    Got to give Dunnie a mention though, this guy is solid! His leg was bleeding and he didn't go down, his face was bleeding and he just crouched over. I hear United fans saying how tough Vidic is, but http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKEcPBikp... - 1:00.|`|nJ5kceMBaa	Steven Gerrard, Albert Riera.|`|LReOvHEdaa	kate..wat about Gerrard and  Babel?  I agree Eboue goes down easily..n dats about it..I  dont think vela dived.  Edit:Aww come on ..even Jayde agrees..|`|fEWhwumZaa	Riera goes down a bit easy.   And lets face it Stevie isn't exactly a saint now is he..|`|uXXbegw5aa	I'll admit to Gerrard|`|FG9fIQL3aa	Adebayor!    Vela dives?|`|Maja0Gzdaa	Herita Ilunga...    p.s.I only said that because everyone else has said someone...I odn't think he dives really...|`|H7AcXAyaaa	What for?|`|zu0W6hCTaa	cristiano ronaldo no question!|`|IlDD3qumaa	Ronaldo thats about it.|`|Hiasgb75aa	I admit Zokora has dived once or twice, but other than that we are a fair team|`|4BppP7Mkaa	Ashley not Eboue:(:(:(|`|C6d5yElWaa	Wayne Rooney is probably most guilty... Yes even more so than Ronaldo... Ronaldo goes down easily from challenges but rarely dives anymore.    And Eboue isn't just a diver... he rolls around in "agony" for a good minute or two!    Liverpool fans need not apply - everyone knows about Steven's famous star shaped dives ..|`|HxET88bDaa	I've said it before and don't really need a question to say who they are...for us it is obviously Ronaldo although he hasn't really dived as off late. Also Rooney has done it in the past. I am willing to admit these players aren't saints..

fKfd4Tp1aa	Edge was brilliant on Raw since his feud with Cena was immense, he cut fantastic and hilarious promos while he was in that feud. But ever since he came back after his Hell in a cell match with The Undertaker, he has been booked terribly on Smackdown, he really should move back to Raw.|`|nzKo4TFvaa	No edge hate RAW|`|S0u3HKzhaa	It is a possibility but I don't think they need Edge to interfere,when DiBease and Rhodes are with Orton.If anyone from Smackdown should show up on Raw in future weeks I think they could surprise us and mix things up in this storyline by having Triple H come over.After Orton almost kicking Stephanie last week.Just a thought though.|`|mDuiiVN7aa	I would say all 12 participants of both Sd and Raw will fight in the ring before the night is over, monday night on Raw.

OaniQuqpaa	Clemens. he could be looking at some jail time for lying under oath, Bonds never really lied under oath. when bonds was asked if he did roids he just gave some stupid answer like what you talking bout or i dont no man just leave me alone. clemens actually said that he never took them or gave them to anybody|`|8sqOVMvNaa	CLEMENS LIAR,CHEATER, AND TRAITOR    |`|tvuhGTD9aa	Bonds is actually under indictment and heading to trial.    No charges have yet been filed against Clemens.    Clemens may very well be wallowing in a stickier mess, but Bonds is under a bigger thumb today.|`|obPSaYf3aa	Roger Clemens would be the person in hotter water.  He displayed not much humility when he appeared on Capitol Hill, and the McNamee situation is getting more out into the open.    Barry Bonds told a grand jury (probably in CA)  that he "unknowingly" used steroidal substances that he thought were only 100% flaxseed oil and a muscle "balm".  Playing dumb to save your career is a smart move and even if his career is done for, it's in the past about steroid usage and now he has to answer to the court about possible perjury.|`|swG8dVBRaa	Barry Bonds because he is now know as the "home run king" and thats more of an image than roger clemens and absolutely no one like roger clemens anymore so he is sorta already down and it cant get much worse for him|`|fHxpycJSaa	It's equal They've both committed perjury while under oath, and neither will now to into the Hall Of Fame. It's Karma at it's finest. I love it when the arrogant people get things shoved up their rear ends.|`|R0sfdiNeaa	definitely Clemens|`|5xIroQjMaa	Clemens, because he was a media darling. Bonds was always hated, so he had less to lose. Clemens was fawned over by broadcasters and sportswriters everywhere, so when he went down, they turned on him like sharks.|`|8j70Neqeaa	there both lying bas andboth going down in disgrace.|`|12JCF1Wkaa	I want to say Bonds but most likely Clemens is. I think their both losers and liars a disgrace to baseball and their fans.

FQ2- I don't wanna think about it  FQ3- YES!|`|D7Dubtt9aa	I was cringing when i watched it i knew we were going to lose when gerrard went off and torres could not out run the everton defense. The players looked like they did not want to be on the pitch. Reminds me of spurs under ramos.     We should do ok still gerrard is not our team and we did beat man utd with out him    Lucas is young and making mistakes rafa should drop him i have no doubt he will be a decent player in years to come he should go out on loan to get experiance not in a team as big as liverpool|`|MjPd9vyYaa	I was dissapointed with their performance. Gerrard was a big loss for us and some of the players just don't know how to play behind Torres. The minute Gerrard came off Torres wasn't playing well. As for the defence they were actually very good thanks to Skrtel. Mid-field wasn't that great but they still got through. Lucas, Lucas, Lucas....he is an awesome player for his age. Players make mistakes...and this one unfortuately was his second of the game. The red card he did deserve it...referee knew what he was doing. Benayoun to me was the man of the match second to Kuyt. They didn't play well...Everton did deserve the win but they were lucky as well.|`|aGXankr2aa	For the first 75 minutes, we Liverpool were the better team.    No Gerrard, what was the score against Man U, when we had no Gerrard and no Torres - I  hate to admit it, but Real aren't as good as Man U.    No, he's not.  Jimmy Carter is by far the worst player to put on a Liverpool shirt.|`|IXDiEX8eaa	Honestly Everton deserved that goal as it was not a fluke.Liverpool also played well but just lack of confidence shown by the whole team.  As what Rafa said,they can still win the Prem or the Cahmpions League or even both.Don't jump to immediate conclusions that just because Liverpool was kicked out,they are starting their lousy acts.|`|Pfq2zRejaa	we wer shite FQ2 it maybe a draw FQ3 yes lucas quite possibly the worst player ive ever seen let alone in a liverpool shirt|`|iBqKp6cEaa	1) what's to think they played incredibly rubbish.... don't won't see the horrible thoughts in my mind  they even controlled the game (mabye 10 mins but still) got a few chances didn't get them everton were bound to score as they got a shot off the post  end of :(       2) it'll be harder .... deffo....  the captains gone yeah ok, but we need to remain patient mabye a miracle will happen ??    3) rafa has so much faith in the young crap "braziliian "  at least he'll be banned for a few games   :( ....  :l ......  ;)|`|8Nov6Xaoaa	It was not good. Everton deserved to win. If Liverpool think they can  play like that 2 try n win an FA cup tie then they can think again.  P.S. Also I don't think that there is anyway that they will win the premier league.|`|xLyNsywiaa	Gerrard should be back for Madrid...

Liverpool are below average without Gerrard.    6 of Torres' 7 goals this season have come against teams playing with 10 men.    Better hope Xabi Alonso keeps play(act)ing.

That being said, if he left MLS, the league would be completely embarrassed by Beckham leaving, he and the league would lose TONS of sponsorships. For Beckham personally, he should go to Milan, but for soccer, it would be better if he stayed in MLS.|`|svjGH6hgaa	He should stay at Milan for the good of his career.  But I think he will end up going back to LA.|`|op4fEbEVaa	He should stay with Milan.|`|BdR6eQWOaa	He should go back to LA but I'm not sure that will actually happen.|`|9NX7rx8Yaa	AC would be far better for his career, he has his money, and his fame, now all he wants is some trophies (international ones maybe!)|`|PwjtzTjyaa	If he wants to play for England at the World Cup he should stay at Milan but if he just wants to have a kick about and pick up a huge wage he should go back to the Galaxy.|`|N0sbhRu6aa	AC MILAN.     A million reasons why Ill tell you 10 of the top of my head:    1) Italy is one of the number one footballing countries and the passion is greater there. It is a much better ambient being around a full stadium.  2) No one gives two shits about football in USA.  3) There is basically no competiton in USA  4) Beckham is with one of the greatest players in the world:  a) Kaka  b) Ronaldinho  c) Pato  d) Maldini  e) Cafu  ...and much much much better. The entire team is excellent.   5) There is way more money in Italy. Euros are worth more.  6) They don't treat him good in USA.  7) The league is better with better teams  8) It helps him train up for the world cup. USA don't train you for ****.   9) Italy is a nicer place to be than USA.   10) Beckham would simply be happier over there and over here.    Think about it, would a painter want to make his career in a country like France or Malaysia? Same principle applies.|`|o7gV56ngaa	Well according to the Daily Express (English newspaper) he has a clause in his contract that he can leave L.A. for free in November. So if that's true maybe L.A. should sell him to Milan and at least get some money for him.|`|yITDn2iiaa	I think he must go, he hasn't won anything in the L.A. Galaxy and he has an opportunity to play at the highest level again with one of the biggest teams in the world.|`|a5Xtd3EVaa	I would like to see him stay just for the sake of the sport in America...but if i were him i would probably stay with Milan|`|AA11573840	He hasn't done anything for LA Galaxy besides selling T-shirts. Go|`|ipznrSQyaa	I think that he should stay with Milan because they have more interest in him.They put him to play instead of Ronaldinho. If he goes to Galaxy, he will not do his best performance. He is just in Galaxy because of money

1jmXT4Vvaa	I'd recommend the 40 s&w if you go with an auto, and 357 if you decide to get a revolver.  The 40 holds more shells than a similar 45, but not as many as the 9mm.  The 40 hits harder than a 9, but not as hard as a 45.  Kind of the best of both worlds.  As for the 357, you can shoot 38's in it for a low recoil, cheap practice load.  If loaded with the 357's, it'll have the most power of any of the calibers you list.  The 10 mm is a great cartridge, but not real common.  It can be expensive to shoot, and shells can be hard to find, plus, some people complain about too much recoil.  The real question is revolver or auto?

RlZvWkSIaa	Ice Hockey was thought to be invented in the mid 1850s by British soldiers staying in Nova Scotia, Canada. They used a rubber ball initially to play the first ice hockey game with some basic rules.|`|cvIcBH7Waa	it started when a kid was ice skating he picked up a stick that fell on the ice from a tree,he was skating around with the stick when he saw a rock he skated up to it and hit it.

A few days later he had a bunch of kids skating around and hitting rocks with sticks|`|6e2c3f79b5d1c7c11ce3cfa9d37906e4aa	it was probably Wayne Gretzky's  great great great grandpa or uncle!|`|FcettwI8aa	yeah it rocks. i got a high school game friday night. lol|`|6gpiy5wQaa	That is just a guess at the inspiration behind hockey. The actual origin of ice hockey is unknown. Another popular guess is that ice hockey evolved from the game of field hockey that has been played in Northern Europe for centuries.  Today's rules were devised by Canadian J. Creighton. The first game of ice hockey with Creighton's rules was played in Montreal, Canada(1875).|`|FzyMni8caa	The first recorded games of ice hockey were played by British soldiers stationed in Kingston, Ontario,and in Halifax, Nova Scotia , in the 1850,s. Before that field  hockey-type games were played in Ireland ( Hurley), Britain and even Mongolia.  It is now played in most northern hemisphere countries, and is the official national winter sport of Canada.   In any case it,s a great game, unless you,re a Maple leafs fan, in which case ,not so much!|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	Hockey wasn't really invented, it sort of evolved.  Ice Hockey was not invented, nor did it start on a certain day of a particular year. It originated around 1800, in Windsor, where the boys of Canada's first college, King's College School, established in 1788, adapted the exciting field game of Hurley to the ice of their favorite skating ponds and originated a new winter game, Ice Hurley. Over a period of decades, Ice Hurley gradually developed into Ice Hockey.     A man who is still North America's most quoted author, Thomas Chandler Haliburton, born in Windsor in 1796, told of King's boys playing "hurley on the ice" when he was a young student at the school around 1800. This is the earliest reference in English literature of a stick-ball game being played on ice in Canada. Haliburton, who wrote the first history of Nova Scotia, was the first Canadian to acquire international acclaim as a writer, and the account of his recollection is therefore of great significance.|`|fdtB4XHtaa	it started as a gamecalled shinny wich turned into hockey and bandy|`|SYDaRM11aa	I think canadians did

Everyone has an opinion so don't say other wrestlers suck. There all good, but i have to agree batista seriously can't wrestle but he has a good reaction frome the fans because he's a face . In general they're all good but i prefer John Cena    Edit: I'm not the one who was giving thumbs down btw|`|XMXuJSPWaa	For entertainment value - Randy Orton  For wrestling ability - hmmm......Randy Orton  For Mic skills - yep, Randy Orton    A clean sweep.    (We've all been thumbed down! Cena? Is that you?)|`|42uw2Xauaa	Randy "Killer" Orton|`|qhTxeSnbaa	First off, Orton is out of the picture.    Second, Cena has the best fan reaction.    Lastly, Batista is the strongest superstar.    So you decide: Cena or 'Tista
bRoC9HCjaa	I think that United might be a little shacky in the back, but I beloeve that Johnny Evans will step up and be a fine replacement. As for our atack, I would say we put in around 2 goals,and hopefully Rooney is healthy. Go United!|`|Xbgd5h8zaa	the defense will be very shaky especially with Ibrahimovich there go inter jose crush them|`|BdR6eQWOaa	I don't think so but I hope it will.

If you can, you hit righty against lefty ect ect ect|`|AA10103147	One. At bats mean too much for a manager to allow a hitter to go to the plate with no chance of hitting the ball. If he can't hit it from the other side he won't be standing in that box.
UYbNRxcqaa	be a cheerleader.  when you all wear your uniforms to school,  you get to wear a short skirt ;]  but yeah, be a cheerleader.  i am, and i would have it no other way.|`|ZTwGmiwwaa	i think you should do cheerleading. i do all star cheerleading and cheerleading is sooo much fun. you will make friendships that will last a life time. and you already did all star which is much much harder so i think it would be perfect for you and you would probably excel in it. and yess volleyball is very competitive and i think you would have more fun as a cheerleader. also since you did all star cheerleading i think you would fit in better if you did cheerleading with your team. i dont know if you would have a better status though.  hope this helps (:|`|lZLr2MGMaa	Well I actually had the same conflict. I was in cheerleading AND in volleyball. (Cheerleading season is over now so its just volleyball.) But I can honestly say that cheerleading was ALOT better than volleyball. In volleyball you cant always be so sure your gonna play and in cheerleading you will. It really depends on what you like doing most. I think you should stick to cheerleading, if you want to be in it that bad. :D hope i helped!!|`|OtyWorbRaa	In my opinion I would choose volleyball I played for 3 years and I LOVE IT!!!!!! cheerleading doesnt seem to be a very competitive sport if you are competitive then I would choose volleyball it ROCKS!!!!!!!!
2ynZARB4aa	you'll be popular if you have a good sense of humor, are confident and are friendly. not just because of the sport you play.|`|GBSnBbWiaa	If you are a cheerleader you will have MEGA popularity but if you are a volley ball player you are a volley ball player!

wurimjbnaa	They are, football is just a joke now in Man City's eyes. Paying 250k per week on Robinho just to kick a ball? That's outragous, it makes me feel sick when anyone can kick a ball.|`|lhASsVwcaa	Man City are a joke, Kaka 108m that is over the top. There just buying there way through the EPL, good job most footballers have sense over instincts|`|5c0ea2e937929dc820b4f96293aa83a2aa	Didnt Chelsea do that 4 years ago|`|InCpu9Vfaa	i say they're enhancing it    giving us all good laughs at how bad they are even tho they have a     stuffed wallet|`|C6d5yElWaa	I personally love it, just love it.|`|PsCS0GK3aa	No.|`|o7gV56ngaa	It's called capitalism. Would you rather it be like the socialist sports system that they have in America?|`|2OO9U8o9aa	They are just the latest in a long line of clubs doing just that . All these foreign owners are using the clubs as playthings and even worse all the money from SKy and SETANTA is being thrown away on ludicrous wages for all these greedy players . More of this money should be used to bring on home grown players at the academies|`|xlyk63xRaa	what chelsea can do it but not man city ? looks like a united fan might be alittle threatened ...|`|ipznrSQyaa	Yes they see football as nothing and only negociation. If they use the money more wisely and also play with their hearts, they would be top 5 in the Premier League|`|QuGTZJIVaa	Give ot a REST will you! This song has been sung so many times it's getting boring.  Football lost it's soul YEARS before the Arabs came on the scene.    We got investors in to bolster our spending (as we were broke and hadn't spent more than 10 million over 3 years) and these guys happened to have more cash than other investors, and now you're whinging!?  Have a go at Arsenal, Liverpool, Aston Villa, Portsmouth, West Ham, Chelsea and United before us okay.  Or else you'll sound like a jealous hypocrite.    The naivety of some people......|`|hWaynBpMaa	God dont you people give up. when it was the top two Man Utd and Arsenal everyone moaned about United. then jack walkers millions made Blackburn champions but no one said a word. Just slagged off united again. Newcastle tried the same undeer Keegan but Fergie psyched him out. people still moaned about united. then we had a long period of wengers bargain buys against fergies super kids. and still they moaned about united. then we gained a top three and liverpool developed into a fourth place team and chelsea spending 500 million broke Arsenal and Uniteds hold andsd still they moaned about united and grumbled about a little about chelsea. Villa have now joined the top of the table fight making it a top five. which does not please any of the top four. Man united are safe but Arsenal, Liverpool and even Chelsea now without Romans Millions are worried. another club to challenge the top fours supremecy scares all there so caalled fans. if i supported united i wwould love to see city fdighting for the championship. do you notice in the EPL we get stars like ronaldo and torres when they are developing but we cannot get the Messi`s or Ronaldinho`s of this world in their prime. they dont want to come until they are at the end of their carrers now city acn offer the money and once hughes gets the team consistent they will be top six then they will be pushing for top four and attracting the messi`s and Villa`s of this world. and can anyone say it would not be great to see the best players at your ground. when you look at what teams get into debt to stay in the premier. and look at Liverpool a 350  million pound debt to be paid by July all leavered against the club. a huge wage bill. arsenal billionaire share holders but they spend very little. huge debt on the club from the new ground. Chelsea  Roman is now protecting whats left of his fortune. Man Utd are the worlds richest club and their debt is coming down every year. now man city are the richest but any players purchased are not put off onto the club. the owners have put aside a billion for the clubs developement. Hughes has shown with the santa cruz traansfer that he is in control of the transfers. KaKa and Robinho were statements of intent. so lets just enjoy that we may see the best players in europe in the EPL within 3 years.|`|fLpnC8qtaa	The true spirit of football was lost as soon as money began to be more important than the game itself and the fans. Though there is still a lot of room for it to decline further.|`|svjGH6hgaa	All future world-class players approached by Man City should follow Kaka's footsteps.|`|ymdelC6Yaa	They can't be any worse than Chelsea a few years ago.  They seemed to buy players with no intention of using them, just so other teams couldn't sign them.
ZzXxRLWcaa	I absolutely consider him protected and more interested in the "0" on his record then being a true champion.    For one, he only left Wales twice. That's unacceptable and it means most of those 47 victories are against Welsh cab drivers, soup cans and scrubs.    Secondly, the two "young" fighters he fought were the way overhyped Lacy and Kessler.     Thirdly, B-hop or Jones woulda whooped him in their primes, but he waited until they were old and mostly feeble.    Fourthly, he NEVER knocked anyone out.. no one of note anyway.    Good fighter, probably a HOFer... but overrated.    EDIT: Kungfuex...  Thats an excuse. So its ok for someone to nab a belt, bring it back to their home state, never leave and reject all challengers?  BS... thats a coward, not a champ.    Not to say Joe's not a champ, but he is overrated and he DID duck quality opponents. B-Hop wanted him for years|`|xlyk63xRaa	since when does the champion have to challenge ? people nameall these american fighters that he didnt fight, and its quite boring now to be honest, people need more common sense , champions dont challenge , challengers challenge, joe has been a chamion for 11 years now, 10 years he ruled super middleweight , you can name some good american fighters he never fought but who's fault is that ? joes ? why would it be his fault, you cant say he ducked anyone because the likes of jones and hopkins and pavlik, they wouldnt go near super middleweight whilst joe was king.    edit at daze... you obviously are an american, i noticed in your previous answer you gave all these names, ALL american names, ask yourself a question, why didnt these ' great names' go to super middleweight ?   and joe did challenge roy jones when jones was at his peak, jones refused    edit again - if a boxer wins a belt he can take it where ever he wants, thats the luxury of being a champion, you call the shots not the challenger, you have a belt and are a champion , and you dont need to leave your home because you won that title, people have to come and win it off you then they take it back to where they want to go....you are gettin absoloutly no where with your argument , no honestly you really aint getting any where, you dont understand the meaning of a champion and the luxuries you get when achieveing this, why the hell would joe want to or need to go to america ? because you say they are good or big names ? no no no no no they have to go to wales if they want to be champion , to be the best you beat the best, and none of these american names went to wales, and when they did they got schooled, when joe decided to step into the states he destroyed your legend who just beat pavlik, so dont even call him a bum , roy jones was challenged at his peak so you have no argument in that.|`|98f9000f3689e28983bfec6d7a62524baa	Oh come on!  A very unfair comment!  A guy who has got 46 -0 professional undefeated fights under his belt (excuse the pun) including WBO, WBA, WBC and IBF super-middleweight belts.    He beat Hopkins and Ray Jones jr, who both thought they would beat him, on their own turf, these are known to be the best!    Go out on a high I say and at his age, good decision!    I thought ducking and diving was on par with boxing......avoid the punch...who the feck wants to be punched in the face?????????    As for wanting to fight Americans...........they did not invite him until last year............and then it was only for the purse, which Americans boxers are all about!|`|2k8TEiRtaa	He beat Bernard Hopkins. Who then beat Miguel Cotto. Anybody who beats Bhop is a great fighter in my book. He didn't fight the best of the best. But he made a good career out of his boxing. that's more than can be said about many.|`|OURb1rnTaa	an undefeated yet protected fighter. hopkins will be remembered more fondly with his 5 losses than calzaghe will. there's just something about joe that does not feel right.|`|Msel5eAvaa	He won championships over old Americans via slapping. No dominating performance whatsoever. One of the most overrated boxer.    Kungfu, Calzaghe never destroyed Hopkins, Hopkins even knocked down Calzaghe. He just slapped his way to win.|`|Qnp6Wiszaa	Joe record stands as a fact. Im guessing lots of the negative stuff comes from Americans who sem to feel they dominate the world in boxing amongst other things! He went to the US and won, fact. Live with it instead of throwing weak arguments in a sport dominated by politics. Joes record stands as UNDEFEATED!|`|l4WEwTWwaa	Everyone but British people will remember him as even more of a duck artist and joke than Mayweather. He fought euro bums his whole career and comes to America to fight two 40 yr olds and all of a sudden he is the best boxer ever? Don't give me that crap. Had he fought more Americans in his career he would be no where near undefeated. The only fight in his entire career worth mentioning is the Kessler fight and Kessler could have won had he not fought like he was scared of him the whole fight. Calzaghe has shown that he will not travel far from his comfort zone unless it is for a 40 yr old and that is unacceptable for someone that wants to be taken seriously. To be recognized as a great champion you must fight all the best Competition out there without worrying about your record. Your record and titles mean absolutely nothing. What matters is who you got them off of. That's why I have ZERO respect for Floyd Mayweather and Joe Calzaghe. I will show more respect for Sven Ottke before them.|`|6rxhges4aa	i remember him as the guy who wouldn't fight carl froch.    you don't become great by ducking fighters-and that tells me that with the exception of b-hopkins (and had he been ten years younger he would have slaughtered calzaghe) a lot of his opponents were hand-picked.    benn/eubanks/minter/stracey/mcguigan would NEVER have turned down froch in their respective categories had he offered them out as he did calzaghe for one reason.    because they were true greats!.
KMASS2Gmaa	I have a love/hate relationship with this kind of question. I love to throw in my two cents in and hate to tell a man or woman what they will want in a Knife. The only thing as personal and private as choosing your knife is choosing your mate.  If you are a real woodsman maybe not even your mate. When it comes to women I am a Rubens fan. Most men today are Angie J. fans but to me she is way to skinny and wears way to may men's brands.    When it comes to a survival knife the two you show are trash. If you want a survival knife then you want two or three knives for different jobs. You want one for skinning and gutting small game, one for carving wooden tools and a saw for cutting larger trees for shelter and dead wood for fires. As for a survival kit that is another matter entire.  Forget Rambo and his massive boat anchor.     When I go into the woods I carry a Soligen hunting knife I have had since I was 21, I also carry a Leatherman Wave and a Sodbuster pocket knife.|`|OAEuYZkZaa	Way to go Coasty!  Real women have curves don't they?    As for the knives in question, I'd not take them as gifts, or at least I'd pass them on to some of the kids at church.  They are cheap junk.    When it comes to knives, you want a knife with a solid tang, not a damned hollow handle.    IMO not only are knives with holes in the blade and "saw teeth" on the spine stupid they are pretty damned useless.    You'd be a damned sight better off with a traditional Boy Scout sheath knife and a belt pouch with a wire saw, and some fishing gear and fire starters.  And any damned fool that goes into the "wilderness" without a good compass in his pocket deserves to get lost.    For that matter, a Buck model 110 Folding Hunter will do pretty much anything you need a knife to do.  Just be sure to have a whet stone in your pocket to freshen the edge if you have to skin a large critter.    Another word of advise for you kiddo.  You get what you pay for.  An $8.00 knife is not much of a knife.  It has been lots of years since I've seen a knife worth having that sold for less than $50.00.    Doc|`|7XXTxFUmaa	2|`|M6fzLJtmaa	Both seem kinda cheap, $12 get a K-bar if you want a  Rambo type of knife.|`|kY3uuTq9aa	the first is ok the second is **** and the third is your best bet|`|TvARYVRJaa	a skb,, and a kit of your on its life and death your talking  here,, so shop around for quailty ok thanks|`|TPZwmQK9aa	Be sure about them both having the same items in the survival kit.  The second one doesn't have photos of everything the first one does.|`|AA12243350	neither one. Sorry, these are inexpensive low quality knives. First off, a compass will not work correctly near the metal of the blade, and those compasses are also very cheap. The saw back blade sounds good, but in reality, if you stick the blade into something, it hangs up on the saw teeth making withdrawel difficult, Next, those saw teeth are to wide, and they fill the area between the teeth very quickly, and then stop working, and as you work, it leaves the sharp edge up, which is an accident waiting to happen. Forget the saw feature, use the blade to cut thru items, even using a billet of wood to drive the blade thru tough wood, and cut it in chips like a hatchet or axe would. Next, the blades are of a brittle metal, and will snap if used to pry or even if trying to free it from wood etc. forget the hidden compartment. Putting stuff in there changes the balance of the knife, putting matches or a lighter in there creates a hand grenade out of the handle in the event it is set off from heat/impact. I could go on, but  to save time, just remember this bit of advice from John Ruskin " there is hardly anything in the world that some men cannot make a little worse and sell a little cheaper. The people who consider price only are this mans lawful prey"  In other words, you get what you pay for.   Forget "rambo" and hollywood, buy a quality knife from from a quality company. Yes, you will pay  a good price for one, but what price do you put on your life?? Next, forget one of those Crocodile dundee knives, you want one with a 5-7" blade and the thickest back edge you can get (for strength) and a full tang with a grip that fits YOUR hand, not some super hero wanna be. Don't scrimp on the sheath either. Cheap sheaths will allow the knife to fall free as they loosen up over time or break all together when you need it the most. Save a little more and get quality that will last your lifetime.  I speak from experience!!  shoot safe|`|TRPnPVa5aa	Neither, they're crap.    If you want a good quality knife at a low cost go with a KJ Eriksson Mora. For $10-$20 they're the best deal going in bush knives. Go on knifeforums.com or bladeforums.com and you wont find a single bad word regarding Moras. Those Swedes make a damn good blade at a low cost. Also the Scandinavian style grind is very easy for beginners to sharpen and maintain.     These are bush craft knives made for cutting tasks not batoning through logs. Most either have rat tail or 3/4 tangs so they wont take much batoning. I've never seen this as a problem as I'm of the school of thought that one blade can't do it all and always have either a hatchet or heavy machete with me in the woods     I prefer the wooden handle 01 Carbon steel models but they also come in laminated carbon steel blades and stainless steel with plastic handles.       Ragweed forge(linked below) is a great place to buy/get info on Moras and other Scandinavian knives (I'm also addicted to puukkos).|`|a3f78ba390310d91be76895fb8126262aa	Survival in the woods really doesn't depend on a knife as much as the skill and experience of the person. Any SHARP knife will do the trick. But you have to know how to use it. On my first hunting trip, around age 16, I carried an army knife with an 8-inch blade. The first deer I saw killed and skinned was skinned with a 3-inch blade folding pocket knife. The last elk I cleaned and mostly skinned was done with a 3-inch blade small sheath knife. I have carried that knife (the 3-inch blade small sheath) for years and have cleaned birds, small animals and large animals with it. I have built fires using a small pocked knife to shave wood, I have build camp furniture using a pocket knife. As you might guess, I'm a fan of a small knife. Must be sharp and I do carry a stone.  You can make snares, build traps and skin game with a sharp rock if you have to. Remember, it really depends on the person, not the knife. Read some books on survival and practice in your backyard.

5EuOTAjJaa	No. Simple physics. The pull of gravity at Earth's surface plus wind (air) resistance would cause the ball to hit the ground before it traveled 60+ feet.|`|fgqghe4yaa	No becuase of the effects of Gravity.|`|5xIroQjMaa	I'm sure they could, but it would be a wild pitch, so why would they try?|`|BZMPax7Naa	Nothing can be thrown in a straight horizontal line. A bullet from a gun can't even travel in a straight horizontal line.  As soon as the ball leaves the hand gravity will act on it.|`|OaniQuqpaa	yes, if you get a pitcher like Tim Lincicum, he is a pitcher for the giants and throws it around 100mph, the backwards rotation and the baseball can give it a perfectly horizontal line because the spin is not great enough to make the ball rise, but it is great enough to give a perfectly straight horizontal trajectory|`|V25THlPKaa	No.   It's that gravity thing.|`|HeWUbyHJaa	Yes. Any submarine pitcher on a clear flat ground. They release the ball as it touches the ground and it rolls in a straight line. Gravity cannot affect a ball that is already on the ground. Other than that, the second a pitcher throws it, no matter how fast, is affected by gravity.|`|CshFQShGaa	Gravity will prevent it from traveling on a perfectly horizontal plane. With the exception of a very low sidearm to submarine release, most pitches travel downward anyway, so gravity is slowing the ball down and pulling it towards the ground.     If you were to set up a rifle on a tripod and level the barrel, then fire it, while simultaneously dropping a bullet from the same height, the two bullets would hit the ground at the same time. They'd be quite far apart, of course, but they'd hit the ground at the same time.
bglr4m0Naa	Stay with the team that you are guranteed to get into. You don't want to miss the game simply because you were afraid of letting your friends down.
Y4mz8BShaa	Crosman airsoft BB's are low quality and will tear up your hop-up bucking, nub, and barrel.    Airsoft Elite Blacks are the highest quality .20's you can get. There is a quality difference between AE Blacks and AE whites.|`|HAH7ILrSaa	Crossman is known for many garbage products but when i bought their 5000 ct white .20g bbs, I haven't found any bad seams, bb damage nothing. perfectly round. Those are the only quality bbs from crosman. but ther others, from crosman like the .12 are trash.    sure i would reccomend using other bbs|`|mQbVBi9Waa	yes .20 is always the best.|`|vMZCED9jaa	That's kinda funny, because my friend was doing that with that same gun(it was an echo but pretty much same), and I told him to throw that trash away.  Okay, first of all Crossman is a very low quality brand. Sure, you could get away with shooting springers with friends in the back yard, but nothing else.  Only use KSC .20bbs, and airsoft elite .20s.  Just because they're .20s, doesn't mean they're all high quality, perfect bbs.  I only use Ksc's, but a lot of my friends tell me that airsoft elites' are pretty good.
yHvh7tFlaa	Bob is correct, except he left out one little detail. Potvin LEGALLY checked Nilsson, and Nilsson broke his ankle on the play. Fred Shero, Rangers coach at the time, also said it was a legal check.     You would think after 30 years,they could come up with something different?|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	The tradition began after Potvin checked the Rangers' Ulf Nilsson on February 25, 1979, and broke his ankle.|`|1p1Jj7LDaa	Because they are jealous of his cups... and the team he broadcasts for now haha|`|HsJiUVkYaa	they are really cheering "Potvins Cups" while holding up 4 fingers :)|`|y7jH7dOZaa	cause he played for the islanders and the rangers dont like the islanders but they know he was good
LhkjM9lHaa	- There is no temperature (besides EXTREMES) that will cause a paintball gun to not fire, but you should below about 10 degrees. You could lower, but you risk damaging your gun. Also, NEVER fill a gun in very cold temperatures and then bring the full tank in your house. Gas is heavier at colder temps and more will fill up the bottle when it's cold. Then when you take it to a warmer place, the air will expand and your bottle will burst. Very VERY dangerous.|`|N01TBp5Naa	throw away C02 canisters can shoot at any temp    big C02= not  under 5-10 degrees at all and recommened to not shoot at tempertures below 35 F|`|db1be68f513a16fbf0274a78fad75becaa	While a paintball marker will still technically work under 40o , it will not work well. If you are just out in the back yard shooting at trees and screwing around, that's fine.  But if you are actually competing, you should switch to HPA or N2 if you are planning on playing in below 40o temperatures|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	As the temperature lowers, you need a couple of things.  If you have an expansion chamber, that helps.  If you use a remote line, that helps.  If you can lay off the trigger, that helps.  I live in Montana and we have paintballed down to just above 0 with co2.  Several of us have made the swap to hpa to avoid the hassles.  There is nothing like shooting half a cup of snow out of your barrel every shot.

vRmsvSb6aa	You have got to be out of your mind if you think any team is going to give up more than a 3rd round draft pick for TO. Boldin is by far a better WR. That is a joke. There is noway they could get those players on their team. Wake up. You're in dream land.|`|rNUyV1EYaa	Better question: if you were the Cardinals, would you ditch Boldin for Owens? That is not a smart move; especially since Boldin is much younger than Owens and not nearly the same headache.    As for Haynesworth, he will cost more than the Cowboys can afford. And I doubt Lewis is leaving Baltimore.|`|VghVdPfsaa	TO is a big distraction, but the Cardinals aren't stupid to trade away Boldin for TO in any deal even if Boldin is unhappy. The Cardinals would want something better in return.|`|cdQryr7paa	Damn, that would be awesome.  If only all those things would happened.  But I doubt it.|`|d31e5ca4d3aca06ec2364133c20df1daaa	Trading players for players in the NFL just don't happen. It's not like in the other sports. Also there is talk that Jerry Jones's sons want TO released. Even if he TO is relased. And the Cowboys want Boldin. Boldin isn't a free agent. And to make a trade for Boldin. The Cards are going to want draft picks. And the Cowboys have no 1st or 2nd round picks to trade this year. They may get Ray Lewis. But Haynesworth is going to want BIG time money. Your asking for allot. I mean there is a cap in the NFL. If you want Terrel Suggs than your going to have to go with a 3-4 defense. He isn't good in any other defense. So to answer your question. There is less than 2% chance of all you want to happen.

To train for distance, our coach has us do 15 laps sprint with 5 seconds rest between each and then do a full 500 medium-hard pace. Outside the pool, you would probably want to work your arms or do cardio type stuff.|`|A57LMS5Qaa	what is your time?? im in 9th grade and most people swim it in about 2 minutes.|`|yS5f1XLFaa	a good time 4 the 400 free..... well right now because it is shortcourse season, people are swimming the 500 instead of the 400. but their times are around a 5:25ish. for a 400 i would think maybe 4:25 or 4:10. you can improve ur times by working on ur flipturns, tuck in tight, push off on ur back, have ur hands in a tight streamline. and ur starts. u can practice clapping wen ur coach blows a whistle to practice ur reaction times. good luck!

AsOno1Wdaa	I had this same questions several years ago and found this explanation helpful in explaining what it is and some general treatment options.  Rest, Strengthening exercises and stretching before any activity worked the best for me (see below)  I believe my injury was caused because I bought the wrong shoe to and was not stretching properly before and after my runs    Patellar tendinitis treatment is a long process, no matter what type of treatment you've chosen. Recovery may take a few weeks or months if the injury isn't too severe, or as long as a year or more for people who undergo surgery.     Most people with patellar tendinitis find pain relief and improvement using conservative treatment  meaning treatments other than surgery. If you have persistent signs and symptoms for six months or more, you may want to discuss the potential benefits and risks of patellar tendon surgery with your doctor.     Conservative treatment  The conservative approach to treating patellar tendinitis aims to reduce the strain on your tendon and then gradually build up the tendon's strength. Your doctor may suggest several techniques to accomplish this, including:     1,  Rest. Rest doesn't mean giving up all physical activity, but avoid running and jumping. Your doctor can suggest other ways of staying active without stressing your damaged patellar tendon. It's especially important to avoid any activity that gives you pain.     2.  Adjusting your body mechanics. A physical therapist can help you learn to better distribute the force you exert during physical activity. For instance, an athlete who jumps frequently might learn proper takeoff and landing techniques.     3.  Stretching your muscles. Inflexible muscles, especially inflexible thigh muscles (quadriceps), contribute to the strain on your patellar tendon.     4.  Strengthening your tendon. A physical therapist may recommend specific exercises to strengthen your patellar tendon and the muscles around it. Exercises can also help strengthen your quadriceps. A specific type of exercise for strengthening the quadriceps called eccentric strengthening has been shown in some studies to help treat and prevent patellar tendinitis. This strengthening exercise involves lowering weight slowly after raising it, such as a seated knee extension exercise.     5.  Patellar tendon strap. A strap that applies pressure to your patellar tendon can help to distribute force away from the tendon itself and direct it through the strap instead. This may help relieve pain.     6.  Massage. Massaging the patellar tendon may help encourage tendon healing.   If you've recently developed patellar tendinitis, you can expect at least several weeks or months of conservative therapy before you'll be able to fully resume physical activity, including jumping. If you've re-injured your patellar tendon, the time for healing may be even longer.     Strengthening Exercises I used for my rehab    You can do the hamstring stretch right away. When the pain in your knee has decreased, you can do the quadriceps stretch and start strengthening the thigh muscles using the rest of the exercises.     Standing hamstring stretch: Place the heel of your leg on a stool about 15 inches high. Keep your knee straight. Lean forward, bending at the hips until you feel a mild stretch in the back of your thigh. Make sure you do not roll your shoulders and bend at the waist when doing this or you will stretch your lower back instead. Hold the stretch for 15 to 30 seconds. Repeat 3 times.     Quadriceps stretch: Stand an arm's length away from the wall, facing straight ahead. Brace yourself by keeping the hand on the uninjured side against the wall. With your other hand, grasp the ankle of the injured leg and pull your heel toward your buttocks. Don't arch or twist your back and keep your knees together. Hold this stretch for 15 to 30 seconds. Repeat 3 times.     Side-lying leg lift: Lying on your uninjured side, tighten the front thigh muscles on your injured leg and lift that leg 8 to 10 inches away from the other leg. Keep the leg straight. Do 3 sets of 10  .   Quadriceps isometrics: Sitting on the floor with your injured leg straight and your other leg bent, press the back of your knee into the floor by tightening the muscles on the top of your thigh. Hold this position 10 seconds. Relax. Do 3 sets of 10.     Straight leg raise: Lie on your back with your legs straight out in front of you. Tighten up the top of your thigh muscle on the injured leg and lift that leg about 8 inches off the floor, keeping the thigh muscle tight throughout. Slowly lower your leg back down to the floor. Do 3 sets of 10.     Step-up: Stand with the foot of your injured leg on a support (like a block of wood) 3 to 5 inches high. Keep your other foot flat on the floor. Shift your weight onto the injured leg and straighten the knee as the uninjured leg comes off the floor. Lower your uninjured leg to the floor slowly. Do 3 sets of 10.     Wall squat with|`|76cAAPfBaa	Do not do as some do, and continue to run through the pain, you will damage it worse. You need to ice it to take down the swelling, wrap it with a compression bandage, and limit using it heavily for two weeks, as you were told. Don't stop using it completely, or it'll shorten up, and hurt all the worse when you start running again. So, do some walking while healing, but NO running!     It's also very good to lay down on your back, and place the leg up above your heart level. That will allow blood to run out of it, and take down swelling when it gets painful.|`|ZLt8TwOiaa	I agree with Mike and on www.runnersworld.com there is a section on injuries and how to treat and prevent them.

He's like Flair was in his last years, He looks his age, and there's no way he can put on a match like he used to. His shtick is tired, but he does still draw fans. I guess as long as he can do that, they'll keep him around as long as they did Flair.     Undertaker is a different story. He has in-ring presence, something that you can't teach, and rarely find. There's only a handful of wrestlers who can impact a stadium just by entering it, like Taker can. Not only that, he is by far the best wrestler in the business for putting people over.

Hey Chicago, bring back Keith Magnuson, may he rest in peace.      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Magnu...  Keith Magnuson (April 27 1947 - December 15 2003) was a professional ice hockey defenceman from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) between 1969 and 1979. Magnuson was killed in an auto accident in Vaughan, Ontario with fellow NHL alumnus Rob Ramage behind the wheel (Ramage survived the accident, but was later found guilty of vehicular manslaughter).    Magnuson played 589 career NHL games, all with the Chicago Blackhawks, wearing   3, and scoring 14 goals and 125 assists for 139 points. Although he didn't score many goals, he was a part of a solid defensive team with the Blackhawks. Perhaps his most telling statistic is his 1,442 career penalty minutes, which included a large number of fighting majors.

BQ - It's possible for him to have a 4 star match with Shawn Michaels. Any match that consists of Shawn can be worked greatly. As well all know, he's more of a brawler, but it depends how the story is told during the match.

If she worked on her leg and core muscle strength, as well as quickness, she could be a great player some day.|`|yIdwMPsoaa	she likes to hit:P all i can say!|`|3buQDaRDaa	It is hard to tell because the kids she is playing against suck.|`|URHdnHCpaa	no all she can do is hit thats all
XQoH9ZI5aa	Toronto landing Bouwmeester is VERY unlikely, he is an UFA on July 1st and he has stated that it is his desire to be with a team where he can take part in the play-offs and that is more important than the money......in other words, he wants to go to a winner.....the rebuilding Maple Leafs do not fit that bill.     As for Antropov, seeing as Toronto is rebuilding, players like him are surely to get traded for draft picks/prospects and Columbus might be a player. Pittsburgh might make sense too.     Don't believe the rumours, it is nothing but a bunch of armchair GM's speculation and 999 times out of 1000 they are wrong.     Antropov is best suited as a winger ideally!|`|6e2c3f79b5d1c7c11ce3cfa9d37906e4aa	bouwmeester is on the move for sure, so is antropov.    both are UFA this summer, so these teams want to get something for them.    nik and jay to the Oilers!|`|ks1WIgSKaa	Columbus is looking for a center.

Y31Ci8vlaa	Yes.|`|CBVlu3Gvaa	I have to agree with CG on this one.  My home course is a par 72 with a slope rating of 146.  Old style course with tight fairways and a Ton of trees.  I shoot fairly well on the home course.    When I do play away from home its usually on far easier courses and for some reason I generally don't shoot any better.  Maybe its the lack of any real danger that affects my concentration level or something.....But there it is.  Oh........ On my home course.....I only hit driver on about 3 holes.  In season I generally play to a 4|`|sBrummATaa	not really|`|aX8nee8gaa	The slope and course rating change when you move up on a tougher golf course. So even though your scores go down, the course rating goes down too. Most likely your handicap would not change. In fact the opposite can be true; if you go play a course that is really "easy" with a course rating around 68 in can be very challenging to keep it right around par just to maintain your 3 index. The lower the course rating, the lower your margin for error. I know plenty of guys who are supposedly scratch golfers because they can get it around in 76 or 77 on their "tough" home course, but they shoot the exact same scores or worse in tournaments on different tracks. The home course or local knowledge advantage seems to reduce handicap by at least 2 shots. If anything I think the course ratings are way too generous and make it too easy to have a handicap lower than your ability. Perhaps an adjustment down for home scores would be the fix.|`|hec58R76aa	in short. yes. the easy courses get you some easy birdies, and easy pars. it is easier to recover, there are less  hazards, and the courses are set up for older players. However if you score well on tough courses, the easy ones can play hard because your instincts will be off.
76f8cea41f4939e17e6dabe3557f7e33aa	Because they can get away with cheating, and in my opinion that has to come from the NFL front office.  Look what happened to the Colts after they won the Super Bowl, I believe they were penalized right out of the playoffs.  I Think the NFL believes it has to have an East coast team win to help revenue. The Cards are to small of a market.  How many times in the last 20 hasn't there been an East Coast team in the Super Bowl? 3  The NFL, NCAA and the NBA prove the best cheaters win.|`|AA11066475	seriously? how else was your offensive line going to stop Harrison, woodley, farrior, smith????     Just like in basketball where a person will foul a someone on a break away to make him earn the two points... Cardinals did the same thing.  It's either let the guy go, take the sack, lose 8-10 yards and possibly injure Warner OR hold the guy and have a 50/50 chance of getting caught.  The Cardinals were overwhelmed.    Same crap happened to the Steelers in the 4th quarter. they started panicking and they got 6 penalties.    refs can only see and call so many penalties.    Hate your team for giving the refs reason to call the penalties, not the Steelers because you got penalties.|`|0ylaEVtraa	bull crap they did not cheat you are a sore loser let me guess you are a arizona cardinals fan right?|`|Awfv7TV3aa	"if they got those, they would of won" really? and dont you feel Arizona was responsible for most of those penalties, or were they all Bull.**** calls? there were questionable flags and non-calls but thats not the reason Arizona lost that game. any real Football fan will admit that

Muay Thai is taken from the actual name, while Thai Boxing is basically the westernized name in the sense that it is boxing from Thai.    What's suppose to be different is between Muay Thai/Thai Boxing with Kickboxing.     Kickboxing has much more broad sense than Muay Thai as kickboxing as a sport in America has different rules than Muay Thai, especially in regard of the use of elbow and knees.    Although at this present time, most of serious kickboxing gym will also teach many element of Muay Thai|`|ZUTfMc8vaa	i am not sure|`|PJmpTnlKaa	"muay thai" translated from Thai to English is "thai boxing"  muay = boxing  thai = thai (of course...)

Overall, the majority of the guys can beat the majority of the girls. Some highly trained girls can beat guys that are less well-trained, but again, a better trained man will generally beat an equally trained woman. There's nothing sexist there, guys are just more muscular, generally speaking. It's a sad fact of nature.

Generally speaking, most guys will defeat most women in most one on one sport. Even if you take a guy & a woman & train them the exact same way, the guy will still defeat the woman. This is because men are the physically dominant gender. Take Laila Ali for example. She may be able to beat some male boxers at a lower weigh than her, but I guarantee she'll have trouble beating guys in her weight range. Beth Phoenix and Chyna are fine athletes, but realistically, they won't stand a chance against most of the male wrestlers in a non-scripted wrestling match. I do give credit to women everywhere who've made a name for themselves in any sport, but they're always going to play second fiddle to men.|`|d9tCS7BPaa	I agree with j h 78 and I am not going to lie just because I want to sugar coat it for the girls.

I have both a 12 gauge and .22lr rifle that should do to job very well. 3) Plentiful ammunition. Getting some weird round like a .410 or .380 restricts your ammo supply. Stick with something easy to find like 12 gauge, .22lr, or 9mm.     Overall, if you need to pick only one, your best option would be a 12 gauge loaded with  7 shot or larger.

In my area, suburbs of Orange county, 28 miles south of downtown LA, surrounded by about 13 million people and 5 major criminal gangs, I would choose something reliable, simple, high power, and easily will outgun anyone I meet. I plan on shooting from a fortified position with very heavy cover.   I would use either my SKS (for people with lots of guns or just lots of people) or my MN 91/30, which kicks like a mule, breathes like a dragon and barks like a cannon. great for shooting at night, and great when I need that extra penetration or stopping power. People complain about its bolt, I've practiced with it enough I can quickly chamber another round with it still shouldered. 5 aimed rounds in about 15 seconds.     if for an arsenal of weapons, I need to add the following to my collection:  a Henry or Marlin lever action .22LR  A lever action pistol caliber carbine: In California unless I can afford a ruger pc9, there is no other alternative. I'm gonna get one in .38/357 and another in .44 mag/.45colt.   A bolt action sniper of some kind. Last I looked I found a Howa M1500 scope combo for under 700 bucks. I need something able to shoot up to 500 yards accurately, but not break the bank or need me to buy ammo that's hard to get in extremely large quantities. (so .223 or 3006, .308)  I need someone to mill down my SKS bolt so I can have it accept detachable magazines.  I need a reliable 5+1 12 ga shotgun. with a legally short barrel. I have a 20 ga, but I found ammo is scare in variety (like slug, buckshot, etc).   A couple more mil surps, like Mauser M48 or 98 rifle, Another MN rifle.    Then I'll spend the rest buying more ammo and magazines. Hopefully my wasr10 comes in before the anarchy starts. I ordered it in Nov 2008, still waiting. Otherwise I'll drive thru Santa Ana or south LA and hopefully I will find some guy with an AK47 that I can buy. Its anarchy so I don't think the ATF will bother me. I would wait a week or two after the anarchy starts and by then food is scarce- I can probably get it for 1 or 2 crappy civilian MREs. I have both mil spec and civilian MREs, civilian ones suck and I get them cheap, specifically for trading.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	Good luck.  Around here all those kinds of guns are sold out and so far back ordered they aren't even accepting new back orders.  For me personally, I'd opt for the Mini 14 Target with the laminated stock.  The mini 14 is as reliable as the ak.  The target model will shoot as well as any ar.  And I'm sure I could scrounge up 223 shells no matter what.  That being said, I don't own a 223, or a mini 14 (I sold my mini 30 a few years back, and kicked myself every day since).  I own a Auto ordnance 1927 a1 deluxe, but I would never stake my life on it.  I've owned it since November, it's back at the factory for the second time.  It will not function with the stick mags, the drums are a hoot though.  I just have not had any sort of reliability yet, so I would never stake my life on that gun.  Jams are very difficult to clear with the super heavy springs working against you.  But my experience with my mini 30, and my father's mini 14, you can bet I wouldn't hesitate on either of them.|`|kY3uuTq9aa	.50 cal. man. and a 9 mm.

It's hilarious the stuff some folks can come up with!    Btw, guys, here's a tip....5.56/.223 is so common *because* everyone shoots it right now....not because there's a huge mass of it out there and nobody uses it.  5.56/.223, if the factories stopped cranking it out, would be gone in days.  Your best bet on ammo is in picking something that *nobody* but you shoots and stock enough for you to use and nobody else.    My picks?

ZKikquiOaa	Cheap crossbows are made of plastic, while even entry level compounds are either forged or even machined aluminum.  A $200 crossbow also don't have near the same energy as a $300 compound at a third the poundage.  A 40 lbs compound bow will send arrows with much higher kinetic energy than a 150 lbs crossbow, due to the draw length difference.|`|zeXMAsF7aa	Supply and demand there is allot more people buying compound bows than crossbows.|`|Jm6Vtptuaa	cheap crossbow    If someone enjoyed killing what disorder might they have?    ANSWER: Having no feelings for others, only yourself is what most serial or enjoyment killers have. It is usually called being a sociopaths or psychopath. Not all of them get their kicks from killing but they do enjoy the power of controlling things, animals people or objects, for their own satisfaction.  You do know, don't you, that most serial killers have a history of animal torture (not hunting or killing for food) and fire setting when young combined with a bed wetting problem.    edit: I can assure Yogi that it is not from a tumor. I interviewed many sociopaths who killed and none had any major medical problems.  Source(s):  retired homicide detective

tzrLDbHWaa	Tough call.  Depends on what you mean by showing promise.  Like..... do you mean showing promise in the NFL then screwing up, or showing promise in college but just not panning out in the NFL.    If you're talking just showing promise at anytime, college included.... easy choice is......    Ryan Leaf.  He was supposed to be a stud.  There were actual discussions all around draft time over who's better, Leaf or Manning, and a lot of people actually said Leaf.      Now, someone like Leaf never showed anything in the NFL, if you want someone who actually showed some skill in the NFL then gave everything away...    Lawrence Phillips.  He had a short career, but he was an explosive back.  He had some success in the NFL, but he was a headcase and just couldn't coexist with his coaches.  When Vermeil cut him, he actually said that Phillips was one of the best running backs he ever coached.  He later tried NFL Europe and the CFL, got into more personal trouble, and I think he's serving a 10 year sentence for assault with a deadly weapon.    A few other choices that should recieve some consideration.    Michael Vick.  Was never a great QB like he was supposed to be.  Had a great arm, was probably one of the best playmakers the NFL has ever seen, he could make something out of nothing, but all this was with his running ability.  He never did get the accuracy needed to be a good passer, but even so, he still would have had a great career had he not gotten into legal trouble.  Now in the prime of his career, he's in prison and may never see the field again.      Maurice Clarett.  Was a great RB in college in his freshman season, and showed a lot of promise, then threw it all away.  Had he just shut up and played and entered the NFL draft when he was able to, he might have amounted to something.  Rather he gave up his eligibility to challenge the draft rules, lost, had to sit out a year, showed nothing when he finally was able to enter the draft, and now is in prison.    Ricky Williams.  I only wonder what could have been.  Williams was among the best in the league before his pot suspensions.  Had he stayed clean and off the ganja, he would still have his starting job (Miami would have had no reason to draft Ronnie Brown) and would probably still be one of the best in the league.|`|C2CCbTRKaa	BACK IN THE DAY,BLAIR THOMAS MR.

Charles Rogers (2nd pick by the Lions in 2003) - Was supposed to be a great WR for the Lions.  Never panned out.  2. Joey Harrington (3rd pick by Lions in 2002) - APparently he was gonna be their savior and lead them into the playoffs.  What the heck happened?  He sucked for a year or two, then was benched and has been put as a backup for the Dolphins, probably to never start again.   1. Akili Smith (3rd pick by the Bengals in 1999) - Who??  That's right.  Picked ahead of Edgerrin James, Torry Holt, Champ Bailey etc., this quarterback didn't even stay in the league for more than a year or two.  Wonder what he's doing now.    Honorable mention:  David Carr (LOL)    You could put Vince Young up there, but I wouldn't yet because he might have time to spark his career back.  These other guys have no chance.|`|a4f17786434be41d57b2e22017646256aa	Vince young is the biggest let down in history and i saw it coming.|`|04VeyeiIaa	god dawm whats wrong with yall. bo jackson fastest back ever best player ever best athlete|`|72b1b35e81e7d39e237e18972e90ad30aa	1..bo jackson was awesome until his hip injury    2..billy sims....|`|a243bdff28f8938b1553bc0befe479d8aa	Won't say Mike Vick, led his team to a couple of division titles and an NFC Championship. Won't say Barry Sanders, the guy is a Hall of Famer, so I will say the Kordell Stewart aka Slash. Slash was the starting QB for the Steelers, who could have started at QB, WR, CB, or Safety if he wanted to. Problem was is that he really didn't have an amazing team surrounding him and had a gun slingers mentality and that led him to throw easy picks and eventually have Bill Cowher cut him.|`|4kdlE54Paa	Michael Vick  Pacman Jones  Travis Henry  Chris Henry  Cedric Benson (kinda)    This would be a recent list.

GKJV2EBSaa	Step1 Wait for your opponent to attempt a sit out.     Step2 As the wrestler sits out, instead of following close behind on your knees, sit behind the wrestler, putting your legs around your opponent's body so that your legs come under and inside of your oppponent's legs. This will prevent the wrestler rolling to the side and completing the sit out.     Step3 Secure a two on one by reaching under your opponent's arms, and grabbing one of them at the wrist and forearm, so that both of your arms are controlling one of your opponent's arms.     Step4 Use your two on one to pull your opponent back and over one of your shoulders, elevating your opponent's legs with yours. Score back points and bring your opponent back to a neutral position.     Step5 Continue the crab ride and scoring back points until your opponent can break your grip and return to base, or use your two on one to and legs to roll your opponent's back into base if you want to leave the crab ride to work other moves.

Sru8JnBBaa	I dug into this awhile back, and found a "firearms statistics" study that was repeatedly cited by the Brady Bunch. It consisted of a think tank comprised largely of Berkeley intellectuals, professors and such, also Stanford, plus a speckling of other ultra-liberals from the lib belt in Northern California. It was clearly a stacked deck, and I'm sorry but I can't recall their name.    I'm sure if you did some digging, you would find their information.    What I read was clearly biased.    The Brady bunch mainly bases their standards on a group of shots fired, on camera, in the early eighties, at a President and his staff. They saw "media blitz" and "dollar signs" written all over it. Any a**hole knows that states that allow private citizens gun-carry rights is full of criminals that would rather walk on broken glass, barefoot, than try to mug somebody who might shoot them.    Here's the bigger problem: The NRA has estimated that around 80 million households in the United States own a firearm. If every one of these households would just join the NRA, LaPierre and the NRA could crush the Bradys in one felled swoop! The problem is, most people in this country are sadly uninformed, don't want to get involved, and many of them are just ignorant, stupid yahoos who talk freedom and rights but don't do anything about it, other than embarrassing responsible gun owners.    Spread the word. What we need is a grassroots campaign that is run with the efficiency of "savedarfur.org" or "the Pickens Plan." These guys are effective, and getting it done.|`|dfBwVxXFaa	whatever they want, its their game and they make up the rules they want!|`|oYf3jSq6aa	To answer your question without the hyperbole  Here is their scoring system  Scroll down to the map and click on your state    The standards that they use are outlined and basically the higher the restrictions on gun control the higher your states grade  http://www.stategunlaws.org/|`|wdR8pPH3aa	Basically it's like golf, you want your state to have a low score.

OK (and a few other states) still let private parties rent table space at gun shows. You can buy trade or sell without doing the Federal Paperwork... it's a private treaty sale. That is the Brady "loophole" about gunshows.    Funny thing is I can take an ad in a newspaper and sell the gun without Federal paperwork either. Media spin at it's finest... we get the bottom of a list complied by folks with an agenda... the way I see things Oklahoma has the 'best' gun laws.

AA11488609	Typically it's between 27-33 for most players on average.  By then a player has the best combination of athletic ability and smarts.  Past 33, the player has to use his IQ more as his athletic ability declines, but that doesn't mean that he can't be a good player anymore.  Look at Shaq, Kidd, David Robinson, Grant Hill and MJ as examples of post prime players who were or are still effective and can play well.  Their stats have dropped, but they still are great complements to a team.|`|JD3yWKNGaa	I think its late 20's early 30's.|`|tuoUkfF8aa	It depends on the player. Usually mid to late 20's though.

zcrJzVauaa	Good try everyone, but heres the real deal. Number one right now, cut shad or herring, you may find at your local fish market, these fish are running now, so it mimics the natural selection. Cheap red hotdogs, cut in 1" chunks, try and hook them good, and be careful casting, kinda tender. Live bream if its legal in your area, absolutely lethal, but illegal in some places. Chicken livers will work, soak them in salt over night before you go, this will toughen them up a little and help when you cast. Live eels, some baitshops carry them. Minnows fished on bottom. Shrimp....but why waste shrimp, earthworms fished on bottom, or your hand if your up to noodlin'......dont suggest it if you live in the dirty south, tends to be a few more reptiles on our end!!!! Save the liver and cheese for the hordourves table, listen to me and youll be eating some mighty fine catfish.|`|VENJHtyTaa	Pretty much anything, remember they are a scavenger fish. That being said I always start with earth worms. If that is not working I will go with cheese or chicken liver. After that some of that smelly bait stuff (don't recall the name and don't want to go out to the shed) ;-)  Have fun and great fishing!|`|LknYI7FFaa	shrimp,or chicken breast soaked in anis over night|`|lECmz3SEaa	Depends on the region where you fish. However, they do bite more during mid-late spring, late summer - mid fall.|`|oSK4IJUSaa	it depends wether your fishing saltwater or freshwater  but i use shrimp in the salt and i would use nightcrawlers in fresh.|`|Limt9t5Qaa	Stinky cheese  chicken livers  your hand|`|q8dX0MsNaa	river fishing?  deep holes. chunks of shad, herring, sucker, carp.  big chunks. give 'em a mouthful. big circle hook.|`|5b5b8e8087fb0045161251b9ffd1a88baa	I use sardines they seem to work good.|`|jf0UV1Bjaa	I love to fish, its just about my favorite thing to do, and for the last 5 years ive taken a very fond liking to early spring catfishing.  Its magical and if youre in a good river it seems like the numbers are amazing.  Personally it seems like the earlier you go, and the colder the water is, they bite on the small garden worms around my house.  Red wigglers i call them.  Never had any luck with big cats biting store bought night crawlers.  I usually put about 3 or 4 worms on a hook, not hooking them all the way down the body so there is a big clump of wiggling worms.  As the water gets warmer i use cut bait found naturally where i fish.   Bluegill and crappie seems to work the best.  Ive bought menhaden and bunker, and even LY or mudshad and they dont seem to work as well.  If you can net some small bluegill like an inch and a half or 2 inches use them whole, alive or dead and they work fine too. And remember too that in the winter those cats are hungry and will come close to the shore to grab bait, but they will most likely be found laying in deep holes.  Go out there and claim those cats.|`|aDNdND6oaa	That's my favorite time to catch them on nightcrawlers.  Just like other fish, they don't eat as much when the water temp drops.  I've caught 8-10 lb channel cats on bluegill rigs throught the ice, if that tells you something.    The nightcrawler is always a favorite early in the year.

HDbMh2YBaa	All of them wouldve been better off playing some college ball. They'd come to the NBA and already know some of the stuff they had to learn on the go in the NBA. I think two years of college ball would be great. I think these players should show that they have what it takes to win at a college level before teams take a chance on them at the NBA level.     Examples are like Carmelo Anthony. He had what it taked in high school and college to lead a team. It was only right for him to come in the league and lead Denver. Exceptions are when you play on a team with too many draft prospects like Florida or Kansas. You want a guy thats the leader of his team and plays the most important role in their success. Dwayne Wade is also another example. When you play on a team loaded with NBA talent its hard to determine if you can be a leader.|`|Nuj1eScCaa	Kwame brown definitely would have benefited from college ball.

ZzXxRLWcaa	They have two leagues like we do, one with DH and one without. (Central League does not, pacific league does)    The overall style of the game is more akin to what we consider "NL" baseball though. Lots of hit & runs, bunts, advancing runners, small ball, emphasis on defense, pitchers using more breaking/offspeed pitches...    Some teams though that have more western players (like Tuffy Rhodes) will play some big ball AL style play (station to station, emphasis on RBI's), so it does depend on the team somewhat.    Babe Ruth introduced the game to Japan oh so many years ago, so its natural that they emulate the older, american style of play (I use the word "oh" to commeorate Satahara Oh, Japan's great all time slugger).   Their athletes arent as spoiled as ours though and are known to be much more team orientated and willing to sacrifice their statistics for the sake of winning.|`|jKOB7n35aa	Both. They too have a league of DHs which is more of an AL style, and a league of no DHs that plays like the NL. Their format is very similar to ours.|`|6826faa24e7136054b7f73bfa7839087aa	The Central League in Japan does not use a DH, while the Pacific League does. From my understanding both leagues over there play more of an NL style game, with plenty of sacrificing, moving runners, aggressive baserunning. However the ballparks are smaller, so the pitchers throw more offspeed pitches over there.|`|GUrgVam5aa	NL|`|lBhkWpDoaa	that's a good question    time for me to do some research|`|OJHO52UJaa	they play NL style, but they have two leagues, one with dh and another without. but they both play NL style. most of their hitters are contact hitters, and when matsui (godzilla) hits 35 a year and is their vision of Bonds, thats says alot

HDbMh2YBaa	I'd get rid of them both. But the most likely scenario is Amare is the odd man out. He's not producing like he should be and its not the coaches fault. He's not the same player as he was a few years ago and thats what injuries do to you.     The Suns are already on the verge of rebuilding. There arent too many teams that would want Stoudemire with his injury history. So the best bet would be to trade him in the last year of his contract to a garbage team for a young guy and some picks. This way the team wouldnt be taking that much of a risk since his salary would most likely come off the books knowing  he'll try free agency.     So look for Amare to be traded this offseason or next season. I doubt they'd do it right now but I could be wrong. His trade value isnt high enough right now though. Lets say he was though, here are the best fits for him imo.    Miami- He wouldnt have anyone to take touches from him and Dwayne Wade is good at the pick and roll. Shawn Marion for Amare Stoudemire straight up.    Atlanta- Al Horford really isnt a guy to demand touches either so he'd be the man downlow here. Knowing that Joe Johnson may be gone soon they might want to push for a title right now. Amare and some picks for the young and talented Josh Smith might work.     Chicago- They're in desperate need for a big man. Stat would fit in well with Rose I think. Dont know who'd they have to give up though. Most likely Deng or Gordon and a couple other guys.    Charlotte- Maybe playing alongside Okafor would hide some of Stat's defensive shortcomings. I dont know who would be in this deal. Felton and Gerald Wallace maybe but he's hurt.    I dont see much happening in the meantime though.|`|d754b3be3baefac8167410c09de8770faa	First of all, I used to LOVE the Suns! I loved their run 'n' fun, seven seconds or less, offense that would always get the crowd on his feet and wanting more! I knew the Suns were going to go downhill when they fired Mike D'Antoni all because of a dispute he had with the current GM, Steve Kerr. Steve Kerr wanted to put his fingers in the pot that D'Antoni already cooked up and he couldn't take it that the Suns liked to run! The way I know, Steve Kerr wanted to coach that team and use the same kind of system that was used when he was playing with Michael Jordan. The Suns don't have the right GM to know how to operate! Remember, this is a guy who played on the same team with Michael Jordan in the 90's, but was only used as a DECOY!   Without MJ, that piece of **** wouldn't even BE a winner! You can't run an offense through Shaq anymore. He's too old and doesn't have the same explosiveness that a team like the Suns need.    What they really need to do is to bring D'Antoni back, fire Terry Porter, and FIRE THE GM for letting one of the best coaches they ever had walk out! Terry Porter is someone who likes to slow the game down with his offense. That may have worked in Milwaukee where he was a head coach, but on a team like the Milwaukee Bucks with no real identity, it's real easy to run an offense the way Porter runs it! D'Antoni speeds the game and puts games into the 100's and forces you to run with him and if you don't have the horses, you're simply gonna fall behind!     If they end up trading Amare and Shaq, but keep Nash, Nash is going to be unhappy, exhausted, and spent. I can see it in his face when he talks and the comments he posts before and after games. I knew he didn't like when the Suns got rid of Shawn Marion. Then they dumped Raja Bell and Boris Diaw, two important cogs of the D'Antoni system. Kerr is trying to get rid of almost everyone under D'Antoni's system just to prove that HE can get some winners on his team, but there's a problem. D'Antoni took that same system to NY, and even though the Knicks aren't winning games like the Suns were winning with D'Antoni, they're still fun to watch because they're piling up the points like never before and running like crazy!     The Suns are flatlining. One (or two) more shakeup(s) and it's LOTTERY TIME for the Suns.|`|98wFqBwSaa	Is that what you call Amare in Phoenix.  I thought his nickname was Armageddon.  Anyway, Davey Stern loves to see black coaches get fired, so I'm assuming TP is out.  But at the same time, there's a lot of teams that will pay Armageddon a lot of money to play for their team.|`|ED7bwcdnaa	Terry get fired, Amare stays.      No matter which coach they hire, they need to play defense to win titles.|`|1W5b0n07aa	the coach always goes before the player.  STAT is very talented but has ego issues and wants to be the centerpiece of the team.  not gonna happen|`|XnhJZQvfaa	No coach is going to get Amare to play hard on defense or rebound like a true power forward.

There is no excuse for a 100 year old Shaq being the best inside defender on that starting unit.

crADtzrOaa	A .50 caliber armor piercing incendiary round from a SASR or Browning M2 .50 may do the trick but you would have to be at a great distance and perfectly perpendicular to pierce 1" of hardened steel.  That's a long shot though.  I would go with a 40mm HEDP grenade they can pierce 2" of hardened steel at 18-400 meters but once again you have to be perpendicular.  Something like a 25mm bushmaster cannon firing a 25mm armor piercing incendiary would probably make quick work of 1" armor, and you probably wouldn't have to be perpendicular to the target.

To that Liverpool fan above with a Lucas pic, what have you got to say about Moriestes, Robbie Keane(28?),  etc etc and all the crap players you've bought in the past 10 years ?    Only Reyes(2x vs Chelski) & Jeffers became flops and I never liked any of them. Hleb didnt shine only till the 07-08 season, so you can never say Arshavin will be a flop. See how quickly Nasri adopted into Arsenal's style. ha ha ha all those hating jealous tossers can fcuk off, Arshavin is ours.|`|4BppP7Mkaa	It's pure jealousy:)  Arsene Knows.|`|uUitKmJMaa	I hate people Hating on Gerrard or torres.

XnhJZQvfaa	If you really want to improve your Vertical jump, first you need to figure out what type of Jumper you are, a power jumper or a leaper, as using optimal biomechanics is just as important as having explosive muscle power. Next you need to figure out what type of power or strength you are lacking. The three basic types of strength are: Base strength, transitional power, and explosiveness or "Reactive" power, they are all different and must be trained in different ways. Now I know a lot of you are wondering what's the difference between the three. Well in short Base Strength is how much weight you can move, Transitional Power is how fast you can move said weight and explosiveness is the maximum speed and distance you can move said weight with each single movement. A good Vertical Jump training routine will include the following exercises:    Base Strength   1: Traditional Squats and Pistol Squats   2: Deadlifts/base building olympic lifts   3: Lunges   4: Core Work (Functional Performance Core Strength= The ability to make your pelvis and spine "lock" and work as a single stable unit, not simply having a 6 pack or being able to do 100 crunches)   5: Stretching    Transitional Power:   1: Box Squats/Tempo Squats   2: Power Cleans   3: Push Press   4: Core Work   5: Stretching    Explosiveness:   1: Ballistic and jump squats   2: Traditional and Compound/Hybrid Plyometrics   3: Sprinting   4: Core Work   5: Stretching    You'll also want to figure out which individual muscles/muscle groups are working inefficiently. You can figure this out by completing a full vertical jump test progression and a baseline fitness test to diagnose any muscle imbalances that you may have. Remember no matter what type of training program you do you must make sure that opposing muscles are strengthened and balanced (e.g. Quads and hamstrings, abs and lower back) so don't skip the quad extensions and hamstring curls. If opposing muscles are not strengthened they will lead to weak links, energy leaks and imbalances will result in poor poor or slow improvement and raise the risk of injury significantly. Do a routine that combines plyomertic/bodyweight, free weight and or acceleration routines. Make sure you are consuming lots of protein to aid in muscle repair after tough workouts You'll also want to replenish your bodies ATP and glycogen stores as they are the fuel for those type IIa and type IIb muscle fibers you will be (AKA FG and FOG) shredding during your workout. In order to gain inches you'll need to tax your central nervous system and force your body to create new motor pathways. If you train correctly you should gain at least an inch a week. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PxcPllTy...    You are only 12 so you need to substitute weights for light resistance bands.    Jump 20 inches higher in 10 weeks:  http://www.program51.com|`|exRVyTzYaa	do lots of squats lunges and ab work|`|HDbMh2YBaa	There are plenty but I suggest you invest in a stepper. If they're too expensive then get a used one online. The stepper I used is the main reason why I could jump so high in middle school. I wasnt tall either so people we're always amazed at my jumping ability.    Try to get a stepper and step everyday until you get tired. Not only does this build calf strength which is important for dunking ability but it improves stamina at the same time. Next do wall squats. Wear some gym shorts and put your back and butt up against the wall. Bend down slowly like you're doing a squat and then explode to the starting position. Repeat until you cant push yourself up. If it feels awkward pretend you're using a weight.     Also if you want to dunk and you're right handed try to isolate your left leg because thats the leg you need to be the strongest. If your left handed then vice versa. Make sure you jump rope and also do calf lifts. The key to exercising is to push your body to the highest extent possible.     If you dont do that then you're waisting your time. You have to train your muscles to get stronger. They cant get stronger if you dont make them. Do all reps until you cant do them anymore. Dont even set a number of reps but rather sets.     Lets say you want to do 2 sets of calf lifts. You do one set until you cant do it anymore and then take a rest and do the other. Dont set a specific number to do because you wont get a full workout.|`|UIi7B3UDaa	crunches, calf raises, box jumping. just to name a few

He is getting old and he cant stay healthy. He hurts the team every year by being on the side lines for weeks at a time. Yao dosent help either but its hard to keep really tall players healthy.    I cant wait until the 20th so I can watch Dallas beat up ont he Rockets in Houston.|`|aSE076PZaa	trade mccgrady to Lakers for odom and bynum|`|HDbMh2YBaa	I dont know but they have to do something. They have Yao and T Mac but they just cant get over the hump. Its amazing how good they we're with just T Mac last year. Then they get Yao and Artest and now they're just mediocre.     Maybe Yao is apart of the problem for all we know. I really cant say its the coach if he can lead a team to 20 straight wins without a top 5 center. Then I cant say its T Mac because he led them to that also. So its either Yao or Artest or both.

So he will probably take the night off early, and leave in the 2nd quarter.|`|jHJ0W9QNaa	yes, and Kobe Bryant will fake another injury by crashing his head into Pau Gasol's knee.

92jr44kFaa	I really don't suggest smoothbore, if they even make them anymore.  Your pellets need the spin that the rifled barrel gives them to stabilize during flight.

I'm sorry that I can't answer your question.|`|VgUAIvEUaa	no they are not the same for obvious reasons  why would you want a smoothbore air rifle shooting near the speed of sound? =/
j6R8OC7Vaa	That question is posted on the Celtics bulletin board in their locker room. And the answer is MANIACAL INTENSITY FROM KEVIN GARNETT and a little from Boston Garden - they absolutely must have homecourt to win. If they do the series will be 4 close losses for the Cavs in Boston and 3 blowout wins at the Q. Of course, we actually don't know what the Cavs can really do in Boston. Game 1 of the season only showed that Boston could get outplayed badly and make a nice comeback at the end against a team that didn't have Mo Williams plugged in quite properly yet.|`|3teWTOPqaa	they won't|`|jHJ0W9QNaa	i think the Celtics are playing better than the Cavaliers. if they stay focused on playing defense and protecting against turnovers, they will be in the Finals for sure. i hope the Celtics add Stephon Marbury.|`|56Mb4BXIaa	by playing team ball like they usually do|`|jKOB7n35aa	Does everyone forget opening night? The Celtics destroyed the Cavs in that game. The Celtics are just as good as last year. Glen Davis replaced PJ with his great play this year, and Tony Allen replaced James Posey. The Celtics are still the best team in the NBA and the world will finally realize that after tonight's trouncing of the Fakers.|`|s2gRgCZvaa	for the celtics to win, they're going to need rondo to play balls out. they're going to need pierce to put the pressure on lebron by scoring like he did last year. they need kg to just be kg. they need ray allen to shoot at least 45% from the field. they also need at least one other guy, be it big baby or powe, to step up and get at least 10pts and 8 boards a night. if that happens the celtics win. i don't think it will, but it's very possible.|`|UxSF3Doaaa	Well, the Celtics are currently number one in their division!

May as well just declare roids legal in pro sports.|`|zMvGnlMraa	I dont think he took steriods, it was just his style of pitching that kept him around for long.  You could say the same about Jamie Moyer.  He's still pitching but I dont think he took steriods.  Ryan adapted as he got older and learned to throw different pitches, used more movement and honed in on location.  Clemens didnt want to do this so he just took steriods to keep his fastball fast.|`|KhBmlaefaa	Possibly. We will never know. I really don't care who took them. I really don't.|`|mqgS6Dfxaa	Hmmm Interesting.  He was teammates on the Rangers with Jose Canseco, Rafeal Palmeiro, Juan Gonzalez, and Sammy Sosa.  They could explain how he could pitch so good well into his 40's.|`|yk4S7uuraa	I highly doubt that. Nolan Ryan, no, he never did that. The man threw the ball 100 mph when he was younger. I remember seeing him in Game 3 of the 1969 NLCS (Mets vs. Braves @ Shea Stadium), no one was able to hit him that day, and Hank Aaron said so the day he went into the HOF.|`|AVeKMM5Taa	no its called PURE TALLENT  just like Babe Ruth [Happy 113 B-Day Babe]|`|ak5A435maa	i think the chances are zero, or else he would of got owned by Robin Ventura|`|d065d40a6781127c80dc5959554a2d4faa	I don't think he would have.     He stands so his in his stikeout total because he was wild too. The guy would bring fear into some hitters because they were afraid the next pitch could be in your ear.|`|xiAYqPHmaa	Nolan Ryan 1968-93  I think it is very unlikely that he took steroids.  Firstly, and most importantly he is a man of character (there is plenty who have testified to it).  I dont mean that a lot of people liked him, I mean who he is/was always, in public and private.  Character is the primary test.  In other wards, players who juice have low (no) character.  Clemens, for example, is an adulterer and had illicit relationships with minors (the country singer who said they were intimate when she was 16).  He doesnt have character, and isnt above using juice.  But since we can't actually know Ryan's character first hand I'll move on.  Ryan pitched in 4 centuries!  26 seasons.  That is a very long career plenty of time to rack up a lot of K's.  Even if he wasnt a strike out pitcher he would have a decent total.  For instance, Greg Maddox (22 seasons, groundball pitcher) only had 200 K's once, but he is tenth all time.  Clemens pitched in 24 seasons (3rd all time, 4672 K's) and Randy Johnson in 20 (2nd all time, 4789 K's).  Ryan was 21 his rookie year, Clemens about the same, and Randy 25.  I think if Johnson (who I have never heard implicated in any Roid scandal) had started sooner, he would have caught up with him.  Clemens also never had a 300 K season, Ryan had 6.  Ryan never had serious injury problems.  He pitched in 25 games or more in every season except 3.  That is remarkable.  Ryan was ridiculously fast and could get batters out just on speed.  His speed diminished in course of his career and he had to get people out with his head, not just his arm.  He was extremely wild early on, and he learned control which helped his effectiveness later.  He adapted well yet still pitching fast.  I read his book a few years ago, and if I recall correctly he began using a splitter which kept him effective later.  Ryan attributed a lot of his success and longevity to healthy living.  Eating right, working out and taking care of his body.  this was something he didnt do until about midway through his career.  He said it helped him remain healthy and helped his pitching a lot.  Unlike Clemens, Ryan's numbers, although still strong, tailed off at the end of his career.  Roger's noticably improved his last few seasons (not just by a little either).  Personally I dont think Roger juiced until his last few seasons.  He was always fairly dominant, but he didnt want to quit and needed boost, so his last few years were better than the previous ones (k's/9inn, whip, and era were much better '03-'06 than '99-03).  Anabolic steroids have been used since the '30s.  Basically anybody can be implicated after that.  I dont think that Roids were at all common until the '70s.  The "era" is undefined and vague.  Though there is no real starting year, and no real way to come up with one, it is commonly understood they were prominent in the late 80s and 90s.  I dont agree with Canseco that 85% were juicers at this time, but I think a majority isnt an unreasonable figure.  It has been documented that since foreign players are not tested, the vast majority are/were users.  It is common to look at anyone with any success in recent years as a likely juicer.  It is unfortunate that we have deal with this problem.  I was a fan of Ryan, I have read a lot of him and my opinion didnt use.   He is widely know as a man of a lot of character, that is the biggest testament to me.  Hopefully the other things mentioned strongly point in his favor.|`|3QELIOU7aa	What a dumb question.  So does this mean Randy Johnson and Jamie Moyer are on roids they actually pitched in the roid era.
0YSQXodaaa	I also heard of Love, Wallace, and Carter. (Love was mentioned in a news story that said maybe he "will get his shot" at All-Star Weekend... http://myespn.go.com/blogs/truehoop/0-38... )    Wallace and Carter, at this point, just seem to be fan suggestions, but I'm sure things are developing.    Other suggestions include Manu Ginobli and Steve Nash. Around the Horn mentioned Luc Richard Mbah-a-Moute by name... it seems like just a random name that they dropped when mentioning the contest, but it's almost so random that I want to believe that they have the inside tip.    At this point, no one has been mentioned directly as having agreed to the contest, but the names are floating around third-party sources. NBA.com doesn't even have the H-O-R-S-E section on their All-Star page, so I doubt that they'll have anything.|`|9uLnIc3Maa	the best possible matchup would be steve nash (he can kick it in the hoop from halfcourt) Kevin Love (fullcourt) and Kobe (just Nasty!)|`|21J0IIZbaa	No  Possible players involved:  Eric Gordon, Kevin Love (full court shots), Rasheed Wallace (left-handed shots), Vince Carter|`|Ga11Abmzaa	I do not think there is any competition of such name.|`|AA10498235	naw not yet.|`|S2H19uMBaa	no but i just found out about it, gonna be SIIIIICKK|`|lgB7SD46aa	MC,YS,TARZAN,KING,39 POINT FAILURE AND ME!

Where out|`|mnahpvtOaa	gas is good for some pistol but not all    electric is awesome period    spring is good for snipers and pistols    all round i would prob. have to say that electric is better than gas because u dont have to buy gass refills and it is also better that spring becasue it is faster
dzf27XkOaa	You will be lucky to get a mention on the sports news on Terrestrial, and I doubt if it will that much better for the Ashes either!!|`|iPByegdmaa	Watch West Indies vs England 1st Test - day 3 live streaming on TV  here--    http://livecricketgame.blogspot.com/2009...|`|bf85fc1fa1e258360c2abd654d161748aa	I've just checked my tv guide magazine and there doesn't seem to be, which is odd as there usually is a highlights show for all England test matches.|`|AA11088802	dont know|`|iIe763Rjaa	there is on sky sports!!!|`|89uHH1bxaa	Highlights @ http://cricket.awesomeandhot.com/ The newest video search engine
GWoW1o5oaa	Usually one or more wood plies are replaced with a fiberglass carbon fiber  or Kevlar cloth.  Some manufacturers add the fabric to make another layer.  Decks like the Revdeck are solid carbon fiber.      These decks usually cost 20-200% more than solid wood.|`|vuEyUbsgaa	they better and more improved
4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	For sure that looks a pretty cool Wrestlemania card with some interesting looking matches ! Any event that has Stone Cold in a match gets my vote and the WM card is well worth 9/10 !|`|mDuiiVN7aa	7/10|`|3svykAV3aa	ECW Championship should be Jack Swagger vs Tommy Dreamer....    I give it a 9.5 out of 10|`|K2nNTDqhaa	Its not bad but I think Orton will be involved in one way or another, Cena v Jericho is rumoured to happen as its reckoned that Orton will battle Stone Cold, I think JBL and HBK will be involved in the RAW title match, Taker may battle Umaga, Edge and Triple H looks a shoe in Kennedy will probably be in MITB.  The rest is pretty good though , cant wait to see who wins Mitb , have a feeling they may push Benjamin, they've been talkin about him as potential main event material for years.|`|ODogL6A5aa	Nice match card,but why would it be HHH v Big Show? Also change John Cena v Jericho to Cena v Orton and the ECW championship match to Dreamer v Swagger.|`|IIdhUedsaa	miz & morrison because they great skills  shelton benjamin because hes at the top of his game  ric flair  jack swagger shows effort  beth phonix shes stronger than both of them  jeff hardy cuz his has more skills and better moves  edge hell just cheat of course  scsa because he'll raise hell like always  HHH because he has the talent and strength  taker because he will retain the undefeat streak  john cena cuz he always win

That is messed up.    I give it a 8 out of 10.
4284e409c8e26999c7eb4ffd92352976aa	For sure that's an excellent Randy Orton tribute ! He's one of my favorite Superstars on Raw as he works an excellent style of technical powerhouse wrestling and is very talented on the mic.|`|Pvg6djVSaa	i really really liked it 9\10  he is one of my favourite wrestler|`|3svykAV3aa	5/5     Great Song and Matches|`|APiKyN3qaa	5 star one of the best I've seen|`|uomYVsiLaa	It sucks.Try doing a tribute to Bob Backlund or anther classic wrestler with class and not this fake *** garbage! It's like watching a circus act now. You can grab some footage of him wrestling the giant or Bret Hart.|`|c0b843402c3ee206a8f4d1dc3949a130aa	I love Orton   Nd After Watchin Dis...
