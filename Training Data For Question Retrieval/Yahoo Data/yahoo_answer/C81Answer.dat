A little research would show that. In 2007, individual income taxes collected were approximately $1.16 trillion.  The interest on the debt was approximately $430 billion. Additionally, since approximately 40% of the total government debt is held by the U.S. Government, a large portion of the $430 billion ends up being paid to the government.<br>  <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=203" rel="nofollow">http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/ir/ir_expense.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/repor...</a><br>  <br>  Also, AS REQUIRED BY LAW, the Federal Reserve must return excess earnings to the U.S. Treasury.  In 2007, the Federal Reserve collected approximately $40.3 billion on the U.S. Government debt that it holds.  It returned approximately $34.6 billion of that amount to the U.S. Treasury.<br>  <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/rptcongress/annual07/sec6/c3.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/...</a><br>  <br>  BTW, corporate taxes do not even cover defense spending.  In 2007, corporate income taxes were $370.2 billion.  The Department of Defense budget for 2007 was $471.5 billion.<br>  <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/comptroller/Docs/fy2007_greenbook.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.defenselink.mil/comptroller/D...</a><br>  Also, federal gas taxes are 18.4 cents per gallon and not 42 cents.  You may pay 42 cents per gallon IN YOUR STATE because every state also has a state gas tax and it varies by state. While the federal gas tax does go to road improvements, the Department of Transportation also needs additional funding beyond what is provided by the Highway Trust Fund.|`|X8CaMCe6aa	Fortunately, you have the choice to live somewhere else if you don't like the way our government is run, or the way you're taxed.

Obama has been president for less than two months how did he manage in that short period of time to become responsible for all the problems in our society? Don't you think your stretching it just a bit? In all of the government programs we have that are set up to help people in need there will be people who might abuse the system, but I wouldn't take away Unemployment or Medicaid or Disability because some people out there abuse the system.

Lets see you live with holes in your walls and rats an roaches and have you called rich. lets have your children have no presents for christmas and your kids wearing shoe from the salvation army that are either holey or to small. Lets have your kids live with no hot water to do  dishes and take a nice bath. Lets have your kids do homework by candlelight with no tv, dvd player, or radio. Lets have your kids wear dirty clothes because you don't have any quarters to clean your clothes. Lets see you pay your rent when your another $50.00 behind because your had pay for something else for your children. It must be nice that most rent these days are like $1000.00 a month when they get less then $500 a month. No beds, no curtains, no coats, no heat, no hot water, no car, no tv.

Because if this is a habit, she's probably been doing it for longer than the 50 days or so Obama has been in office.<br>  <br>  The few people I know that are on food stamps are the recently unemployed who subsist mostly on Ramen.|`|47xDpDXVaa	she probably wouldn't have a good appetite because everything else in her life sucks. her job probably isn't really making ends meet because she can't work the hours that she use to since her dead beat kid's father left her to raise her kid alone, while he's out dating another women. she probably wished she had that "typical" mom and dad family that everyone has with things to "show for"--but doesn't really have a choice now that her ex walked out on her and her kids life. she probably really wants to persue things and make it better..but to her, there is no way out of this poverty life that she is in-- she is NOT living a luxury life. never judge a book by its cover.|`|kHjO1xkNaa	I've never seen it; and I doubt you have.<br>  <br>  Please cite 3 cases where you saw it.<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  <br>  I was on welfare, and was suspended for telling the truth.<br>  I ate well at a church, but I developed quite a rapport with the members.

1KGXts5Daa	a jail only needs to hold someone who has been released on bail, bond, or "OR" (own recognizance) long enough to insure that they do not pose a potential threat to self, others, or public safety - typically this is related to individuals who have consumed alcohol or any other substance which jail staff feels still may be an impairment to them.<br>  <br>  it is common to hold an individual for up to 12 hours under such circumstances and re-assess for safe release.<br>  <br>  if, in the opinion of jail staff, the individual poses no such reason for concern they are released as soon as reasonably practical, after having completed their booking paperwork - typically within an hour or so.

Ele e sua amante, Clara Petacci, foram aprisionados e levados para o pelot?o de fuzilamento, após a derrota italiana na Segunda Guerra Mundial.|`|99461f078a2b574ed8099c1783ae1938aa	Foi o MUSSOLINI, N?O é?|`|AA10290845	Benito Amilcare Andrea Mussolini (Dovia di Predappio, 29 de Julho de 1883 — Giulino di Mezzegra, 28 de Abril de 1945) foi jornalista e político italiano. Governou com poderes ditadoriais a Itália, entre 1922 a 1943, autodenominando-se Il Duce, que significa em italiano "o condutor".<br>  Em 1919, fundou os Fasci Italiani di Combatimento, organiza??o que originaria, mais tarde, o Partido Fascista. Baseando-se numa filosofia política teoricamente socialista, conseguiu a ades?o dos militares descontentes e de grande parte da popula??o, alargou os quadros e a dimens?o do partido. Sua oratória era t?o notável &ndash possuía uma bela voz digna de um barítono – quanto seu uso eficaz de propaganda política. Após um período de grandes perturba??es políticas e sociais, período em que alcan?ou grande popularidade, guindou-se a chefe do partido (Duce), e em 1922 organizou a famosa marcha sobre Roma, um golpe de propaganda. O próprio Mussolini nem sequer estave presente, tendo chegado de combóio.<br>  <br>  Usando as suas milícias (chamadas de camicia nera, camisas negras) para instigar o terror e combater abertamente os socialistas, conseguiu que os poderes investidos o nomeassem para formar governo. Foi nomeado Primeiro Ministro pelo rei Vítor Manuel III, alcan?ando a maioria parlamentar e, consequentemente, poderes absolutos na governa??o do país.<br>  <br>  Logo após a sua subida ao poder, iniciou uma campanha de fanatiza??o que culminaria com o aumento do seu poder, devido à interdi??o dos restantes partidos políticos e sindicatos. Nessa companha foi apoiado pela burguesia e pela Igreja. Em 1929, necessitando de apoio desta e dos católicos, p?s fim à Quest?o Romana (conflito entre os Papas e o Estado italiano) assinando a Concordata de S?o Jo?o Latr?o com Pio XI. Por esse tratado, firmou-se um acordo pelo qual se criava o Estado do Vaticano, o Sumo Pontífice recebia indeniza??o monetária pelas perdas territoriais, o ensino religioso era obrigatório nas escolas italianas, o catolicismo virava a religi?o oficial da Itália e se proibia a admiss?o em cargos públicos dos sacerdotes que abandonassem a batina. Em 1935, invadiu a Abissínia (atual Etiópia), perdendo assim o apoio da Fran?a e da Inglaterra, até ent?o seus aliados políticos. Esta campanha militar fez mais de meio milh?o de mortos entre os africanos, face a cerca de 5.000 baixas do lado italiano. Foram usadas armas químicas contra a popula??o local, um facto que n?o foi noticiado na imprensa italiana, controlado por Mussolini.<br>  <br>  Somente ent?o aliou-se de fato a Adolf Hitler, com quem firmaria vários tratados. Em 1936, assinou com o Führer e com o Jap?o o Pacto Tripartite, pelo qual Alemanha, Itália e Jap?o formavam uma alian?a político-militar que levaria o mundo à Segunda Guerra Mundial.<br>  <br>  Em 1938 ocupou a Albania e enviou vários destacamentos que lutaram ao lado dos falangistas de Franco durante a Guerra Civil de Espanha. Em seguida, fez os exércitos italianos atacarem a Grécia – apenas para serem expulsos em oito dias. Com o início da Segunda Guerra Mundial combateu os aliados e, após várias e quase consecutivas derrotas, apesar do apoio militar alem?o e sobretudo depois do desembarque aliado na Sicília, caiu em desgra?a, vindo a ser derrubado e preso em 1943.<br>  <br>  Libertado pelos para-quedistas SS alem?es do Hotel/pris?o de Gran Sasso, tentaria ainda fundar a República Social Italiana, ao Norte do país, mas pouco depois viria a ser novamente preso por guerrilheiros da resistência italiana, que o fuzilaram a 28 de abril de 1945, juntamente com a sua companheira, Clara Petacci – que embora pudesse fugir, preferiu permanecer ao lado do Duce até o fim. As útimas palavras deste – em óbvia deferência à sua personalidade egocêntrica – foram: "Atirem aqui" (disse ele apontando o peito). "N?o destruam meu perfil". O seu corpo e o de Clara ficaram expostos à execra??o pública durante vários dias, numa pra?a de Mil?o.<br>   Mussulini deixou a esposa Donna Rachele Mussolini, 2 filhos, Vittorio and Romano Mussolini, e a filha Edda, viuva do Conde Ciano and Anna Maria. O terceiro filho, Bruno, foi morto em um acidente aerio pilotando um bombardeiro em faze de teste P108 em 7 Agosto de 1941. Mussolini's neta Alessandra Mussolini, filha de  Romano Mussolini, e hoje menbra do partido neo facista ,outros relativos de Edda (Castrianni) mudaram para a Inglaterra apos o final da segunda guerra mundial.

Everyone on the UN Security Council save the US has condemned the Isreali action, why would Iran have to do anything else?

I'm therefore going to spend more money on duct tape this weekend than I probably have over the entire course of my life. I'll tell you why: Molli's in motion.<br>  <br>  She's obviously not walking yet, or even crawling, but she's integrated a certain amount of wriggling and creeping into her old routine of rolling and spinning. On top of this, she's also developed a capacity for propping herself up on all fours, extending her upward reach an additional twelve inches or so and allowing her to aim herself in any direction without any forward or lateral movement. Add that all up and you've got a kid who's suddenly capable of moving halfway across a room in the time it takes you to run into the kitchen, grab a handful of paper towels, and realize you never should have left her alone in the other room.<br>  <br>  This morning, for example, Molli was happily bashing the brains out of one of her toys in the middle of the living room when I heard my water boiling in the kitchen. I hurried into the kitchen, prepared a cup of instant coffee, then moved briskly back into the living room. Molli was a full five feet from where she'd been and was doing her best either to pull herself up into her old bassinet or pull the damn thing down on top of her. (I couldn't tell, and even if I'd asked, her answer almost certainly would have been "ba!")<br>  <br>  Total time elapsed was—well, that's the problem. No time elapsed. Zero. I don't know how she did it. I don't know why she did it. I only know that the energy, enthusiasm, and curiosity that were always so delighful in our daughter are suddenly ominous and horrifying. This appears to be the part of Molli's development where I learn (again) just how wrong I was to think she couldn't possibly demand any more of my attention than she already does.<br>  <br>  This seems to be a critical juncture. Up to now she's been largely stationary, rarely moving more than a foot or two off her play blanket. There's a set of appropriate parental behaviors for this level of infant (im)mobility, and the rules aren't hard to follow: keep an eye on the kid, keep all potentially dangerous stuff (i.e., anything that isn't made out of stain-resistant cotton or chewable plastic) at least three feet away from her, and listen very carefully whenever you're out of the room. But try not to spend too much time out of the room.<br>  <br>  In the very near future, she's going to be extremely mobile, capable of wandering anywhere we haven't walled or fenced off completely. She may crawl tonight or she may not crawl until April, but I can't imagine there will be any further warning signs before the crawling begins, so we have to act as though she were capable of crawling already. (While we were in the states my sister observed Molli's then-primitive efforts at getting up on all fours and flatly declared, "she'll crawl in a month." That was about three weeks ago.) I'd been wondering what that playpen was for. . . we've mostly been using it as a toy chest. Suddenly that little Alcatraz makes a lot more sense—it'll certainly be a lot easier to dump Molli in there than to duct tape her down to the floor every time I have to go to the bathroom.<br>  <br>  I may be mistaken in thinking Molli's about to crawl, but here's what we're looking at: she can roll from her back to her stomach and vice-versa, in either direction, at will. She can propel herself backwards with surprising speed, on surfaces that don't offer significant traction, merely by pushing off the floor with her hands. She can turn in circles, as I mentioned before, by propping herself up on her arms, twisting her body, and crossing her arms one over the other to swing herself around. When lying on her stomach in front of the various bits of furniture in our living room, she'll reach out, grasp the furniture as best she can, and attempt to raise herself up on it. She frequently draws herself up onto all fours, knees beneath her rump, and sways back and forth. She even tries to crawl, moving her legs in what appears to be the appropriate motion—but without using her arms to give her the last bit of assistance she needs to defeat the forces of gravity and inertia that have until now kept her in check. As far as I can tell, once she figures out that bit about the arms there's nothing left to stop her.<br>  <br>  Oh—she figured something else out, too, although I've got no idea how. The other night I left her in her bouncy chair for a moment, in the middle of the living room, to finish preparing her dinner in the kitchen. Trine was already in the kitchen working on our own dinner. A moment later Trine wandered off into the living room with the salad or something. I followed a second behind her. Trine was frozen in her tracks, salad bowl in hand, staring down at Molli.<br>  <br>  Molli was creeping around the hardwood floor about a meter away from her bouncy chair. I thought it was strange that Trine would have set the salad down on the floor, picked Molli up out of the seat, set her down on the hardwood floor instead of her play blanket, then picked the salad back up again and stood there watching our daughter vie for splinters. But before I had the chance to articulate my confusion, Trine turned to me and asked:<br>  <br>  "Did you take her out of her seat?"<br>  <br>  I suppose it's not surprising that Molli should have found a way out of the seat. I normally do buckle her in, but sometimes, when I've just plunked her down for a moment and then need to run out of the room for a second, I don't actually clip her in until I've returned. <br>  <br>  What's surprising is the stealth and silence with which she did it. Believe me, my ears and Trine's are tuned to pick up the slightest bump or thunk from an unattended Molli, and there simply hadn't been any. Somehow the sneaky little demon child had slipped out of her seat and onto the floor without making a sound.<br>  <br>  So on the one hand it's a very exciting time for us: our leaky little bundle of babbling flesh is about to become mobile. On the other hand... well, there is no other hand. We're screwed.<br>  <br>  Clearly we're going to have to spend some time this weekend babyproofing the living room and fencing it off from the rest of the apartment. And we're going to have to do something about our beautiful, unfinished hardwood floors, which I loved when we moved in (you can actually smell the wood), but which now strike me as so many splinters waiting to happen.<br>  <br>  And we're gonna have to buy a lot of duct tape.<br>  <br>  I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, "Moron, you can't duct tape an infant! This is the modern era, and one simply doesn't do that kind of thing. Why, just think of the advances being made in velcro technology!" <br>  <br>  Believe me, I've given the velcro option a lot of thought. It has a lot of advantages over duct tape, not least of which being the ability to attach and detach the infant to pre-established docking points with relative ease. (To say nothing of the absence of gummy residue.)<br>  <br>  But in the end, you still have to attach to attach the velcro to the infant, and this is usually done by means of ordinary adhesive anyway—and anyone who's worked with do-it-yourself velcro projects in the past will tell you that the adhesive on the back of those velcro strips ain't got nothin' on the adhesive properties of duct tape.<br>  <br>  My father wasted years of his life trying to teach me that anything worth doing was worth doing with duct tape. It's time to take his advice.<br>  <br>  Chapmania<br>  <br>  John Chapman was born in Massachusetts in 1774. Growing up during the formative years of American history, Mr Chapman became a fervent patriot with a passion for the welfare of his country. It was a country he loved in every respect but one: it was, he felt, insufficiently appled.<br>  <br>  As soon as he was old enough, Mr Chapman ran for congress on a platform of More Apples. The electorate, alas, was already divided between Hamiltonian Federalists and Jeffersonian Republicans, leaving little room for Apple-Happy Chapmaniacs.<br>  <br>  Being an American, Mr Chapman decided to take matters into his own hands. He kicked off his shoes, made himself new clothes from old sacks, and began wearing a tin pot for a hat (thereby becoming the spiritual founding father of the Reform Party). Instead of seeking office again, however, Mr Chapman began a grassroots campaign to spread his More Apples policy.<br>  <br>  He changed his name to Johnny Appleseed and went to work.<br>  <br>  He wandered the wilds of Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, seeding the earth with apple trees. <br>  <br>  Eventually he got sick and died on this very day in 1845.<br>  <br>  Borscht Boy<br>  <br>  At the end of the second world war, America dropped two atomic bombs on Japan. Each bomb killed so many people so quickly and made the world so safe for peace-loving democracies that America began feeling pretty good about things and forgot all about being Depressed, etc. This caused the hula-hoop, the soda fountain, and Annette Funicello. <br>  <br>  Not everyone could master the hula-hoop, however, and the alienation experienced by those who couldn't resulted in the development of an American counterculture.<br>  <br>  Scoffing the traditional values of mainstream America, the counterculturalists experimented with bold new ideas. They forsook the established middle-class pleasures, such as wine, woman, and song, in favor of radical new ones, such as sex, drugs, and rock'n'roll.<br>  <br>  Born 83 years ago March 12, Jack Kerouac was a child of the Depression and a veteran of the second world war. He was therefore torn between these competing value systems and roamed the country aimlessly in search of grammar and punctuation. <br>  <br>  The adventures described in On the Road were based loosely on his real-life travels with the infamous Ken Kesey and his band of Merry Pranksters, whose insatiable appetite for borscht led Kerouac to dub them "The Beet Generation."<br>  <br>  You can read my own version of On the Road, which includes—er, consists of—the longest sentence ever published in a work of American non-fiction, by purchasing my goddam book (The 5-Minute Iliad and Other Instant Classics: Great Books for the Short Attention Span), which might still be available from your favorite bookseller.<br>  <br>  Also<br>  <br>  March 13 is the birthday of L. Ron Hubbard (the "L" is silent). Mr. Hubbard invented Dianetics, which eventually led to Scientology, causing Scientologists and Personality Tests. Scientologists are easily distinguished from Jehovah's Witnesses in that they don't ask you subscribe to The Watchtower and can often be seen in major motion pictures.<br>  <br>  Standard time was established in the United States on March 13, 1884. Standard time was not well received at first. Americans were outraged at the soul-deadening conformity imposed by this new standard, an infringement on the natural liberties of a free people, and—look! A squirrel!

First "W" has said repeatedly that prisoners of his war on terror do not qualify for the Geneva convention and that GitMo was chosen specifically because of its geographical location, Second,the war on Terror ended when monkey boy said "mishon ecomplisht" the occupation has since done more to inspire hate for America and her interests than any one thing in history except maybe Hiroshima, Torture is illegal because it violates Human Rights.. weather or not you feel that "lefties" are whiners has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that George W Bush and Darth Cheney have violated every ideal of a free and Democratic people.

1f7f75a09c354e48cbc6c51eb1c987e2aa	PROBLEMA<br>  No Brasil ocorre o maior estelionato fiscal do mundo:<br>  ? De cada R$200 que saem do bolso do empregador em dire??o ao bolso do empregado, R$100 s?o pagos na forma de encargos sociais, nem mesmo entram no contracheque do empregado<br>  ? Dos R$100 que sobram e aparecem no contracheque, R$60 s?o usados para pagar tributos;<br>  ? Sobram R$40, que s?o ent?o utilizados para comprar, saúde, educa??o, seguran?a, etc ...<br>  ? ... que o Estado (nas esferas federal , estadual e municipal) deveria prover, com os R$160 que retém !<br>  <br>  Na Suécia os impostos também s?o altos. Mas lá, dá gosto pagá-los! Saúde e educa??o, por exemplo, s?o integralmente públicos e s?o os melhores servi?os do mundo.<br>  <br>  CAUSAS<br>  ? O Brasil é o único país do mundo em que as três esferas do poder (federal , estadual e municipal) cobram tributos; por exemplo, nos EUA apenas as duas primeiras e na Fran?a apenas a 1a e a 3a esferas cobram tributos;<br>  ? Os tributos n?o s?o vinculados. Ou seja, os detentores do poder usam o que arrecadam como bem querem. O único tributo vinculado era a CPMF, na época em que era provisória. A Constitui??o Federal proibia a multi-tributa??o que é a CPMF, mas admitia, se o tributo fosse vinculado e temporário. A CPMF foi criada temporária e vinculada à saúde, mas NUNCA foi usada para esse fim. Por fim, a Constitui??o foi violentada e a CPMF foi desvinculada e tornada PERMANENTE;<br>  ? Muito do que se arrecada se perde em falcatruas executadas pela própria sociedade;<br>  ? Muito mais ainda é utilizado para pagar servi?o de uma dívida externa que nunca se reduz; o falecido Brizola ficou famoso por sempre alertar sobre as perdas internacionais.<br>  <br>  PORQUE é DIFíCIL MUDAR<br>  ? Os detentores do poder (executivo, legislativo e judiciário) n?o s?o marcianos, nem suecos. S?o todos brasileiros.<br>  ? Quando alguém tenta fazer alguma coisa, n?o apenas desacreditam o autor da idéia como também fazem morrer a própria idéia. Exemplo: alguém lembra do imposto único? Os autores sumiram (foram corrompidos?) e a idéia morreu.<br>  ? O poder realmente corrompe. O PT, antes, só atirava pedras.

Portugal n?o deixava chegar nada aqui, sem cobrar impostos de importa??o, que iam para Lisboa sustentar a ociosidade de sua elite real. Depois, os ingleses nos invadiram com suas empresas e Portugal come?ou a cobrar impostos de tudo o que era jeito. O movimento de Tiradentes deu no que deu exatamente por isso. Nosso povo sofria muito e aprendia que iimpostos eram para sustentar a classe alta de Portugal. Depois da independência, o povo continuou a pagar impostos altissimos só que agora para sustentar as novas classes ricas de nosso pais. Fazendeiros, militares, agricultores que passaram a ter seus representantes na cúpula da república. E o povo brasileiro entende que isto é normal. Bem, chegamos até agora da mesma forma. Nada disto foi criado nem por Fernando Henrique, nem por Lula. Isto é um cancro (doen?a venerea) que atinge todos nós. Estamos sob o dominio de uma máquina de governo que n?o tem ética, que se dá aumento, mordomias, falcatruas, etc. dentro da maior legalidade, pois s?o eles que fazem as suas próprias leis. Esta bagun?a vem de muitas décadas. Só que vai aumentando e precisando de cada vez mais dinheiro. E aumentam criativamente novos impostos, taxas, etc. e nós n?o temos for?a de reagir. Até porque eu dúvido que vc conhe?a algum politico na nossa história, que tenha lutado para acabar ou diminuir isto. Nem os militares quiseram mexer nisto. Porque isto seria mexer com eles mesmos e seus atuais amigos seriam seus futuros inimigos. Diminuir o tamanho do Estado, seus custos, sua inoperancia, nem pensar. Alias, quem tentou um pouco foi o Collor  e viu no que deu? E nosso povo é muito ignorante, n?o entende e nem quer entender. O Tiradentes foi considerado o maior bandido da história do Brasil, você sabia? Só cem anos depois é que descobriram que n?o era bem assim e o colocaram como herói.

2b6ecc95584dc639f70afa73eb3f44a4aa	Racism goes way beyond the words that we use on each other or the misguided belief that we are solely entitled to land that we own because we murdered the people that lived here and took it. We are all guilty of it. Do you remember how it felt watching people die during the 9/11 attacks? How the whole country felt about the taking of 3000 innocent lives? It was often described as the worst act of terrorism in history. Now look at the Middle East. They are killing each other by the droves over there and we don't really care. It's just some Arabs to us. The genocide going on over in Darfur makes us yawn. Boring. Its something that we are all guilty of.

The reason the two parties seem to have similar beliefs is because that's how the media portrays them.  Actually, they are very different.  Use your keyword search and type in Politics1.  Click on Political Parties.  You can view the beliefs of all the parties that currently exist in the United States.  Nope, you've got to go beyond what the media give you.

d939382901c451bef052c1e09eb74dd1aa	The Marshall Plan, known officially following its enactment as the European Recovery Program (ERP), was the primary plan of the United States for rebuilding the allied countries of Europe and repelling communism after World War II. The initiative was named for United States Secretary of State George Marshall and was largely the creation of State Department officials, especially William L. Clayton and George F. Kennan.<br>  <br>  The reconstruction plan was developed at a meeting of the participating European states in July 1947. The Marshall Plan offered the same aid to the Soviet Union and its allies, if they would make political reforms and accept certain outside controls. In fact, America worried that the Soviet Union would take advantage of the plan and therefore made the terms deliberately hard for the USSR to accept. The plan was in operation for four fiscal years beginning in July 1947. During that period some $13 billion of economic and technical assistance, equivalent to around $130 billion in 2006, when adjusted for inflation, was given to help the recovery of the European countries which had joined in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.<br>  <br>  By the time the plan had come to completion, the economy of every participant state, with the exception of Germany, had grown well past pre-war levels. Over the next two decades, Western Europe as a whole would enjoy unprecedented growth and prosperity. The Marshall Plan has also long been seen as one of the first elements of European integration, as it erased tariff trade barriers and set up institutions to coordinate the economy on a continental level. An intended consequence was the systematic adoption of American managerial techniques.<br>  <br>  In recent years historians have questioned both the underlying motivation and the overall effectiveness of the Marshall Plan. Some historians now believe that the benefits of the Marshall Plan actually were the result of new laissez faire policies that allowed for markets to stabilize through economic growth. Furthermore, some criticize the plan for establishing a precedent of solving the problem of failing economies abroad by offering aid from US taxpayers|`|c4e521f69dcfb064634d93858448f62daa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Plan" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall_Pl...</a>|`|AA10917838	Marchal Plan was a pure ivestment and econimical plan .. to help in the huge reconnstruction of whole Europe .. it had nothing to do with Israel|`|44dfa08514f455813f04c2111f71cf11aa	It was initially a massive cash injection for Western European countries in the aftermath of WW2.America was worried about Russia encroaching upon Europe which it had started to do.<br>  But it wasn't all charity as it also boosted sales of American products .<br>  So I suppose it was a good thing for all sides in the end.

We're too busy with our own agenda to band together to ever get our country back. <br>  <br>  When the American banking system broke the american family farms system with their intentional depression ( I only say this because the overmonied weren't phased by it , as were the working class), they created a system where our time would be so splintered, we wouldn't have the energy or desire to fight for the principals that made our country great. <br>  <br>  Instead, we work, we put up with our bosses crap and by the time we hit the front door to our tiny bank-owned home, we're too tired to do much of anything except grab a cold (fill in the blank) and either park our butts in front of the TV or computer and vegetate. <br>  <br>  My grandmothers family signed a document that stated they would stand together with Thomas Jefferson and our other forefathers before our Declaration of Independence was written.  I am sure they are looking down in shame at what a lazy, listless, couch slug their offspring has become.<br>  <br>  I agree wholeheartedly with your comment about "daddy's boy".

461930e206725e96eac73c7f11ad0eaaaa	Sadly, I have to say that you are right...we do look elsewhere for reasons for our failures.  However, it was not always this way.<br>  <br>  Not that many generations ago, we were a nation of independent people capable of crossing the country in a covered wagon.  Can you imagine that happening today...without lawsuits, I mean?<br>  <br>  Personally, I think it all started going downhill in the late 30s, with the introduction of government-funded social programs; combined with the previous institution of the Income Tax, this gave the Government not only a nice petty cash pile, but authority to dole it out at will.<br>  <br>  Over the ensuing decades, we became less and less ashamed to take Government relief; and less and less willing to accept responsibility.<br>  <br>  I feel that was what set the stage for the appalling Me generation;  a whole decade of kids born and raised without accountability, who have raised their kids the same way.<br>  <br>  It's a pity, really, there aren't more people willing to scrutinize their behavior and see that their actions (particularly in regard to their children) are directly to blame.<br>  <br>  This is a depressing topic, isn't it?|`|AA11201933	3)  There is a steady increase in home schooling.

For example, who cares if someone tries to sue the fastfood companies? They arnt going to win anymore. Who cares if people die from lung cancer, they decided to smoke! <br>  <br>  but, I think there are some questions that need to be actually addressed. like Immigration. Immigrants trash our borders, destroy property.. etc.. and live off of our tax money. Yet, there are still people who think they have rights. <br>  <br>  I think that sometimes it is Other's fault for our problems..

I believe to some degree, its human nature, rooted in tribalism to want to blame others. Mind you I remember my grandparents and even parents generation (I'm over 50) as being a little more "suck it up and take the consequences". There is no longer a community involved in the upbringing of children so there is no cross section of varying adult/parent influences any longer. Little censure and accountability may exist if it is only the nuclear family parents that is involved in child rearing. The absence of community also influences the sense that there are few checking out one's behaviour. Add to that the distorted views displayed through ever more sophisticated media. Then lets not talk about the legal system and insurance companies that have greed motivating them - not accountability.|`|7661dba85e0c1df07da77d3e09b2997aaa	Honestly, My opinion is that we have all lied to ourselves for so long we can't take responsibility for the fact we have been doing so. NOT blaming someone else means having to blame yourself. and blaming yourself means you must take responsibility for correcting the situation OR the face the consequences of not doing anything to correct the situation. As long as we blame others, WE don't have to face the fact we caused the situation and even more important we don't have to expend the energy to correct it.

Most republicans would tell you it cause of weapons of mass destruction well there any none . And they blame Clinton for the attacks when he did all he can . Clintons not as rich as Bush and doesnt have many connections like Bush does . Why are Gas prices so high well cause were paying to have Troops die for oil and the price it cost to bring oil back to united states.

Em Berlim, todas as pessoas eram cadastradas*(2 milh?es de pessoas), A policia sabia onde eu morava, estudava e me divertia. Parece loucura... todavia, nos 5 anos que passei lá, nunca soube de um único assalto ou crime. Uma vez, estudando para uma prova,  esqueci de renovar meus dados na polícia. 24 horas depois a polícia foi ver o q estava havendo.<br>  Funciona.<br>  <br>  Cadastrar 8 milh?es de pessoas...é o caminho mais fácil de localizar os bandidos do Rio.<br>  Se a pessoa for localizada pela camera e n?o estiver no sistema... bingo!<br>  <br>  De pior cidade do Brasil... o Rio pode vir a ser a capital digital e a mais segura do país.

S?o corruptos desde a primeira campanha eleitoral, quando "enganaram" milhares de eleitores, também ladr?es virtuais de latas de sardinhas, que esperam ser bem representados pelos seus eleitos, no mínimo, institucionalizar os pequenos furtos. Esses dois tipos de contraventores parecem diferentes, contudo um dificilmente vive sem o outro. Uma boa parte da popula??o brasileira, sem dúvida, é tendenciosa. Podemos observar as atua??es dos membros do nosso Congresso Nacional que deveriam cumprir o real papel para qual foram eleitos e n?o roubarem e atrapalharem os bem intencionados que querem trabalhar.

LEIA ENT?O APENAS O COME?O E VC. VAI ENTENDER TUDINHO..... <br>  <br>  Fonte(s):<br>  <br>  Há tempos, pede-se a abertura da Caixa Preta da imprensa brasileira. Nenhum cidad?o razoavelmente inteligente pode acreditar que a violenta campanha para derrubar o Presidente Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva seja realizada por jornalistas somente seduzidos pela doutrina neoliberal e conservadora difundida pelos quadros intelectuais da elite brasileira.<br>  <br>  Há muito dinheiro correndo nos túneis subterraneos do Golpe de Estado em curso no Brasil. Boa parte desse dinheiro se destina a abastecer os jornalistas e formadores de opini?o recrutados pelo Grupo Rio.<br>  <br>  Investiga??es independentes, realizadas de Setembro de 2005 a Mar?o de 2006, revelam que pelo menos 76 pessoas, entre jornalistas e outras personalidades, foram agraciados por suas contribui??es ao Golpe de Estado.<br>  Certamente, há os que nada cobram, que se juntam à sedi??o por motivos particulares ou por investirem em benefícios futuros.<br>  <br>  Os bancos Nossa Caixa, Bank of Boston e Santander Banespa tem sido os principais canais de repasse para a maior parte desses profissionais de duplo emprego.<br>  <br>  Quem s?o os jornalistas empenhados em instaurar o terror no País<br>  <br>  A legi?o de colaboradores do Golpe de Estado se divide em três frentes diferentes na mídia: 1) Jornalistas da grande imprensa; 2) Blogueiros e articulistas "independentes"; 3) Formadores de opini?o (analistas políticos, artistas, etc...)<br>  <br>  Os primeiros tratam de ecoar tudo que é supostamente negativo no governo do Presidente Lula. Exageram, ofendem, instauram suspeitas e, a todo custo, recorrem ao moralismo rasteiro para provocar indigna??o nos cidad?os. é o caso do jornalista Ricardo Noblat.<br>  <br>  Os segundos s?o utilizados geralmente para divulgar informa??es falsas, parte da estratégia de terror utilizada na desestabiliza??o do País. Por serem menos facilmente enquadráveis, realizam o trabalho sujo de polui??o informativa. é o caso de Claudio Humberto.<br>  <br>  Os terceiros s?o cooptados das mais diferentes formas, nem sempre presenteados com dinheiro. Na farsa midiática, servem para criar uma ilus?o de caos institucional, de decep??o geral e indigna??o contra o governo. é o caso do ator Lima Duarte, tradicionalmente ligado ao tucanismo; de um conhecido humorista; do deputado Fernando Gabeira; do presidente da OAB (Ordem dos Advogados do Brasil), de Roberto Busato, a quem foi prometido o cargo de Ministro da Justi?a em eventual futuro governo do PSDB-PFL; do "oabista" Orlando Maluf Haddad, cuja má índole é equivalente a sua capacidade de acumular patrim?nio; e da analista de assuntos políticos Lucia Hipólito.<br>  <br>  Como ganhar dinheiro fácil <br>  <br>  Para alguns desses jornalistas e formadores de opini?o, o ofício sempre foi uma prática de comércio apartada de valores morais ou de condutas éticas. é o caso do "empoado" Augusto Nunes, do Jornal do Brasil, e de Eurípedes Alcantara, da revista Veja.<br>  <br>  O segundo esteve inúmeras vezes nos Estados Unidos, sempre participando de simpósios do Departamento de Estado e do Departamento de Defesa para jornalistas latino-americanos alinhados com as políticas de Washington. Logicamente, Alcantara sempre foi retribuído por suas a??es no sentido de desmoralizar qualquer projeto ou personalidade da esquerda no Brasil.<br>  <br>  O Departamento de Defesa dos Estados Unidos reproduz uma conversa telef?nica entre Alcantara e Donald Rumsfeld.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/transcripts/2..." rel="nofollow">http://www.defenselink.mil/transcripts/2...</a><br>  <br>  Um pequeno e c?mico trecho mostra o tipo de jornalismo produzido pelo escoteiro de Roberto Civita.<br>  <br>  QUESTION (Alcantara): Yeah, that would be my pleasure. I have been watching close your role in the United States and I must say that I admire you. You are so firm since the beginning. When they said they were going there for the oil and then they said you were going there for your own interests, and then, well, we see democracy spreading throughout the Arab world. This is not a small thing, right?<br>  <br>  Outros jornalistas têm servido com fidelidade aos articuladores do Golpe de Estado, como o blogueiro Fernando Rodrigues e o articulista Merval Pereira. A norma é simples. Negar ou criticar qualquer sucesso da administra??o de Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Os sucessos na Educa??o, como o Prouni, e na promo??o social, como o Bolsa Família, devem ser ignorados ou tratados com ironia ácida. Toda suspeita deve ser concebida como verdade. Tudo que representar dano à reputa??o do presidente e de seu partido deve ser ampliado, se possível em tom de indigna??o cívica. No plano das alian?as, referências à Venezuela e a Hugo Chávez devem ser sempre negativas. <br>  <br>  Os comentaristas e analistas seguem a mesma cartilha (um conjunto informal de orienta??es conhecido como Bola7), produzida sob coordena??o do publicitário Paschoal Fabra Neto. é o caso de Luciano Dias, do IBEP, aluno obediente do Grupo Rio. Vale acompanhar seu torto pensamento, expresso no UOL (servi?o do Internet do jornal Folha de S. Paulo).<br>  <br>  "De acordo com Dias, é irrelevante se o caseiro foi ou n?o comprado para desmentir Palocci."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://noticias.uol.com.br/uolnews/brasi..." rel="nofollow">http://noticias.uol.com.br/uolnews/brasi...</a><br>  <br>  O jogo das contas bancárias milagrosas<br>  <br>  Ricardo Noblat, Fernando Rodrigues, Claudio Humberto, Augusto Nunes, Merval Pereira, Otavio Cabral, Lucia Hipolito, Luciano Dias, Lilian Witte Fibe, Mauro Calliari, Eurípedes Alcantara, Mario Sabino, André Petry, Diogo Mainardi, entre outros, n?o citados porque se beneficiam de nossas incertezas, figuram entre os alegres ganhadores da loteria do golpe. Cabe aos bons jornalistas, descobrir quem os tem premiado.<br>  <br>  * Para facilitar o trabalho, apresentamos alguns dados fundamentais: R$ 76 mil entre 10/2005 e 03/2006; R$ 234 mil entre 07/2005 e 03/2006; R$ 450 mil entre 08/2005 e 03/2006; R$ 34 mil entre 07/2005 e 03/2006; R$ 906 mil entre 06/2005 e 03/2006; R$ 54 mil (em 10 parcelas) entre 05/2006 e 02/2006; R$ 111 mil entre 08/2005 e 03/2006; R$ 432 mil entre 10/2005 e 03/2006; R$ 454 mil entre 10/2005 e 03/2006; R$ 32 mil entre 08/2005 e 03/2006; R$ 321 mil em 12/2005; R$ 98 mil entre 07/2005 e 03/2006; R$ 132 mil entre 10/2005 e 03/2006; R$ 42 mil entre 10/2005 e 03/2006.<br>  <br>  Interessante é que idêntico sistema de compra seletiva de jornalistas e comunicadores tem sido registrado na Venezuela, no Paraguai e, mais recentemente, no Peru. A compara??o nas metodologias nos permite deduzir que há uma inteligência operativa internacional por trás dos projetos de desestabiliza??o de governos.<br>  <br>  * Dados obtidos sem conhecimento do governo federal, a partir de esfor?os de reportagem de ex-integrantes do Prime Suspectz, hoje voluntários do JIBRA.<br>  <br>  Como corromper um caseiro<br>  <br>  A primeira tentativa foi comprar um par de belas garotas de programa de Brasília. Como elas s?o decentes, negaram-se a servir ao Grupo Rio. A idéia seguinte foi instrumentalizar o caseiro Francenildo Costa. Mas de onde veio a inspira??o? O senador Antero Paes de Barros (PSDB-MT) a recebeu de seu compadre e financiador, o mega gangster "Comendador Jo?o Arcanjo", que já havia se utilizado de expediente semelhante para destruir uma figura pública em seu Estado.<br>  <br>  Líder do crime organizado no Centro-Oeste do Brasil, o "Comendador" é, desde 1994, um dos principais sócios do PSDB na regi?o. O bolachudo Antero Paes de Barros, por exemplo, recebeu em 2002 pelo menos 84 cheques de uma factoring do bicheiro. O "Comendador" Arcanjo, sempre protegido pelo PSDB local, é acusado de ser o mandante do assassinato de mais de 30 pessoas e da mutila??o punitiva de outras 50 pessoas.<br>  <br>  Crime e acobertamento: tradi??o do PSDB<br>  <br>  As liga??es do "Comendador" com o PSDB n?o representam novidade. No Amazonas, o senador tucano Arthur Virgílio é conhecido por suas liga??es excêntricas com a explora??o de menores. Em Manaus, inúmeras testemunhas confirmaram as denúncias contra o senador. A imprensa do Brasil, no entanto, finge que nunca ouviu falar do assunto. Poucos sabem dos esfor?os de Virgílio para salvar Omar Aziz (PFL) na CPI da Explora??o Sexual de Crian?as e Adolescentes.<br>  <br>  Quem compra os jornalistas<br>  <br>  O sistema criado pelo PSDB e pelo PFL para a compra de jornalistas é antigo. Seu idealizador foi o falecido ministro Sérgio Motta, o Serj?o, responsável por enorme série de falcatruas no reinado de Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Segundo ele, a imprensa "comia na m?o se farto fosse o gr?o". <br>  <br>  Serj?o fez escola, gerando uma série de articuladores de "contratos" com a imprensa. Hoje, alguns militam nas fileiras de José Serra. Outros, no bando do ex-governador alquimista da Opus Dei.<br>  <br>  Pode-se dizer que boa parte das compras de jornalistas efetuadas na grande imprensa teve como articulador o diretor financeiro do Instituto Sérgio Motta, Vladimir Antonio Rioli. Ex-sócio de José Serra, parceiro do ex-prefeito na prática costumeira do delito, Rioli é conhecido por sua folha corrida.<br>  <br>  See more:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.terra.com.br/istoe/1704/brasi..." rel="nofollow">http://www.terra.com.br/istoe/1704/brasi...</a><br>  <br>  Rioli, já condenado pela Justi?a Federal, tem sido tradicional interlocutor tucano em negocia??es com a Editora Abril, de Roberto Civita, e o Grupo Folha, de Otávio Frias.<br>  <br>  Details: Processo 2002.34.00.029731-6. Referência: <a href="http://conjur.estadao.com.br/static/text..." rel="nofollow">http://conjur.estadao.com.br/static/text...</a><br>  <br>  Outro esfor?ado negociador tucano tem sido o jornalista Reinaldo Azevedo, da revista "Primeira Leitura", cuja meta particular tem sido qualificar-se como porta-voz da direita brasileira. Ainda que intelectualmente limitado e dono de texto raso e confuso, Azevedo tem sido reverenciado pelos reacionários brasileiros, a ponto de merecer referência no site Mídia Sem Máscara, do filósofo "neonazista" Olavo de Carvalho. No mundo das transa??es subterraneas, Azevedo é conhecido pela avareza. Espírito disciplinado de militante, procura pagar pouco por textos de interesse da cúpula tucana.<br>  <br>  A ala dos alquimistas teve em Roger Ferreira seu mais destacado negociador. O ex-assessor de comunica??o do governador de S?o Paulo, Geraldo Alckmin, atuou às claras nas grandes reda??es, a ponto de ser chamado de "trintinha", numa alus?o ao pre?o padr?o pago por matérias especiais do interesse de seu chefe.<br>  <br>  Roger Ferreira, citado no dossiê elaborado pelo ex-gerente de marketing do banco Nossa Caixa Jaime de Castro Júnior, coordenava o esquema do Palácio dos Bandeirantes para beneficiar com verbas de publicidade uma série de emissoras de rádio e TV, além de jornais e revistas. Ferreira foi ainda interlocutor do governo paulista em tratativas com representantes do grupo Cisneros (Venezuela) no Brasil. A corpora??o mantém uma parceria comercial com o Grupo Abril, que publica Veja.<br>  <br>  De acordo com o deputado estadual Afanásio Jazadji, do PFL, o governador Alckmin chegou a negociar pessoalmente projetos inescrupulosos para dourar sua imagem pública.<br>  <br>  Pelado na Marginal<br>  <br>  Por fim, a ala alquimista conta também com o apoio do professor Carlos Alberto Di Franco, membro ativo da seita católica direitista Opus Dei. Di Franco, destacado para ministrar aulas ao candidato do PSDB à presidência da República, é conhecido por aliciar jovens profissionais de imprensa para a causa do grupo, conduzindo-os à Universidade de Navarra, na Espanha. Fora do mundo da política, Di Franco é conhecido pelos hábitos excêntricos. Há poucos anos, foi flagrado caminhando nu pela Marginal do Rio Pinheiros, uma importante via expressa da Capital de S?o Paulo. Abordado por políciais, o professor alegou que tinha sido assaltado e que os criminosos o haviam obrigado a nadar nas poluídas águas curso fluvial. <br>  <br>  A rea??o da cidadania<br>  <br>  Os fatos est?o devidamente expostos, "mastigadinhos", como dizem os brasileiros. Cabe aos cidad?os de bem, especialmente aos jornalistas que escaparam da sedu??o criminosa, reagir e reinstaurar o paradigma da ética nas rela??es triangulares entre governo, mídia e sociedade.

I'll give you an example - Why is it that all terrorist causing havoc in India are from Pakistan? Or Why is it that all of them have Pakistani arms? One more example Why is it that  many of them have Pakistani passports? or Why do hundreds of terrorists caught every year by the Indian intelligence are funded both in terms of arms and money by the ISI - Pakistans intelligence?<br>  <br>  If Pakistan was doing enough to stop terrorism, then why is POK (Pakistan occupied Kashmir) [Kashmir was originally a part of India] still "blossoming" with  terrorist camps? <br>  <br>  Coming to the US scenario, Recently it was on BBC and CNN that most of Al Quida members are now fleeing into Pakistan. I think Pakistan has enough armed forces to at least stop their border from being breached. <br>  <br>  Millions of dollars in terms of Arms and Weapons are being provided to Pakistan by the Western world. Then does Pakistan not have enough manpower to use them? Or are the weapons being stocked for another war (Four have already been waged) against India? <br>  <br>  The Country besides Pakistan is India. It surprises me that why has the world not supported India? Terrorists funded by Pakistan have killed thousands of innocent lives in India, attacked the Indian Parliament (December), Held Serial blasts in many places (Delhi, Mumbai), Blown up entire train coaches (Mumbai train serial blasts), hijacked aircrafts, attacked sacred Hindu temples(Gujrat, and the temple in Ayodhya) and what not. <br>  <br>  I think I agree with Skippy that we could better provide India with that support as it has already been proving itself. Also India has been much supportive in sharing intelligence reports on terrorism with the rest of the world.|`|8d026a70db675ebfa12440660dacef96aa	Of course they are playing games.

America never helped Pakistan according to its need, Pakistan is giving a very big cost in terms of country stability and security risk to masses, by obeying America as its ally. History proved that America is not a country to be trusted. They are always saying to do some more to sort out terrorism, on the other side America itself is promoting it. Today America is big threat to world as super power. Why not to throw away concept of all super power country form the world to achieve peace and stability.

2c6d4e2895b18c7ca320b93ea5d63921aa	I love that website.  I'm not a conspiracy theorist but I have to say that sometimes you can really find a gem of info there.  Everything Henry Rollins said is true.   And I am am so tired of hearing the same old BS of "if you're not with us, you're a terrorist sympathizer" or "if you disagree with us you're unamerican" BSBSBSBSBS or "well if you have nothing to hide, then why should you care"  BECAUSE IT'S OUR FREEDOMS!!!  The thing that sets us apart....the thing that makes us the greatest country on this earth...it's what makes us who we are.  One of our founding fathers said people who are willing to give up a little freedom for a little security doesn't deserve either. (Ben Franklin)  And it's true.  <br>  <br>  The thing is, let's live in fantasy land for a moment....let's say that this current administration was trustworthy and would never use any of the information it gathered (illegally) against an american citizen unless they were a valid terror suspect, and let's say that they were honorable enough not to take that information they gleen from our phone records and web records to open a file on each and every one of us and let's just say that this administration was honest enought that it wouldn't use that information to silence people who oppose their ajendas....let's just say that is the case...that this administration is noble, trustworthy and above suspicion - truly honorable.  But what about the next administration?  Or the one after that?   And WHO is to decide who is a threat?  And how do you know that their reasons are valid if the person isn't allowed to a fair trial?  And their representation isn't even allowed to see the evidence?  Don't let them fool you - there is NEVER a good time to surrender freedom, read up on other times in our history when our freedoms were suspended and the terriable things that happened.  <br>  <br>  That's what everyone must do....READ - get your info from MANY MANY sources...not just fox news or prison planet.  Read every thing you can get your hands on, national and international.  Only then will you begin to see the big picture.  I read several international papers online, I used to read papers from the arab countries as well....and then one day it occured to me, what if my surfing habits were being monitored?  Or websites I visit trigger monitoring?  How would it look to someone with a hair trigger mentality who wanted to catch a terrorist sympathizer?  And then I wanted to vomit....why?  Because NEVER NEVER NEVER in my very worst nightmare should that thought ever pass thru my mind.  I live in the United States of America!  I shouldn't have to worry about what websites I visit!!!  I know I'm a good citizen, I pay attention to current events, I vote, I get involved in my community - but yet I have these talking heads on TV telling me over and over and over that I'm unAmerican because I don't agree with the president and  I am unwilling to surrender the freedoms that were given to me by God and protected by the blood of generations of soldiers.  Or that I'm a terrorist sympathizer because I believe that as Americans, we have an obligation to take the moral high ground and stay true to our ideals and not become what we revile the most in our enemies.<br>  <br>  If our founding fathers could see what has become of their grand experiment...they would go into convulsions in their graves!|`|6737bc1385aaa269c889b6f7c3e1c1e7aa	Why can't these people just SHUT UP for crying out loud?!?!

0434e1d9107cf4f82f7329c8fbea91beaa	The intent (at least in my home state of Oklahoma) was to force all businesses to adapt to anti-smoker's directives and to a large extent, it has suceeded. <br>  Personally, I actively seek out the restaurants that have smoking rooms (there are a few in my area) and frequent them while patently avoiding any restaurant that does not have smoking areas. I frequently will enter an establishment and if I am unaware of their smoking policy, will ask. If told they have no smoking area, I simply leave, always.<br>  <br>  The reason for the hatefulness is simply buttheads looking down their noses at others. They think they are somehow better because they don't smoke, little realizing the bullS&%$ they've been spoonfed for the past 20 years is manure, yet they swallow it like honey. They accept, too willingly, that which fits their prejudice while at the same time, causing more pollution and carcinogens than many smokers by their actions and habits such as SUVs, fireplaces, charcoal grills, etc.<br>  <br>  One would think that since tobacco smoke is not a major polluter out of doors that just about anywhere outside would be acceptable. Not so. The fact is, these anti-smoking zealots want to punish smokers very much like whites treated blacks in regard to eating and socializing. I am old enough to remember "colored only" and "white only" restrooms and public drinking fountains. Although the overall treatment of blacks cannot be compared to smokers, some parts can. Blacks were not allowed to eat with whites in the dining room but had to eat out back or in another separate room. They were not allowed to sit anywhere they liked but had designated areas.<br>  "Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities." ~Voltaire (1694 - 1778)|`|AA10666278	second hand smoke my ***.

He's just going to tax the wealthy at a slightly higher rate than Bush did.  It will be small change to them, and they won't even miss it.  However, the Republicans will do their best to make Americans feel that they are being overtaxed and presecuted.  That's how Reagan got elected.  He promised tax cuts for everybody - I started getting an extra $8 per month in my paycheck.  But when it was time to file my taxes, I ended up paying a lot more because the Reagan Administration took away a big chunk of my deductions.<br>  <br>  I believe that Obama is going to be a lot more fair about the whole thing.

That's not surprising--those who deserve their wealth don't mind paying their fair share. And don't spread lies like calling 3% the "bulk" of their earnings.<br>  <br>  The ONLY people who are griping are con artists, "exectutives" who  got a deal because they knew someone, and similar trash who aren't actually worth minimum wage.|`|aSjdL4heaa	You clearly don't understand what he is proposing.  He wants to restore the top income tax bracket to what it was under Ronald Regan.  Even the most rabid conservatives don't think Ronald Regan was anti-business.   In fact, his plan extends business tax incentives through 2009 (they were scheduled to expire in 2008).<br>  <br>  First - you must understand that this is 'net' income - not gross income.  Even with a 50% profit margin (which is really outrageous ... profit margins are *much* smaller), the business could generate up to $499,999 and still not have income over $250,000.<br>  <br>   According to Business Week (clearly not a left wing magazine), 75% of small businesses pass-through the income to the owner, making their income subject to this income tax bracket (it is not a business tax).  They also report that 70% of large small businesses (with up to 250 employees) do not earn enough to be in the top bracket.  In fact, only about 8% of small businesses pass-through the money *and* earn more than $250,000 - and a large portion of those are limited-employee businesses like lawyers.<br>  <br>  Finally, the top tax bracket is currently 35%.  The Obama plan lets it rise to about 39%.  I'm not sure how you get "bulk of all earnings" by this 4% increase.<br>  <br>  Stop listening to alarmist pundits and do the research and you'll find that you are getting excited over nothing.|`|KT0oKTZdaa	well the wealthy already get charged 35% federal income tax.So really at the most i could see them raising it to 40%. which add up, but i dont think it would make people stop starting businesses.  <a href="http://www.moneychimp.com/features/tax_brackets.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.moneychimp.com/features/tax_b...</a> this is the taxes right now, non corporate just basic income tax percent ranges.

I don't agree that we "have too many people in America."  There is still plenty of wide open spaces, plenty of opportunity, and plenty of room for more individuals to LEGALLY come to this country and have the opportunity to make the best of themselves.  Allowing people to illegally enter this country & then give them amnesty (don't tell me that a "guest worker program" isn't amnesty), only encourages more illegal migration.  Our country is big enough, and our economy is strong enough, to support many more people and still be the U.S. of A!  What we have is too many legislators who don't have the courage to take action to enforce existing immigration laws, and are more concerned about getting re-elected than about addressing issues that concern and impact every-day Americans.|`|Na3Osphsaa	Sure we should.<br>  <br>   Think about it , we guard borders all over the world<br>  <br>   our men n woman in the service are told they have to<br>  <br>   we keep people out of other country's that do not want<br>  <br>   certain people coming in their country .

t3QAaSN9aa	As the article points out, the rule was instituted in the last days of the Bush administration.  Apparently throughout almost all of the Bush administration, this rule was not needed, which shows how important it was to the Bush administration.<br>  <br>  Also, for your enlightenment, it is "whether" not "weather."|`|hiCSVwchaa	Doctors and nurses are already protected under a separate law from being forced to perform abortions.<br>  <br>  <br>  "Federal protection of provider-conscience rights dates back to the 1970s when Congress enacted the Church Amendments.  The Amendments protect health care providers and other individuals from discrimination by recipients of HHS funds on the basis of their refusal -- due to religious belief or moral conviction -- to perform or participate in any lawful health service or research activity."|`|v1zyfea5aa	The abysmal ignorance of the lefties is appalling.  First, as to the Hippocratic Oath.  Most demand that all human life is sacred. Many forbade abortion altogether, since the baby is human at least in some form and ALL human life is to be preserved.  Second, obama's plan is to force medical professionals to perform whatever the government says regardless of their own moral conscience.  This is exactly why the Hippocratic Oath came into being was to prevent doctors from murdering for the state leaders through poisoning etc.  So, for all the ignorant, hate filled, uneducated and worthless "I am so selfish I will even kill my baby" crowd.  Do not worry about any of this.  We as physicians and surgeons have been pushed to the brink and between this new rule and obama's enforcement of slave labor thru his taxation, most of us are going to slow down or stop altogether unless you are family, friends or conservative.

But I think it needs to be defined a bit better.  I don't think doctors or nurses should be forced to perform abortions if it's against their moral beliefs.

This would require removal of all religion, or all religions except for a single sect of a single religion.  It would mean that everyone would have to work under a single economic structure.  Cultural morals and values would have to become very similar, or entirely the same.  None of these are feasible in our current situation, and I don't see them happening any time in the near future.  I wouldn't be against it happening, but only if those conditions are met.<br>  <br>  Remember, even individual countries don't even run under a single government.  The US, for example, has 50 states with their own government, and each of those states have many local government systems.

I had all my medical bills paid and about 80% of my lost wages.  I got nothing for pain and suffering.  I was reimbursed for gas costs to the Doctors and for daycare cost while at the Doctors.  Now in my case the other drivers were at fault and clearly in the wrong.  I have heard of one girl who got 100,000$ for a scare on her face but I don't know how big the scare was.  If this scare is noticeable and bothers your daughter hire a lawyer.   Remember the lawyer will take 30% of what you  collect. If she can live with the scare let it go.  Make sure they pay her Hospital bills.<br>  <br>   Aside from that  If your daughter didn't have any lost wages you won't get much.  I would think they will offer around 1,000 if there is no loss of wages.<br>  <br>      I would like to address the people who think sewing insurance companies is wrong.   I will NEVER be the same after my two crashes.  I have had years of pain.  Why?  Because people have to drive like jerks.  Nothing ever happens to these bad drivers and that isn't fair.  Our only choice is to sew so shut up please.  Until you get hammered by a bad driver you have no right to speak.<br>  <br>     I agree with sgoldper.

You think it was a freak accident that couldn't have been prevented right? So then you should ask for the Hospital Bills to be covered. I realize your daughter had problems getting in a car at first afterward, but she's fine now so no real need to talk about pain and suffering. Perhaps you want a little extra over the hospital bills, fine. To me though we'd have to know the bills that YOU paid to say what settlement you should ask for.

AA10515896	There are many different ways to classify and organize govts.<br>  One of the simplest is how power is distributed. <br>  <br>  Democracy is where the people vote to make decisions. In a pure (polyarchal) democracy, everyone votes on every issue directly. In a representative republic, we elect people to make the decisions for us.<br>  <br>  Monarchy is rule by a crown -- one central individual. A parliamentary monarch has most of the day-to-day power delegated to ministers, who may be elected by the people or appointed. A delegatory republic has representatives of the people appointed by the crown, but otherwise functions as a democratic republic.<br>  <br>  Fascism is a concentration of power into a rigid hierarchy, where personal liberties are restricted. Fascism can result from a representative republic, or a monarchy, or any other way where someone can seize and hold power. By dictionary definition, any fascist govt must be right-wing conservative, since the rigid restrictive hierarchy is directly opposed to the liberal egalitarian model of civil liberties.<br>  <br>  Other hybrid forms exist -- rule (or voting) by an elite noble class, or based on wealth or property ownership, etc.<br>  <br>  The other way to organize governments is by the economic models they follow.<br>  <br>  Capitalism requires individual ownership of property. <br>  Socialism promotes govt control (ownership or regulation) of major industry, whereas communism dictates community (govt) ownership of all resources and significant property.<br>  <br>  Any of those three can exist in any political model. So, its just as easy to have a fascist capitalist government as a it is to have a democratic communist government. <br>  <br>  Most recently, the common combinations have been fascist-socialist (Soviet Union, China), monarchy-socialist (England). The USA is a democratic republic with a hybrid capitalist-socialist model.<br>  <br>  "What each one stands for" is not answerable. Political and economic models don't stand for anything, outside the requirements of their structure.|`|UlES4eJPaa	Two types of government: religious and non religious.

Bring in copies of your grades if they are good, volunteer in charity organization now before the court date and have them provide a referance, get character reference letters from teachers, employers, community leaders.

Next time don't drive alone until you have your license, which will probably be quite a bit longer now.  Who do you mean by "they took my vehicle"? If they police impounded the vehicle, find out where they stored your vehicle and get it out as soon as possible, the charges accrue daily. Once you find out where the vehicle is being stored contact them and find out exactly what they require for you to pick it up.

That will, at least, reduce your fine, and the court might find favor to charge you with a secondary charge less severe than what you received. Also, you will most likely get the vehicle back. You'll have to bring a parent or licensed driver, and most likely will have to pay lot fees for getting the vehicle towed.

AUsvrW8faa	I'm amazed at the republicans that responded to this and still won't admit what most of their party is saying or thinking.  They're still defending it. As far as the taxes increasing for those over 250k- I think it's time.  It's either those over 250k or under 250k.  Personally, I think those of us under 250k have foot the bill long enough(for the last 8 years).  I need a break!<br>  <br>  Ps.. I work full time EVERYDAY and I am considered poor(52k) I'm a single mother and I owe the IRS.  Can't afford to lower the exemptions- if I do, I won't make the bills. No one to help and I don't qualify for any assistance. It's either owe the gov or get put on the street.|`|m1T2fSnHaa	I never once heard a conservative say they were lazy, why would they?  Most conservative make less than 250k anyhow.   They did a study, democrats on average make more income than republicans.         Do you really think that the 5% Of our population that makes over 250k wanted socialism or just plain old democratic views.   Obama is far far left of a democrat- sharing the wealth is not democrat.  Clinton took away the welfare program, he had higher taxes on the rich but when Bush changed that lowering their taxes we had millions more jobs..|`|G49lKR56aa	well, this is news to me!<br>  <br>  Come on people, let me know this kind of stuff!

More jobs in the economy provides more opportunity for everyone -- especially for those who earn less than $250K/year.  <br>  <br>  So the question is, why do we punish those who are creating the jobs in an effort to shuffle money to the "poorer" population rather than reinforcing business and giving people a sense of individual-responsibility by providing more jobs and subsequently providing for the ability to care for themselves (w/o government "intervention")?

GYZgfkP5aa	You could get the matter back before a judge and the court would require him to pay the obligation ordered of him.  The problem you will face in doing that is that will likely alienate your now-friendly ex and could put a big damper on his willingness to help you out.  If you haven't brought it up to him, you might try that & let him know that there is a court order requiring him to pay, that he agreed to so he wouldn't have to pay you alimony, that he has reneged on his representation to the court, and because of that you are having to pay those bills.  Maybe he'd make an effort to pitch in financially???|`|baa8b39be524b01b8b41aaa44d43388eaa	This was something that was put on paper from court.. It is court ordered that he pay u alimony..

ON5BbJ04aa	You've already gotten some pretty good answers, but, I decided to  add my two cents worth, anyway.<br>  <br>  The Magna Carta was the  “great charter” of English liberties, forced from King John by the English barons and sealed at Runnymede, June 15, 1215.  <br>  <br>  It was a list of rights and privileges. It established the principles that the king could not levy taxes without consent of his legislature, or parliament, and that no free man in England could be deprived of liberty or property except through a trial or other legal process,  <br>  <br>  It is also defined in the American Heritage Dictionary as a document or piece of legislation that serves as a guarantee of basic rights. Little wonder, as it influenced the development of several modern legal and constitutional principles (as in "due process of law").|`|GYZgfkP5aa	The Magna Carta is an English charter originally issued in 1215. It was the most significant early influence on the extensive historical process that led to the rule of constitutional law today. The Magna Carta influenced many common law and other documents, such as the United States Constitution and Bill of Rights, and is considered one of the most important legal documents in the history of democracy.<br>  <br>  The Magna Carta was originally written because of disagreements between Pope Innocent III, King John and his English barons about the rights of the King.It required the king to renounce certain rights, respect certain legal procedures and accept that the will of the king could be bound by the law. It explicitly protected certain rights of the King's subjects - whether free and unfree - most notably the right of Habeas Corpus. Many clauses were renewed throughout the Middle Ages, and further during the Tudor and Stuart periods, and the 17th and 18th centuries. By the early 19th century most clauses in their original form had been repealed from English law.<br>  <br>  There are a number of popular misconceptions about Magna Carta, such as that it was the first document to limit the power of an English king by law (it was not the first, and was partly based on the Charter of Liberties); that it in practice limited the power of the king (it mostly did not in the Middle Ages); and that it is a single static document (it is a variety of documents referred to under a common name).|`|f4f56f95a22a3b94e8ca0ade60acd7ffaa	it is <br>  Document signed by King John of England in 1215 AD that limited the king’s power and guaranteed certain basic rights.

56db1a8e5fe3dfc4d4fbbbff987d0191aa	It is has started.  When people feel they are overtaxed and burdened by the government, yes they will rise up.  Can you imagine being taxed on your inheritance?  Going to school for 8 years or more to be a doctor and having all your money go to the government.  If Obama lets the current tax cuts expire, it will place a $2.4 Trillion dollar burden on American families and seniors.  There will be 17 million seniors hit with an average $2,000 tax increase if they expire.  There were over 8 million jobs created after the tax cuts of 2003!  <br>  Just where is Obama and Pelosi taking us?  Apparently in the wrong direction.  The more people that are waking up to this are also getting fed up with what is coming out of Washington.  Wars have been started over tax issues.|`|2KORqD1Oaa	We don't know that Obama's policies are bad yet.  Some people are saying that they are because they want him to fail - it will make them look good even though they have no intention of working on ways to solve the problems with any other methods.<br>  <br>  If the recovery programs do not begin to produce results by the end of Obama's first term, then the people can vote him out of office.  However, we have no choice at the moment but to try his policies - the Republican  policies were obvious failures, even though they are ranting against the recovery plan.  And as long as the Republican Party does not come up with any reasonable solutions, the people will remain loyal to Obama.|`|HP53PqRCaa	If Obama "goes away" then Biden gets the office.

AA11089016	I'd totally support the idea. My ideology is moderate libertarian and have been flirting with the Libertarian Party. There are some things I disagree with but on the rest I favor it. However, I think Libertarians should be able to reach out to the moderate/ independent group and present their issues in a more moderate way. Then when the LP gets bigger and does win elections (starting with smaller but important ones), you can be able to broaden the party with moderate Libertarians and radical Libertarians (I also forgot ideological libertarians). It's cool to follow a party's platform but there should also be a chance to pursuit the platform in a more moderate approach. For example, why do you think the Socialists were successful in the 1920s? They got between 3% and 6% in Presidential elections and got some Representatives in the U.S. House for a long time (1 member was from Wisconsin I remember). What killed them was the fact that there was more than 1 Socialist-leaning party and they became minor parties. In 2006, the Libertarians reformed their platform and now they seem to be more viable to do well, but they need to unite, reformers and radicals, for the sake of the party. For the time now, I've been supporting a ticket with Paul and Tancredo for Pres. as a third party unity ticket (Libertarian and Constitution parties) because of the illegal immigration problem but I also saw Kubby and Phillies taking a strong stance on illegals.

AA12200754	A trial court or court of first instance is the court in which most civil or criminal cases begin. Not all cases are heard in trial courts; some cases may begin in inferior limited jurisdiction bodies such as the case of the jurisdiction of an administrative body that has been created by statute to make some kind of binding determination under the law and were simplified procedural practices may apply similar to arbitration.<br>  <br>  In the trial court evidence is taken and determinations are made called findings of fact based on the evidence under the rules of evidence of the court following the applicable procedural law; the court also makes findings of law based upon the applicable law. Findings of fact are determined by the trier of fact (judge or jury) and the findings of law are always determined by the judge or judges. In most common law jurisdictions, the trial court often sits with a jury and one judge; though some cases may be designated "bench trials" — either by statute, custom, or by agreement of the parties — in which the judge makes both fact and law determinations.<br>  <br>  A trial court is distinguished from an appellate court, which reviews cases that have already been heard in the trial court. In appellate review the record of the trial court must be certified by the clerk of the trial court and transmitted to the appellate body. Most appellate courts do not have the authority to hear testimony or take evidence, but must rely upon the record below. Most trial courts are courts of record. The trial court is the court where the record of the presentation of evidence is created and must be maintained or transmitted to the appellate court.<br>  <br>  In the United States, the United States district court is the sole trial court of general jurisdiction in the federal judicial system. State court systems refer to their trial courts by a variety of names, including "district court", "circuit court", "superior court", and (in New York) "Supreme court".<br>  <br>  The Appellate Courts hear and determine appeals from the decisions of the Trial Courts. The Appellate Courts are the Court of Appeals (the highest Court in the State), the Appellate Divisions of the Supreme Court, the Appellate Terms of the Supreme Court, and the County Courts acting as Appellate Courts in the Third and Fourth Judicial Departments.<br>  <br>  atp|`|fw8YIzj9aa	The trial court has original jurisdiction and an appellate court only has appellate jurisdiction.|`|GYZgfkP5aa	A trial court is where a trial takes place, either by jury or by judge.  This is where the facts are determined, the judge applies the law to the facts and the decision on the case is made.  An appellate court reviews the trial court's decisions & usually will only review the application of law, deferring to the trial judge or jury to determine the facts.  There are usually two levels of appellate court - a Court of Appeals and a Supreme Court.  Some states title these differently.  Usually one has a right to an appeal at the Court of Appeals & the Supreme Court has discretion to accept a case.

If you are in a lawsuit now, you can either: 1) use discovery to the agency that you are in a suit with (a Request for Production of Documents); or 2) use a subpoena to obtain documents from other agencies that are not a part of the lawsuit. (a "third-party").<br>  <br>  If you are not in a lawsuit now, you can use the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to get documents from federal agencies, and many states have a specific act in the state that is similar to the FOIA, but is often called by a different name - such as Inspection of Public Records Act (in New Mexico for example).  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|6d335ff07bb08c2ac3eb44809f2e88a7aa	Have you asked the authorities for a copy of the document?<br>  If they do not cooperate, and you have a case pending in a court, subpoena the document from them.|`|dfe945563b9ae826cfae830b6fe16121aa	you may need to get a subpoena to get a copy, but it is do able, if you need if for evidence in a case.|`|15b5fd0d09e8dbb6700f9655e96fde13aa	As soon as you are charged, your attorney has the ability to file a pretrial Motion for Discovery that requires the State to provide you (your attorney) with all evidence that the State has and plans to use against you as well as the names of each person they intend to call as witnesses against you.

GYZgfkP5aa	Yes, you should hire an attorney.  Unfortunately for you, your ex will cost you more money.  However, I would venture to guess that he will lose.  Too much time has passed.  If the house was part of the divorce & included in the division of assets, he has waited way too long to (in essence) reopen the final decree.  Also, if he signed a quitclaim, he signed away his interests in the house.  A good lawyer should make short work of your ex.  Demand that your lawyer include a counter-claim against your ex for "abuse of process."|`|SKhkrQh7aa	With the complexities of this, you better get an attorney who can guide you through this 17-year old mess.

GYZgfkP5aa	False.  Scope of employment is just that - and includes everyone who is working, for themselves, for someone else, etc., performing the duties of one's job.  This doctrine is usually invoked for the purpose of "respondeat superior", when one is doing something in furtherance of duties owed to the employer, and where the employer is exercising some control over the employee's activities.  <br>  <br>  Acting under color of law pertains to a state actor/employee, with the appearance or semblance, but without the substance, of legal right.  Misuse of power, possessed by virtue of state law and made possible only because the wrongdoer is cloethed with the authority of the state, is action taken under "color of law".|`|SKhkrQh7aa	Not necessarily.  Acting in the scope of employment means that you are doing those things which fall under your job description and that you normally, customarily do.  If you do something negligent while employed for someone else, they may try to nail your employer for your negligence by alleging that you were acting within the scope of your employment and were therefore an agent of your employer.  Under the color of law means that you are operating under the law.  While acting in the course and scope of your employment can also be considered to be acting under the color of law (especially if you are negligent and acting on behalf of your employer), they are separate legal concepts.

I would have done the same thing.<br>  <br>  As a matter of fact, I had a similar incident happen to me early in my career.  I was just out on my own and anxious to make a difference my first week out.  I was on patrol on midnights.  I was driving through a neighborhood known for burglaries.  I noticed someone trying to break into a house.  I blacked out my car and called in the address.  Another officer and SGT. were dispatched to my location.  My backup was only a few blocks away.  I exited my vehicle and waited until my backup arrived.  Eventually we found the individual in the back yard of the residence.  He had fallen asleep on the mass transit bus and was dropped off in a neighboring town.  He walked to this house (which turned out to be his mother's) to see if she would help.  We ran the address and found the owner.  We contacted her at her work (E.R. at a local hospital) and asked her to identify her son.  She said she was not having good relations with her son at the time (which exlplains why he did not have any house keys), but was willing to let him stay there until she got off of work.<br>  <br>  We gave him back his knife, which we found in an officer safety search, and left the area.  SGT. said we (both of us officers were farely new) did a good job handling the situation, by not jumping to conclusions.<br>  <br>  Long story short, I think you did a fine job.  Good luck with your career.|`|a2bf1368a29886bcc5c679b550d1ba1baa	15 years on the job here. sounds like you followed a reasonable course of action. back up is always a good idea until you know for sure whats what. as far as handcuffing the woman, if she was acting in the manner you described then i don't think it would be necessary. one thing to remember when you get on the street is that things are not always what they appear to be. as a beat officer you don't always have alot of time to investigate as thoroughly as you want but you do need to make sure what the true situation is if possible. in the end you are responsible for making a judgment call/decision. if you know your stuff and you act in good faith you normally won't go wrong. good luck|`|kOEtJ31eaa	It sounds good to me, but I had more relaxed interactions with the public. Some old schoolers may criticize you for not having sufficient control of the suspect, but the rules for policing have changed.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you verified all the information that you needed to. It is a strange situation, but I am sure you will run into even stranger occurences than that once you get on patrol.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|oKwqzi4Baa	Unless there was a reason to suspect that your safety was in danger, there is no reason to handcuff someone in that case. Although officer safety is the number one rule in law enforcement, there are times when being overcautious could land you in a lawsuit. You did the right thing by checking them both out, but not going hands-on with them, since there was no reason to feel threatened (from your description).

GYZgfkP5aa	A quitclaim deed only gives you whatever rights the assignor had.  A warranty deed is a promise that the assignor will defend title against another's claim (sort of a guarantee).  You can't convert a quitclaim to a warranty deed.  You could record a warranty deed if the seller gives you one.  You can build whatever you want to on the property now, but you should know that if someone else comes along and claims superior title, you might lose your house!  Also, if you sell the land by giving a warranty deed, you are assuming all of the risks in guaranteeing title to the new purchaser.  That would be a very bad move if you haven't obtained a title search.<br>  <br>  Your quitclaim may be all the title you need, if there was no question that the person you got that deed from had fee simple title.  However, before you proceed to build or sell, you would be wise to go to a local title company and have them do a title search for you.  That will either let you know if there are any problems in the title, or give you piece of mind that you have clear title to the property.|`|93fc57ca1c692acd2bd8f1bc7a446e6eaa	The other two respondents are correct.  You should do a thorough title search before pursuing this any further.  A quit claim only conveys whatever interest the conveyor might or might not have.  You cannot convert it to a grant or warranty deed without making sure your claim to the title is complete.  If it turns out that the grantor of the quit claim deed was in fact the rightful owner of the property, then you are alright to move forward.  However, you might also find out that there are other interest holders in the property and you will have to deal with them before you can do anything with the property.  I would never try to transfer property with a quit claim deed except from myself to myself as trustee of my trust.  I might also transfer to a family member from me to a spouse or child knowing that my title is good before making the transfer, but I would never accept a transfer from a stranger without a thorough title search.  Then, if something bad shows up, you can blaim the title company for not finding the problem.|`|6d335ff07bb08c2ac3eb44809f2e88a7aa	Check with a lawyer in California.  In most states quitclaim deeds do not warrant anything.  They are merely a conveyance of whatever interest, IF ANY, the grantor may have in the property.  I could quitclaim you Rockefeller Center and it would be worthless.|`|uxghBGhQaa	A quit claim deed does not specify who owns the property. A quit claim given by someone just says 'if I had any rights to the property, I give them up'.<br>  It does not convey or transfer ownerhsip in a way that protects the new owner.<br>  I would hire a realestate attorney before building a porta-potty on that land.

4f3cjyw7aa	You can write "paid in full" in there to pay off a debt for less than you owe.  For instance, if I owe you $100 for a tv and then send you a check for $75 marked "paid in full," which you later cash, then you have agreed to allow me to pay $75 for the $100 I owe you.  Now, the "paid in full" must be put on the check in good faith.  This most often comes up in situations where you didn't get what you paid for, so you reduced the amount you are going to pay accordingly.  This has been well settled in the common law of the US.<br>  <br>  You can also write "paid under protest" to reserve your rights.  For example, if that tv in the example above was broken, but you were demanding payment or else send me to the creditors, then I could mark "paid under protest" on the check to reserve any rights I have against you.  This most often comes up where the payment is simply to avoid additional trouble (such as late fees or creditors), but you still want to keep your rights to pursue the charge in the first place.  This too has been well settled in the common law of the US.<br>  <br>  Those are the only two terms with legal significance I can think of, but many people just use the memo line for their own personal record keeping.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	The memo line is for your own notes, not a rule that the check is made for.

XtQbPiD1aa	There are no logical legal or ethical arguments to support segregation.  I am sure they used rationalization similar to what they do in India with their caste system.  If you can make yourself think that a person is somehow not human on the same level that you are then you can try to justify treating them differently.  The segregationists did not feel that African Americans were humans on the same level they were.  Throughout time there has always been justification (not logical) for one person to think they are better than another because of birthright, race, religion, wealth or education.

If not, then you can take the marriage certificate as proof of the marriage and tell the judge you can not find a county in which a divorce was filed. <br>  Good Luck!|`|B8qVxYu7aa	what about the 3 wife. you can get her marriage paper and show hes a biggaboy and get your marrage paper cauz it shoould say what he is when hes gets married like if hez single or divoreced and sttff like that

The parameters for "good" in India are unfortunately different. Here, good means good u are at corruption, how good u are fooling people, in short, how good you are doing nothing !|`|AA10298137	The presidency of India is a fairly powerless position (something like the queen of England, mostly symbolic).  So I don't think who the president is really makes any difference.  The prime minister is the most important, and India already had its first female PM a long time ago.|`|7fXjkTbXaa	It is so disgusting to find that we have all fallen so low as to classify human beings as SC,ST,OBC,Hindu, Muslim, Woman and so on and so forth.

oDzCspRCaa	Yes they will. Don't know why people think the manufacture will just eat the loss. Someone will get fired or you will be paying more|`|AA10065077	There is always something hidden. If Obama taxes the manufacture prices may rise, they may cut employees , cut dividends,cut employee benefits  or worse move to a different country. Either way companies aren't just going to eat the cost.I don't like NAFTA and that's something Obama and people need to remember|`|BRwPEuzAaa	The consumers will be taxed up the sphinxter for the next four generations and counting...<br>  <br>  Inflation, as a matter of fact is in essence a tax without legislative approval. On top of this, sit tight and expect taxes for the radios in your house, the tv sets, the telephones, etc. Ask the Brits about taxes.|`|j4KK74Paaa	That & lay middle class employees OFF!!!!<br>  McCain already answered that for you LISTEN!!!!|`|krAlopvsaa	Possible, or they will employ less, produce less, give a lower dividend, etc.<br>  It will not disapeer.|`|RgO3Sn38aa	Of course.  That's what people don't understand.  They are going to pay one way or another with Obama's plan.  95% of the people may not get their payroll taxes increased, but wait till they get to the stores and malls and the goods they want are not there because companies were forced out of business, or the prices are so high they can't afford the items they want.   It's common sense. Do the math.

It's not Obama's fault Chicago is so messed up.  I don't understand the comparison of the murder rates... the federal government actually causes people to die in Iraq by continuing this pointless war, while the IL state government tries to stop murder in Chicago.  Also, if you research which states have the highest murder rates, you will find that almost all of the top 10, if not all of them, are red states.  |`|AA10065077	Hello people. He says that he's going to fix Washington but these numbers speak for themselves. Also other than the odvious ( political, educational) can someone name one achievment Obama has done? Remember the people he did hang around with?|`|fShlKEfYaa	What he knows will follow him to roost where he goes.<br>  * And there were a few unsolved murders recently of gay men who attended Rev Wright's Trinity church. <br>  * Education - one of the worst rates of attending college after high school<br>  * Water pollution - non-disinfected sewage is discharged directly into the Chicago River in violation of the Clean Water Act, which Chicago believes does not apply to man-made rivers.<br>  * Coal plant polluting mercury into streams and Great Lakes, which after Obama left the state Senate, Illinois passed a law with the goal to clean-up the majority of the coal-plant mercury by 2015.
eeWwIOBAaa	Your joking right? Ok that's the problem with Democrats, ya'll think that everyone should be taking care of everyone. My problem with that is I strongly believe that I should be able to keep my hard earned money for myself and my family b/c that's who I'm working for. For my family to have food and clothes and running water. Not that I don't care about anyone else in this country, but not everyone can be on welfare. If you want a hand out you need to work for it. Paying more taxes and sharing the your wealth has nothing to do with patriotism. |`|AA10065077	It might be patriotic to pay more taxes, but we are taxed enough. It is pathetic to have to work two full time jobs just to have enough money to be broke. It has nothing to do with being unpatriotic. If the U.S. government had a good reason to raise taxes then fine, but the reasons they have so far not good enough. If I have to pay more in taxes then my Senator has to stop having $500 a day lunches. People also don't have a problem with helping others, but I'm not willing to work so others can sit on their butt. People share wealth by giving to charities. By redistributing wealth in America makes hard working people work harder and for those on welfare no initiative to get a job.|`|coBISjDfaa	Yeah, Obama wants to put tax rates at around what they were when Reagan was president. I guess all these conservatives are calling Reagan a socialist too. <br>  <br>  <br>  You people do realize this guy is being sarcastic....don't you? Oh wait, you're republicans, nevermind.|`|uxu8qJUYaa	Without their complaints, they are nothing but mindless zombies, they are empty.  And Bob Hope would say, "you mean like Democrats"|`|ERGGLvYiaa	Because we are a free society and not a communist dictatorship...well, unless you are voted in Joe, then I expect the freedom to vanish,.|`|C3gaC24Iaa	It removes the incentives in a society to succeed, or work hard.<br>  "To get ahead" would no longer be something anyone would bother to do.<br>  This business and entrepreneurial malaise would cause industry to grind to a pathetic halt, as businesses that are big enough, relocate to other countries, collapse, or are "rescued" by the state, as it takes over the control of the company or business.<br>  This is Socialism .<br>  This leads to economic collapse, and a welfare state, similar to any South American banana republic, or we can look to the greatest example of state control of everything, the old Soviet Union.<br>  It didn't work out too well for them, did it?|`|qRlPRJ1Jaa	Well joe, you can redistribute wealth in Russia or Cuba or another commie country, but here in America we would like to remain a super power and wealthy country. You and bozo will make us a third world country.|`|72OuVcA8aa	Not the American way Joe, sorry.  If I want to give away my hard earned money I can do so through charity.  The government doesn't distribute my money, I do...|`|99o9d6S4aa	They shouldn't complain....they want us to support unjust wars at 10 billion per month....they should OVERWHELMINGLY be in favor of PAYING for that war AND for paying for our Veterans upon return.

It failed.|`|99dde179de70f1317248d9ffaaf554b0aa	nope |`|mzTJvgTJaa	I never hated on Obama and I certainly never understood why Hillary supporters said they would vote for McCain.

This is because I read the book "The Case Against Barack Obama", by David Freddoso. This book has 35 pages documenting the facts. The fact is Obama is not a man who backs change. His rise to power borders on corruption. I hate it. I voted for Mrs. Clinton for a reason. I am an informed voter. I cannot back this man.|`|03vdbxmeaa	I was never "hatin" on Sen. Obama as a supporter of Sen. Clinton, but because I live in a foreign country (as a US citizen), foreign policy is my most important issue and I can't shake the fact that Sen.

Palin.|`|AA10065077	Actually, I'm still for Hillary and I am planning on writing her name on the ballot.

Bill is by far a republician and for McCain. The people hosting the view are more for Obama. Bill is very outspoken and can handle his own. If things go to bad he'll have a segment on his show telling all about it and later on every hostess on the view will be a pinhead.|`|hvNqywbBaa	I am soooooooooooo glad he is appearing.<br>  He needs to shut that big mouth Joy up.<br>  Too bad Whoopie isn't on so he can take charge with her over bearing authority.<br>  <br>  <br>  Here we have Elisabeth sitting with 4 blabbering bassoons.......<br>  <br>  I see how this show is called the View, because it is solely the view of these 4 blabbering baboons.<br>  <br>  They need to get rid of Joy and her BIG mouth.<br>  She just needs to quit her yapping.<br>  <br>  And today you should see how  pathetic, juvenille and stupid she really is.............WHY?<br>  Because Bill O'Rielly is the guest and is putting her and the other idiots in their place.<br>  <br>  They are kool-aide drinkers for sure!|`|AA11511852	I know he can hold his own but on the show tonight he asked for all to pray for him.<br>  So yes we should.|`|1a0974908cbc1f9184c606facda069d4aa	Yes, but Hasslebeck is there to help buffer the lefty twits.

Don't think about who Murdoch hates, think about what he LOVES.  And THAT, my friend, is MONEY.  He has made gazillions playing both sides with his conservative news channel and liberal entertainment channel.  The Republicans merely give Murdoch the legislation to keep making more and more money.  He's going to be in bed with whoever benefits him most.  I bet if the Democrats created legislation that would allow Murdoch to sell his own mother, you'd see Fox News turn liberal overnight with your friend Michael Moore as anchor.
6hPMnEyWaa	yes. sooner or later it will have to happen. probably not in the near future but I see it happening. probably be another world war before it happens|`|RgO3Sn38aa	God says it, I believe it, that settles it. <br>  The WHEN (in my guessing estimation)  is probably within the next 20 years.  More things have to happen before the Antichrist takes power like a few false flags and a Middle East war with Nations coming against Israel, then a peace treaty, then a Temple built.  When the Antichrist stands in the rebuilt temple claiming to be god, all hell will break loose.  It's all in Daniel, Ezekiel, Matthew, Luke and Revelation.<br>  .  <br>  I wish more people would pay attention to the prophecies in Scripture because the whole thing is all laid out and will happen sooner or later.  Better to be aware and be prepared for what is to come than not.  |`|9cpKYneZaa	Its a failure in the making.

Of course thinking in negativity also contributes to the impossibility of a one world nation but its hard to think positively towards that idea when the present world we live in makes that possibility seem so far fetched unattainable. It would probably take a serious, mind blowing, epic, global event that would require all humans to come together and forget our differences to make us consider globally uniting.|`|EQQFisd8aa	Interesting. <br>  we already have one world.But I honestly think that,one nation can not happen.<br>  <br>  If small nations are already in conflict about power sharing, then just image how many life aspiring presidents we have today.

That a country's wealth depends on enabling even the smallest and most apparently useless loser into someone who can discover the joys of hard work and self-improvement.  <br>  <br>  This requires opportunities.  <br>  <br>  It requires tweaking the market so that the maximum number of people can have a bite of the cherry instead of just a handful grabbing the whole basket and expecting the rest of us to make do on the pips they spit out, or the spit that trickles down.<br>  <br>  And it requires an attitude among everyone that one's responsibility does not start and end with looking after Number One, but means working as hard if not harder for the wider environment, so that systematically it becomes a little easier to live and enjoy life again.|`|ea925d72f7ca4e2163ae1ca793862d3faa	Doesn't it come to a point that your country takes advantage of you?

qdZuien9aa	Many Democrats today believe it's the government's job to be a nanny to society, so I would have to say yes.  That's why they have a strong historical trend for supporting tax increases. It's never enough.<br>  <br>  For whatever reason that lies beyond my understanding, most Democrats have a desire to inject as much government into our personal lives as possible and make society as dependent on government as possible.<br>  <br>  **edit**<br>  <br>  I wonder how, in this case, comparing Disney World to government makes any sense. Apples and oranges anyone?|`|trrd1TVnaa	It depends on what the minimum exemption was and how it was scaled for inflation. And also on whether there are other sources of tax revenue besides income tax. But I believe the answer is yes, as long as the resulting government programs in health, education, infrastructure, and energy were targeted towards lower income households. <br>  <br>  To give a concrete example, both Iceland and the Czech Republic have flat taxes but they also have universal healthcare and basically free university education. |`|AA11524578	Yep.<br>  <br>  And find every way they could to repeal the flat income tax.  |`|AA10065077	Of course they would|`|rdSuD3qVaa	I don't know how it would play in peace time.

Wade and others are conservative and would attempt to over turn it. If a liberal judge retires and McCain got to decide who he wanted to be the new supreme court justice, he would probably chose one that had similar conservative values. Now even with that said, once McCain choses this judge, the congress has to approve of them and I don't think that would be easy with the very likely democratic congress we will end up with. <br>  <br>  Hope that explains it well enough. <br>  <br>  |`|398cff3a3911e99788e6c043af2093abaa	They might over eight years, but it's very unlikely.

They are irresponsible and 50 million babies have paid for it.<br>  God hates this murder, and we are going to answer for it as a nation. People don't want to think that God judges.

Who is going to pay for their blood? I'm afraid we all are, not just the doctors and the babies moms/dads. So actually, we ought to fear the God of the Universe and listen to the commandment that says, "Thou shalt not kill." People don't like to think that they were a person the moment they were conceived, but the Bible says He knew us from that moment, which if you take it for what it says, we were able to be known, not just a blob of tissue like Planned Parenthood says we are.|`|p1dbG5U9aa	If they do, God will be pleased with them, And for those who bring harm to his small children will be better of casted in a lake  with a great millstone tied about their neck,  That is from the bible.<br>  That is what would happen if you were better off, so I guess he has worse things in mind. I do wonder if Obama has ever read the bible, or just the Koran. I would not be surprised if God did not strike him down before nov 4|`|uyNMfX6Kaa	Then use contraceptives. DO you know about STDs? What they should do is to put penalties to those women who are irresponsible and having sex without protection and transmitting STDs, that is costing a lot in health services. |`|uauJyxJNaa	No.  And I very much doubt they would even try.  <br>  <br>  It takes an army to change a law.  This isn't a dictatorship.  Any proposed bill would have to run through the senate.  And the senate is democrat, which is pro-choice.|`|vTicD6Uqaa	No. assuming Roe Vs wade was reversed it would be up to each State to determine the legality of abortion.<br>  <br>  You can relax... |`|AA10065077	Not by themselves. They can only appoint justices that would hopefully see it their way. But, for them to appoint justices one has to either die or step down to be replaced.|`|AA10963830	  No it is a smokescreen agenda item to rattle supporters or abortions. which I do support and I will vote for McCain not worried at all.|`|GEOamw3paa	No they don't have that much power.  All legislation has to go through a very specific system before they can be passed.  No worries, your rights are safe.  I don't think they would even try to do that.|`|zftm6qkKaa	When we fight against abortion we're inadvertently supporting safe abortions only for the affluent.<br>  <br>  That was a leading reason Roe v. Wade came to be. Back then, authorities never pulled dead rich women for back allies. It was the poor that suffered.<br>  <br>  Now as then, the affluent could care less what happens to us. They only use the abortion issue to stir our emotions in order to sucker us for our votes. Get it?|`|1laN1zSAaa	No, both McCain and Palin feel the abortion issue should be left up to the state's to decide. Don't worry as gov. Palin did not try to out law abortions or make it anymore difficult to obtain one. Neither McCain nor Palin would use their positions to try and push their individual beliefs onto the American people.|`|9nQ39d4Iaa	They said that they will leave that to the American Women to make that choice.  Palin said that she wouldn't butt in the Roe Vs. Wade either.  She was asked in a interview on which law that the Supreme Court decided on. Which one would she want to view.  That is all it was.  So no need to worry. |`|gUS2LnzBaa	Well they will have a chance to probably try to get some new people in the supreme court. So they could try to get people against Roe V. Wade so hopefully Abortion will be made Illegal. |`|6df4097400362ee8bfc71e8546d6d8b1aa	Yes, don't vote for them.|`|k4Xg3pI3aa	Nnnnnnnope. Not an executive decision. McCain won't touch it. If he cared about it he'd have taken a course of action in the last 26 years.<br>  <br>  No leader wants to deal with a bloated, uncared for population and a string of health and judicial issues that would arise as a result of unsanitary and illegal practices.|`|AA10193948	Technically, they have the power to appoint justices to the supreme court.  Which means if it goes back to the supreme court, it can be overturned.  Which would happen for certain if one of the pro-Roe vs. Wade judges have to step down for whatever reason.<br>  <br>  So yes, technically they do, but not directly.|`|ay6wF8Paaa	No they dont have that power. The supreme court does. Yes the presidents nominate Justice's but the Supreme court is not going to ever overturn it's own ruling. R v W is not gonna change. The people saying it is hanging by a threat are crazy...even though I am pro-life, I know the law isnt going to change.<br>  <br>  McCain/Palin '08|`|c5a85cfe9cbcc6dccde30454562993cdaa	No, Chief Justice Robert said that Roe v Wade is "settled law" as far as he is concerned, and he is not willing to overturn it,  he is a precedent guy, as are a majority of Judges.|`|HZy629kLaa	No, but they can appoint people to the Supreme Court who can make abortion illegal.|`|vXqjrENzaa	They are just like the Gestapo, they will take away ALL your Rights!!|`|B3H034Vtaa	No.|`|mHdKANPNaa	Scared are we?

6b9a8822d984eeabc0465c51421c4bfeaa	You need to be handed papers in person. Maybe it was the lender trying to scare you. With all the repo's going on maybe they just want you to pay it off or make the payments. You will just wake up one morning and you car will be gone. They dont take you to court until long after they have the car.|`|AA10065077	Who was that someone? If it was court offical then may be if it was the car loan people no you can't be arrested. Worst case scenario is your car is going to get repoed.

When you come to our country are most of not nice to you.<br>  <br>  I just dont see why most countries hate us, i guess it must be jealously|`|diDNl3BFaa	Political reasons. We have our hands in every third world government, and our global corporations push their way in everywhere and dominate and stifle the local economies. <br>   America is a new age empire, we do not need to physically control a country to dominate it. Economically is enough. <br>  <br>  They actually strive to emulate our lifestyle. Our culture is strong, and is actually our most positive import. However, when we try to force our culture down peoples throat, people do not react to that too well.|`|d1d43c8be7b4dd12bd1e7e90583bbe5eaa	If your a crappy person I don't much care where you come from I'll dislike you ... but generally concerning Americans ... it the ones with attitude ... most Americans I've met are fine ... but there are those from all over where when they're away from home nothing is ever good enough and all you hear is "it wouldn't happen at home" ... or ... " at home I could (whatever)" ... if it's so damn good at home ... why did you leave ...lol<br>  Now I've got that off my chest :-) <br>  Mostly though ... people are pretty cool|`|pNUtnoC8aa	There are many countries that do not approve of Western Civilization( America mostly). It is due to a variety of things including religion, politics, jealousy, and stereotyping Americans as greedy.|`|f9089da3646d378f6e78bf639f6a51c3aa	They hate freedom. |`|3YRrGfkiaa	It's neither one.  They don't like us because we throw our weight around, because we're ignorant of world affairs and proud of it, because we think the entire world revolves around us and call anyone who criticizes us "jealous."<br>  <br>  We're basically the biggest jerk at the party.  Why would other countries care about the internal political situation in the USA?  Why would they care about our lifestyle?|`|64SObnr5aa	Neither, it is what we do in the world.<br>  <br>  Such as propping up dictatorships, draconian governments, phony puppet governments, our thirst for oil and the willingness to do anything for it, including war and murder.  <br>  <br>  American people, for the most part, are highly regarded in the world, it is our government that is widely despised and hated.<br>  <br>  One must get outside of this country and spend sometime with other people to understand that.<br>  <br>  Signed<br>  A transplanted American living and working in China.<br>  <br>  Peace<br>  Jim<br>  <br>  .|`|AA11086243	well... just like in life... people can dislike you for many different reasons... religion... morals... attitude... ideas...<br>  <br>  much of the current "dislike" seems to be due to what other nations view as an overly-militaristic/aggressive attitude toward Iraq...<br>  <br>  invading a nation and then finding out the main reason you invaded them doesn't seem to be real... that's not a way to influence others and make friends...|`|v0mkDjYlaa	biggest reasons<br>  <br>  - US Government & US foreign policy<br>  - perceived rudeness and self-centeredness<br>  - perceived lack of modesty, loudness<br>  - perceived ignorance about other countries & cultures|`|fmDJJobTaa	It is called bigotry--when someone has pre-informed opinions of someone else based on false information and judges us upon it. <br>  <br>  After this correction is corrected for, they sometimes still hate us for it.|`|U8ORYrMEaa	Mostly political. Bush is the main reason. Thats why we need Obama, he will bring us world respect as well as peace again. McCain wants war with Russia and Iran already.|`|cD1dDuNDaa	THEY HATE US...watch where in the world is Osama Bin Laden...we're the spoiled brats or Earth.......they're just jealous though|`|S4OHLtnOaa	I think generally it is envy, but it also probably has a lot to do with the fact that many Americans, when they travel are not all that considerate to other nationalities.  I notice it myself sometimes when I am in an airport.  Kind of a condenscending attitude.  This is probably just a small percentage of our population that is like this but that small percentage makes a big impression when it comes to people repeating bad experiences.<br>  <br>  I don't think most people from other countries could pick out a conservative or a liberal from just the way a person carries themselves.  The political persuasion of the person probably has very little to do with the way that person is percieved.  It is mostly whether or not they are kind.<br>  <br>  When you travel, be kind. Do something nice for a person who is less fortunate than you.  I think that would go a long way to repairing the problem.|`|YzBVbvyWaa	Only speaking from personal experience it is the insular take many americans have on the world.<br>  <br>  Unless it happens in America or to America or involves America in some way, most Americans wouldn't know about it.<br>  <br>  When I was in America there was almost no International news on the tv, That is something we find very hard to come to terms with.|`|4s9OvB4eaa	I think sometimes it is a combination.  When I was in Germany in 2006, it seemed to be a fairly popular opinion of people there that our President is a ditz.  The people we met and interacted with had no problem sharing their thoughts about how sorry they were that we had to wait to get a new President.  The freedoms we are able to indulge in sometimes turn off, disgust, or otherwise intimidate some people in other countries.  For example, a lot of Canadians think it is outrageously ironic that we insist upon keeping handguns, then some of our kids get hold of them and shoot at one another or in schools.  Countries with strict religious bases don't really see our freedoms as freedom at all.  The things we are allowed to do on a day to day basis go against a lot of strict religions.|`|KqjVV3fhaa	Hello southern neighbour!  Personally, I enjoy most of the Americans that I've met or known in my life.  I do, however, know a number of Canadians who despise Americans.  This is the best that I can explain it.  It is partly to do with politics.  Think about being the strong silent type, mainly keeping to yourself.  Imagine what that person thinks of the loud mouthed who is always into someone else's business.  This is how other countries view US politics.  One more thing.  As individuals, Americans think more of themselves than they do of others, which is fine, but being completely ignorant of others and their cultures is.....well....ignorant.  Personally, I don't blame individuals for that, but the education system...and eventually the government.  Clear as mud eh?|`|Jus2p9ysaa	Good question! I have a lot of friends and business contacts from all over the world and in my experience it is both. To be a little more specific... most think the US are bullies... and most think that Americans are way too spoiled and take many things in Life for granted.  I have been to several countries myself, Thailand, Africa, Germany and that is too just name a few and you have to get to know their cultures and beliefs to see why they view us in they way they do. This however, is just from my own experience.|`|AA10065077	Other countries like our money that we give them but no hate us because they blame us for the fall of the economies around the world. To answer your question it's both. We have people like George Bush representing us on the world stage that has no idea of what is going on around him. America tends to be the police of the world.After two elections we have been laughed at from countries around the world. We are suppose to be the model of democracy and we can't even decide who is to run our country. Another is the people that travel are rude. Some have no knowledge or interest in the country that they are traveling to beside the scenery or business. They have no idea or interest in the culture. What is alright here may not be there. Here if someone came up to someone speaking French asking where something expecting them to know French the person being asked would probably be all rude and tell them to speak English in English and walk away per sieving the person speaking French rude. Yet that person will do a vi ca verse and the person speaking French is still rude.|`|Wr5Kvm7raa	it's the political position that america is in.they think they are the world leader (they probably are at the moment?)and they try to control lots of things in the world.because of that people hate and jealous of america, i think. what do u think?<br>  |`|m4qzRN0Waa	Actually the thing is that USA is trying to be the father of all countries that's why some people do not like USA.Ex:in the case of Georgia and Russia,that time also USA was in between of them.|`|8hEmS9qeaa	most of the world is jealous of all the material wealth we consume....people in the rest of the world will never have such things, and we are such a small portion (4%) of the world population.|`|6FdNYjl5aa	Foreigners don't like us because of our lack of morals a values.

So to answer your question, as long as a person is American they can vote in any election and like running for class president you can even vote for yourself...|`|gFeJR2V1aa	he can.  We both know who he's going to vote for and, even though I hate Obama, he really can't be trusted.  Bush is an idiot and a mistake, but Obama?  Damn America what the hell is wrong with you?|`|AA10065077	Yes he can vote. Since he is a registered Republican he must vote Republican. That means John McCain and whoever else is running for office that is a Republican.|`|aCZTXuuFaa	Yes, he can.|`|XE65WVrWaa	Duh- what planet are you from?|`|fbe600962a1348933b552a6e772b27b2aa	Yes, and each candidate votes too.

But does it really matter? It's not going to change a thing unless his vote is x100000000000 or something like that, then perhaps. |`|fUh7LHzvaa	Yes and he voted for McCain...the man who will continue Bush's legacy the next 4 years.<br>  <br>  |`|0537bcfc65bf84d976530137630ac41faa	Thats a good point.

AA10065077	The first time I would have done exactly as you did. Now, it sounds like the security guard is being retarded so I would at the policy for computer use.

Howard Stern, though definitely not a news source I would normally recommend, just did an interesting thing: he sent a guy out on the streets and asked African Americans the following:<br>  <br>  who you voting for,<br>  do you like Obama's choice, PALIN, as his vp,<br>  do you like that Obama opposes stem cell research,<br>  do you like that Obama is pro-life.<br>  <br>  While I only heard 3 responders, it's becoming apparent that there is an obvious, while small, percentage of voters that have no clue about his policies but support his skin color.<br>  <br>  I for one would have loved to see McCain pick JC Watts (former rep - Oklahoma) as his running mate.  The guy is smooth, intelligent, seemingly good character, and..by they way, did they tell you he was black? - making fun of Obama with that last one. <br>  <br>  Obama has also turned this race interestingly: he originally said race was off the table - that it was his policies on the table.  Then he came out with that "by the way, did we tell you he was black" comment.  He plays the race card in certain situations, then down plays it in others.  I find it pretty interesting.|`|oa9AqCkZaa	Existence is reality.<br>  It’s “wishful thinking” while anyone of any race strives to become President of the United States of America.<br>  It’s only real when the individual gets elected.<br>  When the tally is in November 4th, 2008; we’ll all know if the reality will be Obama as President of the United States of America.<br>  |`|cKOphHobaa	Do you really believe that the powers that control America, will allow a non-white America President?<br>  <br>  Although it may appear that the 2008 Democratic Presidential ticket has won the the election via the national popular vote on November 6, 2008, honestly, let's be realistic. <br>  <br>  It is not in the best interest or plans of the real powers that control America and the world, to allow a non-white American President. <br>  <br>  American Democratic Party ticket supporters need to prepare for major, catastrophic, disappointment, and all American's regardless of political affiliation, need to prepare for the outcome and results, in more ways than one.<br>  <br>  (this) "Country First!"

fGE7hL12aa	I don't think anyone is opposed to health and well being. <br>  <br>  The opposition to government funded universal health care is the cost. The answer to universal health care is to reduce the cost of health care, thus reducing the cost of health insurance and making it affordable to more people. <br>  <br>  It's not how you pay for it that matters, its how much you pay!<br>  <br>  (We spend too much on schools as well!)|`|3KXBzSzfaa	Good point.......Personally I think we need to bring the cost of hospitalization down and lower health insurance.  $20 bucks an asprin is not wholesale. Unlike teachers doctors tend to see the bottom line and thats more cash.|`|bf621e05dd1c4f89ff36b9fdce162254aa	Poster "Maybe" - what planet are you on?  Because I really don't think it is Earth!<br>  <br>  Health, like education, should be a public good.  Like roads.  If you don't want publicly funded health care or education, then you shouldn't want roads, a government funded military, or any other public good.  Go pay for your own road when you want it.  Hire your own soldiers.<br>  <br>  Greatest health care system?  What?  In your country people DIE if they can't afford treatment.  That is murder.  Murder of the people by the people - the GREEDY people, like you!  You want to make sure the poor can't get an education - keeps down the competition for good jobs, good houses, good cars - leaves more for the rich to get richer.<br>  <br>  Nothing wrong with private health care or private education, we have that too - but a public system is mandatory in a civilised society - and if you don't have that sort of system, you are NOT a civilised society, you are still in caveman mentality. <br>  <br>  Thank goodness I don't live in America!<br>  <br>  Note to "Bossy" - religion has NO place in schools.  None whatsoever.  Pray in schools?  Religion is a private matter, praying can be done at home or in a church if necessary.  NOT in a place of education.  Private religious schools can serve that purpose if parents are uneducated enough to force religion onto their children.|`|d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	Let's get one thing straight here. Shall we? I do not oppose the well being of fellow citizens, nor do I believe that anyone should be denied health care. What I oppose is taking money from hard working, responsible Americans to pay for others who in many cases are neither of these things. While we are on the subject though let's also dispel the myth you are trying to create here. No American is denied health care. The government does not exist to provide for your every need. The government exists to protect the people from enemies. The Constitution does not guarantee you health care. It guarantees you a level playing field in which to succeed or fail on your own merits. Lastly, yes I do support publicly funded schools because education is important for success in life. |`|h48DzLdzaa	Sorry, but the government should not even run the schools.  We waste entirely too much money with them as it is.  Now we want them to mess up the greatest health care system that ever existed.  It's the insurance system that is flawed.  If the system is run by the government it will destroy health CARE.  Look at Social Security, the School System, Welfare, and just about anything the government touches.  We are slowing turning Socialist as we speak and it is just speeding up everyday.  The government should govern not control our lives.  And NO, the basic roles of the government are not to ensure all of it's citizens are healthy, in mind and body.  The basic role is protect and defend.|`|UWlDUSjiaa	Absolutely.  Unless your society is an exclusive one.|`|5n4QRjcraa	Yes, I am, private schools and competition would better our kids education. Right now, they all have to conform to what ever the public schools system wants. Why would you think 80% Christians like the fact our kids can't pray at schools? Our schools are disgusting socialistic institutions..

We aren't stupid, lazy or looking for handouts. <br>  <br>  Let's look back in time for a minute...humor me...<br>  <br>  When your parents were saving for a house....the rich weren't getting tax breaks at their expense. As a matter of fact, up through Clintons presidency, it was the more you make, the more you pay. It was fair. You made more, you could afford to pay more. Those people weren't going bankrupt because they had to pay a little more in taxes. <br>  <br>  Take a look at the present. People are losing their jobs, their homes (and that lovely bill for high risk loans was signed before the dems took over congress 2 years ago), their possessions. The middle class went from paying reasonable taxes to paying the rich's share that Bush pardoned for them. <br>  <br>  Were people ignorant while getting a loan for a house they couldn't afford? Absolutely. Are the banks partly responsible for giving loans they knew couldn't be paid back? You betcha!  Are BOTH parties at fault? Yes, to a degree. <br>  <br>  Congrats on working hard and making something of yourself. But please, don't assume that all Dems are lazy bums who don't want to work and frivolously blow our money. I know quite a few republicans living off the welfare system. Welfare is not a party issue. It's a human issue. <br>  <br>  As a democrat, you might be shocked to know....I have a home. I have a nice car. My husband works a 40 hour shift at a hospital and then works one 24 hour shift and one 12 hour shift as a part-time firefighter/paramedic. I've been a stay at home mom for 9 years. I went back to college in that time, got a degree and now, I can't find a job. We've done really well up until these last 4 years. Now I NEED to go to work and can't find a damn job anywhere. <br>  <br>  Bush has brought this country down. Nobody can deny that. The proof is in the economy and his approval rating. You cannot seriously blame the Dems when you've had a republican president for the last 8 years. Not saying we aren't at fault to a degree, but the President has had 8 long years to work this out and he's failed miserably. People don't want to risk another four. |`|EcrCIqP7aa	With the token one, his supporters will not tolerate anyone saying anything against him. Even if it is true. Is it not great that they embrace free speech.<br>  <br>  I also own my own home. It is paid off and all, in fact everything I own is free and clear.<br>  <br>  I do not like the idea of me having to pay off some ones home loan that they could not afford.<br>  <br>  I know blame the ones selling them the loan. How could anyone in their right mind sign a mortgage paper that says you owe 1,200.00 a month when you only make 1,000.00 a month.I guess that goes with the Clinton's fuzzy math they were trying to push on America<br>  <br>  If they did that then they should suffer, refinance it to a 50 year loan so the payments are lower, but they should not be able to walk away and leave the people that did the right thing holding the bag.<br>  <br>  It was barney franks Chris Dodd Chuck Schumer and the rest of the dems that blocked regulation into Fannie and Freddie because barney was playing with the head of Fannie's, Fannie. He should be in jail along with the rest of them.<br>  <br>  As for the token one. He is a socialist Marxist and he hates America. How you liberals could back him just shows that what I was told long ago was right. That America will be destroyed from within.|`|MqN3xUyqaa	If you are serious about your patriotism and family values, you will read this with an open mind. First, the Democrats and Republicans are both responsible for the mortgage problems. How? The Republicans voted for no regulations for mortgage lenders, then the Democrats allowed the lending to the underprivileged in the hopes that they could repay these loans. The real culprits were the mortgage lenders who gave these loans to people who did not qualify. P.S. Those people were told by the mortgage lenders that they did qualify. You cannot expect every home buyer to be a financial expert. Low income people (mostly minorities) were misled by the lenders (just like credit card companies do). So they are not expecting handouts and they did not know that they did not qualify. I am a democrat who supports taking away that power from wall street and give the middle class more compensation for their work and sacrifice. I am also a veteran of 20 years who went through that experience.

Maybe I can help.<br>  <br>  I think most supporters of prop 8 would argue Marriage is a biblical idea.  They would be right, marriage is a concept that was passed down from God, with the definition that one man and one woman become one flesh.<br>  <br>  I don't feel like people who support prop 8 are judging other people, well some are probably, I can't speak for everyone, but the problem is, a homosexual relationship does not fit the definition of marriage.  <br>  <br>  Supporters of 8 probably see it as unreasonable that, for a concept that is biblical and has been handed down by God, people who are not believers in God or want anything to do with God, would demand the definition of marriage be changed for them.<br>  <br>  I believe gays should have the exact same rights as straight people, that is unquestionable.  The government should make civil unions, or whatever they are called (sorry I don't know all the terms), completely equal with marriage.  <br>  <br>  They can leave marriage as a term reserved for couples that meet the definition, but homosexuals are still given equal rights.|`|Jsj1zLfgaa	I don't see why this issue has had to come this far.<br>  <br>  Someone said that grammar and spelling will get you farther in this world than the Bible will.

Everyone has their own opinion and they also have the right to express it. For people to look down on another persons opinions, their the ones who are iggnorant. Now let me just make this clear. I am a HUGE supporter for Yes on 8. I'm not a very strong religious person but when I was a little girl, all I could think about was my wedding day. I was also taught that marriage is sacred and between a man and a woman. But before all of you gay marriage supporters jump on my case and tell me what a horrible person I am, I'd advise you to save it. First off, let me just say, we've banned gay marriage before, what makes you think we won't again? I'm so sick of us passing this and then some gay couple getting their panties in a bunch and complaining about the fact that "Oh we can't get married blah blah blah." Isn't having a civil partnership just as good. You sould be happy that we'll even give you that. You're lucky we don't ban gay partnership all together. Look, leave the church alone. It's not a territory you should cross. Why would you want to get married in a church where god sees you as an abomination??? Just think about that.

Whoever voted yes on this proposition is completely ignorant, and ultimately trying to promote the idea of legally being prejudice.  <br>  <br>  Now, for those who argue for prop 8 on a religious point of view, you all are the biggest hypocrites of all time.  In the Bible, it clearly states that you should not judge, even if you do say that you don't care what they do with their lifestyle, because you don't wanna judge, you're still judging when you vote yes.  You are literally judging that their lifestyle isn't good enough to have the same rights as you.  Who are you to say what one person may have the right to do?  It's not like the right is harmful to you.  Many arguments for religious groups also say that they believe in the Bible and the Bible clearly blasphemies gay acts.  But if you believe in your Bible, then why do a majority of the religious people do other things that the Bible clearly states is wrong, such as: premarital sex, living with your companion, lying, speaking about rumors, drinking alcohol, smoking, doing drugs, using cuss words, listening to  secular music, watching filth on t.v., masterbating, porn, honestly the list could go on and on.  You can't pick and choose what you believe and what you live by, especially when it comes upon choosing on someone's rights.  The whole excuse of churches losing their tax exemption if prop 8 doesn't pass, or also opening the door for a lawsuit if one reverend decides to not marry a gay couple is simply not true.  Churches are considered a charitable organization, nothing in there states that it can be taken away becuase the rights of gays.  Also, because of freedom of speech, a reverend can simply tell a gay couple that they would not be able to marry them because of their religion.  Needless to say, many gays wouldn't even want to step foot in a church do to the way the church treats them as a whole.  Furthermore, there is definitely supposed to be a distinguish between the church and state, meaning that we can't mix religion with the law of the land.  It's contradiciting.  You may live and believe in your ways, but shall not impede your ways on those who don't want it.  Just the same as gays, they aren't impeding their lifestyle on you, they jus want the same rights.  So instead of spending so much time in tryin to seperate the gays, why don't you do what would be right, show them what it is like to know Jesus, that he loves you no matter what you do and he'll take you in as you are.  Show them the joy, that you claim that you have from him.  The more you represent and present yourself as a true christian and not a hypocritical christian, the more people will be drawn to you.  <br>  <br>  As for the non religious point of view.  It is the very first words of the Constitution, that "All men are created equal" meaning everyone of us should have the same rights as each other.  For those stupid commercials tryna hve you vote yes on 8, they are truly dispicable.  The one that says that 4 judges "forced" these rights on those who oppose the gay marriage, are ridiculous.  First of all, I never knew that having rights "forced" on to someone were a bad thing for someone to have.  Last I knew, rights were something that evryone wanted.  Second of all, if these are rights, then that means that its right for them to have right? Right.  Those commercials that say domestic partners already have the same rights, are absurd.  If domestic partners had the same rights, then wouldn't it be considered marriage anyway? There would be no such thing as domestic partners.  Gays, as well as senior citzens who are heterosexual use this option, knowing that its not the same.  Domestic partners only have 54 out of 1068 rights that a married couple has.  So no, they do not have the same rights.  Its true that one can have medical coverage through their partner, but did you know that their premiums could be higher? And also that the insurance company can challenge the persons "insurable interest".  Yeah domestic partners can inherit money or land if their partner passes, but did you know their tax rates are almost double of what a married spouse would have to pay?  There is no divorce court for domestic partners, only married couples.  A domestic partner isn't covered on their partner's rental car.  Look up the differences between the rights of domestic partners and married couple.  They are not completely the same.  As for the gay marriage being taught in schools, again false.  96 percent of the schools in california, are required to teach about sex ed, which includes the reproductive system, and mainly protection again HIV and AIDS, some programs speak on abstinence, however it does not clearly state that a marriage is between a man and a woman, it means abstinence as in marryin the person you love.

9miRWroqaa	I am an Alaskan. I am proud of Palin. I admire her going from Alaska politics to the National scene. She was not ready for the ravenous dogs of the liberal media. Her knowledge stems from issues that are important to Alaska and Alaskans. She buried herself in the issues of facing Alaska. The news media wants to portray her as an idiot hick from Alaska. They are wrong about her. She is very intelligent. There is no task that she is not willing to tackle full on. She has the courage to take on the corruption and waste in Washington. |`|ViZH5twNaa	Actually it has been the same this entire time.

She did get me more active campaigning against her and McCain though.  I'll be making calls every day between now and the election to get out the votes against them in the swing states. I'd already spent one day canvasing in VA prior to that speech but might do another next weekend too. |`|BUS5PJEmaa	No pretty much the same. The only thing, different I would say is she might be being set up by the right. <br>  <br>  For example she gave a policy speech on special needs kids...in that speech she mocked earmarks for the study of fruit flies. Well fruit fly studies have lead to discoveries regarding autism. Who wrote that speech for her....why did they pick fruit flies for her to mock?

Obama's only real competition was Edwards. No one liked Hillary until the Rev. Wright scandal came into play, and everyone was desperately trying to elect Hillary as their candidate. However, it was too late and Obama had already won. You're only argument against McCain is that he is old, which I think is a positive quality in a president. Palin was McCain's choice and if he had faith in her I did as well. Biden as Obama's running mate still astounds me. How he could get away with screaming change and then choose a running mate who has spent 20 years in the Senate doesn't make any sense. With Dems, it's obvious you don't really need to make sense.<br>  <br>  Reagan and Ford didn't die until they were 93. McCain is 72,  so I guess he should just curl up and stop living his life now, huh? In other countries, they respect their elderly. In ours, we just treat them as throw-away people. It's very sad. Obama has never been in charge of ANYTHING, and you believe that is a good quality in a president? I don't understand your logic.|`|ruYcE8i0aa	The GOP had a whole host of candidates younger than McCain – they weren't really "saving" any for later. Almost all of the big names in the GOP were either in the primaries or on the VP short list. McCain just happened to be the winner in the primaries, and a lot of GOP insiders were unhappy when he was. And of course his inept campaign managers pressured him into picking Palin – the second-worst move of his campaign behind his response to the economic collapse in mid-September.<br>  <br>  I don't think they played to lose. There's just not much of a long-term advantage to that strategy.|`|zfFjKhJJaa	She would be far better at running a country than any other of the 4.

McCain wanted to pick this "female" vote-up. What he forgot to do was, you know, pick a female like Clinton... a qualified, strong female.

They all fell one by one during the primaries. McCain is despised by many in the republican party. When it became clear that he would be the nominee, they made a half -hearted show of support during the critical early stages.To ensure more support, he passed on Lieberman as his V.P. nod, choosing Palin instead in a cynical ploy to garner disappointed Hillary supporters. When he continued to lag behind Obama, he went negative in a big way. <br>  <br>  <br>  Within the year, his campaign will be getting discussed in colleges and high schools around the country as an example of how to do almost everything wrong in a presidential bid.|`|hv3gyI9Eaa	bad economy,war,and hate of people lifestyles.<br>   |`|k4Xg3pI3aa	Mitt - failed because he was Mormon and perceived as too liberal.<br>  Huck - failed because he was viewed as regressive and too tied to his faith.<br>  Rudy - failed because he thought he could miss the first primaries and still win.<br>  Paul - failed because his profile is too low and he's not a conservative, he's a libertarian (I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that, but honestly...there's your REAL GOP maverick...go start a libertarian party, Ron)<br>  Fred - was just a little too befuddled and hangdog.<br>  |`|f2af9abbd07b024c845bf28f97ee9b35aa	i have heard these theories a lot too.

Es cierto que ese régimen adolece de muchisimos defectos.  El régimen tenía que terminarse.  Espero que te des cuenta de que me estoy refiriendo al régimen, no al partido.<br>  <br>  Durante los 70 a?os que gobernó el PRI, la oposición era prácticamente decorativa y no cumplia con su verdadera función social que es la de criticar constructivamente y en ocasiones frenar las iniciativas y actos del gobierno que vayan en contra del interés del país.<br>  <br>  El problema es que durante esos 70 a?os de gobierno, los mexicanos nos mal acostumbramos a un régimen subyascente en ese régimen priista, que es el régimen de la empleomanía.<br>  <br>  La empleomanía es un vicio social que consiste en mantener una sociedad de burocratas acostumbrados a pedir un "puesto" o "hueso" en el gobierno del cual mantenerse.  Es el vivir cotidiano que vemos en todas las dependencias de gobierno de desempleados que buscan a un amigo o conocido que les pueda dar un trabajo de burocratas en el gobierno.<br>  <br>  En el a?o 2000 cuando se dio la alternancia de partidos PAN en lugar de PRI, comenzo el fin del regimen priista pero no el régimen de la empleomanía.<br>  <br>  Aunque a muchos les va a doler lo que les voy a decir, la verdad es que tanto los panistas como los perredistas (y demas partidos minoritarios) son practicantes asiduos de la empleomanía.  Todos quieren que llegue determinado partido porque ese partido ofrece la oportunidad de llenar puestos publicos y beneficiar a grupos de poder con son minoria comparado con el total de la población.  Las pocas dependencias de gobierno que tienen servicio civil de carrera lo ofrecen a sus empleados de base (que estan sindicalizados y por ende: son inamovibles).  Algunas leyes se han promulgado que indican que en la burocracia federal los puestos de director general e inferiores son inambibles. Pero queda la bucrocracia estatal y la burocracia federal.  Cualquiera que diga que no hay empleomania es los gobiernos de los estados y los municipios es porque no la ha padecido o no le conviene verla.<br>  <br>  Por esta razón pienso que la función social que actualmente hacen los partidos políticos(TODOS) es más bien de servir de club social para agremiar a todos los que quieran un puesto en el gobierno usando acciones politicas populistas para llegar al poder y beneficiarse de el.  Una actuación que insulta la verdadera función política de un partido que debería ser la de velar por el bienestar de los mexicanos, y proteger los intereses del país antes que los intereses de su partido.<br>  <br>  Si creen que estoy equivocado dejenme preguntarles: ?de verdad  sienten que los más de 100,000 (cien mil pesos) mensuales que ganan los diputados valen por el trabajo que hacen? ?Tomar una pancarta y subir a un estrado se paga con esa cantidad? Porque si es asi que alguien me diga donde me apunto porque yo tambien quiero que me paguen por ir a chiflar adentro de la camara de diputados. ?Cuantos diputados de verdad LEEN las reformas de leyes que estan firmando? ?Cuando vamos a cansarnos los mexicanos de oir pretextos tan terribles como: "NO LEIMOS LA LEY CUANDO LA FIRMAMOS"?<br>  <br>  ?Es todo esto obra del PRI?<br>  <br>  Les doy mi palabra que no soy priista; pero ahora estamos en presencia de un fenomeno social:  Nuestra sociedad mexicana, que cree que vive en la democracia en realidad esta aprendiendo a penas como es la democracia.<br>  <br>  ?Como podemos decir que vivimos en un régimen democrático en México cuando el pueblo no sabe elegir a sus gobernantes?.  Porque votar por un candidato porque me cae bien, es mi compadre o me va a dar trabajo, o porque me gustan los colores del partido, no son criterios para elegir a gobernante.  ?Cuantos mexicanos saben cual es el ideario político del partido por el que estan votando? ?cuantos saben cual es la plataforma política del candidato? ?cuantos saben como inconformarse con su gobierno cuando sienten que este no esta haciendo bien su trabajo? (Y POR FAVOR:  tomar por la fuerza edificios públicos, secuestrar el estrado de la camara de diputados, montar bloqueos en paseo de la reforma y quemar casas en Oaxaca NO CUENTAN).<br>  <br>  Y así queremos llamarnos una democracia.<br>  <br>  Como estan las cosas en el momento actual, es necesario e imperioso que hay al menos TRES fuerzas politicas para balancear el equilibrio del poder politico en el país.  Es necesario que evitemos a toda costa que haya un solo partido acapare todo el poder.    Pero es mas necesario que primero aprendamos a dialogar y más que eso: que entendamos (especialmente los políticos) que primero es México, después México y para terminar México.  Y si hay lugar para alguien más ese es México.<br>  <br>  Pero que puede esperarse de políticos que "se dedican a interpretar la voluntad del pueblo" HACIENDO QUE ESTA SE PAREZCA A SU PROPIA VOLUNTAD.<br>  <br>  Y si no les parece diganme, ?quien les dijo a los diputados que le pueden quitar autonomia al IFE? Por que yo no lo dije, ni lo deseo ni lo apruebo.  Eso es solo la voluntad de 500 fulanos que nada tienen que ver conmigo y les prometo que no tienen nada que ver con ustedes.  o qué, ?a poco les fueron a preguntar?|`|ryLIVp0daa	No comparto tu apinion, aqui cualquiera que llega al poder del partido que sea sigue siendo la misma gata nadamas que revolcada, es indignate esta situación, pero el lo personal no creo en ningún político, por que como decía maquiavelo quieres conocer a alguien realmente DALE PODER,  y eso de que si tiene derecho o no, todos los partidos existen y todos pelean por  el hueso o me equivoco?<br>  es más los que verdaderamente quieren ser buenos se corrompen o definitivamente los desaparecen (no generalizo) por que hay algunos que los desaparecen pero por wena gente jaja ya sabes a lo que me refiero|`|ow2YvuNiaa	De acuerdo contigo en todo, y creo que no se trata de fe, en hacia el partido si no ignorancia pues creo que no puede aver otro calificativo ademas, recordemos que aunque no igual el PRI tine mucho poder aun pues recuerda que todos los sindicatos estan llenos de PRISTAS; asi los corruptos de los sindicatos y recordemos que en esa area hay muchos intereses de por medio,
GWRP3vLQaa	To protect witnesses<br>  To avoid the embarrassment of an open trial|`|AA10065077	Do you mean he wants his trial closed or the transcripts from a closed trial? If he wants transcripts then he wants to review them before motioning for something and to help to get the judge to let him get his motion he would use the transcript of that person vs person. If you mean their trial here are some reasons to protect witnesses, don't want to be embarressed with people and the media watching. Closed can also be the judge decides guilty or innocent instead of a jury. So that can mean the trial be over faster and it's easier to convince one person instead of 12.

They are focusing more to become president to provide better for their families. Once they get in office the speech goes something like this "The promises that was made can not be granted due to the fact that it will cost the tax payers more money and we have to start thinking about the future of the American people" then will hear them apologize. People asked why is the stocks going down, if president obama won people need to realize that the stocks are ran by money not presidents Obama, McCain or everybody else can not fix the problems this country have overnight I mean any intelligent person should know that. Please stop putting trust in a man or any man just because they say something doesn't mean it is official. Parties have to vote on it which mean that it may get approve or it may not and taxing people who make over 200,000 would not be passed due to the fact that he makes over that and the people that have to consider passing whatever he want makes over that(start thinking) and I sit back and wonder what was going on this year I mean what a JOKE both campaigns was with Mavericks, Mccain lying saying he do not know how many houses he have, Sarah Palin(say it ain't so JOE),Joe the Plumber scare tactics,Palin on SNL(saturday night live) acting a d@mn fool obama wearing a mask on SNL,brushing his shoulders off plus him and michelle doing the "fist bump" on TV I mean think obama even said he can not accomplish everything he wants in the first hundred days or even the first term so what is going to happen if it isn't a 2nd term for him.Look at how Bush tried to reform Social Security and got nowhere but when it was to pass a 700billion dollar bill for us tax payers to pay that was approved real fast. Why didn't that money go to the people who lost their homes and jobs instead it went to the stock market to bail our some crooks  Start thinking people time to care about yourself because nobody is going to care about you and your family but you anyway Take Care and God Bless|`|e5acb3af51b48dae1a6445da769c1569aa	hmm... get back to us in 4 years....you'll all be denying u voted for him! |`|HlLWt74maa	They won't take this very well - they are losing their very state of reality right now - they think they live in a Communist State full of Socialist "friends of terrorists" - by the way, why didn't Barack let Bill Ayers get on stage last night?

En mi familia hemos aprendido que es mejor ahorrar un poco más para comprar las versiones top de cada modelo.<br>  Además la gasolina afecta a todos. ?Como crees que llegan las verduras al súper? ?En burro??Y la carne, la ropa, los electrodomésticos, muebles, el vino, en fin lo que sea que compres?|`|AA10812072	OK. mejor antes de enojarte explícanos que es un Lojack porque al parecer ninguno sabemos que es.

No se necesita pertenecer a un partido político, sino a una clase social, y te recuerdo que en México hay 40% de personas que viven en pobreza extrema.... por eso nadie "ladra". <br>  <br>  Otro robo es la tenencia....

RVVoQuhTaa	The entire reason the electoral college was chosen as the way to select the president was so states with a higher population would not be able to control the government and put forth their interests over states with a lower population. <br>  <br>  Back when our nation was founded, a main concern was that each state be represented equally. Since the majority of the population was in the northern states, the southern states were worried that the North would dominate the government under the popular vote, and Northern interests would be championed at the expense of the South.<br>  <br>  Smaller states like Delaware and Rhode Island had this concern as well, fearing that they would be swallowed up by the larger states.<br>  <br>  In using the electoral college, the Founding Fathers created yet another check and balance to prevent tyranny and dictatorship. If the popular vote were used nowadays, the vote from both coasts would always determine the election, and the middle states would never have a say.<br>  <br>  |`|gwUMipsUaa	This had to do with long before computers came about..at least that's one of the reasons.  There was no way to possibly keep a good count on votes, so they divided that up.  Whichever way the popular vote went meant one electoral vote.  At least that's what I understand.<br>  <br>  Idaho went red, Washington, Oregon and Hawaii blue, Alaska red.  I voted McCain.<br>  <br>  Edit: First Poster...look again, McCain had 56 percent of the vote.  That means popular vote.|`|vpL67nETaa	The elector college system is highly flawed and should be abolished.<br>  <br>  It was created a long long time ago when they didn't trust the people to vote an elected official.<br>  <br>  One of the major unfair components is this.<br>  The democrats will always win NY, NJ, and California.<br>  Look how many electoral votes those states have!<br>  Compared to a state like Maine or Mississippi or Alaska, which, even if they always went Republican (they don't always) isn't any sort of leg up. KWIM?|`|vRY2vExRaa	The electoral college is a good thing for smaller, less populated states.  Your issue with the timing of poll closing has to do with the U>S> stretching over 5 time zones.  The only way to alleviate the effect of a winner being chosen before everyone votes could only be accomplished if voting results were withheld until after the closing of polls in all states.  Do you see the media agreeing to that? This link explains why the college was instituted:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.multied.com/elections/Electoralcollgewhy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.multied.com/elections/Elector...</a>|`|FzbK0Prpaa	Obama's would wiped his *** also. Don't you know Obama got almost 8 million more votes that Mcccain. So anyway "The Mac" would have gotten beaten.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	You mention the smaller states not counting under the Electoral College. But actually, the EC overweights the vote from smaller states. That's one of the reasons it still exists -- not only does it give small states a say, but it makes their votes worth more than votes from larger states. What I mean is that while New York state has 31 electoral votes, that works out to 1 electoral vote for every 622,000 residents (19,300,000 / 31), while in Wyoming, 3 little electoral votes works out to 1 electoral vote for every 171,000 residents (515,000 / 3). A Wyoming vote carries about 3.5 times as much weight as a New York vote, thanks to the EC.<br>  <br>  That's the primary reason the electoral vote winner has come out different from the popular vote winner on a few occasions. The smaller states sometimes skew the results.<br>  <br>  Without the EC, people in small states would have even less incentive to vote, because the country's big population centers -- NYC, LA, Chicago -- would determine the outcome of every election.<br>  <br>  I see you're also saying the outcome was known before some states out West even closed. But that could happen with a popular vote, too. NYC is in the Eastern time zone, and Houston, San Antonio, and Chicago are in the Central zone. If we went strictly by popular vote, those four cities on their own could decide the outcome -- and their polls would be closed before the West Coast finished voting. <br>  <br>  I think the only way to make things fair for the West is for the networks to not project a winner until the polls are all closed! I wouldn't have a problem with that. I can wait a few extra hours before knowing the outcome ...|`|4RPAH5NSaa	I don't agree with the popular vote being more effective. The only people that would have any say in the election would be in California, Texas and New York. NO thank you. However I would be supportive of splitting each states' electoral college according to percentage of popular vote in each state, as Nebraska currently does. I think it would give the electoral college a more realistic weight of the popular vote than the current winner-take-all method.|`|3ada8e29432baa4a01f51631e5555a82aa	The Electoral College is a GREAT institution. it prevents politicans from making a beeline for NY, California and Florida and other population centers, and ignoring most of the country. <br>  <br>  |`|a6U2ZRdJaa	Agreed..  The electoral college system screwed Obama out of Texas.  McCain had 38% of the votes for god's damn sake!!!!|`|Oeqj5OvDaa	I learn so much guys, I NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHY <br>  thanx for the Q. <br>  but if it was by popular vote we would of never had a George W. Bush <br>  |`|c4915188681351ae48e3e8dbbb67e2baaa	I agree! That was the very problem with the 2000 US Elections!|`|AA11326235	This question has been asked since the country's inception.  I believe it more or less has to do with the fact that we are a federation of 50 different states. <br>  One argument is that a political candidate could possibly win an election by promising things to the states with the largest populations at the expense of the other states. It is based on the same reasoning behind having 2 senators from each state regardless of population.<br>  Remember that at our beginning we were a United Group of 13 different countries.  This was true up intil the civl war.<br>  When a young man then said he was fighting for his country, he didn't mean the United States as much as he did his country of Virgina or Maryland, or wherever he happened to be from.   <br>

I respect him enough to wait until September before I make a final decision (I don't expect good news). When the report comes out I would try to look behind the positive spin I'm sure Bush will impose on him and see what he has to say.<br>  <br>  The Iraq War in one word: Unnecessary<br>  In two words: Unnecessary Tragedy<br>  In three words: Bush's Unnecessary Tragedy|`|0ZpcLuAHaa	Patreaus is nearing the end of the "surge" operation.

In the loosest sense of the word it is.|`|3b1d5d6ecc8d46e0998abbfc23675d39aa	Patraeus is getting ready to recommend "stay the course" in yet another fashionable costume.  This is all about long term contracts for Exxon, Halliburton etc., to develop and sell us and the world future Iraqi oil reserves.  And, lest we forget about it, the oil pipeline across Afghanistan from the Caspian Sea.  The plan is to have permanent US military bases to secure this goal all across the middle east.  Bush is not so cleverly working to make this permanent policy for the US, and instability in Iraq works for his goal, as it not only forces Iraqis to submit to US pressure to give up their oil, but it forces many here to fall for the "if Iraq falls we are in danger in the US" argument.  <br>  No bid contracts are part of the plundering Bush and his friends are doing to the National Treasury, not only for  Halliburton and the like, but for the weapons industry in general, for they get the similar treatment from the Pentagon while making weapons, etc. for the war machinery.  Of course this is dishonorable, but we should all know by now BushOilCo was not founded on honor!|`|o2oI3qz1aa	Great Answer Michelsan!!!! You hit the nail on the head with that answer!!!|`|Dhf33X9Laa	Dave Pateaus has to believe in what he's saying and doing.  There are many innocent lives in his hand.

hmA8nfA2aa	Your background would be investigated thoroughly, and viewed in its entirety in order to determine your suitability for becoming a police officer. You would also be required to pass an in-depth psychological evaluation. Much of what you wrote would raise red flags. If you haven't had any incidents due to anger management problems for a number of years, and you pass the psychological evaluation, you could become a police officer. The more time that passes from any problems, etc. the better you chances would probably be.

RRFbDou9aa	The general  difference is murder is intentional, manslaughter is not.<br>  <br>  Generally:<br>  1st degree murder: you decided to kill them beforehand (even if just a few moments) and did so<br>  2nd degree murder: you killed them intentionally on the spur of the moment<br>  <br>  1st degree manslaughter: you accidentally killed someone through reckless action<br>  2nd degree manslaughter: you accidentally killed someone through negligence.|`|3h2ulvpfaa	Manslaughter is a legal term for the killing of a human being, in a manner considered by law as less culpable than murder.<br>  <br>  Manslaughter is usually broken down into two distinct categories: voluntary manslaughter and involuntary manslaughter.<br>  <br>  This is particularly true within the law of homicide, where murder requires either the intent to kill—a state of mind called malice—or malice aforethought, which may involve an unintentional killing, but with a wilful disregard for life.|`|eA0AwzJ0aa	Manslaughter is like an accidental murder, as in self defense..murder is something that was done intentionally, like walking up to someone and shooting them in the face!|`|AA10065077	Manslaughter is when the killing just happened. There was no thought or planning. |`|93bb2649f329b412f6562a3a76a57633aa	Technically, manslaughter refers to ANY killing of a person.

Im really getting sick and tired of those as well saying that if u don't vote Obama that we automatically are racist or bigoted or hate him!...Hell no, like i said before, he is a man that has a dream to be the president of the united states of america...kudos to him for even being nominated! but i believe mccain is far more suited for this presidency! |`|AA10065077	Yes Obama is a human but I too fear him.

NWuqUnFpaa	I'd say that it's the wild west right now out there. Nothing is claimed until its developed. The west was won by building railroads and roads.<br>  <br>  The Vikings found North America long before any more modern European explorers did, should they have first claim? Or maybe Columbus should have claim on behalf of Spain? Or the Natives who lived on the land before European colonization?|`|DDbWKBKjaa	What would be the dimensions of the claim?  Just saying "It's ours"?  The international community would not respect the claim, and would disagree.  It's been far too long since anyone's set foot there; in order to make a successful claim to sovereignty over uninhabited territory, you need to "display" - i.e. patrol it, survey it, treat it as yours, be seen to exercise control.<br>  <br>  Now, claiming by unilaterally setting up a settlement...that would be pretty tough for anyone to argue with.  Of course, the moon is a pretty big place, and it would be impossible to exercise meaningful control of the whole surface from a handful of settlements; if the Russians later created their own settlement elsewhere on the surface of the moon, there wouldn't be a whole lot the Americans could say about that, either.  The immediate consequence, if anyone cared enough about who got the moon, would simply be another space race to get as much of the surface under effective control as possible.|`|AA10065077	No we don't own the moon we just have a flag on it so that if there is ever anything valuable found on the moon it's ours. There is a treaty regarding outer space and Antartica that the countries must follow.|`|J6lnsOdYaa	We don't own the moon and I don't recommend we claim it, because if we did, we would owe back property taxes which would bankrupt the US the rest of the way, far more than Alan Greenspan ever thought of doing.|`|tkj1piEkaa	We never landed on the moon so I would say that no one owns it. |`|JCwZT1OVaa	no, i saw it first, and called dibbs|`|EPqnB7Epaa	Nobody owns the moon.  Plus, your assessment of the relationship between the UN and the US isn't very accurate.|`|gfwsKzNBaa	Finders Keepers|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	It's mine, and I have the deed right here in my hand.  Don't own all the mineral rights, though, those apparently belong to George Lucas.|`|YBW1uVgkaa	yep,we own the moon and mars.so who is going to dispute the claim.....|`|d10c7fc96d98c9c741a090a216616361aa	No one nation can "own" the moon, or space around Earth.|`|0trJfw7Waa	i think so, and mars is ours too - the robot was american|`|vTBMHe1baa	I don't know why the question would get deleted, because it is a good one.<br>  <br>  Human exploration and expansion always leads to territorial disputes, and the exploration of space is no different.<br>  <br>  Right now, no one owns the Moon, for the simple fact that no one "possesses" the Moon.<br>  <br>  No one occupies or controls the logistics that concern the exploration of, or expansion across, the Moon; such as Lunar Travel, Lunar Colonization, or Lunar Resource Exploitation.<br>  <br>  Once a country, corporation or other such entity establishes their control over these logisitical factors, only then will they be able to claim sovereignty over the Moon.|`|AA12332649	Interesting question Gallard<br>  <br>  It is most interesting because the only way international changes (according to the international law class I took last year), is when a country breaks it.  If we were to claim ownership of the moon or any part of it, the Senate by 2/3 vote would have to pass a reservation to the UN treaty, and this would have to be signed by the president.<br>  <br>  We have reservation to UN treaties right now, one of them is the Geneva convention on torture.<br>  <br>  Even if we had never been to the moon, we could still claim ownership, but we would have to colonize it and defend its borders.<br>  <br>  Once we have done this, our ownership would have to be recognized by other foreign nations in much the same way that we have recognized Kosovo when others have not.  Eventually, there would be universal recognition after a period of claim.<br>  <br>  Changing international law takes time, but yes, we could claim the moon, but I believe Kosovo would be recognized as a country before that happens.|`|W2HoVVDCaa	I believe there is an international law that everyone agrees to concerning outerspace.I read it not long ago but for the life of me cant remember the details of it.|`|niD66AbCaa	I think we should. Russia planted a flag at the bottom of the sea in the North Arctic and once the ice melts they get to claim all the oil under it. So we should get the moon.|`|mzNYfjQUaa	the us doesn't even own the us anymore. unless we pay china back 500 billion we can't say anything about owning|`|mIO4q7Nsaa	We could try, but would fail.  It doesn't belong to anyone, same as Antarctica.|`|99374ad96008c5bf2e201746e0432f9aaa	No.|`|aN7w8bwzaa	I would say so !
AA10065077	Well to answer your question a college degree is a very good tool. It will open doors for you. Because of your record I would suggest also doing a lot of community service and volunteer work. Also make sure that you don't be bad from now on.  This will show perspective employers that you learned from your mistakes and are willing to move on. Good luck to you and keep up the good work.|`|AA10925828	Having gone on to get your college degree, with your history, will definitely improve your life.  Getting a degree will improve life anyway, but since you have this history, going on to finish college will show that you are trying to improve yourself and contribute to society.  It will show that you are trying to make amends for the past and trying to improve yourself.<br>  <br>  There are places that will hire you.  The truth is you might find it hard to find that perfect job right after college, and will  have to start lower on the ladder, and then work your way up.  Reality is that it's the same way for a lot of people.  Once you get your foot in the door and prove yourself, you'll move up to more responsible positions.  You'll prove that the past is the past, and that you're never going to do those things again, and you will earn the higher positions and higher pay.  It won't be immediately, and it might not be easy at times, but if you are determined to show that you've bettered yourself, you can do it.  You might have to change your goals, since nursing might be out of the question, but there are other options.  Talk to a career counselor at your college to see what your criminal history will block, and set new goals.<br>  <br>  I know a guy that went through our county's drug court program after substance abuse arrests.  He finished the program, and is now working for the state department in the middle east.  He took his mistakes, learned from them, worked to get past them, and is now on his way to, well, the rest of his life.  Because he didn't make excuses for his past, owned up to his errors, and worked hard, the rest of his life is going to be great.  He could have said "screw it", I've made mistakes. I might as well give up."  If he had done that, life would be a lot harder.  Instead, he decided to improve himself, and in so doing, has proven himself.<br>  <br>  I wish you luck.  It might be difficult at times, but you can do it if you are determined to make life better.  |`|TtI7VtTfaa	Yes,<br>  <br>  but you'll never be able to be a nurse with a felony conviction.|`|wHrOKQrXaa	you have a lot on your plate it may take years before society will fully forgive you but because you due to have a baby soon the you need to establish your self with a support system to help you knock down those hurdles.and someone that is able to support and encourage you to keep on keeping on when life becomes really hard.

Obama.  <br>  <br>  And before you get all 'get a job and pay your own'.  I'm sixty, with a spotty medical history, we are retired and living on a pension,  too young for medicare and too rich for medicaid.<br>  And our insurance is $700 a month, although I can get a different policy for $140 but it only covers illnesses I get on a Thursday with an odd numbered date.<br>  So to answer your question, I'lll go with the younger guy, Bush had experience and he was the worst in my sixty years.  Especially in his second term, when he even had on-the-job experience.<br>  <br>  And as for choice of doctors, its a dream.  You go where they put you, whomever is on the list.  Just like now.

Environmentally you should discuss better ways to make each day more environmentally great...like ways to recycle and ect. Personally- should involve aspects of how you really want to live your life on a day to day basis. like... being more honest or in relation to others- or even simple to do lists of things you would want to do if you only had one day to live. Actively- should represent how you would like to be remembered. How would you like to be involved in your community and how you impact others.

e6104d6cfc6a57134c2deb916f0d67f4aa	Entre el "apoyemos la reforma petrolera" y "volver a reformar la ley" es necesario pasar por el saqueo a un recurso irrenovable propiedad de todos los mexicanos como nación y es la pobreza de México a la cual también alude "phanto..." por lógica de tiempos en nuestra geografía, ya que somos un país rico en petróleo hoy en el mundo entero. ?Así ha de ser siempre?<br>  <br>  Porque resulta que apoyamos un error,   luego darnos cuenta del mismo no será cosa de "reformar" y volver a la situación anterior, sólo nos daríamos cuenta con los síntomas de pobreza real en la economía nacional tiempo después una vez cuando sean irreversibles aquellos millones de dólares esfumados como petróleo que jamás volverá a ser de nadie, puesto que ya no existe nada de lo que perdimos. <br>  <br>  Por supuesto que privatizar conforme a como plantea la iniciativa de Calderón muy probablemente sería un negocio redondo. <br>  <br>  Porque tampoco se trata de mera ignorancia y negarse al consabido postulado empresarial que se necesita inversión para triunfar en los negocios, digo, quien invierte sabe que hay diferencias en cuanto a asociarse con ciertos inversionistas que permitir compartir capital a otros de menor confianza o mínima certidumbre. Son reglas que optimizan buenos negocios y modos de comercio eficaz que conocen los que saben hacer negocios redondos, por lo que es obvio que un empresario como Calderón ha contemplado cómo triunfar también aquí con el petróleo.<br>  <br>  El rollo es que también hay leyes para regular los negocios en sí, aparte de las normas internacionales de comercio, siendo la Constitución una de ellas y la más importante en el caso del petróleo ya que no por ser negocio redondo se le va a violar con la mano en la cintura, ?porque? <br>  <br>  Alguien así, sea el mismo presidente de México o quien pretenda con iniciativas de ley en el Senado que un bien de la nación mexicana se abra a otros beneficios ajenos al provecho del país de donde emana tal recurso soberano, estaría sujeto a responder en consecuencia.<br>  <br>  De ahí que los ciudadanos que se oponen a la reforma, asociación o privatización (como efectivamente es en el fondo la iniciativa de Calderón) deben ser tomados en cuenta si preguntan cosas tan sencillas como ?a quién y cómo beneficiarán en el negocio?, o disienten al hallar que la Constitución está siendo violentada desde los mismos términos de la propuesta.<br>  <br>  Nada más fácil que caer en cinismos o insultos para "chachalaquear", entrar al juego de la satanización reiterando que ese AMLO está loco y nadie lo sigue ya, pues descalifica oponerse a Calderón quien sí sabe de negocios y es darle plena razón con atribuciones de carta abierta, obligando a que aceptemos sin leer lo que dice la Constitución o la iniciativa en sí, pero igual asegurar que por un mesías ni vale la saliva de discutir con el pueblo aunque sea el propietario del bien petrolero, ni dar crédito a los expertos sino nada que más porque AMLO se opuso ya debe ser una iniciativa que apruebe en las Cámaras FAST TRACK. <br>  <br>  No puede ser una falacia el remedio al conflicto, plantando así de sencillo toda fin a la alaharaca con magias triunfalistas, pues el petróleo es un recurso de todos los mexicanos. Ojalá fuese menos complejo, pero no. Y el abuso que hagamos del petróleo o su mal uso, está determinado por la Constitución, con todas sus normas.<br>  En suma, no hay poder de nadie ni nada que esté por encima de la Constitución, pues esto se sanciona y máxime cuando no hablamos de un recurso exclusivo del presidente, ni de un partido o de dos o tres, ni siquiera de todos los empresarios, sacerdotes o investigadores de México, como tampoco es propiedad de la oposición.<br>  <br>  El petróleo es un recurso nacional, no porque lo diga Calderón, ni lo afirme AMLO. Sino porque está estipulado claramente en la Constitución. Sea ésta la vulgarmente llamada "mujer más violentada del país", o la tan reconcida "llave de nuestra vida democrática" o ambas, no por ello deja de ser la Carta Magna de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos, o sea, quien pretenda pasar por encima de cualquiera de sus artículos deberá ser sancionado.<br>  <br>  Nos advierte de inmediato algo delicado, pues si el que viola sus decretos en materia de soberanía nacional es el presidente de México, la sanción podría removerlo de su gestión y cargos, por tratarse no ya de ineptitud o triste ignorancia, sino contravenir con su autoridad un mandato que le obligó al jurarla como requisito y deber patriótico.<br>  <br>  A partir de las consecuencias, puede tomar altura una discusión que no sea pobre en argumentos, abrir paso a diálogos enriquecedores y la mejor solución en todas las aristas del problema petrolero, una por una. Dejar atrás mesianismos o ambicionismos y demás visiones ridículas. <br>  <br>  En lo personal, desde que ha habido voces inteligentes al respecto me sorprendió lo que dijera una de las opositoras, cuando anteriormente había tenido afinidad esa voz con Calderón y frecuentemente se alzaba en descrédito de AMLO. <br>  <br>  No es una voz equis ni desacreditada a la mala o bondadosa y automáticamente aceptada por ser heredera del general Cárdenas en la sangre, sino la de otro michoacano que fue gobernador en tierras purépechas y en el DF, quien brevemente  alertó hace dos semanas:<br>  <br>  "De aprobarse la iniciativa, se pondría en manos de intereses privados la refinación, el transporte por ductos, el almacenamiento y la distribución de hidrocarburos... <br>  "Sería una flagrante violación a la Constitución y peor, hacerlo como dice la iniciativa del presidente Calderón a través de contratos de maquila o de permisos, serviría para remachar la violación, pues no por llamar maquila a una conseción o permiso, dejaría de producirse un serio atropello a la norma constitucional."

Durante su mandato se creó lo que llamaron "Proyecto Suma" que no es otra cosa mas que lo que se envió al congreso para la reforma energética. aquí lo puedes ver y como observaras es del a?o 2006 antes de que Calderón asumiera el poder.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://oficiodepapel.com.mx/contenido/?p=188" rel="nofollow">http://oficiodepapel.com.mx/contenido/?p...</a><br>  <br>  La reforma energética únicamente beneficia a los intereses particulares como a sucedido con las anteriores privatizaciones como Telmex, los bancos, las autopistas etc. igualmente reformas como las afores y la ley del ISSSTE fueron echas para beneficiar a los bancos y intereses particulares.<br>  <br>  Trabaje 37 a?os en el Instituto Mexicano del Petróleo y me toco ver en 1a fila el desmantelamiento de la tecnología petrolera de los Mexicanos El IMP era líder en Latinoamerica en tecnología petrolera, llego a realizar proyectos en gran parte de los países Latinoamericanos, en lo personal me toco trabajar en proyectos en Argentina y Perú. Toda esa tecnología ha sido desmantelada poco a poco incluyendo la investigación en aguas profundas la cual se venia desarrollando desde el 2002. Nuestra tecnología incluso había llegado hasta Espa?a.<br>  <br>  Ahora con la nueva reforma se habla de construir dos refinerías para lo cual se invitará a las trasnacionales y extranjeras siendo que en el IMP ese trabajo lo realizamos con tecnología de punta por décadas con ahorros de miles de millones de dólares para el país.<br>  <br>  Se quejan de que Chávez quiere privatizar CEMEX, ?que pueden decir del desmantelamiento de nuestra propia tecnología en materia petrolera que traspaso fronteras y tenia reconocimiento internacional? lo peor es que fue llevada a cabo por nuestro propio gobierno.<br>  <br>  No nos hagamos a Pemex y al IMP se les ha dejado morir a propósito para tener la excusa de la reforma energética.<br>  <br>  Acaso los mexicanos valemos tan poca cosa como para no poder llevar a cabo el fortalecimiento de Pemex con nuestra propia tecnología? tenemos una UNAM y un IPN que han sacado técnicos de clase mundial y reconocidos por organismos internacionales. Es obvio que todo esta enfocado para que se enriquezcan mas los intereses de los EU.<br>  <br>  Aquí puedes ver como el IMP exportaba tecnología a otros países, en la actualidad es nula su presencia en México, Latinoamérica y en el mundo gracias a nuestro gobierno.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.invdes.com.mx/anteriores/Diciembre1998/htm/imp.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.invdes.com.mx/anteriores/Dici...</a>|`|otFHWfj1aa	Siiiiiiiiiiii, es verdad  se necesita una Reforma Energetica, para que los Fox inviertan, los Bibriescas, Mouri?o y toda su familia, calderon tambien debe invertir ?porque? ?no?, Y claro, que invierta Televisa tambien, y T.V.

It is NOT possible to record all of them.  Unless YOU were recording the call, it is unlikely you can find a recording even if one exists.|`|RRFbDou9aa	No.|`|a5Ko6DThaa	Funny question.  I will treat it like your serious though.  If your conversations are recorded then either you are under investigation by some law enforcement agency or intelligence agency and the investigators are not likely to expend effort for your convenience or someone is breaking the law and they are not likely to cooperate with you. <br>  For a third party to record your private phone conversations requires a warrant signed by a judge. Phone lines in businesses are sometimes recorded but you would have been notified if they were.  Private phone calls are protected so the only case where your in luck is if the FBI investigators recording your calls in compliance with a warrant happen to be very friendly and allow you to use their recordings.   But that's not something I would count on. |`|f3531b6f54158276ac57573d3f499ebdaa	They're monitored and recorded by the NSA, but they won't let you use their files.

You know that Telecommunications Act of 1996 may have came to view when news channels started playing unsenored suicides on thier news broadcast. There was a politician named Budd Dwyer that shot himself in the head in the 1980s during a news broadcast. Some of the news channels were showing it live, however, one news channel, owned by the Walt Disney company saved the recording of it and played it that evening while kids were probably watching it! I don't care for Disney anymore! Here's the links to prove it: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budd_Dwyer" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Budd_Dwyer</a>

Kerry was about to answer the student. <br>  <br>  Apparently the police are primed to react this way to anyone who seems confrontation or disagreeable. This is a real violation of free speech.<br>  <br>   I hope Kerry comes out publicly against it, and answers the student's questions.  I don't think the public is really aware of how often this goes on.<br>  <br>  Edit: When the cops grabbed the student's arms, Kerry said "That's alright, let me answer his question." He said a few more things that are not audible in the video. Perhaps he should have done more, but the police wrestled the student to the back of the auditorium and immediately started tasering him.  I'd like to hear Kerry's version of the story. But the issue is not whether Kerry should have done more, it's whether violent police action should be used to repress free speech.|`|1fhP1oddaa	tasering should be used in life treating or self defense only not just be calls a student is being  a ***.

What if you were one of the police officers trying to do your job and you had a ranting and raving lunitic trying to cause a commotion.  <br>  <br>  I personnaly felt that the students cheering when the cops finnally grabbed him were cheering because they were kicking the moron out.<br>  <br>  I think this situation should be looked at more towards following rules (of the forum) than freedom of speech.

There were plenty of cops.  <br>  <br>  America can NOT allow police to forgo effort and simply start tasering people when they have enough officers on the scene ... especially when the guy is down, handcuffed and begging!|`|usT4u294aa	I actually attended this event, and I would like to get out there what the several infamous YouTube videos fail to show. I had my eye on Meyer for a good amount of the time once questions were started, because I knew, from his reputation, that he was probably going to ask something quite interesting and out-there, and perhaps spark up some hot topics. Unfortunatly, he didn't seem to want to ask his "QUESTION" too badly, because he was pretty far back in line (but not actually at the end, as many would deem a good idea in his case). So, since this was a forum that only allowed a certain time for questions, (and yes, Kerry mentioned in the beginning that he would try his best to answer as many questions AS POSSIBLE in the time granted), the last question ended up going to a student on the other microphone, while everyone else who was waiting to ask a question was asked to please take a seat (while I agree it sucks that everyone couldn’t ask a question, these were the rules of the event). Meyer, who was not even the next student in line, refused to take a seat when asked, but instead INTERRUPTED the other student asking a question and went on to shout towards Kerry "You've been talking in circles for two hours and I’m about to be arrested.." and goes on about how everyone should have a chance to have their questions answered. Yes, that would be ideal, but its just not how this forum was set up. And at this point officers were just trying to have him sit down, not arrest him. Anyway, Kerry then said "Okay, I’ll let you ask your question when I’m done with this other gentleman" and so Meyer relaxed and waited, but obviously, when someone is getting that riled up in front of a U.S. Senator and an auditorium of people, the cops are going to have an eye on him. It was in these moments that Meyer was seen giving the video camera to the woman speaking here, so no doubt about it he was fully aware something was going to go down. At this point, there was only two cops by him, one a woman shorter than he is. Anyway, this is pretty much where the videos on YouTube pick up. Many people believe Meyers mic was cut due to his question on Skull and Bones, but in actuality, right when he said "b __lowjob," an official standing behind him gave the cue to cut the mic, and it just took a few second to actually have the mic turned off,  so he was able to get that last question about Skull and Bones in. Anyway, at this point, the two officers tried to escort him out, because he started to go a little ballistic when this happened and  then he began resisting and yelping. This was what called for more police to be brought in. They actually threatened him with mace, and that seems to be what caused him to start heading towards the exit with them. As he was being led up to the back of the auditorium to leave, he was yelling "HELP ME! IS ANYONE SEEING THIS?! WHAT DID I DO!"<br>  <br>  I would also like to try to clear up all this talk about how the audience and Kerry should have done something to help. Kerry actually told the police to let him go several times. Kerry wanted to answer Meyer's question, but when he was being escorted away, it was probably a better idea to just be calm and anwer the question to the remaining audience members. Seriosuly though, I can’t imagine anyone was fortelling what would happen next. It wasnt until Meyer was brought to the top of the auditorium that he began to really pull away and resist and was then brought to the floor in an attempt to handcuff him for restraint. He was resisting the police for quite some time while they were trying to handcuff him. There wasn’t really a reason for anyone to stop them.  It was then in the next few moments that you hear "Don't tase me, bro!" and a few people run up to the pile and yell to stop, after he had been tasered. I personally stood up and yelled “What the f _uck, don’t do that!” So, while I was totally appauled by him being tasered, there wasn't much we as audience members could do to stop it. Right after being tasered, he was taken out, so there really was not enough time for anyone to act. I personally couldn’t have done much alone besides just be pushed aside by the cops or possibly injured myself (and I know that seems like a small sacrifice for human rights, and it is, but it would have just been pointless by now), as I am a teenage girl with a small frame, and, as stated, there wasn’t enough time for most audience members to say “Hey, lets get together and throw these heavily-armed cops off this kid!” No one saw it coming and up until then, to be perfectly honest, it seemed appropriate for Meyer to be escorted out. He first broke a rule by jumping onto a microphone out of turn and then asked a chain of questions that turned into more of a rant and speech of his own. So it wasn’t the fact that he was rude or passionate about what he was saying, or even WHAT he was saying; it was that he  was turning the Q&A into a dialogue, and that’s not what it was. Then, however elementry it may seem, "b __lowjob" was inappropriate to say in the given situation. This was an organized event in which you needed a ticket to attend, so it was not just open for anybody to walk in randomly. These are the events that have guidlines that need to be followed to ensure the safety of the people (not that he himself was a treat at all) and the smoothness of the discussion.

You just have to tell them that you do...<br>  <br>  I hope you take him to the cleaners! *GRIN*<br>  <br>  ps: I agree with the previous poster. The girl probably just got sucked up into this mess.

I want to emphasize that I have no desire to hurt you, and that I was speaking from a place of sadness and anguish.  I know that you probably had no idea that I existed, let alone that the man you were seeing was married for 17 years.<br>  <br>  Please accept my sincerest apologies, and know that I mean you no harm of any kind.<br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  <br>  Wife<br>  <br>  <br>  ********<br>  <br>  The unfortunate thing here is that you have to apologize.  The fortunate thing is that it's impossible to enforce sincerity, so even though (I assume) you don't mean the apology, it's still there.<br>  <br>  If I can make a slightly-off-topic suggestion, though, I would suggest that you're probably more pissed off at your husband than the girl.  I hope this helps some.|`|qIwguye1aa	That is ground enough for me to be moving on but not without closing bank accounts, cashing out mutual funds, and post a no trespassing sign along with a photo of him on it.

They like to keep government small (Although recently, both sides seem to be making government bigger and bigger), a large military, and keep traditional values. Their defense of second-amendment rights is traditionally because an armed populace has that additional 'check/balance' against an oppressive government.<br>  <br>  Liberals are also often called progressives, the very opposite of conservatism. They are usually for income redistribution and have an anti-corporation attitude and are socially liberal, crusading for a change of values to 'get with the times' rather than stick with tried-and-true tradition.<br>  <br>  I would say I'm more economically conservative and socially liberal, which makes it hard for me to choose which is 'best'. However, given that conservatives (Especially George W. Bush) are drifting far away from economic conservatism, I tend to side with liberals due to their social policies (pro-choice, pro-gay rights, etc)|`|5nFAb6Qvaa	Both have noble missions. <br>  But, as the saying goes, "The devil is in the details".<br>  <br>  What everyone wants, for the most part, is pretty much the same thing. The exception being those who do not understand the history of our country and how we arrived at where we are today. They mistakenly believe by somehow interjecting concepts and political models which were debated by the framers of our current government and have been proven as impotent by world history, that they are somehow being 'progressive'.    <br>  <br>  Why must we keep dredging up faded concepts and the sun bleached bones of failed nations when we have before us the greatest model of government known through history?<br>  <br>  If an athlete, through great effort of discipline and exercise, manages to achieve some new record, then everyone readily acknowledges their mastery and skill.  Let that same athlete fail to maintain that discipline and exercise and their performance shall suffer greatly. Is it then true that we should say that the athlete has no skill, no mastery and does not deserve to stand on the field of competition? Or rather that the potential is there, merely waiting for discipline and exercise to once again be employed and so reveal the true heart of the champion?<br>  <br>  The strength of our American republic is suffering from apathy. A reformation is greatly needed. The model is good, the principles are sound. What is lacking is the discipline and exercise which are inherent to its success.  It is our job to ensure our Congress us void of excess and self-serving appetites.<br>  <br>  "We the people " are the fourth branch of our government. We may appear small, but it our eye that is to watch the compass and our hand that is to guide the rudder of the republic. Sadly, as we drift nearer and nearer to certain disaster, we have become blind, silent and stilled by the sureal songs of the Sirens.<br>  <br>  |`|AA10065077	Liberals want a large gov and conservatives want a small gov. Liberals are usually open to new ideas  and conservatives want more traditional values.|`|2L0tEgJtaa	Well, "noble" is up for interpretation.  Both parties will claim that distinction.  Being a conservative, I feel that the Republicans strive for that concept more consistently.  But apparently I am in the minority at the moment.  It's just too bad that it seems we are always forced to choose from the lesser of two evils in a Presidential election.  I sincerely think the current divisiveness among Americans is not the "hope and change" Democrats are talking about.

All of them were Republican.  MLK Jr was a republican.  Republicans freed the slaves and fought for civil rights while Democrats resisted ending slavery and bestowing on the blacks the same freedoms whites have.  Republicans pushed forward a bill (shot down by Democrats) to give each former slave 40 acres and a mule, thus ensuring him and his descendants wealth.  <br>  <br>  There are as many states that run republican that never had slaves as there are that have.|`|z1aTOyqSaa	They are the same states who resisted anti-slavery, black civil rights, and who are dominated by the church. <br>  Classic republicans.|`|c13jouzSaa	OK FIRST OF ALL WE ARE SO NOT RACIST!

" Our plan is to promote ugliness, repulsive, meaningless art".<br>  24) Eliminate all laws governing obscenity by calling them "censorship" and a violation of free speech and free press.<br>  25) Break down cultural standards of morality by promoting pornography, and obscenity in books, magazines, motion pictures, radio and TV.<br>  26) Present Homosexuality, degeneracy, and promiscuity as "normal, natural, and healthy".<br>  27) Infiltrate the churches and replace revealed religion with "social" religion. Discredit the Bible and emphasize the need for intellectual maturity, which does not need a "religious crutch"<br>  28) Eliminate prayer or any phase of religious expression in the schools on the grounds that it violates the principle of "separation of church and state"<br>  29) Discredit the American Constitution by calling it inadequate, old fashioned, out of step with modern needs, a hindrance to cooperation between nations on a worldwide basis.<br>  30) Discredit the American founding fathers. Present them as selfish aristocrats who had no concern for the "common man".<br>  31) Belittle all forms of American culture and discourage the teaching of American history on the ground that it was only a minor part of "the big picture:" Give more emphasis to Russian history since the Communists took over.<br>  32) Support any socialist movement to give centralized control over any part of the culture - - education, social agencies, welfare programs, mental health clinics, etc.<br>  33) Eliminate all laws or procedures, which interfere with the operation of the Communist apparatus.<br>  34) Eliminate the House Committee on Un-American Activities.<br>  35) Discredit and eventually dismantle the FBI<br>  36) Infiltrate and gain control of more unions.<br>  37) Infiltrate and gain control of big business<br>  38) Transfer some of the powers of arrest from the police to social agencies. Treat all behavioral problems as psychiatric disorders which no one but psychiatrists can understand or treat.<br>  39) Dominate the psychiatric profession and use mental health laws as a means of gaining coercive control over those who oppose Communist goals.<br>  40) Discredit the family as an institution. Encourage promiscuity and easy divorce.<br>  41) Emphasize the need to raise children away from the negative influence of parents. Attribute prejudices, mental blocks and retarding of children to suppressive influence of parents.<br>  42) Create the impression that violence and insurrection are legitimate aspects of the American tradition; that students and special interest groups should rise up and make a "united force" to solve economic, political, or social problems.<br>  43) Overthrow all colonial governments before native populations are ready for self-government.<br>  44) Internationalize the Panama Canal.<br>  45) Repeal the Connally Reservation so the US can not prevent the World Court from seizing jurisdiction over domestic problems. Give the World Court jurisdiction over domestic problems. Give the World Court jurisdiction over nations and individuals alike. <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  Check <a href="http://www.glennbeck.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.glennbeck.com</a> for more|`|lse7ZjIUaa	I'm a conservative and I don't feel that way at all..|`|prisCQ8Haa	Thank you for showing us your one sided liberal thoughts.

Lamb<br>  <br>  Sen. Obama's autobiography is filled with "composite" characters, rearranged timelines, and fantasy events that never occurred. I read that twice in the Washington Post - read Richard Cohen's columns of Jan. 1, 2008, and March 27, 2007, for yourself.<br>  <br>  There are more articles than that, by more authors than just Mr. Cohen, but I wanted to get started by saying that what follows isn't just something I'm pulling out of thin air. What follows is serious, documented, and not at all what those who want to write history about the election of the first so-called "African-American" president, want in the least to admit is true - and why its truth matters more than their desire to ignore the truth for the sake of their desire to write history.<br>  <br>  While his shrill wife objects, the truth is that Sen. Obama's life, as he wrote about himself in his autobiography, is, in fact, nothing but a fairy tale. Again, don't take my word for it - read Mr. Cohen's, and others, articles about it.<br>  <br>  If what Mr. Cohen writes are truths, then what Mr. Obama wrote are lies. It's just as simple as that.<br>  <br>  Yet there is not one word from the "Last Bastions of Accuracy" that comprise our first-tier information enterprises about the complete lack of integrity Sen. Obama shows with his fictional life history. He lies, but his lies are swept under the rug by a groupthink mentality that is so desperate to regain leadership positions - as opposed to actual leadership programs to earn those leadership positions - that it ignores the truth that Sen. Obama lies - about himself, about his life, about his actions - and even about his racial composition.<br>  <br>  I researched what follows for a NY daily of international reputation. It wasn't what I thought I'd find. I documented it, presented it to the Washington Bureau Chief, but was hardly surprised that it never saw ink. As you'll see for yourself, this is the political equivalent of a nuclear bomb.<br>  <br>  I must pause very briefly to note usage of the word ***** in what follows: In all academic studies of race, the proper scientific word for the ethnic composition I discuss is *****. For any who scream racist at its mention, I say take it up with the scientific community. It's not my word, it's theirs. I am using it in its proper scientific context.<br>  <br>  Why is the fact that Mr. Obama is only 6.25% African ***** not reported?<br>  <br>  Because to acknowledge it is to report this devastating truth about him: Mr. Obama is not legally African-American. It is impossible for him to be, in truth, America's first African-American president.<br>  <br>  Federal law requires that to claim a minority status, you must be at least 1/8 of the descriptor, but for the sake of this article, I've converted it to a decimal fraction for easier comprehension. You must be at least 12.5% of the racial component you claim for minority status. Mr. Obama, claiming to be African-American, is half the legal threshold.<br>  <br>  Again, to let it sink in: Mr. Obama is not legally African-American. It is impossible for him to be, in truth, America's first African-American president.<br>  <br>  Yet claiming to be African-American is the soul and substance of his claim to fame. It is what he has used throughout his adult life to distinguish himself from other competitors. It is the ethnic identity he proclaims, and it is the ethnic identity he craves. Without it, he is just another mixed race Caucasian Arab with an African influence playing on his skin’s pigmentation.<br>  <br>  But no matter what he craves, no matter what he has used to propel himself through life, no matter the racist presumption of seeing his skin and without question calling him black, the hard, cold, genetically inarguable reality remains: he is not an African-American.<br>  <br>  Mr. Obama is 50% Caucasian, that from his mother. What those who want Mr. Obama to write history by becoming "America's first African-American president" ignore is that his father was ethnically Arabic, with only 1 relative ethnically African ***** - a maternal great-grandparent (Sen. Obama's great-great grandparent, thus the 6.25% ethnic contribution to the senator's ethnic composition.).<br>  <br>  That means that Mr. Obama is 50% Caucasian from his mother's side. He is 43.75% Arabic, and 6.25% African ***** from his father's side.<br>  <br>  Put another way, his father could honestly claim African-American ethnic classification. He was the last generation able to do so.<br>  <br>  Sen. Obama could honestly say, "My father was African-American." Racist presumptions led an Ivy League admissions committee, and lazy "newspapers of record" factcheckers, to presume that if his father is African-American, then Sen. Obama must be African-American also.<br>  <br>  But it doesn't work that way. Racist presumptions coupled with sloppy vetting don't turn a lie into the truth.<br>  <br>  Sen. Obama is one generation too far removed from the ethnic African ***** input to make the same claim as his father, Harvard's Admission's stamp of approval notwithstanding.<br>  <br>  As you can see for yourself, Sen. Obama's African-American ethnic claim, when properly researched and documented, is a lie.<br>  <br>  The question no one wants to answer - particularly Mr. Obama and his supporters, is, "Why do you think he has an Arabic name? Why does his father have an Arabic name? Why does every ancestor on his father's side have an Arabic name?"<br>  <br>  The answer is obvious: They have Arabic names because his father's side of the family tree is Arabic.<br>  <br>  Need proof? Research the Kenyan records for yourself. You will find that his father was officially classified as "Arab African" by the Kenyan government.<br>  <br>  But in America's current political climate, that truth is heresy; that truth is "an inconvenient truth." It is the political equivalent in our time to what Galileo's scientific pronouncements were in his time: it is true, but nobody wants to know the truth because the lie is so much more comforting.<br>  <br>  That is why detractors of this truth will do everything to denounce it, except submit to the discipline of actually researching it.<br>  <br>  There's a reason for that: it proves he is not sufficiently ***** to earn classification under American law as an African-American.<br>  <br>  For Sen. Obama, telling the truth means he will give up all the accolades about being the first African-American president of the Harvard Law Review, an accolade that relies on a sleight-of-hand in job titling that changed the name of the top job from Editor to President.<br>  <br>  If stated in its absolute truth, Mr. Obama was the second person of color to run the Review. He was beat to the Review's top spot by a true African-American about 60 years before Mr. Obama showed up for classes.<br>  <br>  Again, a very inconvenient truth.<br>  <br>  That is devastating in itself. The further effect is that Mr. Obama would have to convince Americans still reeling from 9/11, Afghanistan, and Iraq, that now is the time for America's first Arab-American president.<br>  <br>  We all know what chance that has of succeeding.<br>  <br>  Of course, that would only happen if Mr. Obama told the truth about his racial composition. To tell the truth means Mr. Obama will have to admit that which he has never been forced to admit before, even in the face of the massive lies of his autobiography: Mr. Obama's entire projection of who he is, and what he is, is a lie.<br>  <br>  Mr. Obama would have to say to the world: "I am not what I've told you I am. I lied to you in my autobiography when I told you I am black. I lied to the Admission Committee at Harvard so I could get in. I lied to my constituents in Chicago so I could get elected to the State Senate. I lied to my constituents in Illinois so I could get elected to the US Senate. I lied to my supporters across America so I could be President.<br>  <br>  "I have lied all during my life to play the race card, and use it, cynically, to advance myself by playing upon the racist presumption of Americans to accept, without question, that anyone of color is African-American. I lied to you, and you blindly accepted it, because of your own racist presumptions about color, and ethnic identity. I looked African-American, and your racist presumptions told you to believe it."<br>  <br>  Even as you read this, the overwhelming majority of you will continue to believe it. Even as you know the truth, you will block the truth out of your mind, because you are bred to accept the racist presumption of color, and ethnic identity.<br>  <br>  And so many of you reading this will create incredible mental gymnastics, telling yourself why the truth doesn't matter. You will lie to yourself because you want to believe the lie, and then curse the American body politic for being built on lies.<br>  <br>  You will do this all while failing to tell yourself the truth that it is your lies, as much as any other lies, that are killing the body. You will commit the very action that you curse as the cause of America's demise, because you are jaded beyond recognizing in yourself the very same disease you so freely condemn in others.<br>  <br>  Here is the truth about Mr. Obama's name, and his father's ancestors:<br>  <br>  True ***** tribal members of western Kenya where his father was born have Christian names, not Arabic. His father's decision to name him with an Arabic name is a matter of his father establishing his ethnic identity in Africa - it is done deliberately to separate him from the African tribes. He may live among them, but he is not one of them. His father's message is that he is Arabic, not *****.<br>  <br>  Many will find these truths unsettling. I'm often asked, "But I thought his father was Kenyan. How could Mr. Obama not be African-American, how could his |`|rGFf3ufdaa	What?...........

GiCRQG7Maa	Only estimates exist, but it is believed that at least 250 million children work for a living in developing countries, nearly half of them full time. At least 60 million children worldwide are exploited under extreme forms of child labour such as debt bondage and prostitution. Child labour is a human rights violation on many different levels<br>  Children work long hours, often exposed to hazardous chemicals and made to use dangerous tools and machinery that are inappropriate to their mental and physical development. <br>  <br>  Its so widespread. Child labour in agriculture is not just in the developing world; it even exists in the United States and Europe. In most countries children assist their families in small scale fishing, family farms and subsistence agriculture. Girls are often kept away from school to work as domestics. <br>  <br>  Because it's often hidden or invisible. This is the case of domestics working outside their own home. The children - almost always girls - work very long hours, have no chance to go to school, and are isolated from family and friends. Often they are treated like slaves and sexually and physically abused. Many girls living in agricultural communities drop out of school to work as domestics in their villages or the nearby towns. <br>  <br>  Some children are forced to work in debt-bondage. In return for a money advance or credit, a person offers their labour, or that of a child, for an indefinite period. Sometimes only the child is pledged, becoming a commodity in the process. This form of slavery can continue through generations. This happens a lot in agricultural communities.|`|Lgl7BbN3aa	because when children are working the wont be getting as good of an education. they will also be taken advantage of and underpaid and have bad working conditions. if it wasnt illegal it would be abused like it was before it was a law.|`|rMV6yMu4aa	because the childs body is not mature yet|`|tIdXa0zKaa	Points:<br>  a. Every child is future citizen in the making.  If his/her progress is thwarted or geopardised by work for earnings his studies and other progressive parameters and mental abilities will be thwarted.<br>  b. Conventionally poor families viewed their many children as a source of income, including selling them away.<br>  c.  If the child is protected from exploitation the future Nation is strongly built on solid foundations.<br>  d. Child abuse is an unintended outcome of child labour which at times shakes the social conscience.<br>  e. It is the legal and moral duty of parents and Govt and society to protect the child from exploitation for personal gain and extend everything to them as a matter of right.<br>  f.  The existing child protection laws are to be fortified and stgrengthened and constitutional rights are to be created and all the alws are to be strictly implemented with heaviest penalties for violation.<br>  g.  child is the future of the Nation not that of mere belonging to  parents. <br>  h. Every child is to be respectfully welcomed into this society, affectionately treated and carefully protected and meticulously shaped to grow.<br>  i.

523ef0fae6b39bfc436fe3f0a0e61d80aa	Plagiarizing is just as bad as cheating, both of which are considered academic dishonesty. The punishment can range from the least, a zero on the assignment and a call home, to the most, like a detention and/or suspension. Most colleges will throw you out of their classes for plagiarism, so if you do use a source with information you really want to use, make sure you cite it. Most teachers use the MLA format. This website should help.

DTSUJe2oaa	If your record is sealed then an employer cannot access it period, that is the purpose of having it sealed, a sealed record is different from an expunged record in the sense that an expunged record is gone as though it never happened where as a sealed record is just that it still exists but it is sealed to everyone except law enforcement and a court will not give a prospective employer access to it.~|`|AA10065077	The employer could see the arrest report only with a court order. Yes, I got a job with a sealed misdemeamor because I was under 18 at the time it happened. 
ridu0Rtwaa	They obviously had a warrant!!<br>  <br>  The only thing to do is come clean and volunteer to tell the truth.  That would get it over quickly and save all the heart ache of investigation and trial.<br>  <br>  No sympathy here for someone under investigation for a crime - innocent until pr oven guilty but you have the ability to step forward and give evidence to the investigators before trial!!|`|qIwguye1aa	what?  The police must of had a warrant with them it describes the items to look for and where they are.  WOW!!  I hope you don't have what they are looking for some kind of criminal activity.  Because if they find it they will hall you off to jail.  Don't go asking for your things without an attorney and it sounds like you need a criminal one fast!!!|`|QQsIPlV2aa	The DA's raided your house!??? I hope they had a warrant with them, and gave you a reason why!! Why not send the Police over? I don't know what this is all about, but it had to be connected to a criminal case! I would go to the DA's office, and tell them you want your stuff back if they have finished with them! If they have "mucked" them up, destroyed them or damaged them, make them pay for them!|`|AA10065077	Why did they take your stuff? Were you involved in any criminal case or did someone mention your name? If you want your stuff back contact an attorney. I suggest having a criminal attorney on hand anyway. Chances are they are looking at something for illegal activity and next might be arresting you. Thanks to the patriot act they don't need search warents for the stuff they took. Good luck to you.|`|y0jL9n6Taa	Have you tried asking for it back?  If they said no then you need a lawyer.  Not to get your stuff back but to defend you when they finally indict you.  What did you do?|`|0i4opGVSaa	Ask a lawyer to request the return of the item.<br>  <br>  At that point, they will be forced to drop the case or press charge.|`|AA10480074	it must have been a slow day at the office, if you say that a bunch of DA's raided your house what they do give the police or FBI a day off so how many district attorney's where there 4,5,or 6 or more what they do drive up in black SUV's comming running up to your front door and kick it in and yelled "DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S WE HAVE A WARRANT TO SEARCH AND SEIZE YOUR BELONGINGS".<br>  <br>  now here are the facts (district attorney's) do not i repeat do not raid peoples house's if that person's house has been under survalance for let's say 3 to 6 months and they also do not hand out warrants (that process is handed out by a judge) who then hands it to the D.A and the D.A hands it over either to the police or the Federal Burial of Invesgation (FBI).<br>  <br>  You say that it has been six months since they took your laptop and your phones and your digital camera and the reason that you weren't convicted is that they are still in the process of investagating your equipment, on your lap top the tech. will search the hard drive for any illicit photos, (that you may have taken with your digital camera and up loaded on to your lap top) and your phones i assume that they're cell phones with a built in camera oh and don't bother deleting any illicit pictures they can bring the photos back up.<br>  <br>  So lets hope and pray that everything comes up nice and clean and the only pictures is the one of your grandmother's 80th birthday party or you Aunt and Uncle's 50th wedding ann. 
UxvjnjRLaa	People have missed the mark. Remember when Obama said he was going to use the Presidential fund so as to abide by one of the best campaign finance reforms in 35 years. Then at the last minute he broke his promise and became the first candidate since Nixon and McGovern to fund himself unregulated and unfettered. Mr McCain kept his word even though he knew he could raise more on his own because he felt it was the most ethical way. Mr Obama has no ethics, look how he won his first seat in Illinois he had everyone else thrown off the ballot. Also all those small contributions many have fictitious names so where is the money coming from. People say spend wiser but McCain only allowed 85 Million. Barrak is a man of broken promises and contrary statements the hallmark of Tyrants. He states he will repeal all the Bush tax cuts. That will cost the average Joe $2500 or more a year. He says McCain is not going to help the middle class with any tax breaks, then promises 3 times as much. Three time 0 is 0 and three times a negative is a larger tax increase. He says he will put America back to work building more roads so we can burn even more foreign oil. Why doesn't he rebuild America by finding way to burn less fuel. Once again he only knows how to treat the symptoms this is the hallmark of a politician, remember he is a Chicago Machine Politician and look what great shape the state of Illinois is in. His buddy fellow Chicago Politician Blajovich has about bankrupted the state pension fund. Mr Obama has promised over a trillion dollars in new spending that is almost $4000 per US citizen so a family household of 4.3 can expect $17200 to be spent on his behalf treating symptoms not solving problems. He is buying this election in more than one way one with questionable contributions funding via the old school corruption riddled way instead of a tried and better way were both sides get the same amount, and with your paycheck. Can we afford more Chicago type spending on our dwindling paychecks? Last I ask all those who have tax programs for the 2000 tax year to calculate their last years taxes with them and compared to what they paid. If you are like me you will find the 2000 taxes would have cost you a lot more and this is one promise Mr. Obama is likely to keep to roll back taxes on the Average Joe to where they were under Clinton. The nice thing is there is no way either party can change that tax check so you know it will be free of bias.<br>  |`|yiJ5dXbPaa	Well, I only watched the first debate on Fox and half of the second debate (I had a class), but I will tell you that Obama's "terrific" campaign is pissing me off.  There are too many people that just do not understand the reasons he should never be president.  Welfare sharing, with no less than 95% is bologni, with about 33% of people that do not pay or have to pay taxes. I am from Texas; I will tell you that many of the "illegal aliens" are not working, and the rate of taxpayers is decreasing.  Obama is not only buying this election with thousands of dumbasses (excuse my sailor words), but undemocratic is the incorrect term.  You meant he is being "uncommon!"|`|BWdUzaxqaa	Nope, if you republicans hadn't made such bad decisions, you would have had alot more money on hand.  You could have picked Romney and had the considerable resources of the LDS church, did you?  No.  Could have picked Huckabee, and brought along every church in the south and midwest.  a virtual cash-cow.  Did you?  No.  You picked a nobody with limitied political experience that no one is willing to back because not only do they not want to associate with trailer-trash, and they are not pulling out wads of cash for a couple of undependable mavericky politicians that are sure to lose.|`|1l7CiLKPaa	Absolutely!<br>  <br>  We are seeing proof of it everyday.<br>  <br>  The media is bought and all his supporters are bought.<br>  <br>  The man has lied, cheated, and stole from the American People.<br>  <br>  The man has no honor or respect for America or its people.<br>  <br>  McCain & Palin "08"<br>  True Americans for the American people|`|r0LHAH5Yaa	Sure is, and yes hun that sure is undemocratic. It's like something they do in communist countries, and that's what will happen if that sick man is elected, he will turn this nation into a communist state and take away our freedoms, take away our right to own a gun, take away all of our freedoms. |`|hGH5yFj8aa	What , there is a new law now? Only Republicans can spend money on elections? The reason that you hear mostly positive about Obama is because this time the Republican's candidate is such a disaster that I think most would be embarassed to support him.<br>  |`|XMIcUdk8aa	It sure looks that way.<br>  <br>  He will eventually hang himself.<br>  <br>  I'm looking forward to the day he is arrested and justice is served, that's if he dont buy them off too or his terrorist friends dont kill us first.<br>  <br>  McCain and Palin<br>  |`|dscGzJSSaa	yes and no simultaneously.<br>  <br>  what are you so scared about? your on yahoo answers not watching the news!|`|aYjbu2ueaa	no.|`|SlhuFfuZaa	Ever notice that every modern president has been well off, if not already rich. The political machine spends millions every election, irregardless of the economy and most of the money buys the media so they will  tell the masses who to vote for. People seldom vote on issues, they vote on media hype.  <br>  We need change, but not the Obama change. We need free elections where the media, like churches are not allowed to state a preference and only report the news not make it.<br>  AMERICA, first and foremost!|`|ff4620d7ef5c56f9405c2f52615552f5aa	No, but his families (Bush & Cheney) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjwgkCZFP5U" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjwgkCZFP...</a><br>   friends own and control the mainstream media. The Bilderberg Group and other organizations like the CFR and TriLateral Commission choose who they want as their puppet front-man spokesperson, and that's who they have the media hype up.|`|7ONKVbbiaa	I think you didn't get the memo. <br>  <br>  MOST of his money has been sent to him from individual donors under 200 bucks. Thus, it is the American public who is doing the buying.  He chose  not to take tax dollars. <br>  I have never donated to any candidate before now. <br>  Undemocratic would be him paying ME to vote. |`|VBHOiIBlaa	that and 90% of the media is telling everything good about Obama, you never hear any negatives. . .<br>  <br>  Ask an Obama Supporter to name 3 things Obama has done wrong ....<br>  <br>  Just proved my point|`|QgD4Cbb7aa	Yes.Obama has his own channel on the Dish Network 24/7 where's McCain channel?|`|lgkAnUllaa	in a way but what would be the point of campaign contributions if you didn't use them effectively?|`|jkKAMm1Naa	No. In fact, his fundraising is the most democratic fundraising ever accomplished in history. <br>  <br>  The average Obama donation is something like $80. More than 3 million regular people have donated to his campaign. Ive donated about $300 total, usually in small donations of $25 when I have the money.<br>  <br>  Every election season, the candidates buy the election in their own way. Usually they are doing it MOSTLY with money from wealthy powerful donors. Obama is MOSTLY doing it with the money of regular people like me.<br>  <br>  It's an amazing feat that most people didnt think could be done. But that is the thing about Obama. He is brilliant. He surrounds himself with smart people who know how to get things done. And he is accomplishing so many things in his campaign that are simply unprecedented. This is why I am voting for him. I have no reason to believe he will be any less amazing in the White House|`|angW1Lkfaa	With the people funding his campaign it would appear that people want him to represent them. If anyone is buying this election it's the people.I'm tried of getting screwed aren't you?  What's undemocratic? doesn't Republicans use money from the rich and big business to fund them, What's the difference?|`|d6VyFGo3aa	He is spending enough money to buy Wall Street.  If he has it then why shouldn't he spend it any way he wishes? The Dems are all fired up and are willing to give him millions for his campaign. I only hope that it works out well for the nation after he is elected.  He is a slick B.S. artist and I hope that his B.S. turns out to be really good for the nation rather than merely more smelly stuff from Washington.  I just do not trust politicians regardless of who they might be. |`|rsgzqeucaa	if thats what it takes... thats the beauty of being in America... you have a bunch of freedoms.<br>  <br>  Three things obama has done wrong:<br>  - challenge McCain to take voter financing... and he didn't<br>  - not take up John McCain's offer on town hall debates<br>  - Make a reference with putting lipstick on a pig...lol<br>  <br>  it's NOT wrong to find something wrong with you're candidate... You can still support them though|`|CSyA2n5iaa	No, he is just spending wisely.  The fact that he raised all of that money speaks very highly of how excited his supporters are.  Myself included.<br>  <br>  Obama/Biden|`|AA10065077	If he is so what? Every elected offical has some skeltons about campaign doners. Obama just gets good press all the time. Nothing wrong with that. Just remember the higher they fly the harder they fall. |`|v5VlL09iaa	Free Market Economy<br>  No Oversight<br>  Just Get Out Of My Way Government|`|HlLWt74maa	Why, you wanna see a receipt?

Which most people learned in high school.|`|g2idZEKFaa	I wouldn't doubt it<br>  .<br>  That is a Republican way of thinking <br>  .<br>  That is how America got into the situation that it and the world with it are in today<br>  .<br>  And America is the bad guy in this movie of the world <br>  .<br>  Who made things go for broke <br>  .|`|AA10065077	As VP Gov Palin would be the ex officio President of the Senate and can only vote to break a tie. By convention, however, the Vice President presides over very few Senate debates, attending only on important ceremonial occasions (such as the swearing-in of new senators) or at times when his vote may be needed to break a tie vote. The Constitution authorizes the Senate to elect a President pro tempore (Latin for "president for a time") to preside in the Vice President's absence; the most senior senator of the majority party is customarily chosen to serve in this position. Like the Vice President, the President pro tempore does not normally preside over the Senate, but typically delegates the responsibility of presiding to junior senators of the majority party. Frequently, freshmen senators (newly elected members) are allowed to preside so that they may become accustomed to the rules and procedures of the body.<br>  <br>  The presiding officer sits in a chair in the front of the Senate chamber. The powers of the presiding officer of the Senate are far less extensive than those of the Speaker of the House. The presiding officer calls on Senators to speak (by the rules of the Senate, the first Senator who rises is recognized); ruling on points of order (objections by Senators that a rule has been breached, subject to appeal to the whole chamber); and announcing the results of votes.<br>  So, I wouldn't worry about Palin messing things up.<br>  |`|tg0wOdIcaa	well first of all she awta be given the death penalty just for every breath she takes cuz shes a waste of DNA  and it definantly would screw the heck outta this country palin should be bailin'|`|21LL6pPBaa	She wouldn't even know where to start.

That's just two houses less than McCain has, and we were far from wealthy.<br>  Did you ever consider how much property John Kerry and his wife had in their possession while he was running for President?  Probably not, because I'm sure you are as bias and short-sighted as the rest of your kind.  |`|zn0pXkc0aa	Not so much a question here as you have already decided the answer before reading community input.<br>  <br>  McCain is well prepared for the White House after giving over 50 years of public service to our country as a Naval Aviator, a Congressman and Senator.<br>  <br>  What has Obama done? Propose redistribution of wealth, increase taxes, and plan a million dollar soire to celebrate his presidential victory. Of course this is planned when our country is facing hard times.<br>  <br>  Obama also has attended a church for over 20 years where the Rev. Wright preached anti-American statements.<br>  <br>  Now who do you think is right for the White House? <br>  <br>  Someone who has served our country as a true patriot: McCain.|`|lGdzb8aqaa	hell naw |`|f7KKrMJvaa	Change what??<br>  <br>  You libs talk about change but you don't even know what the heck it is or what obumma is all about!!<br>  <br>  What happened to people who believed in themselves?<br>  <br>  Now everyone just wants a free handout.|`|SjfC29fmaa	I TOTALLY AGREE! *OBAMA 08*|`|5kJDDgDcaa	No. I agree.|`|tnkp8n2Zaa	 no republican is right for office right now, we saw what they do when they have control, 911 was bad but this is a disaster and the only reason palin was chosen  is for alaskas oil and natural gas otherwise she and the party is the worlds biggest joke of the year. <br>  they only care about winning and the rest of the country is just trying to keep this country alive.<br>  Watch the news (not fox) u stupid r-wingers and see what you have been supporting.

I finally figured out what the Republicans were talking about.  I figured out what Obama is going to do to hurt white people like me if he gets elected.  He's going to paint the White House black.  He'll probably also change the flag to make the white stripes black.  I'm really going to change my mind and vote for McCain if they tell me that he's going to make the stars on the flag black also, because I don't think black stars look good on a blue background.|`|F88SB9Duaa	Yes, you pick up a paintbrush, dip it in paint, and then you move it across the outside walls of the White House.

Obama stated healthcare is a right. McCain stated healthcare was a responsibility. With the attitude and selfishness of many people, no one will take on the responsibility.  For example, if a person becomes very ill and can't work what are they going to do? Put yourself in that position. Would you want people to turn their backs on you and say "Its not my problem- your not MY responsibility!"......... Obama is right to say it is a right<br>  <br>  Several credible republicans have endorsed Obama as they see their party has become way too corrupt and they trust that Obama will work across the table for the betterment of the county. <br>  <br>  All smear tactics were proven to be incorrect.  Obama has been heavily criticized but has shown instead his strength, poise, intelligence and conduct appropriately.  <br>  <br>  He's not owned by lobbyists<br>  <br>  If I earned even $100K a year I would be happy to pay a 3% tax increase - no problem- its to put American back on her feet.  Obama would be taxing people who make $250K a year only 3% tax.  <br>  <br>  I don't believe anyone has a right to tell me what I can and cannot do with my own body.  I have kids and never had an abortion because I wasn't put in that position.  My 13 y/o daughter was though- she was brutally raped!  I thought about about abortion if she got pregnant.  Thank God for the day after pill!

Reruns of the show are often played to this date.  There was one episode in particular that is very appropriate for this presidential election.  It was about aliens who came to earth assuring mankind that they meant them no harm and that the planet they came from was a utopia.  <br>  <br>  These aliens came bearing a book in a language no human could understand.  They correctly told mankind the title of the book was How to Serve Man and the people of earth automatically assumed the aliens benevolently wanted to take care of them.  Mankind lined up to board their aircraft to go to their planet to visit utopia.  Eventually the linguist deciphered the alien’s language and found that How to Serve Man was a cookbook – too late for millions who already left earth for the Promised Land.  <br>  <br>  Unlike the majority of Obama supporters who know next to nothing about his beliefs beyond what he reads off a teleprompter, I’ve thoroughly researched Obama’s background, from childhood to present day.  I also researched that of his parents and the associates he chose to ally himself.  How is it most Americans can go through their entire lives and meet few if any criminals, communists, terrorists, racists, corrupt politicians, bigots, and gangsters, yet Obama associations read like a who’s who of the underworld.  If nothing else, surely that should give you pause, and if that doesn’t his track record should.  As a Community Organizer Obama was a failure and as a State Senator abysmal.  Here's an enlightening article about Obama’s track record as a State Senator from the left leaning Boston Globe.  This article goes to the core of Obama’s honesty, trust and compassion as a human being.  <br>  <br>  'Grim Proving Ground of Obama's Housing Policy'<br>  <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/ar...ousing_policy/" rel="nofollow">http://www.boston.com/news/nation/ar...o...</a>  <br>  <br>  It's a 9 page expose on Obama's record as a corrupt state senator who couldn't manage to get his constituents heat in the Resko and Jarret owned slums during a Chicago winter yet managed to enrich himself and his criminal and communist pals at their expense by obtaining earmarks for himself and these goons.  If Obama didn't give a damn or show a fig of compassion about the poor people living in those squalid slums (and these are the same black inner city poor Obama claims so much to care about) then what makes you and the rest of his supporters think he's going to have compassion for anyone else.  It's amazing that so many black Americans are voting for this man simply because they think if he’s black he'll be more willing to look after their interests.  But, the facts don't support that assumption, and the opposite is actually true - Obama left his constituents much worse off then before he became their State Senator and was completely inured to their suffering.  <br>   <br>  Another article highlighting Obama's lack of compassion for his fellow man happens to be the case of his own half-brother; a brother he thought enough of to exploit in his book Dreams of My Father.  In his book Obama describes his half-brother as a beautiful boy with a perfectly round head.  Obama's brother lives on less than twelve dollars a year, in a squatter's shack with no sanitation facilities or fresh running water.  To say animals at the Bronx zoo live a much better existence is a gross understatement.  Yet Obama, a multimillionaire, doesn't even have enough compassion to give his brother a stinking $120.00 a year.  That's just 9 dollars more a month. 9 dollars which can alleviate the suffering of a brother he described so beautifully in his book.  If Obama doesn't even have enough compassion for the horrible plight of his brother what could possibly make you and his supporters think that he would give a damn about you and their plight, no matter how much he says to the contrary.  It’s ironic, though, how he’s already planning his victory party complete with champagne and caviar while his constituents are still enslaved in their horrible existence living in their dilapidated public housing on their monthly food stamp handouts -so much for Obama’s empty promise of hope and change.  They certainly didn’t get any hope, and any change they got was for the worse – a lot worse.<br>  <br>  Help Obama's Half-Brother Move Out of his Hut<br>  <a href="http://townhall.com/Columnists/DineshDSouza/2008/09/08/help_obamas_half-brother_move_out_of_his_hut" rel="nofollow">http://townhall.com/Columnists/DineshDSo...</a>  <br>  <br>  Obama's ideology is already showing itself in horrifying Orwellian ways.  Obama TV on Satellite; glassy-eyed children singing his praise in scenes reminiscent of North Korea and National Socialist Germany; teenage boys chanting “Obama is the Alpha & Omega” while dressed in army fatigues (I guess that is the start of Obama’s future Civilian National Army he said he’d impose if he became president - the future brown shirts of America); video games for children with subliminal messages and images of Obama popping up; truth squads where people are threatened with lawsuits should they challenge Obama or bring up his past; the disgraceful maligning of innocent people perceived to be in his way to power (Joe the Plumber is a perfect example simply because he had the effrontery to ask a question whose response exposed Obama’s dangerous political philosophy – so Joe must now be destroyed); tricking the secret service into harassing civilians; the blatant voter fraud suggestive of Venezuela; his outright lies and bald faced contradictions; the class warfare, racists tactics, and grievance politics so prevalent in his campaign; the communist red star symbol used as his logo; the images of him done by propaganda artists reminiscent of the Third Reich; and that’s only the tip of the iceberg.  On October 29, 2008 the ONE will be pre-empting the opening game of the World Series to give a fake State of the Union Address.  How apropos!  This should go well with his fake Presidential Seal, his fake Air Force One, his fake Presidential World Tour, and his fake Styrofoam Greek columns; though I don’t know how well it’s going to play with all the ‘Joe the Plumbers’ out there to find their game on every major network taken over by Big Brother.|`|FBYec44Eaa	Bill Clinton said it best..<br>  <br>  Suppose, for example, you’re a voter, and you have candidate X and you have candidate Y.

After reading Biden’s remarks that day and comparing them to remarks Obama made about his support for the draft at the ServiceNation Presidential Forum at Columbia University on Sept. 11, 2008, I can come to no other conclusion.<br>  <br>  Obama: But it’s also important that a president speaks to military service as an obligation not just of some, but of many.....I think it’s important for the president to say, this is an important obligation. If we are going into war, then all of us go, not just some.<br>  <br>  And Biden’s remarks: "We do not have the military capacity, nor have we ever, quite frankly, in the last 20 years, to dictate outcomes," he cautioned.  "There are gonna be a lot of you who want to go, 'Whoa, wait a minute, … I don't know about that decision".<br>  <br>  Biden insists in his remarks that Obama's decision will impact ALL of the country negatively.  Biden couldn't be talking about some random international incident because that would only split the country.  So logically there's only one thing that would pit ALL US citizens against Obama in the way that Biden is asserting and that's the draft! Then I remembered the ServiceNation Presidential forum Obama attended and it became pretty darn clear that's what Biden was talking about.<br>  <br>  The reinstatement of the draft was in the DNC platform. Charlie Rangel (NY) spoke about it saying the burden should be spread around. Obama is in favor of both boys and girls signing up at age 18.   I think it’s connected to his call for more troops in Afghanistan.<br>  <br>  I was going to vote for Obama because he was opposed to the war.  Now that it appears he might be imposing a draft I’m no longer supporting him.|`|PVTLSg4Qaa	Saying Iraq is the reason you're voting for Obama makes no sense. That war is coming to an end no matter who the president is. Bush is leaving and McCain is nothing like Bush in the important areas. McCain brought the war to a faster end by pushing the surge. Obama didn't vote against the war - he wasn't a senator yet.<br>  <br>  Don't fall for the talking points. McCain is not like Bush, but Obama is a lot like Pelosi and Reid - they truly support the same agendas. Promising change is the oldest political ploy in the book.<br>  <br>  No, I won't vote for Obama. It's not about race to me, it's about the candidate. A question for some of you: would you vote for Obama if he was white?|`|tcCaaWRiaa	No, definitely not.  I love this great country with all my heart.  And even though I was, until this year, a Yellow Dog Democrat, I would never vote for Obama.  Why?  Because he went to an anti-American church for 20 years.  Who in their right mind would elect someone to run our country when they went to a church where the "pastor" said "God D*** America?"  Also, Obama launched his state senate campaign from a known terrorist's (Bill Ayers) house.  Disgusting!  Bill founded the Weather Underground, a terrorist group who said they would exterminate 25 million people if they didn't agree with the group's principles.  Ayers said in 2001 that he thought the WU "didn't do enough"!<br>  <br>  There are so many other reasons not to vote for Obama (e. g., lackluster voting record, no legislation to speak of, making deals with sleazy slumlords, not showing his birth certificate when there are serious questions about his citizenship which would make him ineligible for the office anyway).  For me, though, the main issue is that Barack Obama has horrible judgement, associations, and character.  I want a great man with principles and backbone to run this country, and that man is John McCain.

The Rezko scandal is about his government-funded low income housing deals more than about Obama's house deal.<br>  <br>  Obama has had radical associations his whole life, from his early communist mentor Davis, to his hero Saul Alinski (who dedicated his book to satan), to 20 yrs under Jeremiah Wright, to terrorists Ayers and Dohrn, to name but a few.<br>  <br>  In his short time there, Obama has earned the most liberal - make that leftist - voting record in the Senate.<br>  <br>  Obama has not been truthful about his past associations or record. He lied about Ayers and Wright. Rather than an agent of change, Obama was a aggressive protector of the very corrupt status quo in Chicago. But his campaign misled and went soft on facts and has had an impresionistic "the man is the message" theme. This is exactly how his friend Deval Patrick was elected in Massacheusetts, and once in office Patrick quickly earned abyssimally low approval ratings as the people realized they had been hoodwinked. It's no accident that both Obama's and Patrick's campaigns were run by David Axelrod,  spokesman for Chicago's mayor Daley, at the heart of the corruption.<br>  <br>  Obama will pursue a policy of socialism. He admittedly wants to redistribute wealth. That means raising taxes, a disastrous thing to do in a recession (this is what Carter and Hoover did). This will kill jobs and economic expansion. It will hurt the very people it claims to help.<br>  <br>  Obama has hardly ever bucked his party. Obama in the White House means the Dem congress, which might have veto- and filibuster-proof majorities, can do anything they want. Barney Frank wants to cut defense by 25%. John Kerry wants a second New Deal. The Dems want to return the misnamed Fairness Doctrine, which will put talk radio out of business, and maybe dampen Internet expression too.<br>  <br>  Despite his rhetoric, Obama has an anti-gun rights record. He was one of the few in the Illinois legislature to vote to criminalize unregistered guns used in legitimate self defense.<br>  <br>  Obama is very weak on foreign policy. He would have exited Iraq a loser, whereas we are now beginning to leave as a victor. He refused to fund the troops on the field. He repeatedly criticized the Surge that turned the tide. He brilliantly wanted to pass off the recent Georgian crisis to the UN - where the aggressor Russia has the veto. While running for the presidency he went to Europe to proclaim he is a citizen of the world. While there he had enough time to do that, but not enough time to visit our wounded troops.<br>  <br>  Obama is against drilling for oil. When it became an issue he then said he would allow it in order to get a bill passed. Then in debate #2 he slipped in "we need to drill". But finally in debate #3 it was back to "we can talk about drilling", which McCain called him out on. Simply put, he's insincere about it and just saying what people want to hear. <br>  <br>  Obama agitated and voted against a bill to ensure medical attention for aborted babies born alive, even though the Senate unanimously passed such a bill (yes,even Barbara Boxer voted for it), and abortion lobbyist NARAL itself was itself neutral on the bill.<br>  <br>  This is just a short list, one that my aching wrists will allow me to type. PLEASE get a hold of or download "The Case Against Barack Obama" QUICKLY, before the election. It is absolutely a tour de force. This man simply must not be allowed into the oval office. <br>  <br>  McCain is not perfect, but he is in a completely different league than Obama.

How odd?<br>  <br>  In October 1981, just outside of New York, on Long Island, there was a Brinks robbery, conducted by the Black Liberation Army (all twenty or so) and the Weather Underground. Two police officers and a Brinks guard were ambushed and murdered. One of the BLA, Nathan Burns, took the name Sekou Odinga. The Muslim thug president of Kenya and African travel partner of Obama and his first cousin is Raila Odinga. Very odd? What are the chances that Nathan Burns would choose the very unusual surname of Obama’s relative? The name is even unusual in Kenya! (This is the first coincidence.)<br>  Obama said he lived off campus, spent his time jogging or in the library. He’s not released any of his no doubt stellar academic records, or much of anything from his time at Columbia.<br>  <br>  More interesting is when Obama left New York; he went to Chicago to be a community organizer. One of his largest funding sources was Chicago United, owned by Tom Ayers, Bill Ayers' father.  (This is the second coincidence. – Very easy to verify that Tom Ayers owned Chicago United.  Obama, by his own admission admitted to working there.  Obama had no ties to Chicago so why did he go there unless told to do so by Ayers.)  Obama received funding from Tom from 1985 to 1988. Bill Ayers returned to Chicago in 1987 no longer underground. He also went into community organizing receiving funding from his father. When Obama left for Harvard he interned in the summer of 1989 at Sidney Austin in Chicago. There he met Michelle Obama who was working with Bernadine Dohrn, Bill Ayer's wife. (This is the third coincidence.)<br>  <br>  Yet, Obama claims he didn't meet Ayers until 1995?<br>  <br>  Via Stop the ACLU, here's video of Larry Grathwol, who joined the Weather Underground as a undercover law enforcement agent  <br>   <a href="http://www.stoptheaclu.com/archives/2008/10/22/obamas-friend-bill-ayers-planned-taking-over-government-re-education-camps-and-genocide/" rel="nofollow">http://www.stoptheaclu.com/archives/2008...</a><br>  <br>  I brought up the subject of what's going to happen after we take over the government. We become responsible then for administrating 250 million people … and there was no answers. No one had given any thought to economics. How are you going to clothe and feed these people? The only thing that I could get was that they expected that the Cubans, and the North Vietnamese and the Chinese and the Russians would all want to occupy different portions of the United States. They also believed that their immediate responsibility would be to protect against what they called the counter-revolution. They felt that this counter-revolution could best be guarded against by creating and establishing re-education centers in the Southwest, where we would take all of the people who needed to be re-educated into the new way of thinking and teach them how things were going to be. I asked, well what is going to happen to those people that we can't re-educate that are die-hard capitalists? The reply was that they would have to be eliminated. When I pursued this further they estimated that they would have to eliminate 25 million people in these re-education centers. When I say eliminate, I mean kill … 25 million people.<br>  <br>  I want you to imagine sitting in a room with 25 people, most of which have graduate degrees from Columbia and other well-known educational centers, and hear them figuring out the logistics for the elimination of 25 million people.

Significantly, that includes another key Obama contact, Mike Klonsky.<br>  <br>  Here’s what you need to know. Klonsky is an unabashed communist whose current mission is to spread Marxist ideology in the American classroom. Obama funded him to the tune of nearly $2 million. Obama, moreover, gave Klonsky a broad platform to broadcast his ideas: a "social justice" blog on the official Obama campaign website. <br>  To be clear, as it seems always necessary to repeat when Obamaniacs, in their best Saul Alinsky tradition, shout down the opposition: This is not about guilt by association. The issue is not that Obama knows Klonsky … or Ayers … or Dohrn … or Wright … or Rashid Khalidi …<br>  The issue is that Obama promoted and collaborated with these anti-American radicals. The issue is that he shared their ideology. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=OTQzMDIxZjlmMTM5N2ZhNzlmY2IyZDYxMWQ5NjQ2NDM=" rel="nofollow">http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=OTQ...</a>

00mE1I7Baa	Ultimately, it depends on the situation and how smart your lawyer is.<br>  <br>  If you're attending a public school, they can legitimately restrict your clothes to basically anything they want.  Many schools have strict dress codes or even uniforms; it is the school's right, as an extension of local government, to make and enforce these rules.<br>  <br>  If you're just walking around in public, there's mixed precedent.  On the one hand, most (if not all) municipalities have ordinances requiring people to wear clothes in public (or at least, ordinances that prohibit running about naked).  On the other hand, various courts have ruled that the government can't restrict clothing beyond some very specific cases.  They -can- prohibit people wearing government-issued uniforms to which they are not entitled, and they -can- prevent gang members from wearing gang-related paraphernalia (at least, they can in LA; check with your local jurisdiction for the laws there).<br>  <br>  So, it looks to me like it is a privilege, because there exist cases where the government can reasonably restrict folks from wearing certain types of clothing; in order to be an inalienable right, that can never occur.  Hope that helps!|`|p3li3v1Naa	I think that it's a right, but only for one reason.<br>  If the government wanted to they could pass a law forbidding just about anything, and even though nothing is truly protecting the right to wear a blue shirt, I think that it is too small of a thing for the government to even think about.|`|3aKe6C4Haa	I'll go with privilege. If  the government wants for some strange reason to make the wearing of a blue shirt illegal. Then it would seem that it was never a right to wear one but indeed it was just a privilege.

Jesus himself said his followers were no part of the world.  Thus, I maintain strict neutrality and I advocate God’s kingdom government.  <br>  <br>  What about Proposition 8 and all the other propositions?  After thousands of years attempting to govern ourselves, it should be readily apparent that effective self-government is beyond us.  That this is so can be seen in the way people chafe at the idea of other humans or governments telling them what to do; telling them how to conduct themselves; or setting moral standards or ethical principles for them.  Right here we read the responses of those who reflect the same attitude.  Genesis 19:9 reports on that attitude as well:  men who snorted arrogantly at the idea that Lot would ‘play the judge’ over them and their actions because they wanted to be free to have sexual intimacy with anyone whom they chose.  <br>  <br>  No different today.  Many feel that two people who fall in love ought to have the right to get married and they insist that their government legislate such a right.  This attitude, however, has not stopped there.  After having so long been force-fed this idea of there being nothing wrong with homosexual love, people have become quite comfortable with the idea of men marrying men and women marrying women.  What is on our plate now?  We read and hear the news reports of fleshly brothers and sisters falling in love, having sex, getting married, having children and insisting that they be allowed to stay married.  And why?  Because they love each other.  What does one suppose is next?  People falling in love with their pets? It is not out of the realm of possibility.  Bestiality has always existed; there is no reason to deny the distinct probability that soon enough, humans will demand that the government legislate their right to marry their animals.  <br>  <br>  I do not advocate marriage or sexual intimacy between people of the same gender.  From the Bible’s point of view, it is wrong.  But I do not interfere with the government legislating their right to marry.  Neither do I interfere with the government refusing to grant them such legal status.  I advocate God’s kingdom government as the panacea for all our woes.  <br>  <br>  Hannah J Paul<br>  |`|mOTCr8Pxaa	The gay marraige thing? No. But I don't live in kalifornistan.

PPTafHM4aa	The electoral system is a compromise that was reached by the states early in our country's history . <br>  <br>  Representatives of smaller state wanted each state to have a vote for president while the larger states wanted each person to have a vote. <br>  <br>  If the US president was elected by popular vote than they would be basically elected by the the people who lived in heavily populated areas. People from more rural areas would effectively be drowned out by the views and issues of the heavily populated areas.|`|2J5Zb7ubaa	The Electoral College is a system that is used in preliminary voting stages. For example, choosing the Democratic/Republican Presidential Candidate. So, the Electoral College decides if Hillary or Obama goes up against McCain. How does this voting work? The Electoral College does vote for states. If California has 55 Democratic Electoral votes, then you add that to Ohio's 24 Democratic Electoral votes, and so on. Okay, part two. The Electoral College, basically takes the votes, and counts them. If the vote is 50 Hillary and 51 Obama, then it automatically becomes Hillary 0, Obama 101. Don't ask my why. One more vote will definitely influence who becomes President or not.  Simply put, the Electoral College is a solid way of determining who "plays in the final round". There are no second tries.|`|AA10065077	Each state has a number of delegates. The popular vote of the population of each state is who the delegates vote for. This was designed so that hopefuls wouldn't just focus on heavy populated area. Example if the popular was Obama in Wisconsin the delegates that represent Wisconsin in the electoral college would vote Obama. |`|6a29fa9432cd11f6628b8d1ef1265ca6aa	Each state is a separate election. When a given candidate wins in the state, all of the states electoral votes go to the winner. So the people do influence the outcome, but it is possible for a candidate to win the popular vote and lose the electoral vote. Maine and one other state(Nebraska?) do not follow this system they split their electoral votes according to the proportion of voters who voted for each candidate. |`|jWGWW3PWaa	well depending on the population of the state you have a certain amount of electoral colleges, for example california has 55 and texas has 34. if california voted mostly democratic (which they usually do) then the democratic candidate would recieve 55 electoral college votes. if texas voted mostly republican, then the republican nominee would receive all 34 electoral college votes. your vote definately counts so please go out and vote!!!|`|Mqx0T7QVaa	The Electoral College is a method of indirect popular election of the President of the United States. The authors of the Constitution put this system in place so that careful and calm deliberation would lead to the selection of the best-qualified candidate. Voters in each state actually cast a vote for a block of electors who are pledged to vote for a particular candidate. These electors, in turn, vote for the presidential candidate. The number of electors for each state equals its Congressional representation.<br>  After Election Day, on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December, these electors assemble in their state capitals, cast their ballots, and officially select the next President of the United States. Legally, the electors may vote for someone other than the candidate for whom they were pledged to vote. This phenomenon is known as the "unfaithful" or "faithless" elector. Generally, this does not happen. Therefore, the candidate who receives the most votes in a state at the general election will be the candidate for whom the electors later cast their votes. The candidate who wins in a state is awarded all of that state’s Electoral College votes. Maine and Nebraska are exceptions to this winner-take-all rule.<br>  <br>  The votes of the electors are then sent to Congress where the President of the Senate opens the certificates, and counts the votes. This takes place on January 6, unless that date falls on a Sunday. In that case, the votes are counted on the next day. An absolute majority is necessary to prevail in the presidential and the vice presidential elections, that is, half the total plus one electoral votes are required. With 538 Electors, a candidate must receive at least 270 votes to be elected to the office of President or Vice President.|`|H4dswqRlaa	In California it won't work at all this year. The sizable number of GOP Electoral votes will ALL be given to Obama. How is this not election fraud at best, and outright theft at worst?<br>  <br>  The repair will be simple, but still hijackable through fraudulent manipulation of district boundaries.   Assuming there will be a minimum of that, simply making it Federal Law that "each district has one committed electoral vote", no human carrier of it being necessary or permitted, is obvious and as fair as it is reasonably possible to make it.|`|c3vPZfghaa	A state is divided into districts. within each district people vote for electors taht they are confident will cast their vote for the person they want elected to the executive office.Technically speaking, electors are free to vote any way they want.|`|13c1a3964502a363dd8ca6658b4b542daa	It works poorly.

Everyone there had studied the issues and had tons of references to back their words. <br>  Obama camp had most volunteers and money and local offices, The person in charge of Elizabeth City office took the time to ask the "Big Office" a few questions for me that did not show up anywhere in there literature.

PwHQSAxvaa	Why were you paying to a solicitor acting as agent for the car company? Was this part of the court order? But regardless of this arrangement, you should not be made to pay any sum in excess of that ordered by the court. If you have proof of the payments you have made, such as bank statements, show them to your own solicitor or save yourself some money and approach the county court yourself.|`|eUi7EFCdaa	Citizens Advice|`|9VIqX7jJaa	I would seek legal advice.  Something does not sound right.  Make sure that you can show proof of payment.|`|96d31f2eb78b0da781f956843c10646baa	The original County Court Judgement (CCJ) will clearly state the amount you owed and must pay back to the creditor (or their agent). All you need to do is work out the amount you have repaid to date and the amount still outstanding.  You need pay no more than the amount outstanding regardless of any claims for more than this from the creditor.<br>  <br>  Write to the creditor re: the above.  <br>  <br>  Do not agree to pay more than you have calculated that you still owe.  If the creditor disputes this, they must return to the County Court for a further Judgement.  This will be at their expense, and, given the circumstances, it is unlikely a CCJ for any further amount will be issued (plus the creditor will have to pay the court costs).<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA10065077	First, I suggest you go back to your Original amount you owe. Then subtract the amount of each receipt you have. Example your Original statement was you owed 16000. You made an arrangement to $400 per month. You have 12 receipts showing that you paid 12 times meaning you would subtract 4800 from the 16000. Do this just so you have an idea what you should owe. If that number is totally different from the other two you have ask for an explanation. If it equals near what the car company said then tough luck you are still responsible for that amount. Also getting legal advice wouldn't be a bad idea.|`|62hGVNhoaa	I think you are going to need help to sort this out, if you can afford it go and see a solicitor, if not try Citizens Advice.

Personally, I think Biden is an uninspired choice, but I can see that he would be able to work easily with Obama.<br>  <br>  Of course, in administrations past, the VP was completely ignored.  You could afford to have someone who wasn't a team player.  No longer.<br>  <br>  And another passing thought:  FDR didn't particularly like Truman, and Truman was certainly not a team player - but he was extremely convenient for bringing about harmony in the smoke filled rooms.<br>  <br>  And he turned out to be one of our better Presidents.

AgV9hSLJaa	ok here we go the first thing that is done is the bill goes to the clerks office where they make copies of it and give it an official number that it will be refered to they will give copies to all member of the house and have a formal first reading in the house. Then the the speaker of the house will assign the bill to a standing committe or several  standing committes the more committees that are on the bill the more likely that the bill will be killed. Once in the standing committee the speaker of the committee will assign it to a sub committee which is a group of reperseantatives of the standing committee, it is u[p to them to act on and if they dont the bill is killed and never to be seen again, unless there is a discharge potition which is when 218 members of the house sign a petion to save the bill and send it to second reading state where all of the house of rep. can make amendemnt to the bill. But if the standing committee does act on it and makes amendment then it goes to the rules committee which will then decide how the second reading will be done whether open or closed open is when all member of the house may make changes to it and closed is when just the original standing committee may make changes to it. then it goes on to 3rd reading stage where it is voted on and if passed it goes on to the senate. Then the senate does the first, second, and third reading stages just like the senate but they can add on rider which are amendment that have nothing to do will the actual bill it self and if a senator does not like the bill they might do a fillabuster and just talk for days at a time until the senate dismiss the bill just to end the fillabuster or they can vote on a coture to end the fillabuster. after the senate passes thier version of the bill the house and senate come together in a committee known as the conference committtee and they try to make a version of the bill that will make both the house and the senate happy. after that then it goes back to third reading stage in both the house and the senate and they vote. after that it then goes on to the president where he can veto the act of congress(bill)  or pass it.<br>  so it is alot of stuff hence why most bill dont get passed plus it takes alot of time and energy. sorry if there is a lot of misspelling. I tell you US governemt really makes you learn something though.|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	if it is passed in the house of reps, it goes to senate, if it passes it goes to pres, he can pass or veto, if pres vetos, congress can pass the bill if the get 2/3 vote|`|UM0V3Xn9aa	Why would they want to veto anything President Obama wants?|`|Myt4vwTFaa	they have to pass it and then the senate has to pass it and then the president has to pass it and if he veto's it then it has to go through both houses again and if they pass it it's a law. <br>  <br>  if enough people don't vote for it then it won't pass. <br>  and sometimes they don't even get around to looking at it for a looooong time or sometimes even at all.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEJL2Uuv-oQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEJL2Uuv-...</a><br>  <br>

I sent mine chips and girl scout cookies and as far as I know, there weren't any problems. just when you pack the box, pack it some what tight so things don't move around and you can pack some grocery bags around the chips to help hold them in place, if you have a Building 19 or a BJ's you might be able to get a full popcorn tin and empty it but the flat rate boxes are the cheapest way to go and if you get a box that will fit one of those tins it will cost you a good $30-$50 assuming the box is full, maybe more.

Idiots.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  This is for 'green' and anyone else pretending the Right isn't behind Limbaugh:<br>  <br>  One of those “idiots” adopting Limbaugh’s stance is former House Majority Leader Tom Delay (R-TX). In an interview with ThinkProgress at CPAC today, we asked DeLay whether he agrees with Limbaugh’s statements. DeLay said Limbaugh was “exactly” right to root for Obama’s failure:<br>  <br>  TP: Do you agree with Rush Limbaugh that we shouldn’t hope for President Obama to succeed?<br>  <br>  DELAY: Well, exactly right.

These are the same people that call dems sheep?!?!  Too funny.  Limbaugh doesn't know any facts.  He is all opinion, and his opinions are based on his ignorant and incorrect beliefs.

I was shocked when I heard the same thing and mad too. However I saw the video and what he said was.he wants Obama to fail ,not the country. Based on how he views American and its freedoms and self reliance sure he would.He has a fear the country will go down the hole and not recover because of a Trillion dollars borrowed and has to be paid back by future generations and his Socialist agenda. Obama's changes are so drastic in  Limbaugh's view  that he feels the Country as we know it will become like France or a Socialist country.I have known many people from thoes countries and they came here to get away from it. If you lived there you would know what they mean.As Americans we take so much for granted.Do you like the idea that some goverement agency could come into your home with no warrant,tell you how to live and think.Some people will give up these  freedoms just to be "taken care of" others would rather live in a gutter than give this up.Liberals think you are incapable of making a good life for yourself without programs and handouts.Consertives think each individual can make it a good life with a handup and traditionally with your own resources.  There is a little truth in both views.One of the most important things in your question is to get information from BOTH sources.You will get biased opinions from either side but study both sides,look for the truth and use your own intellect to decide what and how you view the subject.So much is distorted and taken out of context on both sides and I for one am sick of it and I don't trust the media anymore.The media has failed us for without fair and truefull reporting how can we make a intelligent decision.They have become gossip mongers|`|C0b6q7hiaa	The sin of pride.  Limbaugh believes if Obama gets us out of Bush's mess, then the U.S. will suffer even worse longer term.  The best analogy is FDR and New Deal.   Limbaugh would want FDR to fail, to prove his belief the Conservative Principles are supreme and always right.  Though he had no complaints about lowering taxes fo the richest people during a time of war doubling the deficit under Bush, so it's very hypocritical for him to be saying that.  Limbaugh believes if Obama succeeds in getting us out of Bush's mess, that long term, people will believe in Government again.|`|86990ea910ba06fc1046c0e615f983d3aa	To all of those that are posting that it's the liberal media....I beg to differ. Limbaugh said (from his own lips to my own ears) that he hopes Obama fails. If Obama fails, our country fails. Therefore, he must want the country to fail. Personally, I think that's a seriously high price for getting to say "I told you so". It's not worth it.|`|imtw3gNwaa	He never said he wanted the Country to fail, but that he wanted obama's socialist policies to fail... obama is not the Country, and I agree, obama needs to fail if we want the Country to succeed.|`|cb1d5eb8ef6d45defc8e354f3870d037aa	I want Obama's socialist agenda to fail.

kTOJ9XYcaa	No, tax cuts do stimulate the economy.  Most small businesses are schedule C taxpayers.  Therefore tax increases eat away in their profits to reinvest into their businesses.  This will tickle down to low business growth which will prevent them to hire workers.<br>  <br>  Therefore, tax cuts are good and your statement lacks merit.<br>  <br>  DTG|`|WCkOUF9aaa	I guess you never were educated about economics?|`|lQmGDPIoaa	****** EH RIGHT!

I hope that's not what you think because that would make you an idiot.|`|TFdKrkP2aa	That pretty much sums it up.|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	Good analogy.  What I don't get is, we have a gigantic deficit, the biggest in our history.    How on earth do you get out of that by cutting your income?  Taxes are the government's income.  Bush dug us a huge hole with his tax cuts and rebates (and, yeah, $300/person was really going to save everyone, right?)  <br>  The sickest part is that the Republicans seem to be hoping Obama's plan will fail.  They would actually let the economy sink even further, just so they could say they were right.  (Which they're not.)    It's almost as sick as the way they exploited 9/11 for their own purposes.<br>  Edit:  You make a great point about the necessity for some "socialism" in a capitalist economy.  Do we want to go back to the days when only the rich could send their children to school?  How about privately-owned roads you'd have to pay to use?  As a society, there are basics we must provide for everyone.  Taxes pay for those things.  And I notice that even John McCain has no problem accepting his Social Security check every month.|`|ljRE5MeAaa	As much as I hate to tip my hat to Senator McCain, he was right that tax cuts without comparable depending cuts take their toll.<br>  Bush got away with it until 2006, but the Democrats after scolding their way to victory, picked up the Pork-Laden Football and having achieved new spending records.<br>  TA DA!|`|ASXeYOjAaa	Wow! You've proven you don't have the first glimmer of an idea what taxes and tax-cuts are!!<br>  Stay quiet and fewer people will think you're a moron.<br>  <br>  Let me help. A tax-cut doesn't "give" anyone anything. Now I realize Dear Leader speaks of handing money to non-taxpayers and calls THAT a tax-cut but no honest person has ever used the term that way.<br>  <br>  A tax-cut is simply reducing how much of YOUR money the government is going to TAKE from you.<br>  <br>  On the next thing: Greed. Honest people use that word to mean wanting something you didn't earn or that otherwise isn't yours.<br>  "I want less to be taken from you" isn't particularly greedy of me.<br>  <br>  So, let's apply what you wrote to a one-on-one situation. Your friend is mugged and the robber finds $100 in his wallet. He takes $20 and bolts away. You're jealous your friend "was given $80" and call him greedy for missing the $20.<br>  <br>  Can you see why I advised you to keep your thoughts to yourself?<br>  <br>  O.K. saw the additional details. Seriously - shut the heck up while there is still someone you know who doesn't think you're an idiot!!!!<br>  <br>  -"Public" Education is a complete failure.<br>  - Military, Fire Department, Police, roads etc ARE paid for by us getting together with neighbors to pay for it!!!!! Did you honestly not realize that? Seriously - don't talk politics unless you want people to think you're profoundly retarded.<br>  Did you really ask if the SAME people who DO pay for it could still  "afford it" if less of the money was wasted by bureaucracies?<br>  (re-reading)<br>  Holy CRAP on a cross!!! You DID ask that. <br>  Huh. Evidently, severe mental incompetence doesn't mean one can't type.|`|AA10317675	Are you freaking kidding me???<br>  <br>  It is the Democrats taking mony out of the tax payer pockets to fund things like the San Fransisco Marsh Mouse!  Now, saving the marsh might be a worthy project, but I don't think it is fair to expect each of us to pay for it!|`|5rL4njnxaa	You obviously don't get it.  The tax cuts are good for the country because they give money to the rich who will support the Republicans who are good for the country.<br>  <br>  Now I hope you have seen the light.|`|CUVYxMF1aa	How is keeping more of one's hard earned money greed. People that want money directly funneled into their pockets have a greed addiction if it isn't theirs to begin with -- like welfare.|`|8916e90fdddb48c1a4e829a4efe53aa9aa	Yeah; just as ignorant questions like this are similar to cocaine up the nose of a Demolemming.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  You are a Socialist moron; accept that fact and move on with life, idiot.|`|407f2f3df56644b5cae9f978edcbb062aa	The credo of the Republican, "more..."|`|lyhnHhuWaa	Right now I'm being taxed for a total of about 42% of what I earn.  That means that after federal income taxes, state income taxes, state/municipal sales tax and county/municipal occupational taxes (not even counting FICA tax) I end up keeping about 58% of the money that I work for.  Nobody from the government, nor anyone who receives government aid, shows up to clock in and work a shift for me... I earn the money.  I'm not a wealthy person, nor am I poor.  As a single mother of two, a tax cut would mean the opportunity for more choices and better options for higher education for my children.  If that makes me greedy then, by all means, count me among the greedy!<br>  <br>  Edit - I earn considerably more than 40K, but under the "wealthy" mark of 250K.  I have no problem whatsoever with paying taxes to support a federal military (defense being the fed's primary purpose for existence) or municipal fire & police departments.  I know that my tax burden would be considerably lower if I were only contributing to necessary spending, but I'm not.  I'm contributing to waste and greed on the part of politicians whose goal is to keep their constituants happy so they keep a job.  The state of education in this country is deplorable and money won't fix the problem.  My daughters are in the public school system that I contribute to through my property and federal taxes.  In addition to that, I'm having to teach them many things that the public education system isn't.  I'm also paying a learning center to offer them an advanced curriculum that keeps them from becoming bored with the "advanced" curriculum offered in the public schools.  If I could afford it, they would be out of the public system altogether.  Until there is competition between schools to provide excellence in education, it won't be seen.  Government money can't generate a desire for teachers to educate anyone.  As it is now, I see teachers focused on getting kids through a test so school funding is upheld.  They're essentially enslaved to the government and don't have the freedom to truly educate children.  It's all about keeping up the funding.  If people had a choice as to where to send their children and funding followed the kids, schools would tighten up and begin educating in a hurry.  Combine that with the fact that teacher's unions make it near impossible to fire the moronic ones who shouldn't be teaching and it's a recipe for disaster.  Public schools aren't doing our children ANY favors.|`|XxUByikJaa	Madoff sure Knew how to play on their greed .

Without that kind of business, it would have a ripple effect in every single industry. <br>  <br>  This is not a concrete number, but a personal guess. If we let AIG and the automakers fail, our unemployment would probably be somewhere above 40%. Granted, there's always the chance the free market could right itself, but I'm not sure if that big of a  blow could be shrugged off quite as easily as one plant shutting down in a nowhere town in Idaho or something.<br>  <br>  Edit: I really can't stand it when undereducated people call the bailouts "handouts."

On post in civilian clothes they are authorized earrings but not any other piercings (but it is rarely enforced).  Off-post is the same for males.<br>  <br>  You can have holes, but you can't have anything in them.

But do we really need yet another legal substance to abuse by our ever increasingly undisciplined, self indulgent, and immature society. No where in here am I going to make any of the standard arguments about a gateway drug or overdosing, etc. It's scare tactics and does not speak to the root of the issue. I am a boomer and saw a lot of drug use when I was younger, and I only saw one OD and 2 people who are permanently affected by drug use. What I do see now 30 years later are just tons of people who can't manage reality and disappointment effectively because they ran away and hid from reality. They have college degrees and big jobs but the emotional maturity of a teen, which is where they stopped growing. these are my reasons for opposition, and it is the same with alcohol, (And I come form a family of tavern owners).

IIPCgK50aa	In my opinion i believe the war on drugs has been a complete waste of resources, time and money. The war on drugs has not even made a dent on international drug trade. As long as the demand is there people will continue to sell and make drugs.<br>  <br>  I believe that the majority of drugs should be legalized with the exception of meth, heroin and crack. Obviously the distribution of drugs should be regulated but i believe this would solve many of the problems the war on drugs failed to address:<br>  <br>  1) Our streets and homes would be safer<br>  2) It would stop prison overcrowding<br>  3) It would free up police resources<br>  4) It would unclog the court system<br>  5) It would decrease corruption<br>  6) Save tax money<br>  7) Reduce organized crime<br>  8) Legal drugs would be safer (drugs would not be cut with the impurities that are in them today)<br>  9) Stop the spread of HIV and other diseases<br>  10) New source of tax revenue for governments<br>  11) Reduce prostitution<br>  12) Reduce gang violence<br>  <br>  Obviously there are negatives to legalizing drugs but i believe the positives that occur from legalization out weigh the negatives.|`|KslfBKo4aa	For the past 15 years I've been saying that we need to legalize drugs and focus on rehabs and drug education.<br>  <br>  The only reason there is a war is because too many people will lose their jobs and there is way too much money invested in it.<br>  <br>  If the government would only realize that it could make more money by taxing recreational drugs while at the same time eliminating the profit organized crime makes off them, then it could eliminate several problems in one shot.|`|HltUWMgOaa	I would over fly the areas where the drugs are being grown and NAPALM them.|`|mD2P3rMyaa	there hs been a war or drugs????|`|vtpWPL0eaa	we should spend that same money to help our schools, keep teachers with jobs, and provide food and clothing to the poor. <br>  the war on drugs is futile. people have all drugs, in all states, and in most every city. the only people winning this war, are the people not getting caught. that includes the corrupt government that allows the importation of mass quantities of drugs into our country. <br>  we have spent over 300 billion since 1998 on this "war", were just throwing gasoline on the fire. until marijuana is legalized, everyone will be drawn to foul and hard drugs like ice, heroin, coke, and crack. <br>  nobody would use that foul crap if they could go to a starbucks, and have some amazingly sweet, potent and completely safe and enjoyable weed. hydro, kind bud, or any good smoke readily available.<br>  this war was made to keep the alcohol, and tobacco companies rich. <br>  i would never touch a cigarette again if i could smoke good bud. and i would only have a drink on special occasions. i know a hundred people who can say the same. this is meant to keep pharmacutical companies rich too, because weed has amazing medicinal values too.<br>  best cure for loss of appetite, antisocialism, and insomnia- all symptoms of depression. weed would put antidrepressants like prozac, and zoloft off the maket. it would also take away repeat customers from many stupid psychyatrists.|`|AA10065077	For me, I feel that the war on drugs has been a total waste of time and money. Like others I feel that the money should be used for other things like education, re building some communities, and of course rehab programs. Educational material should be avalible to let people know how bad things are. Most people that do drugs know that it is bad, but still do first as thrill seeking then because they are addicts. If drugs were legal that elimate most crime. Think about it, people get killed because of a drug deal gone bad. People are sitting in prison with a drug charge. If drugs were legal that would eliminate prison over crowding. If people want to do something they are going to find away. |`|P0TDD2ftaa	If it were a war on every hard drud EXCEPT marijuana then yes but since thats not the case then NO.

Ernst Rhom ran the SA for Adolph Hitler in the 30's, doing the National Socialist's strong arm dark alley work, until Hitler had obtained legitimacy, and then he was murdered along with much of the rest of the civilian security force in an incident called the "Night of the Long Knives". In the US some of th e"militia" groups may be defined as such, and we all know how much we trust them with their unauthorized, unregulated "power".<br>  I think it may be President Obama's mistrust of the loyalty of conventional authority like law enforcement and the military that is leading him on this path.

He wants a force that will take the place of domestic police and our armed forces and he also wants some of this special force to include thousands of volunteer high school and college students.

If we are to guide ourselves by Mr Hussein`s words, his govenrment policy for Americans is " Do as I say, not as I do".<br>  <br>  I wonder if he is going to have Rahm Emanuel run that "Secret Police" for him, just like Hitler had Ernst Rhom run his SA for him. Can`t get over the similarities of Rahm Emanuel and Ernst Rhom`s names. Much like the similarity of the names of Barack Hussein Obama #2 and Joe Biden with the name of Osama Bin Laden.

Don't agree that they wanted to lose; on the contrary, they wanted to win so badly that they went for the flashy, but ultimately hollow persona of a right-wing female ideologue, trying to attract (1) the party wingnuts (succeeded), and (2) disenchanted Hillary supporters (failed miserably).

HkVWiQ9Eaa	Germany received the blame. Germany started the war, Hitler took over Germany in times of crisis and started his dictatorship by making people be patriotic and proud. They wanted to win their land back after they were taken by them in world war 1.|`|AA12384954	My parents (both English) believed it was caused by a german heir to the english throne not being recognised and crowned prior to World War 1.  There does seem to be some validity there.  England (mother country) and Germany (father country) had close royal ties.  I didn't get the opinion from them that Germany wanted to destroy England though.  The royal palaces were largely left unscathed.  Europe had been gripped by depression, and living standards were hard for many.  So many factors though it would be difficult to point to one particular event or person.  As far as Hitler is concerned I think the problem there was that so many supported him, and you'd have to look for the reasons they did.|`|AA10065077	Actually, World War 2 was just a continuation of World War 1. There is no specific event to blame. After World War 1 Germany was declared at fault and forced to pay the rest of the world back for the cost of the World War. The 1930s was a bad time for everyone. Germany was looking for someone to blame and Hitler offered the Jews. The Jewish people had control of the banks and when loans were made they had to be payed back with interest. Hitler was elected and he decided that he wanted to Create a supreme race. He opened concentration camps, took the jewish peoples assets, and put them in the concentration camps. People that were unfit to work were first killed in vans that had the exhaust pumping into the back of it first and later the gas chamber. Hitler then decided that he was going to get even with the European powers so he went after France and England. This was the beginning.

tROFU72waa	You'll have to call a US Army recruiter for a valid answer.  The way it works is that you turn in your diploma or school transcripts for a "tier" evaluation.  A Tier 1 is a valid HS diploma, whereas a Tier 2 is a valid GED. Tier 3 being an invalid educational certification.  Call the Army guy on Monday morning and tell him what you've got and see where they'll go from there.  If it was enough to get you into College than it should be sufficient to get you into the Armed Forces.|`|6Fsliwlhaa	This is what it says in the AR 601-210, Chapter 2-7:<br>  <br>  (9) HSDG via Completion of Job Corps Vocational Training Program (ED LVL C). Any applicant who has completed at least 675 clock hours of post-secondary vocational technical training from the Job Corps operated by the Department of Labor and earned a GED or other TIER 2 education credential will be considered an HSDG. Applicants must present a Job Corps Certification of Student Graduation and Completion of Vocational Training Form signed by the Job Corps center director and training director for verification. Job Corps students must be enrolled in Job Corps for a minimum of 60 days prior to enlistment.<br>  <br>  So by that, you can come in as long as you meet all other requirements (physical, ASVAB, dependents, and law violations).

qQEl7Fukaa	You may be overstating things a bit, but I have seen some questions that violate YA community guidelines. Usually the rest of the contributors let the asker know in no uncertain terms what they think about those questions. Other questions are strong opinions that may offend, but are still within the guidelines. <br>  Due to the nature of certain sections, emotions tend to run high.

She will have a longer political life, if she stays in the Senate. I think she is smart enough to make the right decision.

You go girl, don't let him screw you again.|`|baaf30673b204103b269ddf718be2c5caa	Who's Barry?

Clinton has no chance of getting the nomination in 2012, and she knows it. Her window has closed. <br>  <br>  I think Obama likes the idea of having a strong Cabinet, and wonders if Clinton might be able to contribute in foreign policy. Can't hurt to ask.|`|56ee2b80889254372942af362f9b659daa	The problem with that strategy is that Hillary can resign for the cabinet at any time.  In that situation the incumbent would be running against an insider.  Bas strategy for both.  I don't think Hillary wants to be owned by Obama.|`|fbb4ab0738eb7d2ea8be8024fec8d32aaa	The headline now is the decision is between her and Richardson (oh, well, duh!).  I think that already means that Clinton has declined the offer in private, but now has to give Obama a graceful "out".|`|92gN7RVPaa	Disagree|`|AA10065077	It is always better to have a Clinton in the basket with you instead of having them outside. Obama didn't invite Hillary to be his vp because he then couldn't use her at his pleasure. I think he will select Hillary because he knows when he can use her at his pleasure he can benefit greatly. Look how good Hillary was when she needed 20 million and Obama had 100 million. Hillary's speech at democratic convention is still being talked about. Obama wants a cabinet with rivals. Now, the question is will Hillary accept? Hillary is the JUNIOR senator for New York. She asked Ed Kennedy the chairman of Health committee in the senate to make a sub committee and she head it. Ed Kennedy wouldn't do it and he didn't want to pass up others in the senate with more years than Clinton. Hillary is years away from a chair or any real position of power in the Senate. She likes power, but she doesn't want to be second fiddle to Obama. It will be interesting.|`|zcvs5iZMaa	I wonder why they let that crap happen, anyway.  I mean, who's in charge here, anyhow?  Who holds the power, anyway?  Well, I can only hope it goes well for us and not be too pessimistic about it.

Both Gore and Kerry got more votes than Bush, but lost in the Electoral College which will be Dec 15 this time around.<br>  <br>  Gore lost Florida even though a complete count sponsored by a German university showed that Gore got more votes except for in the Supreme Court. Kerry lost in Ohio and New Mexico even though an audit done by UC Berkeley showed that Kerry got more votes in both states. In both cases the injustice was enough to tip the Electoral College. In both cases, there has never been a dispute that the opponents got more votes than Bush nationwide.<br>  <br>  As for Obama being Bush's lackey on all the most important issues as suggested by a previous answerer, everything he put down is correct, but he forgot a couple:<br>  <br>  Obama voted to fund Bush's wars without fail.<br>  Obama rushed back to Washington to push Bush's bailout plan.<br>  <br>  As for Obama being elected, The Electoral College is still ahead (Dec 15), and Justice Souter of the Supreme Court ruled last Friday that Dec. 1 would be the deadline for Obama to produce proof that he is a natural born citizen.

Did you defend his actions?  The Democrats in Congress did that until 2003 because it was politically expedient to do so.  And the public knew it because they lost seats in 2004 in the House and Senate.<br>  <br>  And as for popularity, Obama is popular for giving speeches and not being Bush.  If his popularity was based on actual accomplishments, he would not be popular, would he?|`|AA10065077	The only way to compare Bush to Obama is there stance on issues. I'll save you time researching and just tell you that their views are going to be totally opposite. One should always have respect for whoever the president is. Bush was elected by the by people that is why he deserves respect. It's just that he has made wrong decisions and we as a nation are being laughed at for those decisions. Bush represents us on the world stage. What nation's leaders see about Bush they see in Americans. As far as being sore losers, McCain was not a sore loser. He called Obama to congratulate the night of the election before it was offically over. The McCain campaign is what is making the GOP look like sore losers. Passing blame on to each other 'till there is no one left but Sarah Palin. Yes, I'm willing to give Obama a chance, but talk is cheap. |`|DIAEpt2laa	i love how the term "whiny liberal" can't be used anymore b/c all i hear is pouting from the GOP. sure we were upset. and after the past 8 years, it's blatantly obvious that we had good reason b/c anybody could see how inept the bush administration was. don't moan about how obama MIGHT make things worse. our country is far worse than it was before. the republicans had their chance to make things better and face it, they screwed up - big time. if anyone thinks they can be trusted to another presidential term, the entire world except 48% of the US disagrees.<br>  <br>  with all of the real problems we have in the world now, we need to stop devoting so much attention to issues like gay marriage and abortion that do not influence anybody's lives but those involved. (honestly! why do people freakin' care?!!)|`|OUtcHIm0aa	They will say whatever to make Obama look bad. Don't vote Obama he'll raise taxes!!!! Their needs to be taxes to fix our economy, after the job that Bush did to it. Also some are sure that Obama's Arab or middle eastern and not from the United States. They should take a look at McCain he wasn't even BORN IN THE US! Obama doesn't have the experience, but he has the knowledge and respect. Who can respect a guy who cheats on his wife who's been disabled from a car accident, after she was waiting for him to come back from a war that he got his unit in trouble with. He's the reason they got caught and were held captive. Than he elected that disaster of a woman Sarah Palin. The only reason he elected her was for woman voters, that shows you something about him because SHE HERSELF wasn't qualified. She does nothing for feminism except for being a joke because, she portrays herself as a shopaholic floozy, and is a dumb *****. Not to mention she is against abortions even in rape and incest. I hope she gets raped by a family member. All he ever did was do things to get into office, he didn't care about the American people, all he wanted was the title of president. He must have a small penis or something.|`|ZBeIpyaGaa	Those who hate Obama need something to fear ... something to twist their little minds around to keep them occupied.  I understand not agreeing with policies - I understand even a general disliking for him.  However, the amount of hate and intolerance I have seen makes me scared for the future of our country ... we don't deserve to be the world's "beacon" if we are divided and hateful.  Yeah, I said it.  |`|evDEBw0daa	I have to add to Saracuda.  Bush and Obama both did cocaine.  Bush and Obama both had/have high approval ratings going into office.  Bush and Obama both had people who voted for them from both sides of the aisle.  <br>  <br>  In some ways you are right like Bush had more experience and we know that he has low approvals.  But I also beg to differ on the point that it is all republicans. This is not a party issue.  Staunch democrats and liberals voted for McCain.

pglTZOi3aa	Because the DAs do pretty thorough investigating and if they take a case to trial then they're pretty sure the person is guilty.  If they don't have the evidence, it doesn't go to trial.|`|L2bQifUXaa	Because not many innocent people are accused.. There is usually evidence that they did something wrong before being charged...|`|b3640707e483a3b444b16b298a3378aeaa	Mostly because you have to have an airtight case just to get to court. Otherwise, things are settled well ahead of time out of court. <br>  <br>  If anything, some guilty people probably get away because of technical mistakes in the court case or sympathetic juries.<br>  <br>  Live and learn, my friend. These prosecutors are good at their jobs.|`|AA11694451	Ok, it is time to get a reality check. Once a person is placed under suspicion of a crime, the authorities gather evidence. Once they have gathered enough evidence that they know at a 99.99999% certainty they have their person, the case is brought to a grand jury. If the grand jury feels the prosecution has a good leg to stand on, it gets taken to a trial. Usually it is a trial by jury, but at times it is left to the judge. By the time it gets this far, you had better have the best defense lawyer with a good reasonable doubt story, because the evidence against you is very damning. It is amazing to me that 4% have a good enough lawyer to get them off the charges.|`|Spr3E5FWaa	Because it would be a waste of resources if prosecutors pressed charges in questionable cases.  I think that is a good number, it means that prosecutors are not bringing charges against innocent law abiding citizens.|`|9cpKYneZaa	That's because the prosecution has all of the resources of the state behind them, and the defendant either has a public defender or has to spend every cent he has to defend himself.|`|AA10065077	First the prosecution makes the defendant scared so that that they'll plead out. Second, comes lawyers. Most people get public defenders. Then it comes down to what a jury believes: cops and the medical examiner, or the defendant and their friends

I can sleep well now.|`|AA11157806	I never thought she fired a librarian, but the fact that she even hypothetically brought up banning books is outrageous enough in its own right.  This is America-freedom of speech, period. Intelligent, understanding and rational people don't even consider the banning of books from the general public. It seems as though she was considering the possibility, which is why it was brought to light to begin with.<br>  I don't think liberals are afraid of her. I think Democrats, liberals, Libertarians, Progressives and Republicans are terrified of what she represents-a continuation of the transformation of the Republican party into religious nuts who know understand nothing of the modern world as seen through the eyes of a rational person-that is, a world not seen with blind obedience and empty hatred. If the Republican party continues on the same path it began taking with George W. Bush, it will be a sad day in American politics when the rest of the world is justified in their assumption that we are an ignorant uncaring people.|`|0f0dac4f4bfb6a4b2d01df90fd84b3ffaa	Emmons had been city librarian for seven years and was well liked. It was only after a wave of public support for her, Palin relented and let Emmons keep her job.<br>  <br>  Sure Palin didn't officially declare the reason for Emmon's termination as the book banning incident, but that begs the question of why fire a successful competent librarian in the first place? It seems clear that she must have been fired for political reasons by the process of eliminating all other possible causes.|`|VB3ZK5f9aa	Caught in a time warp?  That was a topic one or two months ago.<br>  <br>  There is never anything hypothetical about asking about banning books.  It's never hypothetical when the person is later fired.  It is always suspicious when a politician fires someone who ideologically disagreed with them.  The politician can always claim it was for another reason.  That doesn't apply to one politician or one situation.|`|pM81f5tnaa	Well, that's Palin's version of the story.  And maybe she's telling the truth.  Maybe she asked about the book banning, and just by coincidence, the librarian lost her job shortly thereafter.  Stranger things have happened.<br>  <br>  But why would a governor *hypothetically* ask about banning books?  What in the world could she have been thinking?|`|un0C52G8aa	I've known that all along but it does bother me that she even broached the subject of banning certain books. That's because I don't like censorship of any kind. In my opinion, if something offends you, then don't read it. Just don't tell others not to read it or try to prevent them from doing it by having certain books that you object to pulled.|`|54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	That's not the only thing the liberal media have lied about.

Even if Palin did re hire this person Palin terminated her first. Question for you, If your boss asked you a question and did not like your answer and recently after that your boss "let you go" because of a different reason. Even if your termination reason had nothing to do with your answer to a question would you still view it as your boss "let you go" because they didn't like your point of view on something. I am with you on the media though. I didn't like the media coverage at all during this election.|`|HdgA8pLqaa	But why did she "briefly" fire the librarian in the first place?<br>  <br>  I doubt the liberal media has to lie about Sarah Palin - there's too much wacko behavior (not to mention more than a few lies) from her.  It's like what Tina Fey said - that the SNL writers hardly had to write material about Palin because they only needed to use her actual words to get big laughs.<br>  <br>  |`|9650396843d5fb5c87832f3226bd9287aa	I don't know what happened to the librarian.  The real question is, what the hell is she doing questioning an employee about censorship in the first place?  The fact that Palin said later that it was just a test sounded very lame.|`|c1b8d1e146f67c24fce8487a20a072b9aa	I think a lot of people have bought into a lot of blatant liberal lies about Palin.

I'm not forbidding you nor opposing your rights to ask it, but I'm just honestly questioning why this has been an important issue???  Did you notice anything different between McCain and say Kerry, Gore???  Please enlighten.<br>  <br>  It's like asking, do you think McCain walked on stage better than past presidential hopefuls that failed??

YnFvmrDjaa	I brought my own to BMT but everyone in my flight had to purchase and use the white New Balance shoes. No exceptions. They are comfortable but not the best.  |`|IgJsKbDRaa	Ask your recruiter- they should know. I know in the army a lot of people brought their own running shoes and if you didnt bring them, you had to purchase them on an advanced pay card they gave (which got deducted from your first months pay). I dont know about air force because they do not do the same amount of running and they have different guidelines than the army. They (your recruiting station or on the air force website)should have a list of items you can bring. If not- just wear them with the outfit you leave for BMT in and see if they let you use them. Good luck.|`|2cnDm4QKaa	When I went into the army, they mad all the guys in basic buy running shoes. At the shoe place, they made you talk with a specialist there and they would help you pick out the best shoe for you.|`|FGbAGa1Taa	have you taken your physical yet? bc i know they check for flat feet there, and its not a good thing for them to find out. I'd ask your recruiter....|`|lTpzPCoqaa	I was issued running shoes when I got to basic. If thing haven't changed in the last 6 years then you would be issued them as well. It's to make everyone look the same when in formation.|`|2Hlctljgaa	Yes, it was on my list of stuff to bring.  I would assume that it is still true today.  |`|0f0dac4f4bfb6a4b2d01df90fd84b3ffaa	Well if the air force is like the army, they will check your feet to see if you are either flat footed or have high arches, and you will buy shoes that are appropriate for either condition.

rxMHRbTzaa	 If you are serious about joining Army Special Forces you are lucky because now is the perfect time to do it. I am reffering to the Army's 18X program that you mentioned in your question. Today guys like you can sign up for SF with your recruiter and not have to "pay your dues" in the regular Army first. If there would have been a program like that when I joined the Army I sure would have taken advantage of it. I had to spend over a year in the Army before I even had the chance to try out for SF. <br>   In the 18X program you will go to Basic Training like anyone else who joins the Army, then go to Infantry school, Airborne school, and finally get your chance to try out for SF without wasting your time serving in the regular Army first. You will be surrounded by other 18X guys trying to do the same thing and you will help each other out and support each other. All of the 18X guys you will be with will be a little older and more mature than your average new soldier. You will be promoted up to the NCO ranks much faster than regular soldiers. As a Special Forces soldier you will earn more money than others in the Army. There is Airborne pay, Demolition pay, Special Duty pay, and if you learn your foreign language well enough you get paid for that too. It is not easy but anything worthwhile never is.|`|QG1MBwwvaa	hey man, im an army ranger in a recon(spy) platoon bro, the GT score is based on your mathematical skills and your science skills. i tryed did a SF selection and it lasted 14 days, it wasn't all that bad, a lot of physical activity but i didn't get selected, dunno why, they don't tell you. I started off in infantry...If you are going to pursue that route i would definitly go infantry, they will get you into shape so you can make the cut. If you join you will have to go to a recruiter, he will set you up with everything, they will send you to a place called MEPS and that's where you do your physical and eye exam's and your ASVAB. after you swear in you will have prolly like 5 or so days to spend with your family and your recruiter will bring you on your way to a place called 30th AG. that place is hell, you will begin your first day of minor suck. they will keep you up for like 48 hours without sleep and then you will be like for a week or so. then they will send you to Fort Benning Georgia for infantry school. 16 weeks of solid suck but you feel awesome after you complete it. BTW it's deadly hot there. DRINK LOTS OF WATER! anyway's if you want to know more, e-mail me and ill hook you up bro...|`|RTBuK59Daa	Any SF is extremely difficult, no matter what branch you are in.  I'd recommend going to college if you have the chance, and then if you are still interested go in with a degree, and a commission.  If you think it looks like fun with all these great commercials you see on TV, trust me, you will hate most of it. But it does feel good knowing you served your country!  Unfortunately its serving for the rich people who run it while all the little puppets go off to fight for their oil. |`|is5DpAjEaa	Oi Oi, EOD is NOT Special Operations .. do not attempt to sell it as so, doing so insults all of the other EOD techs that have worked hard to earn their crab.

If your looking to shoot all the guns, and have all the fun, you definatley wanna go infantry or SF. I myself am in the Infantry. I have a 15 month deployment under my belt with the 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team. We were in Mosul, Anbar, Baghdad, and in the Diyala Province in a town called Baqubah. If you're looking to go SF, you would have to join in as an 18x MOS. That will take you to Fort Benning, GA. There you will go through regular Infantrymans Combat Training. Then you will move on to airborne school. If you make it through that, you'll go through SF's cue course and then to Selection. Once you pass those, you will be called a Green Beret (SF). It takes time and everyone has to start from scratch. You should email me and we can talk. email me at dot_kom_2001@yahoo.com|`|CNxOdgxvaa	First of all you don't go down to your local recruiter and Sign up for the SF,in any branch of the service.The Air force has the PJ's Para jumpers their main mission is to jump in and rescue downed pilots.the army's special forces are force multipliers .there mission is to work with and train locals to be resistant fighters,it was the muclanards in vietnam,they even trained and worked with the Afghan freedom fighters in the 80's when Russia invaded Afghanistan.you must have to mos S be in top shape and b a E5 or above to be accepted for training .Some thing to think about is the mp s you wont be doing the same thing every day,you mechanized which means you don't have to walk every where and the are combat arms so you will see some action if that's what you want .|`|kW2xwCCbaa	Sum1udontknow ; has the best answer . I was going to go SF as an 18x candidate , but i have changed my mind, and am now going to go 11b . And if i feel up to it , and wanna go that route i will get my packet together and apply, with experience as being a Soldier. AR + VE = GT ..... You have to apply as an 18x if you enlist , and then go to SF prep course , and then head to SFAS . If you get selected you get to go to SFQC , and if you survive that you get your Green Beret , and still have to learn a language.. Not for the physically weak , and especially NOT for the MENTALLY WEAK .. |`|pwdv08hVaa	Air Force Pararescue is considered one of the toughest special ops in the world, and a big advantage PJ's have over others is that they get top notch medical training so if you dont want to make it a career you will have no problem getting a job as a paramedic<br>  <br>  *EDIT* ok, then in the Army there are a lot of options for special operations (the green berets official name is special forces, every other is called special operations forces) you can become a Ranger, or as i hear there is now an enlistment option that guarentees you can try out for special forces, the 101st and 82nd Airbourne i believe is considered spec ops<br>  <br>  talk to a recruiter he can tell you for sure|`|q0gnYRPKaa	Air Force Special Forces are:<br>  <br>  Combat Controller<br>  TAACP<br>  PJ's<br>  <br>  <br>  And some would consider our EOD team to be Special Forces because we are elite.

xRbL1xJ7aa	Get a life. You sound like Hitler. It's a myth that all Jews are rich and own the all banks and big business. That's exactly how Hitler got the germans to hate the Jews. The German people had nothing and the German Jews had everything.  <br>  <br>  I'm Jewish. My family never had money. My house was sold by the bank after it went into foreclosure and I have very little. Most Jews I know are in the same situation. Of course there are wealthy Jews, but as you said being 2% of the population, if that's even correct, there are a hell of alot of non-Jews who are alot richer, have alot more of everything, so please stop spreading rumor's and hate. The majority of Jews are suffering the same as everyone else. <br>  <br>  If you hate Jews, then hate them. We could actually care less.

That is why a lot of Jews are smart and highly educated. Jews tend to be over represented in universities, medicine, etc. So if a Jewish person is the most qualified for a position, it only makes sense to hire him for that position. We should hire the best qualified people regardless of their race, religion, etc. President Obama seems to be doing that. This is in sharp contrast to the last President Bush, who hired his close friends and cronies for positions they were totally unqualified for.|`|b8754e91196200e84629988cb6632b19aa	Yes and they made a mint selling bad paper to Asia...

They control the money of the world and thus they control the world.  There may be some Jewish people involved, but I don't really think so.  Actually no one really knows, including our government who owns and profits from the federal reserve.  Our country would be far better off if the government controlled the printing of money but two presidents were killed when they attemped to do so,  Presidents Lincoln and Kennedy.<br>  You see those behind the federal reserve would never allow such a thing to happen because if it did, then they would no longer be control of the destiny of the world.  Beware of one world government and  a one world banking system.

I didnt vote for him (didnt vote for McCain either, btw), but I felt that neither candidate would change a lot of things. Bills need to be introduced in the House, then move to the Senate, then the President signs in into law, or vetoes it. So essentially there is not much he can introduce. He can lobby the Dems in Congress to introduce bills, and he can do so as well, but it still has to pass there before he actually signs them into laws. And honestly, I doubt that the majority of Congress (despite them being in the Democratic majority) would pass everything he introduces. Remember, Obama won the presidency by default, not necessarily by being publicly liked. California voted for Clinton in the Primary, and so did many other states, but they essentially voted for Obama in the Presidential election so that no Republican would win. Some people think he was the lesser of the two evil. <br>  Again, I DIDN'T vote for him, and that is certainly not my opinion, but I have heard this statement from many of my democratic, left wing liberal coworkers.  |`|AA10065077	We will see.

As soon as election results are final, the States prepare seven or nine original "Certificates of Ascertainment" of the electors chosen, and send one original along with two certified copies (or three originals, if nine were prepared) to the Archivist of the United States. <br>  December 15, 2008 - Meeting of Electors: The electors in each State meet to select the President and Vice President of the United States. The electors record their votes on six "Certificates of Vote," which are paired with the six remaining original "Certificates of Ascertainment." The electors sign, seal and certify the packages of electoral votes and immediately send them to the President of the Senate, the Archivist of the United States and other designated Federal and State officials.<br>  December 24, 2008 - Deadline for Receipt of Electoral Votes: The President of the Senate, the Archivist of the United States, and other designated Federal and State officials must have the electoral votes in hand.<br>  January 6, 2009 - Counting Electoral Votes in Congress: The Congress meets in joint session to count the electoral votes (unless Congress passes a law to change the date).<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/provisions.html#provisions" rel="nofollow">http://www.archives.gov/federal-register...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/provisions.html#12" rel="nofollow">http://www.archives.gov/federal-register...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_amendments_11-27.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charter...</a><br>  <br>  What impact does a candidate's concession speech have on the Electoral College process?<br>  <br>  None. A candidate's concession speech does not impact the States' duties and responsibilities related to the Electoral College system. On December 15, 2008, the electors will meet in each State to cast their ballots.<br>  <br>  <br>  I'd go for exactly the same I did the 1st time...

Oh, man.<br>  <br>  Your plan is anything but fool proof.  He's gonna know it was you who busted him.  I mean, you're locking him in the john!  And he's probably got something on you, too.  Besides, it's your residence, too, and you're up for possession.<br>  <br>  So let him make his own bed and let karma take care of it for you.  Bad stuff always comes back to bite you in the rear anyway.<br>  <br>  Edit:  BTW, just because you don't believe in something doesn't mean it doesn't exist.  I can not believe in racism either, but I know it's still out there.<br>  <br>  Can't you just be glad you had the good sense to get this jerk out of your life?<br>  <br>  And who knows, this guy might have a few "friends" who can do "favours" for him.

A felony just under murder class felonies...|`|usqiUOMxaa	The urine test would need to be court ordered, and he would have plenty of time to get clean.<br>  <br>  What state are you in?

Really it sounds like either he was sleeping with your girlfriend or you are a total d*****bag|`|CZlUhRfkaa	Not a good plan.  He can be as high as he wants in his own home.  If he realizes you've trapped him in the bathroom, he'll either smoke or flush whatever he has on him.  If the officers don't find anything else in the apartment, he gets off free.  Can't possess drugs.  Drugs already taken, don't count unless you are in public and causing a problem.  You've got to find the evidence in order to prosecute.  All this will do is make him mad.  Also keep in mind that if your name is still on a lease when you do this and the officers find drugs, you can be blamed as well if your roommate doesn't claim them!|`|kOsJ63KFaa	 You don't believe in Karma? Do you believe in getting your *** kicked and your teeth knocked out?  Mind your damm busineess. Besides your plan is a piece of ****. I could bust through a bathroom door in about half a second. And in California a ounce or less is no more than a traffic ticket, if even that. I can't stand people who get drunk and cause problems. But thats ok because it's legal right?  You seem like the biggest ***** in the world. Narcs like you are the low lifes. No one likes little narcs  anywhere not even in prison.|`|OhcsdKYLaa	weed smoking low life am I? <br>  'obey it like every other citizen'<br>  honey if you knew what the world was like then you would know that you are a rare occurrence. Most people dont obey this law.<br>  Just because we dont doesnt meant we are low lifes and I dont take kindly to be called that.<br>  <br>  You need to take a chill pill..<br>  <br>  how about talk to your room mate before you stick the police on him? <br>  It's what a decent person would do.  |`|HxKjAMk9aa	Your plan sucks. One you cant lock him in bathroom as you would then be violating the law and be arrested yourself. The police cannot enter the apartment without a warrant. The police cant just make somone supply a urine test. The old friedn could just flush the evidence so your plan isn't GOOD AT ALL. The best solution is to call the local police and report him, they will do the rest.|`|AA10065077	Instead of going through all that, when you move out make sure your name is off the lease then just tell the police of an illegal substance at your old address. Locking someone in the bathroom can be wrongful imprisonment and you can be arrested for it. |`|675390202407ced9223dcc6b917599d2aa	If you know about a crime and don't report it until it's "convenient" for you, doesn't that make you an accessory?  I would rather have more pot smokers in the world and fewer jerks like you...the world would be a much better place.  |`|9qJPfpRpaa	Seriously? Wow, way to be a jerk. Now, I admit I don't know the particulars, but this comes off as extremely and unflatteringly self-righteous. And I don't smoke weed, but again, way to be condescending and judgemental by assuming that all pot smokers are low-lives. Why should weed even be illegal?<br>  <br>  Edit: You know, to be perfectly honest, if I were your roommate I would probably give you crap too if you kept telling me every five minutes that I was a low-life. Which, given how you asked your question on here, strikes me as something you would do.|`|GMHERSExaa	It seems to me, you  are about causing more problems than anything. What has he done to you personally? Why would you go out of your way to turn him in? is this Russia or something. You should just walk away and leave him be, you are asking for nothing but bad Karma on yourself. Do you support people breaking the law? Like not stopping all the way at a light or stop sign? Illegal Aliens, Etc? Do you want someone turning you in? is that what you want our society to be? a bunch of cowards digging into other peoples business and calling the police? I think you have to much time on your hands, and you are asking for trouble. I don't smoke weed and never have, but I will tell you this though, If I had some person digging in my personal business and trying to turn me in for any violation, he wouldn't be safe. That's for sure. So my advice for you is to just walk away and forget about things, He will get busted on his own, why get in the middle of things anyway? Are you that bored, or have that much hate? if so get over it and move on!!!!

Me refiero a que respeto a una persona que se sacrifica por algo si realmente cree en lo que hace.<br>  <br>  Asi que, considero discutible el tema del progreso. <br>  <br>  Pero, considerándolo en si mismo, creo que es un resultado de la libertad y el uso de la razón y el debate, tal como se expresa desde el Iluminismo. Cualquier restricción a la libertad implica atrasos en la sociedad. Cualquier religión que niegue avances científicos y cambios a nivel social, y que intente contrarestrarlos en lugar de impulsarlos para mejor, da?a la sociedad.<br>  <br>  No vivo en una sociedad islámica; no puedo decir si es más da?ina en ese sentido. El cristianismo, por su parte, creo que se ha adaptado al capitalismo en la historia, pero con los cambios sociales actuales, su desactualizacion implica pérdida de vigencia.

tROFU72waa	An antimatter weapon is a hypothetical device using antimatter as a power source, a propellant, or an explosive for a weapon. Antimatter weapons do not currently exist as far as we know outside fiction (such as Star Trek's photon torpedo). The United States Air Force, however, has been interested in military uses—including destructive applications—of antimatter since the Cold War, when it began funding antimatter-related physics research. The primary theoretical advantage of such a weapon is that antimatter and matter collisons convert 100% of mass into energy while comparatively a fusion reaction in a hydrogen bomb is on the order of 0.7%.<br>  <br>  On March 24, 2004, Eglin Air Force Base Munitions Directorate official Kenneth Edwards spoke at the NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts[1]. During the speech, Edwards ostensibly emphasized a potential property of positron weaponry, a type of antimatter weaponry: Unlike thermonuclear weaponry, positron weaponry would leave behind "no nuclear residue", such as the nuclear fallout generated by the nuclear fission reactions which power nuclear weapons. According to an article in San Francisco Chronicle, Edwards has granted funding specifically for positron weapons technology development, focusing research on ways to store positrons for long periods of time, a significant technical and scientific difficulty.<br>  <br>  There is considerable skepticism within the physics community about the viability of antimatter weapons. According to an article on the website of the CERN laboratories, which produces antimatter on a regular basis, "There is no possibility to make antimatter bombs for the same reason you cannot use it to store energy: we can't accumulate enough of it at high enough density. (...) If we could assemble all the antimatter we've ever made at CERN and annihilate it with matter, we would have enough energy to light a single electric light bulb for a few minutes."[2]|`|25Cu0kjFaa	Currently, we can only make antimatter in tiny (read: a few hundred atoms at a time) amounts. But since the reaction of matter and antimatter is the most efficient release of energy known, any bomb using this would be devastating.<br>  <br>  For example, the M67 hand grenade, with 6.5oz of CompB filler, has a blast radius of 15 meters. A similarly sized antimatter grenade, with 3 ounces of antihydrogen, would have an explosive force of 200 kilotons. That's over ten times stronger than the bomb that leveled Hiroshima.|`|TMb076n6aa	I do know that nuclear bombs scare me this is the first I heard of this one.|`|bz6g1OcCaa	ok anti-matter is a very delicate substance.a paper clip amount of matter would create about a 15 mile radius of a crater.if you use about a computer size...well north korea is gone.a double bed could wipe out the US.a house well goodbye world.then only way to get anti-matter is to chemicaly alter then charactoristics of the material then just get matter and anti and ram the two together and BOOM!!|`|qIT2aTmVaa	I've yet to hear or read anything other than hypothetical theory of any anti-matter weapons.

Many weapons were developed to counter the human wave attacks of China. China might have a huge Army, but if we have weapons that can kill 10,000+ troops at a time.

TQYQUNYHaa	Obama is spending our monies and saying every thing is so bad but he is causing all this.  He is making it bad by his decisions and also people are having a lot of health problems.  People do not need more worry causing depression  and heart problems plus.  Obama said he would cut government jobs because government was too big but they said there would be an increase in government jobs.   We don't need this as they are always getting big raises and their health insurance is a plus for all of them.  They will not be on universal health which will have to be paid for one way or another by us.  They are like union jobs every thing goes with them like health insurance but Obama is pushing union jobs which the employees have to pay to to belong to and they want to see when these people vote which is wrong.  The small consumer is not getting enough help from the government and this the problem why they are going down.  Just step back and think that Obama has his thinking and promises all wrong.   This why the job market is so bad.   Obama must rethink what he is doing and who he is helping.  He is for big business with all his bail offs.  They did not help the air lines and they are still taking cuts to survive.  This country is turning into the way Obama wants it and rules it.  This the same thing going on in the states that survive.  The Democrats are all doing a bad job and they are our big problem and why Obama step in and is listening to them and is not checking their work line after line as promised.  He is wasting money and increasing carbon flying around the country promoting these plans.   He still is doing this as if this is election and he wouldn't even have town hall meetings with McCain and that's when he should have for us to get the right answers from him.

Honey, watch more of FOX, you'll start getting the real picture of what is going on in this administration. No, I didn't watch it, I only put CNN on when there is nothing else on to watch, like late Sunday afternoon. I know what you mean when you say he was "supposed" to win, I gotcha.|`|0ky4Ckf6aa	I will not let mt tv channel stop on that communist sh*t. I have it programed out of my tuner.
DICsYWpeaa	omg that's horrible!you need to get a lawyer and file a police report. it's a big deal if he said "drunk mexican" because that's a hate crime and he could get fired for that. seriously that's so wrong and the people at that hospital should have never spoken to you like that let alone ignore you. even if you were "actting like a child" that doesn't matter, nurses are there for YOU, it's their job to care even if they dont want to.<br>  <br>  in my opinion those people should be fired. those are the type of people we dont need working at a hospital. |`|kmCbvxHfaa	Do you have any names of there paramedics,doctors,or nurses? You need to get as much information about these people. Writng down what was said and done. You need to find someone who was with you who can testify on your behalf. Call the HR department of the hospital and the ambulance. Make sure you write the names down of all the people you talk to and what they say. Get your case together and call and lawyer ASAP. Completely unethical. |`|MpgfJCknaa	To answer your question you should hire a lawyer or talk to hospital administration if you dont want to go through the trouble of hiring an attorney right off the bat. Administration is usually pretty good at resolving issues. they dont want to open themselves up to lawsuits. But my question is why are you so worried about other people mistreating you when you do this to yourself. Honestly, how do you expect other people to respect you when you dont respect yourself. You set the example yourself.|`|IsqF5URVaa	first hand spitting into their face started a war they most likely felt you wasn't yourself and would even get more nastier with everything they had to do, as well felt they would have to use force to stop you from hurting someone.spitting is battery too you know.things they do don't always feel good as adults we should know it,as well bare it.|`|7wgVl7Sxaa	first do u have any proof?<br>  you were drunk so its a hard to believe story. <br>  If your mother witnessed this then thats good.<br>  <br>  you should speak with your lawyer.<br>  or speak with the Hospitals complaint department.<br>  No one deserves to be treated like that.<br>  and visit a clinic for your pain and have them write it all down so you also have evidence from your doctor.|`|AA10287033	Well, not to sound rude. But maybe you should not be drinking.....drunk people are a bit of a pain to deal with. You might have been doing things that are very annoying. Not that I am saying they did not act unprofessional, but maybe you should give your actions a bit of thought. <br>  <br>  |`|88581cf566c30acddb7ffe0f4e82d631aa	You need to contact an attorney, most of them offer free consultation.  If a lawyer takes the case you could sue the ambulance co, the hosp., and the police...  good luck|`|Kkns9lOraa	You should have asked for the Social Services Department to send a Patient Advocate immediately.  |`|sLF8jaLtaa	Yeah you were mistreated. You should get a lawyer.|`|JgElo7rcaa	Yes, you where mistreated...on the other hand, how can SO many officials have been wrong and a drunk been right?  BTW...why are you drinking if you're a diabetic?  BIG NO-NO!  Alcohol turns to pure sugar when processed by the body, which is part of why people get hang overs!  EITHER WAY ~ They where wrong to insult you and in the long run, if I were drunk and someone insulted me I too would be a bit hard to handle!!!  Try a Lawyer (pro bono).|`|H7SQEM4Daa	Sounds like you can't remember your bad behavior,only that of the other people involved. <br>  Being HIV positive,you could be charged with assault for spitting on the paramedic. <br>  My guess would be that your behavior was enough to cause concern in the ER and you were cuffed for either your own protection or that of others.<br>  Drinking while being a diabetic is not the smartest thing to do. <br>  You put yourself in this situation and will have a hard time proving that you were the innocent victim.|`|3af30c08175e2bc96bcd85540e09d175aa	How drunk were you? People who are quite inebriated tend to not fully remember everything, nor are they in complete control over their actions. A friend of mine got very drunk and thought she was gently placing her head on the table, but she was actually bashing her head into the table.<br>  <br>  Do you have any witnesses that can tell you what really happened? Otherwise, at least go to a doctor so that your injuries are recorded. If you injuries are serious, get a lawyer, but I hope you have witnesses because you were drinking.|`|x81bKkFqaa	It might be harder to prove your case since you were drinking at the time, even if you were mistreated, I would call a lawyer for at least legal advice.|`|SxAOmZJnaa	Good luck being drunk at the time and having no evidence to support you will kill your case.|`|yUXJ8i7Naa	that is so horrible and I am so sorry to hear that.. i would never treat a patient like that.. get a lawyer.. file a lawsuit|`|VCrg58H5aa	i am a nurse at a hospital and it sounds like your were defiantly treated wrongly!!!!   You have a case on your hand i would get a layer and have them call OSHA and see where your layer wants to go from there.  As someone in the medical field a person of this status should never judge or mistreat a patient for there race, gender, or sickness's.|`|AA10065077	I'm so sorry for you. First, contact the hospital's complaint dept. go to a clinic to get medical evidence, and then get a lawyer. I'm sorry if I sound rude, but sometimes when people come drunk we don't treat right away just to see if time solves the problem. If you brought by ambulance then there is no reason that someone should not have been in room right away.|`|E87JwnACaa	if you were drinking and are diabetic, you probably were acting belligerant without knowing it.<br>  <br>  Maybe you weren't being attended because they were seeing if time would correct the problem(s).<br>  <br>  If you are diabetic and drinking, you are six kinds of stupid anyway, or else attempting suicide -- and that doesn't even take inro consideration any other health problems.|`|LggMpuQIaa	You need to call the hospitals complaint department. NO ONE deserves to be treated like that. |`|z74BXkhSaa	this is awful and i totally believe you on this. first off, you need to contact you an attorney and give all of these details and find an attorney who will accept this case and then take it from there. good luck|`|Gdhts726aa	oh my god you really were mistreated! honestly i say you hire an attorney. preferably one that is specialized in medical cases. do it soon!|`|0a63bea93936ab0ee524797cc7e2695daa	You were being drunk and out of control which is a potential danger to everyone who is treating you.

Its natural, its healthier than alcohol and cigarettes, you can still function on it, it is expensive to try to inforce, the gov. can tax it and make a sh*tload of $$$$$, many other reasons...but i think that it should have some restrictions, like driving, and age limitations, similar to alcohol...but i'm all for it! go take a bong rip!<br>  <br>  oh yea, make the age limit 18 and lower the friggin drinking age!!!! peace!|`|8zHRlvH6aa	Hells yeah....|`|9z5YJKqLaa	no|`|nr3sm3u5aa	yes i think it should|`|uJDPFp1Raa	Absolutely!

KHeR3hGIaa	Age of consent in New York is 17.<br>  <br>  Sounds like statutory rape to me ...<br>  <br>  Though really, you might want to start by talking to a lawyer.  If the guy is going to get hit with a statutory rape charge, that will reduce his ability to pay any sort of child support, and so it would be best avoided if possible.  Perhaps that can be avoided, yet you still file for child support if it's done in a certain way?  A lawyer would know what to do ...<br>  <br>  (I'm assuming that you don't want the guy going to jail.  Well, even if you do, talk to a lawyer -- don't get your legal advice on Yahoo Answers.)|`|DLvHWOo7aa	Look up Age of Consent laws for your state. <br>  <br>  If you are above the age of consent statutory rape need not apply. It varies from state to state, some are 16 some are 14|`|pAqfWJ8Haa	nope   getting technical as you state ..in any country in the world and every type of jurisdiction in the world on any given day there are many thousands of men exactly 18 years old plus 1 day and many thousands of girls exactly 16 years and nine months old....it is never illegal to be exactly 1 year nine months  and a day older/younger than anybody else....isn't that ACTUALLY what you have asked ???|`|UaoRoGUFaa	I believe the legal age of consent in New York state is 17 years of age, so yes it is considered Statutory Rape.|`|epbzW5N8aa	Think of the child having a better life, not some looser.

3CoHM0NJaa	You are screened by the court to determine whether you are eligible to sit on a jury, for example are you the correct age, do you live in the jurisdiction etc. <br>  <br>  Then you are usually given a questionnaire and asked to respond to some questions verbally by the attorney's This process is known as Voir Dire. The attorneys, in consultation with the judge,  then determine if you can sit on the jury in that particular case. <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|eulMjLtPaa	You are not selected for jury duty due to a questionnaire; you are called in from a random draw from voter registration and DMV lists. <br>  <br>  The judge does not "screen" you.  <br>  <br>  Once you have reported for duty, if you are called into the jury box, then it is time for voir dire, where both the prosecution and defense attorneys will ask either general ("have any of you...") or specific ("Mrs. Smith, can you tell me...") questions.  <br>  <br>  They will determine from the way you answer the questions whether or not they want you on the jury, i.e. who would be best for their case.  There's sometimes no rhyme nor reason why you're excused, and they don't tell you why.|`|Qou0CLwiaa	not the judge, actually the opposing lawyers interview the candidates. the process is called "voir dire", you can google the rest :)|`|AA10065077	First you are issued a questionare. Answer the questions honestly. Then if you are selected you will be issued a jury summons telling you to come to court on a certain date. Both the defence and prosecution attornies will ask you questions. At this point you can also asked to be excused for whatever reason. You will then know if you are accepted on to the jury.|`|Ay5HrCTeaa	The Judge

But kept us safe for 7 years. Kept the economy moving forward to over 14000 on the DOW until this downturn(but nobody wants to acknowledge that point). He was able to have a successful economy in the middle of two wars and a big hurricane because of the conservative parts of his polices. He messed when he appeased the left with moderate liberal policies like the giant bailout. But all in all president Bush was a true red white and blue American and proud of his country. I just feel like president Obama has a chip on his shoulder and has something to prove regardless of the consequences of his actions. We need a Reagan in 2012 to return our country to the greatness it once was..|`|SBOCFuAlaa	Bush was a Oil man and a Crook, I see no way how they compare.|`|9zTbeTshaa	He is not anything like Bush, thank goodness.

AA10065077	First call the credit card companies and tell them get the addresses from them that the person was using from the credit card companies. Then you need to go to the DA with this information. You shouldn't be held responsible for the charges, but it will hurt your credit score. After this, make sure you shred or burn any junk mail you recieve. You are also going to have to rebuild your credit. To do this get a secured credit card. That is you pay money first, then whatever you payed you have for credit. Make sure that you pay your bill on time each month.

Most places do this by the time clock or in the break room, if you have either. Federal law says it should be in there somewhere where you can see it. Try the website below.|`|AA10065077	Managers and bosses should act professional. Unfortunately for you there probably isn't a code of conduct written in stone.

8hAhmlJjaa	Sorry to tell you this, but once you were out of the house, the current owner/resident has the right to change the locks.  If you change the locks back without permission it is breaking and entering, a crime.  Also, anything you left behind when you left is considered abandoned property.  The new owner/resident can throw it out, put it at the curb, give it to charity, or take it as their own.  You need a court order to prevent this.  Contact a lawyer.|`|AA10065077	Sorry to hear of your situation. Anyway this is the law once you have moved out or evicted you have 30 days to make arrangements with the property owner or their agent to get your personal property. Unfortunately, you waited to long so you get back whatever it is they feel like giving back to you. At the end of the day how do you know what's yours and what isn't yours. Did you put your name on things and save receipts? If not then legally you have no claim. You could be charged with breaking and entering. I know this sucks, but the law is suppose to protect.|`|lpRT2lhmaa	You changing locks when you are not living there certainly is not legal. Technically you could be charged with breaking and entering or burglary. When you left and didn't return for your property for a few months you abandoned it, and really have no claim to it.|`|1c435IVFaa	You moved out and the locks were changed. When you entered the property and changed the locks, you broke the law. As unfair as this may seem to you, it is the law. You could have been charged with simple burglary in an inhabited dwelling and theft of goods. |`|oHs8RzVCaa	It is difficult to understand what you are saying.  You said that you moved out and left your stuff at your grandfather's home.  When you returned, you found that the locks were changed.  You in turn changed the locks again.<br>  <br>  Let's stop there for a moment.  You moved out.  What responsibility does he have for your stuff?  None.  You have to make arrangements.  The law doesn't require people to hang on to your stuff hoping that you will return one day -- a month, year, decade, or century later.  What authority do you have to change the lock to his property?  There are several crimes involved here -- burglary, damage to property among others.  <br>  <br>  Moving along...  Who is your uncle's solicitor?  What does your uncle have to do with your grandfather's property?  You have to explain.  <br>  <br>  Unless you own that property, you have no legal right to change locks or throw a fit about them bagging your stuff up for you.
AA10065077	They don't kick you out they will give you a medical discharge. If you were diagnosed with emphysema you would be medically discharged it's not a dishonorable discharge it's just saying that you're not well. That would only happen if you were not getting better during treatment. The military would have to treat you as long as you didn't have the diagnoses before you enlisted. That is true no matter what disease you mention.  While you are waiting for your paperwork they might make you do skunk work like cleaning the bathrooms (the head) and anything else they can think of. More than likely you will be mistreated 'till your paperwork goes through. Once you are discharged you can continue treatment through the vetren's adminastration.|`|b73bda331fdfa778ce67f7c1e95159e5aa	It depends on the disease - mostly whether you can be maintained in combat ready status, and whether it's a danger to others in the service.<br>  <br>  HIV is an instant out - the military is its own blood bank and will not tolerate blood borne illnesses.  It's likely to get you a general discharge, but that would depend on the details.<br>  <br>  Emphysema would net a discharge, or limited duty - depending on the severity and how much treatment it requires.  Again, much might depend on the details of the individual situation.|`|2iqSofzYaa	they kicked my cousin out, cause she had a bad asthma attack, she hadn't had one since she was 4 and had forgotten about it... she was home in about 2 weeks after that.|`|gz5O9Tbpaa	Oh yes!! If you contract HIV or any other incurable disease they will discharge you in a heartbeat!<br>  <br>  I've seen it happen!|`|mbbVnQa3aa	If it was found out that you had HIV they would kick you out instantly.  Im not sure what discharge you would get, but it would most likely me a medical discharge.  There are certain illnesses you can get a waiver for if it is deemed that it the illness does not pose a risk and you could function in without problems.|`|38b2c1e5018b7aac3971646357619a77aa	Well, I have seen two things happen depending on the severity of the illness. They could assign you to a light duty station for the remainder of your enlistment or they could give you a medical discharge that would be honorable.  If you have the hiv, you will get processed out very quickly b/c you would be a liability.|`|8xCzgkY0aa	Last I heard, there was not a cure for the HIV.  So no they are not going to treat you for that.  However if it is something that is curable, they will help you get better before they discharge you.  If it is not a quick fix, they will guide you to a VA Hospital|`|x3O9ed3Kaa	you would most likely get medically discharged for the HIV and possibly get medical pay for contracting breathing problems on duty|`|qngNLLxnaa	Hnmmm well I've heard of them keeping the people on and treating them but I've heard they discharging them more often thananything else|`|AA10709853	HIV is an immediate discharge.   they cannot run the risk of you spreading it.  <br>  <br>  Emphysema is iffy.. they would treat you, but after a certain time frame they would have no other option but to discharge you if you do not improve or become World Wide deployable.  |`|9rhmeb7raa	They would treat you. If your condition didn't improve enough to resume full duty you would be either medically discharged or be placed on the disability retired list.  Of course this would only cover those conditions which did not exist prior to enlistment. In those cases you are given a general discharge under honorable conditions.
080ab6bf2e027cac54962d7da686995faa	Yes your friend is committing fraudulent enlistment.  He will eventually be discovered, someone my husband new in basic had a similar situation, eventually it was discovered, he was pulled out of basic charged with fraudulent enlistment.  What happened to him after that I do not know.  I do know that his recruiter was also charged with covering it up (it was the same recruiter as my husband), he was kicked out of the military.<br>  <br>  I would tell him to he honest, they are overlooking a lot these days but how much they will overlook who knows.  Especially since he has learning disabilities, I don't know how much testing he has already gone through or evauluation.  But lying about this stuff makes it worse when it's discovered.  And it will be discovered.|`|2zhQznahaa	you don't need a super brilliant mind when signing for the army: its not like you have to be a propulsion or atomic scientist....  He's not really lying too bad.  I dont like you for the fact, one of my old laundromat cleaners- he was going to join into the military and wasn't a genius, but I didn't search around on some Y!A dweebing on him, telling ppl that he was in a bad spot for trying to join the army and not being brilliant.  Alot of people with like 32 or 34 on their Asvab do try and get in here (a battery to test your functioning)<br>  <br>  You dont have to be a genius, and also, its bad - AND discouraged to lie about your former experimental drug use.   Its not going to be an end to the world that this guy gets in.  Maybe he's trying to escape a bad life from whatever town you live in.|`|57N8Ls5Oaa	The Army will take anybody.  |`|7GSOlDgwaa	There is not many people that are qualified to be in the military in every way. Everybody has some aches or pains and they aren't perfect like the military wants. Recruiters regularly instruct the recruits to lie to meps, it happens all the time. If a person does drugs, a recruiter will most likely supply them with a substance to pass a meps drug test. The point is that most people actually lie in some way to get into the military. 1 in 4 adults suffer from a diagnosable mental illness at any given time. yeah, and none of them are in the military yeah right. all kinds of screwed up people find there way into the military., its a fact of life that people have problems.|`|SOTzQwJaaa	No, they will just not allow him to join.  If he does get in it may catch up to him and they probably will out-process him from the Army.|`|AA10065077	Well, First it's kind of like you applying for a job. Yes, it is a crime to lie on an application. Most of the time the employer just doesn't hire you and not press charges.  The things you mention are things most people lie about. As long as his urine sample is clean there is nothing to worry about there. About not being allowed into ROTC did he lie or just not mention it? With the learning disability thing you have take an ASvAP test and score at least an 80 before they will let you start basic training. He also needs to take and pass a psychology test. So, with everything that I just mentioned your friend might not get enlisted. If your friend does get enlisted and they find out he lied he could face a dishonorable discharge and charged even if he wasn't enlisted they can still file charges. You don't lie to the govornment.
kQt4ub3Daa	<br>     No, the government agency itself must own, operate, and maintain all equipment in, and the vehicle, and if that officer ever transferred to another department the paperwork would be an absolute nightmare.<br>  <br>     Not to mention converting the equipment to operate in another area and district. It's also illegal for an Officer to have this equipment in another location / area / jurisdiction, and family vacations or personal out of town trips would violate that law.<br>  <br>     The other reason is because the Officer is allowed to take a company car home if he is in an on-calll situation, and they also couldn't verify gas receipts and usage for company time or personal time.<br>  <br>     The car could be sold to the Department though, if they have any interest in buying it or a purpose for it. Say a collectible model used for PR purposes (Anniversary edition pace car, etc). But it's VERY rare that they'd buy anything from 1995, especially with the newest police package engine and drivetrain requirements.<br>  <br>  <br>                   Good Luck!.<br>  |`|Y3KvEOXJaa	Nope.  It has to be a government issued vehicle.|`|tn2ur8vOaa	No stupid question.......Do not, I repeat, customize your Eclipse. I had a 96 turbo and did 2 things: Cold Air intake and exhaust and the car could not stop breaking down all the time. When I revved it up over 3k the engine would break the hydrolic clutch line disabling the car......|`|AA10065077	The only way for that to be legal is if the agency owned the car. Then you could only drive it for business use.
48acf9585e24591f1ae712f47be9e050aa	Are you sure you got ticketed for running the red light?  It is not illegal in CA to enter an intersection when the light is yellow.  It is, however, illegal to enter an intersection if you cannot proceed through it (the anti-gridlock law), which is what this sounds like.  Were you cited for violating VC 22526?

ab0507069beb3cfdfdcee35075af07feaa	My friend, ...the retired Chief Petty Officer in me wants to chew on your *** untill it's soft enough to blow bubble gum. But, ..I will refrain from that kind of exchange at this time.<br>  <br>  **BIG SIGH** There is no way for you to get out of the Navy now, at least not and have your civilian life to go back to. To get out, you would have to commit some sort of felonious act or smoke dope, both of which will result in a bad conduct discharge, which will follow you for the rest of your life. You would have to list it on every job application you fill out from now until the day you die.<br>  <br>  For God's sake, ...you're only in "A" school. Put your head down and get through it! Are you a man or a boy? If "A" school is too much stress, then tell your instructor you want to DOR (Drop on Request) and go straight to the fleet! Boot camp and "A" school are not the Navy, ...the fleet is. Maybe you'd be happier as an undesignated seaman striking for a rate instead of going through "A" school. I know "A" school is a lot of inspections and studying, yada, yada, yada. To be truthful I didn't like "A" school when I went through it in 1982, but I got through it because I knew the fleet would be better. And it was. Just suck 'em up like you have a pair and get through your "A" school. Do your contracted time in the Navy and THEN get out if you want. Finish what you started, like a man would. Because I'll be honest with you, ...anoyne who comes to me for a job interview (I'm a senior manager in the company I work for) who it turns out walked away from their commitment to the military won't be in the interview for long, and won't get the job either. If you can't hack it in the military where you DON'T have a choice, how long will you work for me when you DO have a choice and things get a little hectic? Think before you act, ...the rest of your life is at stake. And don't listen to those people that will tell you it's not the end of the world; that people like Walt Disney had dishonorable Discharges from the military and it didn't stop them. They're right, it didn't stop them from becoming successful, but it sure made the path to glory a long and difficult one.|`|AA10709853	you cannot just quit, you signed a contract and now you are obligated to serve that contract.   the QUICKEST way is to finish your contract.  |`|rYNM67oyaa	Get used to it. Life in general is full of stress. Are you going to run away from it every time it comes around?|`|tn2ur8vOaa	Pu$$y. It is the Navy not like you are in the marines or Army. Stress? What stress? You get 3 meal a day and get to share a bunk with another sailor and sail around the world trapped on a ship saving all that great pay. Get over it and grow a set and stop being a little sissy boy. Navy boot camp tough that is the first time I have ever heard that......I can not stop crying this is too funny.......BTW I am a Army vet who felt boot camp was to soft and I am not hardcore or anything with discipline..<br>  <br>  <br>  Do you have money? I mean a lot of money? They will charge you for boot camp all the costs and it is around 250k.<br>  Do not tell them you are gay they will ask you to prove it.|`|AA11091599	Hi Craker, what A school are you in? Have you tried talking to a chaplain? Is is just the coursework that's stressing you &/or the lifestyle? How much longer is your A school? Just tough it out while you're in A school, even if you fail, they'll just reassign you. You do not want a dishonorable discharge!!!!|`|AA10065077	Come up with a reason to medically discharged.  Or instead injure yourself so you can't do whatever is stressing you out. I've heard C school is better. So, you just have to get passed this A school thing. Take a horrible fall. That way you won't be able to do anything.|`|Gy7FsoxUaa	The military is not for all. At least you gave it a try. Please see a lawyer and he /she will help you get out. Then go on to college and show the world you can do well. Good luck.|`|1X1NgAJwaa	I've been researching, my friend. <br>  The most important thing is you DONT TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER. now, i'm not sayin just go up and say i want out. no matter what. <br>  you've got to be covert but make sure you are persistant in your reasoning and determination to get out. Now, if you can arrange something with a friend or family member; you can tell your commander that close relative or friend is terminally ill and might not have very long to live and you'd like to spend the remaining time with them. <br>  here is a list of things you might casually mention but don't just list them off and say you want out. <br>  you don't feel morally obligated to complete the terms of the contract<br>  you are the sole surviving son in your family<br>  inability to adjust/cope with the social, mental and physical demands of the military<br>  family hardships<br>  you want to persue an education...<br>  maybe "don't ask, don't tell"  tell them you;re a homo<br>  if all else fails then educate yourself on the new world order and tell them you don't want to be a slave to the corporate owners and bankers who fund(through the taxpayers of course) and run these wars.<br>  and if that fails you know they can't do much with a 350 pound man|`|0bY6w1Otaa	you shoulda done it in boot.<br>  <br>    theres a few ways out  tell them your gay or act crazy like all paranoid and ****.  dont just stop following orders cause they'll send you to mast or do  do that and they'll kick you out with an other than honorable.<br>  <br>    i tried to grt out when i was in by getting drunk n fightin but it didn't work.<br>       if you have a c - school next you oughta stay in cause they aint teachin u squat  in A are they?  but i feel it was all worth it in the long run.. free medical the rest o your life.    good luck!|`|GyoSw18haa	You dont want a dis-honorable discharge! that will effect any job you ever apply for.

RetjXEmmaa	Do a bit of volunteer work - maybe with the CFA, or SES. I have never done the OSB for pilots, but if its anything like the usual OSB make sure you know your job. The OSB is where you will really be put under the job. DFR (Defence Force Recruiting) will give you access to all the info you need - but dont be afraid to show some initiative and learn extra info. Present confidently; know your own motivations. <br>  <br>  Oh.. and practice your off-the-cuff oral presentations ;)|`|AA10065077	Get good grades. Also do a little research on the types of planes. That way you won't sound like an idiot talking to them. Also try to make a name for yourself through extra activities.
Gj0zOqTyaa	Then not much would happen seeing as we are allies.<br>  <br>  And Area-51 is an aircraft testing place...<br>  <br>  And it would hardly be a secret, it would be all over the news.<br>  <br>  And also, seeing as the British Empire was the largest empire that ever existed I think being more powerful than ever would make us ridiculously amazing.  As we are now ;-)|`|AA10065077	Don't worry the intellegent life that's at Area 51 would be able to build weapons to take care of the british empire.|`|RbCvbkRcaa	you must define word empire as the U.K giving more of its over seas territories away and take century's to rebuild like the old one
BVJBY4eQaa	If you have been sold the couch as leather and it isn't then you will have a case.  It would be wise to have the 'leather' tested to make sure what it is.  If you need it testing contact Leatherwise in the UK, they can do this for you.  Coatings on leather can be very deceptive and in some cases  it will be the thickness of the coating that determines whether or not it can be sold as leather. (Laws vary from country to country)<br>  Hope this helps|`|AA10065077	Are you sure it isn't leather? You could try dealing with the store you bought it from and inform them and give them a chance to make it right. If they totally ignore you could take them to court because it is false advertising. It's not even that it could be viewed as a scam. If you think about it, you buy something that says Gucci, the dealer tells you it's Gucci, charges you the Gucci price, then you find out it isn't Gucci. Chances are that's not the case. There was just some mixup.
ZzHE0lvtaa	I don't know about talking on a cell phone being a felony but they definitely need to make some harsh laws about texting and enforce them.  I am almost 40 years old and I text a lot and used to do it while driving until I almost hit a car head on running about 65 miles an hour.  I never thought about it much until then but really you just space out when your texting.  I know I will never drive and text again and I have told my kids not to either, I just hope they listened to me.  I just wonder how they could prove a driver was texting though, it is usually done to where it is not visible, don't know if it would work.|`|kOsJ63KFaa	 It will take a bunch of traffic accident fatalities, then law makers will maybe do something. Thats a big maybe. You have to realize a felony conviction will destroy someones life in many ways. Is that what you want? I would like a law to beat, drag, hang, and kill everyone who abuses animals, but that's not going to happen. niether is your nazi idea.|`|AA10065077	You need to make it law. To do that you have to write to your congress Representatives. As far as talking on a cell phone, I don't care as long as the person can still drive. It's almost like listening to the radio. I don't like it when people text. Texting requires way to much attention especially if you still have the old style phones where you have to use the number keys. |`|bbf8f564d5e1675db8cb7cbcc84b0bebaa	I'm fed up with this behavior and line of thinking which proposes making everyone a felon.<br>  There are already a plethora of laws which deal with injuring another person by whatever means whether it be planned action, negligence, or even accidental. Why is that these are not enough? What does punishing someone who may have, possibly, somehow potentially hurt someone accomplish, besides obviously trying to make everyone a criminal?<br>  <br>  <br>  "It will be of little avail to the people that the laws are made by men of their own choice if the laws be so voluminous that they cannot be read, or so incoherent that they cannot be understood; if they be repealed or revised before they are promulgated, or undergo such incessant changes that no man, who knows what the law is today, can guess what it will be tomorrow." - James Madison|`|98a5c705254e76745e000a1bd7e067edaa	Yes, we need more people in Prison. And more ex-felons.
WjhsK7qSaa	You have the right ot say whatever you want without the fear of punishment. If you acted on what you said that is a different. Most people don't remember what the first amendment says. If you have a lawyer ask them about it. I got out of threating a guy by using the 1st amendment. good luck|`|AA10065077	As long as you don't violate the order you won't have a problem. When you go to court make sure that you print out the facebook page just to prove it was the mom that started it. Also you never know what the girl and the mom are doing and what kind of witnesses they can dig up. Remember, if a judge thinks you are threating enough for a restraining order who knows how threating they will think you are.
f0duMdXkaa	I cannot give you legal advice, but I can tell you that every state has a Child Protective agency that can address this issue.  If you believe that the child is in danger you can also go to your local police department and tell them of your fears and request a welfare check on the child.  If the police find dangerous conditions most states mandate that the child be removed by law enforcement.  I have heard that many states would prefer that a child be placed with caring relatives who can provide and are willing to love a child on a permanent bases rather than place a child in foster care.|`|AA10065077	The only way to get custody would be for social services to give it to you. There would have to be a case of abuse. If your sure then call the police. You also need to consider the fact that the child could go live the boyfriend's parents.|`|KJDvWqbhaa	talk to a CPS agent so that they can help you, they will investigate him and will determine that the child is better with you and not safe with the father.|`|rAPLZtvPaa	yes u can if show proof that he is a bad person to take care of the child..u could get the child under ur custody & plus hes not the real father of her
PHqj7owIaa	I don't get it. It sounds like she was giving him blank checks and then she decided she wasn't happy with the amount? <br>  <br>  If that is the case, I'm not sure if this would work, but it may be worth a shot. Your friend's mother needs to get an attorney to represent her. Under certain circumstances she may be able to get a court appointed attorney. She can plead the fifth - basically saying she cannot testify as she would be incriminating herself. She will then be taken before the judge is closed court - no records available to anyone - and tell the judge that she did give her son the checks to write in the amount and thus filed a false police report and would be incriminating herself. The judge will then decide that she cannot testify against her son. <br>  <br>  Now, if there is evidence to suggest that her son did indeed write checks for amounts that he was not supposed to, then there's not much she can do. She filed a complaint, she did not press the charges and thus cannot drop them. Most charges work that way. It is the DA who charges people, not citizens. <br>  <br>  I know that the charges sound like a lot, but that's because they have a hard time making any stick. I totally get what you mean by the trumped up charges, but that's the way the law works these days. Anything and everything that can be applied to a crime will be. Chances are if he is convicted, it will not be on all of them. |`|vFvI16P7aa	Unless she flat out falsified reports that she gave to the police, I can't see her being arrested.  I'm assuming she gave a copy of the forged check to the police as evidence?  That in itself can lead to all those charges you mentioned (in my state elder abuse also is a charge for taking advantage of an elderly person, which this case fits; it doesn't have to be physical or neglect).  You never said that he DIDN'T forge the check, you just added in other things that gave him some right to the account.  She should be able to drop the charges no problem, it's her account, she is the victim.  In my state the only thing that would keep her from dropping charges is that the elder abuse charge is domestic related.  In my state, the state takes over prosecution for all domestic abuse related cases, no matter what the victim wants to do.  If she doesn't get answers from the police officer, she needs to call the prosecuting attorney's office.|`|AA11327241	Usually the DA ( district attorney) will file charges against a person after the police have investigated and gathered evidence that a crime has been committed. This case seems like there was a lot of misunderstandings and hurt feelings and unless you live in a small town with not much for the DA to do, dropping charges would not get you in trouble. However if the wheels of justice have spun to a certain point it may be too late to stop the machinery of justice.  Also, the DA may act in the interest of the people and move forward with the case if he decides your friend is a danger to the community even if the complaining party wishes to drop the charges.  The Mother may chose to drop the case for almost any reason with out penalty however, if she did lie to the police they could charge her with a misdemeanor making a false police report, but then again the DA would have to make the time to prosecute and may decide it's just not worth the effort.<br>  <br>  If the mother wants to be absolutely sure she won't be arrested she can call the DA directly or hire a lawyer in inquire on her behalf.|`|AA10065077	The only way for your friend to get arrested would be providing false statements to the police.

KLFpzHc5aa	There might be a second stimulus package, but I am not sure if that will only be an extension for unemployment insurance and an incentive for small businesses. There might be no check at all. |`|rJLeVoMKaa	I do not like the idea of the government giving stimulus checks because it makes people dependent on them to supplement their lifestyle and it causes the national debt to raise even more.  <br>  <br>  I think America's indebtness will ultimately weaken our position in the world, which is a shame because we have done so many good things-but the world fails to understand it.<br>  <br>  I support our troops.  I think as a conservative that it is time to bring them home because we need to solve problems in our nation.  <br>  <br>  Before we do anything, we need to pray to GOD (Jesus) for wisdom.|`|XzsmYWOqaa	I hope so!  How am I gonna spend it?  I'm gonna book myself a nice vacation to the Mexican Riviera.  Too much bad news going on in the USA right now.  I need a nice get-away!|`|AA10065077	There's talk about it. I highly doubt it our government is to busy bailing out companies|`|UPuTUVrRaa	I don't know yet, as far as I know they are still just talking about it.  It would be nice though.|`|kIlUcxFRaa	i hope so|`|rpAQVezDaa	From rumor (haven't read up on it) My sister in law said she heard Obama say if there isn't one brought up before he is in office, there will be on after he is in office. And they said he said something like "Families don't need enough to catch them up, they need enough to catch them up and then have some spending money!" so I'd assume it'd be substantially larger than the last one. 
AA10939092	Its easy to get a fake or borrowed SS#. Then you work some place that doesnt check a lot. Then when they get the notice from the IRS about SS mismatch, they move on. <br>  IMHO - There should be a reward for turning in illegals, Say, $1000.00 each. The illegal problem would dissapear quite quickly. <br>  I also believe that anchor babies should not be allowed. IE if you and your partner are illegal and you have a kid here.. the kid should be illegal too. <br>  Also, we should have a national ID card. Make it impossible to rent a house, buy a car, or open a bank account w/o it. <br>  And make illegal immigration punishment the same as in Mexico IE 10 years in lock up, take all your assets.|`|G2auAv1Saa	<a href="http://www.immigrantrights.org/news062104.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.immigrantrights.org/news06210...</a><br>  <br>  Many cities turn a blind eye that they are there and have even passed laws protecting them. |`|WBwlKbLeaa	Many illegals are in people's faces everyday and are not scared about deportation because they know it won't happen.

I.D. theft is fairly easy, and frankly, until the Real I.D. moved into place, the illegal aliens could use one fake I.D. until they wanted to move on, and then pick up another for the next place they lived.  Further, if they had three fake I.D.s, and lived near the state line, they could establish apartments in two cities in different states, and collect welfare in both states.  Nice huh.. And you wonder why they are fighting to stop all this effort to send them home.<br>  <br>  Any big park in Mexico... the Mexican Mafia sold three I.D.s for $1,500 and you used one for welfare here.. one for welfare there.. and the third one was used when you were driving around.. traveling.  Them boys should have been tour arrangers.<br>  <br>  Finally, since 1987 the biggies have been doing polls on the illegal aliens.  Until the illegal aliens started voting in the polls, the numbers were 80+% wanted them deported, some didn't know, and a few wanted them to remain.  That has dropped now to 68+% want them deported.  Today.. right now.. the American People want the illegal aliens deported, and the number of immigrants reduced very significantly.|`|AA10065077	Some of these people came her legally with Visas and the Visas just expired and they didn't bother getting a green card.

If it is a small claims then she can go down to the court house and file a suit on her own.

They will know what to look for and note certain things that would indicate fault.  They may not, in most places you have to report an accident within 10 days if there is no injuries.<br>  <br>  If you have not done so yet, contact your insurance also, they don't want to pay damages so they will contact the other insurance company.  <br>  <br>  Take photo's, lots, when you think you have enough, take a few more.  What you want to accomplish is look for indications of direction of travel in the damage such as folds in the metal, and paint transfer that will show the color of the other vehicle.<br>  <br>  All is not lost, having the police involved would have made part of it easier but it doesn't mean your out of luck.  When you go by the police department if they can't help ask if they have a form that citizens can fill out for accidents not investigated by police, in Texas we call it a blue form, you may not be able to file it because of the time lapse but it will show you all the information you need to gather that will make a good court case.  If your sister wears a pair of short shorts when she goes in, some young unattached officer might trip all over himself to go out in the parking lot and help her fill it out and take the photo's.<br>  <br>  If all else fails, write the person a demand letter, don't use threatening or harassing language or anything, just state the fact that if you don't hear anything from him within 10 days you are going to start suit in small claims court, send it certified mail, return receipt requested, keep a copy of the letter you sent for presentation in court and anything else he sends back to you. if you don't hear from him file in small claims court, you'll have to pay a small filing fee but you can get it back.  It's an informal court and the clerk can assist you in filing.  If he doesn't show up in court you'll get a default judgment.<br>  <br>

AA11494150	You can discuss this with the prosecutor, but it will ultimately be his decision.<br>  <br>  If this is a domestic case, it is very unlikely charges will be dropped. It is common for abused women to change their minds, only to be abused more severely in the future. Therefore, most states aggressively pursue charges, regardless of the cooperation from the victim.|`|l4DIIB7waa	Trooper 3 is right.  You are subject to your own criminal charges if you filed a false police report or gave false testimony at the preliminary examination.  Careful!|`|RD5sTZaFaa	You are not pressing charges, the district attorney is pressing charges, it is the job of the state to enforce laws of the state.  If you feel that the charges should not be made then you may tell the prosecuting attorney.  You should also tell the attorney for the person who you charged.  <br>  <br>  Prosecutors are supposed to let the defense attorney know when the complaining witness wants to stop a prosecution, but the don't always do so.  If you need to go to the court and look at the court file to find out the name and phone number of the defense attorney then you are allowed to do so.<br>  <br>  The prosecution may or may not eventually dismiss the charge.  They are entitled to have the case presented to the jury if they really feel that there was a crime committed.  You can be forced to come to court to testify, and if you ignore a supbeona you can be brought to court in custody.<br>  <br>  If you have to testify you will have an opportunity to let the jury know why you called the cops when there was not really a crime.<br>  <br>  It is not a crime to tell the police something, even if you are mad, which is not true.  It is very often true that  the cops will put words into the mouth of the complaining witness.  They hear the same story so often that the officers can make mistakes and often do.  It is a crime to lie on the witness stand.  It would be worse to let an innocent person go to jail for a crime they didn't comit.<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  FIND OUT THE NAME AND PHONE NUMBER OF HE DEFENSE ATRTORNEY, AND CALL THAT PERSON, DON'T WAIT UNTIL HIS NEXT COURT DATE.

But you mentioned that you gave them another number? Next time they call, give them the number and ask to talk to a supervisor (be very nice and calm because they will be much more cooperative if you're nice to them). If they won't let you, insist on it, because they have to eventually, remember to be nice,  no matter how aggravated you get. Give the supervisor the number and tell them that this is the number for the cousin and explain that you have no contact with him. Ask that they no longer call you and tell them that the number they are calling is a private phone.<br>  <br>  That's just basically what you should do, if that dosen't work, or if you need a better walk through, you can e-mail me at desolateyetallundaunted@yahoo.com|`|F6yfJSr9aa	Wow, that is quite a story.

You have had absolutely no involvement in the purchase of the vehicle and CHASE is therefore unlawfully pursuing you through the collection agency.  It is important that you contact CHASE about the matter, because the collection agency is merely doing their job (and they are performing it on CHASE's behalf).<br>  <br>  I do not think you will need an attorney.  You need to begin by collecting various difference numbers related to this specific CHASE company.  And begin calling departments, asking for management, asking management to speak to a higher up person.  <br>  <br>  This is a gigantic company and you need to be A WHOLE LOT more aggressive about this than you are being.

The answer is that they can make a statement in their terms of sale saying that only damage up to a certain amount (usually the liability covered by the shipping company) is covered and that if goods arrive damaged then they will issue a refund once compensation is received from the shipper.  They can also say that they will cover higher losses if the buyer pays for shipping insurance.
lMH2cA1kaa	This is a very sensitive political and history question. Geographically, "Taiwan" and "Republic of China" point to the exactly same region. However, world's main stream society doesn't recognize "Republic of China" (a country). Instead, Taiwan is considered as part of China by vast majority of countries including the United States. Only couple dozen of small countries, mainly in South America, recognize Taiwan as a country, namely "Republic of China".<br>  <br>  "Chinese Taibei" is a popular and compromised name for Taiwan when both mainland China and Taiwan need to attend the same international events or organizations (non-political, such as Olympics) as two separate entities.|`|dgWFeTX2aa	In short, all three names refer to the same area. <br>  Taiwan is the name of the island.<br>  Republic of China is the name of the country governing Taiwan, Peng Hu, King Man, Ma Tsu, and some islands in South China Sea.<br>  Chinese Taipei is the name used to represent Republic of China in the international events and organizations since Taiwan/ROC is diplomatically considered a rebelled province of PRC (People's Republic of China).

AA11163314	You realize that much of the decline in stock prices is a direct consequence of the spending bill just passed and the additional spending bill that Obama said he will sign?<br>  <br>  Unlike the Obama supporters people who place their own money on the line when they invest pay close attention to the effects of the spending bill.<br>  <br>  For example - are you even aware of exactly where the money to pay for these spending bills will come from?  Here is a clue for the clueless - it is going to come out of the same pool of money that normally goes into the stock market (the investment and capital market).  The government is borrowing that money in competition with the people seeking to borrow money for business investment and in competition for the money that would otherwise go to purchase stocks.<br>  <br>  Another thing to consider is that with Obama's promise to repeal the Bush era tax reforms - stocks are not going to be a good long term investment in the future.  Thus people who are looking to invest long-term are disinclined to invest in the stock market due to the massive tax increase they will be facing.<br>  <br>  And finally, the promises of tax hikes on the 'rich' have caused them to move their mkoney out of economically productive investments and into investments that are designed more to protect them from the tax increases.  Remember the term 'tax shelter' and how these things are only popular during periods of high taxes on the investing classes (which are also periods of low economic performance).|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	People who invest in the market are mainly ordinary people like us.

McCain has alway been a supporter for funding of alternatives, long before he made his presidential bid.  Two things caused the vaporization of T Boone's plan:  One is that the price of oil started to come back down, and the American people tend to have short attention spans.<br>  <br>  Secondly and more importantly, he couldn't get enough people to come on board with him to garner enough congressional support for the subsidies needed to continue.  I know I'm going to get my head bitten off by all the lefties here, but wind power isn't economically feasible.  If it was, why wouldn't the evil rich get busy on it?  They'd have support of Dems. right???  They'd be making money right???  They'd be providing high paying jobs and stimulating the economy right???  They'd be helping the planet right???  The problem is that the places that really need the power either don't have the wind, or the places to build the windmills, or both.  So even if we build the windfarms where they are feasible, the transmission lines needed to carry that volume of power are beyond comprehension.  Cost alone is prohibitive, not to mention environmental concerns, health concerns etc..  Plus would you want one of these things in your backyard? How would you get the right-of-way to build it? The only thing people hate worse than oil pipelines are power lines?  I'vr worked on both, <br>  I know.  Additionally, (again I'm gonna get pounded for this, but) wind power is inconsistent.  <br>  <br>  Long story short, T. Boone needed two things he couldn't get in order to make this work for him:  A lot of investors, and massive subsidies.  Of course his motives were profit.  The difference between myself and some of your other answerers is that I wasn't mad at him for wanting to make money.  I was mad at him for perpetuating a fraud.|`|IgaW4g8Naa	if you really understood the energy problem you would realize how ludicrous this question is.  we will need every single source of energy including drilling and wind and solar and whatever else we can come up with just to keep pace with oil depletion.  read the IEA report on the state of the worlds oil supply and you will understand that the worlds oil supply is depleting at 9% per year while world wide demand will only increase even if its not in a straight line.|`|hXwqKidraa	The election is over.

Once again, looks like he is seeing something that you missed.|`|gSdeVUOTaa	Wherever there is a profit there is Mr. Pickens.|`|3MM64geHaa	Because he knows that drilling is necessary. He knows that socialism is not the answer to our economy. He knows that inexperience in the white house is not wise.  He has never  been against drilling. He is just for exploring alternatives. Remember, he wants wind energy to take over the fueling of our homes so that there is more natural gas can be used in our vehicles.|`|jWcVcXZQaa	McCain and Palin supported his plan to get government money granted to a new company he started.

nDvrN6Qgaa	The same way you get promoted in the Regular Army.  They are both governed by the same Army Regulations.  Time in Grade, Time in Service are the initial requirements.  And of course your squad/team leader and your Plt Sgt have to recommend you for promotion and of course for Sergeant and Staff Sergeant you need the Commander's recommendation as well.  After that it is all promotion board Performance and points earned and of course the cut off scores for each grade and each MOS.  Good luck to you.|`|3xTNOevjaa	Length of service. Being in Reserves does not get you anywhere, you have to be active to reach to the point of SGT, Major, etc..|`|7f1TfskEaa	Armstrong is wrong again.<br>  <br>  Promotions in the Army Reserve are handled very similar to the active duty.  E-4 to E-5 is done locally.  For Command Sergeant Major, that is E-9 and very competitive.  Major is an officer and that is going through the officer promotion system which is an Army Reserve board.<br>  <br>  In the Reserves, you are in a unit and promotions will also depend on vacancies.  You may be promoted from E-6 to E-7 (Staff Sergeant to Sergeant First Class), but if your current unit doesn't have a vacancy for an E-7, you would have to transfer to a unit that had an opening.  That is tough, but active duty would move you, so it kind of equals out.
5rL4njnxaa	I wouldn't say racism isn't an issue but classism might be a bigger one.  The Bush administration has been fighting class warfare against the middle class for 8 years.  Now that we are trying to reverse it they are claiming Democrats are promoting class warfare.<br>  <br>  But it goes way beyond our borders.  Would we have a trade imbalance if other countries paid their workers a living wage and allowed them to organize?  Would terrorist have such an easy time recruiting new bombers if the people they were recruiting from weren't so impoverished?<br>  <br>  I wouldn't blame everything on classism but the extreme chasm between the small number of wealthy and the huge population of poor and getting poorer contributes significantly.  Racism and religious intolerance aggrivate things even more.|`|bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	Not enough.

NZrjvKWjaa	Good Morning!!!!|`|D7QP6vBKaa	NO. I don't think it's not possible, becoz few months ago Modi won there overwhelmingly, despite severe 'rebellion' problem in BJP in Gujrat. ppl's mind can't change so soon, when no major political incident  happened there by this time.<br>  <br>  And it's the Bidhan Sabha election which choose the state govt, not the Lok Sabha, which is going to be held. If BJP accidentally lose in Gujrat in this election, even then BJP govt in Gujrat will not fall - we'll 've to wait for next Bidhan Sabha election for this.|`|099f9932fda7deca1bf90d1e23d79b0eaa	OK I have taken your word, lets wait till the elections are over.|`|WH3MfnW2aa	Gujarat has always shown way to India in the time of crisis. Maturity in political thought process of Guujaraties is highest in the world. You shall not forget that both fathers of nations of India and Pakistan hail from Gujarat only. <br>  <br>  You with your pea nut size brain and skewed thinking are going to be surprised in big way when whole of India would emulate Gujarat.|`|7da14853d5e190bfb46c6b43cc6e1d16aa	If corruption is the only barometer you follow, than I think its the congress who shud lose the election becoz they are bigger crooks, coz they have literally eaten this country's wealth for so many years together, Congress party is led by Gandhi Family which is a family who probably has links with the KGB of Russia ( read Mitrokhin Archives ) and BJP is a less corrupt party coz they have not been given enuff chances to make money by the people. And if policies are kept as barometer than also its the congress which should lose the election coz their policies are as stale as the congress party itself. and they DESERVE to be thrown out of the office coz they have not done anything for the majority of this country, they have been busy appeasing the muslims and the dalits, over all these 5 yrs misrule.<br>  BJP might have 39 casaes filed against them but if yopu look ate the collective record of the parties supporting the Congress at the centre then you will realise who is the party which deserve to be dumped in the dustbin and that obviously Congresss. Will you support Mulayam Singh? Will you support Shibu Soren ? Will you support the Communists ( who supported congress before ? ) it may not affect you but it does affect me and my kidz for their future in this country. coz I belong to the majority community of this country. Just observe the skyline of any city today from a high rise building and the number of Masjid Minars and the number of Mandir Shikhars will tell you the congress govts lies about the population of muslims in this country. You may not realise it today but its going to affect your children in the future when they will say "Allah" and not follow Hinduism as their religion. Moreover soon you will have Taliban in our country as well which in turn will be supported by the illegal migrants of Bangladesh, who never had any respect for their own country which is why they fled their own country and intruded in India, so you cant expect them to be loyal to this country and they will support Taliban and you and me will suffer in the very near future, courtsey the Ploicies of so called Secular Congress. Thats why we need to defeat congress in this general election. if you dont understand it now thats your problem, i have understood it and I will never vote for a party like congress. Even if LK Advani is a crook ( as some one says in the answer to this question ) I would rather support hin and not the inexperienced another son of Gandhi Family. We must underestand that we need to get rid off this Gandhi Family. Hence I will never vote for the Congress.|`|GllB4mPZaa	As [mostly] always u r wrong again.|`|xOVYHbuiaa	how dare u to tell all Gujarati's having black money you are a big scoundrel and ***** and r you a some future teller always in yahoo question telling what will happen to this and that ....<br>  you will see what will happen to BJP in 16th may and what is answer of people to congress and its 5 year misrule.<br>  and people like you will be ashamed for what you have predicted.|`|psVvOm54aa	Well for one you have got yourself worked up.From Chanakya to CPM via Red fort and other destinations!!!

r6dsc5fNaa	On top of that, more than half the pork in the current stimulus package was tacked on by Republican congressmen.|`|c6966d0b78820379a53d653205aa5aabaa	Forget the spending for a minute, in the two months that has been in office Obama has yet to implement one policy that is based on sound business or economic principles, every chance he gets he talks down the market and the economy, and he lives in a way that does not evoke confidence.<br>  <br>  He could have fixed this thing first day in office by improving the business environment, but that is not his focus.  Yes, it is his fault, he owns this mess. <br>  <br>  Don't forget he was in the Senate for years before he was President and instead of passing bills that would help the economy he spent the entire time running for another office.  Yes, it is his fault, he owns this mess.|`|9PlDaDzuaa	Well there is blame to go all around on this. It is I must point out  it was the democratic representatives that pushed to get Fannie and Freddie to start making loans for houses to people that couldn't afford to maintain the payments on those homes. The thought was that everybody should own their own home if they want to.  Well the reality is that not everybody can afford to own their own home. Well then looked what happened - the housing bubble burst which meant those people that were struggling to make mortgage payments who had taken out second and third mortgages to make ends meet now had houses that weren't worth as much as the loans they had taken out against them - which then meant that even if they sold them it wouldn't pay for what was owned against it. So then people started defaulting on loans which then destroyed the banking system. So as you can see the demo crates had a huge role to play in where we are now.<br>  <br>  We all spent money we didn't have, we all need to start to live within our means. That includes the government. Pork was a big part of both parties over the last 8 years - Pork in fact was a big party of every Americana's spending over the last eight plus years.<br>  <br>  So tell me if that is a part of what got us where we are why are we creating a bill that continues that. Isn't it time to live within our means?|`|S1EYd5WVaa	Weather you believe it or not, the economy goes in cycles. There is nothing anyone can do about it. It's Obama's policies that are taking a down turn and making it a whole lot worst.

Blame his (Obama) economic policies for making it worst|`|Un3YxFvRaa	Regardless of what you say, the facts are that under President Bush, I had a job, a home and a small savings account... Plus, I felt safe in this country.  <br>  <br>  Now, none of the above are true.... the proof is in the pudding... even for those in massive denial:  If you want to know where our economy is going under Obama economics, just look at the Stock Market. Ever since Obama won the election in November, the Stock Market has been falling steadily.   The stock market players know how the wind is blowing... and America is no longer a place in which they want to invest....

We started falling when Dummycrats started controlling congress. What a dumb a@@|`|AA11313983	Pardon?  Bush did plenty.  The problem was that he did the same stuff that Obama is doing now. I'm interested to see your research on how Bush's stimulus had more pork and twice the cost.  And no, you can't hide behind Obama's definition of an earmark.<br>  <br>  The Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 had a total projected cost of $158 billion.  Obama's stimulus bill has a total projected cost of $787 billion.  Last I checked, $787 billion far exceeds half of $158.|`|YaTgrhr9aa	Blaming Bush will not get Obama off the hook, by the way, the economy was not doing bad until the Dems took control for the past three years. <br>  <br>  Obama has NO focus and NO plan, he is hoping something sticks to the wall so to speak <br>  <br>  Obama has PUT us into DEBT for the next century, TRILLIONS of dollars spent on PORK|`|be5d02d1dc7db03c5839affa5d0d722faa	They do not want you to understand...why bother trying<br>  <br>  They blame anyone and everyone...it is inbred into their minds as children<br>  <br>  While we know both sides have hand in it, they will point out it is only Obama now..using this to incite and spread their rage at losing the election...<br>  <br>  Watch as it comes closer to thier lives...while this has been going on for almost two years, the negative begin to feel it and reason why all the sudden interest in every single penny, what the reps are doing and the blame game is on<br>  <br>  It is all for one and none for all with these people|`|fbb4ab0738eb7d2ea8be8024fec8d32aaa	Very instrumental in the creation of this "hole" was a Democrat majority Congress, least you forget.<br>  And the word is "Nada"; not "notta".<br>  <br>  Edit:  Incorrect, Varissa:  I'm a Democrat....have been longer than you have been alive.|`|Wn4NVHeeaa	this is so true, mostly the only reason people are against Obama is because he's not white, yeah its true not all people hate him because of that but its true. and because of some stupid people out there. :]

There are a lot of people sitting on death row claiming to be innocent. Most probably aren't but I wouldn't want to be the one to pull the switch on the person who truly is. There have been cases of people who were executed and then exonerated. I just don't have that much faith in the judicial system. Those who receive the death penalty are frequently those who can't afford an attorney and get a court-appointed lawyer, not necessarily someone who has their best interest at heart.

You can file a civil action if you want, and waste your own money instead of the taxpayers.|`|F0uLexezaa	you should have gone there with a police officer to get your stuff (and at least have a police record made that you wanted to retrieve your stuff and he refused). unless you can document the times you've made a request for your stuff (and been denied), i'm afraid that you may not be able to legally recover them. he has the right to dispose of them after a period of time|`|siwxWxa0aa	You can however, sometimes it is better to just walk away. You say this "stuff" was left behind over a year ago. You've gotten along all this time with out it. A court case would simply keep you tied to this person, is that really the healthiest thing to do? The right move would have been to have the police escort you to retrieve your belongings when this has occurred.|`|637425337df7c9e767eafff511b43419aa	You should have taken care of this a year ago when you broke up. Its not likely you will get anything out of taking him to court. Just being realistic!|`|U69AYTZIaa	Take him to court and bring a copy of the email they sent to court. You definitely can sue for this.|`|vn2Lq7hIaa	Ashley, your situation is common in failed relationships, especially the<br>  bitter ones.Since it's been over a year, the rebuttal period may have expired in which case you can't file charges, but can still take him to small claims court. Your claim has to be 10,000 dollars or less. <br>  <br>   After being evicted, you do not mention giving him a detailed list of your items, and stating you want to retrieve from the property. This is very important to your claim. It informs him that the possessions have value and you want them.<br>  <br>  Have a lawyer send him a registered letter, documenting your missing<br>  items and their value. The letter should inform him to have these items <br>  in easy access to be picked up on a certain date. In lieu of items that can't be located the monetary value is acceptable, with certified funds. ( cash, certified cheque, or money order.)   <br>  <br>  Unless your items have a high dollar value, or you're intent on moral<br>  value, the letter should be the first and last legal attempt to get things back. Your legal costs, the court costs, and the possibility he will counter sue for his legal expenses are not in your favor. It could turn out to be a messy and expensive experience for you.<br>  <br>  Like a game of poker, you've got to know when to hold your cards, and when to through them in. In this situation, your cards are not good enough to keep.<br>  <br>  Good Luck - God Bless|`|X8CaMCe6aa	Without knowing the rules in the State that you reside, I'll go out on a limb and make an educated guess.  There should be some type of small claims court that can easily take care of this in your particular State.  File your claim for a nominal fee, and, while awaiting your court date gather as much information as you can to show that you owned the property in question and that it was in your "ex's" possession.  The e-mail you got from the "gf" is a good start.  If you file the small claim, make sure you include the cost of the small claims fees and your inconvenience costs (copies, time off work, etc.) when you file your claim.  Don't get greedy.  There are limits to how much you can claim in a small claims court; typically between $2500 to $5000.|`|uoHoOkGmaa	I agree it would be very costly. I don't think you should take him to court unless you had something with sentimental value or something very expensive. Otherwise it won't be worthed. Just spend the money you will spent on court fees buying new stuff.|`|x2mgUMb6aa	you must weigh it up,is your left behind stuff worth all the hassle?<br>  you should go round and vandalise the property.<br>  then send all sorts of things to his address(taxi,pizza,curry etc) enjoy.|`|TGbcd9VQaa	Take the M***** F****r to court
nDvrN6Qgaa	You would get a better answer if you directed this question to a member, past or present, of the SAS.  Personally in my experience soldiers are only as gentlemanly as the situation and conditions allow.  War is a dirty business.  Good luck to you.|`|3xTNOevjaa	Not anymore. With all these new technologies, they don't need guerilla tactics to win.
OQmSh8Uaaa	your orders should say something like V16 or V26 or V36, 2d Marine Division, Camp Lejuene, NC.  I can't remember exactly how it was put on my orders for 1/8 or anyother Bn I was in while I was stationed in Lejeune.  the first number is the Bn and the second is the regiment.|`|3xTNOevjaa	Depends on their needs.|`|C7wjR42Daa	You are able to deploy now.<br>  <br>  And no one knows when your unit deploys. You dont even mention what unit you are going to. <br>  <br>  6th Marines has three battalions under it. So you still will be placed into a battalion and then you will see when you deploy and to where.<br>  <br>  Currently 2/6 is deployed in Iraq. I am guessing you will not go to 2/6.|`|VQ4VYjBVaa	I don't get why you are asking here.. lol<br>  <br>  If you are an actually Marine (which you need to learn to capitalize..)<br>  you will know when you are at your duty station..
bmsq005uaa	That is a pretty complicated question.  When I joined the US Navy, I was taught a list of 7 missions, first to protect lives imperiled on the sea.  Many times, the US military is deployed to help disaster relief efforts and to save lives of US citizens, as well as foreigners.  It is also sometimes deployed to punish terrorists or those who fund, shelter, and protect them.<br>  In Southeast Asia & in Korea, it was deployed to prevent the spread of communism...google "The Domino Theory".<br>  In Granada, it was deployed to rescue American expatriates.<br>  In WW2, it was deployed to save the entire world, in response to direct attacks against the United States and in response to declarations of war against the US.<br>  In WW1, it was deployed in response to the destruction of US ships, and the loss of US lives resulting from this.  The Lusitania, carrying US citizens, was merely the straw that broke the camel's back.<br>  The US military is tasked with protecting US interests.  That does, certainly, include the power and wealth of US corporations...but it also includes protecting the power and wealth of foreigners who trade with, sell to, and buy from those corporations.<br>  Sometimes, the US military is deployed under the orders of one man who acts from bigotry and stupidity (the second invasion of Iraq), simple stupidity (the bombing of Somalia), or well intentioned but misguided ideals (Vietnam).<br>  However it is deployed, however, it is composed of mostly well intentioned, decent, people who usually want to do what is right.  A few are different, but you get that anywhere (most commonly, in governmental positions and high corporate offices).|`|aSTmFCiBaa	ketillo the medic,10 pts|`|9rhmeb7raa	To support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. That's the oath they take in the armed forces and that's the job they perform.|`|8OiAAF5taa	What kind of question is this?<br>  <br>  Almost all countries of the world have a standing military to protect their sovereignty and their national interests.|`|VQ4VYjBVaa	uhhh you need to protect both....<br>  <br>  If you have no wealth or companies how are people gonna work and provide food? <br>  <br>  <br>  I swear a lot of people take their freedom for granted...|`|dcZcPtIoaa	WE are the World's Police Force!

339593f4c4dfbe655416ef8e568866fbaa	I am not anti-choice, I am anti-Abortion.  I think every woman should have a choice.  First, she can choose to have sex or not.  Second, she can choose to use the birth control of her choice or not.<br>  <br>  If she chooses to have sex and not use birth control - I can't support her choice to murder her child,  because I believe that child, if given a CHOICE, would choose life.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Who thinks this? No one I know.  The fact that it is difficult to get pregnant if both people are trying to avoid it is one of the biggest reasons abortion should be illegal.|`|9HdexsSCaa	Well, if she chooses not to have the sex, the odds are she will not have an unwanted pregnancy.|`|LNatMloraa	I am all for letting a woman choose<br>  <br>  as long as my tax dollars do not pay for her health care|`|skfwBBHkaa	that isnt what he said.|`|yAsLhdp2aa	pregancy is a consequence of having sex. sex=baby. therefore it is important to take responsibility for ones own choice to have sex, if pregancy is a result.<br>  <br>  the choice should be wether or not to have sex..not wether or not to abort.|`|Ljq25VEJaa	Ummmm, what?

I don't see the relevance on what one has to do with the other.<br>  <br>  Lets go ahead and bomb Iran, North Korea, Syria, etc... and say it's fine to ignore these acts because we have some problems at home.
