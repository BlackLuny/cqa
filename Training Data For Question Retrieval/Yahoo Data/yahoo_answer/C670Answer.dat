AA12349214	Tim J is right you know.<br>  You cant possibly marry this man with all these issues going on.<br>  You need to talk to another family member and explain all this and hopefully they can mediate between you and your partner.  This is an immature and selfish way to behave - but he may just not be ready for the commitment that you are looking for.  But marriage isnt the answer - you know what the song says - you cant play on broken strings.<br>  Mend it all first then get married.  Or there will be tears before bedtime.|`|AA11646252	Go do some things with him.  I know you have a little one but get him to do things with you and you him.  If you can go do some fun stuff together then this being together will not make him feel as if he is tied down.<br>  <br>  rd|`|yw7AeZn2aa	Sounds like he is not at all ready to get married.   He is too immature and is not ready for the responsibility of having a wife and baby. <br>  <br>  The best thing you can do for yourself is to focus on yourself. Get a job, go back to school etc. Find a way to support yourself if he left tomorrow.  Then the decision on whether to stay together will be based on what you both want and not on what you need (his job $$).  Seriously, I think i fyou push him to get married now you will regret it big time.  And get on the pill or something! Don't get pregnant again!|`|briRpzL1aa	It sounds like your fiance is quite immature and is not ready yet to grow up and be a father.  I would recommend giving it some time before you marry him.

Perhaps she just doesn't want to do these things, but doesn't want to hurt your feelings. A lot of elderly people find it easier to just sit at home in their later years, and don't really want to go out much. It's not uncommon. She's not turning her back on you, she just doesn't have the same enthusiasm,or spark as you. Go easy on her, you'll be there someday too.|`|wBXt9nkeaa	tell her to have fun in life and don't care about what he says. you live only once and if you are in good health, then spend your life doing things you like. if it took you a long time to stay healthy enough to go do things in the world, don't waste that time at home.

I don't think it should be a requirement, though...if you're interested in dating somebody then date him.  <br>  <br>  I'm a bit curious why you would even ask this question, really, most people seem to be pretty sure of whether or not they want to date somebody.

We could actually do more then hang out and  have our parents drive us ever-where.  In groups we did the mall, we walked around the main strip of town,  there was a good burger place with malts and cheep baskets of fries.  We would hang out by the beach.

He shouldn't be saying such things to arouse your feelings when you're just a friend.  He's got no respect for you or his girlfriend.  A male friend shouldn't be saying things with a sexual overtone to a female friend.  That changes the quality of a friendship.  I think you should avoid this man's company unless you're with a crowd.

Perhaps it's how you express this side of yourself that's unattractive, not the fact that you take care of yourself.|`|BqqDJXkjaa	Women definatly do not want what you think they want, but it's all about the image you project to people. <br>  If when offered pizza you say "Oh no, I just couldn't!" then people are going to assume it's because you're worried about the size of your ***. <br>  If you say "Nah, no heart desease for me today thanks!" then you might have a better chance with the ladies.  <br>  <br>  Trust me - women don't want fat, unhealthy men. At most, women want someone who's relaxed and carefree.|`|cMAlbDaSaa	cuz that is gay!<br>  <br>  look i work out and i eat alot of salads! and good food! but when im out with a girl and there's a pizza <br>  <br>  i don't say no, your a man a couple of slices wont hurt and you can work that off at the gym the next day<br>  <br>  stop being a fing dinousor!|`|vHjYw1txaa	Women do like a fit guy that has it together.

If a person is not health-conscious it's a personal decision.  so, if i met you and we were attracted to each other, your diet wouldn't come into play.  <br>  <br>  i would not think you were gay, either.<br>  <br>  however, if you were insulting, talked about yourself 100 miles per hour, and had terrible habits and social skills, i'd have to bow out.|`|K6JSNQJQaa	Well Mr. Politically Correct....you must be talking to all the wrong women.  I don't know of any that particularly look for that quality (slobs/out of shape) in a man. I think sometimes men (and women for that matter) can get into that shape after they get married.  Others that some people might call "out of shape" can't help the way they look regardless of proper diet and exercise.  Believe it or not your genes do have something to do with your body type.  Plus, what you look like shouldn't be examined by someone that doesn't know the entire story of another person and their personal habits such as diet and exercise.<br>  <br>  If you're looking for women who think like you do then you should look at the gym or places like that.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	sounds like you're fishing in the wrong pond.|`|aEpPt9koaa	Um I don't want a sloppy hamburger pizza eating tool man. My fiancee works out 5 times a week, dresses real nice, and has his stuff together. None of my friends date slobs either. So... What are you talking about?|`|ByUS0k8waa	Sorry but they probably aren't turned off by the way you look but by the fact your in love with yourself like most men who are fit and dress nice. They may also find that fact you don't ever splurge and eat a pizza or whatever the girl likes a little odd. Your going to have to open up to women about the reason you don't eat those things and the reason you try so hard to be healthy.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Maybe it's the "excuse me."  Do you put your hand on your hip when you say that?  lol<br>  <br>  Oh, I don't know why you even care what other people think about this.  I ONLY date well dressed, clean, slim men.  And so far, none of them have been gay (as far as I know).<br>  <br>  Your typing needs work.|`|UQWusO1waa	YOU SOUND  like weenie boy, thats prob what the ladies pick up on. not many women want a weenie boy, Exception, go find some lib girls.|`|EzZk2pyNaa	Because usually gay men are like that.

Im sure you will have at least one layover and they wont want you wandering around alone. So your best bet is to make sure the airlines has someone watching out for you. You can call the airlines and ask about that.|`|6938f354823450032243cd5ddb6f0ef0aa	You need to just ask. Like everyone else said, there are a lot of factors involved, including money and safety.

I'm dizzy!|`|4Q4dZJHpaa	Don't tell her man,that would make it worse!there's nothing wrong with fancying other people,its perfectly normal.it doesn't mean you have to do anything about it.Ive been with girls n never once cheated but I still fancied other women,n it would be naive to think it wouldn't be the same for her.you always have a choice.do what makes you happy,if your sure your girl is still the person that makes you happy then give it time,if not then finish it n leave the other one for a while until yous are both over each other.but if you just fancy the other girl then don't tell your girlfriend cos its natural to fancy other girls
s6itMDRTaa	sounds like he likes you <br>  just meet him in after class or at lunch and just start a conversation about music or movies or something you like <br>  if he still can't talk to you just give him time <br>  cause it sounds like he's really shy and he really wants to impress you and not look stupid round you|`|glO9I89faa	i think he is interested- just shy maybe he has the same problem as you.

You seem like a good friend to him to be worried for his safety.  What you can do is just be there for him and let him know that if he ever feels like that again to come to you and talk to you about why he feels so depressed.<br>  <br>  Then you can try to talk him about what's going on in his life and letting his parents know that he's thinking about doing it again if he ever does.  Letting his parents know would give them the knowledge they need to try and get help for him.  And since he's already tried, doing it, I'm sure he's going to some form of counseling.<br>  <br>  Just be there for your friend and tell him that you care and that suicide isn't the answer.  Try not to blame yourself for him trying to kill himself because its not your fault.  But the thing to do is let him know that you are there for him and can understand what he's going through.

It's his issue.  He may want to get with you.  I would stay away from the creep.|`|ByUS0k8waa	Sounds like he is probably unhappily married or wants you to be into him.

I doubt he cares if you are attracted. He just wants to lash out and let people know that she isn't fulfilling her end of the bargain. Men know that most women are prudes, so I doubt he thinks you will be attracted to him.|`|vHjYw1txaa	I think he wants you to know he is married but he calls her a roommate to throw you off a bit so you will think they are married yet not really together.

It no longer feels right to call her wife, because they really don't like each other anymore. so he says roommate to try to keep a little dignity. just a guess. many married couples are nothing more than roommates. diff. rooms. diff beds, dont eat together, etc. Ive seen it before, its sad.  She prob. gross too. so they just live as roommates.  Think about it., maybe it feels like odd to him to call her his wife. I could never lay down with a fat women, and never would want to call her wife.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	You're possibly missing out on a point. <br>  <br>  Using the term 'roommates' rather than saying his 'wife' makes things easier for some guys to become and remain respectful of their partner. They are more inclined to think in terms of cleaning up after themselves for example (rather than being nagged to do so), and it removes the stress from the 'stereotyped' roles that often stifle people in some marriages.<br>  <br>  And maybe not, as there are guys who say that so they can get in your pants.

If she makes a man feel good about himself without being too needy and selfish but still letting her personality through, then she should have no problems if she is picking the right sort of men to talk with. <br>  <br>  That's the other half of it...having good judgement to pick a 'good' man and not just a self-important jerk or pretty boy who is only interested in hanging with his mates, picking up tarts and drinking heavily.|`|AA12065443	She sounds like a wonderful independent woman.

Just get out with the girls and try not to think about him! Make sure you keep busy.

It will be better one day soon.|`|1OkyddmPaa	hey wat do you know, my soulmate broke up with me too!<br>  you will get him back<br>  if he rlly is your soulmate<br>  <br>  try to talk to him<br>  but make NO indication that you want to get back together with him<br>  act friendly and happy<br>  <br>  he will miss you<br>  thats my plan to get my man <br>  oh damn i can rhyme|`|hnFFodXgaa	Its natural to feel that way, either you can do one of 3 things, try and get back together with him, try to move on, or continue this spiral into depression while he moves on.|`|xPfh6bW5aa	Like the first answerer said, you have to either try and get back together, move on, or stay unhappy.|`|0uD5weHLaa	go easy on yourself. life is painful, and just because you feel such pain now does nott by any means mean that life will not improve. and soon. peace|`|wnjvvRiqaa	accept the fact that u r no longer together.. everything else will fall in place<br>  all the best<br>  move on..
71VRvldJaa	He sounds like a player to me....he's flirting and testing the water with several girls and biding his time until he suckers one of you in.  Honestly, no, I don't think he likes you and I think if you do hook up with him you will be used and you will end up with a broken heart!  Wouldn't you rather be someone's only one rather than one of many? Set your standards and expectations higher!  He is not showing you any respect by telling you sexual jokes and acting like he wants "to screw you".  You've got to know you're worth more and deserve better than that!|`|XasLRQnXaa	hmm i think he likes you and is trying to see what your reaction would be if he flirted with other girls. You should ask him.|`|6f8eb1df236b453d41b94b11467cd780aa	I think he is both. I think he does like you but, thinks about getting in your pants. First, if he says sexual jokes around or about you he is think about getting in your pants. And other than sexual jokes, he talks to you alot or stares in eyes other than your body he likes you. <br>  <br>  It depends and if not he is just a flirt looking at his options.|`|v8Xr0Mn9aa	don't read so much into it. he's probably just horsing around. perhaps you have more of a thing for him and you're creating a wishful thought in your head.  look at it this way if he likes you, he'll ask you out and you have to make sure it's not because he wants to score. remember teenage boys harmone's are raging.it's cool to have fun and joke around but watch how you play with guys. one minute they're playing with you and the next they're disrespecting you.i've been where you are- so trust me i'm not just talking.
yHJpLxtyaa	Troll. Thanks for the 2 points|`|9754d9a5a67c1d819818bf1f9aa1707baa	No, that will make it worse.

Even if you are fooling around because you like the rush... You have no respect for her and cheating is your way of secretly admitting it to yourself.<br>  <br>  Let her go find someone who won't cheat and won't have to ask if they should pay more attention to her...|`|1k7LIZVWaa	No, you should tell her you don't want to be with her anymore and not cheat on her.  What a loser.|`|817fb3b41964d1a4b3bab64330936db8aa	why dont you just move on?

j7rakyLmaa	You seem ot be showing a great level of maturity in this, which is a nice change. <br>  <br>  As for waiting to get married after university, I've seen it work both ways. For you, I think waiting will be a great asset because it will give you both a chance to know each other more (always a good thing to do, even after you get married) and to learn about yourself and experience the world more. University is as different from high school as highschool was from your home school experience, so take the time to navagate that and grow up with that boy, and then go happily be married. <br>  <br>  If worse comes to worse, engagements can be broken after all. My roommate broke up with her boyfriend of 5 years during uni (not to date any one else, ut just due to changes and stresses and confusions), and then after a few weeks got back together with him convinced that she never wanted anyone else.|`|gWlmU1KJaa	Look forward to being a grandmother at 35 or so, thats the way you seem to be headed.....|`|AA10050051	This is my opinion. I am really glad that you have found someone you have fallen in love with and that you are both willing to become teachers and teach a whole new generation out there. We need more teachers. Anyway, I think you should get married after you two graduate from college and get your degrees. Not before. Once you two accomplish that, you have no where to go but up. Then, you could get married and start a life together. I wish you and your future husband happiness and success.|`|gDf6afBYaa	well being engaged at a young age isn't really out of the ordinary marriage at 23 could be kind of stressed......honestly if you feel you should then do it but my recommendation(which you can tell me to shove it) is to wait until you both get your respective college degrees then have the wedding.....just my opinion.....|`|hhLBjBuvaa	It seems to me the two of you have already made a commitment to being with the other, and show great self-discipline.

Good luck!|`|niq3ETl0aa	I really don't get why you want to get engaged then. But, it's your life. To me it's just a way of owning each other when you have no intention of having sex or getting married for six years. I'm a Christian too, leading a moral life. I don't believe you can stay celebate for six years with the same guy.|`|njHgfl99aa	I think you should wait before you guys get engaged etc.   Make sure that your relationship is stable and the real deal before you move onto the next step. Obviously you have to watch out to see if there is a chance for him to cheat on you etc - you just never know these days considering that it is quite common nowadays to cheat on a relationship around that age anyway.<br>  <br>  But I guess if you think you guys will be together for a long long time without any problems then by all means go for the engagement.  But remember you might not want to plan your wedding etc just yet after the engagement - you'd have to find the right time to do it and that's after University and when both of you can support each other and maybe start a family.<br>  <br>  BTW I'm not married myself so.. yeah.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|vQ0F5g5Kaa	I think that this is a good idea because if your love changes for each other and you realize there are a lot of other people out there worth dating you don't have to get divorced and go through messy legal stuff.....You seem to have a good head on your shoulders just don't be afraid to break off the engagement if your love changes....Best of Luck!|`|IRbw06qAaa	Well, it doesn't look to likely but it seems it is statistics versus love. And I vote for love, always.I Know it is the Greatest Plan In The Universe because I proposed to the girl of my dreams and she said yes, but I am going to college to double major in electrical and mechanical engineering and she is in the army (she's 17 and I'm 18). When I was a freshman I knew I was gonna be with her in the back of my mind and she told me when she was a freshman she knew that I was going to fall in love with her,kinda weird? Until senior year we sort of lived in to separate worlds until one day in JROTC she said "we could have had a great relationship" and I'm like you are thinking what I'm thinking. So we hit it off and were never too far away from each other, but she noticed she wasn't always able to answer my phone calls and able to spend time with me and I think it saddened her. But we know we love each other sooo Bad and Hard and Strong we want to equal and surpass what the other gives.We both know that we want to be able to devote all of our time to each other in our marriage but both of our careers are going to demand so much attention if we were to get married now like you guys every plan we promised to each other would not come to fruition. I told her the knees on my pants will be gone when she returns from I don't know where and she promised me she will marry me when she gets back. I am crushed though because I know when she is leaving but I don't exactly know when she will return. But I told her the thought of our marriage is going to make me work my but off and I shall. Right now I am thinking about the day we'll separate and how sad we are going to be......which really sucks because I have been crying a lot just thinking about not being able to see her for a long time and I just can't fathom the idea myself, it is like that day will be the end of the world and a new me will be unleashed on the world.|`|atu4GFj2aa	I am only 20 years old and I am going to get married at the end of this month, but I have been with my fiance for 2 years and I am about to finish my Bachelor's in political science this May, so I think I can relate.  The difference is my fiance is 28 and a grown man so he can really take care of me.  Like you guys we do not believe in living together until we are married or having sex so we moved up our wedding so we could be together sooner.  I think that you should wait until after the first year of college because just getting engage gets you distracted.  I am planning on law school in the fall but this has been difficult because there are so many "wedding" or "engagement" things to do, even though you would have a LONG engagement... honestly just wait one more year- since you guys are committed to one another... one more year until engagement will fly by. I don't usually go for the promise ring thing, but in your case, I think a promise ring would be very fitting. Good luck and stick to your guns as far as protecting your purity this will take you far in a Christian marriage.  :)|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	I got married at 17, and we are happily married and looking forward to celebrating our 2nd anniversary in September.  I had finished high school and wasn't planning on going to college.  My husband had a steady job and we were both in a good place financially.  I would have to say though, that a 6 year engagement seems like a long time to me.  I was engaged for 7 months and that seemed way too long!  You could definitely do it though!  You sound like you really love him and are ready to be together.  Just keep in touch by phone, email, etc and try to see eachother pretty often.  I hope it works out!<br>  EDIT: I also wanted to say that I'm really glad you aren't planning on living together through all this.  It would never have been an option for me either, and don't let all these other people get to you.  They just don't understand that lifestyle.  You can definitely get through the next six years without having sexual relations, and you'll be so glad you did!|`|AA10975867	Get a promise ring at graduation,that's what they are for - for teenagers in love, teenagers too young to make a lifetime commitment. Be sure that your parents understand that it is also a purity ring,too, or you'll be pregnant before your college ends. I remember being 17 and engaged. and I know how definite I was about him, having babies, etc. I was divorced at 24 and it hurt so unbelievably bad!! You are in love. I believe you. But I also know that people grow apart sometimes when they are going to university. If you are still in love and together after two years of university, then, sure, get engaged and set the date for after graduation. But right now you are in no position - financially, emotionally or otherwise - to announce an official engagement.|`|CUMdhfKzaa	All I can say is that you are chock full of issues.

Most teens don't even stick with the same person to the end of the school year, much less years on end after graduation. That's just how life goes.|`|RuKK1LYiaa	Sounds like your the first person your age to have your head on straight. its ok to be engaged at 17 and get married at 23 i think that gives you a nice long engagement and time to grow as a couple. Congratulations on everything and good job for both of you wanting to wait till college is over, you will both be able to have a stable marriage and great jobs for your future together.|`|bYtCfdwbaa	You have a whole life ahead of you both what's the hurry?If you are meant to be together, when you acheive your goal of teaching then you can make the commitment.True love stands the test of time.<br>  I was engaged at 19,married at 22.Still happy 30 years on.<br>  There's no rush.Enjoy being in love without the pressure of commitment for the time being.
1k7LIZVWaa	He's in love with himself.  You will never be #1 to him.  Can you handle that?  He sounds like a jerk.|`|ByUS0k8waa	He is way to in love with himself and sounds a little on the abusive side with the things he says to you. That is crazy. I could never be with someone who is like that. He is to in love with himself to love anyone else.|`|09658fd4d02a5d3573ab00d1116b0c86aa	sounds like he is in love with himself, make him sleep alone for a long time|`|y5WPZ8dJaa	He seems to have a narcissistic complex. Talk to him about it and let him know that this upsets you! You shouldn't have to deal with his attitude. Tell him something along the lines of "Okay, baby, I know you like to work out, and yes you have a wonderful, fit body, but can you please stop focusing so much on it and putting me second place to your muscles & working out? I feel a bit neglected.."|`|t81MEJ82aa	This isn't *********. He's just a plain old fashioned @sshole. He's completely self-absorbed; not hitting you and not cursing you out should not be selling points. Of course not all, or even most guys are like this, but you put up with it.|`|f7PlvV4Baa	what a tool|`|n8lXItGraa	Ummm..yeah...real cocky.  He seems full of himself for sure.  Maybe you should join a different gym...get really fit...be gone for hours ...get a bot cocky also...and see what his response is.    The next time you argue and he tells you to listen to his chest...tell him sure, the next time he has sex maybe you'll do that.  Make it known that the sarcasm is not appreciated and waiting for sex isn't either!  He needs to grow up a bit for sure.  Hope this helps...|`|eus7WqzUaa	Hell no!  I have had a lot of boyfriends and one long term one dedicated to fitness. That is beyond cocky.  He has a low self esteem.  Just like women that don't think they have anything to offer get breast implants.<br>  <br>  There is a fine line between over-confidence and under-confidence.<br>  <br>  It will just get worse.  He will possibly sleep with other women to help his self esteem because you get sick of appraising him of his physical attributes.|`|q3KCDrMAaa	Do you like being treated this way? I have to tell you, I have no Idea why you are asking this question... you KNOW it's obnoxious behavior. You want us to confirm it. I think the question you should ask yourself is, "Why am I putting up with this? Am I maybe a little superficial like he is and afraid I won't get anyone I think is as hot??"|`|817fb3b41964d1a4b3bab64330936db8aa	sounds like he's in love with himself...narcissism|`|PWDJLTyEaa	NO! Not all guys are like this! Your b/f is an arrogant asshole if you ask me.|`|zxVLEccsaa	he's an asshole, not all guys are like this|`|bacgwHhOaa	He just sounds like a jerk....|`|9a3fC9mOaa	That's annoying, cocky|`|vHjYw1txaa	NO, most guys his age don't act like that.  I don't think he's as cocky as he is in love with himself.  I think he's acting like a kid in High school.  This is not the typical adult behavior for a 24 year old guy.|`|W16vRFTNaa	He is very cocky and he probably thinks he is way too good looking for any girl. But if it doe not bother you then stay with him. and no not all guys are this, because not all of them have bodies like your boyfriend|`|fXGfN5lsaa	run. <br>  run fast and far.|`|77b89da50334d58ffae963702c00caaaaa	All men are not like this.  He isn't cocky.  He's just to full of himself to see anyone else.|`|df2252216471c80586040ea411c1d84daa	get everything ready and save money and leave that asshole!|`|hg8ExtsNaa	you got a future problem with this guy..mr.  ego will get worse trust me.|`|8623f79be89d09f5558c35e0cd1faabcaa	hehehe, I have been with a couple of guys like that in my 20s, ,,,,, well, I think guys are normally obsessed with something , just the way we women are obsessed with relationship, they always have a hobby, and this is his hobby.<br>  <br>  It's kind of a narcissism I would say, I think when he grows up, he will definitely get over it, he surely is proud of his body. But I had a friend who married a guy like that, and he turned out violent and womanizer, so you never know that kind of self-absorption develops to what? ....<br>  <br>  No body is perfect though, if he makes you feel loved and valued continue with him, if you want to change him or you feel left out, break up with him|`|GHH1i6d3aa	Cocky is another word for insecure.  And yes, he's definitely insecure.  He thinks that being attractive will bring him happiness, and help him get out of having to argue with you.  That's like you flashing your breasts at him in the middle of an argument, it's just a distraction from the real issue.<br>  <br>  I think he's very immature for 24, telling you to "gag yourself for an hour" is rude and would make me want to smack him.  He's not ready for a serious commitment at all.
JhvqUvlsaa	I think you should just focus on making friends your age maybe a little older; finding a big "sister" isn't necessarily the answer; and someone who is a couple grades above you may not feel comfortable hanging out with someone your age.<br>  <br>  I wanted a big sister too; I was basically an only child cuz my brother was grown when I was born.  I just made friends my own age at school and in my community (girls) and we were like family.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|nKMJ9U3Paa	Hey sorry I couldn't add any more details to that question lol So I couldn't reply.

Although, we do part-take in a little innocent flirting every now and then. LOL

It probably won't be as helpful because there are not as many people your age on those social network, but they are becoming more popular among middle aged people, so it could worth a shot, at least it is one more avenue they might pop up in.  And even if you don't find them specifically, you might find someone on there that knows how to get in contact with them.|`|NtSQcyHLaa	You can do a Myspace/Facebook search to try to find them. Or there's www.classmates.com , which might help. Other than that, you could just google them, or try a phone book. And if all else fails, hire a private investigator to track them down and stalk them for a while.|`|8rfodw6Qaa	look them up online to see if they are in a phone book anywhere and just call people!<br>  or get in touch with some classmates that you can get a hold of and ask them to help you (by getting numbers from other classmates that they have numbers to)|`|58ScqWG3aa	why don't you use that one advertisement thing where they help you look up your old classmates.i forgot the name but you can google it
67qWgasgaa	Stay in touch with your friend, try to keep in contact. I guess the drifting happens, but just find some new friends to go along with your distant best friend. Hey, I'm gonna be in the same ball park next year, going into high school away from mostly everyone I've been with since 2nd grade. I hate human nature sometimes.|`|2I5XqMDzaa	you could wright it all down and then never think of it again or u could get new and better friends!!|`|58ScqWG3aa	Wow...you could be my twin(not to sound weird),but I'm in the exact same situation.Me and her were all cool and tight in middle school but when we entered high school I had absolutely no classes with and and then she stopped talking to me,so I just had to let her go.I tried to apologize and make up with her but she just didn't care so I left her alone.I really hope you can fix things up with her though.First thing to do is try and talk it out.(that's very important) good luck|`|yWvkXrtsaa	I think it's best to just move on with life and get new friends. I'm not saying that you should ignore her and not talk to her, but this is a part of going to new schools and growing up. <br>  <br>  I don't really talk person-to-person with my old school friends, but I still IM them. That way, they don't "drift away" too far. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|y499zJUzaa	hang out with her on weekends. start calling her after school and let her know how your day went. and tell her things that are important,you guys might become closer. if not, then its time to move on.since you guys go to differnt schoools. meet new people. thats what lifes all about, people coming in and out of your life. sorry if that sounded harsh but its the truth.|`|FYf50Xd0aa	talk to them about it, or find a new best friend.|`|ZLWAe4gBaa	Friendships are difficult, especially as people get older.  Sometimes people just need time.  Going to different schools definitely has a huge impact on how much time you spend together.  It doesn't mean that you have to pull apart from each other though.  I suggest that you take the time to talk to this friend of yours.  Maybe, if they understood that you enjoy spending time with them, and that they mean something to you, they will make sure you are a part of their life again.<br>  If you were to lose this friend, you can't be too upset.  Don't listen to those who say 'a true friend stays true until the end,' because every friendship has rocky times.  Also, let him/her have space to make new friends, or hang out with other people.  Plus, you should examine your habits too- are you sending off bad vibes?  Don't hang over him/her, but let him/her know how much you like him/her and miss the times you used to have with each other.<br>  If she doesn't seem to listen, don't worry.  Over time, things will be normal again.  No matter what, don't forget the good times you had with each other.  And, you could always remind him/her of those as well!  I wish you luck.|`|G10mPS50aa	welll if u are best friends, u guys can stay together. but if its not such a big deal, just look for other friends, or a boyfriend. like me, idk y but suddenly one of my friends is just really annoying to me and i dont even want to be friends. but sumtimes its fine with her. idk i must be bipolar or sumtin lol. well since i answered ur question... could u or ANYONE ELSE PLEEEEEEZ ANSWER MINE!?!?!?

Remember that you are the older sister, hang things over her head for once, see how she likes it. If I was you I would seriously punch her lol, but probably not a good idea though. What will help you most is by you being the bigger person here, if you let her know that is hurts you , she'll just keep feeding off your sorrow, Keep it together for your sake, don't attempt anything stupid like trying to hurt yourself, things will get better with time,, just keep your chin up!!!! <br>  Good Luck with your problem|`|AA11263103	bet the crap out her.|`|TcfyaI0Waa	just tough it out, one day your gonna be better than her and you can rub it in her face and it will feel so good

AA11263103	1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  <br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.<br>  <br>  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.<br>  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>  <br>  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.<br>  <br>  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>  <br>  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.<br>  <br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?<br>  <br>  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!<br>  <br>  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.<br>  <br>  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.<br>  <br>  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.<br>  <br>  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then he may like you - but if the topic is something serious, he may just want to know out of curiosity.<br>  <br>  13. He'll flirt with other girls to get your attention- If a guy is really into you he will want to make you jealous. So, he will most likely flirt with other girls in front of you.

0e5aeac0b9db1edd4e79c50eed3109f2aa	If you can excuse him not paying child support I see no reason for you not to be FRIENDLY. Especially since your children will be spending time with their step-mothers and tension between you and them can make for an uncomfortable situation. Is your husband unable to pay child support because he is not financial able? If so, find other ways to get him to assist with the children. (babysitting, paying for school trips, activities, etc.) She may also be willing to lend a hand if you guys have a good relationship.|`|UGOse5Dvaa	Will fighting with him make things better? <br>  Will he pay more than he does now?<br>  <br>  Maybe it is best to forget about getting help from this loser that won't even support his own kids<br>  <br>  Count on yourself. Take care of your kids.<br>  Lord, knows: their Dad ain't gonna do it.|`|djUMvICoaa	No if you let yourself become too close you lose focus about what you should be getting and why.  Old feelings can overrule your thinking and you shouldn't have that.  Being civil is more important.|`|bNheuULUaa	no children come before a friendship|`|g4AAZRuxaa	That is totally up to you.|`|7b27127244ac3ec3fd8e90dd6ba85685aa	yes you have to be friends no matter what . at least for the kids sake|`|817fb3b41964d1a4b3bab64330936db8aa	you can be CIVIL towards them...i dont know about being buddy friends with them..especially with them purposfully not paying child support that they know should be paid.<br>  <br>  takes a lot of nerve to be buddy with you knowing you didnt make those kids alone...what a dog...with a sorry excuse of a wife...|`|1k7LIZVWaa	One has nothing to do with the other.  What does money have to do with anything?  If he's not paying support, he should be.  Some friend.  I guess that's why he's your ex?|`|n8lXItGraa	Still the father of your children right?  Yes it is good to be friends if at all possible. He should be paying child support tho.  Maybe you should talk about that one!  Hope this helps...|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	friendly or civil, yes. friends No.  lack of child support could be an indication that he is not capable of caring.
7mIXWzGTaa	Maybe he realized what you guys do could be considered inappropriate in the workplace and someone could file charges.  Touching in the workplace is never advised. It would be better to set up a meeting away from the work environment.

Maybe he wasn't in a good mood.  Just cause you didn't immediately light up his day and make him cream his pants doesn't mean theres something wrong with him.   Maybe he's down flirting with you.  And a touch on the elbow? Come on, if there is any place you can touch a girl where it means absolutely nothing, it would be the elbow. Relax.

7cdc801bdb4ad5ebfe07957d02070809aa	Marriage is a social, spiritual, or legal union of individuals.<br>  A marriage is often formalized during a marriage ceremony, which may be performed either by a religious officiant, by a secular State authorized officiator, Each state has different laws (judge, county clark, notary public, religious ministers, etc) who can perform wedding. All state require that a person shall obtain from the county clark a marriage license which is a document needed for authorized officiant to marry parties. So there is a state involvement, who can marry who,  and once you are permitted to marry you choose by whom you will be married.|`|t81MEJ82aa	That seems pointless, and playing a simple game of semantics.|`|5jMNBO2naa	what would be the point?<br>  to get married in USA you still need a wedding license ( unless you are a native american, then you do not ), even if you get a civil or religious ceremony..|`|c07v7O80aa	Here they get a license from the state and register the completed marriage with the state. It hardly matters where of how they make the public declaration through a ceremony. Why add another hoop to jump through. The French make rather a point of thinking highly of religion but keeping it firmly in its place. We could do that, but haven't happened to do it that way. Going the civil ceremony route here is no burden. Most judges can do it.|`|817fb3b41964d1a4b3bab64330936db8aa	it is and should remain a personal choice. when the government can determine HOW we marry we are giving it too much control...isnt democracy supposed to be for the people, of the people and by the people?<br>  <br>  that's just my opinion...|`|8ilHQMq5aa	i dont see the point.|`|NB4h4jTyaa	I am a fan of civil marriages for EVERYONE - gay or straight. Then, if you want to have a religious ceremony, you may.<br>  <br>  In this country, there is supposed to be a separation of Church and State. Having civil marriages required would accomplish this nicely and take one of the hot button religious issues off the election platforms.

Q7ALl9zeaa	She might be worried about him, but is showing it the wrong way. I think your husband should talk to her about it too.It might mean more coming from him. She does know her grandson, as a grandson. You know her grandson as a husband and she needs to realize that you are the future with him, and she is a big part of his life too, however she isn't really letting you "in" to her family. Would it be difficult to visit her now and then, perhaps allow her to see the you that your husband loves. Either she needs to come to grips nicely, or she will have to be out right told..depends on her personality. I am sure you feel like you are stuck in the middle of it here, but i am sure your husband does too, and even his grandma might too. you sound like a very sweet and reasonable person, I do hope you can sort through it. This is not the time for drama when your husband is deployed, you need support. Do you know if his grandpa was in the army, perhaps she has other reasons for feeling this way? I hope it all ends happily, and i wish a very safe return of your man. God bless.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	She's just a concerned mother figure, don't take what she says personally.  Try correcting her in a way that's reassuring.  "I know you feel like he has no one, but he has me, he has his siblings, he's doing okay."  And remind her that he's lucky to have her.  If she feels appreciated by you, she'll learn to appreciate you back.|`|NtSQcyHLaa	Try to talk to her and tell her the way you feel about her and the way her comments affect you. Just convince her that you know what you're doing and you truly love her grandson. She must not believe that for some reason, so it's your job to convince her that you have only his best interest at heart.|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	let it go in one ear and out the other, yet at the same time your husband also needs to let her know that you are his wife and that you are doing your best to support both him and take care of her (granny).|`|0e5aeac0b9db1edd4e79c50eed3109f2aa	Its time to nip this in the bud and respectfully ask his grandmother why she says such hurtful things. (use the word hurtful so she knows how you feel) Until you do, you are going to harbor resentment towards her and its going to make it more difficult to deal with her. There could be tons of reasons why she seems to exhibit this behavior, but the bottom line you are his wife and if he felt as if you were good enough to have that title, she has to respect his decision and you. Good luck.|`|P8uxu93Iaa	dont be mean to her.. and always gain ur husbands trust. he will stand by urside as long as u respect his grandmother.<br>  <br>  i know its crazy , but shes REALLY OLD, just for one time, agree to whatever she says and there she will feel different towards u.<br>  <br>  go stay with her for a night or somethin, make her love u.. try to atleast. ur husband will adore u more for that.. and she will have nothin to annoy u with ;)<br>  <br>  goodluck and pls answer mine<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307154941AAIJB9Z">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|n8lXItGraa	She's a lonely old woman that loves and misses her grandson.  She's convinced that he needs her...as much as she needs him.  Just keep assuring her that you will take good care of him, and maybe she can help you "get to know" him better.  She will resent you less if she can help him in any way.  You're right in a way...she doesn't want to share him.  It's normal for some older folk to feel useful in that capacity.  Just go along with her, and don't take what she say's to heart.  It's not you personally...anyone that takes her grandson away from her would feel the same.  That's how she might see it...you're replacing her.  It's not easy getting old.  When you have kids...and especially grand kids, you'll understand what she's going through.  Be patient, and be kind...she can't help it.  As long as you and your hubby are happy..who's it going to hurt?   Hope this helps...|`|1k7LIZVWaa	All you can do is assure her that you love him very much and know him in a very different way than she does.

So what if she says he needs her?  You know the truth - he's your husband and he loves you.  She can say whatever she wants but it doesn't change the truth, does it?<br>  <br>  Just think of her as needing to believe in her own worth.  She's old and probably alone.|`|AA11624887	To me is sounds like she has a very special place in her heart for her grandson.... Great, good for her.... But you just need to remember that your husband has a special place for you, and for her.  You are right not to want to hurt her back after she makes her comments, that would only make things worse.  Say things to her that make her feel less threatened by you.  Maybe say something like.  "You know, you have always been so supportive to him as he was growing up, as well as now.  He is lucky to have the both of us around"... "He feels the same way about you, that is why he always asks me to come check on your".... "one day we may have kids, but I know we have the rest of our lives to continue getting to know each other".... <br>  <br>  I think that might soften her up a bit.  Good luck....
i6Ix28IPaa	Your husband has clearly been her favorite for many years.  Your husband is wrong about one thing.  HE needs to be the one to tell the woman that you are the love of his life and show her how important you are you him.  <br>  <br>  Grandma needs to hear this--from HIM, not from you.<br>  <br>  There is a place for both of you in his life. If Grandma's love for her grandson is healthy, she will want him to be happy and not monopolize his affection.|`|AA11294738	DJ hit the nail right on the head, I would follow her sage advice.|`|817fb3b41964d1a4b3bab64330936db8aa	i think your husband is right. she's overprotective of him and his brother and in a polite way, if i were you, i would assure her that you all are fine and things are going great with yall. <br>  <br>  it sounds like she has created her world around her grandsons as her source of comfort. she sounds like she needs to feel needed to affirm herself. (insecurity issues on her part). grandma aint going nowhere so you gots to stand up to her. just dont let it soar into an argument. <br>  <br>  Plus your husband needs to reinforce the fact that yalls relationship is solid, safe and secure. until he tells her that (repeatedly) it will be an one sided affirmation, sorely lacking his support.|`|djUMvICoaa	I guess it's time for you to put your foot down and tell your husband that you can't take talking with his grandma anymore, it's too draining on you and that if he has anything he wants her to know he should maybe write her a letter or give her a call, but to leave you out of it.  Don't let yourself become any type of football for any type of verbal abuse, which is what she is doing to you.|`|NB4h4jTyaa	Your husband needs to let her know that she needs to stop talking to you like this. All you can do is be respectful, but if he is not going to stand up for you why is he making you call her?<br>  <br>  When you call to check up on her, do just that. The minute she starts making disparaging comments to you, cut her off and say, "Ok! Glad you're all right! Talk to you soon!" and get off the phone.|`|FewhKlx9aa	It has nothing to do with you,that is her favorite  grandson.The need for you to check on her when there are other siblings to do that shows you they are close.Just listen to her and say yes grandma I know and when you leave put it behind you.She's old and not going to change.You married the favorite the other is'nt married yet,so she might say it then too.|`|c07v7O80aa	Very likely he's her favorite, and she has let this move her to inappropriately say what she feels. She's probably always been a bit like that. Or, she just needs people to feel sorry for her, and she's attached that need to your husband. Don't worry about it. You'd have a worry if he had been acting like she meant more to him than you did, but he's not. The fact that he told you to tell her you're "taking over" makes it sound like she's been doing this to him since before you came along, and he was tired of it then and is still tired of it. But I'll bet HE won't tell her that. Don't you tell her that either. Just tell her you're sure she's right and that he misses her, too. When he gets home, I suspect he could tell you some old family stories that would reveal where this comes from. Or maybe not. Grandchildren NEVER really know those things unless someone tells them, and they aren't things the older family members tell until you're old yourself, and they're about gone. By nice and have sympathy for her. In fact, next time she says she knows him so well, ask her to tell you about him.
gAV1nZymaa	dude, it's simple, how much of the attention do you give her...meaning, do you give her the same amount of attention as these to hers guys you mention and in the same way? or alot less and not in the same manner? <br>  <br>  she could just be playing around with you, testing the waters as they say, to see who's who and how far she get with each of you....however, we here on yahoo don't know the girl like you do so we can only go on what you give us...<br>  <br>  ...b/c to be honest, this exact thing happens to all of us in school...we like someone and we work that person to see how they'll react...do you react everytime she shows you some attention?<br>  <br>  ...and if you hardly acknowledge she's there ans she still shows you alot of attention, more often than she does the others, then perhaps she's just been burned one too many times and hoping you'll drop your balls and get on with it.<br>  <br>  life's too short to be pondering on if's and isn'ts ok, just take the girl aside one day in private and simply ask her...if she's mature enough (b/c you dont want a girl who isn't anyways do ya?)...ask her what's up, say to her you've been wondering and would like to know if she simply just enjoys attention and reaction...or is forreal?|`|Al4Gcgalaa	im 13 so , imiyt lead them all on if they were phitties but not if i didnt like em , personally i would just try and find out which one was nicest and gave me most attention coz girls like attention, so if she is trying to get some attention out of youu dont worry thats just girls for you. <br>  If shes quite nasty then dont bother with her, but if shes reall good looking just go for it , but in a reall casual wayy .<br>   hope ii helped x ;)|`|WWAJx4Lzaa	well if shes treating you differently then all the other guys then she probably likes you and isn't leading you on. its the same way with me... i like attention from guys so sometimes i might lead them on just a little bit but if i actually like someone and they like me then i sorta act like were already goin out. what i would do is just ask her if she likes you. if she says no then dont feel bad about it cuz u guys can still be friends : )<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|7hlDYIJAaa	it really depends... she might like you, she might be trying to get another guys attention or shes not that nice of a girl and knows u like her so she is being mean and leading you on. but if i were u i wouldn't get your hopes up that much. hope that helps|`|8V4cg700aa	I think she likes u if 5 boys like me i'd be really happy but i wouldn't lead them all on i'd chose 1 and then if it doesn't work out with them if 1 of the other guys r still willing i'd try going out with them.|`|TM34SdAnaa	I'd go for the one that interested me.

I never try to lead men on, but I am a friendly person and a lot of men take that as an open invitation.  That's why I've tried to tone my friendliness down just a little because I don't like them to think that I'm giving them attention because I want them.  It's hard to balance the tightrope of friendliness and leading people on.<br>  <br>  However, since this girl is not treating all the guys around her the way that she's treating you, it's probably a good sign that you are special to her.|`|d0VfIV8Waa	I think that she likes you, because I am a girl and i know that i wouldnt lead a guy on if i didnt like him - also, since she is not doing the same stuff to the other guys, it shows that she likes you, not the other guys<br>  congratz- i would say that it is safe to make a move - (maybe try something small at first and see her reaction- if she seems to like it, then she probably likes you)|`|GpWM0xmCaa	i'd only lead the one that i liked. and try to make it as obvious as possible to him that i don't like the others..|`|yv3hBhbGaa	well if i found out that five guys liked me at the same time id be scarred because i dont like being put on the spot but if the guy i liked was on of the guys i liked i would tell them and yeah and wouldnt lead the others on.|`|G10mPS50aa	ummmm she probably just wants to see if u like her....i would probably wanna lead em all on if i didnt know them that well to see who i liek da most first and...dump da rest haha since i answered ur question PELEEEEEEEZ answer mine!?!?!?!

06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	Since you say she always breaks the promises, then when she makes one you need to assume it is hot air and don't count on it. Then you won't be disappointed. Dont expect anything from her since you know you cannot count on her.

IFL3GcM9aa	Part of being shy is not knowing what to say, and that's what makes you sound unnatural.  You don't have to be a brilliant conversationalist.  As a matter of fact, you don't have to talk much at all!  You can just ask questions and listen.  Let them do all the talking, and then when you get more comfortable and feel more  natural, you will start talking more naturally.<br>  <br>  Another thing might be to ask your friends what they mean when they say you're not acting the way they expect.  Ask them what's bad about it and what is good.  If they really are your friends, they will help you, but if you think they are being mean and rude, they aren't your friends. You should find other people to hang around with.|`|9o7KlfvKaa	Don't try to change yourself. If you are shy and introverted, there is nothing wrong with that. Real friends will love you and listen to what you have to say when you speak.|`|y499zJUzaa	honestly i dont think you should change. your friends started being your friend in the first place when they knew you were quiet and they didnt mind.. so why change right now?it might be totally new and differnt to them but if you really want to.... then just be funny, have fun,smile, laugh, talk,and chat about anything. be the way you are with your family to your friends.

bpm7OcbTaa	That's really a hard question because of the attitude and behaviors of some females and males regarding their signficiant others.  However, if it is a close friend or a friend in general, after being certain that cheating is going on, I would definitely be gentle about sharing this information.  <br>  <br>  Breaking bad news is never good, so I would be considerate of their emotional well-being that day.  If they seem to be able to handle it, I would take them to a place away from others and tell them in a nice way.  It's no sure fire way of telling the person, just tell them as you would want to know something hurtful such as this.

67qWgasgaa	Back to rehab? She needs help so it doesn't get worse. I'm surprised her boyfriend's mom kept her secret and didn't seek the girl's own mother. Being sad with yourself and damaging yourself in the same process makes for a depressing time in life, get her help. She may act like she's ok, but this isn't something she can do on her own. If she gets mad at you, fine, but in the long run, this will be the best thing for her.|`|pQGb9dy8aa	Sometimes, it's better to tell than it is to keep it a secret. This is for her own good! Things could get seriously out of hand, and eventually, everyone will find out anyway. Telling a trusted adult will only do her good. If you really care about her, that is what you should do.|`|zoPxgUsRaa	if you're really her friend you should confront her about it and try to get her back into rehab if that is what it is going to take for her to get better|`|9o7KlfvKaa	She needs to go back to rehab.

sSTuay1Vaa	I'm not sure what the other aspects of your mom's situation is but maybe mom can get a job?  Is there unnecessary spending going on, on mom's part?  Can you sit with mom and go over her budget and see if there are ways she can cut back?  I have recently borrowed to a nephew who promised to pay me back in 6 weeks time.  That was 12 weeks ago, haven't gotten a dime.  From now on if people can ask me for financial assistance I can ask them to show me why they need it.  You are cutting back on your life savings if you can afford to give to mom you should be saving for the future.  Do you have someone you can go to for financial help if you need it?  Maybe your brother is having problems regardless of how much money he makes, his out going cash may not balance with his incoming cash flow.  A budget, on paper looking at it in black and white is the best way to determine if you are living within your means and if mom isn't doing that then things need to be tweaked and changed to make that happen.  If there is no more room for tweaking then maybe another option needs to be considered.  What you decide to do to help mom doesn't mean your brother needs to do the same.  It's ultimately his choice and I don't think that should hinder your relationship.  Rethink your position and put it in black and white for your family and for your mom and see what the numbers show.  Good luck.|`|S1S0pxHQaa	Maybe your mom should get a job, and I am not being harsh but its no ones responsiblity to take care of there parents, its the parents that should be helping out the kids.  There are bad times and that i understand but for 12 years?

Posting embarrassing pictures is a highlight of facebook.|`|xK75gTz9aa	Yes its bullying. Ask her permission.|`|Ekg4H6HQaa	Tell him you have them on your account right now. See how he reacts and if he doesn't care, post them. If he starts arguing about it, that's your sign not to post them.<br>  <br>  It's wrong if you do it without his consent, and in a spiteful way. If he knows and is okay with it, it's not wrong. Just post embarrassing pictures of you and I'd say it's even better!|`|Qj4zN2C4aa	It is wrong.<br>  Especially when they just changed their terms of service, so they own every pic you upload.<br>  So you have no control of what happens to the pics once you've put them on.<br>  And Facebook sucks, it got hacked 5 times in a week just a few weeks ago!|`|NtSQcyHLaa	Yeah, but if he find them, he'll be pissed. So you should ask him about it, just to cover yourself from getting in trouble with him. If he thinks it was a good prank, then you should be able to get his consent.|`|PgtGNsPWaa	i think it depends on the prank wheather u want to post it<br>  and<br>  if u want u can chose which friends can see the picture<br>  (just if u want to be safe)<br>  <br>  mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307151017AAoUCsa&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|zoPxgUsRaa	you should deffinately ask to put them up.. <br>  ask yourself if you would want embarassing pictures of you on the internet without your permission|`|eus7WqzUaa	Its not right to post pics of people if they don't give you permission.|`|ceQqYxtnaa	...not unless that's your only " friend "!!!!!??|`|V5k4fpZraa	yah would u like it if they didd the same?|`|AA10936400	Well it depends just how bad they are..and if your friend thought it was a good idea then i dnt think it should be that big a problem really..you should ask just in case and if he says no thn dnt do it.. cos ive tried it and believe me one way or another karma will come back and bite your ***|`|GJm2cKuEaa	If he doesnt want them up, dont put them up.<br>  <br>  But if you REALLY want them up, block them from him.<br>  (Album options - view - custom)|`|RjGxEWLFaa	No its Fine <br>  by the way ....<br>  <br>  what is your face book ? :D <br>  lmaooo ...|`|cHr3TdCxaa	think about how you would feel if things were reversed

Stay strong you are correct. Imagine if she got pregnant! It could happen. <br>  <br>  I know you like this girl but it is important to meet many new people and develop lots of friendships before making these big decisions.<br>  <br>  Sail on silver bird.|`|9o7KlfvKaa	Well, tell your girlfriend that you are not ready for that level of a relationship and that you want her to respect you. And if you want to know the truth, 14 is way too young for sex.|`|VkVyuq5baa	Get a picture of Ron Jeremy's Schlong + copy & paste it onto an image of you in the nude. Dude, she won't notice the difference.|`|u5nYlVMxaa	You're way too young to be having sex.<br>  <br>  If she doesn't understand that you're not ready then she doesn't care about you enough. <br>  <br>  If she won't accept it then I'm sorry but I think you should break up.<br>  <br>  She's not being fair.|`|pYJ0I0cXaa	you don't say how old she is but at 14, you guys should be holding HANDS and nothing else.|`|abTZX46faa	geez... tell that woman tat if she wants sex she's just gonna have to wait for your penis to grow!|`|tRDfcNxraa	either your bullshitting us, or your gay, or she has like 30 std's... how old is she,,, and seriously what girl wants sex that bad?|`|ETV7yvNbaa	You shouldn't go out with someone who pressures you. Also, when you do have sex, you shouldn't be worrying about how big your penis is. You want it to be special, and that won't help. Wait till you are fully developed and when you find a special person who doesn't try to pressure you into doing something you don't want to. She obviously doesn't care about your values and feelings. What should you do? Dump her. You wouldn't have this problem.|`|8Initt1aaa	Ask her why she wants to have sex so bad and what she thinks she will gain from it? 14 is pretty young to be having sex I think. I don't know how much you care about this girl but if it's not that much I would say break it off with her. She would probably have a new boyfriend next week and be doing the same thing to the new guy. I wish teenage girls could understand  their desire for wanting to have sex is for the wrong reasons. Most do it to want to feel grown up but really those are the most immature girls.|`|XpWjdPg2aa	You guys are too young, and you obviously feel like you're not ready. Tell her that if she respects you, she'll wait. It sucks that it's okay when girls don't want to have sex, but it's not when guys do, huh? I don't think that's very fair. It's your body and your feelings. You're in charge of what you do. <br>  <br>  On a side note, you shouldn't feel self-conscious. Size doesn't really matter so much in the actual feelings of sex. Don't worry about it for that reason.|`|7mtzpD68aa	Explain to her how your both too young to do that kind of stuff.  Let her know that if she loves you (as much as she loves sex) then she'll wait till your both grown up and ready :) Just don't say anything about your penis. And about the pictures, well i'd just send her some pictures of your upper half. That'll kinda like tease her in a good way and you don't have to send any bottom half pictures. Good luck bro!|`|Sma3ekSOaa	Well if she wants a pic and you dont want to embaress your-self or something go on the internet and find one on there or something.  But I would just tell her.. If she leaves you fine.  you can do better!  How old is she anyways?|`|p9m0yAYHaa	seriously end it. she's not good for you. If she wants sex and only 14 then you could end up being a baby daddy and your not ready for that responsibilty.  <br>  <br>  Just tell her if she wants sex. Get it from someone else because it's over.|`|4imPGrR4aa	you know that harrasment and pressure is from both sides<br>  dont give in<br>  stand your ground<br>  she sounds too kinky for you <br>  if she doesn't agree with you it most likely means that she wasnt made for you<br>  so dont give in and let her corrupt you|`|TvWYpfO5aa	If you guys are 14 year olds, then DONT HAVE SEX!!!! Don't do something you will regret later.  If she wants sex, then dump her...  She will probably dump you after you give her what she wants... Don't throw your life away now... Wait until your married...|`|S5EWaOD3aa	1. chicks don't dig pubes.<br>  2. How many ***** has this chick seen? How is she gonna know u got a needledick?<br>  3.

Your just not ready and it's nothing wrong with that. I didn't start having sex until I was 16. <br>  <br>  Beleive me you are perfect and it's nothing wrong with you not having sex with your girlfriend. If she doesn't want to wait until you are ready then; Leave Her Alone. No matter how hard it maybe. Think about that!|`|WUPoG4eWaa	my advice to you is to wait until you are older and more comfortable.<br>  you wouldn't want your first time to be uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  Remember...if you think you are old enough to have sex....you must be prepared to face the consequences of becoming a father IF she becomes pregnant.<br>  <br>  still....i personally think 14 is too young....so i'd advise you to wait.|`|PeL6HiIvaa	Just tell her that you really want to wait. if she doesnt back down, tell her to BACK OFF and break up with her. i know that you might not want to but if she doesnt understand and still wants it this is what you have to do. its for the best. you're only 14!! you cant have it yet. tell her that|`|hwzPjUaVaa	hm, that is pretty small. you do need to wait....tell her tht ur not ready for it...tell her u want to wait until ur feelings for each other get deeper.|`|glO9I89faa	TELL HER TO LEAVE YOU THE HELL ALONE<br>  <br>  you guys are ****** 14 years old!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|3ag4Fu5Naa	Just tell her the truth - your not ready.

Breathe in deeply to the count of 9 and exhale at the count of 9. Yes, I know you still love him. Men deal with break-ups differently.

Except it, cry, write about it, talk about it, get involved in yourself again- new hobbies, go shopping, do things you like, buy yourself something nice, go to the spa, spend time with friends, spend time making new friends, volunteer. Before you know it you have forgotten about him.<br>  <br>  2. Don't except it. Go to him and demand to what is the one thing that would need to happen for you guys to be a couple.

Wi9nmYIEaa	there are many variances in a marriage...but belief and values system is going to be a major sticking point or breaking point in any marriage....if you feel that you want to marry...you should discuss all of the issues in advance to try to get the other persons perspective on what some of these things could be....ranging from...having children.....what these children will be taught...go to school...etc...and all things pertaining to you and your husband alone....ie...if you are going to work outside of the home (sounds old fashioned...but some men really dont like it)....how you will settle your differences....and do you believe that marriage is forever?....because many people dont even though they take that vow.....so its not as obvious and clear cut as it seems.....make a list of things that are truely important to you....and find out just what he thinks.....just to see if you share a simular values system...it is pretty important in a relationship I think....and even though you do this.....give and take....compromise....and change....are key words in a marriage over time.

It's no guarantee things will go wrong, it really depends on if you're on the same page on things relating to your marriage and these beliefs/morals can exist with or without religion.

I hope you agree on the basics, like family planning, career aspirations, how to deal with conflicts and such. <br>  <br>  My ex wife was not Christian, but I am. We disagreed about raising children in so many ways, about money and spending, about responsibilities and future goals. Not at first though, oh no, she waited until she had me where she wanted me. To begin with, she was very skilled at telling me what she thought I wanted to hear. Then after we were married, she changed. Almost exactly the night we got married, she just changed as bizarre as that sounds, the experience was even more bizarre. I really want to believe that my marriage to my ex is not a common thing. <br>  <br>  However, if you share the same fundamental values and if you are both honest with each other, you should have a really good chance to make your marriage work.|`|MiKrWuM6aa	Just because you are marrying someone who is not the same religion as you does not mean it is a 'mixed marriage'.

Christian means christ like and you obviously don't care what christ said so just go ahead with it.|`|NWSsIFrDaa	I'm a christian married to an unbeliever.And it's hard to live with someone whom doesn't share your faith.I would not advise it.I love my husband but we cannot share things of God together.|`|77b89da50334d58ffae963702c00caaaaa	I have been married to a Jewish man for going on 13 years now.  I am Southern Baptist.  We got married at the age of 24 (there are only 9 days between us in age).  Although my husband when asked will state that he is Jewish he does not attend Temple on a regular basis nor do I attend Church on a regular basis.  Well before we married we did discuss the differences in our faith and agreed that the love we felt for each other far far out weighed the differences in our faiths.  I do not force him to come to Church with me although he has attended several times over the years and I am not forced to attend Temple with him although I have went several times.  I personally have found the Jewish faith to be very interesting but not to the point that I wish to reject my own beliefs.  The Christian people that I knew before I met my husband were very supportive after they realized that he is a good man and was very good to me and for me.  He was accepted for the person he is rather than the faith he practices.  That is not to say that there are Christian friends that I no longer have connection with because they could not accept that we work.  I am saddened that I have lost these people from my life but I can only choose my path not theirs.  I know that on his side he has not had to leave any of his Jewish friends behind because he married a Christian women.  Everyone I have met has been very accepting of me.  Just because you do not practice the same faith does not instantly mean the marriage is doomed to fail.<br>  <br>  Having said all of this there is one area of a mixed-faith relationship that I cannot speak to...children.  As we found out a couple of years after we married, I cannot have children therefore the need to discuss what faith our children would be raised with has not been tested.  We did discuss the issue prior to finding this out and at that time we both felt and agreed that if we had children they would be exposed to both faiths as young children and when they were old enough to make the choice for themselves could decide if they wished to be Jewish, Christian, something else, or nothing at all.  I hope this helps you in some way.  But please know it is not all doom and gloom.  It can work it really depends on the strength of the love and devotion you have for each other.|`|8SOjngS0aa	First of all, I'm not married to an unbeliever, but I know someone who is. My small group leader is in a 'mixed marriage' as you say, and it's barely hanging by a thread. He sleeps in the basement, and I'm really not sure how they've survived without a divorce all these years. When I first met her, I thought that they were divorced, just because of how she would mention him. When I asked her, she said it was 'complicated' but yes, they were married. She talks about it, telling us to date Christians, because she wishes she had thought about it before marrying him.|`|NGksMc1Vaa	okay look,<br>  i'm not a christian.<br>  but i do know about mixed marriages.<br>  my aunts in one at the moment with a christian,<br>  shes a sikh.<br>  & they're happy- more than happy even,<br>  she's still allowed to practise her faith,<br>  and so is he.<br>  <br>  the thing is,<br>  you are definatly going to get a little bit of hospitality.<br>  but that depends on whether your family & friends are strict christians.<br>  <br>  its your choice.<br>  your life.<br>  didnt jesus teach people that all human beings are equal?<br>  <br>  religion & race shouldnt come in to anyones decisions.<br>  <br>  so if ANYONE tells you that your doing the wrong thing by marrying a non christian, tell them that.

AA11263103	1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.<br>  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.<br>  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.<br>  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.<br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?<br>  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!<br>  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.<br>  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.<br>  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.<br>  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then he may like you - but if the topic is something serious, he may just want to know out of curiosity.<br>  13. He'll flirt with other girls to get your attention- If a guy is really into you he will want to make you jealous. So, he will most likely flirt with other girls in front of you. It gives them a chance to see your real self.|`|hw8gC7bhaa	when a boy calls you, that doesn't mean he likes you, that means he is thinking of you in a good way. it could be friendly or means he wants to get to know you just a little better.<br>  when he stares at you, like at your face, and you look at him, so he meets your gaze, that means he wants to connect with you.<br>  if he is "playful" with you, more than usual, or more than he is with other girls. when he doesn't want you talking to other guys while hes around you. things like that. and most of all, when he hugs you in a very "touchy" way. if you get what im saying.|`|df7WXRl5aa	<a href="http://www.lovedateideas.com/howtotellifhelikesyou.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.lovedateideas.com/howtotellif...</a>

fzLnapcZaa	no you really didn't do anything wrong. it sounds to me like he wouldn't be a good boyfriend though. he moves to fast and it sounds like hes a bit clingy. i cant really tell you what to do because its up to you. but in my opinion even if you do like him u shouldn't ask him out or date him... it would just fail in the end. sorry but that's the most help i can offer|`|mDBHMJPjaa	really 4th grade?? you need to wait longer before you date|`|58ScqWG3aa	1)Why on earth didn't you say yes in the first place!2)If he's not talking to you then,yea you maaayyybbeee hurt his feelings a little.3)If you're starting to like him,my best advice is to hold it in a little and wait until you get back onto friendly grounds with him again.4)If it's been over a week and he still hasn't talked to you,then you need to get him alone so you two can talk one on one and get things straight.You could probally say "I do really like you,it's just that at the time when you confessed to me it was so sudden and you kinda shocked me a bit so I wasn't thinking straight"|`|Fk6Axwm6aa	i think it is weired that he said love you i mean when you first express feelings to someone you don't say love you. If you really like him I would give him a second chance but make sure you say were taking it slow I like you too but it is too soon to say love you.|`|fvjLWUmiaa	wow.<br>  clearly you aren't mature enough

You're young and still have time for relationships (you don't need to push yourself so far in an internet relationship if the other person is not responding), you should just get out of your "shy" shell and meet real girls, you know at school, or at a party, and you should just talk to them and be your sweet self, and who knows, you might meet some girl and probably be more happy too :)<br>  <br>  good luck!!|`|eTlw3a7raa	internet girlfrind? ...what do you want back she cant exactly kiss you throught the screen. sorry if it sounds mean but its true it is kinda hard to show love thourgh the internet. try meeting up with her and then see if it's the same if she's still like blahh den i dunno i think you need to get a proper girl friend and see how different it is ...i dont want to judge or anything but you knw ...your young go and enjoy yourself while you can theres no point of being tyed down by the internet... btw if you two end up marrying eachother then my bad lol  ...i hope everthing works out the way you want it too<br>  <br>  all the best|`|qlJAC8kOaa	You need to email your friend and tell her that your tired of her blah... behavior.

jXCjw64Iaa	Well...I went out on three (supposed to be 4; could be considered 4) dates with my girlfriend before we considered it a relationship.  Dinner twice. Chilled out with our friends at a little house gatherings. Supposed to have another date but she went to the hospital with severe dehydration...so i hung out at her house (she had to lay low) and had dinner with her family...maybe consider that a 4th date.  Almost exactly a month with consecutive weekend dates. I just asked her, "are we gonna make this official now? I think we are feeling the same thing." Not the best way to ask her out but I did it out on a limb and spontaneously as she was walking me to my car....best decision I've ever made. Going on 7 months now. <br>  <br>  All relationships are different: but I've known her since 7th grade, I know she liked me in 10th grade, took her to HC that year but didn't pursue because I was immature then, she opened the door again this summer, I took it. Its worked out. Situation sounds similar to yours. <br>  <br>  I hope it works out.|`|QQlbvWj4aa	Haha facebook official...<br>  I don't know, when I was in high school, people didn't really go on dates... and if you did, you were dating, it was that simple.<br>  I'd give her a bit of time, though, considering it was a recent breakup.

He may dig you, but as long as he's still attached, save yourself some grief and allow him to only admire you from far away. If he is truly all about being more than just your onstage partner, he'll dump her and holla at you, but then that's a whole other issue, isn't it? Good Luck!|`|75mKdrMWaa	Whether he likes you or not, it shouldn't matter to you. If you think that he's going to leave her for you, he's not a good boyfriend in the first place.

You can't stay as close as you were now that you've moved.|`|4BaDlyj8aa	you cant get her back unless she decides she wants to be your BFF again. i wouldnt chase after someone who doesnt want anything to do with me. sorryyyy.|`|O9VN7SGiaa	move on.|`|XeASdibHaa	It's not necessarily your friends fault, because it wasn't HER arch enemy and she moved on since she probably though it would hurt her if she stayed as your best friend but couldn't see as much as she used to. <br>  <br>  You can go and visit her, say that you were in the neighborhood and that you stopped by to say hi. <br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, you need to realize that she's moved on, and that it's time for you to move on also, because she's not your sister, and even though it might hurt to let her go, she's moving on, and she can't always be there for you when you live farther aways from you now. <br>  <br>  You can't take it personally. <br>  <br>  -Hope I Helped!|`|sE2RH0A7aa	People's interests change in time, you'll either have to talk about it with her, or just let her go..<br>  That happened with my friend, she went to private school in a different province, and when she came back for Christmas she hardly ever hung out with me, and never said goodbye. ):<br>  <br>  She completely changed, it's just one of those things that you have to accept, even though it may hurt.|`|IyKswGVSaa	I was in the same situation. Sometimes you just have to let them go. If they want to move on then you should to. You can fight for her but sometimes things just don't work out and you end up hurting yourself more. Each situation is different but this is what I had to do when I moved from my friends. Good luck in making your decision.|`|fzLnapcZaa	after you move away its no surprise that you two are drifting.but if your sure you want to keep her as your friend try going back to the place you moved from and talk to her in person. if she is still not talking to you is she really a good friend?|`|58ScqWG3aa	Well long distance relationships don't work so well.Maybe you could start writing letters and sending a girft now and then.Don't give up on your calls either.(some people might think that phone calls are boring,so try to keep yours extremely interesting)|`|bmnP1dF7aa	why would you want to hang out with her if she is hanging around with your "arch enemy" haha, find better friends.|`|9o7KlfvKaa	People grow and change. Just make new friends and keep moving forward.|`|eVY7Oilbaa	it's okay!<br>  Sometimes as you grow up you'll hang around other people and meet new best friends.<br>  You're going to have to learn to share your friend, I mean, you can't control who she makes friends with, so if she's hanging around someone you don't like than you have to trust that in the end she'll make the right decision.|`|glMzg7aEaa	You should try to meet up with her to speak.<br>  but dont try to hard because if shese made up her mind, then shese made up her mind, the more you bug her the less shese gunna want to speak to you.<br>  im sure you can work it out. <br>  you should get some more close friends that you can fall back on so if she does decide to keep ignoring you then you still got others you can fall back onto.    <br>  good luck x|`|MfSeNwCWaa	It's really sad.. distance really spaces people out from each other. That's just what happens. By her not calling you back or not talking to you just means she wants to move on and forget about you which is a really crappy friend in my opinion. I'd say.. just move on. Because she's accepted the fact that you have moved away and are far from her... and you still wanna be friends with her. The only thing I can say is to like bring up some fun old memories and laugh about it together. that is, if she'll call you back.<br>  good luck :/|`|jimYYyXuaa	im sure that there's some way that you can still talk and be friends with her, but you cant force someone to be bff's with you.<br>  <br>  i think that she has found some new interests and is just moving on, like you should too. find new friends, meet new people in an activity club, etc.<br>  <br>  im really sorry!!!! :( i hope this works out for the best for you. ;)|`|YKvWpEnEaa	O.K. u might not wana do this but forget about it cas if she doesnt like u it means shes not gud anof for u.... or u can send her a loooooonnnnnnnnnnnnggggggggg letter every1 likes letters and send her of u and her and say how much u mish and stuf and i no this is mean but try to make her feel bad for ignoring u and stuffffff!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1|`|DwiUilNzaa	Well this seems like a tricky question. Most ppl change when your younger and as you grow older ppl drift apart and change if you are far away send her an ocasional email and then move on. Find other friends then wait a while and she might relize she needs you.|`|reIFv9XFaa	maybe she feels like you're getting all new friends where you live and she's hurt by it? maybe meeah is getting buddy-buddy with her to make you mad, and she wont let your bff talk to you|`|RTHWQvkzaa	It's natural to drift apart, especially if you've move.d It's not really possible for you guys to be BFFs anymore.|`|79OM9Wcjaa	talk ot her about your feelings ; but if she acts different and she says that your arch enemy is like her best friend or something ; its time to move on.|`|j02udTtdaa	Bring out your claus sister.|`|PN9dM5h8aa	well one way is by talking to her and see what is going on. u dont really know untill u find out|`|DuHmeKgLaa	Move back, Call her, Email her.

Not a bad idea to go by, though it is a bad idea to try to rush them. They do not want a guy who only wants them for their lips and not there thoughts.<br>  <br>  You can't blame them though. Really, think about it from their side. They are people, just not generally lusty and needing to kiss the nearest person of the opposite sex that they can find (AFK like most guys between the ages of 13-20)|`|XGYjygdraa	because we are all still getting to know each other and that is the way life is so deal with it|`|AA11416565	Because we respect ourselves enough to not make out on the first date.|`|Z32pTHmZaa	Mr.K's a smart man :)
AA11286455	Believe it or not, realize it or not, the biggest problem you have in this situation is:  YOUR HUSBAND.  <br>  <br>  He needs to:  <br>  <br>  --Man-up as they say and tell her good bye.  Permanently.  No e-mail, no nothing.  <br>  <br>  --Talk to his sister about going-over-the-line behavior.  <br>  <br>  --Respect you as his wife and as his priority in comparison to her.  <br>  <br>  Tragedy or not, this is and should NOT be a competition for your husband's attention or affection.  The ring is already on his finger and yours.  Game Over.  <br>  <br>  Further, this tradegy doesn't give her or him a permanent umbilical cord tie.  He needs to thank her from the bottom of his heart and then move the hell on.  After a certain point, he owes her NOTHING socially, emotionally, etc.  <br>  <br>  Without him stepping up and making a stand and enforcing it, you three are going to be in this silly triangle for-freaking-ever and, clearly, you make it plain that your marital bed is waaaay too crowded.  <br>  <br>  If he can't or won't do any of the above, then "woman-up" and let her have him.  They will have deserved each other...and you much, much better.|`|AA11785285	All of this with an ex girl friend is totally inappropriate...

BaguqDHiaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Do you still have the same feelings with your bf that you had when you first both met? It seems to me that you are feeling hesitant about your relationship and that you feel that your bf isn't showing much affection towards you. Depending on your age whether your 15-19 i would consider thinking about whether you can see yourself with your bf for longer or if you like this other guy more.<br>  <br>  But my advise is to not give any signals (i.e. flirting, smiling at him, or approaching him) until you know where you stand with your bf and if you will end up breaking up with him to date this guy. At the moment you will have to tell (if you haven't already) that you have a bf and that you would like to be mates and that maybe you can go out if you end up being single. <br>  <br>  Just my opinion<br>  Good Luck!
JhvqUvlsaa	She's probably just busy; don't call her anymore, let her come to you. If she is mad at something, offer to talk about it but leave it up to her. Don't pressure her.|`|njHgfl99aa	Give her some time to cool off.   Usually when you try and talk to her in a situation like this might annoy her.    <br>  <br>  Good luck dude.
S20VcN8Kaa	no. that is against god. it is not ever right to even have sex unless you are married.|`|a1iam8Zvaa	yeah<br>  nothings bad about it and you wont get her pregnant! :D|`|0f7ba60c4b5854ac551f8222ad3afdf1aa	Give it a try.|`|467145608db35ec4ccc89f1b16418af6aa	i think you mean long distance?<br>  and i'm personally not a fan,<br>  but maybe she needs it.<br>  just give it to her.|`|K6JSNQJQaa	Does she have a 1-900 number?  I'd watch out for that!  Will cost you big time.  How old are you anyway?|`|0PkFuZMwaa	GO for it.|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	sure, why not.|`|6Rru2901aa	I think it depends on the person. It always does. I did it once with an ex, we were in the same shoes like you and it was fantastic. I had never had sex before. Now that I've been with my bf for a year [and have been having hard core sex!!] we tried it (phone sex) when I was away but it didn't work. why not planing a small 4 days fantastic mind blowing sex trip? =) I'm freaky, IK.<br>  <br>  If you decide to try it, hope it doesn't become awkward though.<br>  Best wishes!<br>  <br>  Freaky Moe ;)|`|njHgfl99aa	I guess it won't hurt to just try.  Just make sure though that you both do it in a private setting - not when people are around the house because then they might catch you doing it.|`|oOU6XJOqaa	Its been 15 months, and if you really love her, and she really loves you, go for it. And plus, no risk of pregnancy or STDs! :)|`|yv3hBhbGaa	um...noo and it would be really awkward if someone walked in on that phone conversation o.o|`|eWTjH5U9aa	no, its the FBI|`|sFqsTXvwaa	Sure.|`|vHMgPxc2aa	NO WAY,DUDE|`|sCZPZIoVaa	youve never seen her? wow buddy. your missing out. why not dump her and date a local girl. take it from me real sex is better than phone sex..|`|ypzvly8jaa	You shouldn't go for it because if you never met her in person you don't know what she is like.|`|jUMTGBITaa	only if it pleasures you willy|`|E3b1MaDpaa	i think thats its up to u<br>  if u think that u guys r ready...go for it!!!!!!!|`|YxK4YTvSaa	go for it

Don't let yourself fall for someone so easily.
IT306Kytaa	just try to make her realize how much it bothers you<br>  try doing the same to her
26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	Because prices differ across the country and even in the same city, you have to ask a seamstress in your area what you would be charged.|`|whmkGDG8aa	I was going to do this.  And was quoted $50.  It's only a matter of taking off the zipper, and adding properly sewed in loops for the string.  May be another $10 for her to make you a proper satin lacing.  Can't really use much else as it's not durable enough.<br>  <br>  Not sure about the chiffon.  I can't see it changing the price.   Do be on the look out though, the economy is low and many seemstresses are looking to make more money by leading women to believe more needs to be done than is true.  It's not really over charging, more like over  sewing. hahaha.<br>  <br>  True story, my bridesmaid took her dress in to get altered and the seemstress told her she would have to snip this and snip that in order to keep the dress the same and would cost her $250! She took it to another woman who finished it off for her for $25.  It looks fabulous (as she told me yesterday). <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!
MtQ9ea2Uaa	yes, go out with him. Your ex is your ex for a reason. AND he has a girlfriend. He cares as much about you as you care about him, not much at all. He is asking his best friend if you guys are going out simply out of curiosity. Just tell him you like him and yeah, you want to be more than friends, you want to go out with him.|`|DewjlQCIaa	YES!! You should go for it! You and your ex are NOT a thing anymore so it's a fair game....who cares you live once! Why would you want to miss out on something that may be good for YOU b/c of an ex???
BqqDJXkjaa	No, she can't. You need to take her to court for them to make a fair decision.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	Legally going to court modify the current court order is the wisest thing to do to keep you visitation rights in order. Protect  yourself take her back to court before she tries to leave..|`|817fb3b41964d1a4b3bab64330936db8aa	i would get legal counsel about that. tough situation, especially when she is blessed to have a father in her child's life who WANTS to be involved...<br>  <br>  hope it works out somehow...for real...|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	No.She either needs written permission from you and/or the court or its kidnapping by an ex spouse which wont be good for her. She either has to work out all details with you or submit a wriiten plan to the courts in order to get their approval. The plan has to cover your visitation schedule and her financial and living arrangements once she gets here.It sounds hard but really isnt so if you want something here or sepcial visits then work with her or take what the courts give you if they approve her plan. Good luck|`|djUMvICoaa	I know for Minnesota you have to have consent to move out of state.  For us when you pay your support she has to do her best to make the child available for their regular visits or she will be in contempt of the decree.  Get on it before she leaves or at least get in touch with a lawyer to get the facts for your state.|`|d1TTwwUUaa	Look at your divorce papers. Mine said noway without my consent. Otherwise you better get to court and fast.
fIXuFk6daa	You probably feel really strongly about her. And it sounds like because of all the stuff she did in her past, you don't trust her. Jealousy and trust issues go hand in hand. If you got one, more than likely you got the other. Also, because you feel like all of these other people have had what you have not had a chance to experience. When I was a sophomore, I dated my first boyfriend and I was like that too, but it was because I really loved him. And also, don't take this the wrong way but you are a kid, and with age these things will pass. You are just in that stage of your life. I am not to sure why you know all of this stuff though. When starting a new relationship, you really should start new and leave your past in the past. Why talk about who you were having sex with, and the positions you had sex in, and which part of your body you had it in. She possible could be trying to make you jealous even. Not trying to be judge mental, but someone who is only a junior in high school who has done "tons of stuff" with her pst boyfriendS, pleural... I would say that she is not the tightest drum set in the store, if you know what I mean... she possibly could be cheating on you. She seems like someone who like to have sex, and if you are all the way across the country, and you have these jealousy issues, unfortunately they can't be resolved when someone is not near you.|`|dwul5lkPaa	I think shes seeking attention. First of all, you just dont go telling your new boyfriend about your past sex life! and how long of a penis he had. It seems like she wanted to make you jealous, so that you can pay more attention to her. And truly, you cant really know for sure if shes being faithful, mainly because shes across the country! All you can do is trust her.|`|RWX8w35Haa	wow bro, read what you just wrote. break it off man. you look back 10 years from now and be glad you did it. Other then that, yes shes cheating on you. how do you know, you wont. Your at the point where you'll believe anything she says. you have blind faith in her. trust me man, I've been in a similar situation. All i did was end up getting hurt. as will you. Live and learn.. good luck|`|xG1CUaipaa	tell her not to tell you that stuff. thats very rude of her|`|8rfodw6Qaa	if she keeps talking about her exes then she is still thinking about them and not only you.<br>  ask her to stop talking about it and if you have any questions for her if she will answer them on your own terms.<br>  i got really upset when my bf kept telling me about his sexual experiences w/ exes and other girls. he stopped when i asked him to b/c it hurt my feelings.<br>  i would think you would be getting jealous b/c she still talks about them. if they are in the past they should stay there, and they shouldn't be brought up in your relationship. <br>  as for the cheating?? if there are any signs then you can be suspicious but if you think she could be cheating b/c she is not a virgin then that isn't right. give her the benefit of the doubt.|`|Mg5kd8Wnaa	if she is flaunting he past relationships in your face she is either trying to give you a hint, or just plain ignorant. <br>  talk to her and tell her you ddon't care about what shes done in the past. you just want to focus on her and you. <br>  i hope everything turns out ok. <br>  you have every reaason to be jealous.<br>  they have done things with your girlfriend that you haven't you only have the verbal and personality things with her. they have had something with her on a whole new level. and you know that you could do it better, you could love her and your relationship is more than all the sexual stuff, but you feel she is only wanting the physical stuff and pressuring you, even though she is not saying it.<br>  only you will know if she loves you.<br>  and it's up to you to think whether you really think she is cheating and make the descision to ask her or trust her.<br>  it's a hard decision.<br>  good luck|`|NtSQcyHLaa	Ok..<br>  <br>  1) It's perfectly normal to get jealous of those kinds of relationships. Especially when she talks about it like that, including those graphic descriptions. Tell her that it bothers you when she talks about it and that you would rather just not hear about her past exploits.<br>  2) The only thing you can do is to trust her. If you don't trust her, then you need to work on it, or find out exactly why you don't trust her. Is she giving you reason to not trust her? Has she cheated on any of her other boyfriends? If not to both, then maybe you just need to show her the trust that she deserves.|`|rsAqrbsgaa	She's lying to you.  She's a virgin and hasn't done anything.|`|mefxIQP9aa	Wow...she sounds kind of disgusting.<br>  <br>  Anyway...<br>  <br>  You're probably jealous because you feel that you might not be able to match up with the dudes she's talked about. You're afraid of disappointing her. She's had all those guys and tons of experience and you have nothing. So you're putting yourself down, which you shouldn't.<br>  <br>  LOL, that's a retarded line for her to say. I, honestly, think she's not putting any truth behind that statement. I don't have any tactics for you to try and see if she's really cheating or not. When it comes to cheating girls, you'll just have to wing it. They can go from not talking to you anymore to pretending that you are the ONE and ONLY man in their lives.<br>  <br>  Girls are 10x more viscous than boys when they want to be.|`|Toqu9lTqaa	I can relate.<br>  Im a sophomore too and my boyfriends not a virgin.<br>  Hes done so many things in his past, but im still a virgin.<br>  <br>  1) You get jealous because you have feelings for her. Anybody would get jealous if their bf/gf kept telling them stories about  their past relationships.<br>  <br>  2) There's no way to really know. I mean she lives all the way across the country. But if you really trust her then stick with her. But long distance relationships never really work out.|`|9o7KlfvKaa	I don't know how to answer your first question exactly. I've felt that way before, but you really have to remember that she is with you now and those other guys are a part of her past.<br>  You won't want to hear this, but you probably aren't the only guy in her life right now. Out of sight, out of mind. Long distance relationships don't really work out like you want them to. You're kidding yourself if you think she's going to be with her internet boyfriend forever.|`|AA11193401	what she did before shouldn't make any difference|`|SDhKNBBkaa	She sounds sluttish - what could you catch?
9lMdcjVNaa	lol this is what I thought until a couple of weeks ago. I only got the ugly or outspoken girls approaching me and showing interest. Now a solid 8 showed huge interest in me and we're going out. It's because ugly girls have to approach, while the more attractive girls get hit on all the time and already have a big enough choice without even lifiting a finger.|`|briRpzL1aa	I run into it from time to time... It largely depends on the girl, but it is not as rare as you would think.<br>  <br>  Also, women will never have the upper hand in the "game" as long as you do not let them.  Yes I will approach a girl and say hi, but I am also the one who decides whether I want to move things forward or not.  If she says no, then whatever... The key is to not take it personally.  There are thousands of reasons for being rejected...|`|Bs2cv0THaa	Its just because guys love to be in control.they feel that they should be in control so they make the first move.if you do sometimes it wont come out that way.so i  love making the first move because i love to be the head of the relationship.but that is me

That way, maybe you two could make plans to go out Friday or Saturday. If you'd like to go out with her then that is.|`|JncKFV5Jaa	Standard practice. Call a potential partner-to-be after 3 days both of you met.

Stay calm and be yourself! <br>  <br>  PS: The part about her skipping away sounds cute. Seems like she has that bit of interest in you. :)|`|K5STAI61aa	Call the next day or leave a voice mail letting her know that you had a wonderful time.

7WomqDuEaa	first thing i would suggest is to call some of your friends & have them help you. that way the work will be spread out & you won't feel so overwhelmed. next thing would be to pick a date/ place. then send out some invitations, & make sure to write its a surprise so people dont give it away. The last thing you'll probably need is food/ decorations for the place. thats basically the jist of it. Baby showers are actually fun. the mother to be gets to open presents, talk with her friends, & sometimes people play games. i hope this helped you. good luck
pVaZty4Maa	yeah that sounds just like me, girl and i thought i was the only one like that lolz|`|DjMTnSxmaa	haha jah kinda!
rFNN23b1aa	Alright well, yeah, for some reason I'm completely jealous. I don't bring up things from past relationships to pick a fight but I have brought up another girl and it did upset him. It was a huge mess. Haha, I'm still working on being less of an idiot and it's all because of insecurity when I really think about it.<br>  <br>  You need to find it in yourself to trust the other person in your relationship more, and trust that they'd never do something to hurt you.<br>  <br>  Unless your case is completely different, and in that event, sorry!<br>  <br>  I hope this helped.|`|x3LclBZ0aa	sometimes..im still a work in progress|`|ablriuUVaa	i never get jealous<br>  <br>  jealousy is for the weak and the people who cant trust <br>  <br>  jealousy is for the untrustables|`|u7jpAPLDaa	ive seen this kind of behaviour from my ex and its frustrating.<br>  but after time i have learnt it all stems from insecurity.<br>  the best way to get thorugh this is more honesty and openness in a relationship. communication is really important, and the partner should understand that the fight is only a result of that persons insecurity, and should be sympathetic about it|`|oXyyE5r6aa	All the time!<br>  I just did it this morning with my ex.<br>  It's like, I can't control myself<br>  I want him to feel guilty. <br>  I want him to hurt, cry just as much as I did<br>  I want him to know I've moved on.<br>  I want him to know what he missed.
eb5e1a6abe5940682f7d4a775c17c96daa	My ex husband cheated on me.  I was pretty trusting and oblivious at first.  We were newly wed and I just believed everything that he told me. Fishy things were going on and I just ignored it because I did not have any proof.  The quality of our time together quickly deteriorated.  I could not do anything right in his eyes.  He would pick fights with me daily (over the dumbest crap) and my life was miserable.  He began to treat me like he hated me, but only when we were at home and when nobody was looking.    One evening, after he berated me, he said he needed to finish some work in his office, and then he was going to visit his "parents" (without me), I decided to see if he was really were  he said he was going to be.  After that fight,  I asked God if this was really what he had in mind for me for a husband.  I begged God to give me a definitive sign of whether this man was trustworthy or not.   Then for the first time in our short marriage, I got in my car and decided to check to see if he was where he said he would be.  I had always taken his word.  My stomach was tied in knots.  It was late in the day, my bestfriend kept me company on the phone as I drove to see if his car was were it should have been.    Of course, it was not.   I went home feeling numb but knowing in my heart that I did not need to see anything with my own eyes.   I simply needed to just reflect on our lives together.  I  asked myself if I wanted to wake up ten years from that night, married to that lying, cruel, SOB.    I also thought, do I want my potential children to see me being treated like trash.  I knew that it would not get better.  It was steadily getting worse.  I was a good catholic girl and I did not want to divorce him, but the next morning around 8am, he went jogging with his buddy.   I got up, packed what was important to me and left.   He told me things like..."you will never find anyone as good, successful, etc as me"  He told me that I would probably live with my parents forever, and never leave the town I had grown up in.  The interesting thing is that  the day I left, I felt WONDERFUL!   I did not realize  just how  stressed, unhappy, and emotionally beaten down that I was.    I began to enjoy my life again.  I would go rollerblading with my headphones, spend time with my single peers, and live according to my rules.   In two weeks time, I had found a great, cozy apartment, and a line of nice guys who wanted to get to know me.   I took it slow, took care of myself and then met this extremely handsome med intern who was crazy about me.  After a 3 years of dating/shacking up [shame on me], we got married.  It is now 7 years later, and we are expecting our 3 baby.  We lived in Boston, NY, DC and now in the midwest.   He comes home after work and does not mind telling me where he is or has been on the few times that I ask.   The kids and I are his top priority, and they are mine.   Just as it should be.  I am soooo glad that I walked out the door.  I  did not wait around for hard evidence to make me leave him.  I knew in my gut that I deserved better, and that he was sh*t.   Now,  I am with someone that I don't have to wonder about.   I refused to settle for a crappy life with a true ---hole.   <br>  Hope my story helps.   One more thing,  he did not fight very hard to get me back.  It was a painful confirmation that he did not really care about me.  I think his cruelty was his way of pushing me away without coming right out to say..."I don't love you and no longer want to be married."   His actions said it all.  <br>  Good luck...and just ask yourself if you want to wake up ten years from now next to someone who treats you the way only you know he does.|`|KOjVWXOCaa	You should go up to his job to visit him and watch the way he treat you when you are there, and watch how many looks you get from other women. If he is talking about a woman going on and on about her; that is suspecious talk. I would be very careful and play investigator or put him on the show cheaters. I know you want to trust him, but sometimes love makes you blind to the obvious.|`|itxWU5HOaa	I would say ask him.<br>  Then keep better tabs on him..<br>  one way is to be with him when he gets his check and watch what he does with the check stubs, then confiscate one and check the hrs worked+overtime (if any).<br>  <br>  Then keep track of the days and hrs he says he "working" and see if they match up on the check stub for that week.<br>  <br>  Its the most easiest way to tell.|`|7d3edabfdc27c4ba2c6cd571f70d965daa	You have to, have to confront him about it.  A lot of times guys think you're oblivious to what they're doing and they'll KEEP doing it.<br>  <br>  I understand you've hinted around the point, but you need to come right out and ask him.  If he loves you, he should understand that you're worried.|`|LMITClMnaa	well . .it kinda seems like he is. u should ask him more questions & u gotta think things through so that they'll more sense or he's makin sense & if u ask him more questions dont ask to many or he'll think that ur on to him.|`|iSXzXfqraa	I don't know if he's cheating or not, but that sounds sketchy.  Does he answer his phone after work?  The perfume thing would really get to me though...that's a weak excuse.  I agree with post before me, why WOULD his coworker have perfume??|`|yI5ldlc1aa	I'm sorry honey. he probably is cheating. Damn, Why do people cheat! I just love my ex way to much to ever put her through that ****.|`|v8lSuNQzaa	You know he is...you don't need us to say so.|`|ckr2be5daa	I would not tell him I was suspicious (easier to get evidence on him if you do it covertly).<br>  <br>  As previous poster said, smell his underwear.  Here's an idea....when he gets home after a suspicious outing, try to unzip his pants and act as if you want to give him a BJ.  If his dick smells like another woman's...... you'll know!!!<br>  <br>  Try to do the recon work very discreetly though....in the long run, it will be better as he'll start trying to hide more if you tell him you suspect.<br>  <br>  You can always ask co-workers indirectly (ie how was that mtg you all had at work on Saturday?)<br>  <br>  Good luck!  Saying a prayer for you.  You'll make it through either way!<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  <br>  A couple of other thoughts---<br>  <br>  I agree with the poster who said to check his clothes nightly for hairs that don't match your own.  Also agree on checking the car for evidence of anything on any "suspicious activity" day...at some point, he'll slip up.<br>  <br>  Lastly, loved the idea about going into work unannounced.  You could even bring brownies for the entire team of people he works with.   I would think that you would quickly be able to size up if other peope know and you may even be able to pick out who it is.  You can say "I thought I would surprise you and we can go out to dinner".<br>  <br>  Please keep us posted! Thinking of you!|`|OHfZFR31aa	He is showing the classic signs of cheating - changing his work schedule, smelling of perfume, not paying attention to you, etc<br>  <br>  I would hire a private investigator to see if he really is working late or working on Saturdays.|`|XqS5DxR9aa	Uh oh.|`|elhcuN19aa	Lol<br>  he was getting it in at work with a woman.....<br>  How sad that people use excuses all of the time men/women to cheat.....<br>  <br>  edit<br>  I had an exgf toss a few "smooth lies" to me also<br>  and she cheated...<br>  I dumped her.....<br>  or maybe I was her "next move" who knows but I killed the relationship. She lied too much for me|`|M43M4KZxaa	why would an office mate bring his wife's perfume in the first place? maybe he has the Habit of bringing it,in case he wants to play joke at someone?i don't think a husband will do it.so probably he is lying.|`|36PrVK7Oaa	Yes. He is cheating. You need to hire a high school guy to help you around the house since he is never thare.|`|naequcqlaa	Why would a husband be carrying around his wife's perfume in the first place?!  That's too odd to even be true.  Something just does NOT "ring true" in what he's telling you for whatever reason.  The next time he comes home late, I'd be honest w/him & tell him you're sorry, but you're having a hard time understanding why all of a sudden he's coming home later than he normally did.  Put it back on him, & ask him IF this was happening on your end of things, wouldn't he question it just like you are?  Then too, ask him why in the world did this husband have his wife's person w/him?  Most men do NOT carry around their wife's perfume, none that I ever knew did.  I'd out rite tell him you ARE concerned about all these "new" things he's doing, & he certainly cannot blame you for wondering.  Tell him you need HIS help in helping you to be able to over come them.  You just are having too many problems being able to understand & overcome them.  Also, you must know where he works, you could always do a "drive by" & see IF his car IS at work as he says he's at work.  I don't know if you're "allowed" to go in his place of business, BUT you could say you were in the area & tho't you'd just stop by to say hi & that you might be a bit late coming home, so just stopped by to let him know.  Maybe you just can get to the bottom of things if you give it some tho't.  Good luck to you tho...:)|`|ycNxVrUfaa	I've found that trusting your gut is usually the right thing to do. Personally, there's an awful lot of "fishy" sounding circumstances but that doesn't mean he's cheating for sure. I'm pretty sure if my husband came home smelling of another woman's perfume, he'd find himself out of my life.|`|MjSLQlIHaa	yes darling but sorry he's a lying sneaky dog like the rest of them. pay him back you go out and get you a piece u know what i mean, and then go tell him you met a nice guy who made you come insanely lol!|`|8747ad5946dec06c50e2f01268404c87aa	i agree with the person that said: smell his under ware. <br>  Have you seem any hair on his clothing that isn't his or yours?<br>  Check under the seat of his car for condom wrappers.|`|UUrqECXIaa	It takes him 2-3 hours to get home every day? You deserve a better explanation than "around".  Why would his co-worker have his wife's perfume at work?? I would be suspicious.|`|LbipT3yIaa	talk to him and see whats up if he keeps on lying to you then ask his co-workers if anything weird has been going on with your husband and the girl|`|5mTKspfYaa	absolutely he is|`|LNSiLxlBaa	Sorry. He's cheating more than likely.|`|PZStgtdKaa	If you smell his under-ware you will know.
da3764770f9d97db5463f7e509eac31caa	I've been reading your ongoing questions for weeks and I'm so sorry for the situation that you're in.  If this is only happening on the weekends, which hopefully will get resolved soon after his appointment on Monday with some kind of new meds, .... anyway, if this is only a problem on the weekends, then you need to go to your Mom's for your own safety and emotional welfare.  Honestly.  I went through something similar with my husband with an experimental medication he was on.  I stayed with him because I knew it was only a temporary situation .... He only had to be on it for a year or two but he was acting close to what you're describing.  He was a completely, totally different person than the one I married and he hated everyone and everything and he was vicious and violent and hateful.  The only reason I stayed was because I knew it was a temporary situation and I knew it wasn't him.... it was the medication making him act that way but it was so hard to go through.  Like I said though, at least I had a light at the end of the tunnel and knew mine was ending.... you don't have that to look forward to so it's that much harder for you.<br>  <br>  Hopefully, you'll get some answers on Monday that will help you some.  But if you need to stay away on the weekends, please don't feel bad and don't feel guilty.  You need to do what you have to in order to protect yourself and keep yourself healthy.  That doesn't mean you love him any less or that you're not taking care of him.  You've hung in there a lot longer I think than most people would and you deserve a lot of credit for that.  Good luck to you.  I hope things get better for you and I hope you get some answers!|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	We cannot "fix" other people. And your husband sounds like he could be diagnosed as Bipolar, Manic-Depressive, or Manipulative.<br>  <br>  Whatever his condition is, it is neither normal...nor healthy to live with. He should get professional help ASAP. Hopefully he will.<br>  <br>  I would suggest you google information on these conditions so you can see where he fits in. I also think you are entitled to feeling the way you do, and also to consider leaving him. <br>  <br>  Abuse is never right...and life is too short to waste it on someone who doesn't love or respect us! Good luck.|`|FewhKlx9aa	The fact that you don't want to go to moms may be your only choice for right now.It scares me that maybe he may get so angry that he will pick something up and hit you or worse kill you.Something happened and that has to be addressed by a physical first to exclude tumors or some other medical problem.Once the doc finds nothing physically wrong then the therapist.Does he work? How does he get along with other people or is it just you? Why just on the weekends? there seems to am underlying cause here if he is fine on the weekdays.|`|SovaFpN8aa	Hang out with a friend (female) for the weekend.|`|djUMvICoaa	So how much exercise does this guy get?  I have seen so many people that expect their body to function properly while they don't even give it the minimum amount of exercise.  Without proper exercise things start to slow down, back up and then with aches and pains galore it starts to affect the head.  If he hasn't been this way before and he has been doing minimum amount of exercise I think this could be his problem.|`|unVj43Xxaa	It's better you stay away till the appt so you don't get hurt. Abuse now matter how it comes about is usually there to stay. I personally have never seen where counseling seems to help guys that are abusive. You're playing with fire even though you're trying to be supportive. Less damage will be done if you stay away until a mental exam can be done.|`|ycNxVrUfaa	He's right to see a psychiatrist. You should suggest a medical dr. too. My friend's sister started behaving much the same way and ultimately they found out she had a brain tumor.<br>  You didn't mention how long you've know him or how long you've been married. If it's been a short time perhaps he was good at hiding his rage. I think it's interesting that it happens only on the week-ends. Odd.|`|20ee7f2aadb248558085cabc8d4743ccaa	You need to spend time away from him until you know what his problem is. I think you Mom would rather have you at her house then be in a house where you could be hurt. Good luck,<br>  M|`|W7uP1ty4aa	Is your husband on steroids?|`|AA11956029	next time u making out tell him wat u want him 2 do ....|`|F21oSyQFaa	You are correct, no one has the "vaguest" clue what the heck you're talking about, because you didn't mention ANYTHING about being thrown from a car and beaten in your original question.  You added that part after people responded.  <br>  <br>  Your question was, simply put:  "I want to leave my husband because I'm fed up with his mental illness"  then you mentioned he had a brain tumor and that you were "concerned that he was going to hit you".  This outright implies that he had never hit you before.  The abuse you mentioned was apparently verbal, and not terribly surprising from a brain cancer and mental patients.  As I mentioned in my previous response, "Protect yourself from physical abuse."<br>  <br>  Read your original question for yourself, and stop being pissed at me because you changed the story.  I'm sorry about your past, it sounds terrible in ways I can't possibly understand, but don't expect perfect strangers to read your mind and know details of your life that you don't mention in your question.  If you want to change it or add to it, so be it.  But don't get pissed at me for answering based on your original question.  I cannot be held responsible for your exclusion of relevant details.  <br>  <br>  There's nothing funny about abuse, whether it be against women or men.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	You need to get over to your mom's NOW and worry about being embarrassed later, he is dangerous until he gets help and every hour you spend with him is risky.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Go to your mom's. Don't let your pride get in your way. If he's losing it as you suggest, you need to keep yourself safe. Deal with Monday on Monday.<br>  <br>  I 'm curious about this happening on weekends only? What is he like through the week? What does he do and where does he go? Where are you through the week?
VPFXlKWraa	ya that's not only mean but selfish and self centered she obviously had a total disregard for your feelings and that is SO not cool.You don't need her any way find someone into you more then them self's and a shallow perjection of what they think they want.Who does she think she is anyways. has she already found some body else? Maybe she is describing her new mate.But no worries when she changes her mind about what her type is again that tall, southern Gentleman, that is athletic will be tossed ashore to unless he is smart and sees her for what she is first.best of luck|`|2a8cc9318c96f41c1aa7cf5042dd932aaa	that's real shallow, i guess she just realized u were too good for her.

pEZr6MBHaa	It sounds like he was ignoring you anyway, so what was there to let go?  If he's ignoring you, then I wouldn't try to hard to keep the friendship alive.  It can't be one sided.  As long as you're not super-bothered by it (which it doesn't sound like you are, since you came up with the "moving on" plan on your own,) then I would do just that.  Move on.|`|hpHaofpnaa	I would say what your doing is right. I think he's stopped being friends with you. Just always be cool to him and don't hate on him/her behind their back.

I've never been in love, but they say when you are you'll know it! Maybe until that moment you don't really know.

86PFQF4raa	Yes,darling,we have already found true love,I love you more,than every grain of sand,on all the beaches of the world.You mean more to me than life itself.You are the answer to all my dreams,and so much more.I will cherish you with all my heart.|`|2DKu5WzNaa	normally when your not looking for it|`|1GNEFdwhaa	Well to find true love, it would take time.<br>  First you need to know that both you and your partner have trust in each other. Of course you can love each other for looks but most importantly its about whats in the inside. The personality of that person. You need to know that the person loves you for who you are not for how you look and that your not just dating them for sex, true love is about trust & honesty.<br>  <br>  -Hope i helped :)|`|AA11043457	Sometimes it finds  you especially when you stop looking too hard for it.<br>  <br>  Sometimes you know someone a long time and you feel a bit of attraction.  I think true love comes after time. It comes from serving the other one and being committed.  Might have a lot of lust and attraction and care, but true love has to endure time. I was married 25 years and thought we had true love, but not the last 5 or 10 years. I thought we had it straightened out at 15 yrs and then it happened again. He was unfaithful, so I figure that is not true love or not on his part.  I loved him.  It was devastating to have  him not love me anymore.  I wouldn't trust him now, but there is still some affection.  I've been married now 17 years.I'd have been close to 50 years had we not divorced.  Now my husband and I have a goal to pass that 25 years.  We already passed both his marriages together.|`|5YI6rBdOaa	You dont. it finds you.|`|8nTedv6kaa	Well this is how I did it:<br>  I arrived in high school and a girl started hanging out with my group of friends.  I found her extremely annoying and we developed a healthy feud that continued for a while.  Then we both joined a choir and we kind of talked a bit because we knew each other.  We still didn't like each other though.  Then over time we started playing games online such as our favorite, backgammon.  At that point we probably didn't hate each other anymore, but we most likely wouldn't consider the other a good friend.  During junior year, our choir went on a trip and we stayed at a hotel with a pool.  We spent our whole night playing together in the pool and going down the slides and such.  That was the point where we really realized that we had fun together.  Also during junior year, our separate relationships ended and we talked a lot and basically became best friends.  That summer we went to Brewers games, State Fair, Summerfest, and a whole bunch of other stuff, but we were just friends.  At the end of that summer, we finally gave in and admitted that we liked each other, so we started dating.  2 years or so later, we're still going strong.  You see, our round-about process of hating each other, becoming truly best friends, and then starting to date created a crazy foundation for our relationship.  We weren''t looking for each other, we just lived our lives and they ended up revolving around each other.  So basically, if you want true love, find the guy or girl that you can be best friends with.  Find the one that you can truly be yourself with and not have to worry about what they think.  Then, everything should fall into place.
86PFQF4raa	Yes,i will cherish this precious moment until i die.You make me so happy darling.I love every beautiful day with you,Fantastic you by my side.I love you so much sweetheart.|`|2DHnQZ4xaa	Yes, along with the birth of your children|`|237f7b8deabaa8cf367ed76288106f19aa	isn't that the point? Are you obsessed with getting proposed to or are you engaged?
86PFQF4raa	Yes,you are the special person,in the world,babe,and you are so beautiful,and cute darling,I love you so much sweetheart,and i want to spend the rest of my life with you,too.I love you angel face.|`|5TLGa3awaa	Yes, I finally have.  I'm 37 and never really saw myself getting married because of all the games people play these days.  That and I always went for the bad boys.  I finally grew a brain and found the most wonderful man ever.  I thank God for him everyday.|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	Yes. We were married in October.|`|94464c65a3cf331abd994f1207860d7eaa	I'm more in love then I ever thought was possible <3|`|8g51eBf1aa	Nope, still looking. But I'm trying to focus on me right now, the right guy will come around eventually. Especially when I'm not expecting it. :)|`|TJrRPIFLaa	Yep.  It took me almost 19 years to find him, and I married him about 17 months after I met him.  I am happy and proud to say that I will be spending most of my life with him.|`|fe8aa5495caab3873690c07d37e65268aa	Yes, I finally have and I am 41 and getting married in May!  I thank God for sending him to me.|`|JIjuNh9Maa	yes. the first night i met him i knew it was right. we're just dating right now, but i know hes the one|`|7pYyXSBUaa	Yes I have!<br>  Been together 6 yrs we have our second child on the way<br>  and our wedding is set for March 2010!|`|5voteJLRaa	Yes and it feels good! I hope that we will soon be engaged..I'm keeping my fingers crossed!|`|4POGapREaa	Yep.  Took a while.  I just got married & I'm 37.  Had to filter out all the losers & get over my pretty boy rock star phase before waking up to reality & meeting someone who's actually worth my time.|`|nqINitkmaa	Yes, we are getting married 8/21/09
86PFQF4raa	When two people fall in love like we have.I know when to say "I Love You" its the most natural impulse to follow.I feel your wonderful love everyday.You make me feel so special and happy.TY sweetheart for being you.I love you more than the stars and moon.|`|NBTuFkCFaa	Most of the time, it just comes out of nowhere. You don't force yourself to say it, you just say it.|`|2DKu5WzNaa	when you honestly feel like you do|`|to6JW3yFaa	When you really feel it.<br>  <br>  BUT at the same time it really shouldnt be too early because you might end up freaking the other person out if they dont fully feel the same way. If it's early in a relationship (less than 6 months)... I advise you to not say it. But that's just me. I would wait until I had a feeling that the other person felt the same way about me.
86PFQF4raa	I would love to tie the knot with you sweetheart.we could get a tattoo babe.Engrave our names on passing trees.I could get a helicopter to cross the sky with a trailing banner.with the words,"I Love You".I will send you dozens of red roses.I love you so much my lovely cutie pie.|`|Oz5F8Alfaa	Te amo|`|c2lsxMtfaa	It sounds simple, but add their name on the end. "I love you James." or whatever. It makes it seem so much more serious. And slightly personalized.<br>  <br>  Do you have a song? As a couple? Me and my boyfriend do, and there's a line in there that says "I will love you until my dying day." So it may seem cheesy, but when he says "I will love you until my dying day," it shows his feeling and is personalized. Try and do something the same.|`|ViK719Gkaa	I can say that when my girlfriend swallows it makes me realize she really does love me. <br>  <br>  And yes it works both ways.|`|juJc98lRaa	Tattoo it on your forehead.
86PFQF4raa	My love for you is based on true emotions,and real truth.I would never lie to you.I respect,and admire you,with all my true feelings of love,I want to make you feel so happy.Just like you make me feel happy too.I will always worship the ground you walk upon.|`|TJiGs8S4aa	You've raised a complex question without many particulars for us to see what might have prompted this question.  Fact is, sometimes we don't know what our "true feelings" really are.  Often times we think we care about someone, when that person may really just be making our insecurities feel better - so our "feelings" about them are really more about ourselves than they are about them.  Other times we think we know a person, based on what we see and what they've shown us - only to discover later that they have been misrepresenting themselves, and all we've been seeing is a lie and an elaborate facade.  Our ability to know the truth is limited.
FoWDGLyIaa	You are more mature, and adults don't judge as much. They have wisdom, and are there for you as much as friends are, but can be more helpful in situations your friend has no experience in. Adults can understand more, simply because they have gone through most of the things you go through and can help.|`|7YTiooX5aa	Probably because you are more mature. My 17 yr old daughter has more older friends then her own age and that is because she was always around people older then her. There isn't anything wrong with it other then you can go out with your older friends since most of them are adults and go out to bars and adult things . hang in there everything will be fine and eventually you will have a crowd of friends in your age group.|`|O0JODS6naa	yeah i say cuase you are more mature if people your age we're more mature you would get way more friends your age.
RKQHRMusaa	urm i would see that as okay but maybe thats because thats where i live and the environment around me. but like if shes happy really you should be happy but if you not, then your not.. and if shes ready then why not?
08a1322a8b7849e448d2bb758fb41239aa	Have you tried filing a report? Also write down their badge numbers and go file the report that way? Maybe he's in jail the hospital, Prison, his parents. They can't keep harrassing you like that, maybe you should start taking pics of the stuff and maybe take to a lawyer. Good luck.|`|AfnQ95Z5aa	Call a lawyer.  Most areas in the western world have free legal consultations.  Call a lawyer's office and ask for one.  If that doesn't work, call your local law society.<br>  <br>  You have to remember something:  The police aren't there to help you in this situation.  Only a lawyer will help you.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	If it is the city police, go down to their headquarters and ask to speak to the chief of police or file a formal written complaint if you cannot see him or her immediately.<br>  <br>  If it is the county sheriff, do the same with the sheriff.<br>  <br>  To a certain extent, they do this because it works in many cases (too many cases) and the public at large doesn't overly care, because it is our money providing the largesse that so many are abusing.  <br>  <br>  But there are rights that you have and you need to assert them.  Good luck.|`|E7RhMRKhaa	You need an attorney a.s.a.p.|`|7z9eKO2maa	this is serious, you should go to the police station and deal with it there, that way they can't hurt your kids or won't be breaking down any doors, help them in every way you feel you can, next time the father calls open another line and call the police so they can track him using that, that's the only way they'll leave you alone... i hope it works out.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Go to the police station and explain to them that you have not seen your husband for more than 6 months and have no idea where he is. Give them any addresses you think he might be living - his parents, a long time friends, etc. Tell the police that they are welcome to stop by anytime you are home and you will show them around the place so they can see he is not living there|`|Whd6tqLzaa	I think you should see a lawyer. If you are divorced from your kid's father, then show them the document. If not get in the process of divorcing him, file for a divorce and keep the paper handy. That man should not get you into trouble by using your address.

cirdAuVfaa	well you could do multiple thingss..<br>  <br>  1. tell her and tell her to not tell the boy.<br>  <br>  2.not tell her and act like everythings ok<br>  <br>  3. not tell her and say when he does break up with her  that you knew but you just couldnt tell herr<br>  <br>  4.ask the boy about it and maybe he will allow you to tell her or something<br>  <br>  <br>  idk this ones hard. i hope i helped|`|XxQVSzGiaa	He shouldn't have told you ge was gonna break up with your best friend. If he didn't know it was going to make things awkward, he's an idiot. I suggest to simply stay out of that part of the relationship trouble, and only offer your best friend a shoulder to cry on.
fBXRNKyuaa	I would stay out of it, if your girl friend asks if you knew about it just say that you her and her ex are both your friends and you have to keep both of their secrets to YOURSELF.<br>  <br>  Does that make sense?|`|NVg06Egwaa	I swear, I'm like in your exact position RIGHT NOW! <br>  <br>  It's a terrible place to be, because it seems like you can never choose one right side!!<br>  <br>  I've learned that I need to just STAY OUT OF IT. Being inside of it, will only make them both lose your trust without you even doing anything.  It's like walking on broken glass (SOS!).  Sorry, I do have OJD.<br>  <br>  Anyways, Tell him that he needs to go and confront her about it. he HAS to. They need to work out their problems together, not with you in the middle of it. <br>  <br>  If they coudl start the relationship, and love eachother enough for it, they need to work out their problems together.|`|M8jxBSJaaa	well you gotta decide who you care most about. honestly, your girl friends will always be there for you. and right now your not being there for your  girlfriend. back away from this guy, but not totally. you dont want to give him the wrong message. and talk to your friend about other guys. try to get her intrested in someone else. <br>  just make sure you dont jump from side to side.. cuz thats kinda two faced.|`|EKDnnFupaa	SIDE WITH TEH ONE YOU WANTS TO SLEP WIT TEH MOSTEST<br>  IF ITS HIM THAN DONT TEL<br>  IF ITS HER THAN POST PICS<br>  THEY SEE ME GIVIN INFORMATTTTTTION AN THEY HATIN CUZ IM SO EXCELLANT THAT IM A GENIOS WORD
8cf66894663c74e69b5ed17db7228d97aa	Why don't you just love him and wait for him to get back. If he loves you the time will only make it more so and he'll probably want to get engaged or married.|`|AA11676888	Don't look for signals and signs. You need to ask. Communication in a relationship is everything. If you are afraid to talk to your boyfriend, then there is a problem.|`|8ZPchcEgaa	Actions may mean more than words but their also harder to decipher. Just be upfront with him and ask him. And get used to not seeing him often as long as he's in the army.|`|BOzeeAN2aa	I think if he sees how you've been there for him throughout his deployment he'll see how much you love him. When he gets back hopefully he can show you how much it meant to him.|`|rzPIO1aQaa	girl you knew when you got with him that he was in the army if you couldn't handle it you shouldn't have got in that position. I couldn't be with an army guy they are away to much and specially right now because of the war. Just support him and when he comes home talk to him about what you want and see if he wants the same things. My fiance worked in construction and I was at home by myself taking care of the kids all the time it sucked really bad this was for about 4 months and I never want that to happen again so for all the women who deal with this I give them props because it takes a strong woman to be alone for as long as she does. ( Thanks to your guy for serving our country). Just smile and wait for your man to come home and be in your arms and you can talk about all of it when he gets back.|`|AA11791155	You can't tell unless you two spend time together. Go on a vacation. Make it at least 14 days long. See how you get along. If you are fighting by the end.....move on|`|RtkB46peaa	Sounds WAY to early for marriage.  A talk is probably called for, though.
AA11647373	Here's my motto-<br>  Everything is about balance. If you have the right balance, things will go great. But if you have the wrong balance, everything will be wrong.<br>  I think there are ways to have a girlfriend and still hang out with your friends.<br>  but you can think about it this way, will these friends be in your life forever? Will this girl possibly be in your life forever? Depending on your answers, you should prioritize who you think is most important.<br>  And guess what? you really could have missed out on a chance at an amazing 'forever' love. You probably won't ever know.<br>  The good thing about mistakes is this- you learn from them, and you won't make the same ones again.<br>  There are other girls out there.<br>  Best of luck to you on your journey!|`|D5AepfDkaa	My opinion you are really stupid and if the girl dosen't have anyone now I would try to get her back|`|xNMPvgFhaa	Like you said, you were young and naive.<br>  There's nothing you can do now. Move on and next time if you got into the same situation, assess it and try to manage your time better so both your friends and gf won't feel neglected.|`|GqI8wY8Iaa	So!!! You would rather make out with your friends is what your saying.
7YQQK1e7aa	okay if she's loose like u say she is then she probably got something  <br>  if i were u wouldn't cause she is looking for people to accept her and thats the only way she knows how to get it  so just be her firend and show  her that ur not like everyone else then maybe later down the line u can have sex but somethin tells me u already has sex once but now u don't feel right about it|`|4HoVVCenaa	You shouldn't because, as you suspect, you will damage her, and that will then make you feel bad. Why not be more like a brother and support and help and befriend her. Help her clean up her act a bit.|`|YWZYVZSTaa	dude you are master,im 19 and i didn't have sex till now.i think you should know her more and it will help you to understand her.then you can find this answer by yourself...but i prefer to dont have sex with her now..you should  wait...Good Luck
f8ON3dRfaa	Did you let her know that you're giving her space not because you don't love her but because she needs to sort out her thinking first?<br>  <br>  Rejection to any girl will imply that feelings have been lost or "you don't love her anymore".<br>  <br>  Just assure her that you're still madly in love with her, assure her that while she sets herself right, you're not dating other girls and will be waiting for her when she's ready. <br>  <br>  She needs a lot of reassurance and be sure to give her the emotional support she needs.<br>  <br>  I think it's mature of you to make such a decision.

There are 500 million women in this world and you can't manage to find your own piece of the pie without betraying your relative whom trust and cares about you. What a looser you are.

If he's as laid back as you make him out to be then I don't see why it would bother him honestly, unless he'd be grossed out by it. You know him best.
otTMXJvRaa	Hi S.B.,<br>  <br>  I’m going to assume that you're about 14 or 15 and in High School.<br>  <br>  The way to find out if a guy loves you?  If you have to ask him... then he probably doesn't love you.  Most guys will proclaim their love for you if you treat him properly over the long haul.  <br>  <br>  It takes about a year of dating to get to know a person well enough if they'll make a good spouse.  You sound a bit young to be seriously dating just yet.<br>  <br>  The best way to FIND a guy who will love you is to be a decent young lady, and expect all of the guys you date to treat you with dignity and respect.<br>  <br>  Anything less… such as acting like a sl*t, or having sex outside of marriage… will typically make your life much more difficult.  Creeps and players are attracted to sl*ts, and those types of guys don’t make good husbands.  Creeps and players also target innocent young ladies who are not sluts, because the naive girls might believe their smooth lines of crap...so you need to keep your guard up. <br>  <br>  By refusing to participate in premarital sex, you'll find out pretty quickly if the guy you are dating just wants to get into your pants… or if he truly respects you, your body, your heart, your soul, your feelings, your values… and your family. <br>  <br>  The biggest hazard out there for young ladies is in the BF arena. Perhaps a general crash course all about guys, BF's, crushes, dating, love, etc. would be helpful for you to think about.<br>  <br>  S.B.... crushes, dating, and love can be confusing... extremely confusing... for adults as well as young people. That's why it is a good idea not to start dating too early.<br>  <br>  It would be advisable for young ladies to not start seriously dating until about age 16 or 17. Your parents should say OK and meet the guy first. And stay a virgin (i.e., no premarital sex) until you get married. The decisions that you're making now will have a large effect on how the rest of your life will turn out.<br>  <br>  In High School, young guys and young girls can be pretty unpredictable, and change their minds very quickly... for no reason whatsoever. That can lead to hurt feelings and heartache. You and some guy might both agree that you like each other one day, and literally the next day either one of you could call it quits. Just remember that.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that the purpose of dating is generally to determine if a person will make a potentially good future spouse. Therefore, don't ever date someone that you know would not be good for you in the long term.<br>  <br>  Don't assume that you will marry your first crush or your first serious BF... it won't happen. The odds are literally 100-to-1 against it. Sorry! <br>  <br>  As a decent and trusting young lady, you will need to be aware of a few of the potential hazards of dating. These hazards certainly apply to young people as well as adults. That's also why you need to not start kissing or making out too early with guys (even though you might want to).<br>  <br>  S.B., here are two major dating hazards for you to consider:<br>  <br>  1. There are some guys out there (the smooth players) who will tell a nice girl that he loves her, just to see how far she will let him go with her body. There are guys out there who are ready and willing to use you and your body for their own selfish pleasure... and then leave... breaking your heart in the process, and possibly leaving you pregnant... or with an STD (a nasty disease in your private parts). Hopefully, you will be mature enough when dating to recognize these losers, and say "No".<br>  <br>  2. You could meet a genuinely nice and decent guy, and you both really do think that you love each other. After a few weeks or months, you both might be tempted to take off your clothes together. That would be a good way to mess up both of your young lives. It's happened to a lot of nice girls and decent guys out there. Hopefully, you will be mature enough to resist this type of temptation... and the temptation can be very strong.<br>  <br>  The best way to avoid getting into trouble from either hazard listed above is for you to never be alone with your guy... anywhere. Not his house, not your house, not a friend's house, or anywhere else. A responsible (and awake) adult should always be nearby.<br>  <br>  You should also never attend a party where no adults are present... ever. Nor any events with drugs or alcohol abuse.<br>  <br>  Ideally, before you start dating, you need to make a conscious decision to remain a virgin until you are happily married. That means no premarital sex. Having sex too early will make you feel sad, cheap, and make it less special (same thing with kissing in case you do it too early with the wrong guy... but kissing is much less dangerous).<br>  <br>  OK, why no premarital sex? <br>  <br>  Because having sex without marriage is going outside of the laws of man and God that civilizations on this planet have lived by for thousands of years.<br>  <br>  Because there's the unnecessary risk of excessive heartache (any break-up will cause heartache... virgin or not... but heartache will be less if you are still a virgin... that's just the way human brains are wired).<br>  <br>  Because there's also the genuine danger of an unwanted Baby... or an STD.<br>  <br>  Because your parents would very likely be extremely disappointed.<br>  <br>  Because your "no sex" rule will pretty much eliminate the players, the losers, the creeps, the clods, and the selfish manipulators. <br>  <br>  S.B., just take a look at a random selection of the questions from girls in this category... a significant number of problems here directly involve premarital sex... coupled with immaturity, foolish expectations, and invalid assumptions.<br>  <br>  You need to date nice guys who will treat you with dignity and respect while you are having innocent fun together during your youth. Trustworthy guys who would not ask you to do anything inappropriate.<br>  <br>  Long term, you need to find a special guy who will be honorable and be very good to you as you grow into a decent young woman. He may not be the hottest-looking guy around, but you will love him just the way he is. He should be a guy who is proud to take you home to meet his parents and his family. A guy that you would be pleased to take home to be introduced to your parents and family. A guy who will ask for your hand in marriage. A guy who is willing to stand together with you in a wedding ceremony before both of your families in church.<br>  <br>  You don't want a guy who is not honorable and just wants your body... for a while... and then he would be gone. A problem like that is much more likely to happen if you give away your body without the commitment of marriage.<br>  <br>  Keep yourself out of trouble by thinking smart. Don't believe everything a guy tells you... watch him carefully, and evaluate whether or not his words are consistent with his actions. See if he respects you and your values.<br>  <br>  Don't be afraid or embarrassed to talk to your parents or your family about dating and boy issues as you are growing up. They know you, love you, and will certainly give you good advice.<br>  <br>  Meeting guys you don't know via the internet is a bad idea. Stick with guys you know in real life.<br>  <br>  You will be really happy when you are older, and you look back over your life... happy that you made the right decisions about finding, dating, and evaluating guys when you were young.<br>  <br>  That's pretty much the big picture for you to look at, S.B..<br>  <br>  Someday, you'll make a lucky guy a fine wife.<br>  <br>  Take care, and God bless.<br>  <br>  Best wishes,<br>  - Charlie <br>  <br>  P.S. - Perhaps it would be a good idea for you to join sports teams at school. There will be less free time for you to dwell on BF and teen issues. Plus, you'll be in good shape, and you'll look cute in the competitive outfits at the games. Guys are absolutely fascinated by female athletes, and love seeing them in shorts and t-shirts... with minimal make-up... and they won't care if you are sweaty and your hair is a bit messed up. No kidding. You'll have more boys looking at you than you ever thought was possible. And your wardrobe costs??? Essentially zero! In addition, your Coach will be around to keep an eye on you and give good advice if you need it. <br>  <br>  Finally, you'll develop more self esteem, confidence, self control, better judgment, and you'll be much less likely to get into trouble. You'll be stronger mentally... and later when you start dating, the relationships that develop will be more stable. Guaranteed 100%.|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	Just ask him|`|FzFSzilmaa	ask him.. :D
mLabzxnIaa	dump that piece of trash|`|9Qx6UqsPaa	umm well apparently she is not gold digging..maybe she does has money problems...nd ur the one who insisted she keep playing the violin maybe the reason y she stopped playin the violin is because she didnt have one...nd u want her to keep playin so y not contribute.....the music is goin to b for u..nd luk she is poor...kk...|`|Ca7Xkjqxaa	Why do you need the internet to meet women? Go to a bar or do an activity or something. Dump that girl, she's a cheapo looking to scam you.|`|ablriuUVaa	i would date a few more times<br>  she might just had been nervous since it was the first time meeting<br>  <br>  but if she keeps hinting for gifhts or worse a loan  <br>  <br>  i would move on 4sure|`|8Ypkfr7jaa	You can't judge anyone on just the first date.<br>  And dude, not on match.com or eHarmony.... please|`|AA11356977	I never ask my guy to buy me things and we are going on 5 years! RUN she is lookin for a sugar daddy.|`|2bb1214a282e2cfeed0adeb41e0bcf6eaa	is that the only thing she mentioned about you buying her something? if that was the only thing then maybe let it go and see what happens if you do actually like her. she might not have meant it in the way you thought and you laughing made her a bit unconfortable or she might have even wished she hadnt said it.<br>  then again, she COULD have been hinting at you buying her stuff. the thing is youre not really going to know what she is really like from 1 date, so if you like her then give her a chance and you'll soon get to know what shes really like|`|jhNUuz0maa	I wouldn't based on that. She might have not able to afford a violin, and you mentioned it to her and since she couldn't buy one, she said you should. <br>  Go out on another date, and see if she hints at more gifts. She might not hint anymore, but if she does, call her out on it. What do you have to lose? You should ask her if that is all she is wanting, for you to buy her things. Explain to her that you will probably buy her gifts after a while into the relationship, but you don't feel the need for gifts at this point. You are wanting to learn who she is and you don't want to be liked for the gifts you give her. If she is ok with it, then she isn't a gold digger. If she doesn't want another date after that, then she probably was. You just need to make sure you pay for the dates, but keep the malls or stores out of any dates you have.|`|dxdvdgFiaa	Well. I do think that she should have been more reserved with this being a first date and all. She appears not to have much dating exerience as well. But that works to your advantage because you can realize from the get go what she is really all about. <br>  <br>  I would say that there is a high chance that yes she could be a gold digger.|`|lHfiz2xOaa	Wow  sorry this might not be the answer you want but usually if you feel that red flag go up... TRUST IT   Ive had similar stuff like that happen ...and I wish I wouldve listened to them.  The hinting.... thats a HUGE sign also    So I think you should get a restraining order jk|`|lVk3ZSnEaa	In my opinion, yes, move on.  You are out of her league but still buy her a violin so she'll have good memories of the kind Man you are.|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	please save yourself some money and the trouble and move on<br>  <br>  she is not girlfriend material, sounds like she just lot of attention and people to buy her stuff|`|evB63qWvaa	I would definitely say a gold digger.  I used to have a boyfriend like that and I dropped him faster than a toilet seat.  Be careful.|`|1jIzBUkhaa	dump her she is not thinking of a relationship , she just want someone to get her what she wants.|`|XphTDpR7aa	maybe you should give it another date and see how it goes, but I know if some girl told me that on our first date I would not be seein her again|`|geuQmqjWaa	defiitely need to move on....sounds like a gold digger to me!|`|igI5yX0vaa	Ain't got no time fo a broke #%$@&*|`|vHxauOyeaa	gold diggers are fine if you can control them... if you don't buy them anything, too expensive or get married then you shouldn't have an issue because it will resolve itself. Just don't get too attached until you get a better idea of her.|`|2afVnStxaa	If she spent the evening talking about her job and the low income as well as the roommate, as well as her money problems AND hinted at buying her gifts so soon into this, she may well be after a "sugar daddy" to help her out. Go out with her a few more times and find out if she continues this or even talks more of it. Normally someone would not discuss money issues on a first date. Good luck to you.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	It's odd she should even mention her financial circumstances so soon! i think you're right and you shouldn't see her anymore.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	Just date and get to know her maybe she was nervous. But after a few dates if you still feel the same go to the next profile.|`|851c6ba054fa621b9fc32855c092c444aa	No way, listen to your instinct.

I wouldn't cheat on him for anything.|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	I wish you would stop asking these retarded questions!  Are you really engaged and thinking about having a last "fling" before marriage?  Obviously, the answer is no.  <br>  Or are you just on here being a retard and taking up people's time?  This must be the 20th time you've asked this same question in different ways.  Shut up already!|`|4POGapREaa	I would turn it down.  What's the point of getting married if you're still lusting & wanting to screw someone else?  Eww.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	No way!  When you get married, it should be because you already love and care deeply about each other anyway.  If you really love somebody, why in the world would you go behind their back and do something that would be so hurtful to them?  If the love you have for the person isn't already enough to keep you from cheating, then it's really unlikely that simply knowing you've said the vows and signed a piece of paper would do it either.|`|SsfnitjXaa	Personally I wouldn't have a problem with just saying no. <br>  <br>  Any person that would give this a second thought should stop the wedding immediately. There is something drastically wrong.|`|HQsmRzPsaa	don't eff up your marriage. is that really how you want to start your life together?|`|237f7b8deabaa8cf367ed76288106f19aa	It's just as bad to cheat or "have a fling" when your engaged as it is when your married.

ycNxVrUfaa	You have every right to be pissed off. If you husband had ANY sack he would have told his jerk friend that he won't tolerate any rudeness or disrespect to you. Your husband is as bad as his friend for allowing it to continue.<br>  You sound like a kind step-daughter and I realize that was a very difficult thing for you to do. They're saving a place in heaven for people like you.|`|ULUpOqplaa	Look at your own words - refuses to answer the phone and ORDERS me to answer it.  He didn't marry a wife, he married a slave/mother.  chances are you pick up after him since he does not pick up anything himself.  He probably puts you down in public in front of other people.  You had to do all of the bit with your step dad since he was not about to do anything associated with it.  He wanted a slave not a wife.|`|LNSiLxlBaa	Ummm...no. That's not normal. If I came home visibly and obviously upset about something like that and my husband let some guy who he claims is a "friend" be an ****ole to me, then we'd have some SERIOUS talking to do. WTF? Maybe he and his friend are gay...|`|g6n3OnmSaa	Both of them are huge jerks.  Are you getting anything at all that you need emotionally from your husand?  A big, huge hug after that horrible day?  Him letting you cry for a little bit?  Something?  Anything?  And is he always like this?|`|M43M4KZxaa	reacting will only lead to your husband's teasing.if it annoys you,be nice to him(the friend). your husband might see your point regarding his friends behavior.|`|LklBuVAXaa	It appears you've already made up your mind and are now looking for someone to enable your decision.  Just leave the guy already.  Why look for "back up" on yahoo answers?<br>  <br>  Also, you seem like a psycho anyways.  I would side with my best friend instead of you anyways.<br>  <br>  And you're welcome for even having someone of my intellect even bother with this stupid question.  Your mind is already made up!  Time to be a woman and stop acting like a little spoiled child.  Leave the man if you don't want to be married.  Don't get other people involved in your life.  And don't use his friends as an excuse for wanting a divorce.<br>  <br>  And BTW...typical woman reaction.  When they refuse to see fault in themselves they project it on the men in their lives.  You can't stand up to his friend so you take it out on him.  Woman want to be protected but when they are its called being controlled right?  You want your husband to protect you from his friend but as soon as he does then you will say he is trying to control you.<br>  <br>  Its a no win situation.  You control all the cards.  Its your play and not his right now.  Either ante up or fold.  But don't try to bluff.  You're not very good at it.|`|SgGB9Ji7aa	I would say that your Hubby’s response is not of the norm and yet it’s not uncommon…….. however I think it is wrong.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is this: Since your hubby won’t answer the phone, the next time his friend calls…. just hang up. When he calls back and asks why you hung up you tell him, if he can’t treat you with respect….. you will not deal with him.<br>  This will inevitably cause a conflict with you husband….. to which you reiterate the same thing. He will eventually get it….. but not until you stand up for yourself.<br>  He has to man up and show some respect for you, but this will not happen until you respect yourself.|`|vbAu5SY3aa	In this situation it was wrong. There is always guilt associated with placing a loved one or family member into the care of someone else. Why don't you just hang up on your husbands friend when he does this. Also, why didn't the husband help with putting the father into a care facility? The husband is "suppose" to be the strong supportive one. <br>  That is pretty callous and sick to prey on ones emotional pain. That friend is a jerk.|`|GIRgXMSkaa	A man should stand up for his wife no matter what.  It is only normal for immature men.  A real man knows his woman comes first and she should always be protected.<br>  Stick his @$$ on the couch for a few nights and if he doesn't get the picture, I would consider things seriously,  If he doesn't stick up for you now, he definately won't when things get even tougher for you.|`|UUrqECXIaa	No, I don't think it is normal. If your husband knows that you are seriously hurt by his friend's comments to you, he should tell his friend to back off. Since your husband is not doing this, you do it. There was no reason for you to have to explain your actions or take insults from this idiot. He needs to be put in his place.|`|w82en5ecaa	Well yah. It is normal but just ignore him.

Some of your remarks show that you are verbally being abused from both of these men.I would not answer the phone if you know it is him calling.If you see this guy in person avoid him at all cost.If you can't tell him to go get a life and a few other choice words.You need to start sticking up for yourself before your husband.You need to show you have some confidence and self esteem as there is something definitly wrong with your husband that he would allow a friend to give you the third degree.Tell him you'll go get your step dad and drop him off on his front porch to take care .What an *** I'm sorry but don't put up with this.

Vb9TfowIaa	Your story sounds very similar to mine i a lot of aspects. maybe telling u mine will help understand your problems. I made friends with a guy a year older than me in our school drama club.  We got on well and I considered us to be close friends. Then in year 8, one of my other friends (who, it turned out, fancied the guy and was jealous of our friendship) started saying i fancied him and started making sneering comments, of course if it was just her it wouldn't have mattered but soon everyone in both of our years was making the same comments. Of course this made it difficult for us to be friends but i was happy to ignore it but sadly he wasn't. He stopped being friends with me and started to ignore me in pretty much the same way your friend did. Then the next time we did a play together he started talking to me again as if we had never stopped being friends. I decided to pretend that nothing had happened and continued being his friend. During that play he got himself a girlfriend (who is a very nice person and in know way could i hate her) but he started ignoring me again. he is still doing it. The worse thing though is that his mates started saying i was stalking him which i so wasn't and that he himself was making hurtful remarks such as 'she might pretend to be a saint but she is a **** from hell. i know because she can't keep her hands off of me' and 'i would **** her my self but shes too stuck up ' ( i have cleaned them up a lot)the funny thing though despite all of this i still miss him. im not even angry even though i don't know why he is doing this. it can't be just because of the comments that were said or the fact that he has a girlfriend and doesn't want anything to do with me. i don't no. i expect the reason that u and i miss these guys is because we developed a special bond for some reason. mine is probably because he was my first friend at senior school. we probably remember the good times together, how they seemed special to us, but as the friendship ended so suddenly it left us stranded and confused and most of all shocked. if a friendship ends naturally it doesn't have that same impact, u r used to it and even though u might miss them, the friendship was ended by both of u, not just one. <br>      of course, i have wondered if i loved or fancied the guy without realising it, making him seem more special to me. maybe it was the same for u and this is why we miss them so much because you always do if u have loved them, however much they have hurt u. <br>       one way i use to cope without him and to help my self stop caring about him is too think of all the horrible things about him and try to forget the good as the good often cloud our judgement. i also try harder to make other friends who i can rely on and they always help me forget him. thirdly and this may sound rather sad, but make an imaginary friend inside your head that u can talk to. its almost like having a diary to talk to but u can give them personalities. make this a perfect friend for yourself- looks, everything, this friend can help u fill the void that the guy has left for u. u can imagine conversations anything, mak them better than the ones u had in real life with the guy. perhaps u should also talk to this guy. he might not be ignoring u on purpose. in fact he might think u r ignoring him. maybe he might think u don't want to be his friend and to cope with losing u he is ignoring u. it might happen.<br>        sorry i told u my problems as well as answering your question but i hope it helps u with your problem. i hope every thing turns out ok with this guy. fingers crossed|`|718HjVbaaa	Honestly sweetie, he's not worth it. Even if he wanted to date you, even if he got a girlfriend, he didn't have to kick you to the curb because of it. You guys could have still stayed friends, it's okay to a have a female friend while you have a girlfriend. So, my point is, stop hurting over him. Consider all that he's done to you. I'm not saying that you should hate him, but repeat this to yourself; what's happened has happened, now I need to look ahead.<br>  I really hoped that helped.|`|oHO0XOQVaa	Truly, that's the worst. He didn't have to do that to you and it's really mean that he would. If really did respect you and enjoy you he would have remained friends with you. He would have continued to like you for qualities that he appreciated in you even if he got a girlfriend. He wasted your time with his fake friendship and you're allowing him to waste even more of your time now by brooding over him.|`|oB1WQJHgaa	get a boyfriend! :) that will take your mind off of him... hope i helped.

1k7LIZVWaa	You should have discussed this before you got married.  You can't do much about that.  You need to resolve this issue or it will break you apart.  Try to compromise as best you can until you have this resolved.|`|RtkB46peaa	"we should go for our dreams and live our lives before we have to take care of his parents when they're old and retired"  <br>  <br>  I completely agree.  However, it sounds like moving away to another city is YOUR dream, not "our" dream. <br>  <br>  "I don't feel that I need to sacrifice more of my dreams for HIS PARENTS" <br>  <br>  You're absolutely right. You shouldn't feel this is a sacrifice for "HIS PARENTS".  The sacrifice is for HIM.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't call you a beotch or anything, you just need to respect his wishes, just as he needs to respect yours.  It sounds like a compromise is in order.|`|aXYiOskmaa	i can understand both points here. i don't want to move far from my family either. there's only a few of us. but, i see how you would want to experience different people, places and things. i've felt that way as well. you're in a tough spot, to say the least. you say his folks are young. how young? fifties/sixties? and how far are you thinking of moving? new town? new state? perhaps if you're in the same state but say, 100 miles away, he'd go for that. it would only be a couple hour drive to his folks that way. there is a compromise here but you both need to be willing to bend a little.|`|BOzeeAN2aa	I believe that sacrifice is 50/50. You've been through it all for him, and hopefully he can respect your feelings and dreams and in time, he'll sacrifice for you. You both have to be happy in a relationship or it causes too much hardship. (Plus, they can always come visit if you move away...) Good luck.|`|ULUpOqplaa	My wife and I ran off to build a place in a rain forest on a tropical island.  While we were in the process one couple we talked to said that they could never abandon their children that way.  I thought that the kids were 12 and 14 or something.  The youngest was 35.  Some people are psycho clingy.  You have my vote, but then most people think I am weird for running off to a tropical island.|`|Z9jlS2bUaa	I totally understand where you're coming from but see these are the things to discuss before marriage. Just continue to stand your ground.. don't cave. Tell him that you guys can come often to visit but you will not live there with them forever. Explain it exactly like you have explained it to us.. maybe even show him this thread. If he sees that you won't budge, he will eventually come around.<br>  btw.. i said this b/c it sounds like you have already sacrificed enough and i know exactly how you feel. This would be a nightmare situation for me and i know exactly what you're going through. It sounds like it's his turn to sacrifice and ensure him that you will still get to see them often. Your reasoning to do this while you both are still young makes so much sense. I mean it's not like they're old and dying and need help. He needs to be fair to you and your new family. A man leaves his parents to join his wife so that they together can be one. His parents know this and probably wouldn't do it if they were in your position. They are just being selfish. Bribe your husband with sex, anything! Just don't let him win this one.. otherwise, you might be really really unhappy especially since you don't even like his parents.

I registered for a lot of different ones, and didn't like most. This one is the best so far, and the best thing is it is free!|`|td6WXhv4aa	Yes it's dangerous a lady where I live here met this guy online on lava life they arranged to have a picnic lunch but it started raining they went back to the guys truck he tried to sexually assault her she scratched his face with a small knife for the cheese and got away she was lucky.|`|Rb087BsAaa	whatever...just like meeting some person at the bar.

Pp6Mz9Mkaa	get over it ... he was probably ugly anyways|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	Do you have a choice in the matter right now. He was on the rebound when you and him met. Now maybe he might have deep feelings for you and is scared he doesn't want to be hurt. So be patient and see what happens if not then move on.|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	This is common for rebounds. I'm sorry this happened to you. Cheer up, ok! :)|`|0fVtHNtmaa	You were rebound.|`|rvSrjNeQaa	Let him go to hell !!|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	forget him and move on|`|gbJ3Pewkaa	same thing happened to me.. take distances... tell him wat u feel... they are so stupid and immature|`|vl8ND1qVaa	well it depends...does he still talk to his x that he dated for a year. if so he may be with her. or maybe someone else idk guys work differently with their realationships. maybe he wants that freedom of now being tied down by a girl right now. i would have to say forget it and move on. there are plenty fish in the sea.|`|5EfJu34taa	i was in the same situation almost 20 days back.even i used to think about this guy continuously after the break-up.those guys just need a gal to cope up with their previous break-up.if he has done this with his previous gf he can do it with you also.i mean he can find a third gf jus like he found a second gf after dumping his first gf.run away from him asap.he's not trustworthy|`|lFTynrRVaa	Don't belive in him, it is good event that you have seen & knew that he is giving date to another girl, he dose not like you rather we wants to get some thing for you or cheat you. So it is better for you to forget him & say him good bye. You will get so many good friends.|`|ccK75CR5aa	You know what I think you should do is that If this person don't what get with you then find somebody else that will love you and be there when you are down in hard trouble. So don't worry about it sweetie you will be just fine without him.|`|lHfiz2xOaa	He could just be hurt and in some need of a friend :) i think you should be his friend for a while|`|NC5GCk5Yaa	go pyscho and stalk his ***...guys like that ****...lol....scream at him in the super market if you see him with another girl....|`|4VjGwauQaa	move on... he is not worth your time. I agree with Mel... you were a rebound.|`|diNrBsexaa	Personally I think he might be really upset with the loss of his girlfriend of a year and it sucks when you are use to being with someone for that long. Do I think he likes you yes but maybe hes just not ready and does want to take things slower.  I would almost take it asa compliment because that means you definitely aren't the rebound girl. If you really like this guy trust him be there for him and if its meant ot be you will get back together.  Good luck!|`|TeQ4RwlRaa	dont be so upset<br>  sometimes we need to clear things in our minds before getting into a new relationship.<br>  <br>  let him go<br>  <br>  just your bad luck he's not ready for it
E9Z41ikJaa	If you find you want to date someone, cool. But don't find someone just to have a bf because you think you ought to. You are fine just like you are. Many people go through HS and never end up liking anyone in a bf kinda way.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying don't go out with them. Just go out with people. Have fun. Let your feelings develop naturally if they do. If not, you've had fun.<br>  <br>  And remember that real good relationships are based on things like mutual trust and enjoyment. Even if you do find someone you like in a bf kinda way, make sure that it's not just a physical bf kinda way because that gets old.<br>  <br>  I have a couple of friends who were friends since kindergarten. Dated once or twice during HS. Went to separate colleges. Now they are married with four children and very happy.<br>  <br>  If a f is going to turn into a bf, let it happen naturally.|`|BO28Mn8haa	guy #1|`|jJZz2U8Gaa	All I can say is that you need to follow your heart. if you're trying to date someone just to have a boyfriend, that's a waste of time. Concentrate on yourself and growing up and being the person you want to be. If you're meant to have a boyfriend in the midst of that, it will happen for you. You shouldn't have to worry about making decisions about boyfriends like this. It's really just a waste of time if you're looking at the big picture.|`|xPQqnIWqaa	I would go with the shy guy. Life is about taking risks. You will never know how something will turn out until you give it a try. I'm a shy guy and I do the exact same thing around girls sometimes. Give him a chance. :)
SovaFpN8aa	So are you married to her? Are you divorcing her?|`|qBtTAgBqaa	I think you got the "married" comment because you put your question in the "Marriage & Divorce" section. You might want to try reposting it in the "Singles & Dating" section.<br>  <br>  And by the way, your links didn't work.|`|DuTeclwuaa	Why isn't this in the "Zit Faced Leg Humping Teenagers" category?|`|hiJ6yKhkaa	links dont work
kqQg7l7Caa	LOL That's such a great question. Ok so I didn't for like the first 5 months, then she farted in front of me and I was like "WHOA" she is a classy woman, I wouldn't expect this from her, but she is so cute, because she goes all red and apologies, now neither of us are afraid to show a little gastric love!lol.|`|TgGmPcn2aa	yes, we have been together for two years and we both have. Belching is not that big of a deal. I still to this point get a little hesitant to fart in front of him but he does and i dont mind it what so ever.|`|z9hyTp0jaa	the men dont seem to care they do it anywere and everywere lol. but women have a bit of respect in tht way. but after u have known them or been goin out with them for ages then u dont care bout it lol.|`|Fa5OPBhjaa	The proper name fo fart is flatulent.... and it all depends but if the other one does it then what should stop you from doing it?|`|5b1cuDUDaa	i couldnt do that in front of my boyfriend, i want him to continue lovin me! lol<br>  <br>  tho he does both :(|`|spVv3Icqaa	ha ha. no that's just embarrising.|`|tcGZFpUoaa	Yes and yes.<br>  <br>  We actually have a code word to let the other person know that we've farted so they can take cover if need be. Our code word is: Tah Dah!!|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	No way!  It's not classy or mature to fart in front of your partner.|`|lHfiz2xOaa	Ive had a bf that would do that ... I learned to get over that though|`|pVaZty4Maa	yup but it took me like two yrs to do it, him he started like a half yr into our relationship :) silly bf.......|`|6R49rIMcaa	my girl fanny farted in my face do you think i care about an *** fart .......NO!!!|`|idKfxUTkaa	Depends, haha. If you both can laugh about it and do it normal. I think the two people are true Friends or Lover if so. I mean come on, it's normal and we all do it. So I'm sure of it.|`|WKsJjPu8aa	yes and yes|`|gplfqOEHaa	With belch the smell is not that bad so one can belch but turn your face away from the people sitting near you. But if you have stomach trouble, then in that case be careful.<br>  <br>  Regarding fart, since the smell is not good for the others, do it only when you are alone.<br>  <br>  The important thing in case of fart/belch is that IF you can prevent the discomfort of the people around you, you MUST do that but only to the point where this effect is achieved. Just take few steps away from people.|`|5d69096a97f9015e41817b901338a7cbaa	I'm married and we do everything in front of each other, once you've been together a while it's not a big deal.  At first we didn't do that stuff around each other though.|`|HVY2rqzfaa	yes to both as well, after 9 years together you get over such formalities and just let rip|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	yes to both|`|D78jfOMZaa	I can't do it...we have been together for 2 years now and if one comes out he'll make so much fun of me and it's a never ending story. But he has no trouble with that...he'll let it rip anywhere.<br>  <br>  It's hard to hold a fart...hold it....hold it...gosh to late!|`|XVygEWLcaa	a girl should NEVER fart/burp in front of their bf. my friend even told me that she tries not to go #2 in her bf's house lol|`|vySVoIbUaa	No and No...(and you shouldn't...)|`|FhrCLLzFaa	Me and my boyfriend belch when we're not in public.<br>  Farting is funny but gross cause it smells bad.<br>  We don't do that|`|YtSGbYqEaa	he does all the time but i never do i dont do it in front of anyone but my sisters|`|EEdzRCQKaa	yeah we both fart/belch when we first met we didnt|`|uIg6an6Jaa	ive belched once cause me and some friends were having a contest <br>  <br>  but hell no never farted|`|xYgFcEfwaa	yes, always.... its fun any medically we shouldnt hold our fart(s).
0H9dvXkmaa	sorry babe but i agree with all of the above|`|jeX5VZAtaa	No leave him alone|`|oojO4WAraa	Of course not.  He doesn't love you - and he doesn't want you.  Get over him. Quit wasting your time.  Find someone who will appreciate you and love you for who you are. <br>  <br>  Do not pursue him. You will appear needy and desperate.  Don't even waste your time looking at him, and certainly do not pursue him.  You deserve a man that pursues you. Don't settle for less.|`|9GmoO5NLaa	To me it sounds like he is messing you around which nobody deserves.  Take a break from him don't talk to him as much and make him realise what he is missing out on.  Then if he does like you he will "chase" after you.<br>  <br>  Never get too caught up with someone!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|y9CgveCGaa	Don't chase a guy.  If you do you'll get hurt.  Let them chase you.  If the one you want doesn't chase you.  Look for another.|`|EJVKqFiHaa	Your starting to love him without him loving you. Back up or back out, either way, don't force it and don't think about him, it only makes it worse.|`|AdeD0xMuaa	Don't chase guys.|`|xKgZAp1Oaa	no, move on there are better guys
cLPimVR6aa	Are you using the child support as meal ticket. Child support is for the kid not for you. Also, his wife has a say where $goes just like he has the right. They are Married and that's what married people do. My wife has 100% say the money that goes out of our home.|`|NB4h4jTyaa	You need to check your divorce decree. If expenditures outside of the child support agreement are not outlined, you either need to get them outlined or start managing your money differently.<br>  <br>  It's not a fair response to say "I spend less on my other kid and he lives a nice life". My friend's ex says 'Groceries don't cost that much for her, she only eats noodles', but she also needs to be clothed, have medical care, have a roof over her head, furniture in her room and have some money saved for college.|`|UUrqECXIaa	If you think you are entitled to more money for child support, than take him back to court. He's right, the support he pays you is for the care of his biological child. He doesn't owe you anything more than that.|`|61720ce500725858e4dbb880a42a20faaa	Correct me if I am wrong, but isn't child support taken out of your ex-husband's check when he gets paid.  If you need more money, get a job. If you were still marry, maybe you would be living a nice life today.|`|DWE6899Paa	HELLO, 1st, The child support is technically for?.... u got the, child. 2nd,For him 2 ask his other for cash, signals she does tha bankin, u dig me?

Are you sure you are spending your money wisely?  Maybe she handles the finances in their relationship.  Find other ways to make more money, rely on you and not them so much.|`|0KLu4hRaaa	If he is paying his child support and you are asking him for additional (non-ordered) money then he has a RIGHT to ask whoever he wants if they think it is a good idea, especially his wife since extra money affects her too. Sounds like you are trying to take him for a ride and getting ticked because you can't get away with it. Get over yourself.
kqQg7l7Caa	Listen up, you need to step in there, a little confidence, a little smile, ask about a new cd or something, then ask leading questions such as how long have you worked here and is that your real hair or something, be imaginative, be charming but not desperate. Flirt, laugh...... THEN Say "listen up you little scoundrel" (well don't say that exactly), you seem like an interesting guy, heres my number, call me sometime, if he does, great, if he doesn't well at least then you know and you can move on. Ultimately you gotta have confidence!|`|ablriuUVaa	thats to easy common!<br>  <br>  ask him what kind of music he likes.<br>  <br>  or tell him what kind of music u like and if theres any bands he recomends.
idKfxUTkaa	He sounds a bit mixed up and not sure of what he wants. You should leave him, and just be if friend to see how things goes. He seems like he likes, and all. He is just confused and lost on what he wants. Not sure if you wants to take it for long term forever or something like that.<br>  <br>  Oh and This is kinda random, but you seem very sweet and nice, and I can see why he likes you. You have a lovely personality. You give it of very well, Haha. So I'm sure if things don't work well with him. You will find some one new in the long run. So if I helped and you would like to talk more, My info is on my profile<br>  ^_^<br>  <br>  (( Just read and thought I sound like I'm a creepy freak, haha. ))|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	Seek professional counseling.  He treated you like a friend and you had a kiss that may have turned into more, if you hadn't have flipped out on him and expected and instant relationship.  Time to grow up.|`|nmiXLhwCaa	Some guys are like that, they are aholes.  Let it go, there are better guys than that out there.  It sounds like he was just using you, since you weren't having sex, I don't know what for then.|`|Ql0gi4rVaa	he played you good and you now need to get revenge
f8ON3dRfaa	Be confident and know what you want.<br>  <br>  If you're very sure you're giving up, then take up the courage to give up totally! It takes time, but tell yourself, you can't take it anymore and you chose to give up.<br>  <br>  Once you know what you really want, and put it into action, you will naturally move on soon enough.<br>  <br>  What you said is really true. They're not willing to change, and there's a high possibility, they can't.<br>  <br>  With this, know what you want for YOURSELF, for YOUR benefit and put it into action.|`|AA10266072	Hang out with some friends and stop talking to him.

hawq3Fneaa	You have got to be kidding!!!   If you are getting married, it should be for love and mutual support, caring, and understanding.<br>  <br>  We are in the 21st century  so welcome to it.  Neither the wife or husband should have main duties of serving and obeying the other.  Women are not objects, and are not owned by men.<br>  <br>  Treat each other as equals, be supportive of each other, and have consideration for each others feelings, desires, and beliefs.<br>  <br>  And both men and women should remember that women have something very important to men under our skirts.  It just might not be available if treated as an object.|`|DlCcFu1eaa	No that's the maid's job.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I think that if you get married, she will keep busy with the duty of not beating you over the head with a skillet.<br>  <br>  Take the notion of "duty" out of your expectations from women if you ever want your wife to feel loved.  Your duty is to love your wife, and this duty is to God, btw.  Her duty is to be submissive to you and likewise, this duty is to God.<br>  <br>  And nowadays, if you marry a woman with a Biblical understanding of her duty to God about this, I guarantee you that she will be well acquainted with the husband's corresponding duty.  lol|`|M43M4KZxaa	marriage is a commitment.to serve is the duty of both husband and wife.the wife choose to obey the husband because he is the man of the house and she believes for what he stands for.a wife must not allow herself to be force in obeying something that she thinks will ruin their relationship and family.|`|iGBMtmYXaa	if i tell that to my gf(who is one of if not the most educated person i know) she will get a hack saw and make kibbles and bits out of me and feed it 2 my two rottweilers. so i would like you to tell that to a woman before you marry her. she will shove her foot soooooo far up your @ss that you will think your gay(no offence to gay men). so next time your thinking about the "good ol' days" remember women and men are equal in marrige and society and in case you have another stupid question like this ill answer it for you yes lynching is illegal @sswipe. your never gonna get married or laid b/c you are an arrogant S.O.B.|`|TUNvbXbgaa	you need to grow up.  women do not have to serve or obey their husbands you are in the USA<br>  when you get married it is 50/50 and you both compromise. with your attitude you will never find yourself a good lady cause no one will put up with your crap|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	Ruth is SO right!<br>  <br>  She deserves the 10 points !!!|`|G7SCwMNeaa	No but hell no!!

OHfZFR31aa	Men do not sign up on dating sites just because they want to role play. They do it because they are looking for an affair. <br>  <br>  I'd write back a few times with just some fun flirtly messages - nothing serious. Then after a few exchanges, say that you are not looking for anything serious but just a casual sexual relationship and see how he responds. Ask him if he could meet you at a hotel one night - then see if he actually shows up. If he does, you'll know for sure he is out to cheat on you, and has probably already done so with other girls.

JhvqUvlsaa	Don't let your ranking on myspace be the judge of how much of a bestie someone is; only let their actions and their words determine that. How does she treat you? Does she still talk to you and make time for you? If she does she is still your bestie and you are hers. If not then she can remain a really good friend and you can find someone else to be your bestie<br>  <br>  Hope this helps

There could be games, etc. for entertainment while people enjoy their tea/refreshments.

rFNN23b1aa	First of all, you are insanely sweet for posting this question, lol. I really think that it's the thought that counts most in relationships so doing things such as you said opening car doors for her and complimenting her are very sweet. You want to keep in mind however that if you become over-bearing with this kind of stuff, she may claim that you're clingy. I think things as simple as calling her just to talk or texting her/writing her a note letting her know that you're thinking of her is thoughtful and simple. But once again, you don't want to do this daily, it'll become too much and potentially cause problems.<br>  <br>  Another thing that you'll want to avoid is being really talkative one day and whatever to ignoring her the next day or not talking to her at all. It's maddening, haha, trust me :).<br>  <br>  I hope this helps...|`|DjMTnSxmaa	ah! ure too cute!<br>  okay i would love if a guy had open a door for me!<br>  also pulling out chairs and taking your jacket! just small things like that!<br>  And hey! i wouldn′t mind getting some red roses either!

Sometimes I report workers for dismissal.<br>  <br>  I once had this fat bastard fired for being messy over a short period of time. It doesn't take much to get fired in this company. I, myself, have been threatened a few times by upper management. Nevertheless, the termination process against me never finalizes because those old bastard executives rotate, jump ship etc.  It's a real "dog eat dog" place.|`|gAC9Ish8aa	Ello!! =D My name is Agnes.

OWIiJMLqaa	Searching for a guy without flaws is like searching for the fountain of youth, you'll spend a lifetime looking and never find one. That's because perfect flawless guys are as fictitious as vampires. As are perfect lives, Stories like Twilight and other romances can't afford to tell it like it really is, otherwise no one would read it, there would be no escape, which is what the story was meant to provide. Make the best of the relationship you have, if you want swept off your feet, provide the opportunity, believe it or not most men aren't mind readers. We have to be told what women want by women. Long talks and long walks with the right guy, will let you truly look into his soul, and if you can find love for you there, and something you love in return, it doesn't get much better than that. Good luck.|`|Xf93fRTTaa	That's a movie. Not real like. Don't expect things to go the way they do in the movies. Ever.<br>  <br>  I mean, my own relationship is as close to a romantic movie as it could be with just the right amount of comedy mixed in. But I'm very lucky.<br>  <br>  If you're happy with the one you have, see where it goes. If you're not, don't .|`|clsTSNkEaa	I'm sure Twilight has had that effect on many people but what you need to remember is its all fiction and I'm not saying relationships like that aren't real but if you love him and he loves you what is really wrong with the relationship you have? Also there is such thing as overprotective <br>  ;D
JlDcVTVsaa	you probably made her angry and then fall sleep. <br>  ask her if you did some thing last night to upset her.|`|HHyny0JSaa	There's obviouly some emotional distance between the two of you. Your best bet is to sit down and talk it out with her. Things like that are usually the beginning of the end of a relationship. If you want to save it you guys need to figure out whats wrong and how to fix it. Communication is the key to a good relationship
OsFLwPd7aa	I think the theory is that if you are meant for someone, you will somehow be drawn together almost by gravity; that no matter what you do you will somehow find each other. If this is really the case, then you can stop looking! Go about your life, do whatever it is you wish to do, make yourself happy, and somehow he will fall into your lap. It does seem with everyone I know that when they give up looking that is when they find the right person for them. When you go out looking for someone to fill that role, wanting so badly for it to happen- that is when you make bad mistakes and pick the wrong people. Relax and enjoy life for what it is.|`|BfDM12ptaa	the tought is sweet, but u need to get out of 'filmi' life....just be practical and find him....|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	Yes U will find him|`|WMR8hVlfaa	Under the couch.

SqzoZe4Laa	They don't just "throw" people in jail, especially if their is no pay order. It is my belief that all fathers should pay child support to the mother of their child, at least until the child is old enough to support themselves (let's say they move out at 17 (not likely, but possible), or the more likely secerio - the child chooses to go to college, in that case the father should pay directly to the child, or an account should be set up (a trust), and money should be debited from his paycheck and directly deposited into the account unitl the child finishes college. I wholeheartedly believe that your GF should go after these 2 for child support, but let me tell you one thing - it IS RETROACTIVE in all 50 states, so just because they are not paying now, when it boils down to it and the judge sets the support order, he will determine the date of the child's birth and then multiply the amount of time that has passed since birth time the amount currently set, and that will be considered an "arrearage", which that guy will then get to pay a certain ADDITIONAL  percentage of on top of the standard 20% that will be deducted from his check. So, realisticallly, she could boost the income for helping with the children ASTRONOMICALLY IF SHE WENT AFTER THESE TWO GUYS, but there is no harm in waiting as long as she does it BEFORE THEY TURN 18. In alot of states, the judge will simply say "You obviously didn't need the money, or you wouldn't have waited until he would have been no longer legally obligated to pay", and she will get nothing, so truthfully, the sooner the better, but do it!!! Jeez, doesn't she need money for the mortgage and the cars and food and clothes and maybe take the kids to the movies once in a while? Women need to wake up and stop being so kind hearted to the men who impregnated them. My ex stopped taking the pill without telling me. That was 10 years ago. Now we have a 9 year old that I almost never see and I pay $400 a month in support. -john in iowa|`|fXAmnWTyaa	Well the only thing is that a lot of times if support is established, that means there must be a type of joint custody, meaning the kids will have to see their father. However, if you can prove in court that he is dead beat and may harm the children or be a threat to them, you can just get the money granted to you.<br>  Definitely have the other thrown in jail. He deserves it.|`|GmaDTTEJaa	Well it sounds like she has a job and is trying really hard to make ends meet and it's just not happening, so yes I would agree that trying to get child support would help.<br>  <br>  I know woman who use child support so they don't have to get a job and can just be free loaders all their life. I don't agree with that at all.<br>  <br>  But like I said it sounds like your gf is really trying and the law tends to side with women in these things. If her ex's won't pay she can get money from the state then the state will go after her ex's for the money.|`|8tXIkdLMaa	You keep talking about them not doing anything, and your baby's mother is taking care of everything. Are you doing anything. You be a man, get off yahoo answers and do something. Try a damn paper route. Something. Times are hard for everyone.|`|2HznXhPcaa	a man should pay for his own kids. now you should go to courts and they should take money of his pay checks.       sweet mildred sent me here to help you out.|`|prrseqdKaa	SHAME.  If you want to see the Deadbeat Dad, look in the mirror, you lazy good for nothing excuse for a father.<br>  <br>  Get a job!  Man up and take care of your kids!|`|VqilAWDGaa	Yes she should pursue child support. Their fathers are deabeats, but that's no excuse for them not to Man up and take care of their kids.|`|3uWCmNCsaa	They should, but good luck getting them to.|`|ch93aYF3aa	Yes, they should pay child support. No ifs, and or buts about it. That is what a father has to do. Getting it from them, that's another thing.<br>  <br>  You say you are the full time caretaker of the children, two not yours. That you want to put them in daycare. To me it doesn't seem like you are going a bang up job when you can't take them to a park during the day or evening. Why would you want them to eat what they want or watch what they want at daycare? Is that what they do now while you are taking care of them? Not good for them. They have to learn to eat what you can provide them with and watch what is appropriate to their ages and not spend their lives in front of a tv or playing video games. And, mr caretaker, why can't you get the laundry done with these two kids in school all day? You only have a two year old to look after. What are you doing all day? Who's going to watch these kids in their own pool if you don't have time now to do the laundry?<br>  <br>  You could get a job in the evenings after mommy gets home, if you want these things for the children. Even a few hours a night, a saturday and sunday when she is home can bring in additional cash. Look into it. Or, with your experience, you could open a daycare facility...or work in one.<br>  <br>  What does mommy think about her x's paying support? She may not even want them to know where she is.|`|l4DIIB7waa	Why don't you marry her and step up yourself?  Or aren't you MAN enough?|`|AA11967247	at that point i think i'd rather they signed away all rights and be done with them all together.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Her exes are obligated to pay child support if there is court mandated child support. The ex in Florida would not normally go to jail - the first step would be to have his wages garnished if he is not paying. Your gf needs to contact the family court who set the child support payments and inform them of non compliance by her ex. They will take care of it.|`|FewhKlx9aa	I would definitly get the support due her for the kids.The fact that it would go to court and end up costing her money maybe she feels it's not worth it,as far as she's concerned he's out of their lives as I'm sure he does'nt even see the kids.You do get one free councel with an atty but again big bucks and who is to say he will pay anyway..|`|36PrVK7Oaa	Shouldn't she be about ready to dump you to find a father for her next child? What you should do is adopt all the children and get a job as a plumber and you will do fine. You are in southeast ohio, right ?|`|rPT4J5YLaa	Yes they should pay child support and she can get all the back support from when they were first born she just has to ask for it.|`|2uZivThaaa	Most of these people are stupid. Its obvious that YOUR GIRLFRIEND AND YOU have jobs and you are being a man and taking care of your child and CHILDREN THAT ARENT EVEN YOURS! I commend you on that and its great that you care about these children enough to give them a good father figure to look up to! The ex's should pay support because they fathered these children so they should take care of them and care enough about their kids to at least contribute a little to the life that they deserve!|`|SovaFpN8aa	I smell a Troll.<br>  Your girlfriend pays the bills - she has a job,<br>  You are full-time caregiver - you do not have a job,<br>  You think it is important for the kids to swim in their own pool - you have a pool, but complain that you need more money.<br>  If you are not a Troll, my deepest sympathies go out to those kids!|`|djUMvICoaa	Why are you pursuing this after you have a kid with her?  She should have had that all taken care of as soon as those kids were born.  Where's her head?  Where was yours that you didn't care until now?  I agree they should be paying but she is going to look kind of dumb going into court now, but she still has to do it..|`|UUrqECXIaa	I agree with you, the ex's need to pay their share. <br>  <br>  My ex never paid his share for the support of our two children. I never pursued it because he made my life a living hell, and in trying to punish me, he hurt our kids more. I worked a full and a part-time job to support them myself.|`|cLPimVR6aa	It sounds like your GF sleeps around often and that's what happen when you have 100 kids with 100 different daddy's. Why do not you be men and pay all bills? How about at least supporting your own kid?|`|AA12088024	you just said she pays all the bills and you didnt include yourself so im assuming your doing something that separates you from these other men so yes if she can do it then yes|`|97nXJF24aa	yeah they should take care of their children|`|E7RhMRKhaa	Yes, men should pay.  Contact child support agency where you live...
VFdC2wPlaa	Try telling your parents that you are doing more things and that you want one for safety reasons. Tell them that you want it incase there are emergencies. Don't mention that you only want it for texting or else the answer will probably be no.  When i wanted a cell i had to tell my parents i would pay for it before they would agree. You could also try that and see if it works. The best plan for someone who want it to be cheep is a pay and talk plan. You can add unlimited texting for 10$ a month and then your minutes are 25 cents per min.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped... Good luck!!!|`|1tYw97CRaa	JUST ASK THEM!!!<br>  there are plenty of other things that are harder to talk about with your parents, joining the army, coming out of the closet, telling them you want to be an exotic dancer, etc. <br>  but a cell phone? it sounds like it would really benefit you, and your lifestyle., just tell them everything that you told us.  it's not hard.|`|C3aDxutiaa	call your dad when he's home and put the phone down as he picks it up and you bring up sub|`|70a43707807dc9900f19f111a38b3d42aa	Umm idk I think you should just talk to them honestly and maturely. Not beg them. Just give them your reasons nicely (all the reasons you just told us up there^) and they should buy you one. Make sure,however, you don't tell them that you pretty much only want a cell phone for texting because that is a deal breaker for them. They don't want you to get distracted and all that stuff so yea just don't say it so bluntly like that like you told us. Oh, and Metro PCS is pretty cheap. No contract. Unlimited everything for about $35 a month and it's UNLIMITED contract like I said. Goodluck|`|UUrqECXIaa	Your parents would be able to contact you any-time is a good idea, and then tell them you will get a job and pay for the phone and the plan yourself. Of course, follow through with this.|`|LMITClMnaa	u should tell them how are they gonna contact u when ur on ur trips or how r u gonna contact them when u need something. idk. i was suppose to get my phone when i was 14 but i got it when i was 12 & i offered my mom that i would buy the phone & something bad happened to the family so my parents were driving in & out of the state & i had to go to these places for school so my bros were left to take care of me. so yah i convinced my mom to get me one.|`|yLPZ7gkkaa	thats all we need is someone else texting up a storm.<br>  one of my friends never had a cellphone and now that she finally got one(shes 16 too)<br>  she NEVER STOPS TEXTING<br>  and when shes talking to you. its all "uuhh wait. i too busy texting 2 talks 2 u" <br>  <br>  BS.<br>  <br>  and she doesnt pay attention while shes texting.<br>  same with everyone else. their texting is more important than their reallife conversations|`|oHO0XOQVaa	Stage a kidnapping. While on the trip.|`|GChWTGNiaa	Use a pay phone<br>  I made the mistake of asking for a cellphone in 7th grade, and I never use it. Plus it won't die. It's one of those big, blocky ones with an antennae..I've kicked it, thrown it, dropped it, snapped it, broken pieces off, everything, but it WILL NOT DIE. I finally messed up the screen, but a few days later the line through the date disappeared and it was normal. I broke the flipping lid thing, and days later it started working perfectly again. And it's always tripping me, always right behind my feet for some reason. I think it wants to kill me. This has been going on for yeasr.. Don't get a phone, especially one possessed by demons like mine.

4bDPhnCKaa	i don't think so|`|FNCohXNiaa	yes it determins wether your straight or not, in the context of love which is not friendly love, but "partner love"<br>  for example, if u are a boy and you have love for another boy, then it means you are gay.if you have love for another girl, it means you are straight<br>  fa i think there is a big difference!i hope i didnt misunderstand your question.<br>  ---<br>  lol i know i did, can  u explain to  me then :-)
GqI8wY8Iaa	Next time your talking, casually ask her if she would like to get a coke. Your treat.|`|xPQqnIWqaa	Maybe she has things that come up while you are talking.  It is great that she talks to you at school though. Maybe she just prefers to talk in person rather than on MSN.|`|b756601817682c20304a5eaee7ad4382aa	Well here i am again helping out my friends from a far. hello my friend the name is lyonel and man this is not a hard one to deal with. i was in the same spot you where in at one time? friend be careful not to fall for some of these things, i had a girl talk and txts me ,back and forth we talked and some days i would not hear from her strange it was i got to worrying about her and boom she talks to me agin but her words was i was busy had a lot to do but she did this much too many times and i found out she was living two lives one with me as a pass by friend and the other was the life she livied with others. what i mean is she was just not really into me but just being friendly.so be careful not fall in love or get too close to females who just want to talk and nothing more  cause you might get hurt.so just take it slow and see where it gos my friend you never know what may come of it. so stay on the road to knowing her and be careful and look out for your heart. I hope this little bit of info helps.Hay let me know how this works out for you.(crowiilewis@yahoo.com)|`|y7D34AXIaa	well if she talks to you on msn for 10-20 min she prob a lil into you but dont always talk to her first becuz then its makes it to easy and girls dont like that so wait for her to come to you some times or she might back away <br>  and become more flityyy <br>  <br>  but if she backs away stop tryin and wait for her to come to you
AA11647373	Honestly, that wouldn't affect me at all, I'm engaged and dont' engage in conversations of the like.<br>  But being a girl here's what I will honestly say<br>  " If I found out my friend was well endowed it would make me consider being 'more friendly' it just sort of attracts me. I would think differently because we all wonder what's down there. If we know, then it helps ease things."<br>  But as afore mentioned, I am engaged and those things don't exactly matter. I've matured a lot, we'll say.
gRXy66dOaa	here is some advice:<br>  1. let her do the talking and you just listen to her, women like to talk and be heard<br>  2. if you like her, tell her how pretty she is compare to other girls<br>  3. make her laugh, women like to laugh, they like guys with great humor|`|BL4PEjAWaa	don't look at their boobs or bottom.  nothing sexual.  no dirty jokes.

7WomqDuEaa	this may sound really childish...but hide and seek in the dark is way fun & hilarious. or you could play glow in the dark volleyball. you splatter glow in the dark paint on some old shirts (so you don't bump into each other) & some paint on the ball (so you don't get hit in the face) it sounds weird but give it a try. Good Luck :]|`|sN6gN3p2aa	you should have a scavenger hunt. split into two or three groups. make a list of what you can find in the mall. if u find an item take a picture next to it. also make sure you have a prize like the losing group has to pay for lunch. <br>  <br>  you could also go ice skating, roller blading or something else.<br>  hope i helped. have fun.
JXrvbW7caa	I don't see anything wrong with since she's almost an adult anyway|`|6CPFRnGraa	If you both care for each other I would say it would be fine, but due to the legality of adults going with underage individuals, I would suggest you wait until you are at least 18 before starting a real relationship, just to avoid dealing with the law.|`|McFPh6Aoaa	I think that it doesnt matter the age. I think you can share your feelings and all, but I dont think you should go publice with it until you at least turn 18 or are out of high school......|`|WS6X8hLkaa	Be patient and wait a few years,<br>  <br>  At 17 you could still be liable for statutory rape in many states should you have sex with someone who is not an adult.

If he just wants to date you and get to know you then it's one thing, but if he ever, ever starts pushing you for sex then he is a creep and you need to lose him.  He should be waiting until you're 18 though.

Generally though, if a guy thinks he's falling for a friend, or a girl he as no chance with he'll distance himself so that he wont sy something to make it awkward or make him look like a total loser.|`|HKHCuRI8aa	he might be just chillling cause he is a bit scared,or he is comfortable,now he doesnt't need to be up your butt all day, or he has you and can be with buddies more, or he might be checkin out the field for more sweet stuff.??|`|ablriuUVaa	if they want to be with them they wont run off<br>  <br>  if they fall for them but wants to get distant to not fall in love, what would u wanna be witha  jerk like that anyway<br>  <br>  if a guy really wants the girl, he wont run away.
509248920483afa8396e2237322a94beaa	I had a relationship like that.  We were both in the track team in a secondary school.  She was my first girlfriend.  We just held hands and kissed, nothing more.  Girls are more mature than guys of the same age.  I think mentally you are not too far from each other.  Since you are a christian, I think you will treat her with respect.  So long as you don't make her do things she doesn't want, you will be ok.|`|kzIVGEfgaa	The only thing is that when you're younger like that, peole tend to not take you seriously and think it's gross but if you put it in the large perspective, MANY couples have an age difference like that. <br>  <br>  If you truly care for her, don't let what other people say affect you. But if you think you should wait a few year, tell her that. She SHOULD understand but if not, I'm sorry|`|26KPiekKaa	Your age DOES matter in this situation.  You could get arrested in some countries if you do that.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Nah as long as you don't make her do things she's not ready for it'll be fine.|`|6Vaaqle0aa	Age doesn't matter when your both consenting to going out together.<br>  As long as you don't try anything funny with her or push her into different things, everything will be perfectly fine. <br>  <br>  Age is merely a number and you have to overlook this, and keep your ehad high no matter what anyone says.<br>  As long as your in love, it's worth fighting for, no matter what the age difference.<br>  <br>  Good luck, pal|`|8PHquJwYaa	Keep going with the relationship. If two people are truly in love, age doesn't matter-what matters is the feeling! Stay close to your girlfriend and do your best to make her feel good when she's with you.|`|OYGGdSLcaa	age never really matters on love. however, if her parents hate you, you night want into check local age of consent laws, just in case they decide to go nazi on her and you being kept apart.|`|Y2iEM9jcaa	it dosent really matter what age you are as long as you love her and she loves you thats all that matters<br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|htWw0OlCaa	Yes age matters in this situation, you could end up in jail....No matter if you are a christian or not, feelings change and things happen, so I would be careful if I were you.|`|MOALoKWdaa	it shouldnt really matter, the thing that matters if you both want each other
wAB6NjRRaa	can u give a proper explanation ?|`|HHyny0JSaa	Because some girls out there, like the friends you have lost and your new friend from the gym, are extremely insecure. Sounds like she just needs it to be validated in order to feel good about herself. Just be lucky that you know you are beautiful and don't need to stop random strangers to prove it. There is nothing more unattractive than insecurity. And real friends will support your modeling dream and be happy for you, instead of being jealous|`|294kSBhyaa	she's insecure and has no self-esteem. what "friend" would do that? dump the dumbass and move on with your life. you will find friends who don't feel the need to try to put you down just to make themselves feel better.|`|bxA9ZfYVaa	Girls can be really insecure and jealous. We are really critical of ourselves, and it seems like this girl felt the need to reassure herself pretty bluntly in front of you! It's pretty obvious that she sees you as being 'the pretty one' and felt bad about herself. It's not your fault, it's just how girls can be stupid sometimes. I know I am critical of others and myself a lot too... I guess it's just part of being a girl (although I'm not justifying it! It was a really jerky thing for her to say!)<br>  All I can say is try not to take it personally, girls just over-analyze things and criticize too much sometimes...|`|mUSzHFeWaa	Because chics are freakin scandelous. You don't know this by now? I have no idea why yall feel the need to torture one another, but as a dude I think it's a hell of a way to treat a friend. This girl sounds jealous of your looks, btw.|`|d6c86f7baca11ad3525ca1a7ee0ecd06aa	sounds like she is a little jealous or just overly competitive.  If you aren't shallow like she is then I would drop her looks fade true friends last forever|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	stop hanging out with her, she's just mean|`|MeGehliuaa	It sounds like jealousy but maybe you should hear your friends' sides of the story too. You might be doing something subconsciously that is annoying them|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Because she's jealous. That's all. Don't ever hang out with her again.|`|Ql0gi4rVaa	girls are mean<br>  especially to hot women<br>  your sex is viscious<br>  send me your pic so i can tell you how great youlook|`|EEdzRCQKaa	some one has already asked this question today think of your own|`|8Ypkfr7jaa	Tell her, "pfsssh yeah he's being funny" lol|`|Y2iEM9jcaa	thats really rude and i recon she is just using you just to make you jelous|`|fPHjh4Jsaa	because she is a *****|`|iBH7NTl3aa	sounds like she's deluded hun|`|U4Rf1rjuaa	well, it sounds like maybe since you started modeling the reason why your friends have dwindled down is because maybe you have gotten to cocky about it. You may not realize that you come across that way , but take it into consideration that maybe you make them feel bad about themselves. How often do you talk about your appearence and career? Do you allow people to feel equal or less than you.It's nice to feel confident and beautiful, but not conceeded!|`|5ujJNemcaa	What is there to rub? Obviously the 'cute' guy doesn't like your type. Look at it this way, you're a model, she's not. You're in magazines and papers, she's not. You're hot to (most) guys, she's not.<br>  <br>  The thing is about models. They're kinda intimidating to guys and girls alike. To girls, mostly jealousy. As for guys, it is more of an unapproachable goddess, too good for me etc. etc. You get what I mean.<br>  <br>  So, go out there and be friendly. Even though your girlfriends are nasty to you. Show that you are more than looks. Show them you have substance. After all, not ALL women are nasty.... just MOST of them. XD|`|bRVl31GSaa	If you ask me she is just jealous that you a model and she isn't so dont worry you must be prettier.|`|hp0Vvkn7aa	cuz shes a stuck up ******.........do u rlly want her as a friend......do u
rvSrjNeQaa	What do you mean !! are you jealous !!|`|f0173000dda40d230a0442e8832073d1aa	Well, I don't know you but it could be that you're rather full of yourself and not interested in anyone else.<br>  <br>  That is certainly how your question reads and that's all you're giving us to base our opinions on.<br>  <br>  Face it, you're too beautiful to live amongst the rest of the world.<br>  <br>  How sad for you.|`|xbzCxo8yaa	Because unfortunately, you are dealing with GIRLS not women~~~|`|oDLdqrJfaa	Because that will statistically increase the chances of them getting laid.|`|B6cOlFU9aa	It sounds like you have lots of women who are jealous of you|`|fznvQptlaa	jealousy honey|`|NC5GCk5Yaa	find new friends.....oh....girls are bitches and like taking what they can't have...like little kids looking at the cookie jar....hahaha|`|AA11632061	jealous...why else. FIGHT for what is yours!<br>  good luck|`|Ks1uiHReaa	get over urself, its all in ur head|`|4bDPhnCKaa	thy r jealous at u
BKr3y30maa	I don't think I would call it "betraying".  I think it is normal.  The problem is is that they like each other.  Unfortunately, the right thing to do is to just continue to be friends with the both of them and accept it if they get into a relationship. I know it will be hard and that it hurts hearing this, but in time it won't hurt as much.  And you might find someone yourself that you actually like more than you did this guy.  Email me if you have any questions.|`|ablriuUVaa	if he likes ur best friend i dont think its betreyal, if ur best firned like him it would be different<br>  <br>  honestly just tell him already u have nuttin too loose|`|gbJ3Pewkaa	this is a bit betraying..
oB1WQJHgaa	how does he feel about it? maybe you need to ask him how he feels... is he all weird about it? just forget it and let it go... :)|`|gT1Ger8faa	If you feel gay and you know that you're not then prove yourself wrong.Try by stepping up your game to show it.Prove girls wrong about what they think but still be real...|`|O2RNsEOraa	((This is why I don't drink..))<br>  Is it OK to make out with your best bro? No not exactly. You should score a a great girl and make her your girlfriend so you can reassure everyone that you or your friend are NOT gay and like women very much. <br>  And don't get so God dam-ed wasted next time.<br>  Plus, don't ever actually do what a bunch of low-life tricks tell you to do, especially if you're drunk out of your ***.<br>  <br>  Edit-Nooo, do NOT ask him how he feels about it. Who cares? Like Timon said, you gotta put your past behind ya.|`|cRxUstdCaa	That's completely normal.  So, back in my first couple years of college, I met my husband.  Back then, though, he was just this crazy guy that had fun when he was drinking.  He and his best friend made out with each other, then both made out with me.  His best friend ended up more weirded out than him, but I was the most freaked.  Once we all drank again, talked about it honestly, and laughed through it, everything was good again.  It was like an insta-awkwardness removal.  I did, for several years, wonder if maybe he had a things for guys, but I think it was that one friend in particular.  He was attracted to the kind of guy he was as a friend and an intellectual even though he isn't gay.  Want to really make the situation better?  Pick a really hot girl, and share her with your buddy in bed one night.  Did this as well.  They never put anything in each other, but they spent the whole night working together to please me.  After that I didn't care if they WERE gay.  :)|`|A4hyDNH6aa	I would just ask him how he felt about the whole situation & all, to see if u guys are still really cool wit eachother eventhough u 2 sort of made out wit eachother jus 2 get some girls horny. I mean if I was in yo situation, I'd totally do it.|`|hpHaofpnaa	Ahh screw it you were drunk. That sh17 happens bro. As long as you guys were ok with it I just wouldn't mention it again. EVER.
hpHaofpnaa	Don't worry girl you look fine, she's just a b17ch. Don't let her get too you.|`|dlUgJ5Obaa	are u really sisters?<br>  <br>  EITHER WAY, to look like her? u need a miracle indeed
ICel15qYaa	just b a good freind<br>  if she needs help u can help her if u know that what ur doing is right<br>  dont try to steal her bf, and stay close<br>  thats about it<br>  and freinds doing stuff for each other is what friends r for so dont feel guilty about not helping her as much
AA10596340	13 really is too young, and the fact that you are scared is your instinct telling you the answer - don't do this.<br>  <br>  I chose to do it for the first time when I was just 14. Not only do I regret it now, but I now know that at that age, neither myself or my girlfriend were physically or mentally mature enough to fully appreciate the experience.<br>  <br>  You will not be missing anything if you wait. In fact, you will be doing yourself a favor by giving yourself a "future gift" in the sense that when you turn 18 or 20, and are truly ready and committed to your b.friend or husband at that time, you can fully enjoy it without being scared, risking the trust of your parents, or being hurt. (Just so you know, for many girls, no matter what the age, it does hurt the first time, so maybe that is enough to help you make your decision.)|`|7iEk06aDaa	Your way to young to be thinking of having sex, honey. There is so much responsibility that goes along with it. No offense, but that your parents are actually letting you go and stay with your boyfriend says alot. I can't even imagine a 13 yr. old having phone sex, and call me old fashioned, but I think it's terrible the way todays generation thinks so casually about sex. I did n't even know what a french kiss was at thirteen and your having phone sex? unbelievable....|`|BgZA7lvQaa	It seems like you are not ready.  Stick with phone/computer sex.  Concentrate on school, family, and friends.  Wait until you are mature.|`|0e4wLPhgaa	At thirteen, your definitely not ready for sex, especially if your boyfriend is thirteen to. If, all the correct procedures are taken, like the use of condoms and such, then maybe you are "prepared", theoretically speaking for sex, but you need to mentally prepare yourself. Most boys wanna get in, and then get out. Think about it before doing anything rash.|`|fLMc72q4aa	You may think that you're ready, but you're not.   13 is way too young to be thinking about it.|`|iuzLxZPhaa	you are way to young. Stop and really think about this.|`|AA11043457	Don't do this.  You are way too young.  You have plenty of time to find out about sex when you are older.  You could get pregnant. You could get a sexually transmitted  disease as if he is contemplating this, he may have had sex with others.<br>  <br>  You should finish high school and concentrate on that and in meeting many boys. You need to find out what things  you like about a guy, in how he treats you, in what he does, not with sex. That is the last thing  you need to know before you select one for a lifetime.  You should be going out with more guys, with just getting to know some.  My kids and grandkids don't date until they are 16.  They still get to know kids and do some things in groups.  they are going to college and will have plenty of time.<br>  <br>  So could you.  I have this  young friend who is the son of a friend's grandson and she was going to come to Florida to visit here and go to Disney, but she got pregnant at 17 and has a baby and didn't get to come.  She has to look at getting a job. He is still in school and they fight from time to time and sometimes he is a BF and sometimes he isn't.  But that baby has no real mother and no real father. He has kids who are more like a brother and sister and are not responsible.  So he will be as messed up as they are.  How will they support him or themselves?  She got her a job as a waitress.  That might be fine to get through high school, but she isn't going to high school now.  Says she will get her GED.  That could be  you.  Stuck in a dead end job that will never support her properly.  Maybe living with or may be married to a guy who can't support her either and may be running around on her.  Her own mother has 3 kids by 3 fathers.  She is headed in the same direction.  Is that what you want with your life?. If so, having sex at your young age is the step to get  you there, being a burden on society when you could be a contributing member of society.  <br>  WAIT.<br>  <br>  Your parents are considering letting you go because they trust you and this is how  you would repay that trust?  And if they find out, and I'm betting they will, then they will never be able to trust you again.  It hurts love not to be able to trust someone. So you are not loving them enough when you break that trust. You are not ready for love and certainly not ready for sex.  Even using condoms, accidents happen as well, but the loss of trust is a greater one even if  you don't get pregnant. And  you can get married the first time, even if he tries to withdraw.|`|NBTuFkCFaa	First, if you're scared, you're obviously not ready. And second, having sex when you just became a teenager is a really bad idea. It would hurt your parents if you went back on them and did this. I've had friends who had sex at your age and already have kids at age 15. Please don't make the same mistake as them. Although I'm in no position to tell you what to do, if you decide to have sex with this boy, at least be protected. You also know if you get caught, whoever is older, is going to jail right? You'd be under the age of consent. Anyways, good luck.|`|MRxm67DPaa	honey ur 13 ur mierly still a baby and look ur parenmts trust u and they trust u not to do that i know wat ur goin threw im 15 and me and my bf wore in the same sitiation once u see him and he starts feeling on u ull want it but if i wore u i would rather wait look loseing ur virginity is a big deal and like lose it to some1 u know ur gonna be wiuth for the rest of ur life im engaged to gilberto and im always gonna love him becuase i know hes always gonna be there for me and u should make sure that guys always gonna be there for u look <br>  in the end its wat u want dont listen to me im only tryen to help u and only u knows wats best for u and only u can decid ur life not anybodys else we can only help by giveing advice so my advice is to do wat u feels right take kare hun bye betty|`|jtVRjZJRaa	Don't do it you are way too young and probably don't know everything about it and will make life-changing mistakes.|`|XvWHlfkkaa	if youre scared you arent ready.
e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	What is that all about Obama and Stimulus where r we here???<br>  Marriage and Divorce or what? What brought politics to this area?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  _K_|`|LVZdzPmpaa	There are some tax benefits, nothing that will make any difference. There are no provisions for cash payouts, which is what most people believe they're going to get. <br>  <br>  Obama signed a bill providing millions of dollars to resettle the poor, Palestinian terrorists from Gaza in the U.S. This bill includes housing, food, medical care, education, job training and the like. Few people are aware of this expenditure and the press did not cover it at all. The order was signed Jan. 27, 2009 and entered into the Federal Register on Feb. 4. (see below)<br>  <br>  Most "new immigrants" do not contribute to our economy. They are here to sap the system and contribute to their own economies (terrorism) back home. "New immigrants" should not be a consideration of any kind in a "stimulus" package. They are only a drain.<br>  ----------------<br>  Obama Decrees: Massive Immigration of Hamas Refugees from Gaza <br>  by Lou Dobbs<br>  Obama has signed a presidential determination allowing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to resettle in the United States. Sure, what can go wrong when we allow hundreds of thousands of people who have been, as Mark Steyn memorably described, "marinated" in a "sick death cult," who voted for Hamas, and 55% of whom support suicide bombings live here and at the American taxpayers' expense:<br>  By executive order, on January 27, (Federal Register on February 4) Obama has ordered the expenditure of $20.3 million in urgent migration assistance to the Palestinian refugees and conflict victims in Gaza to resettle in the United States.<br>  Few on Capitol Hill took note that the order provides a free ticket replete with housing and food allowances to individuals who have displayed their overwhelming support of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) in the parliamentary election of January 2006 at US taxpayers expense.<br>  Let's review some of Obama's most recent actions since he was inaugurated a little more than two weeks ago:<br>  ? His first call to any head of state as president was to Mahmoud Abbas, leader of Fatah party in the Palestinian territory.<br>  ? His first one on one interview with any news organization was with Al Arabia television.<br>  ? He ordered Guantanamo Bay closed and all military trials of detainees halted.<br>  ? He ordered all overseas CIA interrogation centers closed.<br>  ? He withdrew all charges against the masterminds behind the USS Cole and 9/11.<br>  ? Today we learn that he is allowing hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refuges to move to and live in the US at American taxpayer expense. <br>  So We can't pay our own bills. Our economy is dying, hundreds of thousands of people are losing their jobs, and now we will pay to move terrorists and their supporters to live free in our country? What about the thousands of our brave soldiers who gave their lives to fight these terrorists?  Obama insulted the Medal of Honor Award winners at their Inauguration Ball by being the first President in over 40 years to not show up and now he inviting their very enemies to come live in our country at our expense?  Why not just send all of our weapons over there and allow them to kill us now?  It will be less painful!<br>  Now you see why the founding fathers wanted to protect us from a president with devided loyalties! Now do you see why congress and the Supreme court should have made Obama show proof of natural born citizenship.|`|E7RhMRKhaa	Ooohhhhh ,  I thought by the first line you were talking a different stimulus......Right now a shaky stock market, housing values in the toilet, millions more flocures in the next year,  banks that take billions and won't lend, credit card companies that are doubling rates, even their best customers ,  family incomes devastated with job losses, construction at a standstill,  etc. , etc., etc......We can begin where the federal government,  under the direction of f.e.m.a.,  had the most recent disastor in New Orleans.  Years leter their remains much to clean up.  Much to rebuild.   You want construction jobs ?  Give billions to the E.P.A. and clean up the various sites.   Invest in our country and buy back all homes in forclosure.  All the bad property for pennies on the dollar as the banks do.  Hold on to them, offer those can a very small interest rate. Rent them at a small rate. Then when jobs return sell them back...Let the banks wiith their schemes fail...Oh well.....We need jobs, need'em bad.....Need to sell G.M. and Ford cars to those in the car rental business.......The next purchase , large or small, just do it.....We need the jobs.

Millions and millions of good people making good wages and benefits, some for generations,   Paid for new roads and schools.  If they say they cannot afford the retirement costs,  let them fail their current scheme, buy the debt nationally for said retirees, along with their plants, hire a new staff, and go into the car business.......return the lost manufacturing  of parts to the U.S.......We need the jobs.....Make clothes here instead of in China.    Jobs, jobs, jobs.....Millions of them.....We get about $15 per week in income tax reduction.    Mind you only for those employed.   There are tax incentives for those who purchase a home...???

wBSkGfxjaa	My husband was married before, twice, and between marriages he had relationships. He tells me (back then) he never cheated and will not now. I believe him. But -- this is the important part -- he admits at times to just wanting to have sex with some women, one of which, over 15 years, between and after divorces (both of which he wanted). That woman (and there were others) was -- as he says now -- was just plain sexy, hot, available and put no demands on him. They worked in the same industry and met a conferences, during travel and at her home, where she had a hot-tub, great food....  Others -- he explains -- surprised him by making their moves or inviting him to make the moves at professional meetings, so there were lots of one-nighters and a few follow-up times.  My husband is nice looking, great body and not imposing so I see why others (and me) would like intimate times with him.....SO a long answer to your question is, yes, there can be sex without love for both men and women.  Hope this is of value to you.|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	The question about whether cheating men associate love with sex is irrelevant. Many men cheat...so do women. There are also good, decent men around. Not all men cheat.<br>  <br>  What IS important, however, is how YOU feel about your cheating husband and his 4-year relationship. (Yes...you read well. A relationship. An affair lasts for weeks or months. But something that goes on for 4 years is not an itch or an affair. )<br>  <br>   IF you think you can forgive and forget, fine. <br>  <br>  But if you cannot---then it's time you sought professional help (like therapy or counseling) so you can figure out how to rebuild your life -after getting a divorce.<br>  <br>  Good luck. Be aware...Liars, cheaters and abusive men never change.|`|ecd46de3f5db92b6d26c258002cf6b8faa	I would say after 4 years you would know what she does and you will not.|`|PZStgtdKaa	Did you ask him why?

That's a long affair.|`|GGSSxFsUaa	Why would you believe anything this man says. This is an excuse to cover the 4yr lie! Wake up lady and leave this loser. <br>  <br>  The fact he risked his family and marriage for 4yrs and not love this woman is more of an insult to you. He was willing to give up everything for sex! You do think you should be your husbands everything, right?<br>  <br>  Please don't be a fool and fall for this con again.

I knew that with him being nice to her in anyway, she'd fall for him.  Anyways, he started to date her in October right before I left for a 10 month program in NH.  Since then, which has been from Oct. 2006 til now, he's pretty much dropped off the face of the earth, doesn't respond to any calls or emails from anyone.  He lives with her now and so I can't see him either. <br>  <br>  Yea, I'm as confused as you are.|`|XxQVSzGiaa	When things like this happen, its best to just come out and ask her face-to-face. Handling things like this via email and chat end up with complications and misunderstandings. If she's really your friend, she'll speak whats on her mind.|`|8yA35MUXaa	You may smell bad...<br>  <br>  Or...it's just the internet and it really doesn't mean anything.|`|gmH1MPn1aa	Ask her. or just assume she doesn't like you ... either or works|`|gebIjqnWaa	Sounds like a plain  message to me. She's not your friend.

First of movies are always good. Sometimes me and some friends get really really bad movies just to laugh at how bad they were and quote them the next week at school in the halls. Try making homemade drinks(nonalcoholic). I love going into the kitchen with friends and coming up with Random drinks and daring people to drink it. Twister is also fun, girls like tht i think.. Anyway, have a good time with your friends! =D|`|cirdAuVfaa	keep allll the lights on, put on some loud music, keep talking, dive eachother makeovers, prank call ppl [: , sneak out, play games, just talk idk me and my friends usually have the best sleepovers but we dont plan anything it just happens. we stay awake by having pop and sh!t like that lol.  hope i helped

8XKmMBU7aa	Please only a stupid person forgive some one.<br>  He is your x and he is doing same thing again and again.<br>  don't you have mind please ?<br>  the only advise for you, please you also ignore him not for one or two days. you will ignore him forever or you will bow your head on his foot and will say him, please I can't live without you.<br>  please try to find nice person. who may understand you and can care you. He is a bastard dog. Sorry if i gave you any kind of heart.<br>  I'm not in your loss. Please try to be friend of God. He will help you and you are the best friend of yourself. <br>  <br>  have a nice day and nice dream.|`|it5i1K5Gaa	What ever it was that broke you up to begin with is still an issue.  This guy sounds like a loserand you can do much better.  I feel like you are leading him on by answering his texts with anything other than to leave you alone.  Both of you need to move on with your lives.
zG4QCxK7aa	just say exactly that and say that you know its hard to believe someone when they say that, but you will do anything to make them believe it! tell him you've changed and he's not that guy.|`|fBXRNKyuaa	Just tell him to trust you. Or you can show him you have changed and just give him time to think it over. If you both really like each other you will find away around this mess.
MRxm67DPaa	hun, heres the problem shes gonna feel left out and shell feel that u dont take her serously. i mean if u dont wanna have anythin holden u back then talk to her if u really feel somethine for this grul and take her serously then talk to her and ask her if she would like to come show her that ur really into her and that u care otherwise tell her u wanna go and even if u dont think its a good idea to take her to the party cuz shell feel akward then make her feel welcomed make her feel like she belongs at that party with the guys shes with and that u really care and demonstartate to her wat an awsome and careing person u can be by not blowing her off but instead talken to her about it and maken sure she feel like u really care about her.|`|2DKu5WzNaa	dancing is not sex you can do it if she gets made about it she is a weirdy|`|38376c3fed7d8b040a68d894fe4ce37aaa	Why are you thinking so much for so little thing. It is a fun to dance. Enjoy yourself in such things.|`|pEZr6MBHaa	Your girlfriend will feel bad if you go and dance with other girls.  I would ask her if she's okay with you going (though it's not entirely her call, knowing how she feels will help you make your decision.)  But why don't you just go to the party for a short while, hang out, but not dance with any other girls?  You can make an appearance and enjoy the party without dancing.  (And no, I don't think you can invite your girlfriend to the party if she wasn't invited.  If she wasn't invited, she wasn't invited.)|`|nHz1b2chaa	Well..you should talk to her, just incase. But if she blows up about it...then you need to tell her that she needs to cool it seriously. Girls shouldn't get that bitchy about it. Its just dancing just don't do anything stupid.|`|f5FmJRfIaa	It's just dancing with other girls, not making out with them, or asking them to marry you, or something.  Go to the party, and have a good time, you accepted this invite before you started dating this girl.  I suppose you could ask your friend if you could bring a date, if she's a good hostess she say that's fine, but as you said, this girl doesn't know any of your friends, it could get awkward for her.  In the future though, make opportunities for your girlfriend to get to know your other friends so she might be included in other things down the road... as for whether the girlfriend is ok with it, you've only been dating for a week, it's an invite you accepted before you started seeing her.  If she's got you that whipped after only a week, wow, are you ever in deep do do....|`|PHXFJeFpaa	You should talk to your girl friend about it even though you've only been going out for a little while.   If she's not ok with you dancing with other people try asking the other girl if your gf can come, if she can't just hang out with your gf.  Unless you don't like you gf then just go have fun and tell you gf you'll hang out another time.|`|w82en5ecaa	She'll feel bad! Its a new relationship. She'll hear about the party, if you danced with someone or not. You can dance like with other girls for fun or something and talk, but I really think you should ask her to bring your girlfriend.|`|7hgTANWuaa	I would talk to your girlfriend about it first. Then if she thinks its ok you should dance with who you want. Just don't do anything that would wreck your relationship.|`|useK8brnaa	just tell her.<br>  i wouldn't mind.<br>  just dont do any inappropriate dancing.
hpHaofpnaa	Don't do it! Girl, you'll just end up loseing a friend. Of course if he's worth it totally go for him.|`|veOZbaGPaa	its going to b awkward no matter which path u choose. Honesty is the best policy! why r u attracted to him,what good would come from u 2 being a couple,is he someone u can see yourself with, these r Qs u need 2 ask yourself also.  If like u say hes a jerk, hes like that 4 a reason,and u have 2 figure out if u want 2 deal with that on a regular basis. I would tell him the truth and see what comes of it. You allways have the choice 2 walk away.  Look at it this way; if u expressing your feelings ruins a friendship then they werent much of a friend anyway and youre probably better off.|`|fBXRNKyuaa	It sounds like you get mad of fun of. You said he likes to make people feel awkward and that he was ugly and a jerk. If you told him he would just make fun of you and nothing good would come out of the experience. <br>  <br>  Sorry if that's confusing.
fBXRNKyuaa	Just spend some time apart, after you've cooled off I'm sure things will be back to normal.|`|EKDnnFupaa	I know exactly what to do<br>  sleep with him repeatedly until your bored<br>  then leave again|`|zsMQyHuZaa	trick question i really don't  know .deeply find out in your heart why do you seem to hate your (ex)boyfriend .then question yourself do you really hate him.
73GkepzFaa	Sometimes the first feels like the only because they don't know what else is out there of sometimes insecurities come in and they don't think there is anyone else out there for them. They get stuck in it because they know that's there and are scared to let go and find something else, better. Best thing to do is not be friends with him. Don't talk to him much if possible and get on. When you get over him you can move on and find others. After seeing that there are more fishes in the sea then can you (or she) understand how friends with exs can work out and what to do and how to not get stuck in a relationship.|`|EKDnnFupaa	thanks for the 2 points<br>  your friends fail
gugI3nntaa	I do not think that you are doing anyhing wrong it seems to me that your friends are doing the wrong thing. If you like a guy your friends should not be flirting|`|gfzFtMFnaa	With friends like her you don't need any enemies.  Get my drift? <br>  <br>  You need new friends. She doesn't sound like a very good friend. <br>  <br>  Try to find guys on your own and don't share with her!|`|jcH8lJkjaa	don't tell her shawty.<br>  <br>  and wtf is the "Co-wink-e-dink"<br>  <br>  try to get with 1 guy and stop liking 20 different guys.<br>  <br>  or tell the girl to **** off your guys|`|EKDnnFupaa	STOP TELLING HER<br>  problems solved
AA11401784	The short answer is yes.<br>  <br>  In this case, there were several overwhelming factors in favor of allowing the new husband to adopt: <br>  <br>  First, your friend clearly abandoned the family, and clearly was making no attempt to be a father or father figure.<br>  <br>  Second, your friend's ex had custody of the child, and the child pretty much only knew its mother as a parent.<br>  <br>  Third, your friend was in flight to avoid prosecution, which would render him unfit to be a parent.<br>  <br>  Finally, if the new husband presented a stable father figure to the court, it's entirely possible that the court could have taken your friend's parental rights away and ordered adoption by the new husband.<br>  <br>  Your friend sounds like he has some serious responsibility issues.<br>  <br>  - Stuart|`|FewhKlx9aa	I don't know if this is you actually writing this story or what.I say she is trying to keep the kids grounded and away from the terrible past that the father was doing drugs.There seems to be a lot of bad things going on here and I would'nt want my kids involved in it either.You say he did'nt beat her but you all know what drugs can do to someone.If he wanted to pay child support he could of set something up with the courts in the childrens name so when they are 18 they are entitled to it.C'mon what are you trying to help this guy so bad,leave the x alone and get on with your lives.Probation and leaving the states sounds pretty bad to me/|`|wuLL7tG6aa	The answer is yes. And what Stuart said.<br>  <br>  Also it is possible to have adoption where the bio father does not agree. Many people are not aware of this legal fact.|`|7YTiooX5aa	He needs to contact a lawyer, the only way the new spouse could adopt the child is if she got your friend to sign over his rights or she would've lied and said that she has no idea where he is or how to get in contact with him and then after so long the courts will go ahead and let her do it.|`|IUw0f5u5aa	Get a very good lawyer.|`|ycNxVrUfaa	If he is the biological father he has a right to get to know his child. Ex his should be prosecuted for her outrageous behavior. Yes, I'm pissed. The same thing is happening to my son, although he gets visitation 10 hrs a week, my brother's ex wife took his kids too. I don't understand how women can be so selfish as to take their children's daddy away. <br>  Your friend needs to get a GOOD attorney and he also has to realize that this poor kid has been traumatized and most likely lied to his entire life. Encourage him and even if you can only give him time, be there for him.|`|7Sslop1Baa	Sounds like "Peanut Butter Jelly Time!!!"|`|GYqgHTdTaa	hmm possible|`|Uau0QkEeaa	fight for custody of the child(ren)

I know it's hard not getting along but just think of it as 1x every other month.You are with him all the other times.You say you have been married a long time so you should be use to it.|`|aXYiOskmaa	okay, you don't have a relationship with his family but HE does. what do you expect? he's not going to stop seeing his family because you don't like them|`|oRzqWhsDaa	You need to be happy that you are spared their company and you need to find something to do while he is gone even though he is gone every other month how many birthdays does this family have it sounds almost like he has chosen his family over you so you need to bond with yours when he is gone or get into church or social activties with the kids and life goes on I have been your shoes and I was grateful that he went and visited his family because I was never good enough but I dont care and I am  happy with my family and home life|`|0KLu4hRaaa	If I was in your situation then I would be relieved that he wasn't trying to force a relationship on me with his family. They treated you like poo and apparently don't care about your kids so let them sit and rot. Plain and simple who needs their freak show. Let them save their garbage for the Jerry Springer show. Tell your husband to have fun and then you and your kids go off on your own little adventure while he is kissing his families butt.|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	He does it because you allow him to. Sorry.<br>  <br>  Since he won't change- or stop- then I'd suggest you plan to do special things with your kids. Children are not stupid, and they understand a lot of things we don't give them credit for.<br>  <br>  It's his loss if he acts this way. Sounds to me like he is going to see another woman, not his family.|`|veZLfnGFaa	Is there a reason why he doesn't take you with him?  He should take you and you could stay somewhere else while he visits them.  This is so sad.|`|iTS8qJfoaa	I can't believe all the people on here trying to turn you against your husband.  You need to talk to him and resolve the issue, don't listen to the disgusting gossip, judgement and innuendo being thrown around on here about cheating etc. <br>  <br>  It is clear that he is doing this too often, every other month sounds a bit much - and still spending birthdays together sounds a bit childish - how long does he spend away?<br>  <br>  Let him know how you feel about it, and how it makes the kids feel.  Discuss a compromise where he spends perhaps one or two birthdays a year with them.  He needs to realise that his family now is your nuclear family with your kids, and that it is time to loosen the ties a little with his folks and siblings.  Try to get him to see this.  His duty is to you and your kids, perhaps if he starts to say no to his family a little they will recognise and understand this, and stop their ill feelings towards you if they see their son sticking by you and his kids.<br>  <br>  All the best.|`|ycNxVrUfaa	Why don't you make those times special for the children? When my (now ex) husband went out of town we would go to the movies, eat pancakes for dinner, make a little more noise than usual, stay up a bit later, ate more popcorn and generally enjoyed ourselves more because we had more freedom. We didn't have to cater to his every whim. I never verbalized this to my children but it was understood that when dad was gone, life was less stressful.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	Have you ever talked to oyur husband and told him how you feel? I would have a long talk with him and maybe even his family even though this may be very hard for you to do. They shouldn't treat the mother of their grandchildren this way, it is not right and just imagine what this is doing to the kids. I would be a better person then them and try to make it right.|`|lzooHi0Baa	That is what happens when you marry a mama's boy.  They are always hanging from their family's aprons and wife comes second.   You are at fault for having allowed it the first time.  The second time he would have done this, if it was me, he would have come back to an empty house.|`|8RLGcshUaa	Why doesn't he take you?? Is he embarassed? That's bull. If you want to go you should have the option of going. Don't be devestated, kick your husband in his butt!|`|djUMvICoaa	Birthdays every other month?  How convenient.|`|MjSLQlIHaa	thats vey strange! ever think he might be creepin around with some ole s@ut! do some investigating on his sorry behind i would, and find out whats really going on.|`|IRlVBGWOaa	The best resolution to this problem (especially for your kids' sake) is to mend relations with your husband's family.  Go with your husband for one of his visits and try to re-establish communication with his family. If that doesn't work, then you shouldn't keep your kids from going on the monthly family visits with him.  Sometimes you have to set aside your pride for the sake of your children.  Its going to be difficult, but that is whats best.  And you can't get angry with your husband for visiting his family.  Family is family.....period.  You can't expect him to give up his loved ones for you.  There needs to be balance and you must learn to accept that.  Hope this helps!|`|DWgyWFNyaa	y do u let a man put u and ur child down so bad  u guys r family u guys need to be there 4 one another he needs to reailze that ur kids see everything no matter the age there gana grow up wondering y dad never defended u and if he really loved u and ur kids he wood not go 2 the place where they disrespet u a man is suppost to defend this family no matter how it is|`|2HznXhPcaa	maybe you can visit your friends or your family when your husband goes away.   sweet mildred sent me here to help you out.|`|Uau0QkEeaa	ask him is he hiding somthing from u ask him does he want to protect u or hurt u ask him does he care about the family that hes made with u ask him he really going to his family house      ask him is he cheating on u if not just ask him can u and ur bkids com 2|`|3zG0HJxSaa	o thats sad if they treat u like that cut them off
mpgpImZyaa	The guy I like is two grades ahead of me, it makes it kind of hard.<br>  Because he may think its weird to date someone younger it just depends.<br>  It would defiantly help if you talked to him, the best way to get him to notice you is to talk to him.<br>  A lot of guys like it when you make the first move, so if you see him in the library comment on the book he is looking at, or just other things like that. You cant get anywhere if you don't talk to him.<br>  Me and the guy I like talk almost everyday, so my situation is different from yours. But really the best thing you can do is talk to him. I don't really know what else to tell you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|hnFFodXgaa	Well as a guy, I find confrotation the most effective in getting attention, If you have lunch with him ask if he minds you sitting next to him, not when his friends are around because its impossible to have a convo while he's joking around. As a gf sometimes looking pretty is just being yourself, If he ends up liking you most likely he wont care about how you dress, just you. And just ask the person out, being nervous might ruin any chance you may have.

8eCyY7RCaa	Tell them you love them!|`|9a1222c76592e0b48ac15195740a43d9aa	well, you have to observed them..sometimes they would rather be leave alone than be bother (how did I know that, huh, a lot of previous experience of try to cheer ppl in the wrong time with wrong way).<br>  <br>  you need to first <br>  <br>  1. Observed if they can be bother.<br>  2. See what will cheer them up.<br>  ex. a cake, or a moive or a flower.<br>  3. then do it. but be prepared people doesn't always appreicated it, so just do it because you cared about them. If it was a wrong time, wrong thing or wrong person, at least you have a caring heart and you cared about the people.<br>  <br>  I did it many time in my life and will still try but just learned that don't let it stop your passion/caring. <br>  <br>  smile, chen|`|SsfnitjXaa	If you being in his life isn't already making him feel better then I have to say you shouldn't be worrying about it.|`|BgZA7lvQaa	Give them alot of money.

And doesn't look like you are either.<br>  <br>  Dump the guy.  Get you a job and work and find someone worthy to be with.  And don't have babies with someone who is addicted.

w8Fdk02maa	Both of them are jerks and are backstabbing you. That is life my friend. People are jerks and you need to find some new friends... and a new boyfriend. It sucks I know, it hurts I know. I've been there... I've even been the friend that my friends girlfriend started liking and almost ruined the friendship... but you know what? I chose my friend over the girl and things worked out so good. Remember to always do whats right. For you in the situation, you are not at fault, but remind your friend that if she really is your friend, she will leave your boyfriend alone even AFTER you dump him... which you should. Sorry to say it but you should.<br>  <br>  You deserve a guy who won't go behind your back.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER!!! If he owns up to his mistake and you ask him to tell you how he would feel if he started texting someone on your phone and ended up secretly liking one of HIS friends and his friend liked you back how would he feel about it!!!<br>  <br>  I'm sure he'll realize that it was wrong to do and either apologize or get defensive... you can make your decision on whether or not to stay with him on his reaction<br>  <br>  If he gets defensive and tells you that he WOULDNT CARE if that happened then he needs to be dumped in that second.<br>  <br>  if he gets apologetic and realizes his wrongs then you may want to give him another chance and ask your friend to respect your boundaries.<br>  <br>  Your choice though, I hope things work out.|`|8f7484cd58d5ae1f35f8ec33cbe9d727aa	Dear Bitter,<br>  <br>  One of Life's hardest lessons to learn is that we cannot make someone love us.  You don't give your age, but you sound young.  It's good you learn this lesson early.  When situations like this happen, you should not waste your time wondering what you should do, but you should decide if your "friend" is worth keeping.  It sounds as though she is out for herself and has forgotten your friendship.  Therefore, find a new friend.  <br>  <br>  Tell the boyfriend that you've changed your mind and don't feel that he is trustworthy, so he can take a hike.  Be polite, but firm.  <br>  <br>  Some have advised you to "punch" the other girl.  Do not.  Any physical contact of that type can hurt you and make you look as if you cannot control your emotions.  You don't want that type of reputation.  <br>  <br>  Good luck, Sweetie.  The Right One will show up at the right time.|`|2Y9U5jlGaa	Definitely dump him and find some one who really cares for you.

I would be angry at my friend and boyfriend if they were already making out and stuff behind my back....but I would probably ditch the boyfriend and the friend for a while well at least till i have moved on because it may be hard and everything...also if your bf has liking another person just let him go you can't hold him down...you just have to see if he likes you enough not to go around falling for other girls but you can't really blame someone for falling for someone else...it happens all the time....this is real confusing but i would let the bf go he is obviously not committed to your relationship anymore...|`|YyWtVDjJaa	If he is telling you this then you need  to get rid of him.

Sounds like there are more than a few problems there. <br>  <br>  Not only that, if he has a job where he has to drive or travel, what if he gets a ticket?

AA11608181	An annulment states that for some reason, the marriage never took place.  This means that there had to have been something at the time of the wedding that kept there from being a complete union between two people.<br>  <br>  <br>  For example, a marriage might be annulled if:<br>  <br>  1. At least one partner didn't fully and freely consent.<br>  2. Someone wasn't mature enough to understand the full extent of what they were doing.<br>  3. There was never intent to be faithful.<br>  4. One or both partners did not intend to be open to children (this indicates a lack of understanding about the sacrament of marriage).<br>  5. At least one partner was a baptized Catholic, but the marriage was not performed according to canonical form (by a Catholic priest, in a church).<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  As for cost, although there is sometimes a charge, it's meant to cover expenses.  This is not a money-making scheme.  Most commonly, there are the basic petition fees payable to the tribunal.  In the U.S., most tribunals charge anywhere from $200 to $1,000 for adjudicating a standard nullity case. A few charge somewhat over $1,000, and several charge nothing at all. The fee for "documentary cases" (where a Catholic party violated canonical form when attempting to marry) is usually much less, around $25.|`|AA11785285	The Church rather turns a blind eye toward divorce...

Therefore a true friend will put aside everything else and come over to give you a helping hand in whatever you need. <br>  <br>  A true friend is always on your side even though you are losing--<br>  <br>  The ultimate test to verify if someone is a true friend is when you are going through difficult times. When you have money and you offer drinks on the house, everyone smiles and says that you are a great person. But when you’re broke or down, not everybody will stand by you to listen to what you have to say. Only true friends will stay. <br>  <br>  A true friend gives without waiting for something back--<br>  <br>  Friendship is give and take but it does not necessarily happen in a sequential manner. A true friend is ready to give a lot before asking for something back. <br>  <br>  A true friend respects your opinion--<br>  <br>  Even though you don’t agree with your friend about something, s/he will still respect your ideas and agrees that you don’t agree on that particular point. A true friend values your friendship more than the topics that you don’t agree on. <br>  <br>  True friendship is shown through small things--<br>  <br>  A true friend shows that s/he cares by giving attention to small things like remembering what times of your life are special and important to you...things that are dear to you and have special meaning.<br>  <a href="http://blog.fruitfultime.com/2008/02/08/definetrue-friends/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.fruitfultime.com/2008/02/08/...</a><br>  <br>  I've learned a lot in my life about people and who is and is not a genuine friend.

What were you doing prying into his emails anyway.  You sound really young.  If he had his thing inside you and you didn't even know you were having sex, then you are way too young.

You should get tested.|`|bEahxLcFaa	okay i have a few questions for u.... 1st of all how is he gay if almost proposed to you? and 2nd... how did his "thing" go inside of you if u didnt have sex??? well i advise u to be tested for STDs... i hope u the best ? u might want to fix up ur question a little by the way... its a little confusing|`|lWGaYxAbaa	BEFORE U DO ANYTHING ASK HIM IF HES GAY MAKE SURE!!<br>  <br>  Maybe he just wants 2 have a normal life and doesn't want 2 be gay<br>  thats very common. let him purpose get that idea out of ur head it doesnt change a thing trust me hes still a good man and would probably be a good father

n9y5ydnVaa	Neither... i think she doesn't understand what it means to you to see your mom alone before a two week trip. I would nicely tell her that it is really important to you to see your mom before the trip. Ask her if it okay that you do something with her next weekend or after she gets back. She may be acting like that because she isn't as attached to her mom as you are or just doesn't understand what it is like to have her mom there for her a lot and then leave for two weeks.

If you explained to her that you wanted to spend time with your mom and she was offended by that, she was not being a good friend. If she wants to be a good friend, she should be more understanding of your feelings and know that just because you do not want to spend time with her tonight does not mean you do not want to be her friend.

If she's a true friend, she'll get over not being able to do what she pleases with you and you'll just continue being friends even though you said no this time.  She can come over some other time when it's more convenient and when you want her there, just not tonight.  If she ges offended or hurt, then she has a problem.  You said "no" (even said it nicely) and you meant no so just leave it like that.  Your friend will just have to learn to accept no once in a while and get on with her life.  You should focus on enjoying your mom's company right now before she leaves on trip.|`|ojwRgCLqaa	Tell her sorry but maybe some other time. You already have plans. No your not being mean.

That's the highlight of my day|`|38376c3fed7d8b040a68d894fe4ce37aaa	May be, depends upon the mood.|`|I1XIi8syaa	Yes|`|28667a2fab4e406f52bfe94a34c859cbaa	depends on the mood|`|W6Lj6Kqiaa	yes its the first thing that goes through my mind when i leave work

cdQryr7paa	Feel free to do that.<br>  Tell him his penis is WAY smaller than mine.<br>  I'll go along with it.|`|VAI6MtPIaa	Never. <br>  <br>  It shows lack of compassion and that he is wanting for something he doesn't have. You need to tell him that you don't like it and he needs to stop comparing you to other people. You are NOT them, you never want to be them so he needs to stop. <br>  <br>  I'd be pissed if my husband was comparing me to my younger sister or anyone in my family.|`|yhEDUN6qaa	Two wrongs don't make a right. Don't insult him back. You need to just tell him how it makes you feel when he compares you to other women in a demeaning way. Give him precise examples (like when he said her hair looked better than yours) because sometimes men are clueless and don't realize what they're saying hurts.|`|ByUS0k8waa	Nope I think I would just slap him. Plus people say things about me and my sister all the time because we look totally opposite. She is blonde hair blue eyes and Im brown hair and green eyes. My husband would never say anything like that but if he did I would probably make a some kind of dig back at him. Probably compare him to one of his brothers. He would hate that.|`|UGDMYh0Kaa	If my husband was that much of an asshole, 1) he probably wouldn't be my husband after a while 2) probably wouldnt have been my husband to begin with 3) hell yes I would compare him to another man in a bad way!<br>  "oh wow i saw this ripped guy at the gym *look at ur husbands chest, look at his face* well babe, not everyone can look that good I guess"<br>  Or Id say "speaking of hair, you should do something about yours"|`|20ee7f2aadb248558085cabc8d4743ccaa	This question again. How many ways are you going to ask this. Instead of talking to him and working it out, you want people to agree with you to act the same way. <br>  M|`|KZlgdMeEaa	hes an inconsiderated boob and may just b making suggestions the best way he knows how that hed like u to get a new hairstyle|`|d1TTwwUUaa	No I have a great husband. Evidently you don't. He has a thing for your SIS  Sorry|`|09k5GLLkaa	That's just silly|`|0bYcYz2jaa	I would be super pissed.  First of all, why is he looking at my younger sister's attractiveness?  Second, you married me so why are you going to belittle your own choice?  And third, why are you trying to hurt my feelings you jackass?  Saying you like her hairdo is one thing, so is suggesting that it might look good on me.  But to just say that she's better than me?  You are in for a rough, possibly short marriage if your husband doesn't care how you feel being compared to others, sister or not.  Maybe I would say, Oh I like your brother's/friend's/cousin's hair or style or personality just to show him what it feels like!  That's super insensitive of him!<br>  <br>  EDIT:  if you want to be mature about it then talk it out with him.  you are married, you should be able to communicate with each other and let him know it bothers you.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Sure if you want him to know how it feels. Next time he makes a comment like that, ask him why he doesn't have 6-pack abs like some other guy you know. Or why his hair is now thinning when it used to be so full. Or that he needs to buy some dye to cover the gray hairs you can see
JH6oCuUZaa	I feel sorry for you....just hearing teenage girls talk about that movie is annoying and I cant imagine how it would feel to live with it.....in this case suicide may be an option....nobody would blame you.|`|9zM6QFEOaa	there is a fee ways to handle this so all you have to do is pick the one  you think you can live with.<br>  1) wait for it to become old news. wich will happen in a couple of years , cuz there might be a sequel or part two.<br>  <br>  2)make fun and jokes about the guy and the character, not your wife just the actor and the charator. this will make your wife a little upset, but she will stop talking about him when you are around, and maybe even stop liking him.<br>  <br>  3)pick a female actress, and start acting the smae way about her but get a little bit more crazy about her than your wife is about her fantasy lover. this should make your wife kinndda anoyed, and she will stop if you will stop.<br>  <br>  4)grab all the stuff with his name on it and thow it away, then get ready for war, and hide all your good stuff cuz she will thow it away too.|`|OAh9TDlDaa	LMAO...I can't believe you even posted this. What doesit hurt for her to be into something?? And why are you too cheap to buy her the movie? When i love a movie, i just buy it. I won't be cutting out pics of the stars and hanging themonmy wall, but i did buy all the Harry Potter books and movies. Why can't you just leave her be? Is she forcing you to talk about it? I don't think so, so just move on and do your own thing. You said you spend a fair amount of time on your Xbox...Well, that seems borish to me and childish. Everyone has thir own thing.|`|krQiDGCHaa	LOL my friend is the same way.<br>  <br>  I read the books too, and I LOVED them.  Immediately after reading the books, my best friend and I went to see the movie.<br>  <br>  I was completely wrapped up in the sweet love story, and I'm still touched by it and I love how sweet Edward is to Bella.  <br>  <br>  I am *not* obsessed with it.  I enjoyed the books, I enjoyed the movie, and I will enjoy watching the other movies as they come out.<br>  <br>  My friend is JUST as obsessed as your wife.  She's starting to drive me nuts and I don't even have to live with her!  She talks about it *all* the time, and it's crazy!<br>  <br>  No, you're not ridiculous to feel that way.  I totally sympathize with you!|`|TlqUvFhVaa	trust me it will pass<br>  i was obsessed with twilight to like all i did was talk about it,spend all night watching interviews of rob pattinson,reading all the books  non stop without any sleep,finding any article,or picture of rob pattinson and taping it to my wall ,rewatching twilight the movie 100 times. ya but that was so 2 months ago . i mean once new moon the movie comes out i will be obsessed all over again but thats a whole year so.<br>  btw im 15 =]|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	It's not actually the Twilight thing, it's the vampire thing.  Go buy her the books "Interview with the Vampire", "The Vampire Lestat", and "Queen of the Damned"<br>  <br>  Bite her on the neck the next time you're feeling frisky.|`|B12E4rYiaa	It's not ridiculous but you cannot change it only she can. It might be best for you to do something else or ignore this faze she's going through we all do this with one thing or another at some point in our lives. I agree it's an immature thing, but maybe it helps her to get out of reality for awhile and relieves stress. <br>  <br>  Whatever the case I believe it will pass so do your best to not focus on her obsession and get busy with something you enjoy.
IHw2qUtcaa	Let her make her own decisions darlin'.
7WomqDuEaa	i was in your position before. my friend wasn't raped but she got pregnant at 15 and the guy she was seeing at the time wasn't serious. anyway i can see that you wanna be a good friend, but ultimately the decision isn't up to you. you should just talk to her and let her know there are some options besides abortion, like an open adoption, where she will be able to keep in contact with the child. I hope this helped you. Good Luck :]
3sSYxWN0aa	She can't stay out of school for much longer. Either she has no idea how to rate things in terms of value or there's something truly wrong besides your phone, because unless your phone cost more than 1 grand it isn't worth skipping school just to avoid you.<br>  <br>  Just wait it out. if she stays out of school much longer then she will be left back. Once she goes back to school then confront her about it. Until then I would keep trying to call her, and maybe get her parents involved instead of yours.<br>  <br>  If this goes on too long then I would just start being a complete *** and call her non stop in the middle of the night.|`|nfSAAz7Zaa	Dont get violent just wait another 2 days and if it gets bad, then tell someone like a teacher , teachers should be there to help, but violence will just lead to suspention, and looking dumb in front of your parents.|`|lafl6ZKZaa	Umm... Offer money. then fi She Does Give It Back dont give the money. take the phone and say thanks if she gets violent there we go. but its prolly best to go to your parents and try to say she took it.|`|MDYWlYw0aa	call ur network and have them disconnect your phone so ur friend cant text or call any1|`|JiOhZ0Bgaa	go to her house?<br>  <br>  <br>  and like go and get it|`|sIpWVCItaa	go to her house|`|vD0Nkjvfaa	go over to her house and tell her you want it back NOW|`|VRMIwqQFaa	Ok my friend brianna did this one time, and she had to get her parents involved with it and her parents were just thankful that she got her phone back. i will give this to you straight up, you should not give out your phone to anyone unless they are your parents. and i can see why you don't want to get your parents involved with this. is there anyone that you really trust in your family? are they willing to help you? if they are ask them and see if they can help you get back your phone. or else the number one thing to do is go to that friend house and with that parent or family member that you trust you should ask for your phone back. it is not  a violent way. and if you want her to tell you why you have not seen her at school ask her. Or maybe you can contact her parents and tell them that there daughter has your phone. and that is all the ways that i think are best to get back your phone if you don't want to be violent. i help my friend brianna and she got her phone back the very next day. and once you get your phone back from her you never have to tell your parent what happened.But if she called people on your phone and it went on your phone bill then you have to explain to your parents what happened. it is not every good to keep thinks like that away form your parent and i wish you the BEST of luck!!!!!!!|`|rNyun3hbaa	If you know where she lives i would first suggest going to her house and seeing if she has it. If not, then you are going to have to either get your parents or the school involved. I don't suggest getting violence because that is when things get really bad and mae things worse. So i think you should get your parents involved. even if you just tell them you accidentally put it in her backpack instead of yours and now she hasn't been to school and you don't know what to do. <br>  Good luck!|`|XxQVSzGiaa	Go to her house and get the phone. Talk to the girl's parents when your there. DON'T get violent; the last thing you wanna do is possible get the police involved (which would also involve your parents).If you let her borrow the phone the battery is probably dead too, which would explain her not answering the cell phone. or maybe she broke it...<br>  then you need to involve your parents.|`|YOzx6vNSaa	well maybe shes just ill. or maybe you need to go to her house and ask her about it. maybe shes lost it?<br>  if she doesnt let you have it back get HER parents involved, then she will have no choice. but if she doesnt give it her back then your going to have to tell someone so you can get a new phone or a replacement, or just report it stolen and you could most likely get a replacement free.<br>  <br>  good luck.|`|kr34vLJkaa	File a police report?  She gave her the phone.<br>  Go to her house?  That's trespassing.<br>  Confront her?  That is assault.<br>  Touch her? That is battery.<br>  Don't tell parents.  That is stupid.<br>  Only option is to have the phone shut off.  That is smart.|`|KZ1IbLQPaa	I say confront her the next time you see her. Ask her why she hasn't given your phone back. If she doesn't have a good reason and doesn't give it back you SHOULD involve a trusted adult into the situation or maybe tell her mother about the situation.|`|ac8fe1Jbaa	you should go to her house first, ask for it back.<br>  then if nothing... threaten her that you will call the police (Usually this works)<br>  then if nothing....tell your parents or actually call the police or her parents<br>  nothing again? BEAT THE LIVING CRAP OUT OF HER!!!!|`|3635359c200983593a83844b9f4a76bbaa	you should tell your parents.. i mean they can work some magic.<br>  if she stole it i wouldnt call her a friend. maybe something happened and she moved? lol i dont know. its a confusing situation. <br>  lol|`|MA9h4sWyaa	Go to her house and demand it back or your calling the cops and if that doesn't work get her parents not yours! to make her  to give it back!!!|`|mjGlEGAbaa	You should go to her house and give her thearts to tell her parents if she  agree its ok otherwise you have to tell your parents.|`|Eg1A8IMraa	Wait for her to come to school. If she doesn't, then call her at home, not on the cell. Talk to her parents.|`|53pargZ3aa	Call her house and see if her parents pick up<br>  If they bring up just be like "Hey is.... there? She borrowed my phone like over a week ago and I really need it back!"|`|OmBN4RwBaa	have you tried calling her parents or e-mailing her if not you should|`|azFelYaZaa	tell that little girl off if she has her own phone what buisness does she have taking yours|`|5YI6rBdOaa	Go to her house and get it.|`|JrcmZzdLaa	tell her parents?|`|ybuk2DWlaa	dont jump to conclusions.. she might be sick or something?|`|Ng2SIh7baa	Don't get violent! Find her, if you let her borrow your phone you must know something about her.|`|8BlsO3ncaa	There is never a point at which you need to get violent. Just write it off to experience.|`|wVTbjsVDaa	do u know her address? go find her, or ask police for help.|`|1uvrkDWNaa	File a police report for theft.|`|26DoxkOBaa	Find out where she lives and go over there to see what's going on.|`|Xxt4pEyEaa	Go to her house. Tell her your parents are so p.o.ed that they told me to get it back or else they are calling the police. Blame it off mom and dad. I'm sure they wouldn't care IF they knew. Hopefully, that'll make the return. Next, talk to her mom. Once, a so called friend used my bike. She had it for over a month. I finally had to steal it back. She never mentioned it was even missing! ha.|`|ZF7DwNCmaa	Call her parents, tell them you need to talk to her. You really need to get your parents involved, it's the right thing to do.  Do you know were she lives? Talk to her in person.|`|hZjPYyFTaa	You might have to suck it up. Learn a life lesson and move on. You did call the phone company I hope - that's the first thing to do. Can you not lie and say you lost your phone?|`|ZOPf2Ut1aa	get it
HAHA2u13aa	Yes,the girl and I remained friends however our relationship was never the same,wish now that I would had said"take him","no problem!".As for him,he moved on to break more hearts.Happy to hear your situation had a "Happy Ending"!Peace|`|avVdKiWKaa	Yeah, actually a similar situation happened to me too one time.  We all have different lives now but we're still all friends.|`|zG4QCxK7aa	yes... but i let my friend have him... and now hes gna break up with her:/|`|Ot2jBr17aa	there was this guy that me and my friend liked. he was really hot. but he liked me not her. so he asked me out and i said yes. My friend was mad but got over it and were still tight best friends, and the guy is my boyfriend of almost 6 months. so it all worked out for me|`|MA9h4sWyaa	Yes, It has almost the same situation except me and my friend were at the movies!!!
e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	be there for your brother the best u can be.<br>  If U need a friend I'm here.<br>  Take Care|`|89lEF1bwaa	sneak him out =]
w9W3wPCOaa	if it hapened to me, i would still be her friend. but i next time she would invite me i would go and if i couldent then i wouldent.  and i wouldent be counting on her to come. if she comes good, if she dosent well too bad.<br>  <br>  idk hard to say.|`|03GQ637Raa	i would go on out and have a good time, you might meet someone who deserves to spend time with you.|`|BE2vknbHaa	If there is a valid reason why she had to cancel at last minute like that then don't take so hard. If she just did it for no reason whatsoever talk to her about it and tell her that you canceled all your plans to go to the movies with her and that you don't like being ditched.|`|4fnu8XeWaa	well if her reason was strong enough you don't have to act like its the end of the world!! cheer up!!  :)<br>  but is she said a silly reason to you be mad for some days.. he he (that's how i was gonna act)|`|baQn3MuYaa	Ive had something like that -.-<br>  i was meant to be going out with a friend but then i kinda dumped her to go out without someone else <br>  i feel awlful :(|`|AA11376151	that would be stupid to not talk to her again <br>  just hang our w/ her another time and obviously this teaches you not to let a girl control your life cuz u turn out feeln like this
ByUS0k8waa	I think its scares them away because they think its better to be all macho. They cant let down their guard as easy as women can. Its hard for them to open up and its easier to run away then to stay and be vulnerable to being hurt. Its how they protect themselves. Nothing wrong with being vulnerable just have to be careful who you show that to. Only share if they are willing to share.|`|4F8b4D6Laa	She can think about it, let her emotions go and see where she failed to realize that man cared not for her, so she won't make the same mistake.<br>  <br>  Next time it'll be more difficult, but not impossible, to get attached again.<br>  <br>  Because they rather to have a relationship with someone that can reasonably copy with their own emotions, it's never nice to preview that you'll have to be all careful about what you say or do all the time otherwise the person will be hurt.|`|Z9jlS2bUaa	don't share strong emotions too early. If he keeps up this kind of behavior, get rid of him.. you're better off w/o someone who will kick you when you're down.|`|Lyrc2BWmaa	becuase all men are jerks and think with their dick instead of their heart.<br>  <br>  Emotions scare them because its a step closer to commitment.|`|FaPF439Kaa	I will try to answer this, although each of us is an individual, we are all different.  The reason we see some things as our deepest darkest secrets is that they have not been talked about with another. The sharing of them frequently sheds a new light on our attitude about it. I don't do well with someone elses secrets. I don't know what to say in that; I may not see their secret as being something to hide.|`|4SHr6i55aa	YOU HAVE THE CONCEPT INCORRECT. VULNERABLE IS WHEN YOU ARE ALREADY WEAK AND SOMEONE TAKES ADVANTAGE OF THAT WEAKNESS. PEOPLE NEED TO READ A DICTIONARY (NOT YOU). IF SOMEONE OPENS THERE HEART; OUT COME THE PERSONS WEAKNESS AND STRENGTHS. WHATEVER WEAKNESS THEY HAVE, THE OTHER PERSON WILL USE TO THEIR ADVANTAGE. WHY ARE PEOPLE LIKE THIS? WHO KNOWS.|`|MjSLQlIHaa	men are only interested in whats between a woman's legs, and they dont want to be vulnerable lol well their not wired to i guess theyre just pumping machines lol thats it.|`|09k5GLLkaa	Who says that it's weak and wrong? Women have feelings that differ from most men and life goes on.|`|kTUL01tfaa	they figure they are there for sex, not to be your analyst. why do you think magazines like playboy are so popular, men don't care what's going on in those girl's minds, they only care about how she makes them feel.|`|ngsbRZENaa	Men are robots. Emotion is a program we can't comprehend.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	When you go through the process of getting to know someone, you continue to make choices as to trust and how much personal information you are willing to disclose. (Read up on self disclosure). In it's simplest form, when you love someone, you make yourself open and vulnerable. Contrary to some opinions, this is not gender related. It is human related.<br>  <br>  Some men may see this as a weakness, and that can scare them off. Men don't usually like being open and vulnerable, but the more mature person will open their heart, to the right 'other person' through the process of self disclosure.<br>  <br>  We all take risks at finding love, when we get hurt, emotionally, we think it's terrible, but the fact is, it's an opportunity to learn and to grow as a person. We take these risks because at the end of the day, we just might find ourselves in a genuinely meaningful and fulfilling relationship.|`|wzqahEqiaa	I've known this guy for over 10 years and he is around the same age as my dad. He works in the back room at his job and he's very shy. He has always come out of the back room and talked to me over the years. He respects the fact that I can also be quite and reserved. It's taken many years but he's really opened up and become comfortable around me. His boss is surprised that we have such a nice friendship.<br>  <br>  There was another guy around at one point who was a jerk. The jerk tried to interfere in my friendship with the shy man. I had an opportunity to defend my friend against the guy who was a jerk. I know it had a deep impact on my friend that I defended him.<br>  <br>  Sometimes you need to defend your friends even if it's difficult otherwise relationships will be ruined. It's very hard to trust someone knowing they won't defend your friendship if necessary.<br>  <br>  People can be guarded for various reasons. It can take time (even years) to trust someone. Many people judge new circumstances based on past experiences. It's sad because innocent people can get judged for mistakes someone else made. Being shy or vulnerable isn't a bad thing. Some people don't want a long lasting friendship or commitment. If they don't want someone around long term it's easier not to get emotionally involved or be vulnerable.
6gK5dzTdaa	Yes, unfortunately this is normal to a degree.  However, your sister seems a little more dependent than what she needs to be.  She also seems to crave attention more than what she needs to be.<br>  <br>  Next time you go to the store with her or where ever it may be, tell her from the start, that if she has to go when there, it is up to her to ask.  Tell her that she is old enough to ask politely and she is fully capable of doing so.  Tell her that if she throws a fit in public like a baby then she will be treated like one by not allowing her to tag along with you in the future until she is able to act her age.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	yep, she's normal.
1Z0Lmrk1aa	I seriously doubt that anyone who was sexually molested won't have any issues. I am a survivor and without going into to much detail i can tell you it made me a much more perverted and sexual being.|`|tao83sDxaa	i was molested in 2nd grade, i have carried it with me for 50 years. no- one is not effected in some way. you just learn to live with the hurt. everyone deals with it in different ways, but it is always there.|`|Hizsm6m4aa	No not everyone is affected. Not everyone has horrible memories, some are even able to block it out enough to move on and never think about it. I think it depends on the level, age, person involved, and duration of the episode. Some people are also very strong minded and able to make sense of what happened, not blame themselves, and are lucky enough to not have that person around them throughout the rest of their life.|`|0011Smdtaa	Even if the person believes they haven't been affected there will be triggers...  They may cruise through life till they have their own children and suddenly be left trying to deal with the mess created by someone else...  Something on tv may make them aware of what they are hiding.....  I personally believe even if you never tell anyone or convince yourself you can deal with this and haven't been affected in anyway - you still have been affected.  The molestation has touched your very soul and it will be carried for life....  Unfortunately we live in a world where children are not always kept safe from peodophiles....|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	a person will be effected for the rest of there life
H8WqMK1eaa	No, that's just dumb.<br>  <br>  If you don't want your kids texting and taking photos with their cellphone, then don't give them camera-phones with texting capability.|`|OHfZFR31aa	If they are under 18 they should not be tried as adults in the first place. But they should be punished in some way. A 16 year old should not be sending naked pictures of anyone - you never know where they are going to end up. If they are texting to friends, these friends may text to other people, and the picture could end up on some underage porn site<br>  <br>  My friend's son was 18 and in high school when he was caught having sex with his 15 year old girlfriend of 2 years, and he is also considered a child sex offender and has to register as such for the rest of his life.|`|1239271c3de85dde812326b9aaafb7d8aa	i see that as big brother, uncle sam, govt sticking their nose in places where it don't belong.  If its considered a problem, then it would be a moral issue that should be handled between the "offending" families!<br>  Any criminal proceedings should be considered frivolous and a huge waste of the legal systems resources.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	I don't think they should be charged with a felony, no.  I don't think they should be charged with anything at all.  I think this should fall under freedom of speech.|`|0PdYYeBFaa	I agree with you..it is ridiculous|`|yhEDUN6qaa	I don't think they should be charged with child pornography if neither is even considered an adult. They're both children! However, I don't think kids should be taking pictures of themselves naked in the first place. It can be a big problem if the pictures get into the hands of a REAL sex offender or the recipient never deletes the pictures. <br>  <br>  There should be some sort of punishment to be handled by the parent. If they can't be responsible with their cell phones it's up to the parent to punish them not the law. It's petty and the government and police force have A LOT bigger issues to tackle than teens making bad choices involving their phones.<br>  <br>  If I found out my kid was doing this, they would not have a phone until they are 18 years old or not living with me.|`|nBa2euH4aa	Yes they should get into trouble. A felony is to harsh though unless the sexting ends in someones death. It can be very dangerous emotionally, socially, and know good comes from it. There is a reason and purpose for modesty and for sex.<br>  Make it a big deal, because it is.|`|th7C1aoaaa	I agree. If they are sending them willing , also. I don't see the need for the felony. It's not like someone is sending pics of someone else to adults.|`|QVjagGXPaa	I think the whole thing is unnecessary. <br>  Teens sending nude pictures of themselves just makes them look slutty. (or manwhorish, a new word, yes?)|`|BE2vknbHaa	They shouldn't be charged with a felony but they should be reprimanded by law in another way.|`|532XA7lkaa	It's called child pornography and yes it should be considered a felony.|`|TlqUvFhVaa	theres nothing wrong with it if its teens sending naked pics to other teens but if its grown men/woman with naked pics of teens in there text messages then thats wrong|`|kTUL01tfaa	teenagers are a bunch of whores today, and whore mongers. throw them all in prison and straighten their asses out.|`|djUMvICoaa	It seems that you are walking a fine line here aren't you?  So you don't think it's wrong for a 16 y.o. to send nude pics to another 16 y.o. so what do you do if the one who received those pictures shows them to an adult or posts them on the net?  Does anybody get charged here, why or why not?  I just can't imagine any 16 y.o. having to text nude pics to anyone, for what reason?  If the only way she can get attention is to send nudes then she needs help and fast.  She can't have any self esteem or hasn't been taught healthy boundaries about her body.  While a  felony may be a little harsh, if that's what the law says then that's the way the law has to be followed.  If you don't like the law then you fight to change  the law.|`|94c983eed26f9fffeb52827bce2a933baa	I think that the law should confiscate the cell phone and release the photo to the parents. I also think that the teenager should be fined that way he or she will never forget it and grow up at the same time.
iFz6SP7paa	Don't make friends online, you never know who they are. Just try to make friends at school maybe join some clubs after school and things. Soon youl have more friends than you know what to do with. Then you can make plans to go to the cinema or have friends round at the weekend.<br>  <br>  hope this helped xxxxx|`|oLZv1QUmaa	you can have  a cool party maybe that can help|`|AzcfZ12kaa	Don't go online,it's better to meet ppl in real llife,like joining a club or activity|`|1kIP1q71aa	do you go to school? make friends at school! not online, it's dangerous and jsut not worth it. join after school activities, clubs, or meet some friends through other friends or family members. there's always people to meet out there, sometimes you just have to look. :) good luck. :)|`|hN60MJHlaa	Don't make friends online.  Tell your parents how you're feeling and have them sign you up for some kind of activity you're interested in...tennis, art, etc.  <br>  <br>  You'll make friends in your new class.
fwZPEqwMaa	With people like that<br>  i find new friends worthy to be friend with<br>  hang out with them and only talk to girls<br>  like "lissa" at school.<br>  <br>  The thing is my friends don't know i don't<br>  like girls like "lissa" so they'll talk about <br>  things we've done right in front of her and<br>  then she feels jealous. She made it kinda <br>  obvious<br>  <br>  But i'd never be anything more than acquaintance<br>  with her.  Just say "hi" and that small talk<br>  <br>  i hope i answered ur question<br>  i'll edit if i didnt|`|AjPbtm7oaa	I was all like, does she spell better than you?
y4SUDnpaaa	I agree with most of what your friend says, except for people who for people who have been dating for 2 - 3 years should just get married. Just because a couple has been together a long time doesn't mean it's been a stable or compatible time. I also think getting married just because you've gotten pregnant is not a good thing. Not because I am in favor of single parents but because it is mostly two people having causal sex without protection. The innocent child is getting a bad start in life as it is, either growing up in an   where there is no love and the parents will probably end in divorce or being raised by a single parent, not much of a choice. I detest  this kind of behavior and that it has been become so commonly accepted. I agree with everything you say.|`|91f956efb63a51bcca06586fcc2fe99aaa	When people get married just because they have a baby it will just end in divorce. Why would you marry someone who you don't love but just have one thing in common with? It doesn't make sense! Its just hard to find someone to be with since the divorce rates have gone up people are just being more cautious about who they marry and don't want to end in divorce.|`|4JrDGW7Taa	Yes, marriage is getting more complicated. And the main reason for the greater complication is that we have more choices. And, to make the right choices is getting more difficult.|`|5hxWSezPaa	I don't see that your friend ruled out love as a prerequisite for marriage.  I think he is right.  If things are getting more difficult it is because of you.|`|o6xLWwZvaa	I think people in general make marriage complicated. Yes marriage is hard work, but it's not complicated unless one or both people make it. <br>  <br>  I think...<br>  Don't get married just because you have a baby. Don't get married just because of a deployment. etc..<br>  <br>  Get married because you are in love. <br>  <br>  Even if people are dating for years, why should they get married? People can date, live together for years and not have to get married. They can love each other very much, but see no need to rush into marriage. Even if the couple living together is doing everything that a married couple do...they don't need to get married. The marriage is just a piece of paper. The love is there with or without the marriage.<br>  <br>  For instance, I was dating my husband for 2yrs, then he proposed to me, we moved in together. We lived today for 4yrs, went through one year deployment..then got married when he came home from Iraq. Those 4yrs living together we acted very much as a married couple, just never set a wedding date.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	We are complicating things because in our society, we have all of our basic needs met and we strive to meet our higher needs in love relationships.  (Didn't use to be this way and in other cultures, still isn't)<br>  <br>  We are lucky that we have been so wealthy.  Financial loss might bring people back to the basics, I don't know...
W6Lj6Kqiaa	Yes it would be wrong because they are not giving you permission to do this and what would happen if one of the movies scratched and did not work after you finished with it if i was you i would definitely not do it so just make sure you have thought of everything good and bad before you decide what to do
b2Cr9E5Gaa	I would highly recommend you do this, mainly because your make up artist is going to be using there product, and you might for one want to see how they are going to do your make up, make sure you like it, and two see how long it lasts on your face and three MOST important, make sure that the products do not irritate your face, I have a big problem with some of the products out there and break out in rashes, and sometimes not until much later (I swear its because I sweat and the make up gets deep into my pores and my skin gets irritated). <br>  Plus if your getting all dolled up anyways for your trial, why not go out for a nice dinner with your husband to be? Or have a ladies night out?|`|LxvA4vGpaa	When I was getting married, I planned to have a "trial run" on my hair and makeup.  I planned the trial for the day of my bachelorette party so that way, I didn't have to worry about makeup or hair either day.  <br>  <br>  You do a trial run so that way, you AND your stylist can know exactly what you want, no questions asked.  And also, to see if what you saw in this picture or that really looks as good as you thought it would.  While I loved this one style of hair that I saw, when it was done on me, I just didn't care for it too much.  I didn't have enough/thick enough hair to actually be able to pull it off.|`|sEihaeLNaa	That way you will tell ur make up artist what you like and she will try a few things on you to see if thats what you really would like. You wouldnt want to be dissapointed with your make up on your wedding day. Same thing goes with hair!|`|iKYNUni0aa	so you know if your ok with your make up or not and so your not pissed off if u dont like it on your wedding day|`|19ILDxBsaa	Different make up artists do things incredibly differently.  For instance if you ask one for smokey eyes someone might put on a lot more, etc. making you look like a clown on your wedding...<br>  <br>  Also you want to make sure you don't have any kind of reaction to the kind of make-up they use.  the last thing you need on your wedding day is a rash from something.|`|gCsD5qtyaa	This is to make sure that you are going to enjoy what you will look like on your wedding day and really to experiment. <br>  <br>  Answer my ?:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AiSRRUBpQDVa5SiWyOov46zsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090227075041AAky2oE">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|IxzJ6SN5aa	I didn't know this was important. I guess maybe some people want to make sure the makeup works before the big day.|`|cGbTJobeaa	I did not have a trial run and I looked fine.  I went to a salon that frequently does weddng hair and make-up so I was not concerned about the quality of their work. I showed up at the salon on my wedding day and asked the lady to give me smoky eyes.  LOL.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, you'll look fabulous before going to bed or cleaning house.|`|sGP6s7uraa	So you'll know exactly what you're getting in to lol.  It's to help figure out what shades will look best and what "style" is more appropriate for you and the wedding day.  It's like taking a new vehicle out for a test drive.  You're taking make-up on a test drive with your face lol.

rFNN23b1aa	Probably not.<br>  <br>  You've hit your three strikes as far as this relationship goes:<br>  1- He broke up with you, not vice versa.<br>  2- You went psycho on him, whatever that means, flipped out, cursed him out, called him a lot, did something bad.<br>  3- You hooked up with his best friend.<br>  <br>  Maybe if you broke up with him in the first place and didn't do BOTH of those things you'd have more of a chance of him wanting to talk to you or have any sort of relationship with you again.<br>  <br>  He did break up with you for god knows what reason, leading to your emotions to run so high that you went "psycho" on him, and the fact that you even CONSIDERED hooking up with his friend means something shady was going on with this relationship, it wasn't completely genuine. Maybe you were more into it than him? I have no idea but it seems like you could do better, find someone who doesn't make you feel crazy or crappy and that you wouldn't want to make jealous (or hook up with his best friend.)<br>  <br>  I think your best bet is to move on to better things and better people.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|VCz1CtiLaa	I wouldn't talk to you if I were him|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	more than likely not|`|gibnbbWDaa	Lexxy you are very young and life is short..

Don't rush you will find love in someone who appreciates you... Find a GOOD man, they are out there..|`|xarKlp0Oaa	Give him a chance to cool down. I don't see why he wouldn't talk to you again.

yxRGDjs2aa	Hi, this is a curious one!<br>  As you are 23, you are a resposible adult.<br>  But I would have strong reservations about this guy.<br>  You've never met and he talks a lot about marriage.  That would worry me.<br>  I read you message very carefully and I have to say as he is upsetting you so much, I honestly believe I would call it a day!<br>  The last thing you want is to feel neglected as you have just finished a previous relationship.<br>  My advice, you don't need to be rushed into anything, why not take your time, take stock, have fun with groups of friends in your home town,  At 23 you shouldn't feel rushed into getting married, you should still be having fun.  He upsets you too much.<br>  Truly, I think you should finish this now.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  UK Personal Trainer|`|lWGaYxAbaa	first off: if u only talk through phone dont meet him he could be like 40 and just lying<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  CALL HIM BACK!!!!!!!!!

If you're feeling neglected already, you shouldn't take this any further. You also have to be very careful since you haven't met him in person and have met him online. <br>     If you ever plan to meet him, do it in a very public place with someone with you.<br>     From what you've said, I would also be careful that he may want you for your body. You can never be sure either way..|`|oUiVckg2aa	dont get me wrong, online dating is not really that different from dating people you meet on the club or pub. but basing on what you have just written here, you both are seemingly not ready for a relationship. you were just out of a relationship and he is always talking about marriage even before getting to really know you. marriage is an important contract. it is not like buying a dress and then returning it with the receipt should you both wish you have had enough of each other. this is not a healthy way of starting a relationship. before you both even start convincing yourselves that you are both genuinely in love with each other, meet each other first and talk face to face and spend time together. making phone calls and chatting are okay for those who already have more stable relationships who just use the said communication mediums simply because they are temporarily away from each other. i know you are upset right now but also try to use sense and sensibilty as you venture into this relationship.

I've always been afraid to try it (but admit looking at a few pictures, many which look like mug shots). I think it would be like a rummage sale where you have to go through a lot of junk to find a real treasure. A man I dated for awhile went on match.com after we broke up, met someone and married her and they're already divorced. That didn't stop him from doing it again.

I think you can have an emotional relationship online, but anything more - WHO KNOWS? Sometimes it works out, sometimes it doesn't. Whatever you do USE GOOD JUDGEMENT and DON'T GET PLAYED!<br>  <br>  "During this time, I met a girl on the Net that I actually I cared about. I've heard a lot of people say that you can't trust people on the Net but this girl seemed to understand me and care about me and my situation. We got along well and talked online for hours at a time. I was really digging this chick but, because I was broke, I had no way to really get to know her...I tried to resist, but she constantly called and emailed me anyway. It was no doubt that she was "feeling" me because she wouldn't let go....Again, I told her my situation but she still wanted to meet me. I wanted to meet her too, but I couldn't bring myself to do it. <br>   <br>  I felt bad for all of sweet words and love-talk we had spoken in our emails and online because I knew she would now feel as though I had led her on, but what could I do? I meant what I said, but things were moving too fast and my money was moving too slow. So, I HAD to end it because I didn't know how long it would take me to turn my life around and I didn't want to string her along. But, no matter how hard I tried, she would not let go. <br>   <br>  I felt pressured. And the strange thing is: Although she was a million miles away, she KNEW something was wrong with me. She could FEEL it. I guess it was her "Woman's Intuition" or "Feminine Instinct" or a vibe or something. I couldn't hide it, because she somehow already knew. So, I had to come clean and admit to her I felt pressured. It was a hard thing to do and I was disgusted with myself. <br>   <br>  Eventually...
MRxm67DPaa	hun, wow... im speachless some1 that did that to u is really messed up and yet u have nothen agianst her wat u should do is talk to her be like after alll these years i have managed to forgive u and u will always be and angle in my eyes and u should tell her i will always treat u like a queen now and forever becuase unlike him i know exacly how valuable u truly are.|`|38376c3fed7d8b040a68d894fe4ce37aaa	forget all earlier things & start new life.

I'd say if you want to be there for her and let her know you've always cared about her, then so be it. Maybe she'll let you inside her head. But there's no way to change the past.
g4mvfBQ8aa	I'd be kicking myself.  Unfortunately silly women are attracted to the guys that will treat them the worst.  Its like when you are in high school and you always wanted to be with the most popular guys, but they were typically not doing well in school or thugs or just the type to go nowhere IF they graduated, or players.  Then the ones you overlooked come back looking good, making mad money, cause they were smart and paid attention in class, too smart for you because you didn't pay them any mind.  Now they got the house, the car, the job they got because their grades were good enough to take them somewhere in life.  Its compelling to me as well when a woman does that.  Alot of women don't have enough self-esteem and think that the way they get treated is only what they think internally they deserve.  If they thought highly of themselves, then they would demand more out of who they chose to be with.  You get what you feel like you should have.  Period.|`|S8CZBCe2aa	She will not be happy to see you because you are you are a reminder of a really bad time in her life (even thou you were not the bad guy).

yoS4cAszaa	I think it is wrong. Would you like it if your boyfriend cheated on you with some skank? If he cheats on his g/f he would probably cheat on you too. If you really like him and he doesnt love her  tell him to break up with her.|`|td6WXhv4aa	Yes it's very wrong!|`|utGddhnVaa	I don't understand why you would love a cheater...its 100% garunteed you will be cheated on if you end up dating|`|zg6sgA3faa	He wants you to himself., which does not mean he will be all yours. it is a double standard.

People shouldn't have sex just for the sake of sex with random people, My girlfriend and I have sex all the time but only with each other so it actually means something.<br>  <br>  My suggestion don't help him cheat on his girl, who knows how many girls hes sleeping with on the side that's pretty gross actually. Maybe its just me... but yea if you know don't get involved. And if you think the guy your seeing is messing around... I would dump him.

Saying "im attractive" is clearly and really not up to you. Do i think you picture is attractive? absolutely but doesn't mean everybody else does. And they dont have to be hatin either. They just maybe dont like blondes or whatever their hold up is. Attractive is how a person feels about your looks. Not how you feel about your looks. I guess the point is, rate your looks not how people attracted to you, big difference.|`|5f449c637a79c3dd213f6d4bcfef22a0aa	because its not attractive to brag about yourself.

That's pretty much it in a nutshell. Women over 40 can tend to slow down sexually. Some of us guys aren't ready to slow down. Young ladies are usually ready at the drop of a hat. Any man over 40 that says he wants a genuine relationship with someone in their early 20's is a liar. It's as simple as that. I'm 58 and some days I'd like to spend an afternoon in the sack with a young lady. Just don't tell my wife I said that!|`|pRjvM6Taaa	Because the chemistry seems amazing between a guy who has been around and a young vibrant, energetic passionate young woman.He has confidence and knows that he can face and handle pretty much any situation life deals him...and still stay humble....and she will always find his inner confidence and his genuine and positive attitude irresistably attractive...and she will always give him incredible energy....|`|tIDNEwdMaa	The same reason a twenty year old man would fall in love with a twenty year old woman.

That does not change.|`|z9hyTp0jaa	i dont no y it it cos ive got a 42 year old after me i wanna get with him and he wants to be with me but he listenin to what people are sayin and he isnt followin his heart. see theres me and im not bothered what people say. the problem is he has kids in there teens so i need help aswell as u......|`|o6ntWzM1aa	sure there can be love love there though i am biased at 42 years old. i am looking for a young girl as i write this>|`|ZmyS0tkgaa	It's to make them feel young just imagine if you did that you could feel alot yougner then you are so chances are it's a midlife crisis kinda thing
lNXIEh5Yaa	Nineteen years old is still young. There's nothing wrong with living with your parents at that age. Tell your friends to give you a break. Don't let people pressure you into doing something you're not ready to do. If you're not ready to get your liscense, don't do it. If you're not ready for a job, don't get one. If you're not ready for college, don't go yet. If you're not ready to move out, you don't have to. You should do things at your own pace. Whatever YOU think is best for the sake of YOUR future. Because it's your own life :]|`|J7ByVZ3Aaa	I think at 18 if you are living at home you should at least be productive and take some college classes or get a job. You don't have to love your job, but to be sitting around doing nothing? That's bad. I think as long as you have a reason to be living at home (like you can't afford not to even when working) it's okay.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	I think this is a personal and individual issue and if you are comfortable living at home, and if your parents aren't in any particular rush for you to leave, stay at home.<br>  <br>  You are still young and have decisions to make.  So this sounds like a good situation for you.  I'd suggest filling your life with interests, trying to find a job and doing productive things with your time.<br>  <br>  take care and i wish you all the best.|`|jpmDjFNeaa	Your young right now so its good that you live with them. Til your 30 then that's a problem! But when you do leave your going to miss them like crazy and realize that she is your one and only best friends. About your friends just shut them up. You seem to be the right thing for you and that's all that should matter.|`|H0e0YAZ5aa	Dear at 19 you are not to old,when you are 30 you are to old, go to school so you can get a good job, do this while you can and are living at home.|`|Sd3kXRgGaa	Whenever you can sufficiently take care of yourself. It's not a good idea to move out too early... you can end up in deep water.|`|VP7A10bXaa	it depends on which country you live in. For example, in Italy it is completely acceptable to live with your parents as an adult.|`|O5KOwhovaa	Nothing wrong with it, if you and they are happy with it.|`|RpIeBQ6Naa	There's a difference between mooching and transitioning.  Once you turn 18 you're supposed to transition into adult life.  To do this, you at least need a job.  I'm not saying you should go out and get the first job that's offered to you and dedicate your life to it, but you do need to find something at least part-time until you find something you're passionate about.  You don't have to be stationary to search for your passion, and you don't have to move out right away to become an adult.  You do, however, need to have some kind of responsibility- a first step into adulthood.|`|CxAoiqDUaa	Nothing wrong with living with your parents, but you really need a job, and quit bumming from them. Time to pull your weight. If your not going to college, get ANY job! If you do decide to go to college, then still, get ANY job! There arent that many jobs to get to begin with, and to sit back and be choosy is just being LAZY! Help your sweet, unnerved parents out! Your a big girl now, need to act like it. It'd be nice for everyone to have a job they enjoy, but unfortunatly thats why its called WORK.|`|e304c56bff79ec6d59f96a991c27676aaa	Why can't you get a job that maybe isn't ideal while you are figuring out what you want to do. Honestly, it does sound pretty leech-ish to be living off your parents without going to college or having a job. Not to mention when you do figure out what you want to do you are going to have to explain to potential employers what you have been doing since high school and sitting on your butt watching TV is not going to impress anyone.|`|4D2ZRK6naa	there is nothing wrong with living w yr parents. smart you could end up in a mess. but you have to find a job and help in the future w/ bills etc. i know some mexican families that all live together beautiful homes they all help eachother they never run out of money and when one needs something there not without.but if you plan to get a partner move out you have made yr bed sleep in it. your on yr own|`|KcOpiKiYaa	Damn, tell your friends to give you a break. You basically just got out of high school. Im 19 and married with a daughter. I don't live at home but have a brother who is 24 or 25 that does. It's okay that you don't have a job either. So go ahead and take a break. Some people can;t go and bounce into the world without their mothers...:)|`|V90Ao2jfaa	YOu have a great mom. 19 is still young but before you know it you'll be 25.|`|WVzsrJGXaa	about 22|`|tXWFDp2Uaa	like u said get a job u wud like|`|pJcbV2cnaa	I think living at home with your parents at 19 is fine. Im 23 and living with my parents although I do have a job and help pay with rent. The way the economy is right now if I move out I would not survive out there. Perhaps you should do the same. Try to get a job it doesnt matter what type of job it is but that way you can get a sense of whats its like and you need to get yourself ready for when you do move out. It might be difficult for you to move and work for the first time because youre going to be on your own. If you experience some type of job now, see what its like you get use to the idea. Good Luck.  And dont listen to your friends. Not everyone is in the same situation and everyone does things differently.|`|trxEyVRLaa	Personally I think everyone will have a different opinion. Some people will be ready to leave home earlier than others - i'm planning to live with my parents till i'm like 23 so I can afford to rent somewhere or buy a flat because i'll no doubt have debts from University. So ignore your so called friends, go at your own pace and leave when you feel ready, because, I know it sounds cheesy, but in a way you're like a baby bird, if you leave the nest too early you'll just fall out of the tree and will have to go back and then start all over againw hen you are ready.|`|4gcTZNZBaa	I think a year inbetween high school and your new life is great. in fact I recently read an article saying students going into college do better if they take a year off in between to relax.<br>  <br>  but more then 2 years is too much, then you have to start your life.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	You're too old to live with your parents when living with them starts to interfere with your life.<br>  <br>  You aren't there yet so don't worry about it.<br>  <br>  right now you need to figure out what it is you want to do.  You're going to have to have some kind of post high school training to get a decent job.  It can be an apprenticeship, college, whatever.  <br>  <br>  If you're not sure what you want to do, then I recommend that you enroll in the local community college and work on getting your basics completed (English, math, science, maybe a language) while you decide what it is you want to do.  Even if you don't wind up going to college for a degree, the things you learn in class will enrich your life and increase your knowledge.<br>  <br>  What are your interests?  What kind of hobbies do you have?  What do you like to read or learn about? that's where you'll find clues to what you can do.  Also know that people no longer work at one career any more.  They often do one thing in their younger years and change later in life.|`|AA10500537	you have a great family and you ahould be so happy|`|7OTJW7fAaa	I don't think you're too old to be living at home with your parents, but you are too old to just be sitting around wondering what to do with your life.  Take a job, any job.  How do you know what you will enjoy and what you will be good at if you never try anything?  Try all kinds of jobs.  Even the ones you don't enjoy will teach you a lot about yourself.  <br>  <br>  Consider going to college and furthering your education.  You are severely limiting your opportunities by limiting your education.<br>  <br>  I suspect this is all more about your fear of change and the future rather than the problem of figuring out what you want to do.  Drop the fear, embrace change, be willing to take a chance, and get out in the world and work, interact, and live.|`|K4J6f1e0aa	WHAT!<br>  Your friends are retarded. They probably think it's weird that you live with your parents because they never had the great relationship as you do with your parents. You have a great mom. I'm Indian, and in Indian tradition, it's perfectly normal for a girl to be living with her parents when she's an adult. They actually stay with their parents until they get married. Have you seen the Pink Panther 2? If you have, you know the Indian girl? Her name is Aishwarya Rai (Bachchan... she just got married over the summer) and she has always lived with her parents until she got married, which was when she was 30, I think. <br>  Don't worry about it. Your friends are just being stupid =]|`|vFFgHI9Kaa	I don't think 19 is to old..I know a guy who is 27 and has never lived anywhere but his parents house - now THAT is too old.  <br>  <br>  Personally, I left home at 17 (to go to university) I couldn't wait to move out!  this had nothing to do with my family as I loved them but I just couldn't wait for Independence. I think once you start earning money, you'll start to want your own place and decorate it how you want, have friends over etc.  I think you are being sensible by taking your time and figuring out what you want to do...just don't wait until you are well into your twenties before you move out.
nHyNksmkaa	Rebecca and Jane sound like very horrible people, and your friend Sally is getting roped in. I honestly don't think you can really count Sally as a friend anymore if she is hanging out with people like that, and the fact that she doesn't trust you anymore is a problem. you and Jill should just forget about them and get on with your lives and let them act like that. you don't people like that in your life.|`|AzcfZ12kaa	Well what else could you do? <br>  You did the right thing.<br>  Those girls are obviously acting like jerks,so if Sally is even your friend she would know when to stop being a jerk.<br>  Just leave them alone,and if Sally really wants to be your friend,she'l come to you.|`|ruz4EBkkaa	You did the right thing.|`|iFz6SP7paa	Yes you did the right thing if i you didn't stand up for yourself she would just keep sending more texts and being cheeky to you your right to stand up for yourself <br>  xxx

Just because you break up doesn't mean you can never speak to each other again. <br>  <br>  Also, since he's getting out of the Military soon, so he'll probably be able to spend more time with you. So maybe you won't have the same problems you did before. <br>  <br>  He's YOUR ex-boyfriend, so follow your heart, but I would give this relationship another chance if I were you.<br>  <br>  I wish you both the best!
vb7RZ0Mvaa	It definitely sounds to me like this guy is not ready for a relationship. He may like you and enjoy your company but he's young and all he wants to do is party. Maybe he will be ready for a relationship in a few years, but don't waste your time on him now. Continue being friends if you like but don't have any expectations for it to lead to a relationship. Find someone that will treat you the way you want to be treated and that wants only you. Good Luck!|`|9nqVABVtaa	im sorry but i think you are offically in the friend zone
Vp4np23Qaa	Whatever you do DON'T show her your diary. She may be your bff and that is great, but your diary is meant for you to vent so that no one will have to see it. <br>  If you want her to know what is going on, tell her a little at a time how you are feeling about things lately and maybe she can give you some great, insightful advice by just talking it out. Make it simple and tell her slowly :)|`|WCIjxxL3aa	I think that if you really trust your friend that go ahead and show her. If there is even a slight chance that she could tell or show it to anyone I don't think it is a good idea. If this is something very personal that you don't want anyone else to know, if you tell her there is always a chance that she could tell someone else. Secrets travel very quickly because one person tells two people and those two people tell two people and those four people tell two people and so on. I suggest telling a sibling or a perent if you need to vent to anyone. Most likely they will keep it private.|`|Bwo4ugP8aa	Yes if you guys have been open with one another.  Its a risk but you have know her for a long time and can tell by now who she is.  Being more open is great and can enhance a friendship.  You can't worry about your fears because fear will always drive you into a negative realm.|`|ZgAAonBwaa	no way. a diary is a private thing for only your eyes to see.

'Suffer the indignity of obligating myself to an impure woman.'  What!!? Just because a woman isn't 'pure' doesn't make her an less importance or worthy of your respect.  It's actually quite awful to phrase it that way.  Maybe you should rethink your preferred qualities in a woman, because you'll never get one with that attitude.  Maybe consider women closer to your age as well as 18-25?  I really don't know where you can meet a chaste woman, maybe there's a website with people searching for partners, but like I said earlier, I'd probably say most chaste women would like their man to be chaste too *cough* hypocrite *cough*  So if I were you I'd look it up on google or something and maybe accept a wider variety of people and not be so picky.|`|hHjPFxEdaa	Lmao..why would a virgin want someone like you?|`|AA11193401	i wish you luck|`|0Ew1HY3haa	Ok I didn't actually read this because it looks like you might possibly be a hypocrite.  i mean really, what 29 year old male is a virgin? everyone makes mistakes.

Because the girls of these two country are really good looking and faithful.<br>  <br>  Yes my friend, this is the problem of distancing from religion in the most parts of the world, which is showing it's signs today. I can understand you, as I have the same feeling as you. I hate to touch a girl who has slept with someone else before. I want her to be mine, and remain mine, and of course I am hers and remain for her. I want to be the first and the last person that touches her body...<br>  <br>  But please don't want something for which you haven't been faithful.|`|ulYTAfXtaa	why don't you try attending some type of church-related function sometime and see who all you meet? you don't necessarily have to go to service, just go to any sort of thing it sponsors. or heck, go to a christian concert. like really. you should meet plenty of possible future wives for you there.<br>  also, kudos to you for having morals. that's not so easily found nowadays. you're a minority, congrats. :)
y0T5V7hIaa	Honestly, you miss her and your sad.  Its not going to be easy but in a few weeks or a few months you'll be much better.  Keep yourself busy, the more you have to do and the more you have going on, the less you think about her.|`|f6fe44c4dd4dfec25bc0198c9161f1d9aa	you confront her. you tell her that shes on your mind, and you cant seem to get her out. tell her the truth. have the confidenece. afetr that, wait and see wat happens..hope it all works out...|`|73GkepzFaa	Call up some friends and just go hang out. Get out of the house and have fun. If girls see you happy and having fun you can move on and maybe find someone else. If it's really bothering you write her a letter and find out how she's doing. Good luck~

Vp4np23Qaa	Either he was being sarcastic or...not. By the sound of the last thing he said, it sounds like he admitted he had feelings for you, but then realized that maybe he didn't want to tell you right then. So when he said that, it was just his guy instinct kicking in, telling him to not admit his feelings.|`|41S75G5Eaa	awww that is so cute!<br>  i think he felt good about you opening up to him that he took a chance to tell you how he feels,<br>  but kinda like backed out because he might think you dont feel the same way<br>  he totally likes you!  ;)|`|HpNmpH8Daa	He probably wanted to tell you that he liked you, but not in a text. That's not very romantic. He seems like a nice guy who wants to make you happy. Talk to him about it, or you could make the first move.
3wKGTZvAaa	If you have nothing to say, it's better to keep it that way because what you say will likely be more boring and hurtful to your "communication reputation." Or wait for something to happen and then go and talk to her, i.e. if you see her staring at something or looking at something ask her about it.
1Lo34oEDaa	i hate to be the one to tell you this but i found out the hard way asking this question about myself. ppl are gonna be rude to you when you ask this question and it kinda sux. im not gonna be rude cause im nice. i honestly i would so go out with a guy like you but you are a couple years younger then me and i have a bf sry but good luck there is someone out there for you dont sell yourself short!<br>  <br>  =)|`|OhkY8n7Yaa	Yea because he sounds hot!!<br>  <br>  But then again he sounds like he could be a rapist!!|`|WFP46Ek9aa	probaly|`|MN8P5zyoaa	Hale Yes|`|ocy3PQoMaa	that discripition makes him sound kinda gay but ya whatever you can get go for it|`|jXnpJM0Oaa	Absolutely.

Leave the guy alone.
JhvqUvlsaa	I feel this way sometimes too; I think it would get better over time. First though, get rid of the jealousy; there's no use in being jealous of others. If you want what they have, then make a plan to work towards getting it yourself. If you can't do what they did to get it, then don't envy them anymore. =). <br>  <br>  I would focus on what's in front of you and when you do see your friends, enjoy the time you have with them to the fullest and appreciate the times you do have with them.<br>  <br>  Things will get better; they always do. Good luck!
twWQwax9aa	I love my brother so much and I am the luckiest sister in the world because I have him in my life!<br>  <br>  He is kind, generous and loving and he is the strongest, bravest and cleverest person I have ever met!<br>  <br>  He has been through a lot and he has a lot of hardships and pain everyday but he never complains or gives up even when it would be far easier to do so. He's only 2 years younger than me so we have always been close. <br>  <br>  My little brother is my hero!<br>  <br>  xxx<br>  xx<br>  x|`|K4J6f1e0aa	Ehhh, I have two brothers. I'm the middle child -.-<br>  Mmm, the younger one's alright. He likes to hug a lot and sometimes it's really irritating, but if I need to tell someone something that's bugging me, I can always tell him and know he's not going to tell anyone anything that I said.<br>  Then there's my older brother. He's simply the most annoying person I've ever known. I mean once every blue moon we get along, like today, but then other times he makes fun of me for no reason. Once when he was with his friends, I heard him making fun of me. Pshh, and for some reason he's popular. 0_o I mean, how does someone become popular just by trashing someone else? And then when he's lonely at some party because his friends aren't there (like today) he hangs out with me and my friends. And he always makes fun of my high school and says that his is better. he goes to an all guys school and I go to an all girls school! What, does he expect me to transfer or something, because I CAN'T and I don't WANT to! -.- I'm not very fond of him|`|rPoKRm8gaa	ommmmmmmggggg. my brother used to be SO NICE TO ME..!!!!!!!!!!!!

He burst into tears because he isn't a lady lol. We love him so much.|`|13f8355359652cfde88b26bd8b3d6c6caa	He's a jackass, pees on the toilet seat, hits me, leaves a trail of junk everywhere he goes, annoys me...<br>  <br>  But at the same time I don't know what I'd do without him :)
GbZuiPu3aa	Yes I have.  And even now we are separated, in fact last week, after a fight started, he tried to choke me, bruised my chin and arm.  Scratched my face, left hand prints around my neck, and had me so hard around the throat he broke my necklace in two pieces and left welts around the back of my neck almost like a rope burn.  You should never feel like that. And if you do, get out as fast as you can.  He will say he's sorry and it won't happen again, but it will!!!  Good luck with your decision!|`|7foornMVaa	Nope, but he has been afraid of me...........|`|sSEy6KYiaa	Although I am the husband I would say that if you are ever afraid that your husband may hit or physically try to harm you in your relationship he should either seek counselling or you should leave him.<br>  <br>  A woman should NEVER have to feel threatened by her husband - he is supposed to PROTECT you NOT harm you.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Never<br>  <br>  I've only ever been afraid of one guy I dated, and broke stopped seeing him after the second date - and luckily I did because he became a stalker and could have become violent with me.

Invite him to party and then just have fun.|`|eXpZD0vlaa	Sometimes we screw up things and there's no fixing them...<br>  <br>  With a divorce and a business to deal with, he probably isn't interested in anything or anyone that's going to make his life any more complicated than it already is.  And a divorce has a way of making men not want to deal with women in general.  And you sound complicated.<br>  <br>  Do yourself and him a favor and give him space.  If he's still interested, he'll call.  But I doubt it.  Move on.
3wKGTZvAaa	If you know he's over dramatic or too sensitive, don't do things that would make that result occur. He's not comfortable with it. You may find it fun, but that's bullying.

CQA4HAdmaa	Yes.  Let her know why you hit her first an how frustrated you were and then let her know you're sorry for hitting her and hope she is OK because you didn't want to hurt her.  Misunderstandings happen, but when both people sometimes hurt each other, someone should make the first move to mend it.  Don't call her, talk to her away from others and do it kindly.  For something as small as that, you should not let it affect your friendship.  You also should not hit others.

Where there will be others around to hang with and maybe you won't feel the need to sleep next to your mom. I used to have a similar problem. I used to get scared at night, and paranoid that someone would break into the house. And I made my mom sleep next to me for about a month or so. I got help and I'm okay now, but getting help really makes things better. You could have a disorder or something, or maybe there's an underlying cause of this. The best advice I can give is cut down on salt, (it makes things worst at least for me) and get some help from a doctor. I hope all goes well. :)|`|p5uXXi54aa	I think you should definitely move out of your mom's bedroom. 11 is way too old to be sleeping in your mom's bed and you yourself are obviously uncomfortable with it. Why don't you begin by sleeping in your own bed and having mom sleep on a cot or sleeping bag in your room for a night or two....next step Mom sleeps in the hall...then finally Mom is in her own bed and you are in yours. This gradual separation will help you get used to your new independence. If you sleepwalk, have Mom return you gently to your bed at night. She needs to be lovingly consistent and help you gain your independence and confidence in this and not allow you to revert back to the old habit.<br>  If you wake up at night and can't return to sleep, keep a favorite book at your bedside and a book light to read yourself back to sleep...an uplifting, positive book such as "Secret Garden" or "Little Women"...no scary stuff. This too, will help you deal with your separation fears in a positive way and put you in charge rather than your fears. "Focus on the Family" is a great website where you and your mom can find some resources to help and encourage you. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.focusonthefamily.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.focusonthefamily.com/</a>
RCfc9hMKaa	Why are you still hanging around her? She wants to be with you and is rubbing it in your face you were rejected by the other girl. "Now you know how it feels" sort of thing. I would suggest ignoring her entirely because she has different expectations for your relationship than you do.
0011Smdtaa	What about a simple colour theme.  Maybe blue or red and do everything up to match that colour.  Let your guests know they are expected to dress in that colour as well...You can make a coloured punch in the same colour and tablecloths paper plates, napkins everything ... Very simple but effective and easy.  Good luck.
HAHA2u13aa	Have the party,prepare a box(I suggest a hat box signed and decorated by you and other friends)before hand,have each one of your friends bring a written special memory of her.Before the party ends each friend can read out loud to her their written memory after wards placing it in the box for her to keep.Have someone tape the party,put it to music and send it to her after the move.Whatever you decide,she will be thrilled to have a special friend like you!Peace.|`|lMYcTk6Iaa	Throw her a really amazing party with all of your friends. If she's your best friend, show her that you're going to miss the hell out of her and spare no expense.

It's going to be expensive enough supporting yourself and a baby. Do you really need a deadbeat cheating husband in the mix? I can't imagine what he is bringing to the relationship if it's not love, trust or even finances.|`|20ee7f2aadb248558085cabc8d4743ccaa	You have made your decision. You said you do not want to confront him. The question is, can you live with the fact that he has cheated. You will be able to forgive him but you will never forget. If you can be happy with that, good luck.<br>  M|`|4c53bf469dfe96ac19d353f625f2d1daaa	Yes you need a mentor, you will have 2 children soon.|`|djUMvICoaa	If you don't confront him how are you going to get him to stop and will you ever be able to get over the fact that he did?   Why is he home not doing nothing?  Flipping burgers at least gets him out of the house and a paycheck coming home.  Why did you marry an unemployed fellow anyway?  Why didn't you wait until he had a job so you could see what his character was really like?  Now you know, he's a leech and a cheat and now he's going to be a dad.  Is that the kind of role model you want for your child?|`|4c376969a4eb7f4374a960b4fcf8b881aa	wow, what to say to answer this question.. im pretty sure you've heard it over and over "leave him! hes not good for you" .... and the truth of the matter is is... your going to do what YOU want to do.. as much as people tel you their opinions.. such as this one here that Im gong to share... you in the end have the last word... Yes, leave him... even if you are pregnant.. you're young... he's young.. right now, you've been able to handle it by yourself and your tolerating him and his way.. but i promise you and guarantee that you will get tired of it... even looking at him will discust you eventually.... but like i said you just have to get to that point.your obiously not because you would have been gone.<br>  <br>  anywho good luck and hopefully its not too late when you do decide the best thing for you and your unborn child|`|5J7iplFzaa	I don't think anything is wrong with you but I think there is something wrong with him. He seems to be using you and you and your child would be better of without him. Please don't take this the wrong way but if he loves you so much why is he out with other women and not with you?? I would confront him about and take some space from eachother. I think you will see that you are worth so much better than him. Good luck!|`|aSE7sihFaa	Yes, cheating is wrong!!! Please re-evaluate. He's not working, you're paying all the bills and on top of that he has the nerve to cheat. I'm sure you love him very much, but is this the kind of future you want with this man?|`|8747ad5946dec06c50e2f01268404c87aa	He loves you enough to cheat...<br>  Yeah, you got yourself a real winner there.<br>  If i were you, I'd sell his services to blue haired church ladies and make that boy earn his keep!<br>  If he's gonna be unfaithful, he might as well make money at it!
0011Smdtaa	Is your dad an *** ???? YES !!! Does he know hes an *** ???? Probably not !!! I'm sorry you have such an immature dad and you have gone through so much crap because of him...  Can you please talk to someone, a school guidance councellor, a telephone youth worker, just someone safe who you can talk, cry or scream to.... You need to get some feelings out hunny bun !!!|`|AA11286455	Babe, don't take on this huge emotional responsibility.  It's not right, it's not appropriate, esp. for a child, of ANY age.  <br>  <br>  Your father needs to grow up and DEAL with his own problems and immaturity.  Unfortunately, everyone else gets affected and suffers.  <br>  <br>  Get some formal counseling or "check in" with someone you trust, like a teacher or guidance counselor.  <br>  <br>  DO NOT put your life on hold for or bc of your father--unless you are easily angered, easily lose your temper, easily lash out physically or verbally, you need to talk to that girl.  If your behavior at some point isn't what you'd like, explain that you're under some pressure at home and you'll try to do better (then DO better).  She should understand and support you.  <br>  <br>  This will not be the last time in your life that you'll be facing conflicting situations and feelings at the same time.  You'll be getting a head start on learning how to "juggle" and how to respond appropriately when faced with multiple challenges at the same time.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|K4J6f1e0aa	Ugh, I'm sorry. <br>  Why don't you try letting your anger out physically?

Also, I would have an announcement made in a newspaper or on the radio, acknowledging what that person did for me (with their permission, obviously).  Money or material items just would be out of place for someone who did something heroic for you.

It is impossible for a person to control how they feel. You can't decide to be or not be angry or sad or happy so how could you decide who you like or love or don't? It's not up to us.

e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	I think u should c one first to know why yr thinking like that, and then take her again to another one for both of u, money should never be a thing.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  _K_|`|7foornMVaa	Yes, go to counseling. Money is the root of all evil and when someone is accustom to it then all of a sudden doesn't have it, it can make or break a marriage.  Marriage is a partnership and both should work unless there are children are home.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|q84KT11saa	Seeking council is probably a great idea.  They can make sure your both on the same page in an organized way.  They may also provide you with some exercises/tools that will allow you to maintain and have a very strong marriage.  <br>  <br>  If your looking for a long lasting marriage, you want to marry someone that will love you for you, regardless of your income.  Someone who marries you simply for your money likely won't deal well with lack of money.<br>  <br>  When I met my husband he was working his way up the food chain.  Ive been with him for 9 years now.  We have struggled, we have gone through tough times, but we always had one another.  Now he makes 6 figures, the money is nice, but if he lost it all tomorrow, I would still love him because of who he is, not what he makes.|`|eXpZD0vlaa	Be open to her about your money issues.  If she doesn't understand the value of money, show/teach her.  If you're both not ready to understand that money is the responsibility of both of you in a marriage, you're not ready to be married.|`|c1bqzJqwaa	no money no honey...|`|1k7LIZVWaa	Yes you should see a counselor.  You don't sound ready to me.  You make marriage sound like you are choosing the "right car" or something.  You should have more to offer in a relationship than your bank account.  If you aren't good for more than that, you aren't going to find happiness.  Money can't buy you love.  Love yourself first and you will be a rich man.<br>  <br>  Too bad for you.  I guess go about it the way you would about any other "transaction" in your life.  Wow.  I'd rather be broke than be you.
OZdjhym6aa	From the way you have written your question I think you already know that you have to leave him. No woman deserves to be treated this way. He has already shown that he won't change. I know it is scary to be on your own but surely anything is better than dealing with this? If you stay I fear things would only get worse. <br>  <br>  Do you have any family or friends who can take care of you and help you though this? Their support and love will make such a difference to how you cope with moving on with your life. <br>  <br>  Take the first step in looking after yourself and leave this jerk behind, you are worth so much more!|`|0bYcYz2jaa	First, find someplace safe you can go.  Then, just up and leave, don't plan too far ahead, don't warn him, don't tell anyone, just go.  Finally, once you are safe, tell the authorities about his affairs with minors.  Those girls are probably too naive to understand what he did to them and no one deserves to have to deal with a creature like him.  Once you are out of the relationship, seek counseling, spiritual or professional or both, and maybe you should go to a women's shelter until you feel strong enough to deal with it on your own.  I have a friend who finally got away from her abusive husband and it took years and four kids to protect, three of them daughters, before she made it.  But she is doing ok now, she just needed somewhere safe to run.  Maybe that's all you need.  There is nothing wrong with being alone for a while, you get a chance to get to know yourself better and eventually attract someone who will appreciate who you are.|`|FewhKlx9aa	You need some heavy duty counseling.You get an abortion for him and spend money to keep him.You need to find a life and get rid of him and find out why you feel he is the one and only.You sound young or you would'nt of done this for him.You need to find some self esteem|`|YCUJMvWQaa	my friend, you need to open your eyes and realize what hes doing to you is not right one bit, forget the guy, you dont need him seriously, and abortions are wrong, your taking a lifae away!<br>  my cousin has a baby and shes on her own her boyfriend left her but shes still going to colege trting to make something of herself because shes a smart girl, you should do they same forget the guy hope i helped some takecare|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	girl, that break up with this abuser..he is a loser..sounds like too much drama going on here..|`|ByUS0k8waa	You should just pick up and leave. Don’t you deserve better than that?! Once a cheater always a cheater. You cant change him unless he is ready to change. Trust me you may not find another man tomorrow but there is someone out there that wants to love you and treat you the way a women should be treated. I went though alot of boyfriends I was afraid to leave for more serious reasons but in the end after I stopped looking for Mr. right I found him. He just walked into my life one day and has never left me since. <br>  <br>  I was a single mother, full time student, and worked a full time job (60 hours a week). Still God put him there for me. Its just like he was made for me and I was made for him. Someone will come along and love you like you never thought they could. Start to do things for yourself. Find a hobby, get a job just for the fun of it, or go back to school. Something to make you feel better about yourself and when you are focused on yourself trust me the man will come along who will love you for you. Not what you can do for him or buy him. <br>  <br>  The reason you feel no one else will want you is because you have to learn to love yourself before you can love someone else or they can love you. Right now you don’t love yourself or you wouldn’t be putting yourself though this. Trust me just learn to love you for who you are and then someone else will be able to see what a great person you are and they will love you for who you are. I hope you find happiness.|`|OHfZFR31aa	You should be more afraid of being with him than being alone. Why have you stayed this long? Nobody who loves you cheats on you, demands you to get an abortion or would rather hang out with a 16 year old sister than his gf.<br>  <br>  Get out ASAP - move back with your parents or with a friend so you are not on your own for now. Start to get some self respect and confidence back and realize that no man should ever treat a woman like that. When you learn to really love yourself, then you will find someone who loves you back. Don't rush into any relationships.<br>  <br>  And think of this as a learning experience. You now know what a bad experience is and will never allow yourself to get into another one again. You will be aware of the warning signs so you don't waste 5 years with a moron like him|`|MjSLQlIHaa	break up with him in front of your family members they would absolutely back your decision, and make sure he walks away and leaves you untouched. you shouldve been left him a long time ago he's got issues i mean seriously, and he's a punk for hitting on you dont waste no more time on dude, and if he cant take your decision like a man and you feel he's gonna try and hurt you go to the police. leave him seriously! good luck and just go!|`|20ee7f2aadb248558085cabc8d4743ccaa	Why do you want to be with someone who cheated on you, especially with a minor.

The part of you that loves you is talking to you right h now. Are you gonna listen? <br>  No one can choose it for you. you have to be the one to take the next step. and if you do, he may come whining back but he will never be anything different.. Would you rather be alone for now, or spend the rest of your life this way. You know exactly who he is, and believe this peolpe like him will never change. He has treated you like dog crap stuck to his shoe. If you stay with him one more minute, it will all be your fault.<br>  Get tough, you have our support.|`|DBUmR8FTaa	Dump him you can do better. He us using you. There is some man out there waiting to meet you and he can't because you won't move on with your life because you are afraid to be alone.He sounds selfish like he only cares about his self. Don't you want a man who will treat you and your child wonderful. You deserve better. Think of your child do you want your child to grow up in this environment. Do you want your child to think it is ok to treat women this way. I am not saying it will be easy but is it easy living with a cheater who is abusive.He messed with a minor he has no morals. What if when your child grows up he messes with it.Don't be afraid move on.Don't wait until the best years of your life have gone by because you are hoping he will change. Good Luck. I wish you the best.|`|VAI6MtPIaa	How and why did you spend $1,000 to keep him from cheating on you? He doesn't deserve to be with someone like you if he can't keep it in his pants. You'll find someone worthy of your love and you'll be a lot better off without him. If he's cheating with a minor you might want to tell him that it's against the law... and that he can end up in jail because of that. You seem to be a great and loyal person and you should find someone who is the same. Leave him quick before things get worse.|`|b3YMLS61aa	To be honest that is how my girlfriend was, she was with some real abusive jerks. Then i came along. And i treated her the best she has ever been treated. i never yelled at her, i never hit her or anything of that nature. but then she said i was too good for her and she dumped me. So i would dump him. you will find someone. But my word of advice is dont be stupid and if you find someone that treats you good dont get rid of him. And i never even thought of cheating on her. even when i was deployed. but i know she was less then faithful to me. So you will find someone who dosent suck.|`|r9Ztl8rfaa	honey.. thats horrible! if you kept the baby (which i hope you did).. then you MUST get out.. this is abuse to you and the baby.. please get out, its not fair the way youre being treated!!! You wont be alone forever, and if he gets too angry to hurt you, he could even kill you.. men do not have power over women.. and If you are afraid hel hurt you if you leave, then you need to call services to come with you, or get a family member to be with you.. stay with friends and family when you break up with him, they wont let you be alone.. please be safe, and smart and get out.|`|zifEvqy2aa	It sounds to me like you are codependant on your boyfriend, or I should say someone who thinks he is your boyfriend.  You need to tell him Goodbye, as your pointing at the door tell him dont let that hit you in the a-- on your way out,  you do not deserve this treatment and I gaurantee you if you get back with him you will always have trust issues, and he will cheat again.  Get out of this contaminated relationship now.|`|q84KT11saa	Once a cheater, always a cheater.  He clearly doesn't care about your feelings and well being.  Nobody deserves to go through this.  Call an abused woman's shelter in your area if you have nowhere to go.  <br>  I'm assuming your working, so you can get your own place.  If your afraid of him get out of there while he is away.  I highly recommend you call an abused woman's shelter.  They will give you all the support you could ever need for your area.|`|O5KOwhovaa	If you don't want to be cheated on or treated badly, then it would make sense to leave the guy who has cheated on you and has been treated badly.<br>  <br>  Why on earth would you spend 1000 on a guy to "keep him from cheating?"<br>  <br>  Are you insane?<br>  <br>  You don't want to be left alone? Would you rather be dead? Because that's what will happen if you don't leave him.<br>  <br>  Stop being so gullible. Grow up, and use your common sense.|`|BE2vknbHaa	Its best for you to leave him. I'm sure you know that. He has shown that he has no love for you if he is willing to do all these things to you. You cant buy anyone's love and having to give him money to keep him from cheating is a clear sign that you should  move one. It is going to hurt at first but you will eventually get over him and find someone who is a better person. Your concern should be on you and your child.|`|3WjmlAbnaa	You're kidding right?  You need to move on.  You must be REALLY afraid of being alone if it allows you to justify him  repeatedly  cheating on you.  And once with a 'minor!!!

Not sure what you spent the $1000 on but that was money I am sure you could have put to better use.

You didn't mention whether you had the baby.  Obviously this is a more difficult situation to deal with if you have a young child.  But they are equipped to assist you.  You are going to need to learn to love, cherish, and take care of yourself, and to respect yourself enough that you do not tolerate abuse from anyone.  You owe this to yourself.  You need to make whatever changes are necessary to enjoy your life.  "Being with" someone who treats you badly in any way, isn't really sensible behavior, is it?  Of course you are not really with a guy who cheats on you.  He's with someone else whenever he wants to be and you just get to wait for him to come back home and --treat you badly again!  Somethings wrong with this picture and it won't get fixed unless YOU fix it.  I do wish you much strength as you work toward treating yourself well.|`|GbZuiPu3aa	RUN...RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN...You will get over him, but he won't change. EVER... NEVER... NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

He's a child molester, having sex with underage teens and that means he can bring home any kind of STD that you can think of and give it to you.  He also let you know where he stands with kids.  You need to leave this guy and find a life that is a life or you'll wake up and find you are next to him in his gutter and that's a hard place to get out of.|`|ls2M7rcHaa	just leave woman! stop being so scared and go with a relative for a while and lay low!|`|Wdi4QRPsaa	REPORT HIM TO THE POLICE DUH!

Maybe some cookies or cupcakes?<br>  That's always fun.<br>  You could play in the rain, Lol. But I know that it's not too fun.<br>  Be creative. I know I'd still love to make an obstacle course or something and you guys can try it.<br>  Make little huts and play games?

1hciyvKdaa	We are not psychic, and with the news showing us all the murders, rapes, kidnappings, drugs and alcohol use with teens, its a scary thought when our child doesnt come home. You know your age, you know your maturing, as parents we get stuck in the your our child not our teen or young adult. Forgive us ok. the day mom stops caring is the day she doesnt love you anymore ok. Each time you leave keep that .50 in your pocket for a call home, you may not hear ok hun come home later, but mom will get the call that means, you think of her like she thinks of you ok.  3.5 hours late, no matter the time of day is a long time. After 1 hour late, the mind starts creating scenarios.|`|xk5XK6CPaa	I can see both of your guys sides.<br>  <br>  <br>  * your mom was just worried about you, and you came home 3hrs and 25mins late...<br>  <br>  * You didnt have cell phone to check the times, you had lots of fun bc it whent by rele fast. <br>  <br>     I think she should trust you that you didnt do drugs or anything. you just didnt pay attention to the time.

Put yourself in her shoes.  in todays time it is nerve wracking when you dont know where your children are.  give her some time and gain back her trust.  you might also invest in a watch.|`|d1TTwwUUaa	I don't know either. Could it be the friends you hang with or her not liking you bf. Have you given her reasons in the past. Talk to her.|`|nZXLvfDoaa	parents worry its natural, truth is you should have atleast called her via payphone.<br>  <br>  streets are no longer safe anymore, no matter where you live|`|KcOpiKiYaa	Don't worry so much. It's not like your mother hates you, she's just looking out for you. My mom used to be the same way until I showed her that she could trust me and that I wasn't doing anything bad. I had came in past my curfew plenty of times. I even had spent the night at my boyfriend's place a couple times. You shouldn't argue with her. Just show her that you are listening to her and then try your hardest to show her that you are listening!|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	three hours and 25 minutes late would be cause for me to worry about my own kids, too.  Your mother was likely frantic because she didn't hear from you and had no idea whether you were dead in a ditch or alright.<br>  <br>  they say "no news is good news" but it's not always true in the case of young girls.  parents worry.<br>  <br>  i would have worried about you if i were your mom, too.<br>  <br>  maybe it's time to invest in a watch.<br>  <br>  take care.|`|FyAHNpQbaa	you couldn't see that it was getting dark outside and couldn't call her from a payphone?<br>  excuses, excuses

4gcTZNZBaa	I am also one of 4 girls in close age range and don't get along with my mother. Talk to a counciler to help figure out your diffrences and as far as a quite place goes, in warm weather I have a hiding place outside and i just go for walks to escape. Otherwise lock the bathroom door and just hang out or take a nice bath to relieve stress.|`|d1TTwwUUaa	Keep talking to mom and dad until they GET IT. Otherwise if you have a basement tell them you wnat a bed put down there. You need some alone private time.|`|KcOpiKiYaa	Well I'm not sure how old you are. Go have a "My Night Out"...That's what I usually do when I feel that I am being bothered too much. Have you tried talking to your family about this? Maybe you should.|`|nBa2euH4aa	You need some time to yourself for sure. Go find a hiding spot and read a book or journal. A car, the roof, under your bed, the attic, uner a sink lol what ever, where ever. You need alone time to destress, so hide for an hour or so. Make a deal with your little sis that each of you get two hours a day on the weekend to have the room alone. You have to take control and set limits. Good luck!

Best answer from a good resource. Sighned, Anna Marie.|`|kvhc5eFIaa	Don't take this the wrong way bro, but, I think it is too risky. If she has slept with that many guys, why would she stop with you? I mean, she most likely treated the other guys like a "prince" too. You know?<br>  <br>  I'm just saying, old habits are hard to break from; an unruly woman/girl is even harder to break from her ways. Nobody likes getting hurt. And the best way to avoid that, is to avoid the possibility altogether. It'll be hard if you decide to break up with her I'm sure. But, it may save you some pain, as well as, gain a little respect from your peers.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|a0Vg5vMyaa	she sahud hook up with spencer....|`|YtSGbYqEaa	dont worry about other people just be happy with her and as long as shes good to you and you love her all that shouldnt matter...it was like that with me and my bf we just got out of high school but when we were there people would tell him things about me but he stayed by my side and never let them get to him thats how i knew he loved me just be strong
kvhc5eFIaa	That is all you could have done bro. Sounds like you handled it respectably, so, the only thing left for you to do now is move on.<br>  <br>  But, you also can always wait and see. You never know what might happen down the road. But don't get your hopes up. If it is meant to be, it'll happen when the time is right.|`|Y2iEM9jcaa	no offence but maybe she thinks your ugly and went out with another guy to stop you from dating her|`|NWTfFEuVaa	It all depends on how you told her. But then again, maybe she wasn't that into you. If you had a shot, the things you could have done, was to befriend her before you tell her and make her feel special. Let her know that she means a lot to you before you tell her, and maybe if you did that then you wouldn't of had to tell her. But if she wasn't into you to begin with, there is nothing you could have done.|`|CGlDAvkAaa	if she's only dating this other guy and its not a steady thing, then ask her out to a place where you can have fun, like the school volleyball game or at a dave & busters kind of place. I tell everyone this, be prepared for rejection, cause if they're not interested, they will say no and it will hurst your feelings.
r1mmYhBQaa	It is quite possible, maybe you should say something to the dog before he decides it's better to move on. lol|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Ever heard of punctuation!|`|2KC467tFaa	I think it's possible.

Apologize.<br>  <br>  You were "offended", but her friend was trying to give you a clue.........communication is usually a good thing with women.<br>  <br>  IF you'd asked to stick your tongue down her throat, and she'd excitedly accepted.........think how much better that might have turned out.<br>  <br>  If you have the opportunity to might it right, you should, (apologize), if not, Learn from your mistake, and move on.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Luck|`|7EfUQ1MZaa	um thats gross <br>  <br>  maybe you shouldntve kiss her sometime even tho you are drunk you can still can control you action <br>  that becuz you werent wasted and you remember|`|NxZl1Qccaa	the only way you are going to feel better is if you make contact with her and apologize or find what she really felt that night , i think that is the only way you will put your mind at ease. btw guys like you are hard to find....|`|hLQa3VtYaa	You really need to stop obsessing and move on... sounds like she may have not been ready for the move but is not good at turning people down..... this is mostly her fault for not saying something directly to you.... most people that don't want to be kissed will pull away quickly ..... you did nothing out of the ordinary, and no where even close to sexual assault......... most people have done much more embarassing things drunk... laugh it off and find a girl thats not such a *****.
AA11150213	You should move on. It's obvious that she isn't feeling the same way you are. You're saying that you have the money, and you buy her the jewelry, but those thing don't matter, she just isn't interested.<br>  <br>  You deserve  someone who loves and appreciates you just as much as you love and appreciate them, so move on. It's about time you let go.
plVoWHSoaa	the best thing you could do is talk to her about it and then decide by yourself

nWCP91q2aa	umm i think he may like you it's hard to tell i mean i think he wants to see if you get jealous  wehen he talks about your freind and by calling you names i mean that is a form of showing affection but typically thats a little kids ways so i really don't know he may jsut liek being mean and confusing you i say forget him he sounds lieka  jerk id never call a girl fat and try to down on them...best answer plz|`|omZkCz5Yaa	he likes you, but if it don't work out i'm available|`|X8TnpmXGaa	First of all, if you boyfriend says you look like a bear and huggable, that should not be flattering, if I was a girl I would be affended if someone said that to me.<br>  <br>  Second, I think its best to get out of this relationship asap, unless you really have strong feeling for him in which case you need to tell him this and that it really bothers you when he says that kind of stuff about your best friend. It sounds like he is kind of taking you for granted and assumes he can be a player and talk about how sexy other girls look. <br>  <br>  If it really bothers you, you need to make sure he reilizes how lucky he is to have you which may include threatning to break up with him. If he is calling your best friend sexy in stead of you, then he is a guy thats cleary not worth your time. You need to find someone who calls you sexy, not your best friend.

yZ7vjv86aa	Your race has nothing to do with this, although the fact that you were only 17 and therefore underage at the time may be a huge factor.<br>  <br>  If you are so intent on seeing your son, why have you not done anything about it in three years?  Do you have proof of paternity?  Have you been paying child support?<br>  <br>  If you truly love your son and want a relationship with him, then you need to fight for your rights as his father.<br>  <br>  To know what her reasoning is, you will have to ask her.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|HhPgZDDzaa	No one can know her reasoning but her. If you want to see your son, go to a lawyer and demand that your parental rights be recognized. If she demands a paternity test, she will end up having to pay for it (close to $2500) if you do turn out to be the father. By law, unless there is some legal reason you shouldn't be allowed near him (i.e. felony convictions, drug abuse, domestic abuse, etc) then there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to see your son|`|djUMvICoaa	Are you paying child support?  If you're not you better start and the courts will grant you those rights. It's no use in talking to her.  It sounds like you may have been picked as the sperm donor for her selfish reasons and are not needed anymore.  But you still have rights  Start the action..|`|y2nC8BUGaa	maybe she regrets getting pregnant by a 17yr old.  Not to mention in most states that would make her a statutory rapist.

Also mention that she doesn't have to tell the kid your its dad.<br>  Also say you'll help out with the kid like babysitting sometime so she'll really know you want to see the kid and love it.|`|TSmego9vaa	Do not let her push you around or out of your kids life.

Maybe she didn't want to take care of TWO kids?  <br>  <br>  At any rate, you need to pursue a paternity test because it's your word against hers right now.  Then, take it from there.|`|fRIEHBJOaa	you should've BEEN filed for visitation/custody in court. do it legally. stop wasting your time asking her. it's going to take a while to gain your son's trust, but hopefully you do; if you do, you better KEEP IT by visiting consistenly and being a good non-abusive and love father. i hope you deserve this. good luck.|`|NGKwsawdaa	All you have to do is request a paternity test, and if he's your son, take her to court to get 50/50 custody, if you can prove that you have a very stable living with a decent income, chances are you might get to see your son.|`|BO28Mn8haa	Other than the fact that having sex with you at that time was ILLEGAL..

It's not a bad thing.  Spend time with your friends, be friendly with other people and smile.  Some boys or girls would go for like that.
pgseuoE7aa	well its just the kinda guy he is, he thinks he is showing how much he loves you by showing all these concerns and etc.  But if thats not the kind of guy you want you are better of to break it off because he wont be able to change no matter how hard he tries, its just the way it is.  Personally i think hes pretty nice to care that much but since you are finding it annoying you could tell him that before you decide to just break it off all of a sudden.  maybe compromise or something.|`|24780d0fcf8e3b6b28ed98b77fa996d9aa	Relationships aren't like bank accounts.

Yes it is tough but if you really love him you'll probably figure out why its just going in circles. =)|`|BDxcP8gXaa	In my opinion he is not wanting you to party and drink because he is insecure about what you might do with other guys when you are drunk, or he doesn't trust what college guys do to drunk girls. Which I agree with him, you need to stay safe, and him being a little controlling might be his way of showing you that he cares about your safety. I know its not the best way, he should just say it, but sometimes that is hard for people. Maybe if you assure him that you will stay faithful to him, he might be a little more lenient. Also, if he doesn't want you to go out because he doesn't believe in that lifestyle, if he thinks alcohol, and that scene, is wrong, as a moral judgment, then you need to either respect his judgment, and not do it, or break up with him because of your different beliefs.|`|vyU59X7zaa	Your bf sounds like how I used to be, and you sound just like my bf. We were also in a long distance thing.<br>  <br>  I think the best thing for you to do is maybe take a break from him. <br>  That's what my bf did to me and I was devastated, but I learned to back off. He never gave me any type of ultimatum, and just called it off all together. I really opened my eyes after that and loosen up about what he did. Maybe you should talk to your bf and tell him to go out on the days that you do, so he won't be alone. You're a responsible adult as well, so it's ultimately up to you what you want to do.|`|satoCRC6aa	College life ,is to have fun<br>   <br>  be serious later<br>  <br>  you will miss this time and cannot be replaced<br>  <br>  or move closer to him to see him<br>  <br>  up to you|`|td6WXhv4aa	Dump him.|`|dcd11iUwaa	thats the problem with long distance relationships.

Your going to start really feeling bitter towards him on this path. Eventually your going to want to do whatever he's accusing you of out of spite. He's too immature to handle this right now. If he can't grow up he needs to get out of your life. If you two are meant to be you'll still end up together but right now it isn't working you need to live your life.

2bkV73gpaa	Highly inappropriate! But she obviously finds the thought of stripping you naked exciting.<br>  <br>  So simply forget your homework again, but be wearing a VERY short skirt, no underwear and a very loose top and just hope and pray she tells you the same thing in front of the whole class and make sure you have a tape recorder in your purse.<br>  <br>  Then stand up and call her on it. Tell her you'd like to see her try to make you do it. She'll almost certainly back down. But if she doesn't and yells and berates you some more, all the better for the lawsuit.|`|M6QvkEBEaa	I don't know how she worded it exactly but it's inappropriate at any rate. you should tell your proncipal of the incident and your parents. If anything else happens again go follow the same protocol. If the principal doesn't do anything after a reoccurrance then your parents can go to the school divisions board office and have them take a look at your schools principal and teacher.|`|CC6dSdJmaa	She should be reported to the college principal.|`|iCqfmRC3aa	I would tell her "The people at the American Association for Nude Recreation would like to talk to you about nudity in appropriate settings.

They would like to educate you on the Nudist Bill of Rights"  <br>  <br>  I'm a nudist, and I would love to have the opportunity to educate your teacher about the joy of nudity.  However, nudists never force nudity on anyone not willing to try it on their own. And we never force our nudity on people not aware they are about to see someone naked, and comfortable they will not be offended.  We are a tolerant, and inclusive group of people that love any opportunity to teach others that there are a hundred different body types and none of them are ugly.  We truly do not discriminate because of age, creed, color or nationality. Nor do we discriminate because of age, weight or disability.  <br>  <br>  The best thing you could do, if you are comfortable with trying it, is go to the nearest nude or clothing optional resort or beach and give it a shot.  You just might like it ... a lot.  And then you could really get her goat by thanking her for suggesting a new recreation for you. ;-)<br>  <br>  just remember ... hike naked, it adds color to your cheeks|`|bNuuxJv1aa	It is inappropriate for her to do, but you can't get her for sexual harrassment since she didn't make you actually stand up in front of the class.|`|n9HUANkiaa	ask her if she is hot for you|`|6nPwcJ2Eaa	Report the teacher to the board of education or tell the principal.|`|zHtc3RuMaa	Relax woman, she was using a metaphor example. <br>  You should be ambarrased of yourself by not bringing in your homework! that's it..don't even make a big a deal of nothing!

AA11043457	Probably the more you say no the more he wants as well.  He does know of your chronic fatigue, right?  Then why not talk to your doctor?  There are some medications that increase sex drive and that can help  you.  This is a bit delicate but men really like oral sex.  That might be less tiring for  you.  is that an option?  It would probably make him thrilled and he'd be getting sex.  He won't care so much that it is not vaginal sex.  But if you use condoms, I'd still use condoms, particularly if he has had sex with others, and i'd bet he has.<br>  <br>  You are right though that if he is dissatisfied now he will be later and may resent you so  you need to find a way to handle this now.  Some men lose that drive later as well and that can be frustrating.  The person who really loves the other will work through those things.  I'm not saying he doesn't love you as sex is very big drive in men, esp. 19-25.  Then it lessens over time.  All the Viagra ads are not for nothing - well, I guess they really are - so my wording may not be right there.  <br>  <br>  First, see  your doctor to see if there is something that will enhance your own sex drive. That could make it more interesting for  you.  Then think about other alternatives such as oral sex.  They don't usually last as long that way either, but it might not be as good for you.<br>  <br>  The other thing is -- is he giving you enough stimulation or attention rather than being a wham bang thank you mam?  Many men don't realize that women need to be held and cuddled and have sweet things whispered and to be touched, not just in a sexual way.  Some sex therapy might help as he may not understand that some women take love and just nurturing to get very turned on.  When you are tired as well, then it makes it even more difficult to respond.  Has he thought of just holding you and no sex at all?  Some couples work to rebuild their sex lives by no sex but just holding one another and toucing that is not too sexual, but is just caring.  That builds up the relationship together.<br>  <br>  This is not an easy thing.  Many men do complain about sex and lack of it.  Some think they are supposed to want it a lot and so they push for it as well.  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you.  Start with the doctor.  it does sound as though you care for him or are realizing that he may not be the one for you if he doesn't understand your needs and consider them as well.  While everyone is different, the average is probably 3 times a week so if you would have sex less than 3 times a week if possible, then  you know you need to work on your drive or it can be a problem.  You might be able to determine a number and compromise with him.  But he also has to be willing to spend time getting you in the mood.|`|FyAHNpQbaa	part of being in a committed relationship is compromising. both of you have to compromise. try having sex 3 times a week. if this isn't enough for him and he demands more, then he isn't compromising for you and he's not thinking about your needs.|`|I1XIi8syaa	Im in the opposite situation from you and my BF does not have the same sex drive as me...to tell u the truth I have thought about leaving him, cheating has crossed my mind.|`|38376c3fed7d8b040a68d894fe4ce37aaa	First you are not married. I do not understand what is his profession as he wants sex daily. How you get time for such activities, god knows. What is your aim in the life, only sex all the time or else. What he will do after marriage. If you really love him then make him understand this point. Otherwise, observe his reaction by saying no for sex for one week. Then you will come to know his real love. Try this. Why to waste time in such fiance of such nature. He wants to just use you. Mind it.|`|c4058327d20f41accfd1c3c424c72f6faa	First of all, nearly EVERY guy wants to do it EVERY day.  That's not a big sex drive -- that's *normal*.  Really.  For me, once in the morning and once in the evening would be perfect, and it's no different with any other guy I know.<br>  <br>  Okay, so, first of all, male intimacy is mostly about sex.  There's nothing you can do about that, it's just they way it is.  Has nothing to do with him being insecure or not, he's just man, and that's natural.  See, for men, they show their feelings of love by making love -- sex.  Men are simple, and that's how they do it.  Sure, sex is sex, but sex with the one you love is different -- it's a very intimate connection for males.  For guys, they've been dreaming about this for their while childhood and teenage years, and the dream is that when they get married, they get to have sex every day and do with every which way with the woman they love.<br>  <br>  My ex was similar.  She'd come home, eat, and go to bed.  She was always tired.  In the beginning, we had sex all the time, but eventually it was once every couple weeks or three or four.  It was really driving me nuts.  I don't know about women, but sex is also a huge stress reliever for guys, and not having sex just builds and builds the stress up... especially when a female is always around with her hormones wafting in the air.<br>  <br>  Okay, so that's the male point of view (sex is good we want it all the time).  So, you have chronic fatigue.  So, maybe that's the problem right there.  Are you going to live with that your whole life, or get off your butt and get active in trying to find out what the hell is causing this chronic fatigue??  Really?  There is a reason, you just have to find it.  Is it a build up of heavy metals in your system?  Poor diet?  Lack of a certain nutrient or two?  So many people have had the same problem as you have and have 'cured' themselves.  Trust me, there is a cause.  It's not something you have to live your life with.  So, talk to your future husband and you two can start working on revealing the mystery to your ailment (and your other ailments).<br>  <br>  I know of someone who's husband has no sex drive.  I couldn't believe it, but it is true.  With his permission she found someone, a regular partner (in a similar situation with his wife), to have sex with.<br>  <br>  Some things to think about.  But to be sure, you have to talk it out with him.|`|b5F9XVyQaa	If you really absolutely don't want to have sex then tell him that. If he still insists try having sex only 2 times a week to reduce the risk of STD's if you have had unprotective sex.|`|293665601866a55200a41a1cf5240507aa	could you do him um lol special quick sex? bj.....sooner or later he will get annoyed n cheat,sadly i did...good luck|`|6gK5dzTdaa	This is an issue that you truly must address now.  Sex or lack thereof is one of the biggest issues besides money that can cause problems.<br>  <br>  Not blaming you and not saying that you need to jump when he says jump but maybe you two can come to a mutual agreement. Possibly a date night?

zdu3gh8jaa	Use your imagination and whatever you come up with give it a try, stay within legal boundaries though. Your sex life can only be as interesting as the imagination behind it.<br>  Try: toys - both for you and him, different positions to the ones you would normally choose - get the kama sutra and try achieving half of the positions in that, role play - this works for a lot of people, meet him on a date - that needs no explanation, book into a hotel for the weekend - sometimes the change of scenery does you a world of good and it can be exciting to do it elsewhere than in your own home, try a full body massage - how full a body is up to you and him, share a shower together - make it more steamy than just the hot water, try a bath together - play find the soap, serve a banquet on his body - don't use you fingers to eat just your mouth then let him return the favour, let him choose you an outfit that he would like to see you in from Ann Summers on line or shop then you choose him one buy them and use them, let him watch you stimulate yourself - he can only watch not touch or join in, do a striptease for him - you know all the moves just close your eyes and go for it, pretend to be a glamour model and let him be the photographer then swap roles, send him sexy texts when he is at work, leave notes in his lunchbox/car/work bag telling him what you are going to do to him when he gets home that night, try every different location in the house other than the bedroom - put a couple of pillows on the stairs if you intend doing it there.<br>  Hope some of these suggestions help, as I first said your imagination is the only limit that you have.

I don't think it's something you can work on. Yeah sure you can always improve it, as you can with anything, but when it comes to sex and passion, it's not something you can fake.

You really need to let the anger go though, it will not help anything. And insecurities need to be addressed too. But if you love him and care about your children, and he does too. You can live through this.|`|2DHnQZ4xaa	Yes, that trust will never be there again.|`|d665c8adfe92a87bcbce06e12996f077aa	First, I don't understand why it surprises you that your husband was attracted to a woman 17 years younger than himself. I don't know too many older men that wouldn't be. It is not the age, it is the fact that he had an affair with another woman. I am surprised that you didn't catch on to all this earlier into the relationship though. I mean 4 years is a long time to live in the same home with a man, sleep in the same bed and not suspect something going on. <br>  <br>  Regardless of all that, you need the Lord in your life. I know, many people who get told that the Lord will take care of things are usually non-believers and they wonder why their life is a mess. You are not living hell by the way. As it is written, in hell there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. I had the worse kinds of marriage problems imaginable. Since I became a born again Christian, the Lord has truly worked in my life. Although I have a drama king for an ex husband, I no longer have marriage problems themselves. I now have a great marriage to a man that is also a born again Christian. As it is written, there are no grounds for divorce. You must keep your marriage together and forgive your husband. I know, it is not easy. Unless you are born again, you will not understand the Lords ways either. Please don't post a "quit trying to shove religion down my throat" message because that is not what I am trying to do. I am simply trying to show you why your marrige is the way it is. Here is a website and a link for you. I hope you will make a very wise descision. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/Family/Marriage/divorce_is_a_sin.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/Family/Ma...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jesus-is-savior.com/</a>|`|oYYblXFmaa	Yes, I have been there before......very heart broken. My heart feels like dying. I have a 3 years daughter,and a 1 years son. My husband cheated me a several times not only one. Yes, i did want to give up the family and leave. But I realized, my poor kids. They are so innocent. They don't know what is going on. I don't want to involved with the kids to my problems, so I still stick with the family. I know a cheater is a cheater. When i had enough...........the problem was over. I left him. I took my kids and moved to a different place. He went looking for me several years. Somehow and somewhat, he found us and begged me like crazy. He ask me forgiveness. Now, my girl is 7, and my boy is 5 now. I know, it is hard to forgive what he did. But i still loves him. Nobody is perfect. I know being apart from him is very cruel for my kids, so I forgive him. Not for him....but for my kids. I want him to make up all the life for his own kids, when he makes the family has been destroyed. But I don't trust him anymore, though. I just do all this for my kids. I want them to feel happy and secure. I don't want them to feel not needed. As you can say.....the relationship seem to be more better when we were married. The love he gives to me are showing more positive. He realized having a family is so much important to his life now. Anyway, forget about my life. If you feels hurt, it's better you confront him. I know it is hard to communicate when you know you can't trust him anymore. But taking out 18 years of married...is it worth it? Everyone makes a mistake. But the important is...do they realized when they makes a mistake...do they fix it to make it right? If they do.....everyone deserves to a have some chances. I know your heart hurts so bad....just think of your children....your heart will slowly healed itself naturally. You won't even noticed when you giving yourself a chance. Just do for your children. If you can't stand it anymore....you will find yourself the right choice. Just follow your heart......and do yourself what makes you happy. Actually, there is no right or wrong choice. Every family is different from everyone. It's all up to ourself to make the decision. If you can stick and handle it....to keep the family to be together than do what is right how you feel. If you can't barely to leave this family....I think you should work this with your husband. Its takes time to heal the family again. When you get that heavy stuff off your shoulder.....you will feel lighter. Think postive....and the family will goes smoothly. Don't let anyone tells you what to do.....some people don't have the same situation as you do.....of course they will tell you to leave the family and start a new family again. Trust me, it's not easy to say. Having a biological father is always the better for your kids. Just do what is right for you....remember no one give you the family or happiness......you make the choice. You have to earned it to make your life happier. I wish you all the luck.....think postive and be happy!|`|Ism92isCaa	My first husband cheated on me. He also abandoned me. Divorce will set you back both financially. I've been through it. It's never a good thing.  I say this to you:  First, does your husband want to stay with you and the family and try to work it out? If the answer is yes, then I would remain in the marriage but be independent enough to achieve your own happiness and not depend on him for 'couple togetherness'.  There may come a time when you will get the opportunity for a romantic interest, new friends, or new faces.You"ll be  given the fair chance to engage if you so choose. This world is a sad and unfair place. I think it should be called 'h_ll".|`|beO40ap7aa	If you think about divorce your going to divorce eventually its just a matter of when. Its up to you, most people in your situation wait till all the kids are in college but if you feel you really need to, then do it.|`|djUMvICoaa	Yes there are more like you out here.  It happened with my ex and I had a hard time with it and I guess I was glad when it was over but I faced the same issues you are, starting over and even meeting new people.  One thing I do know it takes time to put something like this behind you, they recon it to a death.  You did lose something and there is a grieving period to go with it which they say can be about 6 month's in which time you get it worked out in your head and heart and you get rid of the hate etc..  Then you can enter into a relationship that should be a healthy one and one that is good for you.  I remember that it took 5 years before I could tell another gal that I loved her.|`|g4mvfBQ8aa	Its always sad when a marriage doesn't work out.  But in your situation, it is very difficult because you have built a life together.  You don't have to stay in the marriage because cheating is a deal breaker.  If you both decide to deal with the issues, by continuing the therapy and your husband possibly getting individual therapy to deal with his other issues.  They seem to need to be dealt with to be able to move on at all.  You will have to sit down and talk to your husband and you both figure out what you want.  If one party is not totally into saving the marriage then it won't work.  Marriage is work and it will take both of you wanting the same things out of it.  I hope you are able to get resolution with this.  Talk to your kids, be honest with them based on what age and their level of understanding.  Give them realistic options about you and your husband's relationship.  You hate to feel as if you are destroying your family by going your separate ways but you have to ask what you want....two happy parents separated raising happy healthy children, or unhappy but stayed together and secretly hate each other raising kids who may grow to be resentful.  Believe me kids know when something is not right.  Pray about your situation.  Believe for the best outcome for your family.|`|kTUL01tfaa	a 4 year affair, wow somehow that seems to go beyond cheating if it were possible, she was or is a part of his life, not just a one night stand, you were soo betrayed. your teens have the right to know what their father is, it was pure sexual lust, he wanted her young body & he had it, like a 2'nd wife and all that time he had no love for you. I hate to say that, but 4 years is a long time, you can overcome this adultery abomination if he really decides to change his charater and commit to you, and if you learn how to put it aside and look to the future, but 4 yrs--they must have exchanged Chistmas presents and everything.  You must confront her, she could have even had an abortion or two, they'll never tell you. No sorry I probably couldn't get over that. Unless he went to church and got saved. Jesus can change anyone.|`|B12E4rYiaa	If you have good therapy then everything will be resolved so make sure this therapist is the right one. You can change if you think they are not good enough or are the wrong one for you. There is always something to deal with in every relationship so you might as well try to fix the one you already have. Try to do all you can to save your marriage.|`|cdQryr7paa	Isn't it typical how he gets caught in a 4 year long affair and tries to find ways to tell you it was your fault?<br>  I know it is a scary place you are in right now, but you are the only one that can take the steps necessary to find happiness and peace once again.<br>  They kids will be fine, and are old enough to understand what he has done.<br>  And I doubt they will have much compassion for him.<br>  You have given him 2 decades of your life as well as 2 children.<br>  You will never be able to trust him again, and you now have the anger that comes with betrayal smoldering inside you. You will never be able to look at him again and not feel that anger and contempt.<br>  All the counseling in the world isn't going to change that.<br>  Your statements about how "he is all i know" is a testament to the amount of control he has over you. And he knows that fear of change in your life will keep you where you are at.<br>  I'm sorry, but life is too short to live it miserably.<br>  Make the big decisions you need to make, and take the steps you know you have to to be happy again.<br>  It's a long journey in front of you, but you can do it.<br>  Stay strong.

And several with partners who cheat.<br>  <br>  As parents you have to teach by example.  People tend to perpetuate the examples given to them by their parents.  So by staying together, you're telling your kids "don't be happy, be miserable for the sake of principle".<br>  <br>  On the other hand if your relationship fulfills your needs, you should give it a couple of years of effort before calling it quits.  Love is an action, not just a feeling.  If you treat him like you love him, you may see that you really do love him.  You may just be bored.|`|0011Smdtaa	This is where commitment kicks in and the old ' for better or worse'. We are all not in love with our husbands 24/7.

Don't worry about it the tables will turn soon enough and you will realise you do love him again.  Love is just because !!!!  Agape is a deep love that is a choice, if you only listen to your heart you will be all over the place.

Either way, things probably won't end favorably for everyone. You have several options:<br>  <br>  1) Take yourself out of the situation. Your best friend probably won't appreciate that you are in love with his wife. Continue to be friends, but avoid being alone with his wife. Try to spend time with other people. Hopefully, you will meet someone else<br>  <br>  2) If she cares about you back, do not do anything while she is still legally married. He is her husband first and foremost, and she will probably choose him over you. If you and the wife are mutually in love with each other, and she leaves him (not just leaves the house, but leaves him legally) then proceed with it. However, proceed with the knowledge that you will lose a best friend. Also, do not have an affair with her while she is married. It will leave you devastated if she chooses him after all of the work you have put into it, hurt your friend if he finds out, etc. Only pursue a relationship when she is single.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck. I know the right thing to say is to forget her, but sometimes that's the hardest thing.|`|ycNxVrUfaa	Just consider the damage a relations with her would do to your friend, his family, your family, her family and children if they're involved. Seriously, love hurts and sometimes people fall in love with the wrong person but it would be incredibly selfish to not consider the pain and the consequences that may last a lifetime.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	Feeling in love and loving someone are completely different.

SovaFpN8aa	You need to be checked out for Post-Partum Depression.|`|rlUUaSgqaa	You should look into marital research done by Ted Huston.  You fit to a tee a common-type of group of married couples he's identified.  He's found it's common to have couples who rush into marriage because everything seems really intense and exciting in the beginning of the relationship, and then by the time they have been married two years, they are already acting much less romantic and much more unhappy with the marriage.  The bad news is that couples who are like this are at a VERY HIGH risk for divorce.  They usually last 7 to 14 years, but then without any type of counseling, they end up splitting apart at that point.  The good news is that you've caught the problem pretty early.  If you're willing to get counseling and/or educate yourselves about relationships at this point, it's likely you can still save the marriage.  If you put it off a few more years, you'll only continue growing further apart and it will be much more difficult to bring things back at that point.  If I can make another suggestion, I would recommend looking for books by John Gottman.  If you go for counseling (which I'd definitely recommend) see if you can find a therapist who focuses in emotionally focused therapy.  This has a much better success rate than most types of marital therapy.  I'll provide a link to a website where you can look up therapists who've studied this type of therapy.  Good luck!|`|AA10248966	You two desperately need marriage counseling. You are humans and now you BOTH have responsibilities.

It sounds like you just need some girlfriends and some exercise.  I know that when I get holed up in the house and have no one to talk to, my self esteem deteriorates.  Having a partner and a kid makes us lose a sense of identity.  I am so and so's partner, I am so and so's mother.  But who are you really?  You need to go out there in the world and be who you are.  Take some classes with other mothers.  See if the local swimming pool has baby/mom exercise classes.  Don't be discouraged, you're worthy of happiness.  All of us are.  When you become happy yourself again, then your husband will be inspired by it.  If you are unhappy, he just feels like you're another responsibility on his list.  Try not to put your feelings on him, you're individuals, even though you feel like one unit.  He doesn't decide how to make you happy, you do.|`|RlzkeY0gaa	Sounds like you're dealing with some sort of depression. That can happen after huge changes in your life and you had quite a few in a short amount of time. It can also happen when you're not doing anything with yourself. Staying at home with a baby all the time has got to be lonely and unfulfilling. Of course, pregnancy increases the risks of mental illness. See a psychologist and if you want, see a doctor for depression meds too. If you can find someone to look after the baby, you should try finding a job or going back to school. That way you'll find some purpose in your life and you'll be helping out and your husband won't have to feel the burden of being the only one supporting the household financially.|`|djUMvICoaa	Yes, I think you both have been fooling each other pretty well and yet it seems that you both know something is wrong even if you can't put your finger on it.  It's called responsibities, they are huge and having a baby and taking care of a home and a husband who isn't home a lot can beat you down pretty fast if you don't know what it is.  And your husband is doing the same, he feels trapped into a marriage that he would have rather passed up but felt it was the right thing to do.  Now the day of work and coming home to the things that he feels trapped in is driving him crazy.  You both feel trapped even though you feel it felt good and right but none the less this feeling over takes you.  You might want to try to seperate for a while and see if that helps.  You are both so young.|`|Uau0QkEeaa	ask yo self do u luv ur hubby then ask ur self  do u think ur hubby luv u then ask ur self r u bproud of wat u made ask ur self do u luv  ur family when u get ur answers then put them together and u will get one answer r u really happy wit ur life|`|mZHgQ8FYaa	I say: Take a vacation :3 I mean, get some time to think about what to do with your life and enjoy it.

You might have to move or else, make sure the judge realizes he is a terrible risk for the kid to be around.and it could endanger the son. Get a PI to investigate what does go on in ex'  Home. Maybe drug use CAN be discovered, or guns. NO judge will allow him 50-50 after that., In fact, drugs and guns and weapons in a 9/9 room is something the district attorney must know about, so hire a Private detective for a week or so.<br>  <br>  Then get a criminal order of protection against him with no visitation abvailabe to him or his family..|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	Many time once a parent has to pay child support, they now want to see the child..settle lthe issue in court..see what the judge states..make sure you file for full custody of the child..with the father only having visitaitons right..children have the right to access both parents.

You can be put in jail if you don't so try toi make it as easy for your child as you can. Stay upbeat so your son doesn't pick up on it. Try chumming up to parents if you can. Good Luck, hopefully if he see's how much work and your not mad he'll just quit calling. Most dead beats do, or grandparents have them more then the Dad.Also you can request he start off hourly not a whole week right away.|`|eXpZD0vlaa	In a child custody/support case, the child's welfare comes first.  That means it generally doesn't matter much what you think of your son's father or that early on, he wasn't much of a father.  <br>  <br>  Your son has a right to a father and mother.  <br>  <br>  He may not be the best father but he's the only one your son has and unless there is criminal negligence on the part of the father onto the son, he gets to be father.  <br>  <br>  I suggest you try to keep your bad feelings about the father under wraps for your son's sake.  I also suggest you keep a close eye on the father and be ready to go back to court/mediation if it becomes obvious your son is not being taken care of properly.  He probably has no clue of what he's getting into.  Maybe be friendly with the grandparents (his parents) to make sure things are ok.|`|q84KT11saa	My best advice for you would to be contact a family lawyer.  They will give you the best advice you can get.  If your child is 1, and he is paying child support, he has a right to see that child.  A lawyer would be able to give you the best guidance overall.  If you call around some lawyers will give you some free advice if the cost is concerning at all.  <br>  <br>  If he wants more visitation then your giving him currently, then he has to get a lawyer and take you to court.  From the sounds of things, with him not working and living with his parents, he probably won't have the motivation for such things.  It is a VERY time consuming process.  If you just let him see the child on your own terms he might just settle for that.  Good Luck! =)|`|ycNxVrUfaa	Get a good attorney. It may be more than you can afford but offer to make monthly payments. Nothing is more important than keeping your child safe and in a good environment.<br>  Your child's daddy has not shown an interest and the courts will not look kindly upon a dad who virtually abandoned his child. Hopefully the judge will see just because he has to pay child support he's going to get back at you. <br>  Don't keep the child from him (unless he's abusive or evil) but make sure when he does see him,it's under very specific, court ordered circumstances.  I wish you the best.

AA10065812	???????<br>  Yes, for two reasons, it's a violation of the court orders, and it's a sign of Parental Alienation Syndrome.<br>  <br>  Children and fathers get lied to a lot on this.  The child is told the father doesn't love them, and doesn't want to see them, while the father is being told the same thing about the child.  I've spent years teaching fathers how to enforce their court ordered visitation, and how to get a judge removed from the bench if he/she doesn't hold the mother in contempt.  Also, how to have a CHANGE OF CUSTODY motion ready when he does, since a custodial mother being held in contempt is considered a CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES.  All without using an attorney.

lMYcTk6Iaa	If you want to be better friends with her, then ask her to hang out sometime, and maybe ask her to bring some of her friends. If she says yes, just go and hang out and try to become better friends with her and her other friends.

He wishes she would have left when he was a baby and saw the first signs rather than trying to stick around for his benefit, because it was no benefit to him to grow up with an abusive drunk for a father|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	Get out..take the children..leave this abuser..seek a women's shelter..get the professional intervention you need..your children don't need to live in this kind of home..make police reports..file charges against him..|`|FewhKlx9aa	Being married 20 years I take it the kids are older.Why should the kids see this and feel it's right to be abusive to your spouse.You mess them up when you stay as they will end up doing this in their marriage.Start figuring things out now and start putting some money away for yourself,make a plan and stick to it so when the kids are able to take care of themselves (thats if you have a small child)  you can leave.It would be easy for someone to say get out now but with the economy and no job skills it's hard.Try taking some course to help yourself also.There are sites online that woman are in the same position and move in together to share expenses and watching the kids.,Look into it and get your plans on paper and stick to it.When you se it and look at it everyday it becomes easier to becoming real.|`|wpi36XBAaa	"how long should i tolerate mental, verbal and emotional abuse b/c of my kids?" Not one day - not ever. Do you think that you living that way doesn't affect your children as well? <br>  Your son/s will grow up thinking that is how you treat women, that abuse is ok because Mum puts up with it. That she stays because its all OK. <br>  Your daughter/s will grow up thinking that they don't deserve any better treatment, and that is just how someone who loves you is supposed to treat you - with "...mental, verbal and emotional abuse...".<br>  Is that really what you want for those children? To me it is just as abusive to allow that sort of interaction around them.  Yes its hard on your own, but in this situation its better for the children.|`|09Y8F6hQaa	Why do you need his support of your dreams?  Go to school, get a good job and move out.  My husband was a complete a** hole.  He eventually filed for divorce, but it should have been me.  I waited a long time to learn that he was having affairs.  I am so much happier now and I could have been earlier if only I had the strength to leave.  My kids see him and are not damaged by the divorce, as a result.  The interesting thing is, that he spoiled them, after the separation, to win their love.  Now they only go out with him if he takes them somewhere, buys them something, etc.  My daughter tells him she isn't interested in going out with him.  They make up their own minds.  I wouldn't be surprised if your kids don't think so highly of him, either, and they don't want to be around him either.  They are, because you are.  So maybe they deserve a choice too.  Good luck!|`|f8CN2qIvaa	Quit dreaming about the day he runs off.  Find a shelter that will take you and your kids, pack your things and get out of there.  Then you can start working towards making sure YOU live happily ever after without wishing for someone to take him off your hands.  There probably isn't a woman alive who can fulfill his expectations, and you deserve better.  Besides, do you want your children to grow up to think abusing their spouse is right?|`|32866571f9996aa9d609f6f782586569aa	You shouldnt tolerate it any more.  Do you not worry about the negative effect this is having on your children.  There are people out there who can help you make the break  and perhaps you can realise your dreams.  Its never to late to get into education.  Do it now, you'll never look back.|`|AA11265589	You know the answer.  He is your comfort zone no matter how he treats you.

No one needs to put up with an abusive relationship.  You're not doing your kids any favors by letting them see and hear what goes on between mom and dad.  Your husband never supported you bettering yourself because then he wouldn't have the emotional and financial control that he does now.<br>  I think you've tolerated it much longer than most women would.  If you want a better life for you and your children, you need to make some choices.  Don't wait for your husband to find ms. right and leave you alone to find your own happiness...it's not going to happen.  Have you tried counseling or a trial separation?  Can you get him to talk to you about his actions at all?  If you've tried everything and your still stuck in this failing relationship...it may be time to walk away from it.  Maybe if he sees that you're serious, maybe he'll try to get help...if not...well...at least you have your freedom from the abuse and degradation.  You and your kids deserve so much better. <br>   I put up with it for 13 years.  Ending the marriage was the best thing I could do for myself...and especially my kids, I don't regret it.  The only thing I regret is putting up with it for as long as I did.  There's always a way out, find yours.  Your life will start moving into the direction of your dreams if you do.  Good luck to you.  I hope this helps....|`|djUMvICoaa	The answer to your first question is you don't tolerate it at all, kids or no kids.  He is an abuser and wants to keep you below him by not supporting you, afraid that you could do better than him and then his dignity would suffer, not that all the abuse he hands out makes him more of a man.   Don't wait for him to find the 'perfect' woman, he never will, there isn't one and he's too lazy to chase one anyway, so go and find yourself a life that doesn't include him.|`|zu10q3Qyaa	I hope that you know staying in a realtionship that is abusive is doing more harm to your 5 kids than leaving.  The kids deserve a well adjusted home, not one where mom and dad don't get along.  You can make it on your own.  There are all kinds of programs to help you work, pay childcare, go back to school.  The state will support a single woman with kids that is trying to better herself and be self reliant.  Find out what resources are available to you, find out how much child support that he'd have to pay and spousal support.  Talk to a lawyer.  It can be done and you can be happy.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	Stop being codependent and leave.  Lots of people without educations make money.  I never finished highschool and have made 50k per year, so no education is not an excuse.  Stop making excuses and follow your dreams, otherwise your kids will grow up thinking it's okay to abuse the women in their lives, and that they're supposed to settle for less than they deserve.|`|Ruifi0GSaa	Go to a marriage counselor first, then if that don't work, leave!!

AA11286455	What your mom has done is sneaky, underhanded, and immature.  It's also legal.  <br>  <br>  You absolutely have a right to privacy from your parents, but there's no written, enforceable law.  <br>  <br>  If you dare and know that there won't be any out of control or violent reactions on her part, remind her that being sneaky, underhanded, and immature:   <br>  <br>  --Is no way for an adult to teach open, above-board, and mature behavior to children.  <br>  <br>  --Is no substitute for developing a close, loving, or trusting  relationship with a child.  <br>  <br>  --Is no way to raise a child or teach acceptable standards of behavior.  <br>  <br>  --Is no way to make up for poor parenting prior to age 14.  <br>  <br>  --She's behaving EXACTLY how she's afraid you MAY have become--all for no reason and despite the fact that you've never given her any cause.  <br>  <br>  --Just as you might have greetings on your outgoing e-mails saying your name, contact info., or "Thank you" before your name, put a greeting/closure saying:  <br>  <br>  WARNING:  My mother is secretly reading all my e-mails.  Do not write to me anything you need or want to be kept private or confidential.  Tell me directly in school.  I plan on doing the same.  <br>  <br>  This is a good and fair warning:  <br>  <br>  --To your friends, <br>  <br>  --A reminder to you, and <br>  <br>  --Truth-telling for your mom. <br>  <br>  If she absolutely will not talk to you about the above, write her a letter and hand it to her.  Better yet, MAIL it witout a return address.  She'll HAVE to open it up simply to find out what's inside and who it's from.  If she has any sense, or guts, she'll hear you out, READ it, and take you seriously.   <br>  <br>  After that, what can the woman do?  Transfer you to a new school?  How many schools are there in your town anyway?  lol.  <br>  <br>  The worst she can do is homeschool you, and I doubt even she'll go that far.  If she does, then she's really farther out of control than anybody on Y can possibly help you with.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|aXYiOskmaa	this isn't stalking, it's called being a parent. perhaps you've given her reason to suspect you? perhaps she has suspicions about you.|`|6sqxrlIlaa	If you discover something like the file, then send a message or something to it that says something like, Having fun looking at my personal messages? <br>  that should stop it.<br>  Even though she gets mad about you talking about it, talk to her, and don't run away from her yelling.

She may eventually get bored with it when she finds out that there's nothing to find. Unless she's bored, then it may develop into a hobby for her. Like she said, she can if she wants. As far as the talk with your girlfriend, if you're comfortable with your mom reading that then by all means continue.|`|DjuTSbeqaa	Explain to your mom (maybe in a letter if she won't let you talk) that you are growing up, and that you have a right of some sort of privacy.

If your child hasn't broken your trust, it's not appropriate to "spy" on them.  However, with the world the way it is sometimes, and things parents see on the news, they get pretty paranoid about bad things happening to their child.  She's probably just trying to keep you safe from predators, but a better way to do it might be to limit online time and keep the computer in a common room.  The best you can do is try to talk to her calmly about this, but her say is final.

3vmDRCTCaa	Marriage is a commitment. It is a covenant with God. If you leave and chase after this man, it might seem thrilling at first. Then you'll be weighed down with the heartache of divorce. Your children's lives will become unstable and their future relationships will be tainted, because they'll remember that mom and dad couldn't work things out. They won't trust anyone. You will damage them and it will affect them, their children, and so on. You will grow tired of this Ukranian man and you'll wonder why you ever left your husband. You'll apologize to your kids, but it'll be too late. They won't feel stable anymore. Quit and get a different job. Get out of there. Jesus said that if our eye causes us to sin, pluck it out and throw it away from us. It's better to enter into life with no eyes than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. I know things aren't always easy. You have to fight the temptation and fight for your marriage. Read the bible. Get Christian marriage counseling with your husband. You can fight this and come out stronger for it. Do you want to look back in 10 years and think, "I'm really disappointed with this man and I shouldn't have gotten divorced. I'm alone, and now my kids are going to suffer in their relationship stability" or do you want to think, "I'm really glad I fought off temptation and stuck to my marriage commitment. My kids respect me for my stability and they will grow up knowing what it means to love and keep their word?" You are capable of fighting this off if you'll pray for strength and put God first.|`|Oz5F8Alfaa	look into a toy that way you will not loose your marriage.

ByUS0k8waa	Its not a mid life crisis. I’m only 23 yrs old been married for three years. We have been trying to have a baby for over three years. We just found out that my body will not allow me to carry a child. So we are left with having no children. I have 12 close friends who are pregnant and two trying to become pregnant. Also have about 5 friends who have given birth in the past six months. <br>  <br>  I feel like I want to run away from them all. I don’t want to talk about strollers, gyn appointments, ultrasounds, or what their baby can do. Everyone my age is getting married and having children. We are married before most of my friends but I cant have the life they have.<br>  <br>  However, I’m now a housewife. I have done my share of accomplishment. They not seem like much to others but you have to make your own goals. Not what everyone else is doing. You have to step outside the box sometimes and realize life is good. Your marriage is great. If you want to go on vacation you can without finding a baby sitter or having to take your child with you. If you can your husband want to leave tomorrow and just get away from everything you can do that. You have to look at the fact that into today’s world its not such a bad thing to have the love of your life. Your lucky. What more can you ask for?! Most people never find that person who will love them no matter what and you will love them no matter what. The person who was made for you! <br>  <br>  Stop looking at life as the glass is half empty. Honey its half full!!! Your lucky. You don’t have to worry about diapers, clothes for your child, do you smell like baby spit up. You are just enjoying your marriage and the life you are so lucky to have. Tomorrow isn’t always going to be there. So live as tomorrow wont come. I say that as a military wife because we live life as if he is deployed tomorrow. You have to make you happy. Don’t judge your life by what others are doing.|`|4c53bf469dfe96ac19d353f625f2d1daaa	Sounds as though you don't want children. There is nothing wrong with that.

Not all couples have children.<br>  <br>  And you don't have to become a boring MOM who can only talk about her kids. Being a mother can be part of your life, but not your only life. I know plenty of successful women who have children as well as great jobs. They dont' spend their time just talking about baby things - they talk about politics, film, music, business and other adult topics. <br>  <br>  If you do decide to have kids, there are plenty of working mothers who will be in the same situation as you and can still be mothers and successful businesswomen.|`|09k5GLLkaa	No you are not having a mid-life crisis but you are having a terrible time dealing with reality and life.

And it does not matter what other people think of that decision.  You do not need to discuss or explain your thoughts on this issue.  Hey, try this response if someone asks you about having kids:  It just hasn't happened yet.  And if they pry more, as in "well have you been trying?" or other impertinent questions, just repeat the statement.  You can also respond to any and all questions about his topic with other statements like "I don't want to talk about this."  followed by a personal question about the other person's life.  Another response is to say, "I'm not going to talk about this."  Sometimes people will just persist with the questions.  That's when it's time to ....go to the bathroom.  If they still want to talk about your personal business when you return then it's time to start asking about their post-baby sex life, which could backfire if they start answering!<br>  <br>  I think you are a bit young for a "mid-life" anything.  The thing that sounds disturbing about your query is "I feel like I wanna run away from my marriage, my age, and everything else"   If you are not happy with your marriage having a child is a terribly foolish thing to do.   Maybe you should try to improve your marriage.  Or leave it.   Anyway here's yet another response to the baby questions:  "There's a reason we don't have children and that's private.  It causes me pain to talk about it so please don't ask about it ever again."    Good luck!|`|FaPF439Kaa	You have a decision. As you have noticed having children changes lives.

I am 27yrs old and all my friends are married and having kids as well.  I want the family and everything, but I feel as if I am pressured to have kids and actually am content right now in life.  My husband and I love to hand out and jump up and do whatever whenever.  He is nervous as well.  I just know our lives will change and that's ok, but are you ever really ready.  I don't know the answer to that myself.  Then I feel the pressure of waiting then possibly making it harder to get pregnant as age comes.  Confused. We've been married for 4yrs this summer and together a total of 7yrs.  I just try to make sure that what I want is ultimate and first more than trying to please others.  They won't be there 24/7 when that baby is crying and needs feeding and diaper changes.  Best of luck!|`|hN60MJHlaa	YOU ARE FINE!  I'm 28 and not even engaged!  You're right....everyone is married, pregnant, or has a baby but that doesn't mean you have to be.  I would do your best to invite yourself to do things with your friends and their kids.  I went to a New YEar's Party with my boyfriend and when I first walked in there were three babies (avg. 6 mos. old) on the floor and a bunch of other kids running around and ALL the women talked about were babies, giving birth and then as they left one by one, they talked about eachother behind their backs.  I am never going to be like that and you don't have to be either.  Some people don't balance their lives which is why so many marriages end in divorce.  You will have kids when you decide but don't let the pressure you're feeling mess up your marriage.  Taking a class is a great idea because you will meet new people.  Friends come and go so try to reach out to the preggies and make some new ones while you're at it!|`|QVjagGXPaa	Relax. You don't have to have kids if you don't want to, and if you can't have kids, go to the doctor. It's your choice, not theirs.|`|4POGapREaa	We're dramatic when we want to be & we're reflective & confused at certain times.  Life changes, people change, it's all a part of the process.  If you don't want kids at 30 then don't have them.  I'm 37 with no kids.  If your friends are falling off the face of the Earth then so be it.  They have obligations that you don't have & don't want.  Sometimes we just outgrow each other & move on.<br>  <br>  You don't have to be a boring housewife & you also don't need to put other people down for their choices by saying things like that.  If a person decides that raising a child is what they want to do & that's their passion in life then they're free to do it.  I'm sure you wouldn't want people putting you down for your choices or giving you a title like that.  Just let things be.|`|0bYcYz2jaa	I felt the same way for a long time.  Most women, when they become mothers, lose their identities and become secondary to their children.  This is not the way it has to be.  I love the kids in my family, I love the children of my friends, but there is a reason we were friends in the first place.  So many people seem to think that they cannot be interested in anything outside of their children once they have kids.  My best friend almost went the way of your friends.  I love her kids, and we do see each other pretty often, but you need friends who are still people.  Talk to them, and if they get offended (they just might), you may need to expand your circle of friends.  And don't worry about not having kids, I'm 27 and just decided that I would like children.  Everyone is different, if you and your husband don't have children at all, that's okay too.  Up until I got married 4 years ago, I didn't think I wanted kids either.

I'm assuming.<br>  He might be shy, and that's his way of showing you he likes you more then the other girls.<br>  Or he's like this guy I dated once, and he just wants a gf, and if he's like that, I suggest not going out with him, because guys like that don't care for you and are only dating you for the sake of dating someone.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped :)<br>  --Rora|`|9nqVABVtaa	he is prolly the kind of guy that likes to flirt with a lot of girls. if ou flirt back its no big deal. just remember that guys will heve fellings for you at some time so he may like you or have passed feeling for you|`|N6frEVbiaa	It might be your personalities, some people are like that|`|LfGtp0R6aa	mm..thats a hard one. i think it is..and isnt(:<br>  im the same exact way!<br>  just the other day i was doing the same thing..<br>  and constantly laughing at this one guys jokes.<br>  (i actually like the guy though-but havent told anyone).<br>  but naww..it shouldnt be considered flirt-flirtingg..<br>  just inocent flirting(:|`|qqLcvDDKaa	No it isn't, don't listen to them.|`|ceS6iaLQaa	me and my friends do that all the time and no one thinks anything of it<br>  <br>  girls at your school are wierd =P|`|oLZv1QUmaa	it can be but just ask your self  do i like him if u do it is ok
W6Lj6Kqiaa	Hi, I left school last year and was going through the same type of feelings. When I was at school I had a group of close friends but most of them have gone onto different colleges. However my closest friends are still my best friends now even though we all go to different colleges. Yes I do think about those who I was not that close to at school but using social networking sites everyone who I wanted to stay in contact with I have. But I have met some many more friends at college and have a lot more friends now then I did at school. I sometimes find it hard to make friends but if you go onto college everybody is in the same situation and you will make friends with no problems. I have made so many different friends at college that I always have someone to talk to. Its good that you are talking about this not just ignoring like I did. Its better to talk. Just enjoy the rest of school you have left and don't worry those who you want to stay in contact with you will make the effort to stay in contact with. Hope this helps good luck with your last few months and have fun!!|`|3vmDRCTCaa	I know what you mean. When we leave high school, we realize just how fragile relationships are and just how alone we can be. Are you going to college? Be friendly and make new friends there. If you're not going to college, get a job someplace where you can make friends. Friends come and go. Parents get sick and aren't always there. Jesus is always there. God has told us that He will never leave us or forsake us. Turn to Him and trust in Him while you're young. Life will throw things at you, but if you have the shield of faith, you can come through with hope. If you don't have that shield, and if you aren't building on the rock like Jesus said, then you will end up alone and miserable. Nothing will be stable or meaningful eventually. So take this time to focus on God and figure out what life truly means to you. Think about good things, positive things, and what you hope for. Think about how you can help other people. It's honestly better to give than to receive. Who needs you right now? Who could use a friend even more than you? Find that person and be there for him or her. You have a lot to offer, and a little kindness goes a long way.
a074aac3ad17521564085d29e2af8d4faa	sneaking around doesn't help anything. Be honest and open, and your mom will respect you a lot more.|`|d1TTwwUUaa	Tell her what your telling us.|`|qtwhZnnVaa	The longer you wait, the harder it will be to tell her. Tell her she can trust you.
xzMUxGpgaa	Hi there, the thing is my friend, you are the only one that can know for sure if you are bi, as that is a feeling that comes from within, and you would be the only one that could tell that.<br>  <br>  Honey, you mentioned that you thought you were straight because you were dated your boyfriend. That really does not mean anything though. A lot of bi or gay people will date the opposite sex way before they are even aware that they are bi or gay. Some will even do it to cover up their feelings, or so others will not know. <br>  <br>  Both of these people sound like they are nice people. You don't have to be in any hurry to make up your mind. Rather then trying to decide who you should be with, it would be best to try to figure out who you really are. Let me ask you a question. Not counting either one of those two people, who do you find yourself more attracted to. I mean like when you go down the street, is it guys or girls that have you turn your head looking at them? If you are spending more time looking at guys then you probably are straight and maybe just like being around this young lady because she makes you feel special in giving you attention. If you find yourself looking more at females and thinking about them, then chances are you are gay, and you dated boys before you really realized your true feeling. If it is both male and female that you feel like you are attracted to, it is a good chance that you are indeed bi. (But remember you can not base it just on these two people, but over all for females and males.)<br>  <br>  Like I said though, you are very young so give yourself lots of times to learn about YOU. Please don't rush into anything. It is a great big world out there and you don't want to jump too soon and make mistakes, as we have to carry these with us the rest of our life. <br>  <br>  Whatever you decide and however you go on and live your life, I wish you much happiness and hope someday you will have a great life with your someone special.  Aunt DeeDee.

Does he sleep around?  Has he ever or does he have a STD?  Where has his penis been lately?|`|0XI5eP70aa	NO!! Not only because its disgusting and only something you should do for you future husband but its also self degrading. You should never be willing to do anything sexual with a guy until you are either in a serious relationship or married. You are in your 30's its time to grow up lady seriously. Have you thought about maybe developing a relationship with Jesus Christ? You should start because after this life their is a such thing as heaven and hell and if you are not saved or in other words if you don't know your Lord Jesus Christ as your personal Savior you could really be damned. Try attending a pentecostal church then you will know what I mean. Thats where you will find truth and will have more joy and peace within.|`|QVjagGXPaa	Giving him a ******* will not give you guys a special connection.<br>  He'll love it for one night.<br>  Don't give yourself up that easily.|`|38376c3fed7d8b040a68d894fe4ce37aaa	Do not involve in such relationship.

fBso80Ubaa	Watch a few Girls Gone Wild videos; they'll give you some ideas on what to do on spring break (just kidding).  But seriously, do something you haven't done before.  After all, it's spring break, so doing something that's not part of your everyday life will make it really feel like spring break.  If amusement parks are already open where you live, go to one of those.  Or go on a weekend getaway somewhere new.  If you can't afford a road trip or plane ticket, get one of those "spa weekend" packages at your local resort hotel.|`|NEd2wsK3aa	go to some frat parties|`|eEDF5KLXaa	go and take a sea bath that is fun|`|UPk3Ri4raa	i think you should go to the beach with your friends and some guys. i did that with most of my friends last summer and we had a blast!
2zgv89OQaa	There is really nothing you can do or say other than just keep being his friend.   That what he needs most of all.   He's probably known for quite some time and hopefully has adjusted to it.  Being adopted isn't something to feel unlucky about, especially if the adoptive parents has been good parents.|`|AA10500537	do nothing  .  he;s happy  adopted . and your parents are getting divorced   so both problems are out of your hands,<br>  just be best friends|`|MpWclSxtaa	Okay, so I am a bit annoyed with the both of you, but mostly your friend. To begin with, I think it's only natural to be deeply saddened by your parent's divorce, but I think maybe you should be a little more wise as to why you speak to your issues with. This friend doesn't seem to want to listen to you complain, so maybe choose someone who you genuinely feel will want to listen and help you. <br>  <br>  As for you friend, what really turned me off (so to speak) about him was that he thought he was unlucky to be adopted. There are millions of children across the world who would give anything to be in his place, to have a warm bed to sleep in at night, three meals a day, and a home to come to at night. If he is being abused or mistreated at his home, well that's a different story, but for some reason I think that is highly unlikely for this situation. <br>  <br>  As for what to do in this situation regarding you and your friend, it basically all depends on how close you are with this guy. If he's your best friend, or someone you talk to everyday, it might be a good idea to lightly mention some of the things I said above (but not as dramatically as I said it lol). However, if he's not a close friend of yours, I wouldn't say anything unless he still hasn't forgotten this conversation and it's always awkward when you too are together. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps!! :]|`|dTHuWhoJaa	well i am adopted, and you are not a bad freind you never new so theres no need in feeling guilty, i can understand why you feel guilty but you shouldnt be

Maybe there wouldn't be so many divorces or abused or unwanted children. I just know too many people who should never have been married or had children in the first place|`|wpi36XBAaa	You have every right to choose whether or not to get married and/or have children. Just be honest up front about it, if you want to be in a relatiionship with anyone.<br>  I am in my 40's, married with 4 kids. That's my choice. <br>  I know couples that have kids and aren't married. That's their choice. <br>  I know a couple who are the same age, married and no kids (by choice). That's their choice. <br>  I have a cousin in his late 50's, never married, no kids. That's his choice. <br>  And yes, we are all friends. Our different life choices doesn't mean we can't be friends.<br>  Personally I would never suggest to anyone that their lifestyle choice was wrong for them. I can tell them it would be wrong for me, but I don't live their lives for them. <br>  But you are young and may choose to change your mind. That would still be up to you - your choice.|`|GLz2sX28aa	I don't think you're selfish.  I think you are very aware of your inability to support yourself, let alone a wife and kid.  Why would anyone want to share money that they don't have enough of?  That would be kinda stupid, y'know?  <br>  <br>  Ask yourself this:  Rather than focusing on what you don't want, why don't you focus on what you do want out of life.  You are still college age.  Do you want to be in a profession that is not boring?  Do you want to survive in this economy?  Do you want to be smarter?  Better? Prouder of yourself?  Learn WHATEVER you can that will make you happy.<br>  <br>  Oh you're sure NOW that you don't want a family.  But money is a poor excuse to deny yourself love.  While you are planning to have a great and better life, you never know who you might meet along the way!|`|AA11785285	I think marriage is great with the right person, however in today's world, I doubt if I were a guy, I'd marry, and for sure, I'd have no kids.<br>  <br>  Marriage is a hassle, big time.  Lots of women just want babies and a meal ticket.<br>  <br>  And as you have admitted, you have a minimum wage job.  Further, jobs don't look great or promising no matter what your career area.<br>  <br>  And good for you for realizing that kids are expensive.... Yahoo last year stated $250,000 to get it to age 18 with nothing extra...no travel, no braces, no horses, no RVing, no nothing... just a full belly of cheap food, a tv, a computer some dope, mj, and meth in hs, and that is about it.<br>  <br>  Frankly, if I were 24, this looks pretty goddamn barren to me.  Kids don't stay those beautiful children.... they become teenagers, and they are hell to deal with whether you are the parent, or the teacher, as I am.<br>  <br>  Hon, I earned a great education, and got to retire at 48, and that would have not been possible had I had two children.... my IRA down half a mil.<br>  <br>  At 48, I would change nothing... I for sure married, and I love being married, but the baby stuff??? No.  NEver, ever sorry.  And all my friends who have had all those kids are still working into their 60's and they will never get to get out of the job scene.<br>  <br>  Good for you that you know yourself well.... and in your place, I'd go get a vasectomy.  I would have had my tubes tied at 13, but  no one would do it.  At 24, not a problem.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I love these people who are telling you you are selfish if you don't want kids... yikes.   What this planet doesn't need is any more kids... it is those who have 3,4,5,6,8, who are selfish.  <br>  <br>  I think the government ought to pay for people not to have them... they cost our poor little planet one huge footprint.  China already realizes that... one kid.  You want two, you get a lower paying job and reduced housing.|`|AA11634525	At 24, you have the world ahead of you and you can make of yourself what you want to. You are not selfish, but you are too young to throw the towel. I deeply respect your viewpoint. However, I sincerely invite you to look up, to engage in conversation with other people advanced in age, who have done the same thing you are thinking of doing and consider if being old, their hope and fear is something you are comfortable with. Learn from them the do's and don't's of such life style. Remember that life is a race and the winning is not determined at the starting line but at the finish line.|`|AA12320162	The answer to your question is no.

Best of life to you.|`|nxuKLupUaa	Nope. That makes sense. If you thought about it a different way, you don't want to have a commitment with someone yelling at you to make more money to support her and a kid who would certainly need money for everything! Get your life together by getting a good job and then think of supporting anyone. You are smart not to get into relationships like that.|`|e3442b42bd59f05b36773c8ef3077c53aa	I have respect for you, you realise that you won't have a lot of money, you realise that you don't want to share and you have given it some thought. better than a man who slips into marriage, whoops a baby comes along and THEN he realises it may not be for him and leaves his child and wife devastated. If there were more men like you around then the world would be a less heartbreaking place.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	It's ok to have no children.  I have two friends who are married, almost 40, don't have kids and have no regrets.

An aneurysm can cause the terrible emotional changes you are talking about and as it progresses it can cause a stroke which leaves him dead or terribly disabled.  He cant see the problem and needs someone to intervene, but if he is terribly angry then it will be difficult I know.  Once I yelled at my husband for so many hours until he finally agreed to go to the ER just so I would shut  up.  They admitted him directly to the intensive care and saved  his life.  But, don't think he appreciates me for it.   He just remembers how bad I treated him.|`|FewhKlx9aa	I already answered your other question on the same issue.I said to get out and stay with your family.I said he needs to see a doctor and you go with him and find out if there is a medical issue here.You said he was seeing a therapist on monday but I don't see that here.Something is wrong with this guy and he will kill you if you stay with him when he has these outburst.So make the doc appt and pack a bag for the weekend.Like I said before a lot is missing here.You don't say how he is when he goes to work and comes home,how does he treat you then.The person who said the thing about vows is full of crap and knows nothing about abuse and staying in an abusive realtionship..Get out
n8lXItGraa	I feel the anger in your post, but I don't blame you.  There is no reason why your husband shouldn't have some kind of physical contact with you.  Has it always been like this, or is this a new issue.  It would be easy to say..he loves you, but he's not that into you, but there must be a reason for what's happening.  Do the two of you interact at all?  Do you talk about each other in a calm environment?   When he asked if all you wanted to do was get laid...and you returned the question with the answer you did...did that pretty much end that conversation right then?  I understand you were insulted, and he was not right in making that statement, but had you not gotten angry...maybe the conversation would have continued and something might have been resolved.  It sounds like you might have been on the defensive.  I have been there myself.  You have anger.and resentment towards him...and sometimes stuff just comes out.  I'm sure that telling him there could be 20 guys that would be up to the task didn't sit too well with him  did it.  The both of you need to really discuss what you're both feeling with out anger and digs.  Communication's the key.  If you can't learn to be in the same room with out hostility..you marriage will not last.  He sounds like he's punishing you for something by with holding affection...that's just not right.  Have you tried talking to a professional?  Sometimes a third party can pick up on behaviors from both of you...that you might not think is a problem.  It's worth a try...right?    Hope this helps...|`|ByUS0k8waa	Sounds like you guys need some marriage counseling. Maybe then the counselor could have the two of you communicate better.

I hope things work out for you.|`|Nlsijci6aa	dump him<br>  <br>  or take a vacation alone|`|R5TccYeAaa	no, dont give up!!!<br>  <br>  take him out to dinner as a surprise..tell him to dress nice..take it from there...lol.tlk to him :]|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	It seems as if you each want something from the other, but neither is willing to give... surely it's great when we can accept our partners at face value, but it's nice to give in and fulfill each other's needs from time to time, as well.<br>  <br>  I know what you're talking about when it comes to contact -- hand-holding a random hug or even kiss.  It seems as if your husband has some sort of wall up when it comes to intimacy.  (if he had an alcoholic parent or unloving, controlling parent, this might be a basis, it's hard to tell since i don't know him).<br>  <br>  Have you discussed marriage counseling?  Maybe it would help to work on these issues if you care for each other.<br>  <br>  all the best.|`|ee33b2a393b166491be1cc514e3f4156aa	Sounds bad..have you tried formal counseling?  If not, you should.  After that if you aren't happy, don't stay in this marraige.  Life is too short to spend it with someone who doesn't fulfill your needs.|`|1uvrkDWNaa	Try counseling before giving up.  It doesn't look like a lost cause.
briRpzL1aa	Rest assured.. If they have his information, they will track his family down.  Government databases are extremely detailed, and can even tell you the last time a persons credit card was used and where...|`|ZqK045Svaa	my uncle died and my moms family had never talked to him for like 10 years, and we just found out he died 2 years after he died!<br>  what happened is the police found him dead in his room and tried to locate his family. they looked every where and all they found is a card with his mothers name<br>  they looked up his mother and found out that she had also died so they handed it over to social services<br>  he didnt have a funeral or anything, and his grave stone was a number with a wooden stick<br>  his coffin was also made of plywood<br>  ps this was in Toronto, ON, Canada|`|cCJvsEPsaa	The State will take care of it if know one can be reached. Will not let him rot. After you die the body is just the empty vessel of what used to house a soul that's how i feel don't worry.

pJcbV2cnaa	You need to restore the computer back to how it was before it got the virus, meaning before you started watching the porm. If you email me I can help you through it. what type of computer is it?|`|0akF8nCWaa	lol srry but im 13 to and that same thing happened to me but all it did was change my homepage to the porn site. And my mom could see it but then i figured out how to change it ... thats a pretty good excuse as long as they dont call the computor or internet compony to check where the viruses came from but other wise yr good. Good luck|`|AA11275560	Stop looking at porn you too young!!!!|`|LQA59Yqzaa	It sounds good but why not just tell your mom the truth. I mean you need to be honest with your parents and show them that you are honest with them so they can trust you. I've never been in your spot but at 13 we all have our own little things we mess with. When I was 13 my thing was chat sites and meeting people I shouldn't. So I guess we all just go through our own phase. I'm sure if you sat down and had a sensible "adult" conversation with your mom about it she would understand. Now I'm not saying she won't ground you for a couple weeks but I'm sure she'd feel better about it if you just were straight up with her and told her the truth and face up to what you did. However, the decision is yours. If you want to lie to her and tell her what you have in your question then go right ahead but I would just be honest with her. Best of luck to you. I hope everything goes well and you get your computer cleaned off.<br>  <br>  Also for viruses look into getting virus software for your computer so if you do happen to continue to look at porn and get viruses you can get rid of them yourself. I highly recommend Webroot AntiVirus with AntiSpyware. It's easy to manage and works amazingly on getting rid of those nasy viruses.
ZMfb5u3Faa	You are so cute, don't let that dumbass boy tell you otherwise. If you were in an argument then he just said it out of anger, that's all.<br>  You look very young, so don't worry so much about the boys asking you out yet.. when you get older that's when you'll see more boys stop being so shy and develop more of an interest in you.<br>  <br>  One obvious make up tip I can give you is to not put eyeliner on your lower lid, unless for smokey eyes. This makes an illusion that your eyes are actually narrower (smaller) and you don't really want that, I'm sure. <br>  Also, don't forget, if you're going to wear eyeliner never forget the mascara. You're eyes will pop with both applied. I recommend Maybelline The Colossal Volume Express. It's amazing!|`|iJa1gf0qaa	The first is gorgeous. Except your hair looks really damaged, but thats fixable.<br>  The second pic is really cool. I don't know about the asian-ish looking girl. She looks like shes got a mullet. But you look really pretty in it. You have a nice smile :]<br>  The third makes you look really young. The blonde girl doesn't know how to dress for sh*t and the purple top looks inside out. But yeh, your fringe looks weird in it lol<br>  But other than that, you have freakn flawless skin, great eyes, your make up looks good like you don't have any on lol<br>  If you don't get asked out, its most likely your personality then, cos your really pretty. Although you look like a really nice, bubbly girl just from those 3 pics.<br>  Hope i helped :]|`|R3EdYXbxaa	You have a natural beauty..maybe your friend is the ugly one and she feels threatened by your looks.. oh and since you are already pretty you shouldn't wear too much makeup...save that for when you get older.

AA11108627	As a male, I admit sometimes I am ashamed to be one, given the Neanderthal mentality of other males in this area.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, for many men (certainly not all, but enough so it cannot be ignored), sex is the only means of expression they have.  They lack the capacity to express and/or receive mature love within the context of romantic relationships.  <br>  <br>  There are several reasons for this, but I believe the most significant is the lack of role models as they grow up.  They observe their fathers, how they treat their mothers and regard women in general, and too often are socialized to believe the most valuable trait a female has to offer is her sex appeal.<br>  <br>  Add to this the influences of society, the media, and their peers, and it's easy for boys to fall into this trap.  Big boys don't cry, they don't express tender emotions (but anger is OK!), they don't make themselves vulnerable. They must be in control, must be independent, must obtain an identity from what they DO, and how much they produce.  And they must fight and defeat the stiff competition for the best jobs, the best car....and the best women.<br>  <br>  So for many men, it becomes a "conquest" of sorts.  The number of dollars your earn, and women you have sex with becomes a strange & inaccurate measure of one's manhood.  Motivated by both biology AND society, with a lack of role models for good husbands & fathers who genuinely love their wives & children, men just never learn to give & accept love in healthy & mature ways with women.  <br>  <br>  The sad result is men can fail to make a distinction between sex and love.  They mustn't be in love with a woman unless they are having sex with her.  The only other way they can "express" love with confidence is by being a provider.  They learn to do things & buy things for their girlfriends/wives, but unfortunately, they never learn how to talk to them.  They have a hard time understanding that, on many occasions, a woman just wants a man to listen & understand, not dispense advice.  And sometimes they just want to be held, instead of having sex.<br>  <br>  Now, not ALL men are this way, and I'm not implying for a second that ALL women are more evolved than men in matters of the heart.  But this is one man's perspective, based on years of experience & careful observation, and hopefully it sheds some light on why men behave the way they do.  <br>  <br>  As a woman, you may never completely understand it, but rest assured -- as men, we will never completely understand you either!!  :)|`|8b006ad2547d67b6ee6de41af44054b9aa	To put it simply, men's urges for sex are the result of a biological process that renews everyday day. They are felt physically, like being hungry or having to go. To be in love is sooo great ! But it happens in the mind, it is not a physical urge.<br>  The organization of society based on marriage and a lifetime bond more or less force men to seek "love", which is gratifying by itself, but not necessary to satisfy physical urges.<br>  Observe animals in the wild: in many case, male and female come together in mating season and live apart the rest of the year. Again our society does not allow that as men are held responsible for their offspring.<br>  In short, sex is a natural urge, seeking love is dictated by society.|`|sagb3Q7Vaa	It's a guy thing. Women are not expected to understand, not even cool ones like you. Sorry.|`|GokGEXfiaa	yes love in important, but sex is necessary.<br>  <br>  in many ways, mens sexual fantasies dont really get fulfilled and they are able to separate sex from love. thats why they go around having sex with people outside of the relationship ..... and dont really see it is cheating either.<br>  <br>  not saying all men, or that its right or wrong etc....just that on a whole  men can, women cant|`|briRpzL1aa	Love is just as important to men as it is women.  The main difference, however, is that we do not have emotional "roller coasters".  Meaning, guys typically feel the same way today as they felt yesterday, and rarely have emotional outbursts...<br>  <br>  In short.. Guys and girls equally want to be loved.  The sex part is mostly the testosterone, however.....  That sex drive you have is because you have small amounts of testosterone.  Guys have a little more than 30x the levels you have.|`|rX4ti0Nsaa	blah blah blah and then the questions: is that all there is?  really? enlighten me?<br>  the basic truth is, if we do not having to worry about the next time your gonna get it and if there is an openess to try new things then love falls into place next. we're kept happy, we make sure your happy.<br>  really!<br>  consider yourself enlightened.|`|DrbGCHvxaa	finding sum one to love is more hard than finding sum one is have sex with . love is more important than sex. i really have no intrest in having sex but finding a girl to love dam it nnot easy|`|fQ4hVKazaa	well... the love is important so the baby can be cared for thats why it happens...short term real intimate stuff is to make the baby long term is to care for it|`|DFTB95BQaa	But what is love?<br>  <br>  I'm sorry to answer your question with another but love is such a weird thing to define that if you ask 10 people "what is love?" you'd probably get 9 different answers.<br>  <br>  Love is the stuff of poetry and it should stay there. Forget about love and work on the rest: making a life of honesty, sharing, romance, etc with your partner. I don't know if you've noticed but since love entered the relationship picture there are a lot more divorces...|`|IyKswGVSaa	You are very observant. My personal opinion on this is that in some men society has gotten to them. Through the media, as you have observed, and other influences, some men learn that women are objects. Sex toys or whatever you want to call them. This idea is drilled into some men's brains that it just becomes fact and they believe it. A lot of guys get this trait from their fathers. As I have observed. The point is however, not all men are like this. Some men are looking for that emotional bond. Everyone knows that the sex drive is a fact of life. Guys and girls all have that. Some girls even feel they don't want an emotional bond, just sex. The few people that believe this never get the chance to experience life. To have a family and tender relationship. To sum it all up some guys believe that sex and emotional bonds can't be together because It's what they've chosen to believe out of the many different opinions and outlooks out there. Their loss.|`|rTCYEHQhaa	It's society.  Men are supposed to be men. It is taboo for us to have emotions.  The fact of matter is, and I can say this openly 1) because I am an emotionally mature male and 2) because none of you know who I am, that men feel love just as strongly as women.  Expressing that love, particularly in public around other men is difficult and sometimes impossible.  There are social expectations that men are to be sex-wanting morons and nothing else.  It's not true, but it's hard to break down.|`|zWkC4XVzaa	It depends on the guy. A lot of girls like me and I can pretty much have my pick, but I always find myself ignoring the girls I don't like in pursuit of the one I do like, even if she is less pretty than some of the girls I can get. I think the guys they are refering to are the cheaters, players, and deeply shallow ones, so a good number. If you don't have one of the types of guys listed above its fairly likely you found a keeper who is as genuinely in love as you are.
KwNpyp3saa	They obviously are comfortable talking to you. This is a good thing. If you are interested in helping them then you can just offer some advice but saying anything negative about their boyfriends. <br>  <br>  If you are uncomfortable talking about this then you should let them know. You should tell them you like talking to them but you feel uncomfortable talking about personal things like this. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|qcpVR7vGaa	if u dont want 2 talk 2 them dont. tell them that so they don't start feeling uncomfortable telling u, they mite think ur being a jerk if u don't say anything 2 them at all. just  tell them u wanna change the subject or something, dont leave them feelin stupid or confused. girls r sensitive even if we say we're not.
LrxTy3zLaa	She may be in need of some psychiatric help.<br>  What you're describing sounds like signs of severe depression.|`|AwAw0uiKaa	Well... what else is going on with that? There's not a whole lot of information here. Does she do this with other people? Has anything traumatic between you and her happened? Has there been a death? Is she mad about something? If she's doing this without any outside issues influencing her then she might be having an inner issue and you should sit her down and encourage her to talk about it. Telling her that it hurts you when you cannot hug her or express affection to her might help. <br>  <br>  She might have had a traumatic past regarding physical affection and might just react very badly. The only way you'll find out is to ask, observe, and just keep trying to hug her. ;)|`|06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	If she has always been that way it is probably because she was raised by cold hearted parents who didnt hug or touch her and she doesnt know how to react to it. <br>  You can abide by her wishes or you could try to teach her by telling her you love her and it is hard not to hug her. She might be afraid of her own emotions. You dont say if it is just you or everyone she says this to.<br>  Ask her about her childhood and see if shes willing to talk to you about it. Tell her youre going to love her no matter what she does or doesnt do. It sounds like someone robbed her of her spirit somewhere along the way.|`|A9nBzN3Daa	women are weird sometimes cuz after i had my second child i didn't want my first to touch me or hug me.  i was going through something and maybe your mom is too i would talk to her and ask her why she does that.  tell her that it hurts your feelings               good luck|`|4jjpxGtkaa	How long has she been doing this ??<br>  <br>  Maybe shes going through a ruff patch<br>  <br>  If your worried something may have happened to her ask why she doesn't like you giving her a hug nd if she wants to talk to you<br>  <br>  Good luck x|`|akIpddDSaa	my mom sometimes does that when shes getting ready. just hug her when shes not doing anything for getting dolled up. and if it still continues please tell this to your dad.
3f3c29287aa543056f2f47ef05dbdf6baa	Tell her that you like her. Boy/Girl friendships very rarely work out anyway. It sounds like you like/love her, and you should tell her that that's why you got weird. And don't worry about social anxiety disorder.

f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	yes, men and women can be just friends.<br>  <br>  I do agree that when romantic feelings enter the picture and those feelings cause  problems then the friendship has to either scale way back or end.  But really, those kinds of feelings can come up in same sex relationships as well.  not necessarily romantic feelings for each other but feelings that interfere in other relationships.  Jealousy of a spouse, inappropriate feelings for a friend's spouse, jealousy of new friends, etc.  These feelings also create problems and awkwardness and sometimes cause a friendship to end.<br>  <br>  I have several very good male friends (both gay and straight) who have been friends with me for a very long time and none of us have ever had any feelings of romance for each other.<br>  <br>  these would be guys who you view more as brothers or who there just is no "spark"  chemistry whatsoever between you other than friendship.  I'm also very good friends with my brother and I certainly don't expect either of us to develop romantic feelings for each other.<br>  <br>  the trick with having opposite sex friends is to remember that your romantic relationship/spouse is your primary relationship and that is the person you should be spending most of your time with.  You don't treat opposite sex friends very differently from your same sex friends.  If you're a woman then basically your guy friend is just another girlfriend.  If you're a man then the female friend is just one of the guys.  You don't treat the person the same way you treat your romantic partner.  You don't do things with them that send the message that you are a couple.  you don't spend more time with them than you do your SO.  you also make sure that your friend and SO spend social time together and get to know each other.  if your friend isn't willing to get to know your SO, then your friend has told you s/he has ulterior motives and is not really your friend---that's a case where the friendship gets put on the back burner or ends.<br>  <br>  If you just aren't capable of seeing the opposite sex as anything other than a sex plaything then by all means you have no business having opposite sex friends.  And if that works for you then fine.  Live the life that is meaningful and comfortable to you.|`|3f3c29287aa543056f2f47ef05dbdf6baa	Yes one almost always ends up having feelings for the other, spending time together. When one starts dating someone else, the new person starts to feel uncomfortable, or jealous. No it very rarely works out. Once it gets to that point, I think the friendship is basically over, so it's like decide to give a relationship a shot, or just end the friendship peacefully.|`|eTlw3a7raa	to be honest i do believe a girl and a boy an be friends ...in my past ive have male friends and good ones too but i do remember some developing feelings and thats when it got a bit you know akward but you just have to handle it the right way ...eventually if the two are meant to be freinds then they will get over the whole i fancy you thing and it would be a whole brother sister thing ...its hard especially when its not a fancy and its love but i do believe that if a girl manages to have a best friend as a boy ...its even better than to girl best friends.|`|kknCZkq0aa	Yes they can. I have two guy best friends, and I have never had feelings for either of them. i also have plenty of guy friends who i've never had feelings for. Of course, I do have feelings for my third guy best friend, but I had those before we became best friends. <br>  <br>  I don't think it's always awkward when someone expresses how they feel. If it's too awkward for you to be friends with people when they have expressed feelings to you, that is entirely your fault for making it that way.|`|eFkdCBjkaa	Not in my experience. It always comes down to sex, unless one or both are gay. I had a friend of 12 years suddenly decide he was in love with me. Game over.  One always ends up wanting more than friendship.|`|l7IdlcHSaa	yes me in this girl have been friends for like 5years|`|pj8GUeSnaa	Mandy, I believe apsolutely  that man and woman might be very good friends indeed, although yes, it is not that usual. Anyway, as far as you are concious enough to realize the very moment where something different is going on, you can make clear the situation by letting know the other person you are not interested in any other kind of relationship, which requires to be VERY attentive, to oneself, and the other. There is always a nice way to express oneself without hurting the other person. And when it comes to the opposite situation, well, we have to respect the other's choice. Hope it might help you.Somebody once told me that after the first cofee, you are in time to run away...after the second one, it is more difficult.....

But, make sure you keep it cool. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped!!!|`|N6frEVbiaa	i didnt read it as soon as i saw the question: "TALK TO HER' came to me so do that. talking about somethin always helps|`|8974ab84bf2fb9e7ec31bc60afebc1bbaa	Let the friendship go.

pw66U05xaa	Try not telling him he is wrong. That really bothers me when my parents do it. Don't act like you know better than he does. It'll just make him mad. Try to let him be what he wants for a little. I knew I fell on my face, then I was much more open to what my parents had to say. <br>  <br>  Oh and don't have double standards. If you curse when you're mad, he will when he is. The only way to get him to stop is by stopping yourself|`|A6tkE0fAaa	Call Nanny 911!!!|`|KoJCeYzSaa	if you cant control your own son you shouldnt be rosting to yahoo<br>  you need serious help|`|3E9plH9Iaa	FIRST and foremost,,YOU are the parent,,and as such are legally responsible for his actions..A lot of parents want to be their children's "Pals'' or" Mates"!! When you do that,,they lose all respect for you..Believe me,,they WANT direction,,and advice..Its the manner its dispensed which is the important thing..When your child is leaving the house,,demand a return time and where he is going..If he doesn't wish to give you respect and co-operation,,you tell him he can't go out.. If he storms out or whatever,,tell him you will call the authorities..And if he is STILL defiant,, DO IT !!  Also know this,,once he knows your serious and will do what it takes to enforce your wants,,things will change..I don't know his scholastic prowess,,or his Mates,,but YOU  must control ALL situations regarding him..He will defy you if he can and you let him..He will lie and even sometimes tell you what he thinks you want to hear to get what he wants..You as the parent ,,must PARENT!! Once he knows there are rules,,and your firm with the rules,,his behavior will improve..At HIS age he thinks he knows EVERYTHING ,,and parents know nothing..When he realizes that his kind of behavior won't be accepted,,he'll adapt..Because,,HE MUST !! YOU will make him !! I wish you the best..  SOLOMON|`|RvddYKqjaa	You are the parent. Start parenting. Don't let him go out day and night without you knowing where he is. He's 13, for goodness sake. You have every right to be his parent, and that includes telling him when he's wrong. If you don't, who will? You have given up your control if you just let him storm off. <br>  I don't know that you do well calling your answerers idiots, because some people believe in Spare the rod and spoil the child. I don't agree with physical punishment either, but I also don't know why you think he has the right to abuse YOU. He's reluctant to give details?  He wouldn't leave the house if he lived here. As you say, his behavior is unacceptable, and left alone it will get worse. You have got to step up to the plate and act like the parent you say you are. He needs to have someone to tell him what to do. You're the one! <br>  Swearing can be picked up from parents, but if people on this list are any indication, swearing is taking over our language. Make an effort to stop, but don't let him tell you he cusses because you do. Does he also clean house, do laundry, fix meals, and go to work? Why copy one trait and not all the others?  He's making excuses for himself. <br>  I'm just curious. Do you call your son an idiot too? Name-calling isn't appreciated by anyone.|`|38376c3fed7d8b040a68d894fe4ce37aaa	In this situation you have to be strict. You give him strict instructions about the time. You should monitor his all the activities. You join him for evening activities such as games, sports or gym. Divert his all the activities of evening or spare time. Secondly, find out his friends & take them into confidence. This will help controlling your son. You should know all his friends. If possible try to accompany him at every time he goes out. Try this method.|`|RDgyb7W8aa	I live in US and I wil tell what happened to our son. He was 16, decided not to come home or go to school.  We went local authorities had him picked up and put ion juvenile, We let him spend a week there and then picked him up.  He was changed saying that there was no TV, boring and he couldn't go anyplace.  Your son is a little young for that but maybe you can get a local police officer to talk to him and put a little scare into him.  Either way good luck.|`|F6SilA1Faa	WHIP IT...WHIP IT GOOD!!!!|`|0akF8nCWaa	Smack his butt so hard harder than u smack your partner till it gets red as a healthy rose
trxEyVRLaa	Stuttering isn't a disability is it?<br>  And anyway - just go into school, explain what you were doing, explain that what you said was the only excuse you could think of and admit it was immature. Apologize to him - but no hugs :) That may make the situation worse ;)|`|heXiCKepaa	Did you apologize to your disabled friend?|`|687852ecae21fabd1dfd4f89a2eefd48aa	:Embarrassed" ?<br>  <br>   You should be embarrassed about what you did and go to that friend and apologize in the most sincere way you can - then criticize your self as being a fool - a BIG  fool - and  - mean it!

And then if she find out that you went out tell her that your BEST friend ask you out on the day and your bored so you say yes! <br>  (what a lie... but I'm kinda like that when I don't wanna be with my friends)|`|ml1AshA1aa	well just tell her that your doing something with family and that you will see her later or a another time<br>  or you can tell her what you feel and then say if your going to call my best friend's boyfriend a loser then you shouldn't hang out wit us when he's presence<br>  Good Luck!!!!! =]|`|SOxIG8C9aa	ok well just tell the girl you want to be just friends and not best friends. I have to best friends who hate each other and I just switch between them and so they are just fine that I like both of them as a friend.|`|nHyNksmkaa	tell her you and your friend are doing something tomorrow just the two of you. its better than doing something behind her back. and if she is really a problem tell her to buzz off instead of ignoring her. you might feel bad, but if its what you want do it.

I've always been too embarrassed and the guy has been too far away for me to deliver any well deserved pain. Hats off to that girl at the party!|`|AA11043457	Absolutely, that was an assault by him.  Any unwanted touching is an assault.  So he got what he deserved. Good for her.  <br>  <br>  He must be a really total jerk or very very immature.  I might have slapped him instead, but I think her reaction was priceless.  <br>  <br>  Right on lady.  Maybe that will help the jerk grow up a bit.|`|1OEDcz6Raa	your friend is a ******* jerk. that is one of the rudest things you can do. he should've been arrested for sexual harrassment.<br>  if i was the girl i wouldve beat the **** out of him- spray him with pepper spray then call the cops|`|ce1cd1ce55b68d3025b9888a8f58c391aa	That was fair but im to nice to do that.<br>  <br>  I'd probably just give him a dirty look.<br>  But I kind of like bad boys.lol<br>  I would also be flattered|`|4THbLmvoaa	yes its fair!  good for her!! im glad she did it|`|c4C5hNEyaa	Totally fair.

It sounds like it's going to become a waiting game. If you can pretend it doesn't matter, after time he will slip up and then you will have the evidence you need. Until then, it's a guessing game.<br>  <br>  If he uses Yahoo messenger on the PC, go into it and set (in preferences) the chat logging on. You can also check to see if he uses other 'aliases' by going here:<br>  <br>  C:\Program Files\Yahoo!\Messenger\Profiles<br>  <br>  If you know or can guess his password, all the better.|`|MjSLQlIHaa	yeah i'd be talking to a good divorce lawyer, and starting the divorce process you can find out whatever more than likely he's gonna continue on with his triflingness. good luck!|`|TuqdZtVpaa	oh yes men are sneaky! I would check his phone out! maybe now there textin!|`|GHH1i6d3aa	He's hiding things but that doesn't give you the right to invade his privacy.  Tell him that you don't believe him and the only way you will is if he proves that he isn't talking to her anymore by logging in in front of you so you can read any messages he has before he has a chance to hide them.|`|RkLxRh4daa	Most of the cell companies will transfer all your current info and programs to the new phone unless you say you don't want them, but as far as yahoo messenger, he would have to go online and change the recieving # if he got a new phone#.

That does not fly, jokingly amongst best friends MAYBE, but seriously?  No, don't let that stuff fly if shes being serious.<br>  <br>  Call her fake *** out on it in front of people, and embarrass her, or you can go the real devious route and get some revenge.<br>  <br>  Head over to her house for a sleepover, and put some "nair" in her shampoo.  All her hair will start to fall out afterwards.  Pretty solid, eh?  Please though, get her back for disrespecting your parents.<br>  <br>  I'm a dude, if someone disrespected my parents, I would beat the **** out of him.

Tell her what you told us, ask why she's being so judgemental and cruel. Sometimes when people are having a really hard time, or feeling crappy about themselves, they lash out at the people closest to them, so maybe she's really going through some stuff herself. <br>  <br>  If it's not worth saving the friendship, I'd say "Look, you have been really mean and judgemental lately, and I would really just like to distance myself from you for a while. Call me if you want to talk without being so mean"<br>  <br>  She probably doesn't even realize she is lashing out. Good luck.|`|JghXh9dQaa	if shes your best friend then you shouldnt need to ask the question, she shouldnt be putting you in this position. let it go, dont keep making all the effort when she keeps knocking you back, if she values your friendship then she should take the next step, dont make anymore effort, see how she reacts|`|9LJjNYaMaa	confront her. if she keeps it up, tell everyone she has herpes.|`|LlfLa4Twaa	Tell her to f*** off!

GLKD89wnaa	Your wife is kind of right girls to look to their mothers as role models and most likely whatever behavior their mom does seeing it as acceptable. Also, you should get custody of your daughter if her mother is unfit like that.|`|azE51WGRaa	I think your wife needs to understand that not all behaviors can be classified through psychology. And maybe you should have a long talk with your daughter to find out whats really bothering her and why she feels the need to act the way she does. Speculating about her future isn't going to help her...Communicating will. Also, I hope your wife doesn't say these things in front of your daughter. If she is, she's inflicting psychological trauma on your daughter due to her dislike of your ex. It will also like breed animosity if she is. Good luck to all of you.|`|45NEu1giaa	I think a pattern does emerge, but I also think with the right guidance and a good firm up bringing does kids the world of good. Getting her to do chores without making a fuss and having really good family time together i.e walks, swimming, playing cards or watching a good comedy.  It sounds like things are getting a bit negative at home and regardless of who is right or wrong before you know it your daughter will be leaving home and she won't have many happy memories and thats when the real problems might start|`|KcOpiKiYaa	Everyone has a different personality so your wife is being way too negative. I hated school too but does that make me all those things your wife said your daughter will be? NO!! I graduated and now I'm in college studying what I like most. I'm also married with a daughter and still successful! Also, you should talk to your wife about this. Cause that's a little messed up if you ask me!|`|GHH1i6d3aa	Your wife has good points, but I agree she is being extremely negative.  When it comes to kids, especially daughters, they need their father's faith that they will always be okay, and that they will always be supported no matter what.<br>  <br>  Tell your wife that you'll work on the parenting behavior and positive reinforcement if she stops assuming the worst.|`|88bDvyiwaa	I know how you feel like, my wife always accuses me of looking at other womens vaginas all the time|`|2YX18RE2aa	De Nile is supposed to be a river in Egypt not a method of parenting.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	Truth is, your daughter may have emotional problems because of the divorce, your remarriage and her feelings on the entire situation.  Have her feelings ever been addressed?<br>  <br>  Negative SITUATIONS and unchecked life issues can result in a person vying for attention all the time, even if it's negative.  But i'm sure that, if her mother is a bad example, and has a drinking problem and other things, your daughter does not aspire to be the same way.<br>  <br>  Maybe she needs a neutral party to discuss her issues with?  There are many great child psychologists out there.  I would at least try taking her to one for a while and see how it goes.  Sometimes kids blame themselves for their parents' actions, including bad behaviors and even divorce.  Plus they sometimes feel that their parents' new partners are trying to take their mom/dad away.  We know it's not true, but kids don't have the life experience of an adult... and do not reason in the same way.  <br>  <br>  I have been in and out of therapy for years because of ptsd and depression.  Apparently, i've learned a great deal more through personal experience than your wife, the psychologist did in school.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	I agree that your daughter is probably finding it easier to garner negative attention than positive attention.  Most kids figure out early that you get noticed quicker when you do something bad.<br>  <br>  But I wouldn't be so quick to say she will be just like her mom.  Chance are she will resemble her mother alot in her attitudes and behaviours, IF nobody intercedes to show her a better path.  <br>  <br>  I think you're not ready to fully acknowledge that your daughter needs better guidance than she's getting and your current wife is placing blame instead of accepting her role as step-parent to a child that needs guidance.|`|ee33b2a393b166491be1cc514e3f4156aa	Your wife needs to mind her own business when it comes to your daughter!   Your daughter is not her patient, nor is she her daughter!<br>  Sounds like your wife may not have children of her own because those are the ones with the best advice!|`|ByUS0k8waa	Hate to say but sometimes children take the same road as the parent they are with the most. So it possible and your wife wouldn't stop it since she was the same way at that age. Im more on your wife's side. Also as a child from a family that slings you from one to the other you do learn to manipulate people into what you want. I have never had a problem with getting anything I have ever wanted from anyone. Its very easy to play your parents against each other at that age.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	you can teach her love .. but it takes time .. best thing is to be the love of her life .. instead of what your doing now .. look at it this way .. if you want love you must give it to .ok .. try a new way of doing things .. give her a little less time on her own .. keep her  doing family things with you .. that way she see s you doing it ..|`|B359bLqsaa	Well, if she misbehaves badly enough and hates school at 14, there is a very good chance that she will be a drop out, which only leads to other problems.  I think I would listen to your wife.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	So is it fair to assume that your wife has made a suggestion about how to get around this negative attention seeking behaviour?
m5CqJbYDaa	Absolutely not !! I just got out of a 21 year relationship that I was not happy with,only stayed together because of children,sex never happened but maybe a couple times a month and then it was just plain and not even worth doing! Every day activies decline because your always worring about your relationship,whether you want to be in it or if they're cheating,etc... Can even lead to low self esteem,depression,anxiety,and of course what happened to me,turned to drinking just to be able to tolerate the relationship,my advice is if your not happy and your significant other won't hear what you have to say or try to work things out,or if you just want someone else,then end it,dont waste any more of your life,I lost 21 years that I'll never get back! Now i've gotta start all over at the age of 38,and don't know where to start since its been so long!!  **** SWEET MILDRED SENT ME TO HELP YOU***|`|CTIyEnVQaa	Making a list of everything you can for yourself to cope in your marriage or a plan of how to work on stuff to make your marriage better might help. It always tends to give me a positive feeling about things, then I can move on to whatever else needs doing. If I start focusing on my relationship problems then I have another look at my list/plan and have a few minutes thinking about how I'm moving forward. I feel more in control of things when I have a plan for dealing with issues so thought it might help you too. Best of luck on Tuesday with your exam!!<br>  BTW having just been through a really messy, hideous separation, custody battle and soon a divorce I really recommend doing everything you can to avoid it!! Obviously if theres violence and/or abuse then get out asap (there was in my marriage) but if thats not a factor and you have any options you haven't explored then keep at it!! There's heaps of books and advice out there - some are abit different to the normal society opinion on how to do things (the submissive wife for example - has a definite effect though!) but give it all a go before you pack it in.|`|ee33b2a393b166491be1cc514e3f4156aa	No, it's difficult to function when there is so much stress around you. And it affects you in so many ways.  For years, I felt awful, depressed, tired, sick, ...then I got a divorce!<br>  Best thing that ever happened to me!|`|E7TkNO00aa	Not really, when something bad is on your mind, it's rough to do things. If you and your spouse come to an agreement with visitation rights and on your divorce, that's good for your child. You both need to think what's best for her at this moment. Give it your best and keep on studying. Do it for you and your child. I'm sorry to hear that you both are going through a rough time. Good luck.|`|MjSLQlIHaa	personally my gf has a significant amount of control on my mood, and yes when we fight iam a mess at everything. its unhealthy to feel this way , and i would suggest some counseloring and if that doesn't work just leave. you need to be well and functioning especially for your lil girl! good luck and i wish you the best!|`|zu10q3Qyaa	What is a mum?

JYgJD0Rwaa	There is no such thing as a quick divorce, ESPECUALLY Arkansas.<br>  You can file a no fault divorce in AR but ONLY if you're: "Voluntarily living separately without cohabitation for 18 months". That means you have to be separated for 18 months before you can file. Otherwise you'll have to file a fault based divorce, for which you need to provide proof.<br>  Once the papers are filed you're required to wait an additional 3 months before the divorce is legal.|`|7cdc801bdb4ad5ebfe07957d02070809aa	A spouse must be a resident of the state of Arkansas for at least 60 days prior to filing for the divorce and the divorce will not be finalized until a 3 months waiting period has passed after the initial filing.<br>  No-Fault grounds for divorce means v]voluntarily living separately without cohabitation for 18 months. So if you meet no fault requirement which is 18 month not living together and having sex during this time, you still have to wait minimum 5 month to get final decree.|`|1k7LIZVWaa	You might find answers here:  <a href="http://www.divorcesupport.com/divorce/Arkansas-Divorce-2480.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.divorcesupport.com/divorce/Ar...</a>|`|tbJraueLaa	did you get a quick marriage?

AA11972752	I sense your sarcasm. :P<br>  <br>  Horoscopes are just for fun and so vague that they can be true for a large segment of the population. You can't let something designed to describe people so vaguely rule your life.<br>  <br>  Besides, think of it this way... Horoscope can say you're complete opposites, but even complete opposites can have fulfilling marriages... You just need to work at it. I don't think that any horoscope says that you have to divorce someone... It will just tell you how easy or difficult a relationship will be.<br>  <br>  You have to be the one to decide what you want in life, and if the work that must be put into a marriage is worth it to you or not.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	That's exactly why I love reading the horoscopes.

Allow all horoscopes to totally control your every thought, motion, choice and careers.  Everyone knows they are always right, down to the very moment in time.|`|0PdYYeBFaa	NO NO NO...please do not leave on the basis of a horoscope. A horoscope reading is so generic.

e0a81333aa57f8661514f1fcf591fc64aa	be honest, funny, confident in speaking with her and her friends. bury your shyness and be yourself like with your friends.|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	Be honest with yourself. Do you truly want to become friends with this person or are you just curious about what propelled him or her to suicide? If it's the latter, then most assuredly you will come across as insincere no matter what other steps you follow. <br>  Consider your thoughts and feelings about suicide. If you're coming from a judgmental place and believe that suicide makes this person "bad" or "evil" in some way, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to maintain any type of friendship. On the other hand, if you are someone who is either perplexed or saddened by another attempting suicide, the friendship has a chance. <br>  Look back at your past relations with this person. How have you treated him/her? If your contact was in any way negative, realize that in the mind of a depressive (through no fault of your own), any negativity can be magnified to become a source of intense pain. For the most part though, you may discover that you have done little or nothing to make things either worse or better for this person. In this case, skip the following step. <br>  Apologize, sincerely, for any wrongdoing you may have done to this person in the past. If you cannot sincerely apologize for any mean or even slightly mean thing you have done, then you need to back away from the possibilities of friendship with this person. <br>  Step up your casual greetings. For example, if before, you have said "hi" to this person in the hallway between classes, ask them which teacher they have next. In this case you can either commiserate over a particularly difficult teacher or say "lucky you" if he/she has a delightful one. The key is to open the lines of communication. <br>  Find out about his/her interests. Are any of them something you are interested in as well? If so, you have a particularly potent starting point for conversation. <br>  Talk about your shared interests in a setting that makes sense to have this conversation. If need be, ask for a specific time to talk about something. For example, if you know there is a shared interest in gardening, say something along the lines of "Hey, I've got a rosebush and since winter is coming, do you have any ideas about how I could tend to them?" <br>  Repeat this process of questions on an irregular, yet sincere basis. Don't do it so often that you become an annoying pest with your questions, but often enough so that the question and answer sessions extend past the original topic of conversation. About once or twice a week should do it. <br>  Invite him/her to your house once after a couple of months of this, to show the progress of your shared interests. Actually, at this point, you may feel comfortable enough to simply invite him/her to your house. <br>  Repeat as you ordinarily would with any friendship, because by now, you have, if not quite a friendship, at least the solid foundation for one.
Z9jlS2bUaa	be persistent, don't screw it up.|`|0PdYYeBFaa	I can only talk for myself...i do not know if your lady is the same. But i have been emotional in intercourse with my husband (at that time we we were merely dating).<br>  <br>  My emotions is mixed feelings of love yet anxiety. Love in the sense I have intense feelings for him, want to commit my all and at that time wished he wanted the same. However the anxiety on the other hand is a fear i may be hurt again especially if i have been affected by hurt and we have been through the lows of the imaginable..nearly losing each other.<br>  <br>  In regards to this situation, I did give him give him a chance and we are now blissfully married. However it did and still is taking me time to try to bring this guard i have put up in me which i did not know till now i was doing.<br>  <br>  I think in order for your situation to restore, you are really going to have to show signs of commitment, care, want to try, love, reassurance and spend ample and quality time with her.<br>  <br>  I pray everything works out for you.<br>  <br>  ADDITIONAL INFO:<br>  - I tried to run away from the emotions I was going through when things were going hard during the time me and my husband in the past were merely in a dating relationship. I actually did run to another country for three months. That was a wake up call in our relationship. I went to Scotland and now I am back in England, London. He has made it clear if i attempt, he is coming with me...he don't want me doing that again. I got a lot of earful from doing that not only from him, but his friends and mine telling me that he was not himself.|`|8623f79be89d09f5558c35e0cd1faabcaa	well, she doesn't trust you. Be there for her, be optimistic, show her that you changed, start from now, send her flowers, take her to romantic dates, and when she trusts you that you have changed, she will come back.<br>  <br>  But my guess is, you will be the same old bored boring careless inconsiderate person that you were, when you know you have her.

Toqu9lTqaa	Trust me on this, join as many clubs as you can or play a sport you meet so many new people that way. Go to school activities like dances or your school play for example. Raise your hand alot in class. After a test, turn to someone and say something like "how easy was that?" just start up a conversation. Be loud and make alot of jokes in class (but not in the annoying way) All these thing will definitely get you to meet more people.|`|briRpzL1aa	Easy.. Join a club of some sort doing things you like.

Bd16ixUQaa	This is a really helpful resource: <a href="http://www.healthscout.com/ency/68/776/main.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthscout.com/ency/68/776/m...</a><br>  <br>  Definitely consult your doctor.<br>  <br>  Erectile dysfunction can be caused by psychological or physical factors. Psychological factors are the cause approximately 10% of the time. This is commonly due to anxiety, stress, depression, excess fatigue or dissatisfaction with the relationship with the partner.<br>  <br>  Physical causes can include any disorder that prevents the nervous system or vascular system from responding appropriately to arousal. That includes injuries to spinal cord, or damage to the nerves in the genital area from diabetes, multiple sclerosis or surgery. Vascular problems can be caused by medications, diabetes, high blood pressure, and atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). Hormonal problems, kidney disease, liver disease, excessive alcohol ingestion, and infections can also cause ED.<br>  <br>  --<br>  <br>  The diagnosis of erectile dysfunction is established through a detailed visit with your doctor that is designed to evaluate for all of the causes listed above. This can usually be accomplished through a series of questions and a detailed physical examination. Further tests may be necessary to look for some of the physical or medical causes of ED. Blood tests to measure blood sugar, kidney and liver function and hormone levels may be ordered. More specialized tests include an ultrasound of the genital area to view it’s blood vessel anatomy and measure the blood flow characteristics of the area. This may involve scanning before and after an injection of a drug that creates an erection. Less commonly, more invasive tests may be used if vascular problems are suspected. Cavernosometry is a test that measures the pressure in the penile blood vessels and the sponge-like penile tissue. It assesses if blood flow to the area is adequate for forming an erection. Cavernosography involves the injection of radiographic dye into the penile blood system to see if there is an abnormal leakage of blood out of the sponge-like tissue that is preventing the proper accumulation of blood necessary to create an erection.<br>  <br>  Treatment of Impotence (Erectile Dysfunction)<br>  <br>  Treatment of erectile dysfunction is tailored to each individual and depends upon the cause. Psychological causes may be treated with therapy or medication, and proper treatment can result in improved sexual function. A six to twelve week course of sex therapy has been useful in such cases as well.<br>  Various medications can be used to improve penile blood flow and allow for an erection. A relatively new class of drugs, called PDE5 inhibitors, create increased blood flow by enhancing the levels of nitric oxide in the blood vessels in the penis. The first drug of this new class, Viagra, has received widespread attention and use. More recently, a new drug in this class, Levitra, was approved which functions using the same mechanism. Both drugs require sexual arousal in order to work. Viagra should be taken on an empty stomach 30 to 60 minutes prior to the desired time of effect. Levitra can be taken, with or without an empty stomach, 30 to 60 minutes prior to sex. About 60 to 70% of men who take the drugs experience longer and more rigid erections. Side effects for both drugs include headaches, flushing, indigestion, dizziness, and stuffy or runny nose. Both drugs may rarely cause blue-tinged vision and diarrhea. Neither drug should be used by patients taking nitrates, such as nitroglycerine, or in patients with recent heart attack or stroke. Neither drug should be taken more than once every 24 hours.<br>  <br>  For patients that do not respond to PDE5 inhibitors, medications can be injected directly into the penis. Such drugs include alprostadil, papaverine and phentolamine.<br>  <br>  Devices such as vacuum devices or penile implants may also be recommended by your doctor depending upon the specific cause of ED or your medical condition.<br>  <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!!|`|ixyNeBhWaa	See other people.  I know that sounds taboo to a lot of (closed minded) people but it helps a relationship.<br>  There is a saying..<br>  <br>  Marriage is like holding your partner hostage, and the price of ransom is always your development.<br>  <br>  You need to broaden your horizons.. live life.<br>  Be smart about it, be open to her about it, you never know.. she might agree with you on this and you two would be even closer, this sort of thing always puts a relationship to its perfect test... the Trust test.<br>  How much you trust yourself and her to be open about life.<br>  <br>  Porn is over-rated... you need something that is real.<br>  <br>  Maybe you two can do some role playing?<br>  Or bring in another person.<br>  Or just the action of going on a date with another person would be enough to get your mood rising.|`|zdSRsySNaa	Imagine your partner with another man.

AA11043457	TIME<br>  I wouldn't call you young, some of my worst broken hearts were when I was in Jr. High.  Or maybe even before.    I remember crying because a guy I really liked didn't like me for a GF but just a friend to play with (like cowboy and Indians) in the back yard.  But when my GF came by, he wouldn't play like that and paid attention to her in a different way.  I liked to play cowboys and Indians but I was growing up too and wanted him to like me as a girl as well.  He didn't.  Thought my heart would break.  It is funny now, but wasn't back then.<br>  <br>  Sometimes if he knows you like him, and when his relationship ends, and many or most of them do end at that age, then he may notice you. Just be a friend and keep saying hello as you walk by.  If he says anything, you can always say, "Hey, I think you are a great guy and sure I like you, but that's okay if we are only friends."  And let it go at that.  Then treat him just as a friend and don't pursue him.  Talk to others. Smile at someone you'd like to get to know and say hello.  Guys like girls to smile at them and to know their name.  <br>  <br>  Boys are often scared to talk to girls or to admit they like them as they are more scared than girls are of rejection.  So if you smile at guys and say their name, they notice and they may talk to you.<br>  <br>  I remember my daughter in about the 3rd or 4th grade and she had a crush on this guy named Tommy.  She pointed him out to me.  They had swimming lessons and it was to teach all the kids to swim.  I was waiting for her and this boy standing near by turned to his mother and said, "Mom, see that girl over there?"  I looked and he was pointing to my daughter.  Then he said in a very proud sounding voice, "She's crazy about me!"  I had to try my best not to laugh as I got so tickled at that. My daughter, when I told her, was embarrassed and didn't appreciate my laughter, but she didn't hear the way he said it.  It told me he liked her too.  I tried to tell it as he said it.<br>  <br>  But a few weeks later that was old news so with time you will get over him.  But you may remember later on with fondness. <br>  <br>  The best thing is to go on and have a lot of friends you talk to, boys and girls.  Don't be too pushed to grow up fast. Enjoy being a kid.   <br>  <br>  But if you smile and talk to boys and girls and look the boys in the eye when you smile, you will be hard to resist.  They are shy many times and that will tell them they can talk to  you.<br>  <br>  Just be patient.  Sometimes in7th grade, the boys are still pulling your hair to show they like you so they don't grow up to maturity as fast as girls do.  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you. Wish I could send you a hug and tell  you to hang in there and things willwork out okay.|`|817fb3b41964d1a4b3bab64330936db8aa	hang out with your girls and make yourself forget about him by having fun.<br>  <br>  there are plenty of other fish in the sea. im not calling you young, but you are and you will have many more good and bad moments with boys. at 13 (guessing) they are immature and whimsical. enjoy those years and dont let one NO ruin your world.|`|kDTwktItaa	Hello :D<br>  <br>  Well, maybe you can just forget about him.

The 5 of us each have a personalized key to enter the Clubhouse and we all love it! We all also have nicknames for each other like Anna Banana (Me!) and M&M (Emma). It's really fun! :)<br>  <br>  Lol, The clubhouse is connected to a local power-line and it's as big as my kitchen! (Medium Sized).

36b623b8cc3d49c114ca5db25d539a12aa	Nobody is really normal.  Try to be confident with yourself and who you are and you will notice that people will like you regardless of whether or not you are "normal".  I've always been a little odd myself and have had people tell me so, especially when I was in high school.  However, the older I get, the less I care, and I've found that just being confident regardless of your personality causes people to like you because they see that you like yourself.|`|pQGb9dy8aa	First off, who's to say who is normal and who isn't? There is no set version of a "normal" person. Besides, if everyone was "normal," then the world wouldn't be too interesting, would it?<br>  If this means *that* much to you, just observe some of the more liked kids, the ones that get good grades, participate in sports, have a good group of friends, etc. I'm not suggesting that you try to be exactly like them, but maybe it will give you a lead as to how you want to act.<br>  Hope I could help.

You shouldn't care what people say because they all are haters and they are just mad that they don't have any life and that they are boring. People say that i act "white" because i talk really clearly and with a lot of grammar but i don't car because i have a style of my own and that's what makes me awesome. You just need to know that you are AWESOME and that you are good at it, that's what i say....I hope i helped you a little bit|`|DHQtkLvWaa	Well, of course I don't know you, but I'm sure you're completely fine. Everyone has their quirks, and I guess you just have more accentuated ones than most people. Be proud of those quirks and find more people like yourself. Everyone is their own person; don't be ashamed of who you are. I'm pretty strange too. While most people in my 7th grade Eng. Class a few years ago were researching cars, history and people for our fall project, I was looking up Spontaneous Human Combustion. So, I got a few weird looks. <br>  It's ok to be strange.

AA11286455	Sometimes, *new* Christians or born-agains calm down and stop being so over-bearing about their new-found *truth* or the expectation that they proselytize.  Sometimes they don't.  <br>  <br>  Beyond what you've already reasonably and maturely said, done, and tried to do, understand that what you have to do is:  NOT A DAMN THING.  <br>  <br>  Wait her out, however long it takes.  Stand your ground.  Help and support your son in standing his.  <br>  <br>  Now, if you think there is truly something you just HAVE to do?   <br>  <br>  --Don't let the kid alone with grandma again until he's old enough to understand the concept of "discretion", <br>  <br>  --Is mature enougn to know he doesn't have to stand there and be all polite or a "captive audience" Understands that he is enabled and empowered to walk away from her on his own, <br>  <br>  --Or she "sees the light" and is prepared to "ask for forgiveness for [her'] tresspasses and forgives those who, supposedly "tresspasses against...."<br>  <br>  Thank you for being a good and responsible dad.  You deserve all the respect in the world for it.
AA11972752	Yes, I think I can add a little insight into this. You're expecting for her to think rationally, and so when you give her a list of questions in a neat, numbered fashion, you'd expect some answers to at least a few of them. So you assume that when that hasn't happened, it must be that you're doing something wrong. That's not the case. You've made every attempt to talk to her rationally. The problem is that you're working off of a flawed assumption: you're expecting rational behavior from her. She is the type of person that reacts emotionally.<br>  <br>  When she changed her mind about you, instead of owning up to her past judgment about you, she finds ways to justify her past behavior by making up something, anything to prove her point, and whether or not it is true is not completely relevant to her. It's all about perception! It would be too emotionally uncomfortable for her to admit to making a mistake. So as you can see, her responses are going to be emotional, instead of logical.<br>  <br>  Anyway, your best bet is to stop trying to rationalize with her and start having a more formal arrangement with her. Sign up for the child support, simply because that's the responsible thing to do. Then file for a visitation schedule. If she isn't going to contest visitation, then you can file pro se. Pro se is just filling out the paperwork yourself and you can get the paperwork by going up to the court and asking for it. If she plans to get a lawyer and contest the visitation, then you will have to get a lawyer too. She will have to have a good reason for contesting the visitation, though, because as a matter of course, the courts always order regular unsupervised visitation for the dad. Reasons for supervised visitation would be claims that he's a drug dealer, child abuser, or anything extreme like that, but if you're normal people, then she doesn't have a leg to stand on.<br>  <br>  You can try reminding her that child support and custody are handled as separate issues in the eyes of the courts. Even if he is not paying his child support, he can still get visitation from the courts. Even though he would still get the visitation, he will have to endure a lecture from the judge about responsibility! And the mom will be told to file for child support enforcement, because that judge won't be able to handle that issue for her in the same case as the case for visitation.<br>  <br>  I don't know if this rationalization will work with her. While logically you'd expect for her to realize that the courts operate one way, she may not be able to accept this, because she FEELS that they are connected and after all, what she feels can't be wrong! So she may end up trying to argue that no child support = no visitation, but in the end, the courts will not agree with her on this issue.<br>  <br>  Oftentimes, when custody or visitation is contested, the courts will order mediation, so that the parents can work out a customized visitation schedule. I'd really recommend it. Maybe even skip having the courts order it, and have the parents do it that way voluntarily.<br>  <br>  Also, I would suggest limiting your contact with the ex. You don't want to have to deal with the drama. You could be her friend one minute and an enemy the next. Then she'll use whatever perceived wrong by you in order to interfere with the dad's relationship with his kid. Why voluntarily sign up for that drama? I'd probably de-friend her on MySpace, if I were you. Things may be okay between you two now, but I wouldn't count on it staying that way.<br>  <br>  Edit: I wanted to respond to your additional details about not having enough money. You have a few choices here. First, you can wait until you get on your feet financially in order to take care of this. Think of it as an important goal to work toward. If you don't want to wait, maybe even get a second job to take care of the lawyer's bill. OR, if you want to take care of this now, you can look up pro bono lawyers. They'll either work for free if your income is low enough, or if you're in a higher income bracket, then they'll work on a sliding scale based on your income, so that you can get a lawyer representing you for less money. Look up pro bono lawyers on the internet or a phone book, or ask around at the court for a phone number to a pro bono lawyer service.|`|0KLu4hRaaa	It is called manipulation and you are her target.

You can be present to support your future spouse, but you have no place in the decision making process.

The ex girlfriend will always be around because of the child. I'm 25 years old and I have never been married. My parents have been faithfully married for almost 35 years.<br>  <br>  Your boyfriend and his ex girlfriend have a history together that cannot ever be erased. Some people try and erase a person's history by getting married (or remarried) and having other children. Can you picture being in the current circumstance for the next 30 or 50 years?  It's to bad there are two children stuck in the middle of the confusion.<br>  <br>  Personally, if a man has children I would only date him if he was a widower. I know some people can handle the dynamics of a blended family. I could never deal with an ex wife (or girlfriend) because there are to many variables.  I wish you the best of luck if you decide to get married.  Hopefully you can give the children some stability.

A deucedly clever chap who could doubtless find your missing guests.  I've heard, however, that he has retired from his profession.  To be brutally honest, Old Top, you're probably better served without him.  The reasons for this are two-fold:<br>  Firstly, the fellow is quite likely to find your guests, a feat you might rather accomplish on your own or not at all, given the circumstances.  Secondly, for all his wile and cunning, from a strict standpoint of hygiene and appearance, the man is an absolute stain.  He ambles about, hair tousled, in a rumpled trench coat, like one of those gumshoes that the lower classes enjoy reading about in their Penny Dreadfuls.  Worst of all are his cigars - fetid, noxious stumps, the likes of which can be had for 'tuppence a fistful' at any of the lower class markets.<br>  No, my good man, if I may offer a suggestion, let your guests find their own way.  Or not.  You can't be expected to molly-coddle them all, especially after they've been helping themselves to your sherry all night.<br>  Right-ho, then.

XjBKV2ohaa	Believe it or not, it probably has nothing at all to do with you.  It sounds as though she has some issues of her own, and probably has low self-esteem herself.  Some people with a low opinion of themselves will tear down someone else in order to feel like they are somehow better or superior.  Maybe this started in her own childhood, when other people would ridicule her.  She's just repeating what she's learned.<br>  <br>  If she's very skilled at cutting you down, she'll try to find out what things bother you the most, then she'll focus on those things.<br>  <br>  I recommend:<br>  a) Don't let her comments get to you - it's really not about you.<br>  b) Be genuinely nice to her, regardless of how she treats you.<br>  c) Make sure you spend time with friends who are kind and supportive of you - it will help to balance out the negativism you get from her.<br>  <br>  You mentioned that you have low self-esteem.  Here's something that has helped me.  If you are Christian, you will know that you were made in the image of God.  That's a pretty good pattern to be modeled after!  And since God made you, remember that God doesn't make junk.<br>  <br>  I can tell by reading your post that you are intelligent, caring, articulate, and thoughtful.  Those are wonderful qualities.

Look into their eyes. If you look down and straight face they will know you are kinda shy..|`|N0ZLYx6baa	Just be yourself. And if she shuns you because of it, she wouldn't be a good friend anyway!!
ByUS0k8waa	He just wants to get you back to play the same game. He doesn't want you but he doesn't want anyone else to have you either. That is the way it breaks down to. So I would say ignore him and his comments. Just be like you threw a good thing away. You deserve to be with someone who treats you right and Im guessing the new guy does so why do you care about this other guy. Once a cheater always a cheater. Just remember that. You cant change a man unless they are ready and want to change.|`|cdQryr7paa	I think it's pretty obvious what he is trying to do.<br>  He is trying to get people to tell you he has feelings for you so that you break up with your current bf and start jumping into bed with him again.<br>  But if you do, understand he will be the same back stabbing cheater you have grown to know he is.<br>  You need to stay away from him, and stop running back to him.|`|3frK2iHaaa	WTF,hes using u.|`|n8lXItGraa	He's playing mind games with you.  He figures you'll feel guilty that he misses you and realizes what a jerk he was.  Ignore it.  You are happier now..right?  Even if you weren't with the new guy, why would you even consider taking him back.  He'll never change.  You've seen it time and time again.  He had his chance..or chances, and blew it every time.  Don't let him lure you back in.  You're better off without him. You deserve to be treated with respect...he doesn't respect you.   Hope this helps...|`|kQgSi1MEaa	He's trying to get in your pants again.  You gotta learn when enough is enough, screw what he says, it's too late.  He deserves to be alone and miserable.|`|lSGNCKitaa	He does have feelings for you , but he's just a player.<br>  Don't give him another chance, it's time for you to hurt him by not returing to him.|`|djUMvICoaa	He's having a little trouble with his grasses, they always look greener on the other side.  Remedy, fix the damn fence so he can't come back.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	maybe he's admitting he is stupid, but that isn't a reason to go back to him.<br>  <br>  he seems confused and a person who has some real issues...|`|14A10JcLaa	Once a cheater, always a cheater.  Fuckthe jerk and his "sudden regret."<br>  <br>  <br>  <<----Never cheated, never will|`|oeEsnwSMaa	Leave him alone, you should not care what he trying to do! its not your problem anymore!  move on  and good luck|`|rcx668lgaa	He is trying for yet another round of the only game he knows how to play.  When your "friends" report what he is saying you should respond, "Gee that's too bad for him he had more than one chance and gets no more."  You can be sure in no time at all these "friends" will let him know and he will be finally done and gone.<br>  <br>  I have put quotations around the word friends because I think you may need to visit that issue as well.|`|wpi36XBAaa	Maybe he's hoping that by doing this, he will get you back on his merry-go-round of an on again/off again relationship. Maybe he misses his friend with benefits.Maybe he's just a louse who wants only the one that got away, the one that's hard to get. Which could be why he's always moving on to the next best thing. He likes the challenge only.<br>  You're already in another relationship, so stop wondering about this lousy cheat and get on with your life. If you accept him back, you will be getting exactly what you had, a liar and a cheat.|`|lnkOwDvmaa	He wants what he can't have. He likes the challenge, and the chasing and only wants you when he can't have you. As soon as you get back together with him the old game will start all over again. You should just stick with your current  boyfriend...|`|15995e06bdbb5238f93a646319767868aa	ignore him - hard as it may be, ignore him.<br>  <br>  best thing about these situations is that you can take comfort in knowing that he f&*^ed you up, but ironically he is now more f^&%ed up than you will ever be,<br>  <br>  He had his chance and blew it......twice!<br>  <br>  smile and move on.|`|jfsBX6kJaa	He knows he f up, and now your with someone new. And he wishes he was with you. Don't go back.  I hope you are happy with your new  man.|`|c1bqzJqwaa	**** maybe I should stop to be always the good guy<br>  and begin to act like your ex bf|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	He's secretly in search of a psychiatrist. In fact, it's so secret, he doesn't even know it. But you do ;-)|`|FewhKlx9aa	Sounds to me like he knows he can have you whenever he wants by just saying the right words and your back in his bed. Nothing wrong with him,you just can't say no and move on
AA10331655	Find out why she doesnt want you to date him...if it's because she wants too then you need to decide if he's worth all that.|`|AXAyuFW8aa	Who cares what your friend thinks? If you have feelings for him, go for it. She can't tell you who to date and who not to date. Just ignore her and ask the guy out.|`|IAVOLvCEaa	If it is because she likes him 2 then neither of u should date him but if she doesn't give u a reason go for it|`|WL1ghKx8aa	you follow ur heart
PjlhgQ3uaa	***** about her :P|`|AA11043457	If you like him as more than a friend and want  him for yourself,  you don't.<br>  <br>  If you are truly just a friend, you can say, "I don't want to make  you made, friend, but I'm afraid you are going to get hurt by this girl and i'm a bit worried about you."  then if he doesn't say anything to ask you to say more, don't say more.<br>  <br>  If he asks you why, then  you can tell what you know, but not what you don't know.  If you think it, tell him you think it but don't know for sure. If there is some action she took that makes you think it, tell  him that. <br>  <br>  But remember, if he doesn't ask why you'd say that, let it go.  He may not want to know it.  If he says oh it is okay or blows you off, just say, "Well, I hope it goes well, but remember I'm your friend no matter what."  And again let it go or you won't be his friend anymore.<br>  <br>  Good luck. You are right to want to know how to do it nicely and to warn him.  But it is complicated too much if you have a thing for him.  Then maybe you can say less or just an "I hope you don't get hurt by her." and say little else.|`|817fb3b41964d1a4b3bab64330936db8aa	what do you mean by no good? did you date her? did she do something to you?<br>  <br>  man, tread lightly. its not a win-win situation. if he really digs this chick and you come with some lip about her, he may turn on you. if you got facts you can support and you're concerned about him getting some kind of STD or serious drama from her, i feel your concern, but you got to be ready for him possibly turning on you.<br>  <br>  there's just no nice way to do it.<br>  <br>  wish you the best...|`|AA11646252	Wait for what seems the right time and just kind of hint about it.  If he ask tell him but if he is not interested in hearing just leave it alone.  If you push he will just go away.<br>  <br>  rd|`|LgEdjhe0aa	You don't. If you do you are risking your friendship. Just wait until he finds out for himself and be there to support him. x
jOI0KLbkaa	Yup. Have done it many times with children,grandchildren and spouse.|`|AazkuVzqaa	Yea it's possible, depends on what kind of clothes they are wearing and if they are a light or heavy sleeper.  Most light sleepers freak out and wake up within seconds of being touched.|`|AA11275560	I took my wife's pants off while i was asleep one night but she woke me up.|`|AA11043457	Yes, with some people.  Some sleep very soundly or some are on medication to sleep.  Ever seen someone bring in a baby and undress it for bed?  Well people can be the same way.  If with someone you trust, you can just be so tired,  you can't totally wake up. Depends on where you are in the sleep cycle as to the depth of the sleep.  I'd not recommend trying it unless it is a spouse or live in partner.  <br>  <br>  Some people also,when awoken, wake up fighting so you could get a punch as well. You take  your chances.  When I used to have to wake up my dad, I'd sometimes squirt water on him, being sure to be well away from the bed as he was a fighter when he woke up and didn't know who was there - it was all defensive.  I used to hate to have to wake him up.|`|9773a1274f33361977f590679b7c92a8aa	Well, if you drug them it makes it a lot easier.|`|Z51fjE2Raa	You know.. sometimes you can make them undress.<br>  <br>  I read somewhere that when people are sleeping they are really easy to manipulate.. Like getting them to walk around, etc.<br>  <br>  So.. I dunno. I guess you could do this then too.|`|YLkD4lgPaa	Yes it is possible!!|`|vZYH19oaaa	Yeah...my boyfriend does it to me all the time, lol !!|`|gFGoVYE1aa	if their a very deep sleeper, i did that once..
vbjgMBdVaa	Just tell them upfront dont avoid them|`|raQe8rFjaa	just tell them why you don't want to be friends with them anymore, and you might even solve your problem if thats the reason why you don't want to be that person's friend
AA10975867	Let them go on their fancy-shmancy destination wedding alone. You should call the bride's parents and make friends with them, explain your financial situation and ask them if they would be willing to plan a big family/friends reception after the kids get back from their honeymoon. If you each toss in a thousand dollars you can throw a great party at the veteran's hall or church hall or even a park. Consider this - if those two selfish young pups don't feel grateful enough to their parents for raising them, then they won't miss you at the actual ceremony. They say they want you to attend but, if they really did, they wouldn't be making such an unreasonable plan. If you don't make your suggestion out to be a negative thing, just put it as a positive alternative plan to help everyone out, it should be fine. I know as a mother you will be aching in your heart to miss the ceremony but life goes on. When your next child marries and has the sense to have it convenient for family, your eldest will se the error of his ways - or not. In which case, it won't matter. This is a tough economy and for kids to expect parents to go into debt or add a second mortgage just so they can have a fantasy wedding is quite disrespectful. When you hit 40 or 50, you need to be thinking of retirement, not adding more debt. For the poster who acknowledges that she has to buy even clothing for her family plus accomodation and food, I feel sorry for your family. They are very strapped for funds and are probably having to over-extend themselves and borrow money just to please you. Love goes both ways. Yes, it is the bride's day but family is forever and I , for one, would NEVER put my family in a bad situation just to get my way. While you are looking at wedding photos, your family members are looking at their overdraft or bank notices. Shame on you!|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	If they want both, they need to figure out a compromise. Since they are the ones getting married and paying for it, no one else can decide what is done. <br>  <br>  Personally, I would try to find a venue my fiance and I loved that allowed for family to attend.|`|AA10050051	I understand that this is their wedding and you want to make sure the bride and groom get all their wishes fulfill but you also have to make them understand that if they decide to get married where they want, that they are only going to have the family members there that can actually afford to be there. No one is going to try to break their bank and make it even harder for them financially because of this wedding. So, tell them that they have two choices: Have a beautiful wedding in the location of their choice and have, really, no family members there because of the price and cost of it all or have it nearby where they are assure their families will be there to attend the happy day. You can understand they want everything to be perfect, the location and everything else you could think of, but, it is up to them to decide which of the two choices they want to go for.|`|AA10722993	I think destination weddings are the most inconsiderate things ever invented.  I  could never afford to go someplace to attend one.   Why not have the wedding in their home town, and then go to the destination for the honeymoon.   Makes a lot more sense to me.<br>  <br>  Don't ever feel guilty for not spending all that money to go.  Your son and his fiancee are being very selfish to not even consider the expense to their families.  <br>  <br>  If you feel you must do something, have a reception for them when they get back, but I sure wouldn't spend a lot of money on that either.|`|Likst1Mxaa	Go out to dinner after they come back. Some people do this and feel that it is special, even if you can't be there on the day. It might give the bride a chance to wear her dress again too ;)|`|9be22b5e8274ad1db7ce0512878cadc5aa	FAMILY ATTENDANCE!! Do you live in the same town? Perhaps you could have a small party after with the fam :o) BBQ???!|`|iDfRTLklaa	I would speak to your son, and say as much as you would love to be there for his wedding, you just can not do it due to finances.  Maybe between you and your son's in laws family you could suggest organising a local reception.   This could be organised for when the happy couple return from their wedding, and that way all the family can feel they are included in their wedding.|`|q84KT11saa	It is there day.  Just explain to your son that you really want to be there and your going to do your best to attend, however, right now you are short on the funds to make such a large trip.  Hopefully this will allow him to see your point of view and possibly work something out for the better. I'm not certain how well you get along with your son.  So based on that situation it may work or it may not.  Best of luck! =)|`|d1TTwwUUaa	My daughter is getting married in FL on the beach We live in IL she is going to have the ceremony video taped and have it played here at the reception.  So she's married there reception here for all friends and family.|`|dHPA390Qaa	I hope that they will reconsider and marry with the love of their families surrounding them, and take the trip as a honeymoon.|`|whmkGDG8aa	My Fiance and I are getting married in Scotland.  My family is from Ohio.   Where as my brother and sister-in-law can't make it due to them having a new born.  The rest of my family is making an effort to make it to our wedding.  They understand that it's our day and that we want to do what is best for us.  I don't find that selfish.  Men and Women who have their weddings for their families can end up having very many regrets.  It's about them not their family.  Is that somewhat hard to take in?  Yes but it's really true.<br>  <br>  I though am blessed with a family that will make it to my wedding no matter what we decided because they respect us.  My mom lost her job 7 months ago and my dads factory is cutting back to 4 days a week.  My sister is a stay at home mom, and her husband a social worker.  They have 3 kids, though only their 5 year old daughter is coming as my flower girl.  Her other 2 get to stay with family. <br>  <br>  I talked with them many times about having in Ohio to help them but they said time and time again do what is best for my fiance and I and they will be there for me in the end.  Now of course we've bought their outfits, and their accomodations and most all their food and such while they're here.  But it's a small price to pay for having such an amazing family.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you could try and just be supportive and respectful of them?
41e284c4ae4178dd7ffd2cdd7557871daa	Scam artist! Call your insurance company immediate to make sure no check has been cut. Your insurance should have not release a check until the work is completed or in a install type fashion. Call you state insurance commissioner and check with the state consumer of affair this company is based in.  If you have not signed a contract they can't hold you to it. Also consult a lawyer as the last option.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	No they cannot.

3f3c29287aa543056f2f47ef05dbdf6baa	Tell your parents that you are being punished for NOT doing drugs. Weed would show up in your system for 30 days. Ask them if they were ever the butt of any rumors when they were in school. Unfortunately parents are pretty stubborn and it probably won't work. So, I'd ask them what you have to do to hang out with your friends. Buy a drug test every month?

Nice butt, big boobs, mile long legs. you name it. but that doesnt give you the right to be talking about her like this. you say "she is about 5'4..her legs are thick..her thighs are thick too..not like fat thick, or cellulite thick". so then what exactly is the problem. if they're not fat or cellulite thick, then how big can they really be? you obviously need to loosen your standards a little or move on. from the sound of it, she is beautiful girl with an average, possibly above average, body, that many other men would love to have. <br>  <br>  by the way. are you in perfect shape yourself? i bet there are a few things she doesnt like about your body! <br>  you say she can firm up in the stomach and her legs are thick. get over it, buddy!|`|Fn6vayT4aa	because 2 years ago she didnt have full hips like she does now women stop growing at 21 . leave her alone you sound very mean and to slim your legs you need to walk and her legs prob have muscle from cheerleading your very mean and dont tell her i feel hurt for her the poor girl if you want a girl with long slim legs then go find one|`|Ve48V97Baa	go jack off to some 12year old boys, or stop being gay, your pick|`|AA10027242	Leave her.

8IyZphFVaa	well the slipping thing is kind of funny but after she started crying i would probably get worried. you need to work on being more empathetic. when i am faced with someone who is upset something automatically switches in me. maybe you could force yourself to imagine that whatever is happening to that person is happening to you. i can pretty much imagine smacking my head into concrete and it wouldn't be funny. you wouldn't laugh if it was you and you probably wouldn't appreciate someone laughing if it was you so you are doing something wrong, according to pretty much every religion that exists. it's socially retarded.|`|tGf48z8Maa	when a friend/person slips it's usually extremely funny but if their seriously hurt although it can be funny it's probably best not to laugh.<br>  <br>  and when someone's just broken up you shouldn't laugh at first, after they get over it it's alright to have a laugh (:|`|Es2u2o0Eaa	you are like this cos you need to grow up, you are a sad idiot who needs to get out on a saturday night rather than asking and answering with stupid crap on the internet,<br>  Get a life and you might start to feel like you are actually living.  <br>  I assure you the only reason you laugh at your girl friends separations from there partners is because you are very sad and jealous that you cannot get a partner.
B5WTqgcoaa	I'm surrounded with people who thinks being single suck. most of my high school girl friends are either married or about to be. I think it's down to personal preferrence. <br>  <br>  I like being single because it's easier for me to explore new things when I don't have anyone to think about except for me myself. <br>  There's actually lots of things to enjoy when you're single. I can go clubbing anytime I want, travel to anyplace anytime I want, spend my money all for myself, meet new friends especially if they're opposite sex without having to worry of anything. <br>  <br>  But again, it's personal preference.

But you often don't notice that when you haven't been in one. <br>  <br>  While you're single, you can only think of being alone and wanting to love someone, but once you have that, a lot of the time you realize it's not at all what you want.

The majority of the people who speak of how great it is to be single usually have left relationships that have gone on longer than they should have and they needed the time away from a relationship.<br>  <br>  They could also say that because you can be more "free" and "mess around" more with people of the opposite sex.

Her movie business is part of her psychological wreckage, and the demand they all watch one every night is her exercising a cult-like control over his brothers or sisters. She is a wack job that should probably be committed to an asylum.|`|AGNL0r6vaa	Its his family    <br>  Shut up stop crying      his family is more important than you
C8DOT8Y7aa	Lower your expectations. Flirting is fun, but only if you don't take it too seriously. Most of the time, you'll just flirt with someone for a short time and then maybe never talk to them again. If you always go in to flirting expecting to date or even marry the person you're flirting with, you're going to be very disappointed--and you'll probably seem a little desperate. Remember, you're just flirting. <br>   <br>  Look approachable. Relax and smile. Use your body language to give signals that you are the fun person that you are, and to show that you're comfortable and confident. There's nothing to be nervous about. <br>  Read body language. Does the person look approachable? Do they appear interested in you? From the moment you see someone with whom you might want to flirt, you should read his or her body language. Once you're actually flirting with the person, body language is often the only way to tell if the person is actually interested in you . We all have a natural ability to read body language, but it's easy to misread signals, so be careful and take it slow. If you see one signal that indicates the person is interested in you, watch for other signals that might confirm that. <br>  Make eye contact, but not for more than a moment or two. Do not stare. Just shoot the person a quick gaze, smile with your eyes, and then slowly look away. If you look back and notice the person looking back to meet your eyes, they're likely interested in flirting a bit. <br>  Initiate a conversation with the person you're interested in. If you don't already know them simply make small talk. Perhaps the best way to strike up a conversation is to start with a simple observation which ends with a question: "Nice day, isn't it?" or "This place sure is packed, eh?" are just a couple examples. What you say isn't important. You don't really need an answer to the question; you are simply inviting the person to talk with you. If the person responds pleasantly, continue the conversation. If the person doesn't respond or seems preoccupied or disinterested, he or she probably isn't interested in flirting with you. At the beginning of the conversation, you don't want to talk about anything personal. Talk about the environment around you, the show you just saw, etc., but don't talk much about yourself and don't ask the other person personal questions. <br>   <br>  Gradually share information about yourself in a reciprocal manner. If this small talk goes well, proceed to share a little information about yourself--just something small like what you do for a living or how you liked the show you just saw, for example. At some point, of course, you'll want to introduce yourself and, hopefully, get the other person's name. The key to sharing information is that you both gradually open up. Take turns talking, and each time the other person gives you some information about himself or herself, give similar information about yourself, and maybe give slightly more personal information than that person gave. For example, if you're talking to a girl who says she's taking summer classes, you might disclose that you are also taking summer classes, and then proceed to tell her which class you are most excited about. This invites her to disclose more information about herself. In this manner, the intimacy of the conversation increases over time. You don't want to share too much about yourself too quickly, and you shouldn't try to get the other person to do so either. <br>  Give the person your complete attention. Laugh at their jokes, listen to their stories, and don't get distracted by what's going on around you. It's more important to seem interested than to seem interesting, and you don't want to hog the conversation. Being a good listener is far more important to successful flirting than being witty. <br>  Use body language to hint at your romantic intentions. If things are going really well, you might want to try to break the touch barrier. Touch his or her arm briefly and gently as you talk. Or be more assertive and hold the person's hand when you cross the street, or if walking to a seat or a table, lead them by gently holding their arm. Touching in this manner helps break a "personal space" barrier. Pay attention to red flags, because some people have "personal space" issues and you don't want to make them uncomfortable. In general, women can get away with touching much earlier in a conversation than men can. Many women feel a little threatened when a man they just met enters their personal space, while most men are more open to being touched. In any case, proceed with caution, and back off if you get negative or mixed signals from the person. <br>   <br>  Close the deal. Most flirting is just harmless fun, and nothing will ever come of it. Every now and then, though, you'll meet someone who you'd like to see again and who you think would also like to see you again. Flirting is, after all, a type of courting ritual, a way to meet potential boyfriends or girlfriends, maybe even your futu|`|r8VvBxM6aa	Be comfortable and be yourself. Smile a lot.

xpcoUTYyaa	You need to go rent the movie Swingers and watch the first 5 minutes.<br>  <br>  You have to stop talking to her to get over her, and as soon as you do finally get over her instead of pretending to be over her, then she might start liking you again, at which point you really won't care anymore.|`|osoG5JrMaa	its really messed up.. for her to leave u like that.. but..if u guys are still friends.. just be urself.. like how she was interesed in u in the first place..|`|6XGYzWYbaa	u shouldnt get back at her|`|yjvv5bDjaa	go out and get some revenge-sex.<br>  <br>  <br>  dude, just move on. seriously. <br>  <br>  hurt now, heal later.
s4zxGI4naa	If YOU don't want her, then find another friend... She's so conceited about her self and I know everybody doesn't want a friend like that. Be your self, prank her about what you think towards her own "vain" self apperance and whenever she told you that "you know i'm joking right?" that that kind a hurt you or pisses you off tell her so that she'll know and she won't do it again and again and again.
mEWTWGslaa	This happened to me but i was the friend who didn't want my friend to go out with my ex.  I felt siletly betrayed for the first week but then i got over it.

Explore the things that make you happy and bring peace and serenity into your life. Cut back on the amount of attention you give to him and his needs and wants. Concentrate on yours.|`|1d87d68d27feaf630ac18e418360ae11aa	Marriage is a give and take relationship and you won't always feel that romance you felt when you were first together. That doesn't mean the love is gone. I do think that he is very wrong to be checking out singles websites and flirting with other women. That's just disrespectful to you.

He's cheating on you emotionally and that is so unacceptable.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	I used to act this way when I was young and in relationships.  It's having your cake and eating it too.  I think it's important for each partner to put the other on a pedestal, and always be faithful to the relationship first.  It's fine to have friends and flirt, but it's another thing to pretend you aren't taken for an empty ego boost or a fantasy that can go too far.  I'd tell him that the behavior needs to be modified.

What he is doing is demeaning to you and all married people.  My husband and I work hard to make sure we consider each other's feelings as much as possible.  Seek counseling, spiritual or professional, they won't approve of his treatment of you and the disdain he seems to have for his marriage.  Try talking it out.  He should respect the woman he "loves" more than that.|`|ByUS0k8waa	Well maybe he can tell you are confused about how you feel and he may also be confused about how he feels. So that being said you should sit down and talk to him. Have a good heart to heart. If you still want to make it work but he doesn't change then try some marriage counseling. Maybe that can help you both and you can find that spark you have seem to have lost.|`|0PdYYeBFaa	I think you gave TOO MUCH freedom. There is no problem with respecting ones independence. But giving him leeway...well unfortunately as a result of you not being firm..you have allowed him to think it is tolerable to behave this way.|`|oGOfioR7aa	Talk to him about it. If he's not willing to change, then he's not worth spending your life with you.|`|3frK2iHaaa	WEIRD|`|4dXcZhuTaa	divorce him, he sounds like a real dud.

(Band, sports, church, social clubs sandlot teams-what do you like to do?) talk to your parents about your feelings-hopefully they will listen to you. if not, someone suggested talking to your school counselor-that person will get your parents to hear you.

ByUS0k8waa	Its hard to get that connection when you haven't been there his whole life. I had a male best friend he was like my brother and he and I will always know things about each other that will never come up with my husband. Also he has been there beside me though more stuff so that connection is something that has grown over years. Its hard to just jump into that. The connection that a husband and wife have is different. However your bond with him is just as strong trust me. He would never choose her over you and that is what makes the bond you have together better than the one he will ever have with her. They are different kinds of bonds. Yours is so different then the one he has with her. No stronger or weaker just a bond. Nothing to be jealous over.|`|djUMvICoaa	He might have more of a mental condition than a connection.  There is nothing you can do about something like that you either have it or you don't.  but that isn't why he married you anyway was it?  He has other reasons and as long as you work on those assets (nice word, huh?) you shouldn't have any problems.|`|IGXE3aDraa	hes sleeping with her|`|kTUL01tfaa	Tell him they have memories, sure, but he shouldn't have a stronger anything with any female not his wife. It isn't healthy and it's insulting.<br>  Tell him thinking about high school years brings happy memories to all of us, but it's not reality, nor produtive & it doesn't make him young again.. I love my old friend from high school, we shared so many laughs, we were always on the same page, but my commitment is to my husband. Her being married 3 years won't stop her if she has no intergrity and wants to cheat, she also should not encourage him. They can be friendly of course but there's never any reason they have to be alone together. I think he just cherishes memories of his youth, she is not the girl he seems to think she still is.  This may go on for years, you 2 should talk to a pastor, he needs to honor the wife God gave him.<br>    That woman belongs to another man. time to grow up. There's a thin line here that can easily be crossed. Congrats on the 70! now dress alluring and be a confident woman.|`|KcOpiKiYaa	Well first you should always talk to your husband about everything.

I think you are really wondering if this is heading into a possible realtionship thing rather than platonic. If they were friends before you two got married it would be wrong of you too insist he ended the friendship and maybe even push him forward into infidelity. If neither of them has shown deeper than close friendship type of relations then it is just you that is worried. Don't let this get the upper hand on you and do something to trigger another problem. We are all going to have friends and some of them are going to be of the opposite sex. Except that and go on. I have seen jealousy put an end to many of good things. If you got a good thing going don't mess it up! Good luck|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Do you want a stronger connection because it will be good for your marriage, or do you want it only because you feel in competition with her?<br>  <br>  If she were male, would you be bothered by it?<br>  <br>  I think at some point you have to trust your spouse to be able to keep friendships friendly and save the sexy stuff for thier marriage.  <br>  <br>  Work on your mental connection with him because it will bring you closer to your husband, not so it can push his friend further away.|`|uvWuVWb1aa	I know how you feel. My husband is a 3-time published author, and his ex girlfriend from high school is also a writer. They have been best friends for years. She is engaged and has a little girl... At first I was a little jealous of their friendship, but after a while I realized that it was completely normal. She is also a writer and they can talk about things that they are both interested in. He needs that connection with someone else. If the two of you share everything in common, you'll eventually get bored with one another. Try making friends with the woman.. That's what I did, and I can honestly say that Erika is now my best friend! It's great, and we all go on double dates and spend time as couples. It's actually an awesome scenario if you look at it from that perspective. I know it's scary because she's a female... but if you trust your husband, let him know, or else you could push him away.

Any normal nice everyday person would not look at you and think you are fat and ugly, if they did then it is them with the problem. Please please get help before this affects your child too. Speak to your doctor and get them to refer you, be open and honest about how severe your problem is and it is severe, nobody should have to feel the way you are feeling right now. Love yourself, love that scared and lonely human that is you. good luck x|`|ByUS0k8waa	You need to see a Dr.You should see a psychiatrist and get some help. Maybe some meds. What you described could be a few things but mostly sounds like depression. Please on Monday call a Dr in your area and see them. They can help you to live a happy life again. Trust me your children deserve a mother who is happy and can go out and play with them. If you wont do it for yourself do it for your children. The meds can really help. My mother use to be the same way til she got to the point she had to be put in the hospital. Please don't wait that long just go in and get some help so you can become a happier you and start to love yourself again.|`|KcOpiKiYaa	wow! this is serious. no don't go to a counselor. if you hate yourself so bad then maybe you should get yourself together. lose some weight if your fat. do your hair. put on makeup. do something nice for yourself like go to a spa....don't worry what other people think of you. don't do|`|aXYiOskmaa	apparently, you can't deal with this on your own. you need a good therapist|`|RaJS65b9aa	You need to seek proffesional help.  It seems like you need to work on your self esteem.  You're describing yourself like you're so ugly but I'm sure others around you don't see you that way.  It's sounds like you have something called social anxiety.  With a proper counselling you can overcome it.  My cousin had it to the point that she was housebounded (but now she's OK) and I also had it but went through lots of therapy and reading.<br>  I know you can do it too!|`|l7NmeuvMaa	Oh please go and see a counsellor. There are different ones so look into it, but maybe a Cognitive Behavioral Therapist could help you to think more positively about yourself.

e3442b42bd59f05b36773c8ef3077c53aa	This sounds frightening and worrying, please do not leave your children with him without supervision until you feel 100% happy that he is stable. There have been too many tragedies lately. Keep a diary of events, keep any texts , suicide notes and emails, speak to the citizens advice bureau and also relate can help you even by yourself he does not have to be there. Do not feel pressured into anything , your children depend on you to keep them safe, your daughter doesn't know what is best for her she is only 9. I do not think that emotionally being alone with him is good for her, she is influenced by what he says to her and it is extremely manipulative of him to take advantage of that, this is not love. Good luck, stay strong.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	If he is emotionally blackmailing the children, he should not be seeing them at all.  <br>  <br>  I can tell you're struggling with wanting them to have a relationship with 'dad', but the relationship they have is twisted and manipulative and they are better off with NO relationship than one in which he messes with thier heads intentionally.<br>  <br>  You have reason to believe he's cyber-stalking you.  This man is dangerous.  You're feeling it, you just can't put your finger on it yet.<br>  <br>  Do your children a favor and halt visitation until he is more emotionally/mentally stable.

See if he will seek some type counseling dealing with letting go and control issues. If he does and you see change then there may be hope, however if he refuses and/or even show any sign(s) of insult or resentment at the suggestion, then, until he has completely gotten over you, I suggest you move or whatever you need to or can do to never allow him private access to you or your children.
8afb688e78b320f9009e3ee53b0b0c78aa	Hi there, you and your boyfriend have both obviously been through problems in your past and maybe in a way thats why you have been drawn to each other in the start of your relashionship. You are 17 and having a long term relashionship under your belt already is a big deal espically as your 17 and starting to want to find out who you are and what you want in life. <br>  <br>  Yes you may still love him and care about him, but are you in love with him? Thats the difference here, maybe you feel sorry for him being in care or maybe your sceard to let him go as he seems to rely on you for emotional support. You need to do what your head and your heart says.<br>  <br>  Maybe have a break from each other, a cooling off period and se how you feel about things a few weeks later. Take this time to start finding who you are and what you want from life and from a partner.<br>  <br>  I would not recommend you to start another relashionship right now as you probarly are just finding comfort from the attention your getting from this other guy because your feeling so down and confused by your current relashionship. You wont find the answers with another guy right now.<br>  <br>  You will and can find the right answer within your own head and heart<br>  <br>  I wish you all the best|`|jPsQecBNaa	i think you should end it because, although you may still love him, does he still make you happy? Can you imagine yourself spending the rest of your life with him?|`|Y4dr9Wfmaa	dump him and come live with me|`|PjlhgQ3uaa	what is he in care for , that would help maybe you should take a brake and wait for him to get cared or treated or whatever and then start it up again , take each other out and do some daring stuff like stealing next doors chicken or happy slapping yobbo punk kids it might spice things up ,take a break see how you feel ? theres no point being unhappy
ByUS0k8waa	You have to get over the other guy before you can love another. Its not fair to the guy that part of your heart is still with the other guy. Also if there isn't that spark then he isn't the one for you. He's a nice guy but not the one for you.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	If you still dwell on your ex. you will ruin every guy that comes along. Get over it already. No sparks will fly until you do.|`|95f078ea7d11192207a5cbc225861070aa	Its normal to think about your ex and what could of been, but believe he is NOT thinking of you.  You are so used to men that treat you badly; that when a good guy comes along (like your current boyfriend) it fells foreign to you.  You feel like you don't deserve it, or worthy of it but you are everyone is. So stop thinking about what could of been and focus on what will be.  Or your going to lose this guy. Then he will be the ex that your thinking about when you get with another guy.  To much baggage girlfriend let it go!  GOOD LUCK|`|uvWuVWb1aa	There's no chemistry, and no matter how hard you try, you can never make the chemistry appear.

I caught my husband that way, and there was also some awful stuff that came across the computer when I was on it. I'd open something and there explicit photos were.  It almost broke us up.  At the time he had no sex drive and he said he was trying to arouse it.  I told him never again.  <br>  <br>  I'd be more concerned even if it were males or was looking like kids.  You know where even 18 year olds are dressing like school girls. I'd steer clear of that totally.<br>  <br>  You know you can't trust him and that he lies.  When they lie convincingly it is even more difficult.  Had a problem with my husband too in that way.  He stole my vicodin and denied it, but I knew he had as I counted them.   Later he took some and denied it and were at psychiatrist and told him and he asked if he'd take a drug test and he said yes.  Then asked if it was going to come clean or not and he didn't know and then admitted he did take them.  So I know he lies.  But he has a mental problem and I feel more like a mom anymore.  Lies destroy trust and a marriage and love.  I can't trust him.  I lock our meds in a safe.  No money in there, just meds.  If I were young, I wouldn't want to do this. I'm not young and we sort of watch out for each other, but I know I can't trust him.  I am living with that because I do care for him.  But we don't really have a marriage.<br>  <br>  I don't know if he is worth it or not.  You could have him get counseling.  Problem is that unless counselor is conservative he might not see that as a problem, though the truth issues should be.<br>  <br>  God bless  you.  My ex has his porno magazines and I found some in bathroom where our son might see it. I was mad about that. He eventually cheated on me - once and I forgave and then again later with someone else and he didn't feel he loved me anymore.  I think the porno magazines can mess up marriages and give an unrealistic expectation - all the enhanced and fake bodies.  Might stimulate you both for a while but ... If he cheats on you that way, will he cheat on you with a woman later on?  <br>  <br>  Maybe you need to go more slowly while you think about it or you work it out.  Could someone else have been in  your home to access those files?  if not, then I'd say he is lying to you as history is where you visited on the computer.|`|EaCkHmFPaa	So?<br>   At least he;s not "doing" annything honey.|`|8afb688e78b320f9009e3ee53b0b0c78aa	Get over it|`|rvA9BXehaa	First of all, you have made it loud and clear that there are some issues between you two. Clearly you folks have a complicated relationship, as do most human beings in love. When emotions and hormones get involved, it become difficult at times.<br>  <br>  That being said, this is yahoo answers, so I am free to make my snap judgment if I desire...<br>  <br>  You two are repressed sexually.<br>  <br>  What a man and a woman do in the privacy of their own homes, or elsewhere if everyone involved is a consenting adult, is entirely the private business of the man and woman involved, or men and women, or... as the case may be. Sometimes the people involved, the man, or the woman, will desire some sexual satisfaction on their own. Men are visual creatures. We enjoy viewing sexual imagery while we are producing our own gratification. It is natural. It is enjoyable. Everyone involved can enjoy the experience, as long as certain taboo behavior is not involved.<br>  <br>  Ah, what is taboo?<br>  <br>  Ultimately, the two of you need to define your taboos for one another, and then stick to them, unless further definition/re-definition occurs between you.<br>  <br>  Talk. Find the way to help each other enjoy your sexuality. Don't be afraid to take some risks. You'll be glad you did.

I had a close group of friends and I grew apart from it. You sound like a very nice and smart person, and I'm sure you will meet people who you will be close with. I've heard most people meet their life long friends in college, and I was never able to go.,<br>  <br>  You are 14, and things will work out. I have noticed that people like to be around people with confidence, and a sunny disposition, so try and keep it positive, not too much complaining, etc. I'm sure you will make lots of friends. And try and get out and do stuff on the weekends, to meet new people. When you get to high school, and you're a freshman, you can befriend sophmores and juniors, because you're mature, and you'll be considered cool and popular for it. Good luck.|`|9LJjNYaMaa	nothing is wrong with you. making friends is a two way street. they are prob wondering why youre not trying to make friends with them. set up a myspace or facebook. that helps a lot. and ask ppl to hang out and do stuff. better now before youre 21 and drinking at a bar alone|`|0ycoeVpZaa	i dont think there's anything wrong with u. im sure there's other people at ur school like u with whom u could make good friends.

Be who you are, and be confident, smile and be nice.<br>  <br>  I'm sure there'll be LOTS of new people in high school. And i guarantee you will meet new people.<br>  <br>  :] Dont worry, it's only temporary.|`|Ekg4H6HQaa	I think that you're just at a more mature level than everyone else, and believe me, that's one amazing thing. It's rare but I would talk to you more than any of the other kids in your school. It's true that kids are "stupid" in so many ways, but that's life. It doesn't make you less worthy of being friends with. You would have to look for people like you, and if you can't find them, why not start a group where you would be able to meet people your age who aren't into what everyone else is into and then you would have a nice amount of people you can call friends. <br>  <br>  You could ask the people you call acquaintances if they would like to see a move with you on the weekend, or things like that. If that doesn't work, don't worry. You'll find people. Maybe this alone time is what you need to allow yourself to grow even farther and learn. There is nothing stopping you from making friends of those acquaintances, though. Nobody's perfect and it's nice to have variety in your friendships. Otherwise it gets boring.<br>  <br>  -- See? The first person to answer is like you and gave you their e-mail. You're not alone. Maybe you guys can start a nice online group for teens just like you.|`|raQe8rFjaa	no there isn't something wrong with you... you propably just havent got to know people much. you should start conversations with people, by just asking them simple questions! you can make many friends like that! and eventually you will have plenty of things to do on the weekends!|`|80a25c311005b72de6ae7f5054547233aa	no i dont think theirs something wrong with u..<br>  when i read your thing it kind of remind me of how i use to be.. <br>  i think you should talk more maybe start low from asking about a homework to a different person every day or week and try to make conversation with them after say hi or nod at them in the hallways <br>  i would suggest to dress nice and feel preety that will automatically give u more strenght or confidence to make new friends..<br>  and need to take it easy its okay to be stupid sometimes..=}|`|n9d7dWaAaa	There's a girl like you at my school too. There's this timid, smart, and pretty blonde girl in our group. She's VERY quiet, well she hardly ever talks, and just (most of the time) follows us around. We're really nice to her though, sometimes we may forget about her, but we don't leave her out. <br>  <br>  I can tell she's not as boring of a person than she is really, because on MSN, she talks differently...like an extrovert.<br>  <br>  Lol, people are stupid at my school too. Listen, 5 or 6 years ago, I used to be quite quiet. But people always talked to me, and in grade 6, I finally broke out of my shell and I talked a LOT. Then I got to grade 8 and I had lots of friends. I was quite popular, and everyone liked to be around me.<br>  <br>  My advice: YOU should do the same. Let people like you for who you are, and most of all, be a happy person! (i'm REALLY happy all the time :) But friends in school aren't that important just yet, wait till you get out of highschool and into uni/college, that's where you meet your REAL friends. Good luck!|`|wGYEgOr9aa	First of all, We're pretty much the same age! :) I turned 14 a week ago! :P<br>  <br>  I understand what you're going through, I'm the same way but I have a few close friends left who haven't turned their backs on me.. Don't worry, There's nothing wrong!<br>  <br>  You could try talking to people who seem less immature and annoying then the rest. You could also try a number of things such as joining different clubs or start lessons for something that interests you, call up some of your acquaintances for a party to get to know them better / hand out invites, Ooh and if you take the bus you could try sitting new places and starting up convos with the people you sit by :)<br>  <br>  Best Wishes! :P :)<br>  Let me know how things work out!
3f3c29287aa543056f2f47ef05dbdf6baa	I would talk to her about it. That is an extreme breach of trust, but if you're best friends it might be able to be worked out. I'd go have fun at the festival, and ask about it later, just say she left it up, and that it's none of her business to be telling him things about you. Maybe she was trying to get you two together? I wouldn't think the worst yet. Guys come and go but friends might just last forever. At least give her a chance to explain. But I see why you're mad, I would be so pissed. How are you supposed to trust her now? Ahhh good luck, I feel for you.
0ycoeVpZaa	yes. Im a girl and my best friends are guys. I hav girl friends too but i get along with guys so much easier. I cant say i've nevr made out with any of them though.|`|AA12349214	Yes it is.<br>  Men make the best of friends you know.  They are less catty, less inclined to discuss your private business with other individuals and are much more forgiving if you happen to have a snarly day.  They dont cling and are much less needy and are always there for you.  They dont try and compete with you but are just there, an equal walking beside you.<br>  I've had a male best friend for the best part of 20 years.  He has long outlasted my female friends by miles.<br>  I know of men with very very close female friends - they love each other so much and are there for each other.  No funny business either!<br>  It sure can work and is marvellous when it does.<br>  And it means when you have a man friend in that position that if ever you need a 'partner' for some do and the husband cant make it, well you have a ready made walker for the evening.  Perfect!<br>  Sex doesnt always have to raise its ugly little head and spoil it.|`|AA11646252	Yes.  Just have to let your friend and your other half also be friends so that they know what is going on between the two of you.<br>  <br>  rd|`|pHbRV4FNaa	Yes! entirely! i used to do that all the time...my bf didnt care at all...but of course it depends on your Bf/Gf if they think it is a bad idea...then i guess it is lol...|`|SUJBPm1maa	yes<br>  my ex had a best friend that was a girl<br>  they were also exes<br>  i was completely comfortable leaving them alone together and when they hung out <br>  it was a sort of "brother/sister" relationship|`|p7HaGkQUaa	Yeah, alot of the time that situation is more like a brother and sister relationship so it is possible x|`|AA11411905	Simply enough, yes it is<br>  there is absolutely nothing wrong with this as long as they are aware that the love you speak to them is a friendship/family kinda love, not relationship love.<br>  <br>  But I don't think you need to feel any need to fear, you'd be amazed how useful someone of the opposite sex is when you want difficult questions like, what do girls/boys generally like, I was going to ask *blank* to this movie, what would you think if I asked you that?<br>  <br>  hope this helps!|`|Dg7qHtecaa	yes. both of my best friends are guys. i just seem to get along with guys more then girls. and i tell them i love them all the time.|`|jq6ujoqfaa	totally,my best friend is a Guy and i would tell him i love him in a totally platonic way.|`|eU2xTwVzaa	ya my little bro tells this girl everyday he loves him and she is with another guy but its Cool he says he always looks at the bright side i know she will come around for u dud
kknCZkq0aa	Just tell him. I was in this situation a couple months ago, I just told him, and we're still best friends today! He didn't freak out at all, and it makes me feel like I can tell him everything no matter what. Just ask him if you can talk to him, or walk up to his locker one day (if you are in school) and say I need to talk to you. <br>  <br>  I know you can tell him, if you guys are best friends he will for sure understand and not get freaked out. Good luck :)|`|DmgArIu7aa	If I were you, I would tell him how you feel even if you tell him through a friend or peer it might make it less awkward.|`|3f3c29287aa543056f2f47ef05dbdf6baa	It sounds like the friendship is coming to an end if you like him and admire him that much. Girl/guy friendships are 99% going to fail anyway, so I'd just go for it. Tell him that you want more. He probably feels the same way about you.
3f3c29287aa543056f2f47ef05dbdf6baa	Never tell friends something embarrassing in public, just take her aside and tell her that you're trying to save her from future embarassment. Apologize for doing it in public. Please in the future only tell people embarassing things when you guys are alone. I can only imagine how she felt being called out by other people, as well as her good friend.|`|eTlw3a7raa	hey ...i knw this is going to sound a bit weird but try chewing exageratinngly ( if that is a word ) with your mouth open infront of her so she sees how disgusting it is or like get your whole table to do it ...she might get a bit offended bt you know if she has morals she'll realise that what she's doign isn't right  ...and dont worry your not ruinning her life thats just exageration lol|`|AA11286455	You've told her and told her.  Forget telling her again since it obviously doesn't work with her.  <br>  <br>  --She's sensitive and cries?  Toughen up and let her.  Bc she's also being controlling of all of you to get you to back off.  <br>  <br>  --When you're together at the table, and she leaves her mouth open, turn away and refuse to look at her.  <br>  <br>  --Ask her, as a group, to please go eat at another table when she first sits down and remind her why.  <br>  <br>  Again, you ALL need to toughen up and be consistent with social pressure. This is likely the only way she'll learn to appreciate and RESPECT what you have to say and your limits.
eb9a693cbdde8fd29f4eff3ed378d62baa	you are dealing with a control freak.  he is playing with your emotions to try and gain control.  you need to be strong.<br>  <br>  Do not bring a child into this world under those conditions.  You have a baby when you are ready to care for it for the long haul with a father that will be there for the child.  <br>  <br>  You have to let him know in no uncertain terms its over.  You don't have to be mean or drive him away, but its not your responsibility or power to control what he does.|`|OHfZFR31aa	You don't stay with someone because they threaten suicide. He is either really mentally ill and you need to contact the mental health authorities and his family to report him. Or he is just doing it to try and emotionally blackmail you<br>  <br>  In either case you should not stick around. If he is really suicidal, he will kill himself whether you are there or not. It is not your fault. Otherwise he's using it as a control mechanism to use you.<br>  <br>  Get your child away from that situation - it's not healthy for either of you.|`|ByUS0k8waa	You need to have a good heart to heart with him. Sit down and talk and tell him that you can still be there for him as a friend but nothing else. You need to move on with life. Just remember to be his friend since he will probably need someone. Also maybe make him a appointment to see a counselor or a Dr about the depression. They can help him and when he becomes less depressed then you can move on from being his friend if you no longer wish to even be friend with him.|`|aMlxa7Ksaa	He's threatening suicide as a way to control you.  Let his family know that he's thinking about this and then move on with your life.  As for the abortion, don't do it.  There is a long waiting list for adoptable babies and your baby should not suffer and die because you got yourself into a bad relationship.  Give your baby life and a loving family.|`|52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	Contact the authorities.  ALL suicide threats should be treated as serious.  The man needs help.  Either for suicidal ideation or manipulative passive/aggressiveness or (at the very least) better coping skills.  It is NEVER your fault if someone commits suicide.  Forcing the issue to the authorities (police) will help him and help yourself in the process.  <br>  <br>  In the end be VERY clear that you do NOT feel the same way about him, you will not be contacting him again, and will not be accepting any contact from him.  If he threatens suicide, call the police IMMEDIATELY and tell them what he said and you fear for his safety.|`|1k7LIZVWaa	He's a controlling coward who would never go through with this "suicide".  It really makes me mad when I hear desperate control freaks who use this tired and worn out tactic to try to get what they want in life.  Get away from him and try to make better decisions going forward when it comes to choosing men.  Therapy may help.  Take care of you and your daughter.|`|mVJVUxSzaa	There is no easy way to say good-bye to someone you care about. The best way is to just do it. Do it as simply and as nicely as you know how and move on. That may mean you will have to discontinue all communication for awhile to allow him time to get his self together, but in the long run, it will turn out to be the best route to take.|`|AMtl5coXaa	If he says stuff like that you tell a doctor and they will take him away and make sure he doesn't do all that crazy stuff. You just do what you want to do and move on but make sure he doesn't kill himself by telling someone.|`|NB4h4jTyaa	If he actually commits suicide, it is not your fault or responsibility. If he's going to do it, he will.<br>  <br>  Suggest he see a counselor, but he can no longer see you.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	When someone threatens suicide it's best to let the family and loved ones know about it.  That is the first step, and you don't have to explain the situation to death on a personal level, just let them know he is threatening suicide, period.<br>  <br>  Secondly, you are not responsible for anyone else's happiness on an adult level.  While i am sure you regret things didn't work out, they just did not, and you need to move forward with your own life.<br>  <br>  It's not a crime to make a healthy decision for yourself.
n8lXItGraa	It sounds like it's already gotten too far...he loves you.  Tell him how you're feeling and why.  Right now you're living a lie...do either of you deserve that?   If you don't feel for him what he feels for you, you need to let him know.  There's no easy way to do it.  He's going to be hurt, there's no way out of that unfortunately.  Be honest with him...tell him what's not working as delicately as possible.  You deserve to be happy with the man your with, and if your not...time to end it.  He deserves the same respect.  You don't need a good reason to end it...sometimes it's just not right and there's nothing that you can do to change that.  Love isn't always a smooth ride.   Hope this helps...|`|ByUS0k8waa	Just sit down and talk to him. Im guessing you don't feel the way he does and he deserves to know that. Just be very honest with him and Im sure he will appreciate that. That is the best way. If you want you can try to stay friends.|`|veZLfnGFaa	Talk to him and just explain things.  Tell him that you just want to be friends.  That's about as easy as it gets.  (He is still probably gonna be hurt, though.)
veZLfnGFaa	He never broke it off with her.  Let him go.  You can beg, plead, scream, cry - but nothing is going to stop him.  You don't want to live like this.  You will be better without him, than with him.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Unfortunately too many men think that if their woman takes them back, then she forgives him, and will forgive him if he cheats again<br>  <br>  You need him out of your life because he is not going to change|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	I hope some of this makes sense to you.<br>  <br>  The basic idea behind hedonistic thought is that pleasure is the only thing that is good for a person; indeed: the only good. This is often used as a justification for evaluating actions in terms of how much pleasure and how little pain (i.e. suffering) they produce. In very simple terms, a hedonist strives to maximize this net pleasure (pleasure minus pain).<br>  <br>  So, in the act of cheating, the cheater often ignores the negative consequences of their choice (temporarily favouring the pleasure), and then, when caught, they lie (minimize the pain from any guilt or other punishment). Eventually they may fess up, and present with remorse. Don't be fooled. They are just not able to provide any more lies or arguments to support their dirty deed. They admit it all just to shut you up.<br>  <br>  Selfishness denotes the precedence given in thought or deed to the self, i.e., self interest or self concern. It is the act of placing ones own needs or desires above the needs or desires of others. By itself, this is neither good or bad. It is of course our capacity to be 'selfish' that I am pointing out, and it is a choice, because there is healthy selfishness as well.<br>  <br>  Typically however, selfishness is viewed as the opposite of altruism (selflessness). Women are socialized to be caretakers, to be nurturing and to be the ones responsible for socializing children. A man's job is to 'provide' the financial resources for his family. It goes beyond that of course. he becomes a role model to his children. Together, both parent do.<br>  <br>  It's entirely human to have moments of weakness. By that, I mean, our morals slip in favour of that moment of pleasure. It is, at that moment, a failure to recognize the real challenge, to stay true to ourselves (long term gains), and decline the offer of infidelity, thus remaining true to your vows and your partner, and your family.<br>  <br>  Your marital vows, to be with your partner, and only your partner in an intimate and loving way, is a moral commitment. There are legal aspects to violating these vows, and those issues show during the divorce. We make these moral commitments and by so doing, we surrender certain 'freedoms'. Such as the freedom to be with another partner in a sexual and intimate way. If we don't come to terms with our need for personal freedom before we make these moral commitments, we struggle with these issues throughout the course of our marriage. This often shows itself as well, in the differences between healthy relationships, and unhealthy relationships.<br>  <br>  I hope you are able to use some of this information to get the understanding you are looking for.|`|ByUS0k8waa	Once a cheater always a cheater. That is why. Also have you thought about the fact that he must not feel bad about doing it or he would have got the point the first time. Don't you deserve someone who loves you and wants to be with just you. He must be more in love with her then he is with you or he just doesn't care that it hurts you. Have you thought about that?! I mean really thought about it. Just because he was your first doesn't mean that he has to be the last. My pastor preaches that the only reason for divorce is adultery. Well it wouldn't be a sin for you to divorce him. Either that or you better just learn to deal with it because nothing you say or do is going to make him change his mind or his ways. <br>  <br>  Also you can try marriage counseling but I doubt in this case it will work. My husband and I agree that the only reason to ever get divorced is if one or both cheat. You just cant get past that to us. You can never trust him the way you use to.|`|BqqDJXkjaa	You said it yourself - you can't / won't be with anyone else. So why shouldn't he have his cake and eat it to? <br>  <br>  Lets make one thing clear - sleeping with anouther person is fun for him (exciting, different) and it will be for you to. You can be with another person, in fact you clearly should be. <br>  <br>  If you stay with his him this time - you'd almost be encoraging him to doing it again.|`|LS8LcuRaaa	If someone cheats something is not right in the relationship. Most men cheat because of the sex. You need to find out why he cheated on you and try to solve the problem. Sometimes people grow apart or meet someone new, if this is the case it may be time to separate.|`|OfBG0jNjaa	Full me once, shame on you, full me twice, shame on you.|`|AA11370698	Betray me once I forgive: betray me twice i kill you.

I think if he doesn't then that will be your answer as to how much you mean to him.<br>  You can walk away knowing you gave him his chances or maybe he may realise after a while apart what an idiot he has been and how much he really does miss you. You can't just forgive him again and carry on as normal if he hasn't changed.|`|f58ec99bd12e60acd134f41c8821665baa	He is going to keep doing this,because you will forgive him.<br>  <br>  Tell him that you gave him the last chance to change.Don't let a man walk all over you.It is to clear that he doesn't give a care about you or even have any kind of respect for you.You are better off without him.Don't let a man make you feel as if you are nothing and that you should be there for him to walk all over you.<br>  <br>  Divorce him and let him go to her.She will soon find out that he will do what he did to you to her.Good Luck  and Keep your head up.|`|7b5d7721387ea9716cf48828f5d4cc1caa	There's no way you can understand why he does it but perhaps because you took him back the first time, he thinks he can get away with it. You need to leave him, stop communicating with him and then see what happens. It'll give you some time to understand what you want out of life and hopefully he'll fight for you back.|`|OfhzZriSaa	well, he probably got the vibe from you that it was ok, you let him get away with it, pretty easily as it seems.  take my advice:  DONT take that bullshit.  he's cheated on you twice, two seperate occasions, do NOT take him back, it was not a "mistake".  respect yourself and divorce him, and find someone who is actually deserving of your love, time, and energy.|`|aMlxa7Ksaa	He cheated again because you took him back!  Time to find a good divorce lawyer, charge him with adultery and take him for everything you can.  You will eventually get over the hurt and find another man that will love you the way you want.|`|41e284c4ae4178dd7ffd2cdd7557871daa	As long as your willing to take him back he's going to keep doing it. Is he really worth your life and your happiness?

So if he is cheating again then leave him he does not deserve you, and you need to find someone who will appreciate you.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	Once someone cheats, it's very likely they will do it again.<br>  <br>  Maybe it's time for you to make some tough  life decisions for your own happiness.<br>  <br>  i'm sending all best wishes.|`|R3XWitoEaa	He doesn't love u he just knows u'll always be there so he knows u willl forgive him, u can't live like this!!

I promis you that being alone is better then suffering the heartach he has caused you. the moment you leave him he will go right to her arms. the best revenge , is to leave him and act happy when he begs for you back, dont go back, he had his chance with you and he blew it. and for you dont waste any more of your time on him. focus your energy on yourself and when you are ready find a new love it will happen. not all men cheat........good luck|`|VG2X9Ihkaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  I am really sorry to read your story.  You have given him more then he deserves.  I think, you need to collect as much information i.e. emails, text messages etc from last time if you can and this time but don't confront him, just yet.<br>  <br>  When you have enough evidence, kick him out.  I know it seems easy for me to say but trust me, it is for the best.  I have been cheated on by my ex-wife twice (I waited till I met the right person to loose my virginity and I thought my ex was the One... lol).  <br>  <br>  I forgave her the first time but second time, it was over.  I thought that I couldn't live without her and I went through hell of time with anger and insecurity.  But in all honestly, I know that I am better off her.<br>  <br>  I am now married again and have 3 lovely kids and my life can't get any better then this.<br>  <br>  He is a cheating pig.  You forgave him but I don't think he respects you enough to give up.  Some people just can't keep in their trousers.  You gave him your virginity, your love, your soul and all you have.  He has not respected you and now it is time for him to get that something different from that B.x.x.C.H and in turn lose the best thing ever happen to him.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|djUMvICoaa	I'm sorry but I think he knows he's holding the trump card right now, he knows you won't leave him.  What does he have to fear losing under those conditions?  And he knows it right?  And if he's not happy what has been done to make him happy?  I'm sorry but once a dog always a dog, and right now you are just a little treat where he now has a bigger and fresher one.  No one can tell you what to do, but as long as you stick to your no divorce stance, he is going to bury you and any love you might have left like an old bone.  He's left the marriage, he isn't going to be committed to it again like you have been.  You love is going to die a slow agonizing death staying where you are.|`|e3442b42bd59f05b36773c8ef3077c53aa	You are worth more than this, he is a very poor excuse for a man and you are a beautiful person, loyal and trusting , do not let him abuse you like this. The little baby your mother once held in her arms did not grow up to take this, she grew up to be loved...and this man doesn't love , he takes and he destroys, protect yourself and move on. It seems impossible now but you will be loved again. Look in the mirror, look into your eyes , see the pain you feel and promise yourself you will not take this anymore.|`|d842e7iUaa	I really don't know what went on in his head but you should confront him then drop him and move on. If you drop him, it will hurt at first but you will feel better after awhile and you move on.|`|GbZuiPu3aa	He won't change.  I have gone through the same thing for 14 years of marriage and 21 years of actually being a couple.  We broke up 9 months ago, and he's been telling me how sorry he is, and how it will never happen again, and unfortunately I was starting to believe him (and ended up sleeping with him) only to find that now I am the "other woman" and he's seeing someone else (Who btw has 4 children! So goodluck with that, he wasn't even a good Dad to his own Kids) He won't change, and he will keep lying. Cut your loses and leave.  You don't say if you have children or not. So count your lucky stars if there is not any kids involved, as it is heart breaking for them.  RUN...AND DON'T LOOK BACK!!|`|RN1wGlWWaa	I'm so sorry that he broke his promise and cheated again.  IMO actions speak louder then words - he never really was sorry or intended to stop.  So you have no choice - you can divorce him because of adultery.  <br>  <br>  If you don't, then you cannot complain when he continues to sleep with others.  He broke his word and his vows to forsake all others and be faithful to you - and both of you need to deal with the consequences of his actions.|`|3qLIRorjaa	He did it again because you allowed him to when you took him back the first time.<br>  <br>  Take him back again and he'll do the same a 3rd time etc because he knows you'll keep on taking him back.
AA11972752	You seem to be stuck on the formality of calling it love or friendship. Whatever you call it, here's the reality (without the title): It's obvious that you care about her and she cares about you. This is true, because 1) You say you're falling for her, and 2) She gets really upset when you break it off with her and she is really into you when you're together.<br>  <br>  You say you care about her, but your ease of breaking it off may not be showing it. In contrast, her actions show she cares, but she doesn't want to say it. It's an interesting dichotomy.<br>  <br>  There may be reasons for why she is afraid to say it. Maybe she's afraid that those feelings won't last and she's only willing to say it when she knows yours is a long-term relationship that doesn't break at the first sign of trouble?<br>  <br>  If you really need the formality of saying "I love you" and calling each other boyfriend/girlfriend right NOW, then you'll have to break it off.<br>  <br>  Maybe, as an alternative, you could try a little patience and you may get exactly what you want then. It's not a guarantee, maybe she'll never come around, but you never know until you try. I can't say that I completely understand her fear of calling you boyfriend and girlfriend, but I also can't understand your fear of giving her the time to come around, either. Maybe you both fear the same thing, that it won't last, but it seems in reaction to your fears, you're making it happen!<br>  <br>  Maybe you should re-think your decision to break up with her over this.|`|ByUS0k8waa	I think she really cared about you the reason she was so upset and doesn't want to loss you. So maybe the two of you could work it out now that she knows you mean what you say. Why cant the two of you be together?! I would talk to her about it. See what she has to say. Maybe she will be willing to be with you instead of losing you. To her you are more than just a friend.|`|D3hYbsVJaa	You were being used. Although, give her one way to contact you, but make it clear this needs to change if there's going to be anything.|`|0PdYYeBFaa	If you feel you are better off without her then by all means just continue with the path you are trying to walk along. If you feel she is only going to hurt, confuse you and you can not handle a mere friendship..maybe it is best you be apart. <br>  <br>  Ask yourself whether you can deal with it or not? (think reasonably and clearly)

I was crushed. he was the love of my life. and at first i just kept thinking he would come to his senses and ask me back out. but then like 2 weeks later he got a new grilfriend, and you would think that i would get over him then. but i still couldnt. It took me like 6 or 7 months before i could get into another relationship. i mean i did have one fling but it didnt work cause i was still attached to my ex. now when i finally got into another relationship it only lasted a few weeks. probably because i still was over my ex. now that was december of 2007 and honestly im still not completely over him, and i've had like 3 or 4 bfs since then. And what i've found is when you really care for someone you cant just move on, it takes time. every day will get easier. now its been a little over a year and even though i still have feelings for him, its easier for me to be in a relationship now that time has passed.<br>  <br>  So just dont worry, its normal to still be attached and not want to be in another relationship just yet. the wounds are still fresh or so to speak.|`|a074aac3ad17521564085d29e2af8d4faa	Anytime that you lose who are completely when you are with someone it is a dangerous thing. You need to remember who you were before him and who you want to be now without him. Although it seems like it he is not your entire world, First loves are tough to get over, but someday you will.|`|8lMb2w5Vaa	I understand wat ur going though i've been there && yea it sux But if u to were really ment to be he'll come bakk if not it wasnt it but dnt beg him to come bakk hes gna think dat u like kissing *** Talk to him as friend && see were u'll get..<br>  worth a shot|`|8gvsUlUyaa	Beat him up. That will make you atleast feel better. When you see him just sneek up behind him and hit him as hard as you can.|`|EaIR89pbaa	It depends on your age|`|B4MHj9u0aa	listen to my chemical romance<br>  they will make u forget him|`|q0NFNzt2aa	I am in the similar situation like you. He still loves me but he is even leaving the country to forget everything. What can I say to you when I am struggling with so many questions in my mind, why why why?<br>  I can just say that if he loves you enough or if you could fit to his imaginary picture of his favourable woman, he will stay with you, otherwise he will leave you, today or sometime in the future.<br>  You guys might even love eachother for whole your life, but it doesn't mean that you can keep him to stay with you.<br>  You could tell him all your feeling, then you won't regret in the future. You could ask him what was wrong that he left, then if you can modify the situation or accept some changes, why not. But, as I said, this doesn't warranty anything. The problem is that guys like challenges. They like to do effort to take something. If you (like me) were so available for him, for any possible situation, he gets bored easily, and runs away.<br>  Try to find out the reasons. At least, you will know why!|`|xOwwmQ44aa	well, you're never gonna get over your first love.<br>  you're always gonna have that little lingering feeling that you still want them there.<br>  but all you have to do is pretend like it doesn't bother you and little by little the pain will start to go away.<br>  if he broke up with you and he is still telling you that he loves you, then you need to tell him that you're trying really hard to get over him and that him telling you that is just making it harder. because it probably is.<br>  and just continue to live you're life as happily as you can because you will find somebody, trust me. :)<br>  and you won't jump right back into the dating stream, but you'll get it back soon enough. :D
MtQ9ea2Uaa	I would just move on. Maybe get in contact with him later and talk about it and try to work things out if you feel you're up for it. (I'm guessing you are) I honestly think he said all that to let you down gently, just move on..|`|sJTPzFdlaa	Give it a few more weeks. Then email him and ask how he is. It sounds like he does want you back but doesnt want to make a mistake by getting back with you too quickly.
6lBvoHxqaa	He is thinking of you as "his" and wants to be assured by you that you are not with any other guys. Its a way of reminding you that he is there in your life and he doesnt want you meeting anyone else.|`|RvddYKqjaa	It means you need to turn off your phone and enjoy the friends you are with.|`|ibeVcQyWaa	ASK HIM.|`|SzubaKbuaa	I have the same problem!!! I don't have an answer, but I wanted to let you know you're not the only one!! lol|`|06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	He is checking up on you. Sounds like he likes you for more than a friend and is worried youre going to fall for some guy. He is keeping tabs on your activities. You need to confront him even if I am wrong and tell him to stop it and ask him why he does it.
MtQ9ea2Uaa	Ugh. That is absolutely terrible. The exact same thing happened to me.. I hated seeing them being angry that a few weeks ago that used to be us and that we look at each other like nothing ever happened between us..<br>  <br>  I know it's a terrible feeling and it's going to be really hard but just act like it's not bothering you at all. You're happy, okay, not heartbroken. Because he obviously isn't since he has a new girlfriend and everything. Get yourself busy, keep your mind occupied, hang out with your friends even family. Your friends should understand how devastating this is for you and will help however they can to get your mind off of these things. Hopefully some of your closest friends from that group that you hang out with will break apart and hang out separately with you at school.|`|sFqsTXvwaa	Aw, I've been through that, too. You won't wake up one morning and suddenly be over it. The only thing that'll heal you is time. Focus on your friends, and a new crush might help distract you, but other that, it's something that has to happen on it's on.

XCrcItD3aa	Congratulations my friend, I am happy for you achievements. I do hope you will continue to accomplish more.<br>  <br>  I think that if a woman was not fond of you when you were fat and nerdy then it is sort of hypocritical for her to be interested now. I think that one should love a person for who that person is, what he or she denotes, their character, personality and so on but not for money, looks and other unimportant things.<br>  <br>  All the best from Zedon
3Zad0UuWaa	Maybe you should just try to be your natural self, and stop placing a front on yourself. Your obviously not getting asked out bc everyone can see through it, or bc your friend is tall.
AA11263103	1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.<br>  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.<br>  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.<br>  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.<br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?<br>  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!<br>  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.<br>  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.<br>  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.<br>  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then he may like you - but if the topic is something serious, he may just want to know out of curiosity.<br>  13. He'll flirt with other girls to get your attention- If a guy is really into you he will want to make you jealous. So, he will most likely flirt with other girls in front of you. It gives them a chance to see your real self.
70kJJJ7uaa	Move on. She doesn't like you. Try starting a conversation with a REAL LIVE girl, instead.|`|OqBkdIfFaa	your right, you will look like a creeper. Wait for her to reply then take it from there.

You should have probably greet her, and more off if you know you've never seen her!<br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  <br>  Moe|`|sp1TB35Kaa	Say whatever you want. You don't go to the same school, so if you say something embarrassing, it's not like you have to see her in person. Just be yourself, and start with a compliment.|`|FBeUGR15aa	just comment a pic of her saying she looks nice, then send her a msg saying something like, "you're very photogenic..unlike me!" cheesy?? some think so, yes. But it works, trust me!
ynj2FPAgaa	Well I could understand if she was mad at you for a while, cause that was kind of a dick move... but if she says she still doesn't forgive you and you don't care about her, then I think she's holding a grudge. As long as you apologized and tried to show her that you do care, you've pretty much done your part. But if you still want her, I guess you could buy her something (not necessarily flowers, but something nice or something that would make her laugh. not perverted though... okay just stick with something nice) and try talking to her more and stuff. But yeah like someone else said, if she was annoying you on the phone then what about if you two started dating? Plus the whole fact that she's still mad at you for leaving her on the phone one time. And you were sorry after, I think she's just... being stupid. So if you do get her to forgive you, think about it before you maybe consider dating her. You don't want to dread being with her all the time if she's annoying.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped at least a little bit. Good luck!|`|xpcoUTYyaa	She's an idiot if she's gonna hold that against you.  Tell her to chill and not be worried about something so small.  And then do something cheesy like say bye to her like 10 times next time yall talk and say you are making up for it, and she'll laugh and hopefully forgive you.|`|XBwLbqO3aa	that was pretty dumb. if u liked her, u wouldnt have hung up on her.<br>  <br>  answer mine<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090307153640AAL1ic3">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|6lBvoHxqaa	Give her a couple of days, or maybe some pretty flowers. Either one of those will do the trick. Apologize and you will be fine.|`|pTx24BC8aa	this made me giggle. i think she is the immature one here. I think you were doing the right thing in getting off the phone with her when she was annoying you.  who knows what could've happened?  if she got so annoying you couldn't handle it, you could have gotten angry and yelled at her or you could have said something that hurt her feelings.  Now if those things had happened that would've been a reason for her to not forgive you or say you didn't care about her.  <br>  I think by getting off the phone you did the right thing.  <br>  <br>  why don't you just tell her that she was being a little over the top for you and you thought the best thing to do was take a breather, and actually you do care about her b.c you thinking of her feelings and being considerate so that nothing got out of control. <br>  <br>  ? it would work on me :)|`|gGyNLWDzaa	yea apologize and just explain to her that you were cranky and wasn't up to talking on the phone and that it meant nothing. also explain to her that she does matter to you and if that doesnt work i say get her flowers or something and just ask her out, it will definitely show her that you care about her<br>  good luck!|`|qlJAC8kOaa	YOU are so CUTE!!

26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	It's his wedding too so he should be able to make decisions. If you're not getting married in a church, I don't see what the problem is.

Furthermore, I  don't think anyones church will  falter if the sounds of rock emanate from its doors.|`|QdQcAHqaaa	Unless you are powerwalking down the aisle, this song is really going to be awkward.  I'm all for using rock songs at weddings, but there is nothing about that song that matches the ceremony: not the setting, the occasion, or the timing.  Something a little slower (Black Hole Sun, not that I'm suggesting that, but something at that tempo) will fit better.  Lollipop works better at the reception....like when you present the cake.|`|rsR1O730aa	YES! use it, if its what you guys want to use then of course do it.

To me a recessional song is the way to set the tone for the remainder of the wedding day.  Some people use instrumental, which is normal and personally boring.  But if that's what their reception would be like then it makes sense.  If it's your favourite song, he likes it, your family understands, and your reception will follow in suit then do it!|`|f4HsyUfQaa	Your family knows what type of people you are.

If there is a processional and recessional, then you are having an aisle and full ceremony. You are contradicting yourself. Either that or you are "using" a church just for pretty photos. Which is it? If you are having a traditional marriage ceremony then rock music is an insult to the church, the preacher and your guests. Keep it for your reception.
md5K2IiIaa	You might just be attracted to a certain 'type' of girls. I know for a fact that there are so many girls out there that want nothing more than to settle down in a steady relationship with a nice guy, but on the other hand, many are simply enjoying the single life and the benefits of emotionless hookups that follow. When you first meet a girl you can usually tell what her intentions are depending on how sexually overt her actions are and also if the physical aspect of your interaction seems to outweigh her interest in conversation and getting to know you. Also, when you first start dating girls it might be helpful to start a friendship rather than jumping into the sack and then transition into a more serious relationship.

I would certainly hope that you're not having sex with these guys you date because that's an easy 20 years in jail for the guy sweetie - especially if you get pregnant.  Whether or not you have/use protection, you can still get pregnant, and it is still against the law.  Don't turn into a tramp or a ****.<br>  <br>  As for why you are so attracted to them?  Only a psychologist would be able to find out for sure.  Make an appointment.
C8DOT8Y7aa	As you work your way through this transition, some of the time you'll be purely emotional -- simply grieving -- and some of the time you'll be more thoughtful and rational. Depending on your mood of the moment, here are some basics that may help you to think about the place you're in now, how you got here, and where you're going: <br>  Examine what happened, and ask yourself why. Don't assume that it's all about you. You have to make it clear to yourself that this is not entirely your fault - or maybe it's not your fault at all. Really thinking about the reasons it ended can make it clearer to you that it takes two people to start a relationship, but one discordant person is enough to end it. It may also help you avoid missteps in the future if you can identify areas where you contributed to the demise of the relationship. <br>  Don't rethink your decision. If the breakup was your decision, bear in mind that thinking about all the good times you had may cause you to forget the reasons why you broke it off. By the same token, try not to second guess if the decision to end things was not yours. It's very common to romanticize the good parts of a relationship, convincing yourself that maybe the bad parts weren't so bad after all, that maybe you could live with them. Or that maybe if your ex could know just how you feel, s/he wouldn't want to break up after all. Don't play this game with yourself. Accept the situation and work on moving forward. <br>  Keep your distance. Even if you and your ex have decided to stay friends, take a complete break from each other immediately after the breakup. This means not seeing each other, no phone calls, no e-mails, no Instant Messaging, and most definitely no sex - not necessarily as a permanent measure (except where sex is concerned), but until you feel that you can converse with him/her on a purely platonic level, without an ulterior motive (and yes, wanting to get back together counts as an ulterior motive). If he/she tries to convince you to see him/her, ask yourself honestly what the point would be. If you're reliving the past by seeing him/her, it's not hard to get caught up in the moment and it will be harder to let go again. The longer you put off the end, the harder it is to stick to it and maintain your resolve, and the longer it will take to really get over it. Your pain will hold on as long as you do. Practice letting go. Let go. Let go. And now... let go. [You may have to have some contact in order to deal with the practical aspects of things like moving out, signing papers, etc., but try to limit this to what's absolutely necessary, and then keep such calls/meetings short and civil.] <br>  Accept your pain. Have good long cries. It's okay to be hurt and sad, and it's ok to be alone. It's ok to feel like you have messed up -- accepting responsibility for your mistakes or shortcomings is healthy. On the other hand, you must also accept that you are a good person, and that you did your best and you're not the only one who made mistakes. Of course, a stage of denial is completely natural, but acceptance is the key to being able to begin to move on. <br>  Think through everything thoroughly, but not obsessively. Go ahead and mull it over, as many times as necessary, within reason. Consider all the reasons you two broke up. Even if it sometimes seems as if there wasn't a good reason, there certainly was one - and probably more than one. Understand that you enjoyed being together for a while, but if the relationship was not what both you and your partner wanted for life, it would have ended eventually, no matter what. In this case, better sooner than later. <br>  Deal with the 'hate phase'. This is where you want to just scream because your rage feels boundless. The amount of anger you feel depends on how antagonistic the split was, the circumstances (was there infidelity? That makes it worse), and how long it took to make the final break. You may resent your ex for wasting your time. You may realize that the breakup was inevitable (hindsight will reveal clues you failed to notice at the time). You may even feel a lot of anger towards yourself, but let go of that feeling fast! It's a waste of time and energy to rip yourself apart over something you no longer have the power to change. There are so many positive things you can do with your emotions and energy. <br>  Talk to your friends. You want people around you that love you and who will help you learn to love yourself again too. Surrounding yourself with compassionate, supportive friends and family will help you see yourself as a worthwhile, worthy person, and you'll find it easier to get steady on your feet again with your loved ones around you in a comforting net. Be wary of friends trying to connect you with another person, this is not what you need right now. <br>  Write all your feelings down. Write in a journal or write poems. Most of all, be absolutely honest and don't edit yourself as you go. One of the best results of writing it all down

ff27c578abd6f97b50c76f87e94ae774aa	You're not stupid. You felt guilty and did the right thing. What he did was wrong. You probably still have feelings for him though. If you try to just be friends with him, you will realize that. It's hard to make a relationship work out the second time around, there was a reason it didn't work the first time after all. Not to mention if he did that to her with you, he'll do it to you with someone else. People don't really change in that aspect. It would be best to just stay away from him for a bit until you're both over it. You can try to be friends again later on (a few months from now maybe) but if you keep talking to him, it will just frustrate you.|`|dK6YGyNyaa	Don't get drawn back in - you say you want to be his friend but you know you'll end up getting back with him because you've fallen for him so bad. Put your best friend first, and cut yourself off from him. It'll be better for you that way. If he cheated on your best friend with you, he'll cheat on you with someone else. Stay strong, good luck.
AA11972752	I'm a Gemini and he's an Aquarius. I find that we get along most of the time being that we're both intellectual types and have interesting conversations. When we have disagreements, it's usually over personality, not ideas. We agree on ideas. But I find that I'm more carefree, and he's a more anal-retentive worrier at times. His sign is future-looking, so that may explain why he gets so tense at times, worrying about the future.<br>  <br>  Those are sun signs, though. Don't forget that moon signs can matter, too, since they represent the emotional and inner aspects of yourself. My moon sign is Capricorn and his moon sign is Virgo. I haven't done much research on how our relationship lines up (or doesn't line up) with those signs. However, I know they're both earth signs (concerned with practical matters) and they're considered compatible signs. So technically, both our sun signs and moon signs are compatible.<br>  <br>  What I've also found interesting is taking tests that figure out what astrological sign you are (or should be) based on your personality traits. I didn't come up as a Gemini! I came up as a Cancer. Well, I was a premature baby, and if I had been born on my due date, I would have been a Cancer. I think I have both Gemini and Cancer traits.<br>  <br>  My ex-husband was a Sagitarrius, which are considered opposites on the astrological wheel, and we were definitely opposites in some ways. We argued a lot. I can sympathize with the description of it being like a roller coaster. It was interesting, not always good, but not always bad, though ultimately it didn't work out in the end. Sometimes opposites can just butt heads for too long.<br>  <br>  Hmm...

It's simple tradition that some people choose to follow. Most women I know were/are too happy to accept their husbands' names. Would that make these women selfish?|`|AA11525464	No, they are not selfish, it is a matter of former legal practice and tradition.<br>  <br>  Under the Common Law of England, which was in force in many parts of the United States for longer than you might think, when a woman got married, her husband acquired ownership of her personal property, and the use of her real estate, during the continuance of the marriage.  Also, the law considered husband and wife to be one person.  Thus, the tradition of the wife taking the husband's surname seemed to fit right in logically.<br>  <br>  The law also required the husband to provide financial support to his wife, and did not require the wife to support the husband, so in view of that responsibility, the husband was given authority over the wife and her property.<br>  <br>  Nowadays, marriage is more a relation of equals, so it is not going to swing so far as having men take their wives' names, but as other answers have pointed out, it is generally a matter of custom, and there are some men who take their wives' names, or couples who hyphenate their names, or, a lot of times, each party will retain his or her own name.|`|AA11972752	Nah, I don't think they're being too selfish. They're just too afraid of what people will think if they do things differently from everyone else - so they're being conformists. Most people are conformists to a certain extent. Some people are a lot conformist, some people are a little conformist. There are very few people who don't care AT ALL about what people think. There are people out there like that, but I think the majority of people do care at least a little bit about what other people think and so that's why you see conformist behavior.<br>  <br>  For men, it's easy to demand it, because that's what everyone else is doing. For women, they're either conformists too, caring about how they appear to other people, or even if they're not conformist at all, they just don't care about the issue enough to fight over it with their husband. So that's why most women take their husband's names after marriage.|`|c07v7O80aa	It's cultural. We carried it over from Europe. Even there, it's not hard and fast. In some places, families are traced strictly through the matriarchal line, and the husband is essentially no longer even a member of his mother's family and becomes fully a member of his wife's and no longer associates with his original family. It's just the way it is there. And we do not require wives to take the husband's name.

Don't get angrey about it - you'll get no where, :)|`|Ag0jb7Neaa	it's just a tradition<br>  there are some places that do it differently|`|7cdc801bdb4ad5ebfe07957d02070809aa	Changing your last name after you get married is an old tradition that has been around for a long time. Whether the wife takes the husband's name as tradition dictates, he takes hers, or both make the decision to hyphenate. They have to follow state laws to make it official.|`|0e5aeac0b9db1edd4e79c50eed3109f2aa	I believe it is just traditional (and maybe a little bit of male ego) I work with a guy who has taken his wife's name and hyphenated his. We all think he is secretly gay, (lol) but he said it is so their children can represent them both since they all use the hypenated name.|`|GHH1i6d3aa	Until recently, women didn't have many rights.  They were passed from their father's care to their husband's.  By taking his name, it showed her placement in the community.  Now it's just a tradition, which people like because it shows family history.|`|VG2X9Ihkaa	The latest trend in UK for married couples are that they mix letters from their Last name/Sir name.
xtvs4B7Jaa	yes, because you should not break up with your friend because of your crush. I'm having a problem with a guy and it would be sooooo much harder without by bff<br>  the thing is: she'll be there for you in the hard moments and you'll need her help, and now, even though she did that to you she needs your help|`|67qWgasgaa	Maybe she didn't want you to be angry with her if she liked the same guy as you. A lot of times, when you tell your friends who you like, it draws attention to that guy. It kind of sucks because girls want what they can't have, or shouldn't want, and that's just one of those cases. I'm not saying never tell anyone who you like, just be aware of who you're trusting. Forgive your bff, she just didn't want to hurt you by telling you she liked the boy, this drama will always be around, so if this was the worst thing she has done, I doubt she's a bad friend in most moments. Now about your crush, I know it stinks that he doesn't like you, but is it worth it to like like a guy who makes fun of your friend? When guys are confronted straight up about who likes them, it's embarassing and can come across as a little too forward, so it may be a little bit awkward now..|`|dT8tbGrLaa	you will forgive wether you want to or not<br>  <br>  (if she is your reall bff)|`|79OM9Wcjaa	if shes your best friend, a guy shouldn't come between you 2 ; but i have to admit that was rude to do such a thing. (: i say talk it out.|`|lNeBUxkGaa	well if she is your friend then yes. you too may have fights in the future but you too will always be friends|`|58ScqWG3aa	take back your bud and ditch the guy|`|2P5zkLnkaa	you should just like who u want. even if ur friend likes him too. The same thing happened to me. I forgave my friend and told her how I felt. we never really talked about him for awhile. then we were comfortable talking about him. We both still like him and tease each other about who will marry him!
7mvo2cghaa	I dont think waiting for him is the best thing to do.  i sympathise with you here as i am in the same position some what.<br>  <br>  Walking away is harder than it sounds (i know this cause i find myself waiting around for a guy myself) but if he is only saying these things because he doesnt want to lose as a friend then that is harsh on you.  <br>  You should speak to him first and ask him how he truly feels and whether it would be worh waiting for you.  At least you will know how he feels even if it is not what you want to hear, but this has got to be better than getting hurt later on after you have waited for him.|`|lTvU9wxfaa	Ahh,just be yourself!<br>  People will like you more,because then they can feel like they can be thmeselves as well around you.<br>  Too much drama!!!!!!!!!|`|KYCqcm1Eaa	Go for some one new he is ur trash and u need to let him know that breaking up w/ u was the biggest mistake ever!|`|FtD7KDfpaa	I wouldn't move I would Definitely wait and see how he feels about you|`|qlJAC8kOaa	Baby girl, STOP IT!! He ever wants you or he doesn't.  Stop thinking about him and go out and have some fun.|`|6lBvoHxqaa	This is very similar to a friend of mine, I am a guy and I have been seeing a girl for a few months. We have been friends for ages and decided to try going out. But now I wish we hadnt, cos I just dont like her in that way properly and I have said that I am not ready for a relationship and that I think we should take things slow. This is only cos I dont want to lose her as a friend and I think that maybe in time I will feel for her. <br>  <br>  I think this is the same as he is doing to you, I hope not for you cos its not a nice thing, but I dont think he wants to hurt your feelings by telling you how he really feels.|`|DjuTSbeqaa	Tell him that you are willing to take the chance of getting hurt, because if you're already hurting, what do you have to lose? Don't jsut sit around waiting, but don't forget about him, either. If you wait too long, he could be gone. He likes you, and you like him. Forget about the other complications that may exist. Go for it!|`|Ix4wLPJ5aa	Keep with him! He obviously likes you alot.  Try to sit him down and talk to him deeply about where you are in his heart.  He may even love you but broke up with you because he is confused about love.  Keep with him because if someone loves you there he will always have a place in his heart for you.  Stay!!!  He wan'ts you and you should stay.|`|67qWgasgaa	Yeah, he's a drama queen or he's stringing you along.|`|0Uo20SmWaa	Suggest to him that you want to stay in touch with him by text messages, E-mails, and even some phone calls. Then see how it works out.|`|UebWhbD6aa	i think that waiting for him is point less, if u move on and find  someone u like, maybe if he still likes u, he will tell u , because he will be jealous|`|91aDQQ66aa	Why are teenage gilrs such drama queens?  Seriously... I don't mean to be rude but just be with him!|`|8erwvNjwaa	your bf is a jackass point blank.|`|4nZZbrKgaa	try to talk it to him and tell him your having trouble too. then you can work things out. it would just be best if you just told him how you feel because it seems like you guys are kind of in the same situation. It's obvious you like him so i would wait a little.
mefxIQP9aa	OMG, are you serious?<br>  <br>  Me too. I'm 5 feet. Very young looking. I'm 20 but get mistaken for a young, high school kid. Slim body and baby face.<br>  <br>  I'm dating a 25 year old and the youngest he looks is 18. LOL. We get stares once in awhile and sometimes looks of disgust.<br>  <br>  I don't think you should worry about it. Just be happy that you look young. When you hit 40, you'll probably still look like your 20.
AA11263103	1. Examine his body language. If he likes you, you may see that he rarely turns his back to you, often leans towards you, and also looks at you a lot. Both his feet will point towards you if he's comfortable with you, but if he's uncomfortable with you, one foot will be pointing at you and the other will be pointing at another girl.<br>  2. Notice his eye contact. If he likes you, he may either look away quickly if he is shy, or he'll try to catch your eye and hold it or make faces. This can be uncomfortable if you don't like him. If you feel like you have held eye contact just a fraction of a second longer than you would with anyone else, or if he looks away quickly, then there is something there. When he's around you and he says/does something funny and everyone around laughs, his eyes will flicker towards you for a second to see if you laughed, too.<br>  * His pupils may dilate if he likes you, but this is quite hard to pick up on, and you might come across as acting strangely by looking that closely into his eyes. If you're around him for a long time, it could be easier to pick up on gradually.<br>  * Hint: If you like him, your pupils may be dilated. Check a mirror, then see if his eyes are similar.<br>  3. When a guy likes you he will try and make himself seem impressive to you.<br>  * Listen to what he's saying. If he likes you, and he's nervous, he'll probably start talking about himself. Many times, guys feel the need to prove themselves- especially if you talk about another guy in his company.<br>  4. Be aware of touching. He might put his hand on your arm when he laughs, and won't move his leg if it happens to touch yours, or he may hug you for small things - all are good signs of a guy liking you. But be careful because this may be a result of him just being nice to you and not fancying you.<br>  5. Watch for him showing interest in things you like and do. For example, if you like a certain genre of music that he likes as well, he may suggest bands or artists for you to listen to. Another example, if you play sports he may ask to play against you just to show off that he's good at something you both like and then also have a reason to give you compliments as well.<br>  6. Notice the way he treats you - does he playfully tease you, or call you names, just to try and get your attention? It's natural for a guy to tease when he likes a girl, but remember, someone can still tease someone, even if they aren't attracted to them. Also, keep in mind that some guys simply will not tease you.<br>  7. Check for signs of nervousness Nervous laughter, sweaty palms, deep breaths, fidgeting, looking away quickly when you notice if he is watching you are all good signs of an attraction towards you and that he is nervous about making an impression on someone he fancies. Also notice if you call his name, does his head snap around right away or does it turn gradually?<br>  8. Smile at him- a big smile in return is a good sign. Also, see if he always ends up in the same part of the room as you; perhaps he keeps going out of his way to bump into you and to flash his smile in your direction. If so, then smile back!<br>  9. Pay attention to his friends. If they know he's interested in you, they might tease him subtly when you're around, hint to you that he likes you, or even try to find out if you like him. Study their reactions to your presence - do they smile? Do they turn to him? Do they smirk in a way that suggests they know something that you don't? Maybe when they dare him in games of truth and dare, they always dare him to do something to you. If so, then there's a good chance that they know that he really does like you.<br>  10. Be open! Give him room to approach you and talk to you - it can ruin the situation if he hasn't got any opportunity to do so, for example if your friends are giggling in the background, or you are never on your own.<br>  11. Pay attention to how many times he uses your name. If you talk to him often, watch how many times he uses your first name. People tend to use your name to get your attention, and it shows that they think about you! For example, if you say something, and he replies with "ha ha, nice, [ name here ]" it means he thinks about what he is saying more than if he replies with "ha ha, nice." The second doesn't mean he doesn't like you, but using your name is usually a tell-tale sign.<br>  12. Notice his behavior in conversation. Sometimes when guys ask you questions and other people distract the conversation or cut him off, he'll just forget about it. If you notice that he keeps asking or changing the subject back to the question until you answer, then he may like you - but if the topic is something serious, he may just want to know out of curiosity.<br>  13. He'll flirt with other girls to get your attention- If a guy is really into you he will want to make you jealous. So, he will most likely flirt with other girls in front of you. It gives them a chance to see your real self.|`|gK6QV1sWaa	I Dont Think He Lieks You. He Thinks Of You As A Friend With Advice.

BZzWlI6eaa	it sounds like he is more interested in you than the other girl, she sounds a bit too controlling. I would talk to your crush about it and ask him what he thinks of the other girl (if you can)...but I wouldn't give up on him 'cause it sounds like he really does like you<br>  good luck!
jOLtcXufaa	no it was not right to react that way, if its something u 2 do occasionally then its something u do, and where u do it as well, most ppl celebrate special occasions by drinking or smoking and she felt like it was what she wanted to do that night, i kno personally from being high, shes not drunk or anything where she could ruin ur night, she just happier

6Rru2901aa	I think before you jump into conclusions you should review the tone of his voice when he said it. You didn't give us as a lot of details, so you're going to have to figure it on your own, I will however say this, if he was disgusted he would have told you he was, guys are pretty straight forward and they will have no mercy when it comes to telling you the truth - in that manner. it's okay, calm down.|`|VMAI9uG0aa	If he was disgusted, he would most likely not have said anything. I think he was just pointing it out because he did not mind being on the topic of that general area. Don't worry too much about it.

SxI6y9GWaa	I suspect you are about 13 which makes him about 23.  Your poor brother.  He lost his mum in his early teens and was saddled with a little sister who he feels terribly responsible for.  Your father, as he's away a lot, probably told him time and again to look after you so it's ingrained in him now.  You are at an age when you want to do thinks on your own and unfortunately, he feels like a surrogate father with no experience of fatherhood.  When you are living with him, do as he says.  If you are likely to be delayed coming home, tell him before you leave the house so that he doesn't panic when you don't turn up on time.  Maybe your dad should take a bit more responsibility for you.  You are at an age where you are likely to do things which you think are sensible and mature but in reality, aren't.  When you are 23 you will look back in horror at some of the things you are doing now and will have a bit more sympathy for your big bro.  He obviously cares for you so be kinder to him.|`|52332e62000ac0a2cad78200a89d809aaa	you need to first reliaze tht he is doing this because he loves you and feels responsible for your well being. what you need to do is sit down with him and have a heart to heart talk with him. tell him how you feel, let him say his part. then reasure him that you are growing up (or grown up) and need some freedom.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|OQsj0Am3aa	Tell him he's making you so miserable that next holidays you're going to go a stay with a friend instead.<br>  <br>  Next time he's going off at you remind him that you already have a father and don't need another one.|`|b1256d852b56b556e6bb26806d1c64eaaa	You could ask to have a word with him - but I'd say you were lucky to have a brother like that, as most brothers wouldn't care about another sibling. Also, it depends how old you are - if you're only a teenager, he WILL feel protective towards you.|`|Z5ereta1aa	tell him hes not your father and he cant control you, so dont listen to him. ( unless hes being reasonable...)<br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  the rice bunny <3|`|9Duha1k4aa	It is probably him trying to make a sweet gesture. It could be from the guilt because he felt like he should've been there for you, and now he is making up for his absence by being over-protective. <br>  <br>  You need to sit him down and tell him about his behaviour. It's not nice. You could tell him in two ways.<br>  <br>  Mean, harsh approach : "I've coped for so long without you OR dad, I can do it now. Just let me be!!"<br>  <br>  Nice approach : "I know you probably do these things because you care about me, but it's OK. I can look after myself. I still love you, but you need to stop this madness..."<br>  <br>  etc.|`|zdu3gh8jaa	Firstly, say thank you. Thank him for letting you stay in the holidays, thank him for watching out for you, thank him for loving you - then sit down and talk with him. Make some rules and compromises between you. You understand where he is coming from and try to ensure that you take on board ALL the dangers he points out to you. He needs to understand that you are growing up and need some independence. Perhaps in the future if you even think you may be just a few minutes late, then ring him and let him know. He sounds like a caring young man that wants to know that you are safe when you are in his care. Perhaps he doesn't like having to act like your father but because dad is always away working, he feels he has no choice. Unless you talk you will never find out, nor will you ever sort things out. I hope all goes well. Good luck.

pASaoHZSaa	Be everything, and more. But remain calm, and be yourself. I'm in eighth grade also, and I think I fell in love. You are never to young to love, and people are too quick to judge. So, what if she's the right person for you and you're not for her? If you really like her than you'll want her to be at her happiest, always, so before you make your final move..think things over. You wouldn't want her to think that you're selfish, but I'm happy for you that you think you have found "the one". Good luck with all of itt(:|`|8WyQH3RVaa	Girls at that age are usually attracted to bad guys. It doesn't mean that you actually have to be a bad boy it means that you need to exhibit the traits in a bad boy that girls are attracted to. Which is confidence and mysterious. <br>  <br>  A girl wants to be confident in herself but at that fragile age it may be kind of hard. Therefore girls are attracted to guys that are confident in themselves. Dating a confident guy makes them feel better about themselves. And an confident guy is just a little revolting. For example: A not confident guy doesn't like himself enough to "take charge" of the relationship while confident guy likes himself enough to plan the dates and make the moves. However, don't confuse confidence with arrogance you must find the in between. <br>  <br>  Girls also need a challenge in a relationship. They need a guy to be some what mysterious. Guys shouldn't tell a girl all of his feelings right away. So even though you may think she is the "perfect for you" don't let her know that. It may freak her out a little. And DON'T tell her you love her unless you have been dating several months.|`|ej8iwJzqaa	well, how long do you think she will be "perfect for you"?? you're a baby !!! why dont you start by telling her how you feel, but honey, i think you're kidding yourself if you think you're gonna marry her.. things change, and ppl grow different, apart, and up...<br>  <br>  you need to have a convo. w/ "miss right", but as time goes by, dont be shocked if you learn that she is miss right now,not miss right.. good luck, but you are so young enough to have a good time w/out being or even thinking about anything other that dating|`|rNE7XAmgaa	It's not about getting her to think your perfect, True love is fulfilled by both sides.<br>  <br>  If she is right for you, she'll already feel that way. You can't force love.|`|9d06cffec852de9a7554521403313f02aa	hahaha, if you can answer that question, my friend, then you make sure to let me know.  that's puzzled the minds of men for ages.  <br>  <br>  honestly, though, I don't think there's really anything in particular that you can do or say to make her have feelings for you...just try to initiate conversation with her as much as possible and pay attention to how interested she seems in talking to you.  if she just sort of shrugs you off or gives you short answers, she's probably not that interested, but if she actually seems to be glad that you're talking to her, she very well may be.  try to think of some things you could talk about ahead of time.  are you in any classes together?  if so, maybe you could talk to her about the homework for the class...it doesn't really matter what you talk about, really, just that you initiate some sort of conversation.  beyond that, though, there isn't really much you can do to try to get her to like you; most likely, she already knows whether or not she's interested.|`|PPlLiMuJaa	u should tell her that you love her and that you want to be with ha forever. im in the 8th grade too and all i want from a guy is love. tell her that you think its time you guys started going out cause you want her so bad. if she says no and she is the perfect girl for you, that means she not ready for that yet. give her time and she'll come around. if she doesnt then she isnt the right girl for you.|`|NtSQcyHLaa	You can't make her feel that way, she's going to feel however she's going to feel about you.

Also, give her nice compliments...just don't make rude ones about her boobs or anything. Girls that aren't hos hate that.|`|qlJAC8kOaa	First off you are so sweet!

In fact, most adults don't know yet either (even those who got married!).|`|kIM2Brx9aa	You can't get someone to think that.

jRa5ksWSaa	AT LEAST a month before prom. Especially if she isn't already planning on going. Finding a dress can take time, and it will help you rent/buy a tux too.<br>  <br>  Everything else really depends on what kind of girl I think. Make it something special to the two of you. Like something you have in common or you know she likes.<br>  <br>  Something not to do: Talk about going to prom in general with her before you are about to ask her. Most girls will not realize you are going to ask and may end up saying something along the lines of not going and not really interested in going, even if they are. And if you want to do that, make sure you still ask her. It may seem like a good idea to do that to "get a feel" if she wants to go with you or not, but most girls are oblivious to the fact that you are doing that until afterwards. (Trust me, I've done it and so have many of my friends.)|`|uEYckSYVaa	4 weeks before <br>  when your out on a date, take her to a movie then dinner and ask her at dinner<br>  make it romantic<br>  and dont just say hey.<br>  it all depends but be like<br>  just say it nicely !<br>  good luck<br>  <br>  like eg. dont jut see you some time like at coffe and be all hey|`|wRuWQA8Yaa	Yup. uve pretty much got it. I'm not that much of a girly girl though, so i guess it depends who you're asking. if a guy walked up to me and said "hey, will you go to prom with me?" that would b fine with me. just be yourself when asking her. good luckkkkk

v0ra606Laa	One things is for sure don't let this turn into an obsession as she may find you very weird. Why not  break the ice by one day just saying to her " I hope you don't mind me saying this but you are very beautiful" at least this will let her know that you find her attractive without sounding smutty or desperate, she will probably be very flattered and would not forget a comment like that.  Make eye contact with her when passing her and say "Hi", once she recognises you more she may start to talk to you. When you talk try not to talk about boring things like college, ask her what she is doing at the weekend or what she like to do, but don't start start asking her out on dates until you are sure she feels the same. You must remember that she may never find you attractive in a sexual way and you just have to accept that. You should first of all concentrate on building a friendship. Good luck, don't forget there is someone for everyone.|`|FgSTHArKaa	i honestly dont think she is interested<br>  girls do that all the time<br>  but whatevs. :) you will find someone <br>  its impossible to fall in love in a month by the way<br>  so it is just lust<br>  the real thing is too precious <br>  so its simply just silly lust|`|PPA30E8naa	get her msn and then take it from their|`|AA11899313	Den, this is just a wall of words which makes it difficult to read ~ when not broken up into paragraphs.<br>  <br>  I would find you very difficult to believe you if I were to hear you say, 'I have fallen in love with you ....hahaha' ~ which is what you wrote at the beginning .....> Please help for the sake of love LOL.<.<br>  <br>  There is no 'technique' that you are asking about, there is getting to know someone through talking with that person.<br>  <br>  My guess is that you are a teen and have yet to learn that these type of emotions are fleeting and can easily change into something else.<br>  <br>  The baseline is, if you want to get to know her, then you'll have to talk to her ....or send her a copy of your CV.<br>  <br>  Sash.

I2gat01haa	No. you should get married when you want to.|`|Qas05nZraa	no you can marry anytime you like|`|HQsmRzPsaa	i think it is up to you. my fiance and i and now 23 and have been together for 6+ years. we got engaged in december and planning out wedding for june 2010. his brother and his fiance been together for about 2-3 years, they are 27 and got engaged in august. when we announced we were engaged his brother said to me, "so you guys going to get married in 6-7 years like us too?" and i said , "no, we are going to get married in a year or two" now my fiance's brothers fiance is pressuring him to get married sooner but he doesn't really want to yet. although i didn't mean to cause any problems or "rock the boat" for them, it doesn't really matter. our relationship is different from theirs and if we want to do it sooner then we will. it shouldn't affect them or their relationship. i think if you have a small wedding a year before hers it shouldn't be stealing her thunder|`|RuKK1LYiaa	No, it shouldnt matter who was engaged first or not. you get married when you want to and dont let anyone tell you any different. Congrats and Good Luck to both you and your sister.|`|qkiNLmPeaa	i think you should just have your wedding. its okay to get married before your sister. if she is still planning her wedding then let her wait until next year, because she wants every detail to be perfect. since you want a small wedding you could have that. besides your sisters wedding is in a yea from now.<br>  &&<br>  congrats to you and your sis<br>  :]|`|zmqN0M86aa	No offense, but from what you're saying in your question your sister sounds like a whiny self-absorbed brat.    I would understand if she was getting married sooner or if you scheduled your wedding a week before hers, but that's not the case.  It would be very selfish of her to ask you to wait a year and a half to get married.|`|mldo1vxYaa	Technically she didnt get engaged first if you have already been married. Anyhow, I can see where you are both coming from but as you say you only want a small wedding and while she may have got engaged first you and your partner have been planning on actually marrying this year for over a year, you may not have been engaged there for you didnt tell anyone you were planning on getting married.<br>  <br>  Its a tough one as I know you dont want to upset anyone but I dont think you should have to wait, she will still have a year of being in the spotlight. Its all a little childish but you have every right to get married if you want, just tell your sister while you might not have been engaged you and your partner have been discussing marrying this year for over a year, and when she anounced her engagement you both had already planned on getting married this year you just hadnt told anyone, so you shouldnt have to change your plans because she is getting married next year.|`|PREUMGZiaa	omg people need to get over it. if you want to get married, then go ahead and get married.

Go ahead and have the small ceremony you want with your fiance soon and don't worry what the rest of the family says.<br>  As you noted, your sister has about a year to plan her big event, and with yours over, she and everyone else can focus on her per her wishes.<br>  However, hopefully your sister and her fiance will participate in some premarital counseling.  A wedding is a big day, but the important part is the long term marriage after wards.  By focusing exclusively on the build up and the big finale of a wedding, she is setting herself up for a monster let down when after all the festivities, she is "just" a wife.<br>  The goal for both of you is a happy marriage for the next 50+ years, so a little matter of the anniversary date seems like a small thing to fret over.  Good-luck.|`|AA10050051	So, let me see if I get this straight: you and your fiance are getting married this summer, which is about 3 or 4 months from now and your sister wants for you to wait until way after she gets married and that is over a year from now? Really? And, better question, how is this taken away from her? When 2010 comes, and it is June, considering if she is still with her boyfriend, then it will be her time and her spotlight. She is just jealous because this will be your second time and she feels that since you already had "your" moment, why should you have a second one. <br>  DO NOT change your date for this jealous girl! Enjoy your wedding. And if she gives you lip or  anything, I would think you or someone else would put her in her place.|`|U1chPjvPaa	Your sister is acting like a baby.

She will probably have a baby on each hip and divorced anyway!|`|eN5xA6RKaa	get married when you want. like you said its a whole year before your sisters wedding, she may be mad at first but when her wedding comes around the spotlight will be on her. my sister is sort of angry with me because she is older than me and has been with her boyfriend longer but im getting married before her. its just a sibling jealousy thing, she will get over it.|`|niq3ETl0aa	You are right and they are wrong. but you may not agree with my reason. You've been living with your boyfriend with children. It's absolutely the right thing to do to get married ASAP. In a proper ceremony. think about your children not the rest of your family. I speak this not from a revengeful heart but a pure heart. We aren't even suppose to live together so what you are doing is commendable. The sooner the better. i couldn't even take comunion whilst I was living with my boyfriend. This is a no brainer. it'd be different maybe if it was your first wedding. You go girl. Congratulations to you both!|`|XpWjdPg2aa	No - don't worry about it. You shouldn't have to wait to have your wedding. Your sister will come around eventually, anyway.

Who knows what tomorrows holds. I would hope that nothing bad would happen to either of you, but you never know. And that's why you shouldn't wait.<br>  I think your sister is being a baby about this whole thing. Her day is a year away. Your wedding is not going to interfere with her wedding at all. <br>  You shouldn't have to put your happiness on hold for a reason as silly as this. <br>  Go ahead and have your wedding.|`|igH1dP4laa	This is your wedding, take it and run with it, get married whenever you want to|`|NeBub9xDaa	no that is just he fault, tell her not to go ure wedding if she doesnt like it, its her fault anyways|`|237f7b8deabaa8cf367ed76288106f19aa	No, you are not wrong to get married a year before her. She will have plenty of time to have her "it's all about me" moments. The family may be upset, but they will get over it, especially before her wedding. Just sit down and have a heart to heart with her and be stern. Tell her that you and your fiance don't want a big wedding and want to be married as soon as possible and its in no disrespect to her and her wedding plans. You planning your weddings together could be a good bonding experience.|`|4Hv0i2Y8aa	So what if she was engaged first? You guys want a small ceremony, which would not require you to wait for a long period of time. Therefore, your wedding would happen first. It's not like your wedding was scheduled for a few weeks before hers, which would inconvenience your family for having to choose between one wedding or the other. It's an entire YEAR apart. There is no inconvenience, and when you get married is your business.<br>  <br>  Nobody owns the calendar for the months/years between their engagement and their wedding or get to dictate when anybody else they know can get married within that time.|`|93b9efecd6ca82bff2f4e552457b1bd7aa	Well, your sister sounds quite immature. If you were planning to get married a couple of weeks before her wedding I could see her point.<br>  <br>  She has an engagement that is a year and a half long and you getting married now will keep her in the spotlight because yours will be long forgotten by the time she has her wedding.<br>  <br>  No, I don't think you are wrong or breaking any huge etiquette. People who get engaged and have an engagement that lasts for years should not be surprised when someone comes along and does it faster. A lot can change in a year let alone a year and a half.|`|CBIjh0A8aa	Do what you want to do. Why are you obligated to wait until she gets married? A wedding is a wedding. She should have been happy that you have a second chance to be happy. But she is only being selfish, thinking about herself. I don't understand why women make a big fuss about things like this. You have your own life to live, and if you live it based on what people think you should do, then you will be a very unhappy person. At times, relatives will try to dictate on what you should do because they want you to work around them, but this will make you unhappy too. So if they don't want to share in your happiness, then you have your kids and your fiance to lean on. Tell your sister to get over herself. If she was truly in love and happy, she wouldn't have allow something like this to take it away.|`|Ekg4H6HQaa	I think your sister just wants the attention to herself. I would have to say, get married before her. It's a small wedding, no big fuss. If she makes it one, that's her problem, not yours. Maybe she wanted to get married before her because it somehow makes her feel better about herself. <br>  <br>  There are a lot of people who get married soon after they become engaged. I think the worst part of it all is that your own family, the people you love and would invite to your small wedding, are so against this. Do it the way you want to. It's not about how long you're engaged. That's just being stupid. There are worse things to get mad about, tell them to focus on those things.|`|M1KYxcvSaa	Your sister sounds really selfish.  She's so caught up in her own little world that she actually had to fake being happy for you? And then had the audacity to tell you that?  WOW!  <br>  <br>  Your wedding has nothing to do with her.  Yes, it would be rude to plan your wedding the same day as hers, but that's not what you're doing.  Tell her this way your little wedding will be over long before hers and she'll get the spotlight all to herself again.  Try not to roll your eyes when you say it.  Oooh, or if you want to have a little fun with it, suggest a double wedding!|`|NtSQcyHLaa	I don't think there's anything wrong with you getting married first. If she understands that your wedding is going to be small, especially in comparison to hers, then she really shouldn't be that upset. Just try to reason with her and make her realize that you're not doing it to upstage her in any way. In fact, you might even be able to convince her that you're doing it to get yours out of the way so that hers can be completely in the spot light. With yours over and out of the way, everyone can focus on hers, including you, who won't have your own stuff to worry about anymore. You know, sweeten the package a little. Haha.|`|bc0NTxNUaa	No, no, no; you aren't doing any wrong here. I don't mean any offense by this, but your sister sounds like a drama queen and an attention-seeker. As a sister, she should be happy for you just as you were happy for her. She should come to realize that she is planning a big, elaborate wedding that takes more time than a small wedding. It would really have nothing to do with the time of engagement. It's all about the amount of time it would take to prepare for it. You're not going to be 'stealing her thunder' if its a year before her's. She's just being selfish. Don't let her ruin your big day for you. She'll get over it and move on eventually (:|`|f4HsyUfQaa	Well it seems that your in a sticky situation. Darned if you do and darned if you don't. Personally, I would say go ahead and plan a small, but lovely wedding. Invite just the immediate family only, including your sister. It's a year before her wedding. I don't see the problem with it.|`|iDfRTLklaa	Go ahead and have your wedding.  A wedding is a celebration of two peoples loves not a way to be in the spotlight.  Your family will come around when they realise that you are not going to back down, and that this is about you and your fiancée and not you trying to steal the spot light from your little sister.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your wedding|`|3ag4Fu5Naa	No, you should have your small wedding. Your sister wont mind. She should be happy with whatever makes you happy. But if your that worried, why don't you ask her how she feels. Im sure she will be fine with it :)|`|e2bc9d6d80cd30940315e03dcd764fd3aa	She is not entitled to a year and a half of spotlight. Period.|`|BKbS9Ccjaa	no|`|EyhML4GPaa	im in the very same dilema. my sis is older however and we have never been married she also got engaged in nov and they were going to plan to wed in june however my little brothers deployment shes putting it off untill nov. my boyfriend proposed to me also . weve been dating ten months now but i accepted and due to reasons like that we have not told anyone about it. we plan to go with each one of our closest friends and get married with a simple wedding package. we will film it. but we will send out announcements when we get home. i just dont like dealing with the charades. i love my big sis but im pretty sure shes going to take me out of her wedding for this. but they dont want me to marry because my man isnt wealthy and thats not fair. and i dont want to put up with their crap. its my day my wedding my life and the man i love. thats all that matters. they will eventually get over it.|`|Fk6Axwm6aa	Well your little sister did set her wedding day before you, and it is kind taking the spot light away from her, and usually the older sister gets married before the younger one buy since you are were already married, you should just let her get married first.<br>  Or I do see why you don't want to wait a year and a half so you should talk to your sister about pushing the date forward. Or you can elope and have a ceremony a year and a half later.<br>  Hope this helps Congrats|`|dOix26N3aa	Ok - here's my personal opinion (stands on his soapbox...LOL)<br>  <br>  Apparently, your younger sister wants to keep all of the attention on her until her wedding is over.  From the sound of it, so does the rest of your family.  If it were me, I would try to speak to each of the family members individually & explain exactly what you want, just like you did here.  If they all still think it's "wrong", then you & your live-in boyfriend go ahead & get married yourselves.  If your family objects to that, too bad.  They had the chance to be witness to your union.  Why should you & he put your own happiness on hold for more than a year - especially when it has nothing at all to do with your sisters' wedding?  Nobody knows what can happen tomorrow, so I say grab the brass ring while you can and to heck with those that object.  Not only that, but you've had your first wedding so I don't blame you for not really wanting anything big - Kudos to you for that.<br>  <br>  Good luck - I hope this helps even a little. (gets off his soapbox).
BXNwjJy0aa	I THINK U TWO ARE FEELING WHAT I CALL Connectivity or chemistry this is rare go for it there is only one guy out there for u so try finding him!|`|wmtbNdO0aa	Maybe he does like you, ask him! <br>  <br>  Help me? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AssgEqRd3STooOIIpsAaDUfsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307153737AA2gSOo">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|yFdKtjQVaa	i don't get it, if he wasn't yer boyfriend than how can you break up? <br>  <br>  if you mean like she doesn't want you to go for him than just ignore her, <br>  she needs to let him go.  <br>  <br>  just be like oh wanna do hw together or something like that, friends do.  then be flirty when your alone with him and see if it goes well.  <br>  <br>  if your friend gets on yer back, tell her that you really like him and that you really respect her freindship but if she respected yours than she'd understand that a boy shouldn't get in the way of your relationship. LOL turn the tables on her.|`|pASaoHZSaa	Well, it's pretty obvious he's giving you all the right signals and hints, but you should really talk to your best friend. Girls can like guys on and off for years, but best friends stick with you through the thick and thin. Would you want to ruin a perfectly good friendship just because your hormones kicks in? No. If you're best friend is okay with you liking him, then go for it. Drop HIM hints, and see if he returns the favor. Don't worry about his facial expressions, some guys are really good at hiding them. It's what he DOES that matters, so take mental notes and good luck (: Hope I helped a little.|`|pYJ0I0cXaa	we are not there with you, so the person you need to ask is HIM, not us. He is the one you care about and it would be nearly impossible for us to tell you unless we could also get his side of the story.|`|vFI7wsJeaa	as much as you want to think its too good to be true... hes totally into you!|`|GoGaYHDyaa	Like OMG who cares?|`|4RGKzAyaaa	I know what you mean. I have this guy that always stares at me.. And i ask him y and he did. I know he does like you. and about your friend, if she is going to be alll mad cuz u like him and he likes you then she is not a relly friend. you need to do what you think is right. I bet he still likes you. you just have to found out and see i hope i helped a little..|`|NqNM1WObaa	it is very congusing to know when a guy likes u. dont focus if he likes u or not. it only matters whether u like him or not. if u really like him u should ask him to go to the mall on the weekend with u or hang out with u somtime. :)|`|rhvA4G4Paa	I think he likes you or is at least interested.<br>  <br>  As for your friend, I'd just tell her that you like him and for her to find someone else.|`|tMToRXIWaa	definatly more|`|FtD7KDfpaa	if you like him go for him and he's SOOO into you|`|652f86128ae64c87e38f223f6f1c934faa	u r his crush|`|83XVUo4Paa	he obviously like u okay here is how u can really tell ask him if he likes anyone but ask it as a friend n if he says y just be like i have nothing else to ask n then he will never no what to say n if he says yeah looks u n the eyes and smiles it probably a guarantee that its u but be prepared because he is gunna ask u if u like someone so say umm yeah n if he says who b like OH u tell me n if he says well u no her be like ha ha is it me n if he says yeah ur guud but if he is like um no just say OH gawsh n then he will b like OH she really liked me n then u will be to go and he might ask u out so be prepared for whatever comes your way

The chance that you are going to stay with him for another 2-3 years until you're both 18 is very unlikely.|`|bSUipR3uaa	he won't ever stop cheating on you. He knows he can get away with it and he will do it again. This is why girls are so stupid. You pick the guy that treats you like dog poop on his shoes, and you continue to take him back and think he is this great knight in shinny armor.

UYcdXYGvaa	I'm in the same situation as you, and I figured out the solution.<br>  <br>  If you are confident in saying I don't drink and still occasionally go to parties without drinking people won't care and respect that. In fact some girls find it attractive when men are assertive, confident and mature.<br>  <br>  In short, drinking isn't what makes you attractive, its your personality.|`|gXkiqyeaaa	No|`|dKxrbUQZaa	not all girls like the same thing, so some girls yes, some no.

And trust me, you don't want to be in love, I've been there.|`|mefxIQP9aa	Well, it depends on how you, yourself, think of what love really means?<br>  <br>  Does it mean to have the same things in common? <br>  Does it mean to admire their physical features such as their hair?<br>  Does it mean you would give up your life for them?<br>  <br>  Adults say that kids can't be in love because a lot of young kids say it so often but do not really know what it means. They say "I love you" one day and then "I hate you" the next day. They'll act childish and try to make each other jealous. It's silly really but that's what kids do. We've all done that but I can't agree with anyone if they say that's what love is made up of because I believe it's more than that.<br>  <br>  People who are in a serious relationship do not do that. They do not play around with each others feelings. When there is a problem, they talk it out. When one is in distress, the other one comes to their rescue. They'll most likely take a bullet for each other. They always support them. If the whole world is against one of them, the other will stand by their side.<br>  <br>  You see...I'm an adult and I have a more mature view of what love really stands for. I've been in and out of relationships and have come to understand what love should really mean.<br>  <br>  I can't give you the concrete definition of what love is but it is more than a physical connection and sometimes its more than an emotional connection.<br>  <br>  I've been dating my boyfriend for 3 years and I do love him. When I want to get away from the world, I go to him. He is my sanctuary. He is the reason why I am still sane. Not because he smells nice, or because he has nice features, or because he's tall, etc. There is more to him than his physical features. He's my drug. My addiction.

Very Unfortunate!|`|565df5fe4c276dc3f59d54d1b9259380aa	I wonder how you know that is what they are after. Do you assume that based on your physical appearance or do they do something to make you think that ( stare at your chest or fondle you). Do not mean to sound weird or offensive, but how do you actually know that? Men can like you for your personality, but it may be difficult sometimes. You can not change them. Just look past them. There is a man out there who does not do that.|`|ZZbbFCIFaa	I don't know why can't girls like guys for them and not their wallets.|`|KKjYBs1Haa	I find it hard to believe that you had soo many boyfriends that only liked you for your boobs.

But it's hard to imagine not getting to know you and like your personality after that first attraction, when he looked at your boobs.<br>  <br>  Are you insecure about your body?

jimYYyXuaa	you dont know how much parents care about you. my mom always does the same for me, she never lets me go hang with my friends and she's always paranoid about everything<br>  <br>  parents just love you a lot and they want the best for you. you have to prove to them that you are responsible (like you said) ex: clean up your own room, volunteer to sweep or vaccum (i know its hard!!!), study, do homework right when you get home, and give her a great big hug when she comes home from work (lol).<br>  <br>  ultimately all of these things are meant to be for you, not to impress your parents, but i think you already got that :]<br>  <br>  good luck!!!|`|bmoCpcdraa	perv.s hang out at malls to prey on young children , everybody knows that,dear.|`|qkuMPSczaa	you have to explain to her the she was a teenager once too and she wanted freedom also. She will realize that you are the same way as her and she should understand your situation. You could also do responsible things. What ever she asks you to do just do it. Then keep on doing those things without her asking you and she will see you are responsible.

Just make her see how good of a person you are, and she might end up falling in love with you.

Also, if she dont agree, then you may have to break up with her, since you do not want her to change your values.|`|yv3hBhbGaa	well im sorry to say that you might have to breakup with her. she needs to respect your dessision and not pressure you into something you dont want to do / dont beleive in|`|a4qzfDq2aa	im not sure :(|`|UebWhbD6aa	first try to let her understand u, if she doesn't u have no choice but to break up with her.|`|xG1CUaipaa	she's horny, its natural<br>  So are you, but you have religious reasons for not having sex<br>  I totally admire your willpower at sying no to sex<br>  <br>  But honestly.. all that God stuff is bullshit. Google Zeitgiest and watch the movie..<br>  <br>  <br>  "God" made every specie with charactaristics to fight off or ward off predators, he made them all horny so they would keep their species going. Humans are horny because its biological, to have offspring. If your going to do it, no matter what (even if she is on birth control and not cheating on you) NEVER do it without a condom!|`|dLssvySjaa	You need to sit her down and lay down the law, so to say. <br>  Just tell her that she needs to respect your decision to wait. As to her saying why not now, you have to make it clear: because I am against sex before marriage. Period. Tell her why not later? I realize you don't want to break up with her, but that may be the only way. I hope everything works!|`|sFqsTXvwaa	This made me laugh. Tell her take a cold shower and get over it. Imagine if the roles were reversed...a Christian girl wanting to wait until she was married, and her boyfriend pressuring her -- getting on top of her naked while she's sleep -- that's totally not cool.|`|qlJAC8kOaa	It's okay to turn down sex. Girls mature faster then boys. I look at it like this, It's your body and your decision. I respect your beliefs and she doesn't. You need to make a choice; sex or your beliefs.

Maybe--it you have not--after getting nice and turned on with kissing let her hand press you where you swell, maybe let her pull your zipper down (wear boxers--open easily in the front) and let her fingers explore gently (if she wants)....then if you both feel Ok about it, let her pull your penis out and let her see and stroke it, and later her lips might offer it a kiss, just as you might offer the nipples of her breasts a kiss.

If he has a different skin color than you that shouldn't change your relationship.|`|pQw80POJaa	No, it is not wrong to date outside your race. It is however challenging because there is still a lot of racism in this world. As long as you two love each other and promise to battle it together, it'll definitely be a successful relationship.<br>  <br>  When dealing with your life choices tell yourself this: This is MY life. I am living it to make MYSELF happy. The guys who disapproved of your life choices sounds like he is a hypocrite.

dK6YGyNyaa	I'd say go ahead and talk to him on AIM but be careful not to give out any personal information just in case there is anything dodgy going on (I know you think there isn't but it may well be someone pretending to be that guy, you never know). Just keep your wits about you and use your common sense, and don't meet up with him alone - if you do meet up with him, do it in a public place and suggest to him that you both take a friend; not only is this safer but it also creates an environment for easy, casual conversation, instead of an awkward first meeting. Be safe.|`|x9FienLUaa	If you want to get to know him give him your s/n and just be yourself - then see what happens.|`|pjggSVKKaa	ok you dont know him give him the aim or wat eva he wants just not an adress or a personal telephone number also if he was at this party ask around find out what hes like|`|n3pSWkg0aa	i think... go talk to him on aim :) i think he might like you|`|YV3Dh4lQaa	Give him your AIM and wait and see what he says!

Ask them to introduce you to some girls. If anything that should work wonders.

This won't settle in until about 11th grade, then you'll have more girls than you'll know what to do with.|`|qlJAC8kOaa	The answer to this question is simple. It seem you must like somebody you hang with. If you do, then ask that person out. Other then that what are you talking about?|`|feb0df556be60b6ae1592e3a13327aedaa	Be Paitent, most freshmen girls are hoping to be with older guys.. every girl wants a older guy, so it might not be your TURN< also stop being friends with girls YOU GET STUCK in the friend zone./|`|joP51azqaa	you're fine, high school isnt where you are going to find a girlfriend that lasts, im 20 and still looking, ahh! kids are crazy these days.|`|a4qzfDq2aa	yes|`|b4Ha48Avaa	I don't feel this way,<br>  but i am a freshman going out with a sophomore.<br>  so you may be right.<br>  <br>  lol.|`|14e9ef73980e3a2ab30467901f107e04aa	i think not dating in the group is a wise choice b/c it could cause a riff in the group and some ppl will want to side w/ one person if something bad happens w/ one of the friends in the group. however this happens all the time. freshman girls feel it would be better to date guys that are older b/c they think freshman guys are not mature enough 4 them and will not know how to date...however some older guys don`t know what they are doing either so basically the freshman girls are in the same situation if they were dating a freshman guy. lol but don`t worry about high school dating. it`s not all the good b/c eventually couples break up and when you graduate if your relationship is about to end you will feel like you missed out on being single. since your a freshman just have fun in high school! dating isn`t the best in high school...|`|6Rru2901aa	One thing that's good about dating a friend, better yet a friend who've been in relationships before is that you already know what to expect, there's no OMG, you' can be such a ***** sometimes, because you already know how faithful and stuff they've been with other guys and you also know they're attitudes toward some actions that would bother her so you could probably avoid the bitching at times ;)<br>  <br>  The bad thing is when you both have the same friends and what if you break up and it was your fault, what if they pick sides? (wish by the way is so foolish) It's good to keep this in mind. Seems like you don't really have anyone in your group who you really like so that may be positive.<br>  <br>  It is very important that you don't get into a relationship because of pair pressure or because others are doing it so you feel you have to do it too. I was the only girl in my friends group who didn't have a different boyfriend every 3 months or that didn't have a boyfriend for most of the time in high school. It helped me to focus more on school and be a little more liberal. I turned out to be graduate with honours and I mean it wasn't a bad ride either. Not saying that having apartner means you're going to do bad in school! Just make sure that whatever you do you do it cause u wanted to, not to fit into high school standards,<br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  <br>  Moe Cook.|`|FGYh0U2yaa	i know what you mean about the girls thing they usually go out with older guys which sucks when your a freshmen|`|LGCLmUTnaa	Yeah, I agree. My situation's a little different than yours though. At my school most the guys in my grade, once they want a girl, that's the only type of girl they want (and it's mostly the girls who drench their faces in makeup and are rich and stuff). I'm not that kind of girl, the only makeup I wear is mascara, and I don't live in those mansions they live in. so there's really no guys I can go out with either. I really wish I could just find a nice guy who will treat me really well and doesn't care if I forget to put makeup on or if my family has money and can see through those girls... but I can't. I wish I could but there's none that I know sadly ): Guess I'll have to just keep waiting and hope for the best..|`|BFRiseE8aa	I went out with sophomore girls when I was a freshmen but ay don't even trip because freshmen girls go after upper class men so they can be popular and by popular they will do anything.....so wait till your a junior they'll come to you....buh idk if this will work for you, like it worked for me? <br>  <br>  P.S the reason people go out with people from different schools because its less drama, and most of the time those people are lying their single.|`|Ix4wLPJ5aa	Yes.  and if you just are looking for any girl just find one your not friends with and get to know her then ask her out.  If theres a friend of yours that is what your talking about then talk to her how you feel.  She may feel the same way twards you.  There isn't anything wrong with friends going out.|`|ba05569876d16f9d7e6925ba05852f1caa	Freshman year is kinda wierd for a guy because like you said most of the girls go out with older guys . . . .don't worry about it though because next year you will be one of the older guys and keeping the girls away from the new freshman!|`|XKOrPGCyaa	I know what you mean, you should solo yourself out so your a loner...then all the girls will think your hot and mysterious....lol jk go to parties bro meet chicks there
