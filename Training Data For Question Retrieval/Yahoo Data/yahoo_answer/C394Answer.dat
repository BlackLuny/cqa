AA11248883	Hi, i live in Mandurah and i am a number 2 so i am thursday and sunday.(didn't see a Thursday and Saturday on the list lol.<br>  Anyway, some good news, i was having the same problem and i bought a two litre bottle of Aussie lawn food from Bunnings. It is in a white plastic bottle and it clicks onto your garden hose and you water it in by hand. It has done wonders for my lawn in just 2 days and it cost about 9 bucks.
AA10114008	My wife if the office manager for the water department in our town.  She ran across a similar problem a few months ago.  Sad to say what they found was a neighbor steeling water during the day to fill his new swimming pool.  The guy would wait until the home owner went to work.  He would then jump the fence, hook up the hose and start filling.  Min day he would turn it off and remove the hose.|`|bFOcQeDCaa	Maybe the  water rate has gone up.

After that, give it a whirl- just cook something covered that smells really good on it's own- lasagna maybe :) a frozen one takes 2 hours. or whatever you have a craving for.<br>  <br>  If it's an "elecrical" smell, I would probably call the number on the manual that came with the cooker and ask.

Or you could drag it with a truck to where either you could burn it or put it into water. That depends on where you live though, so other ideas may be to spray garlic and cinnomon around thier nest. They do not like either. <br>  <br>  My dad used to kill wasps near our home by placing a black plastic bag around thier nest at night, and putting a bit of gas in it. The fumes would kill the wasps. If it seems feasible, you might try this, just make sure the gas ends up some place it should. It doesn't take much if you can get a pretty airtight seal and keep it for a few hours.

Otherwise, it would be possible to take cuttings from them, which can be encouraged if they're supplemented with some peaty compost, around the base of your plants, and thus make many new plants.   Stem cuttings are also possible, but trickier, and could be rooted in a greenhouse, or indoors on somewhere like a windowsill - I cover the pots with plastic, which raises the humidity, preventing the cuttings from drying out, as well as encouraging roots to form more easily.  Use a hormone rooting powder, gel or liquid to aid this too.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.  Good luck!  Rob|`|98tUW1Y7aa	If you cannot divide your heather plants. Try heaping soil around it leaving just the tops showing. The stems should grow roots and you will be able to pull them apart and plant the small plants. You could try this with one plant. It is easier than trying to root cuttings if you have no experience with that. You can use peat moss mixed with soil to cover the plants. Cutting that have a root already, are called "Irishman's cuttings". They can be pulled off the parent plant and either potted up, or re planted.A good time to do this is in the spring.  Good luck.

While 20 Mule Team Borax? is extremely effective in controlling or eliminating ants, termites, weeds, lice, fleas, spiders and roaches, the Dial Corporation notes, “This product has not been tested nor received approval from the EPA for use as a 27 pesticide.” Even so if you mop or spray the floors, voids, sill boxes, tunnels, backs of furniture, appliances and other areas where you see insect pests with borax - you will be surprised on how great the material controls virtually all pests. It has been used for years to make cellulose insulation insect free and fire retardant.

a089948638ab8211b25976b1581f3ffeaa	Centipedes are usually considered household pests, though they are more of a nuisance than a threat, and eat unwelcome insects and other household pests, hence no need for an exterminator....however if you just feel disgusted and want to get rid of them, then it's up to you.|`|c5ec0014eaccadd1063404da7009e9a4aa	do they have legs and crawl?  yes, they are pests.  call if you want to, but check around the house first.|`|86ba1eb61b371fb85569ada93dcb3652aa	yes! check around your bathroom and see how many you have before calling in a exterminator.  Go to Home Dpot and ask them what to use and also make sure it is child and pet safe!  Good Luck|`|BjQZ95HOaa	It's quite useless if you call an exterminator because they'll come back after a bout 2 months.(Plus it's a waste of money) I think you'll just better be careful. They're really hard to kill by squishing, and it's dangerous to touch them, so I'll recommend those aerosol insect killers. Don't use repellent, cause it'll only make it thrash around in pain, and bite you if they get near.
3p2z9mMvaa	I think the shrub you are looking for is a loropetalum.  I have several in my yard.  They are gorgeous!  I have 4 small bushes and one that is a climber.  They are very hardy, generally inexpensive, and quite beautiful especially when flowering.  I included a link for more information about them.  Mine are all of the Burgundy variety. You can't go wrong by adding these beautiful bushes to your landscape!|`|Kvq480doaa	Yeah, sounds like you're looking for loropetalum.  Lots of different varieties available.  Ruby is a popular variety because it only grows about 4'x4'.  Majority of varieties tend to grow bigger (6'-12' tall).  Pink flowers in spring and fall here in NC.  Purple foliage, looses some leaves in the winter.  Not sure of one that is an actual climber, but does  wonderfully as an espaliered plant (grown vertically on wall or fence with support and pruning to keep it narrow).

Vl4ZLrf5aa	When I had my broker's license, I sold a number of foreclosure homes.<br>  <br>  The procedure takes quite a while ~ from the banks end, they have to go through the repossession process which is quite lengthy...I seem to recall in most cases it was nearly a year. There's a six month period in which the owner can "catch up" the payments, and then once it goes to the bank, there's a whole other list of things that must happen before it can go to market...<br>  <br>  There are directories in most cities that list repo's; some banks list them on line, others place ads in the paper. <br>  <br>  So, let's say you found a repo that interest you. There are two ways in which the house will be sold: it either is a straight listing (with a realtor ) or goes to auction. <br>  <br>  If it is a straight listing, you buy it for what the bank has listed it for ~ there is no negotiation. If it is for auction, then you make your best offer, wait around 6 weeks (more or less) and hope that no one offered more money.<br>  <br>  Either way, buying a repo house means you are buying it in as is condition. With some of the houses I sold, the buyer had to bring the house up to building code; with others, the bank brought it up to code. This is something you need to find out before making the offer.<br>  <br>  The as is thing is what always worried me ~ if the previous owners were in such bad financial shape they couldn't afford their payments, what kind of shape is the house? A repo sold down the street from me 10 years ago ~ the new owners found themselves with a collapsed sewer line, a lousy furnace and asbestos in the walls. Since they were buying the house "as is" the bank was under no obligation to repair those things.<br>  <br>  Some repos are a heck of a bargain and can be worth it, especially if you've done your homework and have had the house thoroughly inspected ~ others are only worth scraping. Either way, it's not a speedy process.|`|1aSU7ifSaa	MUST SEE GOVERNMENT FORECLOSURES!!!!<br>  Don't miss out on what many people are doing to save up to 80% off your new home.

ZaVtFHc1aa	Much like its mysterious origin, the blue rose means mystery. An appreciation for the enigmatic, the inexplicable is expressed by the blue rose. A tantalizing vision that cannot be totally pinned down, a mystery that cannot be fully unraveled is the blue rose. A person who receives the blue rose is the subject of much speculation and thought. A complex personality that does not allow easy interpretation is what the blue rose indicates.<br>  <br>  Another meaning of the blue rose is that it symbolizes the impossible, or the unattainable. Since the blue rose itself is a rarity in nature, it stands for something that is hardly within one's grasp, an object that seems too difficult to be achieved. Thus the blue rose is admired and revered as an unrealizable dream.<br>  <br>  The blue rose being in itself something very extraordinary expresses that very same feeling. "You are extraordinarily wonderful", the blue rose exclaims. A truly wonderful personality, almost chimera-like is what the blue rose says about the receiver. A flight of fancy, an irrepressible imagination is what the blue rose is all about.<br>  <br>  Blue and its deeper shade purple have for long symbolized mystery and ambiguity. Again, the fact that the blue rose is a flower that has been fabricated increases this sense of surrealism. The meaning of the blue rose in this sense is an appreciation for something that cannot be grasped in full measure.<br>  <br>  The lighter shade of the blue rose, which is almost akin to lilac, expresses the first flush of love. Enchantment, a feeling of being completely bowled over in the very first instance is another delightful meaning of the blue rose. Lavender and lilac have both been associated with romance since time immemorial.<br>  <br>  The blue rose is also used as a symbol of caution. It expresses a need to be discrete. Again, there is a whiff of secrecy and mystery as expressed by the blue color.
AA11867266	Get a few Bat houses and hang them high in a few trees that are around your home - Bats are great @ getting rid of bugs like flys and Mosquitos - plus they will adore the new living quarters.|`|AA12297049	First off, walk around your home on the exterior and look for areas where the bats are entering. Bats leave an oily black residue ring around the area they are entering. You will need to seal these areas up first.<br>  <br>  Then, make  calls to a reputable pest control company asking questions.  If the company does not handle bats, they can usually recommend a good company. Most of these companies are willing to give you ideas on how to seal the holes, and how to get rid of the bats in the home without charge. If you wish to have them get rid of bats inside the home, it could be moderately expensive. Good Luck!

lavd3UHmaa	I'm assuming your looking for a pleasant smell and not trying to get rid of odors like smoke etc.  There are a couple of things you could do:  1) spray your furnace filters with a lysol spray like ocean fresh etc.  2) put dryer sheets on the inside of your vent covers so when the air is pushed through it is pushing the 'bounce' sheet smell into the room.  3) Spray the filter of your vacuum so when you vacuum, the smell is pushed into the rooms.  4)***If your removing odors, like in a bathroom, I leave a bowl of coffee grounds or the beans in a bowl and put a couple of white dried flowers on top for decoration..the coffee sucks up bad air and smelly stuff really quickly!|`|72DBWVBOaa	air out the house by opening windows   and use the dehumidfyer   then freshen it up with air freshener|`|AA10685211	Assuming you do not smoke:    1.  Change the air filters in your Heating/Ac unit regularly  2.  Burning candles throw black soot and it clings to the walls and furniture.  Use a candle warmer instead, but don't forget to unplug it.  A candle warmer that heats from above is best (like a lamp - Melaleuca has one for $24.95), as some warmers crack the glass bottom of a jar candle when it gets too hot.  Soy based candles are the best.   3.  Wash your walls and have your carpets cleaned on a seasonal basis  4.  Use baking soda to deodorize your carpets  5.  Change the vacuum cleaner bag regularly  6.  Spray-type air and fabric fresheners are a respiratory irritant and your company may react to it.      Just keep a clean home and it will be pleasant for all.    Melaleuca makes a great deodorizer that is naturally derived from Melaleuca Oil (tea tree oil). It is called Sol-U-Mel. Used either full strength or mixed with water to the strength you desire in a spray bottle, is the most effective deodorizer I have learned of and personally experienced. It is a great 3-in-1 cleaner!    With children in the house, it is critical to use non caustic cleaners. See http://mysite.verizon.net/res8ksuo/envir... for more information on that.    I am a customer of Melaleuca. http://meleleuca.com I have detoxed my house and of late, with the Travolta tragedy, we have learned just how important that can be. When Kelli Preston talked about how she detoxed her house, she was referring to them switching to all Melaleuca products.    go to http://awuwebcast.com and log in using G-yourname-yourstate (ex.

They lent you a working machine, so give a working machine back to them.|`|AA12279485	Having decent ethics says if you borrow something you are responsible for whatever happens while you have it. If you cannot accept or afford that risk - then don't borrow, especially from friends.    You borrowed an aged but functioning machine, and that is what you need to return. (it sounds as though you were lucky it did not start an electrical fire!)    Since the original cannot be reasonably repaired, offer to find and purchase a usable machine as close to the model and age as you can find. EBay has lots of "vintage" models, you should not have a problem finding an older working Singer on there. If the owner would rather have the comparable amount of money one like the original is worth toward their own choice of replacing it with a newer one, that may be a great option for the both of you.    But bottom line, I DO see it as your responsibility to "make it right" and your gracious 50 euro idea may be what you need to do.....good luck!
AA10766729	The first question to be answered is:  Do you itemize on your taxes, or buy or use things (specialized clothing for example) that can be written off on your taxes?  If the answer's no, then that makes things a LOT easier.    Step 1:  Buy a filing cabinet.  2 drawers will suffice; one for financial, one for medical, household bills, etc.    Step 2:  Sort everything into the filing cabinet.  Make a file for EVERY separate billing company or statement.    Step 3:  (and this one is important!)  FILE REGULARLY!!  Put an "in box" on top of the filng cabinet and file once a week (if you can....but never less often than once a month).    Step 4:  Toss all the inconsequentials.  Grocery receipts, statements and bills that are over 7 years old, that newspaper clipping for the gardening tool you found fascinating 5 years ago, etc.    If you can keep a filing system in place and operational, you'll find yourself FAR less likely to be disorganized.|`|AA12186846	I think a file system like the others said would be great. For the second question- Use plastic cuff ties. Look each one over good and if you know you dont have a need for it wrap it up and put it in a box. A thrift store or pawn shop would gladly take these. There is also a freecycle in your area on yahoo groups. GL|`|kxfviWlgaa	I suggest buying an accordion file (if you don't know what it is, just ask for one at Staples or wherever) and stashing your bills in there.  Some of those files have alphabetical tabs, others have categories, others are blank - just go with whatever you think you are most likely to follow.    As for organizing your bill paying, it can be VERY simple, check out this article I wrote about that topic: http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...    Good luck!!|`|2f1956ae205e8fe9f4ddba400f3e5c2caa	Take the biggest bill, pay it off file it under it's titled category, do the same with the rest until you come to the last one.  Do this whenever your bills come in and always put them under their rightful heading/category (even if you are in a rush) in whatever filing system you arrive at.  Cables and wires need to be labelled, this will ensure that you don't put the wrong cable in the wrong socket, i use sellotape and a strip of white paper, mark on it clearly in black felt tip pen and fix it onto the cable/wire.
AA10685211	The answer to the static shock is to increase the humidity in the room/house. I put a large pot on the stive on low and that helps tremendously.      Most any dryer sheet is good.  You have to do the sniff test at the store to see what you like best.  Be sure not to use dryer sheets on baby clothes.  It ruins the fire retardant in them.    Otherwise, Static Guard spray works good on clothes.|`|bttrB0Rfaa	Fabreeze will make things smell nice  As far as I know, dry air causes static, so you need a humidifier or to keep a pot of water steaming on the stove to help with it.

Asthma problems resulting from chlorine exposure is most often associated with large indoor swimming pools. More often than not these pools use more chlorine than is needed resulting in chlorine gas (not a dangerous level for most but can cause asthma attacks) building up inside the structure OR these pools do not use enough chlorine resulting in a substantially high level of chloramines (most often the chlorine "smell" is actually chloramines and not the chlorine) which cause asthma attacks. If you have an outdoor pool and keep your chlorine at proper levels then your son should be fine. I have only heard bad things about baquacil and this is just another. I dont know much about EZ pool. Have you considered bromine? A bit more expensive but you wont have a "fish" smell and bromine is less "harsh" than chlorine.|`|j6NjJeIraa	I believe you are inquiring about an alternative to a chlorine pool, EZ Pool a non chlorine pool.  These ionic sytems want you to believe they make copper, silver and zinc ions and purify the water without chlorine.  Well this remains to be seen, I for one do not buy it and it sounds like another system to lighten your wallet.<br>  <br>  One system that you might want to look at is made by delozone.com.  Their system is an ozone generator see Eclipse.  This works with a chlorine dispenser that puts 1/2 the amount of chlorine in the water, 0.5 to 1.5ppm.  Now ozone is a known irritant to the lungs and in normal people can cause constriction and wheezing.  But del's Eclipse makes the oxone and injects it into the return water to the pool and it is gone before it comes out of the return line into the pool so exposure is very minimalized.  You have to run your equipment longer with ozone, and it uses more electricity, but that is a good trade off for reduced chlorine and peace of mind for you and your family.<br>  <br>  A properly maintained chlorine pool is the way to go.  Get a good test kit one that the maintenance guys use, check into Taylortechnologies.com who make a chlorine test kit that specifically tests for chloramines in the water.  This FAS-DPD kit is available by itself or as part of the great test kit that tests, pH, Total Alkalinity, Calcium Hardness and Cyanuric Acid.<br>  <br>  Alternatively get a good pool maintenance guy who can test for chloramines and maintain your pool.  Have him come twice a week when the water is 80* or above and you will have the basis for outstanding water maintenance.<br>  <br>  I do not think your son would be allergic to the chlorine but the combined chlorine or chloramines is a very well known and documented irritant.<br>  <br>  You're welcome!!
KsnCKoakaa	Add a tiny amount of dish soap to the pool.  A teaspoon or so ought to be plenty.  (Don't add enough to make bubbles.)<br>  <br>  It is mild enough not to cause damage to pool equipment. <br>  The soap creates a thin film over the surface of the water, making it unsavory for bugs.|`|6059b1abd93af145f0d446106fcd6da4aa	Well, it's a pool and unless its in a protected tent or indoors.

OWFbRWhpaa	I could be wrong but it sounds like algae. Whenever we first open our pool up for the year the pool is always covered in the same type of "brown film" on the walls and the bottom of the pool. Sounds like your pool just needs a good cleaning.<br>  <br>  What we do to clean the pool is brush and vacuum the walls of the pool. You also have to shock it and let the filter pump out all the unclean water. It usually took us about a week to get our pool ready before it was ready for us to dive in.<br>  <br>  I would head down to your local pool care and supply store and talk to the merchant and see what they have to say about it. They'll be able to hook you up with the proper cleaning supplies so you and your family can enjoy your pool this summer. <br>  <br>  Hope that helped!|`|KJjgTt1waa	Its probably setiment (dirt) and you have to vacuum it out or it can ruin your filter.|`|6059b1abd93af145f0d446106fcd6da4aa	It could be dirt or it could be algae.

J9KNeppbaa	sorry, but you need hooks ups for the water lines and hoses!|`|lLm5uIuDaa	Without hook ups you don't have access to water for the washer nor vents for the dryer.  I have never heard of portable washers.  You should look into moving where they have hook ups or like most apartments these days, supply the washer and dryer.|`|AA10561878	to answer your question .NO
gosxJiOZaa	Red is a very strong statement so you go with some softer neutrals like cream or beige. Of course if you were trying for something a little bolder you could use a deep charcoal gray. Red also works well with browns and golds all the warm side of the color spectrum.|`|33760582961e78d40e93fb803e04eef5aa	I would stick with complimenting "natural" colors.  Look for those colors that you might find in the forest, i.e., Forest Green, Spruce, Waterfall, etc.
gosxJiOZaa	You want to avoid oranges are they are after all a shade of brown. It really depends on the statement you want to make. I'd go for dark rather than light, as a pastel would clash with the rustic theme. Forest green gives you a natural feel. Navy blue is calming and complements brown. A deep purple or black adds sophistication. White is clean and airy. Red is energizing. Pick a mood then you'll know the right choice. |`|waYuAmhEaa	you have many options.....you could go with a burnt orange or even rustic red. It all really depends on your personal taste.|`|gCgxi5kvaa	What about burnt orange, it goes with the rustic look and it will brighten up the room.|`|AA11705978	what color walls and accent colors?|`|33760582961e78d40e93fb803e04eef5aa	It also depends on how light/dark you want the curtains, or if windows need to be insulated, etc.<br>  <br>  We have a bedroom that has antique mahogany furniture.  Because the furniture is dark and is very large, I used taupe draperies over mini-blinds. The drapes help to make the room appear larger and the mini-blinds help with sun issues, such as heat, cold and rotting of the curtain material.<br>  <br>  Have fun with your project!|`|t2tYfRnaaa	Cream, tan, rusty, red...|`|nOVSf06Raa	I will try to find something for you , you could go navy if you like , red, cinnamon, ginger, I don't know what style do you like so I will begin with this  one<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lorilevineinteriors.com/main/images/pugfr.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.lorilevineinteriors.com/main/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://furniturefromhome.com/images/store/17223-38-35-25-t445-sd/760x600/image.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://furniturefromhome.com/images/stor...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://scripps-content.communicationsmgr.com/pcsupload/165a393b-d2a1-4248-b37a-1744a4da1816_player.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://scripps-content.communicationsmgr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://www.designyourowndraperies.com/cm_files/store/product_fullsize/Rustic_Life_Sage.jpg&imgrefurl=http://www.designyourowndraperies.com/product_detail.cfm%3Fproduct_id%3D371&h=300&w=300&sz=20&hl=en&start=12&sig2=Jhz3ce4XGW_QVF9oCkSsfw&um=1&usg=__wN95bby1NBGecrSgMeql5cHR1c8=&tbnid=nGtFnuAZf3lHlM:&tbnh=116&tbnw=116&ei=ly72SIeGGJn6wwHjrrzNDg&prev=/images%3Fq%3Drustic%2Bdrapery%26um%3D1%26hl%3Den%26rlz%3D1B3GGIC_enCA271CA281%26sa%3DN" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=h...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lightsinthenorthernsky.com/rustic-decor-draperies-c-199.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lightsinthenorthernsky.com/ru...</a>|`|YpacXscKaa	Maybe a pretty forest green! :]

E5gaKzCsaa	I'd wait until next year, until you've had a stretch of good dry warm weather and the wood is quite dry. It's pressure treated wood so it really shouldn't be affected by weather over just one winter. There's some controversy over when you should stain PT wood. I had to check this out  this summer, and from what I was told at paint stores, it seems that pressure treated wood is best stained after it has sat for a while, or when you use special cleaners on it to prep it. Both those things have the effect of clearing the surface of some of the loose PT chemicals so stain or sealer soaks in better. The Behr people say pressure washing is a no-no, doesn't do the same thing at all for prepping a new deck as cleaning it.<br>  <br>  I used a stain/ sealer on a customer's deck this summer and was very impressed. Forget the name but it was from Behr, is water based, has nano-technology in it, coverage was very good. I was staining an old deck which had some areas bare and some still with old stain. We used about the same colour as the old stain and it looked very good with one coat. Two would have been better but the weather turned bad. Next day, when water from the sprinkler fell on the deck, it just beaded up.|`|1FEgkagJaa	It's best to it on a hot day when the moisture content is low give it a good coat of preservative and when the sun goes down the wood will pull it in,There are numerous produces out there buy the best one you can afford|`|c4999086fee89f42c2ecc09a87b3405faa	Your BF hit the nail on the head. The wood is still full of moisture and this will cause the wood not to take the stain.best to wait till mid spring and do the job. I did mine with a paint roller.|`|AA10561878	After about 3-4 weeks use Thompson weather seal on a clear day.|`|K9hVqE7Haa	get an expert|`|AA11477816	Depends where you live, here in South FL you can do it any season.<br>  <br>  Anyway, Do it any dry day before winter-cos you need the coating protection for winter. whenever the wood is dry and it's dry day (preferably hot day). If not rent couple ventilators (usually lass than $15.00 a day) and use it pre and after coating. Bottom line is you need to do it before winter.|`|v3xEtuLLaa	Let it go until spring.  The wood needs a chance to dry.  Pressure treated, unless you specify kiln-dried lumber, is usually installed with a moisture content of 20-25%.  Letting it sit through the winter, even though it will get rained or snowed on, will still dry it significantly.  After a week or so of dry weather in May of next year, it will be ready to go.  Stay away from Thompson's.  The primary ingredient is paraffin, which makes the water bead up nice.  However, it does nothing to preserve the wood.  Look for a quality product, such as Deckscapes from Sherwin-Williams.  It is available in a range of colors, and comes in either water based or oil based formulas.  Good luck with your new deck.
PQJyaFDXaa	Yes.  The same stores that you get normal blinds from will also sell these.
