DFT6tYepaa	I know too really good fantasy seires, both with an element of History in them.    1. Chronicles of Ancient - This is about a young boy who lived in ancient times. For example a bit like the Stone Age. He has to cope by himself after the death of his father, and finds out he has a special power. There are currently 5 books in this series.    Wolf Brother  Spirit Walker  Soul Eater  OutCast  Oath Breaker    2. Percy Jackson - This is about a boy who discovers he is the Son of a Greek God. It is full of historical information, he battles monsters from Greek Myths and is really interesting as well as a fun read. Currently there are four in the series.    The Lightning Thief  Sea of Monsters  Titan's Curse  Battle Of The Labyrinth.      Hope I helped!|`|rvaXSVjcaa	You can try reading Guy Gavriel Kay's books. Most of his work is historical fantasy and very well written.    Greg Keyes' series The Age of Unreason also very good, set in an alternate history at the time of Newton.    NB. great pic btw|`|79YQAbSRaa	The Shakespeare Stealer series by Gary Blackwood - young adult series.    Pillars of the Earth and World Without End by Ken Follett - weightier reading but very good.

'Cause I walk like I've got saddlebags  That are surgically attached.    Just like yeasty rising dough  expanding to twice its size,  all dimpled, white and jiggly:  Ugh! My thighs!    Would you rather see me slender,  with my legs so long and lithe  and a shapely turn of ankle?  Believe me, so would I!    Does their wide girth make you giggle?  You shouldn't laugh so hard,  'cause it looks like you are stowing  baggage in your own backyard.    I may try liposuction  or diet until I die.  I may do step aerobics,  but still, so fat, my thighs!    Are you humored by the friction  of the rubbing of my thighs?  Do you fear I'll start combusting  right before your very eyes?    Peeking out from the edge of cut-off shorts:  My thighs  Flaring up from calves that look like storks:  My thighs  I'm a beached whale, washed in by the tide.  Stuck in the mud, 'cause my rear end's too wide.    Leaving behind dreams of corduroy,  My thighs  Soft talcum powder - their only joy,  My thighs  These are the genes my ancestors gave:  stout trunks that take many hours to shave.

iNXqiDIYaa	Sir Leslie Stephen's eminence as an editor, critic, and biographer, and his connection to William Thackeray (he was the widower of Thackeray's eldest daughter), meant that his children were raised in an environment filled with the influences of Victorian literary society. Henry James, George Henry Lewes, Julia Margaret Cameron (an aunt of Julia Stephen), and James Russell Lowell, who was made Virginia's godfather, were among the visitors to the house. Julia Stephen was equally well connected. Descended from an attendant of Marie Antoinette, she came from a family of renowned beauties who left their mark on Victorian society as models for Pre-Raphaelite artists and early photographers. Supplementing these influences was the immense library at the Stephens' house, from which Virginia and Vanessa (unlike their brothers, who were formally educated) were taught the classics and English literature.

AA11142708	Anything that stands in direct relation to something else--must exist. Existence, then, takes in a lot of territory--material, emotional, psychological, analytical, and, at least for the person who believes, God. But, "nothing," exists only in the relationship of an absence of something, and is excluded, therefore, from existing independently. "Nothing" does not exist--it is because "nothing" is a mere place holder (like the concept zero) that whatever exists as nothing, does so as an absence. (I think it was Heidegger but I am not sure,--at any rate some very knowledgeable people have asked this question.) The above is simply my answer.|`|MxFdGpowaa	Because, nothing does not exist!

z15RhXfjaa	Yep I did this.    When I was 20 I was living with a guy who I was engaged to.    I was sooo depressed with the normalness of life, and the hum drum of everyday existence.    I wanted fun, glamor, foreign lands.    One day I heard about table dancing abroad. The accommodation was provided and all I had to do was get on a plane which was payed for also.    I did it!!! much to my families discust, I dumped the boring guy, and went off on an adventure. It was the best thing I ever did, I had 4 years of constant fun with all the girls I met out there who were also American and English and earnt loads of money.    I spent my days, shopping and going out for drinks with them.      If you search there are many options to go out and enjoy your life, maybe my route isnt something you would choose but there are loads of adventures in life to go on....|`|FoIxsunVaa	I'm a bad source of advice. When I started my "new life" I was on and off living on the street for four years.    I don't recommend it.|`|1TPGdaXJaa	Yes. But its hard to say I did it with "no money" - I had some money through student loans and a part-time job - but anyone has access to these.    I grew up with a bad crowd in a drug-infested midwestern town, and eventually came to a point in my life where I saw many of the people around me falling, and not moving forward toward any kind of life I wanted.    One day, out of the blue, I moved a couple of hours away on my own to pursue a 2 year college program that would lead to a stable job and a chance to leave my part of the country. I still kept in touch with some of my friends, but for the most part I removed myself from that lifestyle and those ways, and worked towards my own goals. I didn't have any money saved either, I just rented a room in an apartment, worked part time, and paid for school through student loans.     The hardest part for me was moving to a place on your own where you don't know a single person. In the beginning its easy to say that its too difficult and lonely, and very tempting to go back home. It was tough and very depressing at times to make this change, especially for me because growing up I was a very shy and introverted person. But it slowly got easier the longer I stayed, especially as I started to meet a few new people.     From there, I moved halfway across the country on my own again and took a job in the NYC area, which was a whole new and overwhelming challenge in itself. But again, I met new people, had a decent job, and bascially made a life for myeslf. Eventually I moved again to a completely new city for a job, and this time it was much easier. Part of the reward was the educational experience, but the bigger part was the life experience of making drastic changes. After moving to new places on my own, I slowly became aware that I had grown extremely confident in my own abilities, and realized I could go anywhere, on my own, make a life for myself and succeed, no doubt in my mind - anything is possible...    Like I said, the first few steps are the hardest, but don't be afraid to face anything on your own, because in the end thats all you've got!

0LgpcOBDaa	I too have the 18~200mm VR from Nikon. It is a worthy but sometimes slow lens. The 3.5~5.6 could be better, but.. You have the VR to help as well as the ability to bump the ISO up a notch or two if needed.    Noise, digital noise, is getting less and less these days so higher ISO's are more than able and fine pics taken.    A faster lens offers a couple nice advantages. The image is brighter in your view finder and you 'can' shoot better in lower light levels if you keep the lens wide open..! If you stop the lens down - any.. you have defeated the main purpose of a fast lens.    Fast lenses are only truly useful if used at the maximum open aperture they have, all the time, and for DOF control (depth of field). My 55mm f/1.2 is a killer lens when shooting wide open, but is just another lens when stopped down - any.. If I go f/5.6 or 8, it is now just another 55mm lens. Understand..?    Your VR lens offers more - wide - and more - tele - than the other and that alone, to me, makes more sense. You have more flexibility.     Another thing too, to be thinking about.. How many DX lenses do you want hanging around if and when you go to a full frame D-SLR..? If you keep your old camera, yes, you will want to keep a DX lens for it, but if you go to a D-700 or more, someday, the DX lenses won't work too well because of their coverage.    As far as "brilliant" shots go, it's you, the photographer, understanding light and all it's gazillion nuances during the exposure to assure the picture is actually - brilliant (as in a good crisp exposure). A fast bright lens does not automatically assure this.    Did weddings my self years ago (like almost 25 to 30) back in Michigan in the film daze.... Glad I'm not out there anymore.. haha    Good luck    Bob - Tucson|`|df33eaa9d9fa77a930c76a56de1aa68aaa	With a solid, tube legged tripod you'll get more reward out of the 18-200 mm lens.|`|Xrvs24R2aa	I hate to give you this answer but 'it depends'    What are you going to be shooting? if you plan on taking lots of nature shots, landscape shots. Anything you would want to zoom out for I would suggest the 18-200 (which by the way I have one)    if you are taking portraits, flowers, indoor shots etc you will need the smaller lens.    The aperture is also very important if not more important. If your taking pictures inside make sure your aperture is a low number, the lower the better.bright sunlight you can get away with higher apertures.|`|GOLGzmt8aa	keep the old one save for the new one you will get nothing for it|`|j5Apt8hWaa	Your shots coming out "brilliant" has to do with your skills as a photographer ... NOT the camera or lens.    If you are doing any shooting in your "urban" projects that are in low-light or using a flash is inappropriate.    I personally own both.  I use the 24-70 mm f/2.8 when shooting fashion and glamour.  The 18-200 mm VR is perfect when shooting for press agencies and other editorial assignments.  I also have the 70-200 mm f/2.8 (with the VR turned off) as an additional lens for shooting Fashion and indoor sports (like basketball, volleyball, gymnastics and the like).    As you can see, each lens type has a different purpose in you camera kit.    Just so you can make the best decision for your situation.    http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/notcamer...

31420ed41c716cbb02addca8d450fc2eaa	I would say that you would have to make up your mind.  but consider if the moving forces in history today are religious or artistic!    The Reformation, which was well underway when Luther nailed his Theses up, was actually accelerated by Humanism and, in particular, the works of Erasmus    I would say that you would have to equate the two things, not differentiate between them on impact|`|5wufIH1Haa	I would say the Renaissance because it was a mixture of the old and new world. The study of classical Greek/Roman works of art, philosophy, law, literature, and the like were coming back into popularity.  There was widespread educational reform, meaning those men who wanted to hold certain offices were also meant to hold certain educational standards (again with the studying the classics).      Humanism was introduced into the lives of many Europeans.  The would make arguments through logical reasoning and evidence, rather than relying merely upon precedent.     Art sees the likes of Michelangelo, Brunelleschi, Raphael, and others.  Their works are still studied today leaving a huge impact on society.      The scientific revolution cannot be forgotten with further studies made in astronomy, physics, biology, anatomy, etc.  Again this was all based on empirical evidence and math. Look at Galileo and Copernicus.

79YQAbSRaa	Assuming the book isn't one that I've heard about or already read and I'm just browsing through the bookstore, the cover art or jacket is the first thing to pull me in.  I'm not a fan of paperbacks (a vision thing) so I'll always look for the hardback.  The character's names...if they sound too wacky (for a modern tale) or something I couldn't ever figure out how to pronounce (for a fantasy or sci-fi) I usually put the book down with a chuckle.  I look at the summary on the back or on the inside jacket.  Last of all, I read the first page...if it pulls me in I usually buy it.  If I'm still interested, but not hooked, I'll write the title down to pick up at the library.    For something I already know I want to own, I look at how nice the binding is (I like leather lol).|`|B1GjfOUdaa	Sometimes after reading book reviews in the local paper or magazines.|`|b1294888a8e10ac6a8ff0614d97982ccaa	Recomendation usually.|`|WhUV9k6Jaa	I try to follow the paper trail.  If I enjoy a book I look into who the author's influences were.  I like Cormac McCarthy and I've read he was influenced by Dostoevsky and Melville.  I like Faulkner and found out he made a habit of reading Don Quixote annually.  In this way my interests branch out based on literary minds I've grown to trust and not just the reviews of the media.|`|cxip3nA8aa	Definitely the genre. I go for the epic fantasy and science fiction books with good cover artwork.|`|Ai9VR41Waa	My husband and I love to read and we often go to a library book sale in our area.  People donate books of all genres to the library and they receive their funding in this manner.  I usually go to the mystery section and I just start picking up books.  I will read the synopsis on the back of the book and look at the front cover as well.  If it sounds interesting to me I will purchase it.  The synopsis is something that should really grab me.  I do like certain authors but more often than not I will read a book just for the pleasure of reading and I don't care who wrote it.|`|w29tsXLUaa	When I finish the last book I either go to the library or if I am passing a Charity Shop then I look in there.

She is a good writer and you never see her books in the Charity Shops.|`|BpcAVgEeaa	I've often wondered the same thing. Personally, I only buy a book if I've already read it from the library and loved it and plan on re-reading it. Or, if the book looks good based on the summary on the back and I've heard good things about it. I'm very strict in my book buying :)|`|4bb8aefb2a2ea8d99c78d3fbc5220586aa	that is "such" a good question. i mostly go for the reviews. sometimes, i like the the genre or maybe the synopsis at the back, but mostly, its the reviews.|`|uth8Ztbdaa	Yahoo! Answers. Sometimes I see people ask questions about books on here and it sparks my interest. Then, I look it up on Google Books or Barnes and Noble.     I get a member discount from Barnes and Noble so I  usually buy from them. Hard to find books I get from Amazon.    I have an electic interest in books (magical realism, non-fiction, young adult, sci-fi, fantasy, fiction and the classics) so its hard for me to buy just based on genre.|`|de0e13b53b8247e94598d0825137ca7baa	A combination of the cover synopsis, any reviews I've read, stuff I know about the author, other books by the author, and the cover art.  I've read enough to know if I'll hate a book based on the back cover, but love can't be found that easily. :)  I usually will not give in to the temptation to buy unless I have read the book or one by the same author and liked it a lot.  This means I end up owning lots of books by relatively few authors, but it keeps me from wasting money on stuff that was marketed better than it was written.|`|35JIECGRaa	Sometimes I'll hear about a book ... but if I'm just browsing the store, I'll look at the covers, the title, and if those look interesting I read the back of the book.|`|1OjZoHlkaa	The Author  The Blurb  Recommendation  The excitement of new places to visit, new characters to meet, new adventures to go on.|`|8BG2tqTGaa	if it has an attractive cover with the picture of a character on it..  unique story lines  poems within the story  characters you can relate to or likeable characters  historical fiction|`|Y0ffbZKraa	Just the description on the back (or inside flaps).     I don't trust book reviews, even from my friends, because everyone has such different tastes.    And though a lot of people actually do, I don't pay any attention to the pictures on the cover. As they say, you can't judge a book by it's cover. And that is entirely true.|`|NVUngN45aa	lots of reasons but mostly because it helps me become more intelligent|`|SOt4ia4paa	The first thing I do is I go to the back of a book (normally I scan titles and then pick it up and go to the back) there is always an introduction to the book like  What will happen to Sarah when she has to encounter a ...... ...... .....

You know, maybe a kid that felt like she/he was destined to be something better or a popular kid that has all the sudden convinced everyone that she/he is crazy.

There are a few clues, particularly in genre fiction (science fiction/fantasy) that help me figure this out most times:    If, in fantasy, the cover looks like every other fantasy book (hero on a horse, with a couple of supporting characters, all in quasi-medieval dress, near a tavern), then I'm less likely to pick it up.    If, in science fiction, the cover is just the bulk of a hulking ship, and there's no hint that characters actually EXIST in the story (more common in "hard" science fiction), I'm less likely to pick it up.    If the font in fantasy is swirly/curlicued Olde English, or if in science fiction the book got its graphic design from Shatner's 'TekWar' novels, I am less likely to pick it up.    All those determine whether I even take the book off of the shelf. Back cover blurbs are another factor: If there's no hint of conflict or interesting story, it goes back on the shelf. Similarly, if I open the book to a random page (usually more true of the story than reading the first sentence) and the page contains a single paragraph of description, with no dialogue or action, it goes back on the shelf (exception for folks like Patricia McKillip, who can describe anything and make it interesting.)    Reviews are generally written by hacks, so I don't read them. I will pay more attention to a review blurb by an author I like: If McKillip, Carl Hiaasen, R.A. MacAvoy, George R.R. Martin, or Harlan Ellison likes the book, chances are I won't hate it. (On the other hand, if Mercedes Lackey has given it a glowing review...)    That's just a start, but it's a decent one!|`|862f8e3d565cf11bb982e86b1a4dcdefaa	Well, the first thing I see at the bookstore is the spine. So if the title/art doesn't pull me in, I won't look at it. But the most important thing is the story and the writing. I will read the back/inside cover to get a general feel for the story line. Then I will read the first page. If I don't like the writing style, or if I can immediately tell how the book is going to end, I won't buy it. I might get it from the library if I still want to read it, but I wouldn't waste my money.|`|fynzkVK4aa	I tend to be quite "loyal" to authors, and once I have read a book or two I have enjoyed by an author, I will generally make the effort to keep buying their new books, or even older ones I may not have come across before, until I get let down by a couple of "bad" books by someone, then I may move on..    I also, like a previous poster said, like to read authors which writers I like say they have been influenced by or whom they recommend.    I don't tend to pay a lot of attention to covers, but for authors I haven't heard of before, the genre and then the synopsis on the back of the book do play a big part in persuading me to buy a book, as does, if I am honest, the price of the book!  I am fairly likely to give a new author a try at around the 5 for a paperback copy of a book, but would be unlikely to spend 10 on a book by an author I was unfamiliar with.    As I am a fairly fast reader I also pay attention to the length of the book and the size of the typeface; if I find 2 books by authors I haven't heard of at a similar price which both interest me, I would always go for the one which looks longer as I get more "time for my money" out of it!|`|3d7413e991732aa7cbba574864c37217aa	For my personal pleasure reading: Biggest thing is personal recommendations from people whose taste I know overlaps with mine. Then there is "buzz" - generally people talking about, and writing in media about, how original or captivating a book is. If I'm at the bookstore I read a page or two of any book before I buy it, and I guess that helps with my decision too - when I buy a book, I feel excited about reading it and don't want to stop when I read it in the store.    Customer reviews on Amazon pretty much determine how I choose between two or several books when I'm looking for nonfiction or children's books. Their "search inside" feature does, too (seeing an excerpt of text or illustrations).|`|Hda1ic24aa	if your only friends are books|`|kC8i88d2aa	if it sounds good and has good reviews|`|1W5b0n07aa	definitely the genre 1st whether you like fiction, non-fiction, graphic novels, etc.    sometimes ill take a look at lists such as Time Mag's 100 best novels.    Once I narrow it down then I read reviews on amazon...that will give me a good idea|`|ohIqCgaUaa	Several reasons. Among them:    - The author : some authors I like so much I will buy the book. I am able to deal with buying a bad work from someone I think is a good writer.    - The subject if it is about computers and graphics.    - A good review from a friend or someone I know share a similar literary taste with me.    - The summary on the back. (it better give me a good idea of what the book is all about or I won't buy it)    Note:  I  am very suspicious when instead of the summary on the back  they put clippings of "reviews" celebrating one of the author's previous books. That tells me the author is not bad but the book I am examining probably sucks.    Unlike everyone here I do not read book reviews and I do not base my choice on them.     - And finally - The cover, the illustrations, typography and/or  and the printing and binding job. Being a graphic artist sometimes I buy books because of the way they look, regardless of the written content. Specially the old books.|`|tL3PxciGaa	the cover  and if its  something that i am interested in|`|43IUhcHkaa	I like to buy books because I know it is not a waste.

36ukxyZPaa	People DO remember Stalin.    Its just that Hitler and the Nazi regime is more in the public eye, so to speak.|`|hsyI1DxDaa	Two words: The Holocaust.    Pretty much one of the main and biggest reason why Hitler was remembered more.|`|V2c0dAtwaa	most definitely not AS evil, Stalin was "evil" but compared to Ye Old Adolf, he's an angel.     besides, in 1941(I am almost sure), it was Hitler who broke their (Stalin and His) non-aggression pact. (doesn't matter anyway)    Point being, everyone remembers Hitler cuz well..    1. He has done more global damage than Stalin + Pinochet combined.  2. Hitler's ideas still goes strong through Neonazism.|`|WvAwQmndaa	Hitler was in power for longer. He also was on the world stage a little more as an evil enemy to the allied powers.   Another reason is because do you remember the picture of Winston churchill, Stalin, And FDR at the Yalta conference? This might have given the world a different opinon of Stalin even though he is evil, he worked with the U.S. and Britain which might have softened that rep. a little.     I agree, though, stalin was as evil as hitler.|`|e49645bfb5de900c2415f519da297d20aa	Stalin was not evil. Most of the deaths attributed to him are deaths in WWII. Life expectancy increased by 1/3 during his term of office. Many people claim that Stalin was responsible for the famine that is alleged to have killed many in the Ukraine during the late 1920s/early 1930s. But what famine did occur was the result of rich Ukrainian kulaks destroying their crops and livestock in order to sabotage the Soviet government. Events were later greatly exaggerated by Ukranian Nazis/Nationalists (same thing, basically) in service to Goebbels' propaganda machine during WWII.|`|bTYIIrpbaa	Who is Stalin?|`|5wufIH1Haa	While Hitler did help commit the Holocaust. Stalin ALSO killed between 4-6 million Ukrainians in the early 1930's through collectivization of small farms to be run by the state. The export of grain to the west was used to increase the industrialization in the USSR to help the spread of communism.     Hitler was not the only one who killed millions of people. BUT Stalin covered up his atrocities. In the end the Ukraine was quarantined to keep the starving Ukrainians in without any access to food or a way to run away. This is why we hear more about Hitler, because the USSR classified many documents and their actions. Just look at Chernobyl.|`|doSdEtqYaa	Who told Stalin was not remembered. Its just Hittler committed even more bigger mistakes and he suicided .|`|ae69df0205dd6e6d96e6d67fdc47b203aa	Stalin is as hated by the population of the ussr & china to the same extent as Hitler is hated in the west.

Guess the results? 1) Prince Alexander Nevsky; 2) Pyotr Stolypin; 3) Josef Stalin. Seems Adolf has less supporters.|`|AA11327323	Hitler hated communists , along with his hatred of a lot of other groups .                       Russia actually won the war.   Churchill and the Americans disliked Stalin to the extent they were plotting together on how to rid the world of Communism altogether.  This of course would have resulted in the loss of many lives, both Russian and the other allies.                           Yes Stalin was more of a dictator than a comrade.     British history has nothing to be proud of has it?   America has very little history.  But between them they have inflicted a lot of damage to the world and it's people.  Hitler and Stalin are not the only contenders in the worlds .worse man competition by any means.|`|TzogAxLFaa	I don't think there's much point in drawing up a league table for evil dictators.  Hitler and stalin were both evil.  So where Idi Amin, Pol Pot, Bokassa, Papa Doc Duvalier and half a dozen others from the twentieth century.  Dies it really matter who was worst?    However; there's a terrible (I use that word in all its meanings) fascination about Hitler.  Whilst Stalin and the rest held on to power through fear; Hitler was undoubtedly loved.  Not by all, but by very many - and by some right to the end.  I do not know why this was so.  I would like to have the opportunity of going back in time and looking into his eyes to see what I can see.    This makes Hitler stand out.  Leading an evil regime is one thing; persuading an entire nation to be evil - that's a very frightening thought.  Can it happen again?|`|22tPNksKaa	Stalin was worse... far worse. There were things that sickened even Hitler. He never went to the camps. He knew, but what it took to rid Germany of it's racial enemies, it was to much for him to stomach.    But Stalin... he was a jolly bastard. He signed away MILLIONS of lives after WW 2 w/ just a pen stroke, then he handed it to Churchill as a souvenir. Churchill who also signed the murder document, wanted to burn it. He also joked about the mass rapes in Berlin during the Potsdam Conference, something Truman found appalling.    But the reason Stalin is overlooked is because it is illegal to praise Hitler for the good he actually did, whereas Stalin is glorified by the leaders of Russia!    Movies are made all the time about Hitler (Tom Cruise anyone? Nice accent, NOT!) But who makes movies showing Stalins crimes? Helloooo, Spielberg? Did you forget Stain killed over 100,000 Jews & planned on finishing what Hitler started? His WW 2 films suck. So did AI!    To Lomax, why was Hitler loved? Because he made promises to a people in need...and kept them. Even polls held 20 years after the war gave Hitler high ratings! Listen to his speeches & compare them to GW Bush. Hitler was actually more reasonable than US leaders. If the Holocaust DIDN'T happen, he'd be very popular today. Even I, of Jewish descent myself, respect him! I even havve some respect for Stalin. Yeah, he was an EVIL bastard, but he was a brilliant leader. Did Idi Amin, Pol Pot of Popa Doc turn their 3rd would nations into super powers? NO!    BTW, if it weren't for Hitler, Israel wouldn't exist. They'd still be wandering the Earth, w/ no protection against Anti-Semitism.

But the answer is, you are who you have always been . A wiser more mature version, but you none the less. I empathize that the whole experience can be depressing but it is an age old battle.

gOJ1A5Yoaa	Well I don't know for instruments as I'm a singer, but I use ABRSM (I'm currently Grade 5), through my teachers choice.     I think that generally ABRSM is regarded the 'better' board but Trinity has Grade 5 ABRSM pieces at Grade 4, for example, which means that generally it's easier. But I think in the end it's down to personal preference and teachers choice.     Both certificates will look good for you, and I suppose it's nice to stick with the same board, especially with the same instrument.     This is just my general opinion really but I hope this helps and Good Luck for your exam! :)
f9111e474fecefa1458da0f25b04e18faa	The utopia and its offshoot, the dystopia, are genres of literature that explore social and political structures. Utopian fiction is the creation of an ideal world, or utopia, as the setting for a novel. Dystopian fiction is the opposite: creation of a nightmare world, or dystopia, where utopian ideals have been subverted. Many novels combine both, often as a metaphor for the different directions humanity can take in its choices, ending up with one of two possible futures. Both utopias and dystopias are commonly found in science fiction and other speculative fiction genres.  Dystopias usually extrapolate elements of contemporary society and function as a warning against some modern trend, often the threat of oppressive regimes in one form or another.  Examples:        * Louisa May Alcott - "Transcendental Wild Oats" (1873)      * Isaac Asimov - Foundation and Earth in Part IV: Solaria (1986)      * Margaret Atwood - The Handmaid's Tale (1986) and Oryx and Crake (2003)      * Paul Auster - In the Country of Last Things (1987)      * J.G.

Said the Ticktockman" (1965)      * Ben Elton - Gridlock (1991), This Other Eden (1993), Blind Faith (2007)      * Isamu Fukui - Truancy (2008)      * William Gibson - Sprawl trilogy (1984-1988), Burning Chrome (1986), Bridge trilogy (1993-1999)      * Harry Harrison - Make Room!

Who were good at cavalry.|`|Ps2tufsoaa	The Mongols may not have had the most fearsome horsemen on a one-to-one basis, but they used their cavalry most effectively.  Besides great numbers, they had great discipline, stamina, and tactical superiority.  The Mongol  cavalry brought many extra horses on their campaigns, so that they would always have fresh mounts to ride into battle.  Each man was well-trained with the bow, which was made out of strong composite material and could shoot with great force.  The knew how to shoot when their horses' feet were all in the air at once, improving shot accuracy.  Battefield communication among the cavalry was advanced and effective, using flags to be seen at a distance. They could easily overcome slower infantry by riding around them and shooting them to peices, and even held their own against heavy western cavalry, as at the Battle of Legnica.  Ultimately, the proof is in the pudding:  They took over most of Eurasia with the strength of their cavalry.|`|b3456135bf4f0f591eca2857f5c90758aa	No they didn't , they had the most formidable horse archers , An innovation that nobody had an answer to at that time .

The only general that had out manoeuvred that type of army was Alexander the great .

lJ2XG0QMaa	Hey Im so excited you are taking Jazz dance! I used to do it waaay back in high school. I do line dance now (competitions and such) I highly recomend trying line dance especially if you have a background in jazz. Anywho, sorry I strayed off topic!  Any jazz shoe will work. There are many types. It all depends on what 'feels right' for you. In my experience- Slip in's are not so great because you canot control how snug it is on your foot. Split sole im not a fan of as depending on how you dance you can dance on the seams and ruin the shoe quickly. Full sole I find is the best right along with any dance sneaker type shoes.   'FREE1' and 'Jazzlite' from this site are great shoes:(see link)  Do not buy used as jazz shoes form to fit your foot snug, your feet will hurt if they are formed to fit another persons foot.    http://www.discountdance.com/spframe_set...|`|8S2icURfaa	Maybe Pidinis or split-sole jazz shoes|`|4bH6L9JSaa	jazz shoes obv! lol|`|edb8091d08e70995c94b8aaf70084a4eaa	gooogle jazz shoes because i never heard of that. I thought jazz consist of instruments so shoes should not matter. just be comfortable.|`|L76NCybXaa	I would start with a full sole shoe so you can build strength in your arch. Don't use a jazz sneaker. It is for more advanced students.  I wouldn't buy a used shoe. Here is a good shoe that would work for you. It is also on sale.  http://www.discountdance.com  You could buy it in a retail dance supply store, but it might be more expensive.  "Jazzlite" Jazz Shoe  S0402L by Bloch?    *note to "sent from..." FREE1 is a great jazz shoe, but not for a beginner. Your first recommendation for Jazzlite is a better shoe for someone just starting out.|`|cq4ng6QLaa	you can get the split sole jazz shoes or jazz sneakers.  i perfer jazz sneakers they are the best.|`|Nnqw6AU3aa	Split sole black leather jazz shoes.

SOt4ia4paa	Very impressive. I like you're descriptions and you're mystic, relaxing style. Very nice. Although there is one part I think should be edited. It's small.    *White foam forms where the waterfall fell  doesn't sound right.  try something like   *White foam forms where the waterfall meets the water below  or  *White foam forms where the waterfall descends.    Good luck you have some great talent there! Criticism is you're friend! ^^    From one writer to another    Moriko Kimitara|`|CCN2PneTaa	As it stands, taking into account your age, it's very impressive, but there's always room for improvement. Try expanding your vocabulary by using a thesaurus or inserting some more advanced imagery such as similes and metaphors. Also try to vary your sentence structure.|`|J05AvuuXaa	dude dont flatter yourself.  if you were 2 this would be good only because you know how to spell cascades. but the content is ridiculously juvenile. i'm sure your mommy and your teacher and your older male neighbor says your writing is terrific but don't go out an write a novel, this is pointless blabber. You need purpose and stronger emotions.|`|KTNqah9eaa	Yes i would agree it's good. My only suggestion is that maybe you're trying to cram too much into one paragraph. You walk all the way to a waterfall, have a swim and get out in a flash! :) I lost you when your fingers were in the puddle. Maybe you could try and spend more time imagining it and spread what you've written, in more detail, to at least three paragraphs.|`|hQ95u9OLaa	Abigail, to me 13 seems a young age to have written something so polished.

Who'da thought it?...|`|862f8e3d565cf11bb982e86b1a4dcdefaa	It's very good for 13, but you must work on "flow." Each sentence is approximately the same length, giving the paragraph a repetitive feel. Try to combine some of your smaller sentences, and make the piece flow better

bdnMQnVHaa	The Caribbean was on of the last regions to benefit from decolonization.  World War II have devastated Europe political, economically and socially.  That war essentially ended the European Age of Imperialism.  Many African and Asian countries asserted independence, often violently.  By the 1960s most European nations accepted decolonization.  Most Caribbean islands were granted limited or self government as first and then full independence, usually peacefully.

wsUXFeH2aa	What i do is that i use a reference of some sort if I'm drawing a person, just so that i can get the proportions right and all. Then i decide what type of drawing i want it to be (i.e. depressing, cheerful, peaceful, thought provoking...etc.) then i chose songs to match that. So, i sit listening to those songs with my pencil and paper in hand and ideas always come. You can also browse the internet for different ideas or positions or anything like that. I always use music as my inspiration, and it always helps. Hope it helps you too :).|`|q4OJ3G8Daa	You should look at paintings by surrealists.  They would often reproduce realistic objects without altering them much.  The imagination lay in the composition and juxtaposition of opposing images.  The play with free association and the relationships of ideas and connotations.

JyXfC3IGaa	In a nutshell: Most of Matisse's early works employ a dark palette and tend to be rather gloomy (oftentimes of landscapes.) After meeting with the painter, John Peter Russell, Matisse's style changed completely and later said that "...Russell explained color theory to me."    I would also suggest looking up a painting timeline and articulating your own ideas on the differences just by looking at them. There is a vast difference and it shouldn't be a difficulty for you, even if you' re not overly familiar with the works of Matisse.

QEEweJUaaa	Hitler's rise to power was based upon long-term factors - resentment in the German people, the weakness of the Weimar system - which he exploited through propaganda (paid for by his rich, Communist-fearing backers), the terror of his stormtroopers, and the brilliance of his speeches.           During the 'roaring twenties' Germans ignored this vicious little man with his programme of hatred.   But when the Great Depression ruined their lives, they voted for him in increasing numbers.

The "hung" German parliament at the time also gave him power beyond his mandate, as his party had the swing vote in many bigger issues, giving him the lever with which to negotiate terms and agreements from the parties with more power.  He used his leverage well and this too increased his power.

He kept gaining and gaining power until he was appointed the leader of the third reich, and then the darker side of him came out.

She changed the protestant faith a little by adding catholic details like priestly vestments. this was to try and converge the two faiths so that both would be allowed, but with the church of england as the head.|`|gnbBIRu6aa	Essentially she established a 'high church' i.e. one with much of the trappings and theology of the Catholic Church but separated from Rome.    As a compromise it was fairly successful she was as ruthless suppressing extremist Protestants as she was recalcitrant Catholics. Many more recent converts to Protestantism were unhappy with the more extreme forms it took, and felt more comfortable with what would become the Anglican Church. The extremist protestants would have been unhappy at any settlement that didnt recognise whatever one of the many sects they happened to be a member of, so as a compromise it was astute. The key point is that she was strong enough to impose a compromise.|`|R75tldc8aa	By allowing two religions; Catholicism and Protestantism?     I'm just guessing.

tGDOZrUTaa	It's a play, not a book. Abigail is probably the precursor to today's 'Mean Girls' cliche: Think of her as a 1600s Paris or Lindsay, who convinced other, weaker-willed girls to follow her due to peer pressure and wanting to go along with the group.    I think two of the most interesting characters are John Proctor and Judge Hathorne (the latter an ancestor of Nathaniel Hawthorne, who added the 'w' to his name to get rid of the stigma of his judicial forefather). I also really think Reverend Hale is an interesting character, who starts out an intelligent, defiant guy and who gets broken by the system at the end--shades of Kafka's Joseph K. there.    As far as the merits of the play itself, it has to be considered in context with McCarthyism. As a direct commentary on McCarthyism, it's effective, and pretty direct and gutsy for its day. As a play in modern day, it's entered the popular imagination so much that I honestly think it's hard to determine its merits, since so much has been written about it. It's definitely a well-written play, but I think the moral absolutism hasn't aged well.    Just my opinion, though!|`|BzMQejGxaa	Really good.

Paleolithic,mesolithic and neolithic periods. 600,000-700,000 years ago|`|WvAwQmndaa	The stone age was during prehistoric times when humans used stone for tool making. The term stone age is used to describe it because it was before any metals were used. It is believed that this age began around 2.5 million years ago.    Many artifacts have been left behind from this era. The petroglyphs are amazing drawings on cave walls that were left by these earliest humans.|`|vYAgIMLdaa	back in the 70's we got stoned all the time, man.|`|AA11981114	The stone age is a stage in technological development in which societies form tools from stone, rather than the copper, bronze, iron or steel more advanced societies would use.  In most cases, societies develop from stone age to copper, bronze and finally iron age toolmaking - if they survive long enough.  Stone Age technology has existed in various cultures from hundreds of thousands of years ago up to the current day.  Copper toolmaking is probably no more than 6000 years old, bronze 4500-5000 and iron less than 4000 years old.  Mesopotamia, Anatolia, Egypt and parts of Eastern Europe graduated from the Stone Age many years before other cultures.|`|QEEweJUaaa	The Stone Age is a broad prehistoric time period during which humans widely used stone for toolmaking.    Stone tools were made from a variety of different kinds of stone. For example, flint and chert were shaped (or chipped) for use as cutting tools and weapons, while basalt and sandstone were used for ground stone tools, such as quern-stones. Wood, bone, shell, antler and other materials were widely used, as well. During the most recent part of the period, sediments (like clay) were used to make pottery. A series of metal technology innovations characterize the later Chalcolithic (Copper Age), Bronze Age and Iron Age.       Obsidian projectile pointThe period encompasses the first widespread use of technology in human evolution and the spread of humanity from the savannas of East Africa to the rest of the world. It ends with the development of agriculture, the domestication of certain animals and the smelting of copper ore to produce metal. It is termed prehistoric, since humanity had not yet started writing -- the traditional start of history (i.e., recorded history).    The term "Stone Age" was used by archaeologists to designate this vast pre-metallurgic period whose stone tools survived far more widely than tools made from other (softer) materials. It is the first age in the three-age system. A division of the Stone Age into an older and younger part was first proposed by Jens Jacob Worsaae in 1859 through his work with Danish kitchen middens that began in 1851.[1] The subdivision into the Palaeolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic periods that still is in use today, was made by John Lubbock in his now classic 1865 book Pre-historic Times. These three periods are further subdivided. In reality, the succession of phases differs enormously from one region (and culture) to another, indeed, humanity continued to expand into new areas even during the metal ages. Therefore, it is better to speak of a Stone Age, instead of the Stone Age. As a description of people living today, the term stone age is controversial. The Association of Social Anthropologists discourages this use.|`|lVAe2SLXaa	To be exact, it was the ages before the use of metal objects.

3WItFAwlaa	Just like can't.  I know it seems wrong but it is true.
FY4cCjsOaa	I find both flawed, but the Kantian approach a bit better.    The problem with the "understanding of the negative consequences" is that the first thing any reasonable human being has to understand is that we DON'T see all the consequences. We tend to drift toward the notion that "ends justify the means" without recognizing that we don't actually control the ends, only our choice of means, and that choice, once made, exercises more control over us than vice versa.    I have seen very understandable efforts to control outcomes, all for the best of reasons, fail simply because the means chosen were underhanded and were perceived as underhanded, producing unexpected negative consequences.    There's also the extremely human tendency to simply push some negative consequences over one's personal horizon, so one doesn't have to take them into account. Proponents of the notion that there are "victimless crimes" which shouldn't be considered wrong often do this: they very often include the employment of prostitutes on their lists, and anyone who lives (as I do) in an area where forced-prostitution rings have been brought to light by local authorities must question that notion.    The problem I have with Kant's categorical imperative is not expressed in your description, with which I see no issue. My problem is with the "categorical" part: with treating human beings as a category. The famous short-cut summary is that we should always act in such a way that we could wish every person would choose that same course in the same situation.    Frankly, I regard human diversity as our most important characteristic, and therefore I view the expression of that diversity as a value. There are situations in which a person may legitimately choose to act differently from the way that person would desire others to act. (Try the end of Dickens's "A Tale of Two Cities" as an example.)    Obviously, there are other constraints involved here. One wouldn't want someone to justify murder, for example, on such grounds. But one can too easily make the categorical notion into an argument for conformity.|`|RYQOonOraa	there is only one view that is correct in my humble opinion, and that is the correct view, as taught by the buddha, as part of the eight fold path.|`|1243f4e8337cd349f01721fab2d47a02aa	Both.|`|3WItFAwlaa	Kant is correct.

7ONKVbbiaa	Womack is (among other things) one of the very earliest families in colonial Virginia. And like most families of that time/ place, came from England.   Names don't always "get changed" in the way people think. In the 1700s and 1800s, people were often illiterate.. and the clerk at the court house was thought to be more reliable in terms of "correct". Same for census takers. Many times, what really happens is that the original is misspelled and one branch (son, cousin, etc) winds up using the misspelling. Over time it becomes what is normal for that branch. It just happens.   Womack is still very much around, so technically, no.. IT did not get changed. If you trace your ancestors back, and find that the actual person is a son of Mr Womack, that is the answer for your lineage.   After years of research, most people find that spelling is just gravy, and does not matter so much as finding relationships.|`|mzRSO802aa	This is what I found:    Womac    Variant of English Womack.

QN5kO4Hgaa	The National Socialist German Workers Party appealed to the masses during a period of economic strife by stating that they were the only ones that could protect the country from its enemies and restore its greatness. During this period the Communist party was also influential as a national party.  The hard right National Socialist German Workers Party was the counter point to them.    In times of economic crisis charismatic leaders can use the situation to their advantage.  The National Socialist promised cultural renewal based on traditionalism, and it proposed military rearmament in opposition to the Treaty of Versailles.  In short they wanted a return to the good old days.  This was very persuasive to many germans during this period.    Once the National Socialists took power there was a suspicious fire that allowed them to take almost dictatorial control of the country.  On the night of 27 February 1933 the Reichstag building [parlament] was set on fire and a communist named Marinus van der Lubbe was found inside the building. He was arrested and charged with starting the blaze.  The government took immediate action and thousands of anarchists, socialists and communists throughout the Reich, imprisioned. The unnerved public worried that the fire had been a signal meant to initiate the communist revolution, and the Nazis found the event to be of immeasurable value in getting rid of potential insurgents. The event was quickly followed by the Reichstag Fire Decree, rescinding habeas corpus and other civil liberties.    The Enabling Act was passed in March 1933, with 444 votes, to the 94 of the remaining Social Democrats. The act gave the government (and thus effectively the Nazi Party) legislative powers and also authorized it to deviate from the provisions of the constitution for four years. In effect, Hitler had seized dictatorial powers.    I don't believe that the German people were conciously electing a dictatorship but the end result of choosing tranditionalism and safety over liberty was the of the election of the National Socialists to Reichstag which allowed the Enabling Act which created the dictatorship.
sQsl1r5Yaa	The Cotton Club was a nightclub located in Harlem in New York City.     While the club featured many of the greatest African-American entertainers of the era, such as Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway and Ethel Waters, it generally denied admission to blacks.  Nevertheless, it helped foster the growth of an artistic Renaissance in Harlem    A study of Harlem during this time period also reflects a broader spectrum of social and political change which occurred concurrently during this era. For the first time in history, the spotlight of popular interest was shone on African-Americans. The sources in this pathfinder suggest that as a result, Black Americans founded a Mecca and a forum from which to speak, Black Nationalism was born and the JAZZ Age flourished. Harlem was a place where music, art, literature and the struggle for racial identity converged. Exploring this phenomenal era, will assist readers in their understanding of the contributions and history of African-American people.    What occurred in Harlem during this time period, did much to effect radical change in the socio-cultural framework of the United States, as would the Civil Rights Movement and the Women's Liberation Movement in later decades. Harlem 1920-1930.

A 4 GB card will hold over 100 RAW+JPEG images ... usually plenty for a single shoot.    Also consider how long it will take to copy 16 GB in images at 480 Mbit/s.    The photo editors and art directors prefer I use 2 GB cards so they can be downloading and examining the shoot as it progresses on their 17 inch LCD's on their notebook computers.  I can continue shooting using additional cards.      The last fashion shoot I shot used 4 - 2 GB cards.  I was able to back up the whole shoot with two DVD's, two cards per DVD.    I would think that 16 GB cards might be better used on cameras like the Canon 1Ds, Mark III, where the image files are much larger and thus take up much more storage space.|`|2TLXfQKDaa	As long as your camera can use the SD yes.

WvAwQmndaa	well the early governmental policies were the foundation for the constitution. That lead to the country we know today. Even so, there are many who try to bend and change the constitution. Such as g.w. bush and the patriot act. that defies the constitution by allowing the government to spy on u.s citizens for no reason at all.

Despite its military might, sophistication, and wealth, the Aztec Empire came to a sudden end in the 16th century when Spanish conquistadors brought to the New World not only military forces but also a virulent and devastating disease: smallpox.    Until their mysterious disappearance about 1200, the militaristic Toltecs dominated much of Central America. Their fall coincided with the arrival of nomadic tribes from the north. One of these tribes, the Aztecs, drifted into the valley of central Mexico and became subject to whatever power achieved temporary hegemony. The Aztecs settled on the western side of Lake Texcoco, adapting themselves to the practice of constructing "floating gardens" of built-up silt. Here they established their capital, Tenochtitln, in the mid-14th century.    In the late 14th century, the Tepanecs dominated the valley and expanded their power across the mountains to the west to encompass an area of perhaps 20,000 square miles. This consolidation was accomplished under King Tezozomoc, but after his death in 1423, the various city-states he had dominated began rebelling. Three nearby powers joined together in an alliance to replace the Tepanecs, one being the Aztecs of Tenochtitln. Despite an occasional disagreement, the three worked fairly well together and dominated central Mexico for 90 years. They consolidated their hold over the former Tepanec domain and, in 1465, began to expand. The Aztecs became the dominant partner in the alliance, but the three tribes collectively spread the empire from the Atlantic to the Pacific and as far southward as the modern-day border between Mexico and Guatemala.    The Aztecs led the expansion in order to increase their trade routes while incorporating a larger tax base among the conquered peoples. They also fought for religious reasons. The Aztecs worshipped (among others) the god of the sun and war, Huitzilopochtli. The Aztec religion taught that history moved in cycles, the end of which came with the destruction of the sun. To keep the god healthy and shining, he required sacrifices to eat, so the Aztecs went conquering for sacrificial offerings. The pyramids that dominated the city of Tenochtitln were large altars on which prisoners of war were executed daily. On days of special celebration, several thousand would be sacrificed. This need for offerings drove the Aztecs to conquer but did not create loyal subjects.    Once their empire was consolidated, Tenochtitln was expanded and beautified. The city reached a population of perhaps 200,000, about one-fifth of the total Aztec population; the number of subject peoples might have taken the empire's population as high as 6 million. When Montezuma II came to power in 1502, the Aztec Empire was well established, and he was responsible for much of the lavish architecture and decoration in the capital city. Tenochtitln's sister-city Tlatelolco, which the Aztecs took control of in 1475, became the commercial center, containing the largest market in Central America and hosting perhaps as many as 60,000 people on market days.    The constant need for sacrificial victims created resentment among the subject peoples, and when the Spaniards arrived, they easily gained allies to assist them in their attacks on the Aztec Empire. In 1519, the Spanish conquistador Hernando Corts landed on the coast of Mexico with 550 men and 16 horses. He had heard of a powerful tribe known as the Aztecs who ruled a vast,rich empire located in a land far to the west of Cuba, his Caribbean base. Landing at modern Veracruz, Corts learned that the tribes subject to the Aztecs feared and resented their masters. Seeing Corts as a possible savior, they allied with the strange newcomers. Among the peoples of Central America was a belief in a great white god, Quetzalcoatl, who had visited the region in ages past and promised to return. Corts played on that belief, for his horses, iron armor, and firearms were otherworldly items to the natives.    Corts began his march into the interior in August 1519, gaining allies by reputation or by force. His major confrontation came with the Tlaxcalans, against whom he fought a number of battles throughout September. Spanish firepower and cavalry on open ground allowed Corts to slaughter large numbers of the natives. Tlaxcala surrendered to him in the middle of the month, realizing that the Spaniards could prove vital in overthrowing their rivals, the Aztecs. The Tlaxcalans warned Corts that the route by which Montezuma had invited him to travel, through the religious center of Cholula, was surely an ambush. When Montezuma learned that Corts had avoided the ambush, the emperor was convinced that only a god could have had foreknowledge of the plan. From that point, Montezuma seemed to have ceded the initiative to the Spanish. Corts and his men entered Tenochtitl|`|P02L0DTNaa	Steel, guns and germs..|`|d9f297647631bbfef114d9c411c59106aa	I wonder where all this small pox idea came from.

The spanish brought smallpox along with them, since it ran so rampant back in europe most people had built up an immunity or in lamence terms had gotten used to it, but the aztecs had no imunitty at all to smallpox so it killed many of the people there. 3. The spaniards, although winning a battle with the larger force didn't defeat them outright then, it was the mass death of smallpox and the additional arriving troops that came later that destroyed the aztec empire.|`|gnHZHjXvaa	Because all the other peoples in Mexico that had been subjugated by the Aztecs themselves hated their rulers, ie the Aztecs, and saw the strange and alien Spanish as liberators. They turned on their Aztec masters, and fought for the Spanish.  BTW, I believe it was 700 Spaniards, but that could've been Pizzarro in Peru. Can't remember. Gun powder and canon helped, not just because of the firepower but for the psychological impact it had on the natives. What also awed and terrified the Aztecs was the use of the horse as an instrument of transportation and warfare.  To many of the Aztecs, when they first saw a man on a horse, it was more like a man-horse-god(or demon). Last but not least, Old World diseases played a large part in the conquest by Europeans of the entire Western Hemisphere.

HpJB4lTqaa	There is no site that will publish your book, no matter what. You will have to have an agent - one that will believe in you enough to have you as their client... and it's important to know that absolutely NO cheap sites exist.     Unless you want to spend more than $2,000 to publish your own, and most companies aren't even THAT cheap, and that's only for about 100-200 copies of the printing! Most printing places even have royalties, and you don't even get to keep the rights!     The best thing to do would get a literary agent. They know all! Discuss everything with them and you will have a higher chance of getting through to the big dogs, which will maybe (if you're lucky) represent you. It's quite a long and exceedingly dreary process, and it's all pretty much based on people you know. Some companies even choose to remain reserved and unknown, because they only invite the BEST-of-the-best to your work published by them.     There is SO much to decide upon as far as type setting, type style, paper weight, LCCN, ISBN, barcode or none?, font used, etc., etc., but if you believe in yourself, you can get it done one way or another. I wish you good luck and hope you can throw a few points my way for this novella I just wrote! ;o)|`|XLMrrgcGaa	Publish America will do it for free, but I would not advice to go with them.  You, the author, is responsible for all the returned books in bookstores.  So, you are taking a risk having bookstores to carry it.  Otherwise, they are ok.

They are a POD (Print on Demand) publisher, which is not highly respected in the publishing world.  That is slowly changing, but there has never been a best selling POD, yet.  There are a few others pod publishers, but they have the same problems.  I would try to sell it to a legitimate publisher first.  There are plenty of small, but good publishers out there.

CSsht4T1aa	Well, in the interest of honesty, I've only read "Wicked" and "Son of a Witch" but I adored "Wicked." "Son of a Witch" was not quite my cup of tea. It seemed to be more social, political and religious commentary than an actual story. However, "Wicked" was touching, heartfelt and humerous. I loved it. For some reason I just couldn't get into the sequel. I don't think it was badly written, quite the contrary, but it wasn't really that entertaining for me.     I really can't wait to read "Confessions of an Ugly Stepsister" though. It looks hilarious!|`|e8b71105ce0186681d858502eb746fb2aa	I have to say that Wicked is my favorite. The plot is awesome!

2b0f1cad16f78b330bb0ca893a10471caa	It is sort of strange to hear of other people who have read George MacDonald! I really loved his books, especially "The Princess and the Goblin", "Lilith", and "At the Back of the North Wind". "Phantastes" was good too.  People nowadays shy away from his books because they are so blatantly religious. I mean, he inspired JRR Tolkien and CS Lewis, and now hardly anyone seems to know who he is. He wrote early fantasy, or perhaps late fairy-tale, if there is any differnece essentially. More people should return to the classics.|`|a40b287599e7375e562bfcbfed875770aa	Ooh, that's a tough one.  (I didn't know anyone else read George McDonald.)  At the Back of the North Wind is the classic, of course, but the Curdie/goblin ones are good too.  And of course there are his adult books, The Baronet's Song, The Shepard's Castle, etc.  The strong points of his books are the incredible layers of meaning that he weaves in,  (for example, great-great grandmother Irene in the goblin books symbolizes God,) but most modern readers don't catch them.  Which is really too bad.    I have to go back and read the books again.  I haven't read them for way too long.

a4e7a3e4fa62497e23c20d9b220d9f10aa	About Theology, I like it.    Ramayana was a book which was written by Valmiki.  In his writings he has said that Rama after defeating Ravana returned to Ayodhya for his coronation as he promised Bharatha. Then the coronation took place and that day the people of Ayodhya were so happy that they decorated their houses full of light. There was not a trace of darkness.   Now it has been celebrated as Deepavali or Diwali.    But according to the Veda Vyasa, who wrote Maha Bharatha, he indicates in his book that  The son of Lord Vishnu (Varaha Avatara) and  Bhu devi, Narakasura was born. As Lord Vishnu was in Varaha Avatara, his son too became ferocious and ugly. When Bhu devi told this to Lord Vishnu about his son, Lord Vishnu blessed him and gave him the mighty Narayanastra and said that only she would kill his son.  Later Narakasura became so dangerous that he conquered whole world. All the world was in darkness. Indhra and his companions appealed about this to Lord Krishna. Lord Krishna went to fight with him with SathyaBhama who was the avatar of Bhudevi. Later in the war Krishna was hurt and made unconcious. Now SathyaBhama had to fight against Narakasura. She fought bravely and killed him.     Thus the world was freed from Narakasura and the world was free from darkness. Thus Krishna said to celbrate this occasion as the festival of light. This is the Deepavali we celebrate|`|vY97mKIfaa	after the death of rama krishna was born.after krishna killed narasur we celebrate diwali.in rama's time diwali was not there at all.|`|aOoGqk2Xaa	not in srilanka or ayodhya its in my cockk  hahaahaha

She did say (on her website) that Neville would probably find Luna a little too alarming.  Which is kinda sad, imo, because they would make an interesting couple.
AA10015648	Slightly wrong spelling :)    It's an improbable contrivance in a story characterized by a sudden unexpected solution to a seemingly intractable problem.     Like... "There's absolutely no way out of the cave and the robbers are about to kill us! The first robber suddenly sneezes and keels over, dead from a virus that came out of nowhere. The second robber sneezes and dies, and we're all safe! yay!"    In that case, the virus would be the Deus ex machina.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deus_ex_mac...    There you go!    Good luck!!|`|8ohnecaoaa	Deus ex Machina    I guess it literally means "God from the Machine". It was like a plot fix-all for Greek plays and tragedies to resolve absolutely hopeless situations in the final scenes of the play. Euripides (please check spelling) used this the most in a number of his plays. The solution or resolution is usually unexpected and improbable (in real life).     Sometimes, the meaning was literal: A machine (usually a crane or a chariot) with a god in it would come down from the "sky" or over the audience members onto the stage and resolve the central character's (protagonist's) problems or save the heroine from certain death.    In Medea, after she kills her (and Jason's) children, she appears on a chariot of the god of the sun (Helios) and further punishes Jason by enjoying his pain and her act of revenge/rage. After which, she rides the chariot to Athens, taking the bodies of her children with her.    Modern examples are a little harder to come by because many modern writers see the use of this device as a "cop out".  |`|bcRmkuj9aa	With regard to Greek theatre, it translates roughly to mean "god of the machine".  Currently, it's a phrase that refers to any contrived (forced) plot device that resolves a conflict, but not necessarily in a way that makes sense with the plot.

2f5004aaadf7a01e4b37d68d83883b80aa	He thinks life is so routine. Every day is like the last, and the days are only remembered as yesterday and tomorrow. I think he said something like that (I read it over the summer). Time doesn't exist. I think in the end, nothing matters. Even when his mom died, he went back to work, and did the same thing he did when she was alive.    Here's some quotes:    I hadnt understood how days could be both long a short at the same time: long to live trough, maybe, but so drawn out that they ended up flowing into one another. They lost their names. Only the words yesterday and tomorrow still had any meaning for me (Camus 80).    I saw them more clearly than I had ever seen anyone, and not one detail of their faces or their clothes escaped me. But I couldnt hear them, and it was hard for me to believe they really existed (Camus 9).     I wasnt really listening anymore or I think I dozed off for a while (Camus 5, 9.)    It occurred to me that anyway one more Sunday was over, that Maman was buried now, that I was going back to work, and that, really, nothing had changed (Camus 24).      I'm doing a paper using the Stranger...if you could email me the citation of the book that would be great (do you have the book with a blue cover?)...I don't have the book on me. like-Camus, Albert.

The Stranger - Albert Camus    I have found  summaries for you to look at, via the links below.     http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/stranger/    http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...    http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...    http://www.gradesaver.com/classicnotes/t...    http://litsum.com/stranger/    These links will give you a summary of the book, character analysis, plot and much more, so that you will be able to answer literary questions. A short extract is included as an example of what you can expect from the summary.    Meursault:     The narrator and main character of the narrative, he is the driving force behind Camus' examination of the Absurd. He, like the author, does not believe in God and comes to the realization that one must struggle against and with the Absurd in order to create meaning in a meaningless world. He leads a highly indifferent life through much of the book, reveling in the physical impulses which made him happy such as swimming and sex and smoking. The second half of the book turns the man who does not judge into the judged as the reader watches him indicted for the crime of not giving into society's code of morals or sense of fate and the divine. The ridiculousness of the trial and his reaction to it allows him to finally transcend its symbolic imprisonment and free himself for a life beyond what society could offer him.    http://www.gradesaver.com/classicnotes/t...    Good luck.    Kevin, Liverpool, England.

Sculos antes do nascimento de Cristo, foram escritos os primeiros 39 destes livros  na maior parte na lngua hebraica  por judeus ou israelitas fiis. Esta parte  freqentemente chamada de Antigo (ou Velho) Testamento. Os ltimos 27 livros foram escritos em grego, por crist?os, e s?o amplamente conhecidos como Novo Testamento. Segundo a evidncia interna e as mais antigas tradi??es, estes 66 livros foram escritos durante um perodo de cerca de 1.600 anos, come?ando no tempo em que o Egito era uma potncia dominante e terminando quando Roma era senhora do mundo,a Bblia foi escrita por cerca de quarenta homens, durante um perodo de uns dezesseis sculos. Estes homens eram imperfeitos, sujeitos a fraquezas e erros. Como homens, n?o diferiam em nada das outras pessoas. Um deles, Paulo, disse a homens que encaravam erroneamente a ele e seu companheiro missionrio Barnab como deuses: Ns tambm somos humanos, tendo os mesmos padecimentos que vs. (Atos 14:15) Do ponto de vista humano, muitos dos escritores bblicos n?o eram homens de grande erudi??o e capacidade. Entre eles havia homens muito comuns, homens com ocupa??es tais como pastores e pescadores, s isso por si constitui se em uma prova de que algum estava orquestrando a escrita, pois seu eixo, (tema central) traz uma incrvel coerncia do inicio ao fim,  Ademais, toda coisa viva,e tambm as inanimadas, lhe concedem direitos autorais, s por existirem.|`|q5Ykc62daa	Vc t de brincadeira?  Se  n?o estiver vou tentar responder.  O autor da bblia n?o foi um homem, mas o Homem. Deus  o autor, Ele simplismente capacitou o ser humano na escrita. Se vc ler pelo menos trs linhas por dia 9fa?a esta experincia), garanto que em um ms vc ter a certeza de que homem nenhum na face da terra teria a capacidade de ter tal racocinio. A bblia  um livro completa, nela est a resposta para todas as perguntas do ser humano ( da de10 no yahoo).  A bblia n?o  um livro, mas um conjunto de livros.   Ao todo s?o 66 livros, estes livros est?o divididos no velho e novo testamento, isto : antes e depois de Cristo.  Alguns homens que foram usados na escrita da bblia foram: Moses, Salom?o, Davi, Neemia, Paulo (escreveu grande parte do novo testamento) e outros. Respondendo a sua pergunta quanto aos direitos autorais, digo que estes homens nada receberam em moeda, pois sabiam que se n?o fizessem o que Deus mandou, teriam um pre?o a pagar (a m?o de Deus pesa).  A bblia foi escrita pelos judeus, porm  em um determinado perodo da histria, depois de Cristo o clero acrescentou sem permiss?o alguns livros que n?o foram revelados por Deus, por isso hoje h uma diferen?a entre a bblia catlica e a bblia dos evanglicos. A bblia tambm passou por vrias tradu??es, aqui no Brasil a mais conhecida  a de Jo?o Almeida, acredito que ele tenha recebido algo em dinheiro pela TRADU??O, j que o original est escrito em : hebraico, aramaico e grego.  Existem alguns sites que vc pode se informar melhor.   Que Papai do cu te aben??e.|`|YW4qfPGCaa	A Bblia foi escrita por vrios autores.

o9xPFT1Maa	I would say there are many variants of mind-body dualism in the history of Western philosophy.  I'm sure Edmund Husserl subscribed to some sort of mind-body dualism...but some would debate me on that.  One of my professors at UC Riverside thought that Husserl was a metaphysical idealist, so everything that exists ultimately has an Ideal nature.  I'm convinced Henri Bergson was a dualist as well, at least at the time of writing Matter and Memory (great book on the subject, by the way.  He convinced me memories are not stored in the brain).  Does it help you to know I'm a dualist and continue to find great arguments and evidence for believing it!  The hardest part is overcoming the problem of interaction.  We should not think of minds having any spatial properties, so they are not like poltergeists (I'm not saying poltergeists exist).  It's better to think of the mind as an energy that does not have to traverse space to have its effects.  Naturalism must reconcile the fact that the brain is a part of the image of the world (see Matter and Memory) generated by the brain.  A very difficult undertaking!|`|hcO4YsVHaa	The Dvaita or "dualist" school of Hindu Vedanta philosophy originated in 13th-century CE South India with Sri Madhvacarya (Madhva)    A preeminent scholar, classicist and a first-rate analytic and synthetic thinker, Zhu Xi (Chu Hsi) created the supreme synthesis of Song-Ming dynasty (960-1628 CE) Neo-Confucianism. Moreover, by selecting the essential classical Confucian texts--the Analects (Lunyu) of Confucius, the Book of Mencius (Mengzi, the Great Learning (Daxue) and the Doctrine of the Mean (Zhongyong)then editing and compiling them, with commentary, as the Four Books (Sishu). In doing so, Zhu redefined the Confucian tradition and outlook. He restored its original focus on moral cultivation and realization from the more bureaucratic stance of Confucians of the preceding Han and Tang dynasty (206 BCE-905 CE) who concentrated on the Five Classics (Wujing) of classical antiquity. The Four Books became required reading for the imperial examination system from the Yuan dynasty (1280-1341) until the system was abolished near the end of the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) in 1908. In his philosophical work, Zhu fused the concepts of the principal Northern Song (960-1126 CE) thinkers, Shao Yong (1011-77), Zhou Dunyi (1017-73), Zhang Zai (Chang Tsai, 1020-77) and the brothers Cheng Yi (1033-1107) and Cheng Hao (1032-85) into a rich, grand synthesis. Zhu Xi's thought has been the starting point for intellectual discourse and the focus of disputation for the last 800 years. His influence spread to Korea and Japan, which adopted Confucianism and the imperial examination system and were enamored of Zhu's intellectual achievements. To study traditional Chinese philosophy, especially Confucian thought, one must engage the ideas and works of Zhu Xi.    Thus panpsychism can apply, in principle, to virtually any conventional theory of mind. There could exist, for example, a panpsychist substance dualism in which some Supreme Being grants a soul/mind to all things. There could be a panpsychist functionalism that interprets the functional role of every object as mind, even if such a role is only to gravitate, to resist pressure, and so forth. ~ j Searle

Here is a summary of twilight and then u have to read new moon afterward!(after u read twilight i mean)  this is my summary:    Bella Swan has bid her farewell to the sun and now is living with her father in Forks, Washington, a place of cold rainy days. She dreads the rain, the snow and the cold icy days. Everyone knows her at school and she is top gossip because her dad is the chief of the police. She makes friends easily and one day at lunch she sees a group of five shockingly beautiful pale students. They all look different, but the same. They look like the kind of people you saw in a scene from a movie or new hot magazine. The Cullens. All adopted. Everyone avoided them, and Bella had no idea why, they just didn't seem to fit in. One boy with bronze colored hair, one of the most dazing of the five suddenly takes a harsh disliking to Bella and she doesn't understand why. He doesn't even know her. Then one day, he is nice and polite like he didnt remember he hated her. He saves her life too. but it all happened so fast and she gets suspicious. He did so many impossible things when he saved her from getting run over by that van. Sh demanded explianations but they weren't given to her and they both went back to silence between them. One day Bella goes with her friends Jessica and Angela to help them pick out their outfits for the dance down in Port Angelos. Bella wasnt going because her clumsiness would just humiliate her. Down if Port Angelos she runs into some strangers that arent vey friendly on her way back from a no good book store. Suddenly Edward comes to the rescue and takes her to dinner. Her mind traced back to the conversation she had had with a boy named Jacob when she went to the beach. A vampire. that's what Edward was. Impossible but true. Their conversation was tentative, as Edward reveals the truth. Surprisingly it didn't matter to Bella, because she was in love with him, and vice versa. Edward takes her to places she would have never seen before and tells her that sleeping in coffins, is a myth, sunlight hurts them is a myth except it can hurt other people so they can never go into sunlight, and all that stuff you hear is a myth. But they do not eat and they do need blood though. the good vampires just hunt animals not human blood but when they see human blood they thirst for it. One day when Edward brings Bella to his house to meet the rest of his vampire family they start playing baseball and Bella will never be able to sit through a major league baseball game again. They have more speed than any car almost so they can run so fast! Some of them have powers. Edward has the power to read minds of people within 5 miles except he can not read Bella for some reason, Alice has the power to see the future but only after that person has made up their mind to do so, and jasper has the power to mess with peoples feelings, like make them feel better and that stuff. Alice predicted visitors and they turned up during the baseball game. Vampires. So many things happen and Bella gets put through a lot and you will have to see what happens to Bella once you read the book!|`|IWPMFZt0aa	Private by Kate Brian|`|AA11485027	Anything By Lurlene Mcdaniel is good but sad  Homecoming By: Cynthia Voigt is real good|`|21d1e270376beef1c4eaa5a12b66fa68aa	The Da Vinci code is a really good book if you like mystery  if you like sports, then theres The Perfect Shot (which is also a mystery book)  and...well...thats it|`|9k9V8Yaoaa	if u want good books just go through the following website|`|qweAeHQBaa	The Looking Glass Wars.

h5G43iUuaa	If you are in the NY or LA areas, whether you actually have an advantage with regard to choosing an agent is debatable. On one hand you have a lot of agents to choose from. On the other hand, you have an enormous amount of competition. You also have to watch out for (wherever you live) for so-called agents that are really primarily out to get your money without giving you your fair share of service in return.    Reliable places to look for agents:    Ross Reports: You can pick up a copy at the majority of news stands in NYC.    Go to www.rossreports.com and check them out as well.    Backstage.com has an agents' listing.    New York Agencies: A publication that comes out every two months or so and that not only has a complete listing of agencies in NY, but it also tells what kind of talent those agencies are looking for in that particular moment. The only place I know of to get that publication is Drama Book Shop in NY on 40th Street.    Association Of Talent Agents: http://www.agentassociation.com/  Will give you agents that are registered with them. It is an organization that looks after the interests of talent agents and that provides a series of benefits for agents. (A great place to learn the issue that agents are concerned with.)    Lastly, let me go into the meat of addressing your question.  You should also know that an agent that might be right for someone else and that same agent might not be right for you. There are agents that specialize in different areas, like a lot of smaller agencies do.    I ran into an agent in NY who specializes in Italo-American actors, because she booked a lot of people for the Sopranos and a lot of roles for those kinds of actors.  Another agent I know of specializes in Hispanic and African-American actors.    Some agencies will represent only union talent, others represent anyone. Some might specialize in theatre, film, television, commercials, voice-over or other areas.    And while many agencies do cater to a wide variety of talent that covers a wide variety of categories and ethnicities, you might also find that you work better with one agent more so than with another. I say this to tell you that you should not think that it will necessarily be the case that you find an agent and you work well together with her/him.    For example, you might get sent out on a lot of auditions and there is the possibility that you will not. A few years ago, I was working with two agents in NY. One sent me out on the average of about 12 auditions per week. The other sent me out maybe once per week.    There is so much more to know about agencies. So much.    If you go to this page on my website for new and aspiring actors, you will find a list of 23 links that cover just about any facet of starting an acting career including information about how to get an agent:  http://www.actingcareerstartup.com/teen_... .    Good luck!    Tony

Ent?o, podemos afirmar que, assim como para   empreendermos algo grandioso, devemos primeiro elaborar  um projeto, assim tambm, para que recebamos algo que   queremos muito para nossa vida, seja espiritual,   sentimental, para nossa sade ou at mesmo financeiro,   precisamos planejar e, com muita f em Deus, Ele que tudo  pode e tudo ver, esperarmos confiantes.

Quando realmente desejamos algo por que precisamos, e n?o por que queremos, sendo de carter puro, creio que sim, tudo se move ao nosso favor, mas essencialmente, quando realmente  preciso. Se alguma oportunidade n?o  fisgada por nossas iscas, tenha certeza que ela n?o ficar vaga.    De alguma forma, devemos acreditar que no mundo tudo tem rumo ao equilbrio. Com certeza somos muito primitivos para explicar como as coisas no nosso ambiente se movimentam sem esfor?os claros de qualquer indivduo. Talvez seja por causa do mundo que ns nos encontramos hoje, onde h muita coisa perdida e confusa, longe de uma idealiza??o de uma sociedade plural e globalmente unida. Mas todo o ser humano, seja de modo cientfico ou divino, acredita em uma origem, em uma grandeza espiritual ou natural que o originou, de princpios simtricos, que s?o manipulados de acordo com o que fazemos em nossas vidas.    Voc acredita que gera??es a frente e originadas de voc s?o capazes de chegar a um ponto de simetria? Onde de um lado da linha est o mundo e do outro todas as idealiza??es, for?as, rela??es e realiza??es, perfeita e proporcionalmente alinhados  humanidade organizada? Se hoje algo que desejamos realmente acontece  por que, desde j, estamos nos alinhando lentamente e sem cessar.

Se quiser algumas dicas, me escreva: fabjper17@yahoo.com|`|W4Z8fsNMaa	Na verdade,eu acredito que o universo trabalhe em modo de compensa??o e equilibrio.N?o cede nada sem cobrar o equivalente em troca e compensa as possiveis perdas com outros beneficios. claro que se voc se empenhar em algo e se empenhar ativamente nesse propsito,o universo vai compensar esse esfor?o.Mas para cada coisa que ele te conceder,vai exigir algo em troca.|`|f084502f2bc8d583d28a882bd942069aaa	quem procura acha  voc pode simplesmente se pensar que pode  nada vem por acaso  sorte ,e fracasso est na nossa mente   s visualizarmos o sucesso  que ele vem pode demorar mas ele vem.|`|sa7RfhYIaa	Como dizem, pensamento positivo faz milagres.

J aconteceu comigo, mas com fatos n?o muito importantes... e acho que se eu disse muitos v?o at rir:    Quando eu entrei no ensino mdio conheci vrios professores, e o que mais me assustou foi o de educa??o fsica, ele era grande e forte e violento. ai eu disse quando eu chegasse no 3o n?o queria estudar com ele, passei o 1o e o 2o ano dizendo a mim mesmo que n?o ia estudar com ele, ainda mais que muitos diziam que ele era cruel nas aulas.  dito e certo! no primeiro dia de aula do 3o ano, ano passado, quando eu cheguei na escola o professor foi l na sala e disse que ia se tranferir da escola!  J aconteceu tambm de eu estar lendo com pouca luz no meu quarto que tem acesso ao da minha m?e, ai eu n?o tava conseguindo ler direito, e quando percebi a lampada do quarto dela acendeu!  J aconteceu de eu ir na casa de uma colega e no mesmo momento ela saia da casa dela pra ir atrs de mim.  rsrsrs  n?o sei explicar|`|fLQtXR81aa	ACONTECE COMIGO|`|nXNAIAXRaa	Sabe que isso  uma coisa que me intriga mais que qualquer coisa no mundo?  Tanto a afirma??o quanto a retrica s?o verdadeiras, "quando precisamos falar com algum essa pessoa liga, quando precisamos de alguma coisa essa coisa aparece". Mas tambm, "quando precisamos demais falar com algum, essa pessoa viajou, sumiu, voc n?o acha nem com reza braba. E tambm quando voc precisa demais de alguma coisa, geralmente voc n?o tem".  Bem, o fato  que de um modo geral, a f move montanhas.   Talvez falte f quando mais precisamos?  Porque quando precisamos DEMAIS, tememos. A a f vacila.  Quando precisamos S UM POUQUINHO, a ficamos meio que anestesiados por aquele momento, s focamos "no que queremos", n?o no "medo de n?o conseguir aquilo que queremos."  Acho que a est a chave: Querer, mas nunca querer demais.  O medo  o pior dos "carrinhos". Derruba qualquer um.  N?o existe sorte nem azar.  S medo e f.

tRNDhk2Caa	I am personally a huge fan of the Villanelle.  It's not an easy form and takes a fair amount of skill and dedication just to create flow and consistency of thought and you have done just that.    I also like the change "In gratitude I sing this glad nocturne."  I could see your whale in his shelter deep and wide.  A lovely whale song indeed.|`|WbRuTjmFaa	I find the Vilanelle constricts and binds, I know that when I reworked mine I was happier with it, however it changed it to something else as now It had taken liberties with the form.    I wonder how far one is allowed to go with altering the structure before it is bastardized or crossbred, and if so, does that not give more beauty and flow to a piece of work ....|`|wWL934E8aa	I don't know about the form but this flows gently along and then.....    I stumbled over "To him I sing my song, a glad nocturne."    just me maybe, but I stumble on the word nocturne.  Maybe just because it is not in my 'everyday' vocabulary.    I do like this write.  It sings and paints a nice picture of where he abides.        |`|S9bEtVCSaa	I'd love to read this poem and comment - but I'm going to come back to it later.    Ok - I read it again. I love how your words make me feel like I'm on the ocean. I'm not sure about the meaning. I don't want to misinterpret your poem.     But it is a great example of a villanelle. I have one that I wrote a long time ago and I hated having to write it - just like the rondeau and other styles, but maybe I'll bring mine out and do some work - maybe post it again.|`|j37DL7WLaa	This is a really good Villanelle, the meter reads fine to me.  This is a difficult form to write successfully.  I think perhaps it is because of the amount of discipline and thought it takes to map it it out, and make it coherent and cohesive.    I can imagine a great humpbacked whale singing this!|`|n9hRyHpqaa	This what I know: you have ten syllables per line, and aba rhyme and a refrain.   As for the meter, 4 feet?  My brain can't deal with it. I didn't stumble.  For me it read  like rolling waves.|`|raU9c3tzaa	this, me would have to come back to.. one read was not enough!  edit : me loves this form. and the line "In gratitude I sing this glad nocturne." it speaks of whale and dolphins, and somehow it is more fit for the latter. this is a classical neat poetry with that slow beat, swift move, and smooth flow. a picture for the mind, as if you were calling for saving the whales. that is my opinion, but then know more. thanks for sharing this beautiful read..|`|1lCUPVAkaa	So be it, you'll fix it    It reads lovely.|`|Bh6NwFzeaa	That`s a Whale of a tale.  I Whaley mean it.
79YQAbSRaa	No.  Werewolves and vampires are magical in their own way.  Muggles are non-magic.  Even squibs were considered magical without performing magic.|`|uq1GXvSdaa	i dont know but maybe  halfbloods|`|daza5A4vaa	Nope.  I'd say they're magical creatures.  So, kind of in league with a blast ended skrewt (:    Muggles are not magical in any way.|`|YbwDFvEaaa	I believe the term "muggle" refers to people who are in no way involved in the magical/wizarding community. This is why squibs (people born to wizards with no magical power themselves) are not considered muggles...they are kept within the wizarding community, they just aren't wizards themselves.|`|IWaxUqDzaa	No, because a muggle is a non-magical being. A werewolf and vampire is a magical being, while say, a dog is not. (Unless it's an animagus :)|`|dE0vtX2eaa	no. i think they would be considered squibs. cause, to be a werewolf there is a certain amount of magic in you- and not being a witch/wizard meaning you have no control of your magic. so, ja, be a squib|`|V1hxvQukaa	no. muggle is someone who is not involved in magic at all. obviously, it's not normal to turn into a wolf and be a vampire. other creatures, like unicorns and centaurs don't have magic (at least the kind that requires a wand), but they are still part of the magical world. so are squibs, even though they have to magic either.|`|uhmWX5Qkaa	no they weren't, Fenir the werewolf wasn't considered muggle since he was in assiocation with Voldemort, so they were worthy unlike muggles.|`|Q4qghst7aa	no, they just are a different part of the wizarding world (along with hags and succubii)  although they do not have the same magical powers as witches and wizards, they are just as powerful and the two species acknowledge each other.|`|kYvF4ucVaa	no they r not muggles....muggles are humans without magic..lol...Hope I helped!|`|XGzC67P5aa	No. A muggle is someone with not a drop of magic blood in them (it says in the third Harry Potter book).     You could argue that vampires have no blood but in truth they are magic.|`|ek8iGsRfaa	Hmmm....interesting...they were probably just magical creatures like the vampire Sanguini or like Dobby or the Goblins...all of them are magical in some way, but they're not wizards.|`|phH2dVYZaa	No. For example, centaurs weren't muggles. They are different.    Plus werewolves could also hold a wand, anyway|`|aSG5lHrwaa	no they are only considered magical creatures .|`|2GdZSXC1aa	What an excellent question! I would say yes.|`|teZvmrPVaa	no, muggles have nothing to do with magic. werewolves and vampires are magical creatures that are part of the wizarding world. even squibs are not muggles even though they can't do magic. as long as you are somehow associated with magic, you are not a muggle.|`|j1DLyUnfaa	good question... well i think it depends for werewolves.  there can be wizard werewolves and vampires but we never hear of a muggle werewolf.  who knows?      i'm sending a letter to jk rowling and i'll ask her this.  if i get SUPER lucky she'll respond...|`|tSJFfk8Aaa	i think so because a muggle has no magical power and werewolves and vampires dont have any magical power.|`|90zIsbWWaa	No because they aren't human and muggles only refer to human beings who have no magical powers.
WvAwQmndaa	Hatshepsut reestablished the trade networks that had been disrupted during the Hyksos occupation of Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period, thereby building the wealth of the eighteenth dynasty.    She oversaw the preparations and funding for a mission to the Land of Punt. The expedition set out in her name with five ships, each measuring 70 feet (21 m) long bearing several sails and accommodating 210 men that included sailors and 30 rowers. Many trade goods were bought in Punt, notably myrrh.    Most notably, however, the Egyptians returned from the voyage bearing thirty-one live frankincense trees, the roots of which were carefully kept in baskets for the duration of the voyage. This was the first recorded attempt to transplant foreign trees. It is reported that Hatshepsut had these trees planted in the courts of her Deir el Bahri mortuary temple complex. Egyptians also returned with living Puntites (people of Punt). This trading expedition to Punt was roughly during Hatshepsut's nineteenth year of reign.    She had the expedition commemorated in relief at Deir el-Bahri, which also is famous for its realistic depiction of the Queen of the Land of Punt, Queen Iti, who appears to have had a genetic trait called steatopygia. Hatshepsut also sent raiding expeditions to Byblos and Sinai shortly after the Punt expedition. Very little is known about these expeditions. Although many Egyptologists have claimed that her foreign policy was mainly peaceful,[20] there is evidence that Hatshepsut led successful military campaigns in Nubia, the Levant, and Syria early in her career|`|PEjEOZ3Gaa	Although not a lot of records remain other than the walls of her tomb and obelisks are in existence, what there are indicate Hatshepsut reigned 1503-1482 BC. She devoted most of her time to increasing peace and prosperity by opening new trade opportunities for her nation rather than the usual pharaoh habit of looting and conquering.         She extended trade routes south along the Red Sea and as far west as Libya which sent her tribute and east to Asia and south to Nubia. It was conquest by business without war. She is also credited with an amazing administrative ability that kept the far flung enterprises working together.         The great prosperity enabled her to order an extensive building and renovation program, especially of the monuments and tombs damaged by the earlier rulers from Asia.

Also...one can only learn through "trials & error"...and...one gains inner strenght from "suffering" -or- going through hard times...which eventually lead to success.    I have some similar comparisons for you my sweetie:    It is possible to fail in many ways...while to succeed is possible only in one way.   Aristotle (384 BC - 322 BC    My mother drew a distinction between achievement and success. She said that 'achievement is the knowledge that you have studied and worked hard and done the best that is in you. Success is being praised by others, and that's nice, too, but not as important or satisfying. Always aim for achievement and forget about success.'   Helen Hayes (1900 - 1993)     I had to add the quote of Helen Hayes's MOm, which brought a huge scmile to my face...and I must admit....the essence and meaning of it is sooooo TRUE, Tracy....-smile-    Hope, you're enjoying both of them and apply them to your future !

Only through experience of trial and suffering can the soul be strengthened, ambition inspired, and success achieved.       Helen Keller (1880 - 1968)         James Gordon, M.D. Change has a considerable psychological impact on the human mind. To the fearful it is threatening because it means that things may get worse.

So far most of the answer have pointed out (illuminated) this point.

HUopAh4iaa	I love dialogue. But not followed by, "He said or she said" Or some dumb gesture like, "She fluttered her eyelashes wildly or He gave her a searing, beseeching look!" I would rather that the characters were so strong that by the third page you didn't need the extras, you could just imagine what was happening.     I hate any of the dreaming or nightmare sequences that just waste the readers time.    I am a huge fan of Dean Koontz as I like the way his characters interact. Try "Lightning." It was an awesome read.|`|ew9ymJClaa	hard one...  Books all have their own individual beginning.  When you write your own book it will have its own unique start.  All of my favourite(I spell like that 'cos I'm british) books start with the main character's thoughts and a change in the main character's everyday life. You always start books with a change so that there is plenty to describe and the reader doesn't feel left out. Never start with a fight scene, I once got a book that started like that and it was so dull I just dropped it in the bin, I totally agree with you. The only place where fight scenes work is Fruits Basket and that's because it's a comic strip and series of videos. Also don't fall into the trap of telling the audience exactly what your main character is like, let them find out for themselves. Otherwise there is no point in reading any more of the book.  It's hard to decide how to start it if you have not decided which person you are writing this from.  1st person main character-character talks about the change and the people around them but barely about themselves, this depends on the personality of this character of course.  1st person less main character-talking purely about the other people and they're problems and changes.  3rd person-this is where dialogue is advisable and a lot of description about the surroundings(but not too much or you'll turn into john steinbeck and we don't want that).  Good luck if you are writing you're own story! x|`|aFVzMM5laa	Stories should begin with action or dialog that sucks the reader in immediately and makes them want to know what happens next.   Humorous narrative can also work if the story is written in first-person POV.     I don't like stories that begin with people waking up from dreams, or running from someone/something. Both of these have been overdone.|`|1UY2o5lDaa	a brief, rather unexplained, but intense flashback  it draws the reader right into the story, allows for a lot of character development, and keeps people reading because they want to know more about it, and what happened in between the flashback and the rest of the story, and where everything's going to end up due to what happened at the very start :)    Dialogue is great, but only if it doesn't drag on for too long  as in "he said, then she said, then she said, and then he said"  thoughts should be included - Dialogue normally doesn't hold enough truth for someone to really relate or understand the characters :)X|`|AAgX0SDcaa	I am amused and interested with a quirky beginning, something that may be different than the title or theme of the movie.

Good question by the way.  =)|`|35JIECGRaa	Certain beginnings are good for certain things. This example is actually from a TV show, but oh well ...    In Cardcaptors, it begins with Sakura having a dream, and she doesn't know what it means. Then she wakes up, late for school, etc ... but in other episodes, she still has that same dream, and later that dream comes true. And I love that it starts like that because it shows what will happen in the future, and during the other episodes, it shows the events leading up to what happens in the dream.    Same goes for books. I like books to begin so that I have an idea of what will happen in the story (I love to predict things).|`|AA11586196	Any way you choose to open a story can work, and work well (even waking from a nightmare, as you mentioned). I like stories that open with action, or with dialogue, or even with a brief descriptive introduction to the setting or character.  What I don't like are long, monotonous paragraphs of exposition that tell me what the author should be showing me. that needs to be cut out and remedied in the 2nd or 3rd draft.|`|TYQOafA8aa	If you start right to action the reader wont have a clue of what's the background of the character and all, I say you need to tell who and where the character is, then you create the situation and then you go to the action part.
kuA09bzVaa	I have discovered that you are trying to make a revisionist history. Operation Bagration was instittuted only after the Allies had an assured victory. Read an authoritative history, not something off of utube, or wikipedia. The Russians were only able to do what they did because of the two front war. Why your idolization of Russia comes about, I have no idea. You say the person erroneously stated something. What proof do you have to say someone else is in error?|`|AA11657414	So, pose yourself this question    If the German Armies that were in Russia were lined up in France, would Eisenhower even have gotten ashore? Doubtful.    But pose the reverse.....If the million Germans in France and Italy had been available for the Russian Front, how would Stalingrad turned out? Would there ever have been a Kursk?     It took 100% of Russia and 95% of the British Empire and 85% of the USA's efforts to drag Nazi Germany down....to say one of the Allies alone could have beaten Germany just isn't, er, accurate.|`|WZNaNvplaa	Not familiar with Operation Bagration, but as an American, yes, I'm familiar with most of the others. And of many more Soviet offensives that ground down the German military forces. D-Day was a turning point in that it was the clearest indication that American forces were in fact out to crush the Nazi regime into unconditional surrender. After almost three years of preparation and less decisive engagements, D Day stood out. Certainly, the Soviet Union would have eventually crushed Nazi Germany, even without D Day. But with D Day the war was shortened by several months.      I don't think there is anything malicious in people's ignorance. There simply is so much history and so little time to teach it in schools that it's natural that people focus on those events that involved them more. And too few take it on themselves to do the extra research to gain a better picture of how huge a conflict WW 2 really was.|`|MFF61HvDaa	Operation Bagration was larger than D-Day and was such a success due to threat of D-Day. During Bagration the Germans were out-numbered 3 to 1 in men and equipment. If the Germans weren't defending Normandy against the allies those troops and the equipment would of been used in the Eastern theatre and the Germans would of had a better chance against Bagration.    If it wasn't for the Atlantic Ocean, the English Channel and the war in the Pacific, America and her allies would of sent a much larger army  to Europe much sooner.  Russia didn't have to cross a large body of water and could concentrate all her resources on one front. If the Allies weren't battling the Japanese, they would of attacked Russia from the East and then Russia wouldn't of had the resources to launch Operation Bagration.    Edit:  Opposing Operation Bagration were approximtely 800,000 Germans, in June of 1944, there were 850,000 Germans in France including 46 infantry divisions and 9 panzer divisions. Those divisions could of made a big difference against Bagration.    I've heard  few  references to D-Day as the turning point of the war, but I've heard many refer to it as the turning point of the war in the west.  In my opinion, the turning point of the war was when the Russians stopped the German blitzkreig for the first time during the Battle of Moscow.
cciB0SmBaa	What's,    Get yourself a few books on writing in general. Grammar, Dialogue, Points of View. These are all important in writing. Stephen King has a wonderful book on writing called "On Writing."     When you write, do it the same way you speak and act in real life. Be the character. Argue with yourself when speaking for two characters at a time. I'm sure you've had a few wonderful come-backs for those who ticked you off in the past.     Don't force yourself to write. Write it out so that your mind is free and clear of anything that pertains to 'a story.' Let the story come to you, if you know what I mean. Remember too, that descriptive data can be very boring. You don't want to tell the reader what's going on, you want to show them. Let them get what I call 'a mind's eye view' of what you're seeing and putting in writing.     I love your honesty here. At least you know where your flaws are. You can fix them.     Good luck!    PJ M|`|wYF6U6qlaa	I disagree with all the folks suggesting you use a thesaurus.  I can always tell when someone has used one and it often makes their writing sound a little foolish.  Thesauruses are not good at conveying the feel of a word, and if you don't know the word yourself you have a good chance of misusing it.  I seriously once graded a short story that included the sentence "I imbibed the delectable hot dog."     The best writers add variety and color by using literary devices like metaphors, personifications and similes.    What sentence sounds better:    We prostrated beneath the salubrious trees, whose leaves gesticulated in the direction of our domiciles.    or    We stretched out beneath the gentle oaks, their leaves reaching toward the farmhouses as if they longed to sleep in our beds and warm their branches at our hearths.    If you need a dictionary to write it, your reader may need a dictionary to understand it.  Always use the simplest word that conveys the idea you want.      My advice is to read as much as you can from writers those styles you admire.  You'll learn new words and conventions naturally, and incorporate them naturally into your writing.    Good luck :)|`|3wAkbWqSaa	Adjectives and adverbs!!!!!!  Adding those in a sentence can make your writing much more interesting. Use a thesaurus to find new and exciting adjectives.  Good luck on your writing!|`|9Duha1k4aa	it would help if you could remember your own name?    let your mind flow freely, make a spider diagram with your ideas on and expand on them. Eventually, your ideas will develop.    Also, when you are about to use a word like "nice", refrain from doing so. Use a thesaurus or pull up another cool word.|`|LVZdzPmpaa	Practice makes perfect. No one comes to writing bursting with talent and creativity. Writing is a skill and craft that is perfected over time with practice and experience.    If you want to write, you must read. A lot. Reading expands your vocabulary and exposes  you to the many different styles and techniques writers use.    As for grammar, there are not "some things" to remember. All aspects of grammar are important and intertwined; it's not as though certain elements get priority over others.    Grammar is like driving a car: it is a package deal. You don't pay attention to the speed limit but ignore the need to use turn signals. You don't focus on staying in your lane to the extent that you run over anything that gets in your path. Grammar, like driving, is a multi-facted discipline. It too takes practice and experience.    Again, reading helps some. Study helps, too. Knowing when to turn to a reference book on grammar is important. Over time, hopefully you  develop a sense for grammar. It comes easy for some people; others seem to never get a good grasp of it.    Adverbs, by the way, are often referred to as "weasel words." Adverbs are merely an excuse for being too lazy to find a better word. Use adverbs sparingly. Circle the "-ly" words in your work and find better words to replace those the adverbs are modifying.     Stephen King's non-fiction book on writing ("On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft") is one of my favorite books on the subject. He writes about how he came to be a writer and talks about the writing life. The second half of the book is more or less an invaluable "how-to." King is forthright and generous with this comments and advice. Check it out.    I do think it's a good thing that you recognize that your writing needs some work. With that kind of awareness, you are sure to improve.|`|CwNMq7RTaa	You don't have to be creative in words.  What matters is that the content of what you are saying is interesting.  If you describe something interesting in simple words, it's still interesting.  Using fancy words doesn't make a piece of writing interesting.  That being said, if you want to find more words, get a thesaurus.  It gives a list of alternate words for every word.|`|SVqPTnZyaa	Try looking at things in a different way. You might be looking, but not really seeing.   Invoke feelings, and emotions. Do not just say the grass is green, mean it.     'The grass like an emerald shined green with perfection'.    The difficulty in writing is that sometimes less is more. Figuring out when a sentence needs more, and when it's good on it's own is a personal style. Write who you are!

During its existence and the time of its sojourn in the body of matter, it has undergone a change; it has undergone energy evolution and survives only as a part of the cosmic forces of the universe; it does not survive as individual life. The survival of mortal creatures is wholly predicated on the evolvement of an immortal soul within the mortal mind. Page 404-3|`|YtcMZaUNaa	Another way to ask this question is: Are we merely mortal?  Do we have a soul?  Energy cannot be created nor destroyed, but that doesn't mean we will still exist after death (I am not saying that we do or don't.  I don't know).  Our energy is retained, but it may just be our physical body that decays into the ground like fertilizer.  Or we may have some sort of psychical existence after death.  Who knows.|`|WVXVeN8Gaa	Life, in one sense, is the ability to manipulate physical reality, which is constantly in flux. So, if one were, or desired to "destroy life", one would seek a static reality. A reality in which everything is a constant, where the fabric of space-time would be as idle as a stagnant body of water, where all its participants would be similar to cardboard cutouts.    Is life a cause or an effect? That is, is life the effect of a particular "force" or "energy" as you've stated, or is it the underlying cause behind these forces and energies we experience daily.    I'm not entirely sure, but I am quite curious as to why you want to know such incomprehensible and abstract information which no human can possibly know, or even begin to understand.|`|d265DZbHaa	Life is more than energy. If it were then all one would have to do would be to swallow a battery to keep you alive.
Y8kjVeLyaa	I did this one...I will re-write in in modern language...basically she is lying...she is pretending to her son that the men have raped her..they have not...this is an evil woman...but do not ACT evil...act like you think this really happened...liars and evil people almost never come across like that. So...    Don't you think I've got a good reason to look pale?  These two have enticed me here (brought me here with lies)  A bleak and hated place you see it is...  Even though it is summer, the trees have no leaves,  they are covered in moss and miserable misletoe,  The sun never shines here, nothing breeds (no nice creatures)  UNless you count owls and ravens...  when they showed me this horrible place, they told me that in the middle of the night,   a thousand monsters, ten thousane fat toads as many urchins,  would make such a terrible frightening noise   that anybody hearing it would go mad or die.  As soon as they had told me this   they told me they would tie me up here   to this yew tree  and leave me to die  Then they said I was an adultress  a slutty Goth (Goths were actually a race of people)  and all the worst names that I ever heard in my life  HAd you not come here by luck,  they would have done all this,  Get revenge, If you love your Mother,  Or I will disown you.    As for how to say it...look at Shakespeares punctuation...where there is a comma give a slight pause...full stop...stop.|`|TufsEE2baa	Overcome with moss and baleful mistletoe.    mistletoe is a weed it kills the other plants around it,     He believes that he is cursed buy the Goths and believes their immoral sexual nature has polluted his people against him.

AA11142708	In the aesthetic religious traditions, truth is the actual experience of truth--you know it when you experience it. Truth will not be found in language--it must be experienced. The reason for this is that in the Eastern traditions truth is not about the truth, rather, its about how we come to experience truth. A fully known thing, however, has two components, both are equally real and primary, and hence good, the one being the complement of the other. We know truth first by inspection-- it must be an immediately experienced, aesthetically and emotionally felt thing, and second (and this is what is emphasized in the West) truth is tautological (mathematics and logic) or it becomes whatever is hypothetically conceived and experimentally verified--the discovery of scientific facts.|`|B4YlBDzhaa	Process of Elimination.

Long, long ago the Sumerian culture existed, it was the first truly massive civilization, they flourished for hundreds of years but eventually they collapsed under their own weight. They destroyed all of the forests in the land to use as fuel for their great furnaces and land for their people to live on, when they ran out of space they conquered the neighboring cultures. Eventually the soil would not support enough food because of nutrient loss and rapid erosion. Almost the exact same thing happened to the Greek and later Roman civilizations, but our current population has only expanded so fast because of fossil fuel use. The same way the other great civilizations used all of the wood and minerals that they could find until there was no more we're using all of the fossil fuels in the world, but these took millions of years to create. The depression that is now rampant in the Western world is a sign of the times, it's caused many times by feelings of isolation, this is increasingly common in the world as we are going through a massive "compartment-ization," everyone lives in their little apartment, drives to work and is stuck in a small space for 8 hours a day.    The humans that existed before us, and still exist in some places, as hunter-gatherers worked or hunted for food for 2 to 3 hours a day and then had recreation and family time, and an average height of 5 feet 11 inches. Modern societies didn't even approach this rate until the 1950s when antibiotics and more advanced drugs began taking over.    We are getting away from our old way of life entirely, everyone is fighting against each other and we are destroying the planet. In 40 or 50 years when the oil runs out our children will tell their children of a time when fresh air, trees and animals surrounded everything but they wont be able to believe them when they see their environment. This planet's population is expanding rapidly by using all of the oil that the planet has to offer but when we reach our biggest point ever, in 40 or 50 years as I said, we will run out of oil. No one can imagine what the ensuing chaos from the massive food shortages will look like, cities will fall but the areas with more land will hopefully be alright. They can learn an entirely new way of life, get every book on farming that they can find and start over with minimal if any electricity.

1TPGdaXJaa	It depends what you mean by seeing I think...    If you mean the way you "see" or interpret a situation, I think our own consciousness will give us our individual perspective on something, and therefore you may not have the same view as others.      If you mean "seeing" as in visually - I think it is more our senses than our consciousness that forms or otherwise prevents the way we see things. From the perspective of physics and psychology, the world is perceived by our eyes as beautiful and colorful, as light reflects off of or is absorbed by an object. But, what would the world truly "look" like if you didn't see it through human or other animal eyes? You have matter, which is all energy vibrating at different frequencies, reacting with other matter and light energy - I mean who can say?|`|Rg2ERXAtaa	yes,mine does  not sure weather to be glad or scared|`|4C2HqrLmaa	it might it might not who knows if we have a consciousness it will prevent us from knowing it blocking are eyes|`|XXc15qzzaa	Interesting question.   I'm going to say No, but I believe that we are not able to see everything that makes this universe go round. Like time. Time is different the farther you get away from the earth's core. So on top of a mountain time literally goes faster. (no joke, you shoud look it up).  But I think that even without our 'conciousness' as you say, being in it's current state is what prevents us.  I believe that humanity innately knows there must be something more out there than what we can see and feel and know.  The top athiests in the world, like Richard Dawkins for instance, can only go so far back before they reach the conclusion that the primordial ooze we supposively come from was created by something else. Dawkins says aliens are a possible answer.  Seriously, we are trying so hard to believe that there can't be a God who loves us enough to create us and give us free will that we fight tooth and nail to prove he doesn't exist. I always come back to God no matter how far and hard I search. As do many others much more involved in science than I. (try reading the Case for Christ, it's interesting no matter what you believe).|`|BPrMusoLaa	Yes it does! Everything we do in life is concious, in our minds. Thats where the phrase ''mind over matter'' comes in and ''think therefore you are''. Just like my astrological being I am very detail oriented I get consumed with the little thing in life and what I am trying to accomplish. The same thing goes for our concious being. This allows us to go forward or either step back away from the situation at hand. Sometime we stop ourselves from doing things whether they are good or bad and a lot of times we end up crying our would've should've could'ves.....Think about it and if you dont feel me read this two more times because I know its true. I could go on but I am at work...LOL
94bc2dec827aab848ba69cb5895f7ba6aa	She's probably the most badly-misquoted woman in history.  She meant 'let them eat brioche', in other words, open up the royal breadstores to the peasants.  'Brioche' was the only type of bread she ever knew, a very fine light type of stuff; which was very badly mistranslated as 'cake.'    So when she said this, she was offering the royals' surplus of bread to the peasants.|`|AA10729675	The sentence was preceding by another said by someone else:  "the people of Paris are starving; they do not have bread". So, frivolously, she said: let them eat "brioche".  Brioche in French is a sort of cake, made of flour etc... and it corresponds to what we called Panettone but without the raisins in it.   It means that she was not aware of what was going on, that she did not care.  Brioche was in fact better than bread.  So, she wished people to have even better than bread to eat.  But why was she so ignorant of what was happening?    That is the question.    Especially since while she was in jail, she completely changed and became very thoughtful of others and very courageous, too.  And before going to the guillotine she forgave the people of Paris.    so, in other words, had she been let aware of what was going on, and if she had been given some political function, she would have acted differently.|`|AA10267825	she meant let them eat....cake.|`|dSQxCGbJaa	Apparently someone else said it long before her...dunno who though    Although it's often translated as cake, the word "brioche" (which she actually says) is a type of bread. She got a lot of bad press for it because it was thought she meant it in a callous way, but there are other theories on what she meant;    Check out this link for the other theory;  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_them_ea...|`|2z1h5mfOaa	Copied from the website with link below:  The original French is Qu'ils mangent de la brioche. It has been suggested that the speaker's intention wasn't as cynical as is generally supposed. French law required bakers to sell loaves at fixed prices and fancy loaves had to be sold at the same price as basic breads. This was aimed at preventing bakers from selling just the more profitable expensive products. The let them eat brioche (a form of cake made of flour, butter and eggs) would have been a sensible suggestion in the face of a flour shortage as it would have allowed the poor to eat what would otherwise have been unaffordable. It's rather a mouthful, so to speak, but if the phrase had been reported as 'let them buy cake at the same price as bread' we might now think better of the French nobility.     Two notable contemporaries of Marie-Antoinette - Louis XVIII and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, attribute the phrase to another source. In Louis XVIII's memoir Relation d'un voyage a Bruxelles et d Coblentz (1791) he states that the phrase 'Que ne mangent-ils de la cro?te de pat?' (Why don't they eat pastry?) was used by Marie-Thrse (1638-83), the wife of Louis XIV. That account was published almost a century after Marie-Thrse's death though, so it must be treated with some caution.|`|Gox4ol8Zaa	This is supposedly where it came from.. Louid XVI told marie ant. that everyone was starving, because there was no bread, and she supposedly said, 'then let them eat cake.'  but people are unsure what she meant. Becaue it hasn't been correctly translated, and it is unclear whether she was saying it in a good way, or a bad way...its often misunderstood...|`|CMsceWkUaa	Naz F probably has the best and most accurate answer to this question.  "Let them eat cake" was the supposed response by Marie Antoinette when someone said that the french peasants had no bread to live on. Cake was obviously only available to those who could afford it and it was seen as a desperately insensitive thing to say when french peasants were starving.|`|lVAe2SLXaa	That was a lie, made up as an excuse to have her head cut off.|`|b3456135bf4f0f591eca2857f5c90758aa	Marie Antoinette was a silly sheltered woman , when told the populace had no bread to eat she innocently thought that it meant a shortage of bread and immediately thought of another source of food which she had in plenty cake , history makes out it was a cynical reply of a spoilt brat of a woman . but how would a woman that had never mixed with the populace know anything about their problems , such things would have been far below her station and the situation would never have occurred to her .|`|2kl0vQjVaa	Nothing ~ she never said it!|`|26c3882c8862fb989b196c0d5e86733aaa	Lost in translation.    She spoke in the French of the period, and used the word "brioche", which certainly is NOT "cake".|`|6ubffIyWaa	She didn't actually say it, it was myth set up to show how the French royale family had no idea about the poverty in the country.    Marie was supposed to of said this when she was brought the news that many were starving to death as they could not afford to buy bread. The quote "Let them eat cake" is to show how stupid she was (even though she really didn't say it) as if they can't afford bread how are they supposed to afford cake?|`|nYRkAmdtaa	The poor had no bread to eat ( because they could ill afford it )  she is quoted as saying " let them eat cake "  the problem was she is reputed to have thought it was a viable option and her remark was said to be serious . Needless to say her head hit the basket ( not the bread one ) my remark not hers .|`|uurgL3oZaa	It illustrated how out of touch the aristocracy was with the common man. See, there was a flour shortage at the time, so somebody explained to her that the peasantry were starving because they couldn't make bread, so she utters that famous phrase, completely ignorant to the fact that cake has flour in it too. These aren't the sort of people the general population usually wants running a country. This sort of general attitude/ignorance is why Mrs. Antoinette and her pals had the privilege of getting up close and personal with the guillotine.|`|w6Lu2Oesaa	it's like me saying "dude, meh, fvk it, whatever, I don't care, etc......"|`|WvAwQmndaa	The origin of many phrases in English are unknown. Nevertheless, many people would say that they know the source of this one. It is widely attributed to Marie-Antoinette (1755-93), the Queen consort of Louis XVI. She is supposed to have said this when she was told that the French populace had no bread to eat.

DenLZAL1aa	The Canadian Pacific Railway (reporting mark CP), known as CP Rail between 1968 and 1996, is a Canadian Class I railway operated by Canadian Pacific Railway Limited. Its rail network stretches from Vancouver to Montreal, and also serves major cities in the United States such as Minneapolis, Chicago, and New York City. Its headquarters are in Calgary, Alberta.    The railway was originally built between eastern Canada and British Columbia between 1881 and 1885 (connecting with Ottawa Valley and Georgian Bay area lines built earlier), fulfilling a promise extended to British Columbia when it entered Confederation in 1871. It was Canada's first transcontinental railway. Now primarily a freight railway, the CPR was for decades the only practical means of long distance passenger transport in most regions of Canada, and was instrumental in the settlement and development of Western Canada.     The CP company became one of the largest and most powerful in Canada, a position it held as late as 1975.[1] Its primary passenger services were eliminated in 1986 after being assumed by VIA Rail Canada in 1978. A beaver was chosen as the railway's logo because it is one of the national symbols of Canada and represents the hardworking character of the company. The object of both praise and condemnation for over 120 years, the CPR remains an indisputable icon of Canadian nationalism.  The Canadian Pacific Railway is a public company with over 15,000 employees and market capitalization of 7 billion USD in 2008    Creation of the Canadian Pacific Railway was a task originally undertaken for a combination of reasons by the Conservative government of Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald. British Columbia had insisted upon a transport link to the east as a condition for joining the Confederation of Canada (initially requesting a wagon road). The government however, proposed to build a railway linking the Pacific province to the eastern provinces within ten years of July 20, 1871. Macdonald also saw it as essential to the creation of a unified Canadian nation that would stretch across the continent. Moreover, manufacturing interests in Quebec and Ontario desired access to sources of raw materials and markets in Canada's west.

On the other hand despite what the media tries to tell us, some teenagers make great parents and pregnancy is a blessing to them. A friend of mine got pregnant when she was fifteen, but she was always really good with kids and she was never going to do that well in school, so although it was kind of scary fro her at first, it wasn't sad that she got pregnant and now she's a really good Mum to her little boy.  To some up, I think it depends on the circumstances  xxx|`|CwNMq7RTaa	No, I get angry.  I think of the baby growing up without a father, in an unstable environment with a procession of boyfriends walking in and out, some of whom will abuse the child.  I think of all that misery because someone thought they had a 'right' to 'have' a baby, with no thought to what a baby needs.     Then let them get married, Boom.  None of these girls you see today, are.    Sabrina, does her boy ever see his Daddy?  When are adults going to get it that it's not about THEM.
Lpf6Eu3eaa	First, you have to decide what his accomplishments were. Did he preserve the Union? Definitely. Though he did it at the cost of civil liberties, and by fighting a war that cost hundreds of thousands of lives(I'm not disputing the rightness or wrongness of this decision, only that he made the commitment to do so and carried through until he succeeded). So no, not overrated. Was he the Great Liberator of slaves? Not so much. At the time he released the Emancipation Proclamation, the war was shifting in the North's favor, but the war by no means had been decided. The Proclamation only had meaning if the war was won, and even then it didn't'[t guarantee the freedom of all slaves. Those slave holding states that stayed loyal to the Union were exempt. So, while he should get lots of credit, that accomplishment is probably overrated.  The other thing to remember is that during his own day, Lincoln was a polarizing figure. Hated by almost everyone in the South, loathed and ridiculed by his political enemies in the North, his greatest achievement was in managing to actually carry out his policies. With modern politics, and the media, it would be hard to say if a Lincoln could survive, much less be successful, in such an eenvironment  2 days ago     PLain and simple........yes|`|GUCozOpWaa	Yes he was. Lincoln was a pragmatist. He used what he had to get the job done in a way that was practical. Read his first and second inaugural addresses. It seems like you are reading two different people.|`|WZNaNvplaa	First, you have to decide what his accomplishments were. Did he preserve the Union? Definitely.

With modern politics, and the media, it would be hard to say if a Lincoln could survive, much less be successful, in such an eenvironment|`|bdnMQnVHaa	Yes.  His whole agenda and what he is credited for, "freeing the slaves" and "saving the union" all hinged on military campaigns.  As he was not a general he had little impact on these campaigns.  In fact he was not a very good war time president.  He chose terrible commanding generals that lost most battles than won.  The only reason the north won the Civil War is because it had an advantage in population and industry.    He did not free the slaves, he only issued an order freeing those in states that were already in rebellion, rather meaningless because he had no political control over those states.  He did not free them in border states where he did have political control.  And he did not save the union.  Military campaigns determined that.  Had the north lost the Civil War, Lincoln would be considered one of the worst presidents today.|`|WvAwQmndaa	I think in a way it was, but this is true with any famous person who was tragically murdered. John kennedy's accomplishments, some say, are overrated after his death.     they both did accomplish very much... but they could have accomplished more if they hadn't been taken so soon. The lost potential for greatness is filled by the public's imaginations of what they could have been.    This is what i think when you say his accomplishments were overrated.|`|jbGsNRh8aa	Not at all.  His accomplishments were amazing.  Read "Team of Rivals" by Doris Kearns Goodwin.  Most historians rate him the best president ever.|`|O7w6XGqPaa	He saved the Union, something of import not only to Americans. A restored union meant that in the struggles for liberty in the twentieth century, the US added its weight as a united country rather than as two belligerents who likely would have allied with different sides. The World Wars would then have been fought in North America as well as the Old World.|`|hQ95u9OLaa	No. The war between the states, while resulting in the Emancipation Proclamation was really about whether the United States would stay united or fall. Almost to a man the country, sick of the killing wanted the war to be over no matter the cost. There were literally riots in New York over drafting men to fight for the union. But one man stood for the union and he was Abraham Lincoln.    An image of Lincoln with his arms stretching across the union holding it together with his bare hands is not entirely inappropriate.

Synopsis    Published in 1940, The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter is considered McCullers' finest work. The focus of the work is on John Singer, a deaf-mute in a Georgia mill town during the 1930s, and on his effect on the people who confide in him. When Singer's mute Greek companion of 10 years goes insane, Singer is left alone and isolated. He takes a room with the Kelly family, where he is visited by the town's misfits, who turn to him for understanding but have no knowledge of his inner life. The book's emphasis on individuals who are considered outcasts because of race, politics, disability, or sensibility placed it squarely within the Southern gothic tradition of American literature.      ...And yes, I would recommend it to you.|`|dnG7fhnbaa	I've read Ugly by Constance Briscoe too...not read her second book yet though.

And, of course, he'll stop at nothing to guarantee success.)    or    Girl, missing  (Lauren has always known she was adopted but when a little research turns up the possibility that she was snatched from an American family as a baby, suddenly Lauren's life seems like a sham. How can she find her biological parents? And are her adoptive parents really responsible for kidnapping her?

But the circumstances of her disappearance are murky and Lauren's kidnappers are still at large and willing to do anything to keep her silent...)|`|SVqPTnZyaa	I loved the serious Stravaganza, the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants is also a good serious.

DvToP5h7aa	Grapes of Wrath - John Steinbeck    Chapter Twenty-Nine:    ?The winter rains hit California hard, soaking and flooding the fields and orchards.    ?Rain means no work for the migrant workers; no work means no food for the thousands of starving families.    ?People can't get dry, diseases thrive, and the cars die from having been soaked with water.    ?Many grow desperate for food, resorting to robbery in order to survive.    ?Landowners and merchants gather guns and tighten their security to protect themselves from the wrath of the workers and their families.    ?Eventually the rain stops, but the families know there will be no work until springtime.    http://www.shmoop.com/event/literature/j...    ======================================...    Chapter Thirty:    ? The rain keeps pounding down on the camp, and the creek out in front of the boxcars begins to swell.    ? Rose of Sharon is feverish and sick.    ? Pa convinces a bunch of men to help him dig troughs to keep the creek's water from rising. They dig tirelessly.    ? Rose of Sharon goes into labor, and Ma and Mrs. Wainwright help her through her contractions.    ? The men outside continue to dig away, but a big cottonwood tree is swept up by the creek-turned-mini-raging-river, and it floats downstream. The tree gets stuck a little ways down, making the water rise even faster.    ? The men are freaked out by the flood, and they are also freaked out by Rose of Sharon's ear-piercing screams.    ? Eventually, the ear-piercing screaming stops. Pa goes inside the boxcar to check out the situation.    ? Mrs. Wainwright shows Pa the blue corpse of a baby.    ? At this point, the water has climbed up to the boxcars and cars and is inches thick.    ? Al tries to start the Joad truck, but the engine has been killed by the water.    ? Other campers become furious at Pa Joad for convincing them to stay and fight the flood with levy-building tactics. Now, no one's car will start, and everyone is stranded.    ? Pa and Al build a platform in the boxcar to keep the family dry. The water level is now ankle deep in the boxcar.    ? Ma, Pa, John, Rose of Sharon, Ruthie, and Winfield decide to find a drier and safer place.    ? Al decides to stay with the Wainwrights and to look out for the Joad possessions.    ? The Joads stumble across a barn, and they go inside to take shelter from the rain.    ? Inside, they find a little boy sitting next to man who is starving to death. The boy tells them that his father has not eaten anything in six days.    ? Ma and Rose of Sharon exchange a meaningful look, and then Rose of Sharon asks everyone to leave her alone with the man in the barn.    ? Rose of Sharon lies down next to the half-starved man, she puts his mouth to her breast, and she lets him drink her breast milk.    ? A mysterious smile comes across Rose of Sharon's face.    ?

God has given us himself that we may be like him, and he has reserved for himself of power and glory only that which is necessary for the maintenance of those things for the love of which he has thus divested himself of all things else.    5. THE ETERNAL AND DIVINE PURPOSE              There is a great and glorious purpose in the march of the universes through space. All of your mortal struggling is not in vain. We are all part of an immense plan, a gigantic enterprise, and it is the vastness of the undertaking that renders it impossible to see very much of it at any one time and during any one life. We are all a part of an eternal project which the Gods are supervising and outworking. The whole marvelous and universal mechanism moves on majestically through space to the music of the meter of the infinite thought and the eternal purpose of the First Great Source and Center.              The eternal purpose of the eternal God is a high spiritual ideal. The events of time and the struggles of material existence are but the transient scaffolding which bridges over to the other side, to the promised land of spiritual reality and supernal existence. Of course, we mortals find it difficult to grasp the idea of an eternal purpose; we are virtually unable to comprehend the thought of eternity, something never beginning and never ending.

65109cb8f29d34e3d6fc411bd1edae58aa	That camera uses some very rare film. NOS film comes up on eBay every now and then. There is a current listing as of this writing:    http://cgi.ebay.com/Vintage-Kodak-EK6-In...        You can also do a mod with Spectra film as written here:    "There is one way to use fresh stock in these cameras...    All you need is an empty Kodak film pack and some Polaroid Spectra film.    In the dark, you can load individual Spectra exposures into the Kodak pack.    Keep in mind that the Spectra film will protrude from the Kodak pack a tad bit and there isn't much room to trim from the Spectra to make it fit properly (the bottom of an exposure is the chemical pod and the top is the trap end) but the camera will close.    Finally load the film cover from the Spectra pack. You can trim this piece before inserting it.    At this point you can load the camera, but there is one major caveat:    Spectra film has a rated speed of 640 ASA and the original Kodak film was 150 I believe. That's two stops' difference and the camera, unfortunately, has a range of only about one I believe. To solve this problem, you only need to place a neutral density filter over the lens or, perhaps, a piece large enough to cover the opening on top of the film pack to compensate for overexposure.    One other minor issue is the Spectra image is taller and more narrow than the Kodak, so near the top (or the bottom, depending on the position of the exposure) there will be a small unexposed area."    http://www.flickr.com/groups/vintagecame...|`|k8AcVixTaa	nope - that film was discontinued and Polaroid won't work.  The EK6 is nothing more than a doorstop or curiosity.  Kodak was ordered by the courts to stop making the film after Polaroid successfully sued the over copyright infringement.

nqbcJjHyaa	In the USA federal law requires a nude model to be 18 years old or have written parental permission. The law also requires the photographer to be a minimum of 18 years or have written parental permission. If either aspect of the law is broken, you can face serious problems. I taught a high school photography class and this was always one of the topics I had questions on and had to enforce.|`|qXAvXHdYaa	Whatever the age of consent is is a good rule to start.    Also, if they look too young, then always error on the side of caution.|`|00f9b13066000aa39eb7b7036e571513aa	it might be different outside of the usa but i dont think i would take nude pics of anyone under eighteen even if it is for art, you wouldnt want to get charged for underage porn when that is not what it is however you know some people will turn art into something negative|`|RDk8pXvyaa	The age of 18 + legal written consent are pretty much mandatory while going down that path.

I know that sounds harsh but that's just the way it is. Such a charge will likely result in prison time and upon release/parole you'll be required to register as a Sex Offender. When you apply for a job that requires a background check your name will show up as a registered sex offender.    So if you're going to be engaging in nude photography be 100% certain that your subject is at least 18 and has verifiable proof. A picture I.D. and a copy of their birth certificate should suffice.
gW0nD5cEaa	The thing I always remember, one of the few, in fact, I ever remember about WWI was a teacher in high school said "World War I started as the world's biggest family feud'.     That is, all the royalty in Europe were either siblings, cousins, nephews, etc. The Archduke, or heir to the Austrian throne was murdered by a Serbian (Yugoslavian) rebel, who wanted his country to be free of the rule of Austria-Hungary. The Russian Czar actually was backing independence for the Serbs. Russia was thought to be part of the conspiracy. Russia was allies with England (and the Czar and King were cousins) and France, which no longer had a king; but anyway the kings were against the other cousins, Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany and I forget the name of the Austrian Emperor. Despite what someone said, Austria and Germany did not go to war against each other, Germany and Austria were allied, called the Central Powers, and Britain, France, Russia and later the US were the Allies, like they were in WWI.      So at first, it was a lot of royal cousins sending their armies into battle. As time went on, Britain got more and more aid from America, and we eventually joined. That is complicated, I'd suggest you look it up. I believe, unlike WWII, Italy was on the side of the allies. There were some other countries involved, but US, after 1917, Britain and all it's colonies, France, Russia, until they dropped out due to the revolution; vs Germany and AUstria-Hungary.     One of the worst things about WWI was the use of mustard gas and other chemical weapons. ALso planes were used in warfare for the first time, as were tanks. SOme of it seems fairly primitive today, but they were very advanced for the time.|`|N86vHKxtaa	There were specific treaty obligations on each side.  The Central Powers (German Empire, Austro-Hungarian Empire, Ottoman Empire) had agreed that they would respond to any attack or threat from another country.  Likewise, the Allies were bound by the Triple Entente (France, Britain and Russia) which guaranteed that they would join the war if a member country was attacked.  The US joined the Allies later after German submarines sank merchant shipping.    When Archduke Francis Ferdinand (heir to the Austro-Hungarian Empire) and his wife were assassinated in Serbia, the demands on the Serbs by the Empire were a threat to Russia.  Given the way war was fought then, the Austro-Hungarian Empire had to mobilize their army which prompted the Russians to do the same.  In support of their treaty obligations, Germany then mobilized.  However, German war plans called for an attack on France because that was the greater threat to Germany.  France and Britain then joined the mobilization in support of Russia and in response to Germany's implied threat to France.  There was also an issue with the neutrality of Belgium which the Germans intended to violate.    There's a lot more but that's the gist of it.|`|JopMJ9Woaa	alajuneshley,    Austria-Hungary did not declare war on Germany, Germany was actually their allie they declared war on Serbia.

The twin brothers! romulus was the first king of rome because he killed remus.|`|yw0amT5daa	Romulus & Remus, they were twins who were brought up by bears or wolves (i forget which!)|`|DfRD02n2aa	Romulous and Remus     Romulus (c. 771 BC[1]c. 717 BC) and Remus (c. 771 BCc. 753 BC) are the traditional founders of Rome, appearing in Roman mythology as the twin[2] sons of the priestess Rhea Silvia, fathered by the god of war, Mars. According to the tradition recorded as history by Plutarch and Livy, Romulus served as the first King of Rome.    Romulus slew Remus over a dispute about which one of the two brothers had the support of the local deities to rule the new city and give it his name. The name they gave the city was Rome. Supposedly, Romulus had stood on one hill and Remus another, and a circle of birds flew over Romulus, signifying that he should be king. After founding Rome, Romulus not only created the Roman Legions and the Roman Senate, but also added citizens to his new city by abducting the women of the neighboring Sabine tribes, which resulted in the mixture of the Sabines and Romans into one people. Romulus would become ancient Rome's greatest conqueror, adding large amounts of territory and people to the dominion of Rome.    After his death, Romulus was deified as the god Quirinus, the divine persona of the Roman people. He now is regarded as a mythological figure, and it is supposed that his name is a back-formation from the name Rome, which may ultimately derive from a word for "river". Some scholars, notably Andrea Carandini believe in the historicity of Romulus, in part because of the 1988 discovery of the Murus Romuli on the north slope of the Palatine Hill in Rome.[3]    Romulus and Remus are pre-eminent among the famous feral children in mythology and fiction.    Variations: According to pre-historical sources, the italian Roma were part of the Hroma tribe, originating from Indus valley. Descendants of the two neighbor-kingdoms Hroma and Sint, on opposite sides of the Indus river. The female wolf was their clan symbol, relative to the Asena myths found from Near East to Mongolia. During the first century (c. 70) the twins Romulus and Remus were added to the symbol and the city story|`|WRhOlw11aa	there are 2 "Roman traditions" as to who founded Rome.  One is the story of Romulus and Remus--Romulus ended up killing his brother and founded the city on the banks of the Tiber.    The second story (told in the Aneid by Virgil- a Roman poet) holds that Aeneas, who escaped from Troy as it was being sacked, founded the city after long travels around the Mediteranian.

ISnGWFDzaa	At 754 pages, Breaking Dawn is the longest.  Bella is transformed in Breaking Dawn.  Werewolves fighting skills are designed to kill vampires, so yeah, they really got him.  Edward thought that Bella was dead so he asked the Volturi to kill him but they said no so he was going to reveal himself as a vampire to the humans by stepping into the sunlight, gets all sparkly. The Volturi basically rule the vampire world and try to keep the existance of vampires a secret. So if Edward were to reveal himself, they would kill him anyway, but Alice and Bella get there before he actually does, but still the Volturi interrogate them because Bella knows about vampires and they'd have to make sure that she is going to become one.|`|gx8iF0lfaa	longest of the series is breaking dawn      YES she does get turned but not in the way you would think  yes they did get laurant...the werewolves are enemies to vampires so they definatly would knwo how to kill them.    the volturi are ancient vampires that are more like presidents or king status of the vampire.....if edward exposes the volturi then they can kill edward ...they have very little mercy...but becuase they are some what close families with the cullens they let him slide also they let them slide becuase they figure that the cullens have special powers that the volturi can use some day|`|NbPLf18Zaa	Since the person above answered everything but the last part.    The Volturi are kind of the rule enforcers of the vampire world.  Aro is the leader of the Volturi and also the oldest vampire.  The people that are in the Volturi all have very special powers whether it is the ability to harm someone just thinking about it, ability to read thoughts, and some even have a calming affect on other vampires.  The Volturi try to recruit these "special" vampires to be part of their coven.  They want Edward for instance for his ability to read minds.  They also want Alice for her psychic abilities.  As you get further in the series you also will learn that once Bella is turned she also has a special ability that is tremendously powerful.|`|If2ww2i9aa	breaking dawn is a long freaking long!

Yes, during the birth of Renesmee, Edward has no other choice but to change Bella into a vampire because she is basically dead.    Yes they got Laurent, and they had him so out-numbered that he had no hope of getting away.    Yeah, that part confused me too, but to condense it all down, they mostly just were talking about, since Bella knows about the vampires, she must be changed also, and the Volturi will be checking on her soon to make sure that she is a vampire, and if she is still a human they will kill her.    Sorry to ruin the suspense of the other books for you.|`|b7a146ef697ee51a64d659330e1ba1ebaa	1. Breaking Dawn is the longest book in the series.   2.

None of the Marshall or Fender amps in you range are really any good.    I currently own a Line 6 amp and really like it.  And I always have used a Peavey amp of some kind on stage for gigs.

I love the way you started the book, too.|`|XXc15qzzaa	Hmm, I like how you begin with why we should even be reading the book. That made me smile on the inside. (it takes something really funny to make me smile while reading)  1. I can relate to your main character because I had moved 9 times or so by the time I was a senior but I think you need one more interesting trait about her that makes people think or want to be her or want to stop being like her since they've spent their entire lives as that person. (ah highschool)  2. Write an outline for plot even if you don't know your ending yet. Then only write what pulls the character development or the plot forward. You seem to be doing pretty good with that last bit thus far.  3. Good segue into background. You are a good writer naturally(I don't often say that) but there still is plenty of improvement room.  4. Chapters are rather short, they could be one chapter with bullets separating each section.  5. Never say 'btw'. Parenthesis aren't so great to have either. They mess with flow. you could have just put 'could feel my dog Moxie' which also provides room for brief description if she is to play a role at all in the story. (which if she's not I'd cut her out completely.)  6. As for the plot, please avoid having the main character end up with the guy. Their attraction would realistically be only superficial and it would be silly for him to suddenly have redeeming qualities. Having the friend end up with him would be an interesting twist and the main character could have some major self-evaluation at the end of what it means to care for another person.    I didn't read very closely but these notes should give you a start in the right direction...Good Luck!

jvPToF4Laa	Even our best poets cannot make a living from poetry. There are very few sponsors of creative arts. Every artist, especially poets, also needs a job. Some are teachers, or postal workers, or anything that puts food on the table.    Most of our famous English language poets were either rich to begin with, or had sponsorships to keep them fed.    Also, you'll never know about most current poets. A huge success for a book is 10,000 volumes. Steven King will have a 1,000,000 first printing.

AA11981114	No    The Pearl Harbor attack began with Japanese carrier-based aircraft dropping bombs on the U.S. military base on Oahu on December 7, 1941.    The US Army Air Force B-52 Enola Gay dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, Japan on August 6, 1945.|`|TxRRITveaa	The Enola Gay dropped the first atomic bomb "little boy" on Hiroshima long after Pearl Harbor. Soon afterward a second bomb was dropped on Nagasaki and that ended the second world war.    Pearl Harbor was the first attack on the United States the caused it to enter World War 2. The Japanes feeling boxed in by america, with negotiations failing and knowledge that it could not win a war against the US launched the strike on Pearl Harbor in hopes of delivering a crippling blow to the US Pacific Fleet. While the attack was devastating it only had "awaken a sleeping giant" as Admiral Yamamoto is quoted (incorrectly) as saying.|`|uurgL3oZaa	Th Enola Gay wasn't even built yet when Pearl Harbor was attacked.|`|WvAwQmndaa	the u.s's bombing of NAgasaki and Hiroshima was never forgotten by the Japanese. However, the U.S did many things that JApan didn't agree with. They all lead to the bombing of Pearl Harbor.     Another reason for this is that the U.s had closed trade with japan which angered them.|`|AA11828439	NO! Stay in school.|`|8ekoa6szaa	My goodness, I don't think so.  The Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor is what got the United States into it.  The Enola Gay wasn't used until close to the end of the War when we dropped the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in order to end it.      Don't they teach this stuff in school anymore?  That's where I learned what I know!!!|`|O7w6XGqPaa	You got it backwards. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor started our war with Japan. The atomic bombings finished it. They were payback for Pearl Harbor and everything else the Japanese did in the war.|`|AA11592327	Would a gay bomb only target women?|`|Ps2tufsoaa	Whoa, hold up.  You've got the timeline seriously mixed up there.  The Japanese bombing of the US fleet stationed at Pearl Harbor in December 1941 was the reason the US entered World War II.  We fought the Japanese all across the Pacific, until in 1945, instead of trying to invade Japan, we decided to nuke them.  The atomic bomb dropped from the Enola Gay on Hiroshima was part of the reason Japan surrendered to the US.|`|P02L0DTNaa	You need to be more detailed in your question. 4  The Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor with conventional explosive bombs as a result of the bombing the U.S. entered WW2. The Enola Gay was the bomber that carried the first atomic bomb and dropped it on Hiroshima Japan.|`|MWv5Gds0aa	The japanese attacked pearl harbor near  the beggining of WW II. And Enola Gay was the name of the plane that dropped the nuclear bomb on heroshima

7VpDEkC6aa	Hi There,  There are three possibilities, I guess...  1. Your string heights are too low, so that the string buzzes on a fret.  If that is what it is, you will need to have it looked at by a guitar shop.  Ask your teacher about the buzz next time. He/She should be able to tell right off if it's the guitar or you causing the buzz.    2. You are not pressing down firmly enough. Make sure you have short fingernails on your left hand, and that you can press firmly with the ball of your fingertip.    3. Pressing too close to the fret. Make sure you press directly in the center of the fret. Not towards the top of the fret, like the other guy said.    Hope that  helps|`|R67IhO6Saa	The noise is the string vibrating against the fret.  Make sure your finger tip is close to the fret (just on the headstock side of it), and make sure you're pressing down firmly enough.  Try each note.  If it still buzzes, your guitar may need adjusting.

(That would be Banquo.)     ?Banquo opens the scene at the palace, and in soliloquy (speaking his thoughts aloud while alone) announces his suspicion that Macbeth played dirty to get what the witches prophesied. Short of being horrified by Macbeths act, he takes some time to note that this must mean his part of the prophecy, regarding his royal seed, will also come true.    ?Macbeth, now King, Lady Macbeth, now Queen, and a posse of noblemen all walk in on Banquo. Thus everyone is gathered at the Kings Palace in Forres, with Macbeth wasting no time in donning his new hat.    ?He calls Banquo his chief guest, and requests his presence at a solemn supper that night.

WvAwQmndaa	The legend of Heracles was derived from greek mythology. The romans passed this legend down throughout time. I would imagine the legend dates back to early roman and greek history.|`|DenLZAL1aa	480 BC. Hercules is the Roman name for the mythical Greek hero Heracles, son of Zeus and the mortal Alcmena. Early Roman sources suggest that the imported Greek hero supplanted a mythic Italian shepherd called "Recaranus" or "Garanus", famous for his strength. While adopting much of the Greek Heracles' iconography and mythology as his own, Hercules adopted a number of myths and characteristics that were distinctly Roman.|`|Gox4ol8Zaa	it's an aincent greek legdend. so like, 1000 BC or something|`|WRhOlw11aa	I think the earliest written account of heracles is Homer's Iliad-- written down around 750BCE.

iNXqiDIYaa	Patterson may well have used actual crimes as the basic idea for some of his books but none of them are actually based on actual crimes - all his thrillers are fiction    the only non-fiction book he has published so far is Against Medical Advice - a story about Tourette's syndrome
VCc77ZCoaa	He is influenced by the blues (as evidence by the pattern of the lines that sound like a song).    Whatever he says in each stanza is then undone by the last two lines of each stanza (the sun was like gold, but now it is cold...he was a good boy, but the weary world has changed that, etc.).  This undoing is bad enough that it must negate the good stuff because the last line he wishes he was never born, meaning his life must have been more negative than positive.    Important things you should talk about are dialect, repetition, meter, and symbolism when you analyze.    hope that helps
CwNMq7RTaa	I agree with you 100%.  I've had this thought myself.  Humans are still as greedy and selfish and cruel as they ever were.

Not until you have mastered everything.  Let me give you an example.  Let's say hypothetically you are going to school every year and you learn something new every year.

1e4622c41080edcef755ae0f3f517e48aa	In the old days there were very sharp divides between the two.    A rationalist might go up into his attic, shutter the windows, and DECIDE how the universe was supposed to operate.  He believed that the universe all made sense, so all he had to do was use his reason, figure out how everything should be, and that would have to be right.    Empiricists, on the other hand, were the guys out in the wilderness counting the spots on frogs.  They held almost the opposite view - that the only thing you could really trust was the evidence of your senses.  Things you could pick up and pinch and weigh and then put in an envelope and send to your friends.  The only truth was in measurement, not in definition or sweeping rational claims.    Kant went a long way to bridging the gap.  He argued that there was certain knowledge of our senses that did not come from the senses themselves.  We have reasoned out how our eyes can see and sometimes mis-see things, so we can see an orange blob of paint and know that it could be a mixture of yellow and red.  Both levels are critical, in other words.|`|WVXVeN8Gaa	Rationalists act upon reason. (logic)  Empiricists act upon evidence. (observation)    They're similar in the sense that neither are impulsive, but they approach truth differently. That is, an empiricist "believes what he sees," whether it be via the scientific method or simple observation. A rationalist discerns truth through logic and truisms, or commonsense if you will...|`|w6Lu2Oesaa	rational- the sky is blue because of light  empiricism- how do I know that I really know that the thing that I know to be a sky is a sky and that it is what I know to be blue but how do I know it is blue and not red and it is because of something that I know to be light but how do I know that it is not air.
WvAwQmndaa	Nicholas II ruled from 1894 until his abdication on 15 March 1917. His reign saw Imperial Russia go from being one of the foremost great powers of the world to an economic and military disaster. Critics nicknamed him Bloody Nicholas because of the Khodynka Tragedy, Bloody Sunday, and his largely fatal anti-Semitic pogroms. As Head of State, approved the Russian mobilization of August 1914 which marked the first fatal step into World War I and thus into the demise of the Romanov dynasty.|`|YA36FUf1aa	Is it the Tsar?|`|WxoZrTPlaa	Nicholas Romanov, the Czar|`|AA10670901	tsar nicholas II|`|Ps2tufsoaa	The above are correct, Czar Nicholas II was the ruler of Russia who was executed, along with most of his family.      Side note, the song "Sympathy for the Devil" by the Rolling Stones includes the verse   "I stuck around St. Petersburg,   When I saw it was a time for a change  Killed the czar and his ministers  Anastasia screamed in vain"  Which refers to these events, and implies that they were the devil's work.

tGDOZrUTaa	Your range isn't baritone.    Edith and Kate are mezzo roles. If your school is requiring operetta/opera auditions, perhaps try something from Carmen (comp.by Bizet), Rosina from The Barber of Seville, or Griselda (comp. by Vivaldi). If you can pull it off, Ariadne's Complaint (Lamento d'Arianna) from L'Arianna is a showstopper and unlikely to be chosen by anyone else.    If it's OK with musical roles as well, try Rizzo from Grease ("There are Worse Things I Could Do"), Diana Morales/Val/Cassie from A Chorus Line ("What I Did For Love"/"Dance: 10; Looks: 3" (comedy)/"The Music and the Mirror") respectively. All should be well within your vocal range.
2z1h5mfOaa	I don't know the 15th century meaning of "discover" but I would say that the Renaissance re-discovered many of the ancient Greek, Roman and other knowledge in arts, philosophy, science, architecture, mathematics, etc.  Much knowledge was lost after the fall of the Roman Empire and had been retained by the Ottoman Empire / Byzantium.    Another way of interpreting the question is to look at all the geographical discoveries made at the time.  The Renaissance was about widening horizons, knowledge and skills.  So the discoveries of other worlds was part of it, e.g. Columbus and many other people on behalf of their countries or wherever they could get sponsorship from.    If you need sources, check google on Renaissance, and also on science, politics, arts, discovery of America / Asia / etc.

However, most Chinese in the Philipines are actual mixed blood because they have married many times into the Filipino culture.    Your Nationlaity would be Filipino if your citizenship is from the Phillipines. If you were born and raised in the US your Nationlaity is American Citizenship. People confuse the differnce. Nationality is were you attain citizen rights. Ethnic background is the origins of your cultural heritage.
AA11537248	He always let Popeye eat his spinach and then come back to kick his butt.|`|WhUV9k6Jaa	It's important to know the history of Brutus' family.  Long before Rome had Emperors or was a Republic it was ruled by Kings.  It was Brutus' ancestor who overthrew and assassinated the last King and helped set up the Republic.  When Caesar led a military takeover and began to set himself up as a new King, Brutus felt a higher sense of loyalty to the people of Rome than to his friend.  He joined the assassins for Rome and in this way was honorable; he put the good of the people ahead of personal feelings.|`|DvToP5h7aa	Julius Caesar    Essay.

Sensing that Caesars rising ambition will lead to tyranny over the free Roman people, Brutus feels forced to act, and the rest of the play deals with the consequences of that action.

A sky like that doesn't happen everyday.  If you feel that you have too much light coming in though experiment with bracketing.  Underexpose your shot by one stop, then do another with a 2 stop difference than the meter reads for the shot.|`|2TLXfQKDaa	Yah MH has got it right.  Something else you can also do, is get a Neutral Density filter.  They're often used in conjunction with slow shutter speeds and smaller apertures.  They're basically a white light filter (hence neutral), this allows the slower exposure to look so not entirely blown out.    Many times though you won't need the filter, but it's something to help out overall and make it so you bang your head less.      Oh and something else.  Check out deviantart.com  look up waterfalls and or tides.  You'll be able to see the exif data on the files and see what works with what.  With a lot of them you'll also notice people used the ND filter.  Anywho, happy shooting!|`|b6894d9de78dde6d5fcc264b9258e683aa	Adjust the aperture to create a smaller hole for the light to enter in. A combination of shutter speed, aperture and ISO rating will help adjust for different lighting conditions.|`|uXHnwqxjaa	Set your camera on auto.  Use a low ISO 100.  Set your aperture to 22, 16, 8.   Let the camera take care of the shutter speed.   In a long exposure, remember anything that moves (including clouds) is going to be blurred.   Do trial and error on differ apertures with the camera on auto so you get a near correct exposure.
7VpDEkC6aa	You don't necessarily need to buy an electro acoustic mandolin, although with the  preamp in electro acoustics you could adjust some of the tones.      You can buy a standard mandolin and get an acoustic pickup for it, like they make for guitars or violins. Most of them are like a "contact" mic and pick up the sounds directly from the wood of the instrument.      I had one way back in the early 70's, a very rudimentary type of mic, that I attached to my Classical guitar.  It worked OK, So I'm guessing with today's technology they sound real good nowadays.|`|k0EIC2kaaa	Wintonbreathes is right. Artists almost never record by plugging in an acoustic-electric instrument. The tone that the acoustic pickups output is absolute crap compared to the tone received an outputted by a condenser mic placed a foot in front of the instrument.    Acoustic electric mandolins are pretty handy for live gigs, so it might be worth getting one if he'll use it for this. It's also really easy to put a pickup in an acoustic mandolin later on.|`|T3xVvf3naa	Electro acoustics are designed for live use and compromise the acoustic tone. Their plugged in tone is not much better unless you are spending large amounts of money. Get a regular acoustic which will sound way better when recorded.|`|R8Hm0dFAaa	Recording can be done with either an acoustic or an electro acoustic mandolin (or, for that matter, an electric mandolin). Choosing the right mandolin for your friend probably depends more on the style of music he or she likes to play, and on what kind of recording setup is available.    If your friend has a good quality mike and favors acoustic music, then an acoustic mandolin is probably best. On the other hand, if recording will be done directly into a computer or recording device, an electric or electro acoustic would be best. Bluegrass, newgrass, folk, and country blues players would probably want an acoustic; rock and jazz players might prefer an electric.    If your friend also plays guitar, you might find out what kind of guitar he or she likes to record with, and buy the same type of mandolin. And, as the other folks have pointed out, you can always add a pickup to an acoustic mandolin (while you can't retrofit an electric mandolin to make it acoustic.    Hope this helps

The consciousness of the spirit domination of a human life is presently attended by an increasing exhibition of the characteristics of the Spirit in the life reactions of such a spirit-led mortal, "for the fruits of the spirit are love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, and temperance." Such spirit-guided and divinely illuminated mortals, while they yet tread the lowly paths of toil and in human faithfulness perform the duties of their earthly assignments, have already begun to discern the lights of eternal life as they glimmer on the faraway shores of another world; already have they begun to comprehend the reality of that inspiring and comforting truth, "The kingdom of God is not meat and drink but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit." And throughout every trial and in the presence of every hardship, spirit-born souls are sustained by that hope which transcends all fear because the love of God is shed abroad in all hearts by the presence of the divine Spirit.

LVZdzPmpaa	If you want to publish through conventional means, you do not do that through a website.    There are no sites, despite claims, that draw the attention of agents or publishers, both of whom have far better things to do.    Publishing is a complex and nasty business. There are a number websites and dozens of books that get into the business publishing. It's not easy and it takes a long time, start to finish.    Self-publishing and vanity publishing are different animals altogether. There are also many websites and books about these topics.    Do your research. You're right: this question is asked at least 50 times each day. Do a search here and pull up some of the response.     The best thing to do how is your research.|`|YorMkZYAaa	You're showing me that your biggest issue here is impatience and a lack of commitment to thorough research. You are not and will not be ready for proper publishing if your first thought is self-publishing or how fast you can get it done through a Web site.    I suggest you invest far more time and energy into your manuscript instead of looking for the easiest way. You owe it to yourself and your manuscript to research respectable avenues WITHOUT the thought of being noticed running through your head.     Go buy or borrow a copy of "The Writer's Market" and start putting in some real commitment to your work. A lazy writer is an unpublished writer.

EzxeHsLHaa	You probably mean the old Disney movie and not the new Tinkerbell movie, right?    Well, there is this absolutely cute scene where she tries to find Peters shadow in the nursery and Peter shuts her into the chest of drawers by accident. She gets all tangles up in string and wool.    Then, she is supposed to lead Wendy and the brothers to Neverland, but she flies too fast for them to follow. She wakes up the lost boys and tells them to shoot the Wendy-bird.    When Peter finds Wendy, she hides behind a leaf and turns from green to red, because she gets upset.    Lastly, of course, the scene where she rescues Peter from the poisoned drink.    Oh, and another one is where she gets captured by Hook, cries, is persuaded by him, shows him the way to Peters home by dipping her feet in ink and walking over the map. Finally, he locks her up.      This might be a good inspiration:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3k8nto5S...

VLCF5FRkaa	You have to be careful when getting an Agent, you have to make sure it is a legitimate agency. so i would adivce doing a lot of research, looking at adverts in theatre based magazines, ask reliable people like your drama teacher if you still go to school.    Also the thing you have to know is that wanting to be an actor is only the first step. You dont just magically become an actress or become instantly famous. You have to work hard, train, get experience.  I would advise getting into some local theatre groups, or try and take work shops for acting. If your still at school, be in all the plays.

YbwDFvEaaa	The Fantastically Fantabulous Feats of Fredrick Floomsy      I think you really need to write the book before you worry about a title. Once you know what the story is about, it will be easier to decide what to call it. The title is the last thing you should be worrying about.    Edit: As for the character names, use names that relate to important traits of the characters or what their position is in the book. This is a very common naming tactic that authors use. Shakespeare himself used to use names that were pretty obvious to the character's position in the story...in A Midsummer Night's Dream, he names one character Nick Bottom because, quite frankly, he was a pain in the butt!

A bad fantasy novel I wrote in college (search on the internet and ye shall find) was 'A Thousand Bayonets,' about a journalist in a slightly police-state Baroque-era fantasy world with dubious freedom of the press. The title came from Napoleon's 'Maxims': "Four hostile newspapers are more to be feared than a thousand bayonets." Lots of people do this: Everyone from Faulkner (Sound and Fury: Shakespeare) on to less literary works.    It hadn't been used, was catchy, and worked well as front matter. Just as a note, though, beware the reverse gobbet, where you choose a title and then shoehorn the phrase into your work, in an unnatural fashion. It will never work, and will always alienate the reader.|`|sI3BVNlFaa	What is the general storyline?  Or are you trying to write a story inspired by the title?    Why not have a look at some titles from existing fantasy books to give you ideas.  For example:    The Colour of Magic  A Wrinkle In Time  Neverwhere  The Dark Is Rising  Inkheart  Eyes of the Dragon    The title doesn't have to be long and complicated to catch the readers attention.  Trying too hard to make your title sound 'unusual' might not be the best idea either.    Sometimes it is better to write the story first and think about the title later when you can pick a phrase or central theme to work with.    For name ideas try: http://www.seventhsanctum.com/index-name...|`|BWKDZae7aa	I'm working one right now too and at first I created the title before I wrote the story, but I found myslef changing the titles over, and over again while writing. So write the story then create the title. You can also come up with names to reflect who you are or what you like, for your characters. Another option is the old dictonary flip. Flip through the dictonary and find a random word, then use prefix, or the sound of the word like: Ecstasy could be used to create Ecstasilia (ec-sta-sil-ia). Something like that ya know. Also you can come up with names to reflect the world in which your characters dwell. I'm writing a scifi fantasy aswell, so I also came across these issues. Good Luck!
5DmgmmvTaa	you could try to do something with reflections. have your model looking at a reflective surface: water, a mirror, a shattered mirror, a car hood, etc. try getting unusual angles, and try to include the model and the reflection in the shot.

7VpDEkC6aa	Holding Center Stage means that an actor is doing a good job. Center stage is right up front in the middle of the stage. Some one who is holding it is holding the attention of the audience and performing well.  That he can capture an audience.    A boring actor could not "hold center stage" all by himself.

Meet him in a public place, like a restaurant, or talk to him for a long time, or exchange e-mails.    There are not free background checks; if there were, the sites that charge for background checks would go out of business.    You can use www.zabaserach. You can google him with what is called an exact phrase, but use all forms of his name, one after the other:    "Thomas Alva Edison"  Thomas A Edison"  "Tom Edison" Minnesota  "Edison, Thomas Alva"  etc. Note that you have to use quotation marks. You can add other words.    You can Google "Megan's Law Minnesota" and see if he is a registered sex offender.    If you know someone who works for the right kind of business, like a bank, and they are willing to break the law for you, you could ask them to look up his credit report.    How much is your peace of mind worth? How about your children's safety? If you have any doubts, spring for a background check.|`|hVjxNhJWaa	Ask him questions he should know about you thatr he should know.|`|xItSR9Z7aa	You can try this:    http://everestclimb.ws    Good luck!
MlG1YnqCaa	I think some people in society value their own life too much to put themselves in the shoes of another person, per say the accused. I can't represent society itself but I myself value each individual. Innocent until proven guilty for me because I can at least put myself in another person's shoe.|`|44ujDxwqaa	Life is valued deeply by any single morally upright entity of any society that he will try to go beyond extremes to save an innocent man from indictments by proving he is not guilty .    Likewise, life is valued very much by any single morally upright entity of any society that he is willing to go both extremes to indict a guilty criminal, exclude him from the society so that lives of the rest of the people of the community are safe.     Any life is valued deeply, strongly by upright person and community or society that they are willing to extend  massive monetary means  just  to prove such person is guilty or innocent.|`|LWpUjTHmaa	I agree with David, after all it is humans nature to be self and self caring, nobody will care more about yourself than yourself. The society doesn't value people's lives, they value their own life, they only care about other people because other people contribute to the society. Generally individuals value their own life above all else. However, in some cases people love their love ones so much it become obsession, in this case they do value their love ones life more than themselves. Keep in mind that this is actually extremely rare, regardless of howmany people say they care about their kids, wife, husband, sister, etc, more than themselves, if something were to actually happen most of them would run for their lives instead of caring for others.|`|cP2Ef9Tmaa	guilty untill proven innocent|`|WVXVeN8Gaa	One should only value ones own life. Be wholly, and uncompromisingly selfish.     Society doesn't value human life, it seeks to extinguish it.  I can only value my own life.    And, as for your question:    Society: Innocent until proven guilty, since it always seems to want to take the moral highground.    Individual: I don't think about what is right for others, I only think about what is right for me.
3258fd9ca0baa8e13a1a5449e7bdca00aa	I liked Angels & Demons better.  Both books are good mystery/solve-the-puzzle stories, but in A&D it's easier to follow.  Also, A&D doesn't have so much of the "church conspiracy theory to hide the truth" as the Da Vinci Code did.  Teabing's an interesting character, and Sir Ian McKellan did a nice job playing him in the DVC movie, but he got a little tiresome.<br>  <br>  Also, because the story in A&D is more straightforward and less convoluted, I think it'll make a much better movie than DVC did.

You could say that on that basis the opposite is good, fortunate, and superior.|`|FegAXbgiaa	Here is quite a question my personal thoughts are this.    I dont think evil is related just to religion be it Christianity, Islam or Judaism. My hubby is not a believer but would describe the mother of Baby P as evil. So i should imagine that the word itself would be used to describe the state or condition of a persons heart or soul if you like. A person with out any human morality whatsoever, with no love in their heart and ice in their veins could be described as evil, so the opposite would be someone who has a pure and loving heart.    I do think evil and wicked could be related, i think a person can do a wicked thing in the heat of the moment, realise by their conscience what they have done is wrong and regret it and be remorseful, imo an evil person would delight in the sufferings they inflict, cause or see, have no conscience they have done wrong and most definately not regret or show remorse.    The opposite of evil is good imo, The devil or shaytan is a good example of evil as i should imagine any of the adversary's actions will not be met with  remorse, conscience or repentance by the grief pain or suffering caused.    I do believe everything has an opposite purely for balance in the system of things like ying and yang, bitter and sweet etc.    I hope i answered everything and sorry to ramble : D      ps the word evil can be used for may other things like a regime or government it could go on and on.........|`|AA11366224	The English language comes from a number of roots and we generally have more than one word to describe a particular concept.  One form of the word might be regarded as more extreme or more specialised that the other.    Good can be an adjective or a noun.  As a noun, the opposite of good is evil - evil being the absence of goodness.  As an adjective, the opposite of good can be bad or evil - evil being used to describe lack of moral goodness.|`|zDf186Xyaa	Love, kindness, helpfulness, creativity, generosity, sharing,peace, morals, virtues, manners, all other positive qualities.

We have ability to do good or to do bad deeds. Unlike Angels they are pure and they are full of faith and devotion for Creator.    --------------------------------------...  In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful.     26.   We created man from sounding clay, from mud molded into shape;    27. And the Jinn race, We had created before, from the fire of a scorching wind.   28. Behold! thy Lord said to the angels: "I am about to create man, from sounding clay from mud molded into shape;   29. "When I have fashioned him (in due proportion) and breathed into him of My spirit, fall ye down in obeisance unto him."   30. So the angels prostrated themselves, all of them together:   31. Not so Iblis: he refused to be among those who prostrated themselves.   32. (Allah) said: "O Iblis! what is your reason for not being among those who prostrated themselves?"   33. (Iblis) said: "I am not one to prostrate myself to man, whom Thou didst create from sounding clay, from mud molded into shape."   34. (Allah) said: "Then get thee out from here; for thou art rejected, accursed.   35. "And the Curse shall be on thee till the day of Judgment."   36.

Dictionary definitions show that the antonym, (opposite) of Good is Evil.    Just because we say good or bad, does not mean that we cannot use the same word as an antonymic form of another.

It's more of a mix genre of war, action (and I mean plenty of action), responsibilities, death, romance, friendships.    It should be suitable for you as I read it in grade 9 and I am so glad that my Dad gave it to me as a christmas gift. I was HOOKED for ages.

I would go for Archimedes,a Greek who lived in the city of Syracuse,in Sicily in the 3rd century BC. Mathematician,inventor,philosopher,he came up with solutions to problems presented to him,sometimes in extreme circumstances (for example Archimedes Claw) and by thinking them through himself,not by applying the ideas of others.   Developments by Archimedes still in use today include Archimedes screw,used for pumping water to different levels,and his work on volume and surface area of spheres has not been improved on.|`|VcqRrsUhaa	Albert einstein daaaaaa|`|rfpzdoEwaa	If you want to know who is the smartest man in the world go rent this movie called Radio.

When is your next novel coming out?  Timing is everything    ...so I guess no one knows when it's coming out :(    I've actually read all his novels so I find it curious that he is taking so darn long to write another one.
bdYXd8exaa	She says that she has written a few short stories and a children's book about a monster. She is also writing an encyclopedia of Harry Potter's wizarding world. She says she probably will not write another HP book, but doesn't want to promise anything, because in 10 years she may want to go back to it. She is also now writing another children's book, and she wants to continue doing children's books. She says it is unlikely that she will write anything else in the fantasy genre.    hope this helps =]|`|j6eWCkQLaa	She's probably looking after her kids & doing normal mom stuff.

0LgpcOBDaa	Sometimes a stiff piece of thin plastic wide enuf to slip into the slot will work to tease the end of the tap out. The other way is to acquire a re-loadable cassette (film can) and go into a dark room, pop the old can open and slip the film still on it's spool into the "snap cap" and snap the lil round lid back on. Make sure you leave the tab sticking out.    Now, since you plan on doing this, did you give your film 1/2 the exposure for each frame..? As you shoot again you will now be giving each frame 2x the light and many areas may be over exposed.    Another thing, did you think to - register - a starting point when you re-load the camera..? If not, there is a 100% chance all your frames will over lap and NOT set right on top of each other. The pictures or frames on the neg will not be on top of each other but instead be miss-matched and the areas that separate each frame will now go through the first images, somewhere. Understand what I mean..?    This process is so much easier in either the darkroom or with digital but some very curious and interesting images can be made this way if one follows a few basic rules first.    Good luck    Bob - Tucson|`|7Srd7Pliaa	The best tool for the job is a film retriever.  These things cost like $5, so they are not expensive.  All other methods involve destroying the can.  The film retrievers are a little tricky to use, but they work.    The Canon SLRs (and I suspect Nikon as well) have a special function that lets you leave the tab sticking out when it rewinds.  You may want to consider that.    When you reload a roll of film, the frames won't line up exactly.  I know you're probably doing some experimental art project, but do be aware of that.  Lastly, when you do a double-exposure, you need to compensate each exposure by dropping it one stop.  That way when they are composited together, you have a normal exposure instead of a washed out one.|`|iRXraQWyaa	Don't even bother.  It will impossible to align both images up exactly together now the film is back in the cassette.|`|eNvMKLFsaa	I've done this numerous times..... get another discarded roll of 35mm and wet it - with water.  Squeegee the excess off after letting it soak for 30 sec or so to penetrate the film base.  It'll be kind of sticky.  Insert about 6 inches of this damp ( but not sopping ) leader into the slit ( in subdued light ) while rewinding the spindle on the cart to "suck" the leader in.  Then gently back the spindle up to unwind the film in the can, pushing it against the damp film, then pull the damp film out slowly.  Usually after two or three tries, the leader of your film will stick to the damp film and come out.|`|yWloDrF8aa	The easiest and most accurate way to do double exposure technique is to expose twice on the same frame in the camera without winding the film.   It's highly unlikely that you can wind the film back into the cassette and start again with the expectation that you'll get accurate alignment with the first series of frames that were exposed even if you have marked the film.|`|oXPDFw4daa	If you have already rewound the film, it is too late to try double exposing it. There is no way that you can put the film back into the camera and be assured that the frames for the second set of exposures will exactly overlap the frames in the first set of exposures.    There are two ways to do double exposures.  The first way is to do both exposures at the same time.  That is, do the first exposure, and recock the shutter, and then do the second exposure.  This requires that your camera have the ability to recock the shutter without advancing the film - not all cameras can do that.      If your camera won't allow you to recock the shutter without advancing the film, the technique that is supposed to work is to first rotate the film rewind crank to increase the tension in the film.  Press the rewind button on the base of the camera to release the ratchet that hold the film in place.  Then, while holding the rewind crank stationary to that the film won't move, ratchet the film advance lever forward to recock the shutter.  To be quite honest, I was never able to make this work on any of my cameras.    The other approach begins when you first load the camera.  After you have loaded the film into the camera, but before you close the back, and with the film tensioned on the takeup spool, use a Sharpie or some other pen that will write on plastic to place a mark on the film that matches a recognizable point inside the camera.   Proceed to do your first set of exposures.    Then, rewind the film, being careful to not pull the pigtail back into the cassette.  Then, reload the film into the camera, taking care to match that mark on the film with the corresponding point in the camera.  You will need to make sure that the film is tensioned on the takeup spool - if it is loose, then it is possible for the mark to still be out of register.     Now, if you make the mistake of rewinding the film back into the cassette, not all is lost.  There are three ways to recover from that.  It is possible to purchase metal film lead retrievers - a well equipped camera store will have them.      Another approach that Andy Davidhazy of RIT teaches is to use a scrap of film that you fold in half.  Use a scissors to clip the edge of the film, and then bend back the edge so that the perforation forms a 'tooth'.  Feed this through the felt light trap in the cassette until the tooth fits into the perforation of the film, and then draw the film out.       The third option is to open the cassette using either a darkroom or a changing bag, pull the end of the film out through the light trap, and then reclose the cassette.  Modern cassettes are crimped closed, and aren't designed to be reclosed - so you need to be exceedingly careful with the cassette after you do this so that you don't inadvertently knock the end off the cassette and fog your film.      If you have a commercial film processing lab nearby, they may be able to retrieve the film pigtail for you.  If so, you should make a point of having them process the film as a way of thanking them for the help.

El amor es un estado mental que crece o decrece dependiendo de como se retroalimente ese sentimiento en la relacin de los que componen el ncleo amoroso. La retroalimentacin depende de factores que son ms o menos conocidos, ya sea por el comportamiento de la persona amada, por sus atributos involuntarios o por las necesidades particulares de la persona que ama (deseo sexual, necesidad de compa?a, voluntad inconsciente de ascencin social, aspiracin constante de completitud, etc.).|`|c854f537dff5a2bd15846e6ea01c18b2aa	lo curioso de la pregunta es que insistimos en definir algo que solo se comprende cuando estas dispuesto a vivirlo, a experimentarlo, pues no hay palabras que basten para definir en toda la extensin ese sentimiento???? como se manifiesta??? pues eso tu mismo tienes que descubrirlo, hacer tu propia experiencia porque cada quien lo vive de una forma muy particular... qu si es objetivo??? pues la experiencia del amor tiene que tener cierta dosis de conocimiento de lo que es uno, de lo quiero encontrar en la pareja y las sensaciones que quiero experimentar aunque conforme pasa el tiempo estos criterios van cambiando... y qu si es dogmatico??? pues a menos que estes dispuesto a "amar" sin esperar entender a tu semejante o a ti mismo (que la neta, lo veo dificil pues entonces no sabrias si es amor o algun otro sentimiento como la amistad o la soledad)    ???saludos???|`|873951ca11d7282d5a864dcd8fe4e2f5aa	El amor no es una cosa, el amor es alguien, es Cristo, se manifiesta en cada uno de nosotros, en nuestros actos, en cada accin referida a otra persona, nosotros irradiamos a Dios, irradiamos amor.

Aun no se arriesgan y son muy ascpticas, tal vez no han ledo a Rabelais y se quedaron en la figura de la mujer idealizada del Renacimiento, en la femme fatale o de plano en la estpidez de Alicia in wonderland, o lo que es ahora la supuesta "mujer post-moderna" que ni he tenido la fortuna de encontrar personajes literarios as en libros escritos por mujeres.|`|kWat6yb7aa	yo considero que las mujeres somos mejores ya que nosotras le ponemos sentimientos y nuestras experiencias y sin embarco los hombres son filosofos y no le dan sentimientos como nosotras las mujeres q sufrimos junto al libro que estemos leyendo, lo sentimos como si fuera nuestra historia q estuvieramos escribiendo, le damos vida, emocion, realidad.|`|KsC4ezGIaa	Si bien estoy de acuerdo contigo, pero pienso que aveces depende del tipo de persona que sea.

Personalmente, estoy de acuerdo con algunos de aquellos valores, como no matar, robar y mentir que son bsicos para la coexistencia humana. De todas formas, el bien y el mal solo pueden medirse en la perspectiva del tiempo, asi como lo que en un momento pareci malo puede ser que con los a?os resulte ser algo bueno, y viceversa. Sobre matar, robar y mentir no creo que existan justificaciones de ningun tipo. Nuestra actual cultura de muerte, donde justificamos, como sociedad, matar a a aquellos que fueron malas personas ( Pinochet, Busch, Hussein , etc ) solo nos pone a la altura de ellos.

Esto era bueno para el grupo que no tena el fuego; cuestin de sobrevivir y bienestar para su peque?a comunidad. Pero malo para el grupo opuesto; sufra la muerte de uno o ms de los suyos y la prdida del fuego que deba ser mantenido encendido.     2) Avanzando muy rpidamente.   a) Apareci el Cdigo de Hamurabi (ojo por ojo, diente por diente). Se consideraba bueno porque el da?ado obtena su justicia. Pero era malo porque esto era una excusa para vengarse de alguien por alguna otra causa que no fuera la debida.   b) Para conquistar pueblos y apoderarse de las tierras, se cometan atrocidades, era necesario que del pueblo atacado no quedara ni uno vivo pues ste poda levantarse con fuerza y vengarse. Era bueno que el rey ordenara esto para proteger su reinado. Era justificable porque si el otro reino atacado hubiera venido antes, hubiera hecho lo mismo. Eran tiempos de barbarie.    3) Cuando aparecen las leyes (en Roma)   a) El derecho de uno termina cuando comienza el derecho del otro. Lo malo era no obedecer las leyes. No haba pena de muerte, s crcel, o el destierro a quienes atentaran contra el poder de Roma.  b) Es bueno que hayan leyes pero stas apuntan a la justicia de la mayora y por ende es malo porque siempre va a haber una minora que no ser atendida. Signo de que persiste la discriminacin.  c) Cuando se propagan las ense?anzas de Jess y otros iluminados como Mahoma, etc, el hombre comenz a ser ense?ado que slo el amor y no la justicia por mano propia era lo mejor para la paz humana. Incluso el amor hacia los enemigos; el mejor concepto del bien y el ms elevado. Lo malo es que el mal permanece (hablar de ello).    4) Una mala poltica de los gobernantes.  a) Pueblos se han levantado y han logrado que triunfaran sus ideales. Lo bueno fue sacar al dirigente opresor. Lo malo es que nada es duradero. Lo malo es que hay muchas muertes, familias enteras quedan desamparadas, generando rencor, amargura que no cesa por generaciones debido a la prdida de aquellos que han sido muertos en la lucha por sus ideales; por un mundo mejor.    5) Hoy, no hay mucha diferencia; s hay ms tecnologa, pero las leyes no son aplicadas por los dirigentes, la corrupcin est generalizada.   a) Lo bueno es que ahora es sacada a la luz y puede remediarse usando la ley. Malo es la prdida de la credibilidad.   b) Los derechos humanos no son defendidos; una vctima de violencia mata a su agresor inclinndose a hacer justicia por mano propia. Es el caso de la violencia domstica, fsica y psicolgica. Para muchos esto est mal (aunque por dentro lo justifiquen porque ya se sabe que hay millones de denuncias que estn archivadas en todos los Estados, incluso en la ONU; no se hace justicia a estas vctimas; pero no lo pueden decir porque si se generaliza, la sociedad se volvera un caos); para otros est bien, es en defensa propia. El tema aqu se reduce a que pudo haber sido premeditado; la Ley condenara tal hecho. Frente a esto, la mayora se somete al silencio y un da aparecen muertas por su victimario.    6) La democracia:  a) ?Se equivocan al votar?, o hay que votar lo mejorcito de las pocas opciones malas que hay. O, no se confa que el resultado en las votaciones democrticas hayan sido limpias. Esto genera el levantamiento de la oposicin. Todo ideal es bueno, tanto de un lado como del otro, el problema es que el hombre corrompe esos ideales por intereses propios. Se debera ser lo que se parece adems de parecerse a lo que se es.     7) Segn las distintas culturas:  a) Ser esposo de varias mujeres, casarse con el que le fue impuesto por los padres desde ni?os y no por amor, para esa cultura de Oriente es buena. Es bueno para el varn porque la naturaleza del hombre es tener muchas mujeres. Es bueno para la mujer que se case con ms, porque cuando tiene muchos hijos con su esposo el trabajo la sobrepasa y necesitan ayuda. Ellas mismas le piden que se case con una segunda y as, segn la riqueza del varn, depende la cantidad de mujeres que puede tener. En estas culturas hay una madama que las vigila para que no se peleen entre ellas por algunas diferencias y mantener as el orden y la paz. Por lo menos no son hipcritas.  b) Para los que la Ley condena la bigamia y la infidelidad a la nica esposa que le es permitido tener, es bueno si el varn cumpliera, pero como no cumple por su naturaleza y la sociedad as lo ense?a, miente e igual las tiene, lo que es malo si la esposa se entera. Pues est criada con cuentos del prncipe azul y los celos e incomprensin de esa naturaleza machista, provocan los divorcios con todas las consecuencias sabidas.    8) La ciencia:  a) Los avances en la salud son buenos.  b) Algunos inventos son nefastos para el Planeta Tierra; est en peligro la extincin de la raza humana adems de toda vida animal y vegetal. El materialismo aumenta ms y eso es malo si no se controla. Ya se nos fue de las manos. Por dinero cualquiera inventa cada cosas...    Conclusiones: El mal y el bien estn en cada ser humano. Cada uno tiene la decisin de inclinarse ms hacia un lado o hacia el otro. Nadie es bueno totalmente ni malo totalmente. A menos que no est en sus propios cabales.

H2VpKaW1aa	Concordo con SandroGeo: in un mese questa  la seconda domanda su D. Lynch che trovo su answer...il livello culturale forse si sta alzando.  Egli  indubbiamente un genio visionario, malato e paurosamente introspettivo.  Si merita l'appellativo "europeo" in quanto nei suoi film (soprattutto i primi)  preponderante l' elemento surreale... ed il surrealismo  una corrente pittorica nata in Europa. Un esempio per tutti  film "Eraserhead, la mente che cancella".  C' da considerare inoltre che Lynch si occup anche di pittura, frequent l' accademia di belle arti e comp un lungo viaggio in Europa prima di realizzare il suddetto film.  Per l' elemento surreale e simbolista io sono solito paragonarlo a Luis Bu?uel o ad Alejandro Jodorowsky.  Cmq il mio film preferito di Lynch  il biografico e tenerissimo The Elephant Man del 1980!

yOK32PM9aa	Having favourites is fine - it is natural and adds enjoyment to life.  Favouritism goes further, and refers to the situation where we deal unfairly with persons or situations because they are our personal favourites.  One of the major advantages of our civilisation is that we have the structures and procedures to deal with people impersonally.  People who think that favouritism is OK are probably thinking that they would benefit from being a favourite.  They should also ask themselves how they would feel if they fell foul of someone's preferences and were unfairly disadvantaged.|`|LDLTjNCraa	Well, you don't think it's fair when you are a victim of favouritism. It's a different story if you are the favourite though x). But that's not fair either.|`|KkSW6EViaa	it can sometimes be unfair  but favouritism will always be around    :)|`|fGlGg5EUaa	if you do not know what you like most, probably you do not know who you are too....|`|DMpVSHvXaa	Or not.|`|J9AvKefwaa	Depends on the circumstances and the situation. I think we do have an inborn instinct to "favour" certain things / people. If your mum was one of ten people in a line up and you had to pick one to win something nice you would naturally pick your mum! We all have our own standards and are more likely to favour people / places / situations etc that are in accordance with our own set of morals, beliefs and thoughts.|`|530fc5625af617fef3f442bfdc20f598aa	No, probably not, but as humans its part of life.|`|7i6qj4OXaa	We all have favourites; it's just a natural feeling.  I don't think fairness comes into it.  In my mother's words 'Who ever told you that life was fair?'|`|K5pUbkbkaa	No, that's why it's favouritism.|`|1uIbCMmiaa	Yes.....the others are just going to have to live with the fact that I got the `Best Answer`|`|xq5c1EOlaa	No it is not.

It is in human nature. It is natural for us to find our favourites everywhere. This, however, if we use favouritism to unfairly dismiss someone else, or rendering someone rightfully deserving ineligible for some position, reward or attention then we are misusing our natural ability for the bad of something good.     This I believe is one of our ways to be subjective for our own need to be favoured and adored, for the glory of our own feelings. What we see in our favourites is strictly the mirror image the loveliness of our own being. There therefore is nothing wrong with lavishing our favours upon our favourite people as they are the ones we like most among all the rest, and there is nothing wrong with that either.     The term has negative connotations as the very purpose of its coinage. This is like doing injustice to someone either through undue punishment or undeserving reward. This is simply being unfair. We can keep our favourites by all means, but all those means should be born out of our own pocket. We cannot have what we like or not have whatever we may dislike at the expense of a wider world.     There could also be a positive side to this, as our ability to find favourites I think enables us to find personal friends and even colleagues.|`|tcVm5HWgaa	Unfair|`|wxSO48E3aa	Favouritism is only fair to those it favours.    To the rest is is unfair.

AA11503678	Look at this example:    --------------------------------------...    "Each lung is a highly delicate organ composed of millions of microscopic tunnels ending in tiny sacs (alveoli) encapsulated with a dense capillary (thin artery) network. Oxygen molecules in the atmosphere are inhaled and brought to the sacs, which send oxygen (from within the sac) into the bloodstream, and carbon dioxide is diffused from the bloodstream into the sacs. Although the air we breathe contains a large proportion of nitrogen, it is mainly oxygen that is pulled through the sacs wall, across the thin arterioles microscopic walls, and into the bloodstreams red blood cells. Each oxygen molecule is then complexed and surrounded by a huge molecule of hemoglobin (the oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells). Although these processes take place very quickly, every step occurs with exceptional precision and accuracy.    To reach the trillions of functionally different cells, the red blood cells must be pumped there with a great force. Therefore, all oxygenated red blood cells coming from the lungs are directed immediately to the heart. This masterpiece works continuously from birth until death, pumping fresh blood from the lungs to the tissues, and simultaneously pumps oxygen-deprived blood from the tissues to the lungs.    --------------------------------------...    And admit its perfectness. It is upto your comprehension though.|`|yOK32PM9aa	The most convincing argument against teleology as applied to the entire universe it that no, it does not function pretty well.  Watching the death of innocents and the suffering involved in just staying alive for some beings, I can't help thinking that I would not have designed it that way.|`|4Td1aRWSaa	I think it's a weak argument. For one, it says nothing about either the designer itself or the designer's methods of designing the universe. Is pure luck a "designer"? Should we refer to chance as a "designer"?    Also, the very reason we're even asking this question is that we're alive in the first place, in an existing universe on a planet with oxygen. Most of the planets in the universe are unfit for our kind of lifeforms. Most of the planets in the universe are unfit for any kind of life. We just happen to be the winners in this lottery, just like we were the winners in the sperm wars/race that lead to us being born. That doesn't in any way mean that we were "meant" to win the sperm race and be born or that any "design" lead to us being born. We just happened to be born, whereas billions and billions of other sperms end up dead every day. Equally, our particular species happened to be fit for survival whereas most species that have ever existed have gone extinct.    You see, things are the way they are and people are born. Some people see things being as they are as proof of their particular idea of a Designer. If things were in a totally different way, perhaps we wouldn't exist, whereas purple blobs in a different part of the universe, or in a different universe altogether, would see the perfection of their purple blobiness as proof of a Designer.    No-one knows for sure how or WHY the universe came about (yet, at least). What's for sure is that trying to fit in your particular image of god(s) in the picture leads us nowhere, other than perhaps make you feel a bit better about believing in those fairy tales of yours. It's not an argument and it's not a falsifiable theory.|`|CVqj8J4taa	This is a very tricky argument, but it's horribly flawed.  Let's take an analogy here:    Let's say that you're looking for a taxi cab.  What are the odds that you will be sitting in a very particular taxi cab, lets say  51G34 (assume it exists and it is possible for you to be riding in it)?  That's pretty low odds given the plans of other people possibly riding in it and that the taxi may not get to you before another taxi picks you up.  Now, lets say you're in taxi cab  51G34 right now.  What's the probability now?  100%:  it happened.    The probability that we would exist in a habitat that produces oxygen which is necessary for our survival is 100%: it happened, it's the only way it could have happened.  So you have to be wary of people trying to say "What are the odds??? There must be a God."

Michael Jackson and his brothers and sisters lived in like a 2 or 3 bedroom house before they made it.     Many country western stars, Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton, Johnny Cash came from poverty. What about Elvis, he was poor. How many stars have gone through drug addictions and rehab, etc. before they clean up, if they do.

DvToP5h7aa	Pride and Prejudice - Jane Austen    About Miss Caroline Bingley     We have a theory here at Shmoop that Regina George from Mean Girls took lessons from Miss Bingley. The woman is a complete snob but pretends affection for Jane. She shows her true colors in the letter she sends Jane in Chapter Twenty-One. The letter goes along these lines: "Hi, sweetheart! Oh by the way, the man you love is probably going to marry Georgiana Darcy, whos the sweetest girl EVER  she and I are practically sisters. But I miss you! Love and kisses forever!!"    Although Jane is sometimes fooled by Miss Bingleys fake affection, Elizabeth has always seen through the mask  largely because Caroline has never been very nice to her.

AA10316022	I get the anger and angst of the desertion (perceived or otherwise).  I like your poem perhaps a wee bit wordy and a few spelling mistakes but for all of that I thought that your piece has some wonderful phrases eg: 'I am an owl in the night watch me take light less flight'.    You say this is not your normal style,  so would you be willing to put up another poem of "your normal style" so that we can give you our opinions on that as well.

Once you start getting parts, you'll get more parts - if you're good, of course ^^ Disney Channel tends to use the same actors over and over again, but if you're a good actor and there is an open audition, you should trust your agent to get you an audition. There's no sure proof way of getting on Disney Channel - just act your heart out and hope for the best.|`|Fgn2rfWlaa	i so wish i could answer that question for you. i used to also wanna become a disney star. but sorry i dont kno. maybe they hold tryouts or something...|`|dpKQMoMWaa	okay, i have the answer. i had the opprotunity to audition for casting directors for disney and teen nick etc. but they wanted $500. and my rents didnt wanna use spend that money cuz its SUPER hard to get it. and my friend was an incubator artist for disney, she dropped out b4 it ruined her career. she wants to be a singer/actress. but disney wanted her only to act a certain way, sing certain songs, etc. they will ruin ur future career. if you're looking for a SERIOUS career in acting, then disney may SEEM like a good place to start, but id bak away from that idea. miley cyrus is doing that now and its sad to say that thats a really smart move. shes doing the same thing that hillary duff did years ago. SMART MOVES. so my advice, stay away from disney. stick to teen nick or something like that.|`|S01zIagOaa	Your parents should've started you out when you were 2 or 3 years old. Unfortunately there is no sure and fast way to fame and stardom on Disney and there are thousands of kids whose parents are making the sacrifices to push their kids in the industry. It involves moving to a hub like LA or NY, and being involved in all manner of acting classes. At this point in time an agent isn't going to be able to help or do anything with you.  At least not any reputable agent.     As large and dominant as Disney is, the entertainment industry is larger and the kids (and adults) you see on Disney now just happened to audition for (and book) shows that are on Disney just like they auditioned for shows and films with many other producers and production companies. That is the life of an actor. Full of auditions for almost any and everything with the hopes of breaking through the crush of rejections to the few yes's that advance ones career.
PAWbTYLoaa	Choosing the right designer is vital. Anyone can design a logo, but not everyone can design the right logo.

To make sure the logo is unique, it must contains a special kind of font, and don't similar to any one in your industry.    Make sure that you'll get a CD includes the logo in different formats, if it created using photoshop, ask for the layer version, layers give you the ability to edit it whenevery you want, and ask for a Vector format too, it helps you to use your logo in a large scale size.|`|proLAC6Gaa	well you should deal honestly with the logo design company and build good client relation with them.. well u should check this website i have my personal good experience with this company.
aeda45c3870eccd0f0bdfff4be393659aa	Set your camera on the highest quality and size available. The amount of memory an image takes up depends on both size and color palette but most importantly of all, the pixel density.  The only reliable way of seeing if the resulting image fits the spec is by saving it in the required format and your computer file storage or handy drive will tell you the file size. Tiff files are generally bigger than jpeg or gif files anyway.|`|Xk0SMzxNaa	right click then properties, this should tell you how big the pic is|`|qj1jfaVwaa	Ask the customer if he wants a 8 or 16 bit .tif.    Photoshop displays uncompressed file size. Or just look at the size of the .tif file once saved.     A photo in 8 bit .tif format from a 16.7 megapixel camera like Canons 1DS MK II will have a file size of 50MB.|`|v7Wflu78aa	As a professional photographer, I have found that customers asking for Tiff files don't actually understand the technical end of photography.    When I ask if a jpeg will do, they check with a person who actually knows their stuff, and the answer comes back, "Yes, a jpeg will be fine."    Please make sure you understand the relationship between photo content, file size, and level of compression.  Also, the person who knows best what is needed is the printer, or the designer who works with that printing facility regularly.    However:    1) I take photos of people. These images do not need the sharpness and contrast that an architectural image might need.  Jpeg artifacting might be a problem for images with contrasty, sharp edges. My 16x20 images are sharp enough.  Also, sRGB is good enough to create prints that my clients love.    2) Is it possible that your customer is used to getting poorly created jpegs, and is asking for Tiffs because that increases that chances that an amateur will submit higher quality files?

Go to the Library, o look it up online to see who wrote it.|`|AA11215935	The Book of One Thousand and One Nights (Persian: ???? ?????? Hezr Afsaneh or Hezr wa-Yek Shab, Arabic: ???? ??? ???? ? ????? Kitb 'Alf Layla wa-Layla; also known as The Book of a Thousand Nights and a Night, One Thousand and One Nights, 1001 Arabian Nights, Arabian Nights, The Nightly Entertainments or simply The Nights) is a medieval Middle-Eastern literary epic which tells the story of Scheherazade (Shahrzad in Persian), a Sassanid Queen, who must relate a series of stories to her malevolent husband, King Shahryar, to delay her execution. The stories are told over a period of one thousand and one nights, and every night she ends the story with a suspenseful situation, forcing the King to keep her alive for another day. The individual stories were created over many centuries, by many people and in many styles, and they have become famous in their own right. Notable examples include Aladdin, Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, and The Seven Voyages of Sinbad the Sailor.    SUMMARY:    The story takes place in the Sassanid era and begins with the Persian king Shahryar. The king rules an unnamed island "between India and China" (in modern editions based on Arab transcripts he is king of India and China). When Shahryar discovers his wife plotting with a lover to kill him, he has the pair executed. Believing all women to be likewise unfaithful, he gives his vizier an order to get him a new wife every night (in some versions, every third night). After spending one night with his bride, the king has her executed at dawn. This practice continues for some time, until the vizier's clever daughter Sheherazade ("Scheherazade" in English, or "Shahrastini", a Persian name) forms a plan and volunteers to become Shahrayar's next wife. With the help of her sister Dunyazad, every night after their marriage she spends hours telling him stories, each time stopping at dawn with a cliffhanger, so the king will postpone the execution out of a desire to hear the rest of the tale. In the end, she has given birth to three sons, and the king has been convinced of her faithfulness and revoked his decree.    The tales vary widely; they include historical tales, love stories, tragedies, comedies, poems, burlesques and Muslim religious legends. Some of the famous stories Shahrazad spins in many western translations are Aladdin's Lamp, the Persian Sindbad the Sailor, and the tale of Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves; however Aladdin and Ali Baba were in fact inserted only in the 18th century by Antoine Galland, a French orientalist, who claimed to have heard them in oral form a Maronite story-teller from Aleppo in Syria. Numerous stories depict djinn, magicians, and legendary places, which are often intermingled with real people and geography; the historical caliph Harun al-Rashid is a common protagonist, as are his alleged court poet Abu Nuwas and his vizier, Ja'far al-Barmaki. Sometimes a character in Scheherazade's tale will begin telling other characters a story of his own, and that story may have another one told within it, resulting in a richly layered narrative texture.    On the final (one thousand and first) night Sheherazade presents the King with their three sons and she asks him for a complete pardon. He grants her this and they live in relative satisfaction.
AA11215935	Geoffrey of Villehardouin (in French Geoffroi de Villehardouin) (1160c.1212) was a knight and historian who participated in and chronicled the Fourth Crusade. He was one of the main persons of the Fourth Crusade and his full title was: "Geoffrey of Villehardouin, Marshal of Champagne and of Romania".    He was Marshal of Champagne, and joined the Crusade in 1199 during a tournament held by Count Thibaud III of Champagne. Thibaud named him one of the ambassadors to Venice to procure ships for the voyage, and he helped to elect Boniface of Montferrat as the new leader of the Crusade when Thibaud died.    Although he does not say so specifically in his own account, he probably supported the diversion of the Crusade first to Zara and then to Constantinople. While at Constantinople he also served as an ambassador to Isaac II Angelus, and was in the embassy that demanded that Isaac appoint Alexius IV co-emperor.    After the conquest of the Byzantine Empire in 1204 he served as a military leader, and led the retreat from the Battle of Adrianople in 1205 after Baldwin I was captured. In recognition of his services, Boniface of Montferrat gave to Geoffrey the city of Messinopolis in Thrace.    In 1207 he began to write his chronicle of the Crusade, De la Conqute de Constantinople (On the Conquest of Constantinople). It was in French rather than Latin, making it one of the earliest works of French prose. Villehardouin's account is generally read alongside that of Robert of Clari, a French knight of low station, Nicetas Choniates, a high-ranking Byzantine official and historian who gives an eyewitness account, and Gunther of Pairis, a Cistercian monk who tells the story from the prespective of Abbot Martin who accompanied the Crusaders.    Villehardouin's nephew (also named Geoffrey) Geoffrey I Villehardouin went on to become Prince of Achaea in Morea (the medieval name for the Peloponnesus) in 1209. Villehardouin himself seems to have died shortly afterwards, perhaps in 1212.        The Fourth Crusade (12011204), originally designed to conquer Jerusalem through an invasion of Egypt, instead, in 1204, invaded and conquered the Eastern Orthodox city of Constantinople, capital of the Byzantine Empire. It has been often described as one of the most profitable and disgraceful sacks of a city in history.    Background  After the failure of the Third Crusade, there was little interest in Europe for another crusade against the Muslims. Jerusalem was now controlled by the Ayyubid dynasty, which ruled all of Syria and Egypt, except for the few cities along the coast still controlled by the crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, now centred on Acre. The Third Crusade had also established a kingdom on Cyprus.    Pope Innocent III succeeded to the papacy in 1198, and the preaching of a new crusade became the goal of his pontificate. His call was largely ignored by the European monarchs: the Germans were struggling against Papal power, and England and France were still engaged in warfare against each other. However, due to the preaching of Fulk of Neuilly, a crusading army was finally organized at a tournament held at cry by Count Thibaud of Champagne in 1199. Thibaud was elected leader, but he died in 1200 and was replaced by an Italian count, Boniface of Montferrat. Boniface and the other leaders sent envoys to Venice, Genoa, and other city-states to negotiate a contract for transport to Egypt, the object of their crusade; one of the envoys was the future historian Geoffrey of Villehardouin. Genoa was uninterested but Venice agreed to transport 33,500 crusaders (as well as 4,500 horses), a very ambitious number. This agreement required a full year of preparation on the part of the city of Venice to build numerous ships and train the sailors that would man them, all the while curtailing the city's commercial activities.    The majority of the crusading army that set out from Venice in October 1202 originated from areas within France. It included men from Blois, Champagne, Amiens, Saint-Pol, the Ile-de-France and Burgundy. Several other regions of Europe sent substantial contingents as well, such as Flanders and Montferrat. Other notable groups came from the Holy Roman Empire, including the men under Bishop Martin of Pairis and Bishop Conrad of Halberstadt, together in alliance with the Venetian soldiers and sailors led by the doge Enrico Dandolo.    Attack on Zara  Main article: Siege of Zara    Since there was no binding agreement amongst the crusaders that all should sail from Venice, many chose to sail from other ports, particularly Flanders, Marseilles, and Genoa. By 1201 the bulk of the crusader army was collected at Venice, though with far fewer troops than expected. The Venetians, under their aged and possibly blind Doge, would not let the crusaders leave without paying the full amount agreed to, originally 85,000 silver marks. The crusaders could only pay some 51,000, and that only by reducing themselves to extreme poverty. The Venetians barricaded them on the island of Lido until they could decide what to do with them.    Dandolo and the Venetians succeeded in turning the crusading movement to their own purposes. Dandolo, who made a very public show of joining the crusade during a ceremony in the church of San Marco di Venezia, proposed that the crusaders could pay their debts by attacking the port of Zara in Dalmatia (essentially an independent community which recognized King Emeric of Hungary as a protector, and which was previously ruled by Venice). The Hungarian king was Catholic and had himself agreed to join the crusade (though this was mostly for political reasons, and he had made no actual preparations to leave). Many of the crusaders were opposed to this, and some, including a force led by the elder Simon de Montfort, refused to participate altogether and returned home. While the p

Pasamos la vida recordando sus amarguras y tratando de encontrarle un sentido al caos del cual somos nufragos supervivientes.  Pero descuidamos lo que hacemos en este momento y slo en contadas ocasiones nos atrevemos a imaginar y visualizar lo que ser de nosotros en un futuro cercano.    La imaginacin es la antesala de la realidad.    Pero el futuro se construye desde ahora.    Si tu te lo propones lo logrars. Esa es una forma de conocer el futuro, decidiendo y actuando desde este momento.    Ahora realmente trata de recordar el futuro.    El futuro no necesita de nosotros para que exista.    Porque el presente que vivimos, no necesit de nuestro pasado para que fuese lo que es.    Aun cuando somos el justo reflejo y la proyeccin de un pasado tan carente de sentido donde nuestra f, conocimiento y voluntad han sido puestos a prueba por unos ni?os dolidos de su ignorancia, miedo a la realidad  y poca experiencia en el uso de sus virtudes.    El da que decidas llegar a ser un Hombre y empieces a comportarte como tal, tendrs un presente y empezars a conocer el futuro. Que no es en este momento tan diferente a lo que llamamos presente.    Pero esa toma de conciencia puede empezar a marcar la diferencia y traer el Futuro tan anhelado.    Ese Futuro del que hablan los verdaderos Profetas.    Si crees en el Apocalipsis, generars eso.    Si crees que es posible el cambio, podremos cambiar lo predicho.    Si puedes hacer realidad un sue?o, le estars robando al futuro lo que te pertenece y dando con el ejemplo, lo que la humanidad debe entender.    Pero aprende de los ejemplos anteriores y trata de no fracasar como Hitler, Napolen y tantsimos otros.

I'm not a vocalist, I'm a bassist, drummer and guitarist. But I can scream pretty good, anyway, I started doing it quiet, like you, and worked my way up. I would just do it all day and sing songs with lots of screaming. So the only way I can tell you is by doing that, each day try it a bit louder. And there isn't really anything that will make you better. But it is a good idea to drink something that will help your throat, I would recommend any kind of tea, put milk in it too, it makes it sooth more, well at least I think. But yeah, it doesn't take that long, just don't give up if you puke, it's quite normal. Oh, and I just remembered. If you want to get more stamina for your throat, try pig squeeling.

ip5EWw7uaa	Broadly speaking - democracy. Governance by elected representatives of the people. The idea of universal suffrage however varies greatly over the ancient model.|`|AA10729675	Not enough.  We are totally forgetting the good lessons of great people who came before us, and we think we are better than them.  In other words, no, Greek ideas are neglected and our government has nothing to do with the grandeur of Greek democracy.    However, one must say that Greek democracy was mainly Athens democracy, and what made it work for a while is that it was a small territory:  the city-state of Athens and her colonies (that made a great empire, but the central government and the ideas were in Athens).  How do you do that with a real great space of land, like in Persia for instance?  Or like in the whole of Europe at the time of Charlemagne?  It can have helped in that at least thanks to Athens we know what a democracy was. And we have an idea.  But we cannot have the same democracy as they had.  In Athens even a simple citizen like you and me could go and say what they thought and were listened to.  Here, just try to go to Washington, DC, or to London and say:  I am a citizen and I want to be heard, and you find yourself in a psychiatric ward.|`|18f4aeb76a3e8aee506482a962921d26aa	The idea of democracy?

There only males were allowed to participate, women being very much second class citizens. There were many slaves who had not a say in how things were run. The idea of an elected leader would have been totally alien to them.
e80d865060201c6543892c88a41bba3caa	I am sure you will be able to find someone who will do this but it is not normal and you will pay through the nose if you want the actual copyright.  The normal thing would be to purchase a license to use the shot in different media.  Cost of this would vary greatly depending on what the shoot was for and what the end use was.    You will need to discuss this with the photographer.  If it is for a charity and/or volunteer organisation then you should be able to get a better price if the pictures are going to be widely distributed and the photographer gets advertising out of it.      joelkatz - wrong.

a7c6ee8570b7aa608580bef0382bd952aa	As long as the dwarfs aren't named Sleepy, Sneezy, Doc, Happy, Grumpy, Dopey and Bashful you have nothing to worry about. There is something called public domain, which means they are public property. Snow White is I believe a Brothers Grimm story and the other is Lewis Caroll tale. Check out the original books and go ahead and do your play without any worries. Good luck to you in this matter.|`|uJBnZWtcaa	The Grimm's Snow White and Rose Red is public domain so go ahead.  Disney has rights to the title "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" (because they made up the part about the 7 dwarfs), the animated characters and songs used in its 1930's film version so stay away from things Disney.  You can use the original story and characters as the basis for your play.<br>  <br>  Here's a link to public domain stories:<br>  <a href="http://fpd.iwarp.com/" rel="nofollow">http://fpd.iwarp.com/</a><br>  <br>  Here's another link re how to determine what stories are in the public domain:<br>  <a href="http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=761210" rel="nofollow">http://answers.google.com/answers/thread...</a><br>  <br>  It seems that Lewis Carroll's "Alice's Adventures In Wonderland" is also old enough to be in the public domain so go ahead.  Disney also did Alice (as "Alice In Wonderland")....hhhmmm, are we seeing the cheap side of Disney? ... so once again you can't use Disney's title or any of the animated characters or songs but if it's in the original story (characters, dialogue, plot), it's yours to use.<br>  <br>  Note: Make sure you either use the original titles of the stories or give your plays titles that are not the same titles Disney used.  For a children's play you probably want to create more comtemporary, catchy, short titles.<br>  <br>  Sounds like a neat project.|`|285c8243564acc36040f290206c3ff28aa	It's illegal and it's a terrible lesson for the children.  If you charge money for it, you can be arrested.  Why not write your own play and put it on if you don't want to pay the fees?  Then maybe you can be like J.K. Rowling and become a rich woman!|`|is4hA8eUaa	The story of alice and snow white are public domain. They were published in 1850's<br>  <br>  Disney simply made their own versions, so can you.

7oNpIf4Naa	United States History, story of how the republic developed from colonial beginnings in the 16th century, when the first European explorers arrived, until modern times. As the nation developed, it expanded westward from small settlements along the Atlantic Coast, eventually including all the territory between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans across the middle of the North American continent, as well as two noncontiguous states and a number of territories. At the same time, the population and the economy of the United States grew and changed dramatically. The population diversified as immigrants arrived from all countries of the world. From its beginnings as a remote English colony, the United States has developed the largest economy in the world. Throughout its history, the United States has faced struggles, both within the country—between various ethnic, religious, political, and economic groups—and with other nations. The efforts to deal with and resolve these struggles have shaped the United States of America into the 21st century. <br>  <br>  This is one of seven major articles that together provide a comprehensive discussion of the United States of America. For more information on the United States, please see the other six major articles: United States (Overview), United States (Geography), United States (People), United States (Culture), United States (Economy), and United States (Government). <br>  <br>  II  Early Cultural Interaction  <br>  <br>  Print this section<br>  Early American history began in the collision of European, West African, and Native American peoples in North America. Europeans “discovered” America by accident, then created empires out of the conquest of indigenous peoples and the enslavement of Africans. Yet conquest and enslavement were accompanied by centuries of cultural interaction—interaction that spelled disaster for Africans and Native Americans and triumph for Europeans, to be sure, but interaction that transformed all three peoples in the process. <br>  <br>  A  Native America in 1580 <br>  <br>  The lands and human societies that European explorers called a New World were in fact very old. During the Ice Ages much of the world’s water was bound up in glaciers. Sea level dropped by hundreds of feet, creating a land bridge between Alaska and Siberia. Asians walked across to become the first human inhabitants of the Americas. Precisely when this happened remains unknown, but most scientists believe it occured before 15,000 years ago. When the last glaciers receded about 10,000 years ago (thus ending this first great migration to America), ancestors of the Native Americans filled nearly all of the habitable parts of North and South America. They lived in isolation from the history—and particularly from the diseases—of what became known as the Old World.

SMeyer can't write for her life or come up with decent characters. Her books are sexist and biased. Bella is self absorbed and needs a man to live. That is not how i would spend my life.

S0d1iaSCaa	Mardi Gras Info<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Origins<br>       Having roots in Europe, the day before Ash Wednesday, was one of feasting symbolized by the ritual slaughter of a fatted bull (boeuf gras) —thus, the day became known as Fat Tuesday or, as the French would say, Mardi Gras.  On a calculatedTuesday ranging from Feb. 3 through March 9, Mardi Gras is tied to Easter, which falls on the first Sunday after the full moon that follows the Spring Equinox. <br>       When the French explorer Pierre Le Moyne, Sieur d'lberville explored the Gulf of Mexico in 1699 — upon finding the mouth of the Mississippi River on March 3, he set up camp approximately 60 miles south of what is now New Orleans.  To mark that day, Iberville declared his location as Point du Mardi Gras.  However, it was Mobile, which calls itself the Mother of Mystics, that entertained the first Mardi Gras celebration in 1704.  Nicholas Langlois founded Societe de Saint Louis, a prototype of the secret societies, or krewes, that would later institutionalize Carnival in New Orleans.<br>       The Marquis de Vaudreuil, governor of Louisiana in 1743, assisted by a dancing master called Bebe, established society balls and banquets that eventually became the model for upper-class Carnival soirees of today’s traditions.          <br>  <br>  Info at:  krazo.ureeka.org/mardi_gras_info.htm

ceBTTCPwaa	Jane Eyre is a first-person narrative of the title character, a small, plain-faced, intelligent and honest English orphan. The novel goes through five distinct stages: Jane's childhood at Gateshead, where she is abused by her aunt and cousins; her education at Lowood School, where she acquires friends and role models but also suffers privations; her time as the governess of Thornfield Manor, where she falls in love with her Byronic employer, Edward Rochester; her time with the Rivers family at Marsh's End (or Moor House) and Morton, where her cold clergyman-cousin St John Rivers proposes to her; and her reunion with and marriage to her beloved Rochester at his house of Ferndean. Partly autobiographical, the novel abounds with social criticism and sinister gothic elements.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/Jane_Eyre" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/Jane_Eyre</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/je/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/je/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/janeeyre/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/janeeyre/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitNote/id-23.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/janeeyre/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/janeeyre/index...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmJaneEyre02.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/Titles/janeeyre" rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barrons/janeyre.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/Jane_Eyre_by_Charlotte_Bronte/jane_eyre.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/J...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.awerty.com/jane2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.awerty.com/jane2.html</a>|`|xJoMSkI5aa	I scarcely knew what school was; Bessie sometimes spoke of  ... it as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks, wore backboards, and were expected to be exceedingly genteel and precise; John Reed hated his school, and abused his master: but John Reed’s tastes were no rule for mine, and if Bessie’s accounts of school-discipline (gathered from the young ladies of a family where she had lived before coming to Gateshead) were somewhat appalling, her details of certain accomplishments attained by these same ladies were, I thought, equally attractive. She boasted of beautiful paintings of landscapes and flowers by them executed; of songs they could sing and pieces they could play, of purses they could net, of French books they could translate; till my spirit was moved to emulation as I listened. Besides, school would be a complete change: it implied a long journey, an entire separation from Gateshead, an entrance into a new life. (1.3.70)<br>  <br>  From Shmoop/Jane Eyre/Quotes

Both provide easily accessible lists of reputable agents, editors, and publishers. They also list the worst of the worst in case someone tries to reach out to you so always look at that list as well. Also pick up a copy of writer's digest, writer's market, and literary marketplace from the local library and pluck a few names from there. <br>  <br>  --- In this day and age you'll find plenty of them have websites that give very specific guidelines as to what they are looking for and when. Also plenty of the authors give rave reviews and kudos to their agents, editors, and publishers so look at their websites or inside the book cover where you will find publisher addresses, phone numbers and websites.<br>  --- There are also plenty of conferences to attend where agents hold ten minute sessions for you to pitch your manuscript. Also check out contests, some first and second place prizes are agent reviews or editor judges.<br>  --- Joining groups also help with networking for names and some often have contests and mixers where you can meet publishing reps and agents face to face or invite the agents to come and speak.<br>  --- In some cases you will find that same information on the internet but it isn't always updated in a timely manner. <br>  --- Also writing groups / associations in your genre often have newsletters that provide an up-to-date listing of agents, editors, publishing houses and what they are looking for as well as submission guidelines.<br>  While doing this make sure you format properly, as well as check for grammatical errors, typos, and continuity issues. Those are things you can spot check prior to re-sending out the manuscript. Some editors and agents will chuck a good piece of writing because they can't get through the poor editing. Others will struggle through but will miss the essence of the writing and some of the more patient ones will find the beauty of the story intriguing enough to get through the minor pitfalls. But you still want to make it as clean a copy as possible so that you can make a strong first impression.<br>  They usually want a query letter and a synopsis, so check out writing those as well and again make it as clean as possible since this is their first look at you and your work.|`|RzbRRUOdaa	Hi Busybee!

ceBTTCPwaa	The Sun Also Rises is the first major novel by Ernest Hemingway. Published in 1926, the plot centers on a group of expatriate Americans in Europe during the 1920s. The book's title, selected by Hemingway (at the recommendation of his publisher) is taken from Ecclesiastes 1:5: "The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to his place where he arose." Hemingway's original title for the work was Fiesta, which was used in the British, German and Spanish editions of the novel.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/The_Sun_Also_Rises" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/The_Sun_Also_Ris...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/sar/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/sar/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/sun/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/sun/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitNote/id-178.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmSunAlsoRises02.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/Titles/sun" rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barrons/sunalso.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a>|`|xJoMSkI5aa	Hemingway bore the physical and emotional scars of the war for the rest of his life, just like the troubled characters he created in The Sun Also Rises, and the novel expresses the uncertainty and aimlessness of this "Lost Generation".

eZKFfD76aa	It wasn't so much that the Colonists didn't want to be part of the British Empire.  In fact, most would have been horrified at the idea of breaking away from England when the Revolution first got started.  What they wanted was to be treated as equal to other British citizens.  They wanted to have representation in government, to not be taxed on every little thing and to be allowed to manufacture and trade without the restrictions the British government imposed.  It wasn't until the king showed a lack of understanding of all of these needs that they considered breaking away.  If he had given in on even one or two of their demands there probably wouldn't have been a fight.  It certainly wasn't because they wanted to try an experimental new type of government.  If Washington had been willing we would probably have a constitutional monarchy now.  But he didn't want to be America's new monarch, so we have a republic instead.|`|86cf8078d236374316794f7c3867ec19aa	The main reason for revolting against Britain was that the British Parliament was levying taxes against the colonies without giving them a voice in Parliament. The choice to pursue a different course of government really did not arise until after the war. There were men like Alexander Hamilton that wanted George Washington to take the title of king and wanted for the government to be a monarchy like Britain. Fortunately Washington realized that even he could abuse that power and was the greatest opponent of his being made king.|`|nfUomw3caa	Colonists in America that where subjects to Great Britain had no representation in Great Britain Parliament. They were considered subject to the crown but not really British citizens if they were born in the British colonies. Even George Washington's reason for going to war in the American Revolution was because he had been trying to get a European Command for years and realized eventually That the command position <br>  that he wanted was not coming because he was American born.<br>  <br>  Great Britain also levied taxes in the colonies to help them pay for the money they spent in the French and Indian War. The Colonist probably would not have gone to war for this alone. However, the taxes and the second class citizen with no Parliamentary representation status eventually forced enough Colonist to revolt.|`|AA10303012	The previous two answers are correct.<br>  <br>  When the war started, independence from Britain was not the goal of any colonists.  What they wanted was a more equitable standing within the empire, with a voice in Parliament to represent their concerns and opinions.  Nobody wanted to break free of the British empire, they just wanted a fairer standing within it.|`|3buQDaRDaa	Taxation without representation. King George was taxing the colonies heavily to pay for expenses in the rest of their empire. <br>  <br>  They went for a republican government to avoid the tyranny that a monarchy creates.

Are you safer in surrendering to mystics and discarding the little that you know? Live and act within the limit of your knowledge and keep expanding it to the limit of your life. Redeem your mind from the hockshops of authority. Accept the fact that you are not omniscient, but playing a zombie will not give you omniscience—that your mind is fallible, but becoming mindless will not make you infallible—that an error made on your own is safer than ten truths accepted on faith, because the first leaves you the means to correct it, but the second destroys your capacity to distinguish truth from error."<br>  <br>   Galt’s Speech, For the New Intellectual, 178.

I don't see how that's necessarily indicative of higher brain function. It depends on how someone responds to their faith/how they behave because of it, but sometimes having faith can have negative reactions...like if someone makes themselves completely miserable because they have faith that someone/something will make it better (ie.-forgoing all pleasure in life in order to get into heaven) and they turn out to be wrong...well then they've made themselves miserable for absolutely no reason.  I don't see how theres any higher level of brain function involved in that. It can have positive consequences as well, but I don't think it really has anything to do with higher or lower brain function either way.|`|eezP5wQ2aa	...faith that i believe in you strong and trustworthy...<br>  <br>  ...if you would sacrifice me to the wolves so you could be wealthy for all eternity...<br>  <br>  ...i would lose faith in you and my belief will turn to revenge and your demise...<br>  <br>  ...such is your fate, when i lose faith in you...|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	Blind deference to the alpha male of the pack is holding on to an unexamined assertion.

ceBTTCPwaa	Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus, generally known as Frankenstein, is a novel written by the British author Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley. Shelley started writing Frankenstein when she was 18 and finished when she was 19. The first edition was published anonymously in London in 1818. Shelley's name appears on the second edition, published in 1831. The title of the novel refers to a scientist, Victor Frankenstein, who learns how to create life and creates a being in the likeness of man, but larger than average and more powerful. In popular culture, people have tended to refer to the Creature as "Frankenstein", despite this being the name of the scientist. Frankenstein is infused with some elements of the Gothic novel and the Romantic movement. It was also a warning against the "over-reaching" of modern man and the Industrial Revolution, alluded to in the novel's subtitle, The Modern Prometheus. The story has had an influence across literature and popular culture and spawned a complete genre of horror stories and films. It is often considered the first fully realized science fiction novel.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/Frankenstein" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/Frankenstein</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/frk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/frk/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/frankenste..." rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/frankenste...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/frankenstein/i..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/frankenstein/i...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/F..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/F...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.awerty.com/frankin2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.awerty.com/frankin2.html</a>|`|ac258ba4f1436e3dfef31f6f3ab3f0c8aa	Just started reading this book, and I'm liking it.<br>  <br>  Sorry I couldn't help, though.  :(|`|xJoMSkI5aa	Another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings. Soon after my  ... arrival in the hovel I discovered some papers in the pocket of the dress which I had taken from your laboratory. At first I had neglected them, but now that I was able to decipher the characters in which they were written, I began to study them with diligence. It was your journal of the four months that preceded my creation. You minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress of your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic occurrences. You doubtless recollect these papers. Here they are. Everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed origin; the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances which produced it is set in view; the minutest description of my odious and loathsome person is given, in language which painted your own horrors and rendered mine indelible. I sickened as I read. `Hateful day when I received life!' I exclaimed in agony. `Accursed creator! Why did you form a monster so hideous that even YOU turned from me in disgust? God, in pity, made man beautiful and alluring, after his own image; but my form is a filthy type of yours, more horrid even from the very resemblance. Satan had his companions, fellow devils, to admireand encourage him, but I am solitary and abhorred. (15.8)     <br>  <br>  Thought: The monster learns of his origin through reading. His new knowledge gives him insight into himself, but it also gives him a sense of personal loss that he didn’t have beforehand. Now that he does understand his nature, he realizes the horror of his situation.<br>  <br>  From Shmoop/Frankenstein/Quotes
AA12258086	dont worry about what someone else says about your age..you are who you are..no matter what anyone else thinks. what is the common view or understanding of what a man is? taking care of yourself..especially when you feel doubt..and not caring what the next man thinks. just about taking care of your family and people close to you. if you live in fear or subjection to every little thing, youll drive yourself crazy. just use what you got to take care of what you got to take care of..take it outside..if ya know what i mean.
TAqjyuZbaa	better wealth distribution<br>  and people were satisfied
iLQ87NSUaa	ugh. I agree. <br>  <br>  I mean, it's not even anything more than a trashy romance novel for kids. Really, without the vampire aspect, it has no entertainment value whatsoever. <br>  <br>  If you're going to read about Vampires, read a REAL vampire story. not a poor attempt at a new kind of love story|`|uzCaG1ayaa	Unless you like twilight you wouldn't understand.I think it is because the last book had only just come out and then there was going to be a film about it. So twilight fans saw the tv ad and thought it looked good and told their friends who told their friends etc... Mainly I think it's because it  is popular with teenagers because of the romance and the action. Older women like it because they like Robert Pattinson. Men like it because of the action. Married men like It because they were dragged to see it with their wives and discovered they like it-not that they'd ever admit it. Other than that I don't really know.|`|37E2yPGjaa	I wonder the same thing sometimes :] I think it is the storyline of the book and the conflict. Twilight keeps most readers on edge asking the same questions to themselves- Will Edward kill Bella if they go too far? Will bella bacome a vampire? will she end up with jacob or edward? there may be many reseons to why people are so obsessed... but i think these are the most obvious.

wCdILHl6aa	Sirius was never with Voldemort. Sirius had never left Grimmauld Place, but because throughout the novel Harry and Voldemort had a stronger connection with Harry experiencing/"seeing" some of the things Voldemort was doing without him being aware of it, this lead to Voldemort setting up Harry...Harry needed Oclumency to block not only himself from getting into Voldemort's mind, but vica versa. Harry, being as stubborn, naturally as he is thought that not only did he not need Oclumency (not to mention, quit taking lessons with Snape after the Pensive/Worst Memory incident.), but by sneaking into Voldemort's mind occasionally without him being the wiser(which he was continuously warned by Hermione wasn't such a good idea and Dumbledore obviously had his reasons for why he *needed* Harry to block his mind). Harry thought he could use this information to his advantage, which wasn't entirely true and ended up backfiring against him. Because Harry got into Voldemort's mind and witnessed his attack on Arthur Weasley Arthur's night on patrol in the Department of Mysteries, Harry was such a strong presence in Voldemort's mind, Voldemort not only realized what Harry had been doing but twisted it to his own advantage. He found out that Sirius (as Dumbledore said), was the *only* person that Harry would have gone to the Department of Mysteries to save. Irrationally, wholeheartedly, without a plan, and without thinking. He loved Sirius very deeply (again as Dumbledore said) Sirius loved Harry "Most in the world." Harry had no idea Voldemort had tricked him until he was trapped in the Hall of Prophecies with the Death Eaters (and his friends), then he knew he was foolish and lead astray. This was even more so confirmed when Lucius Malfoy laughed and goaded Harry, by saying "He [the Dark Lord] knew you would come...He always knows" or something to that affect (paraphrasing from memories years past when I read the book last; I don't have the Order of the Phoenix in front of me!). There's the full, complete answer to your question...Ultimately by falling for Voldemort's trick Harry led Sirius to his death...He was also tricked by Kreacher, and so many had a hand in the circumstances, but Sirius was "safe" and once Harry was at the Ministry and Sirius was informed of Harry again being in unnecessary danger, he set out to save his Godson; mistakes were made (again, by many) and his life was taken suddenly/tragically by his cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange.|`|jT1UU1CUaa	He goes off to the Ministry of Magic with his friends to save Sirius, so he believes, but it was a trick; Sirius wasn't there.<br>  <br>  But I agree the book is totally worth reading!|`|iLQ87NSUaa	don't spoil it! read it for yourself

IvF3rdwnaa	If you liked those then I bet you'd like 'Guardian: The Beginning'<br>  <br>  In the year 2017 most of mankind has become complacent and reckless, depending mainly on logic and finite wisdom. Psalmulus Grey, an emotionally scarred, fifteen-year-old participant of this world order, lives within its guidelines until one night when an angel of God appears before him and makes it clear that he is one of the Father’s chosen. Meanwhile a much more sinister plan is unfolding within the city of Neo Creek between Maxwell Steeleworthy, a wealthy capitalist, and Zegudalia, a demonic being from the Abyss. In an epic battle of divined proportions, Psalmulus manifests vast supernatural abilities as he struggles with the decision to fulfill God’s will for his life and become a Guardian of Light or succumb to his own vengeful desires. Many forces from the side of light as well as darkness rise to the occasion to see their goals met as Psalmulus is forced to do battle with humans and demons alike, but most of all--himself. <br>  <br>  Check out the book trailer here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnMR6l5oKfA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnMR6l5oK...</a>|`|wmzzZjMRaa	I recommend any book by Ted Dekker.

Most people connect morality to "conscience" or "common sense".  But conscience and common sense are just feelings so essentially those people just do what they feel like doing.  Do animals do what they feel like doing?  I think so.<br>  <br>  But morality really refers to universal law which we all ought to obey.  That implies a law giver and that can only be God.  Do animals recognize the authority of God?  I don't think so.|`|Run7dyraaa	Do they have feelings? Absolutely. Definitely. Without a doubt. Do they have morals? Don't know about that.

She knows when I'm pissed at her. Do they have souls? Definitely. Each and every little one of them. But most importantly - FEELINGS.<br>  How could anyone say animals don't have feelings? They get depressed, happy, scared, they love you, they are the  most loving little creatures on this earth.|`|frDcAqyWaa	only animals on our team like cats and dogs and bees and parrots.  crocodiles and chimps and neanderthals do not.|`|cdy5uIE5aa	Animals don't have morals.  They can't tell right from wrong or good from bad, all they have is their survival instinct.  This instinct encompasses everything from finding food to passing on their genes.  You can train good behavior into them.  But they don't know what makes the behavior good, they have just been conditioned to act a certain way.  <br>  <br>  Some animals do have a social hierarchy.  Lions for example are led by the alpha male.  This male outlines his territory and protects the pack.  This grants him the privilege of passing on his genes. Another good example are hyenas.  Hyena clans are led by the matriarch (alpha female).  Females are the most dominant, followed by cubs, then males.  The family associated with the matriarch is more dominant than the rest of the families in the clan.  Sometimes the families in the clan shift their allegiance to another female and support her bid to become the alpha female.  It kind of reminds me of the Sopranos or family ruled gangs.<br>  <br>  I don't believe in the "soul."  So no, animals don't have them.<br>  <br>  Animals do have feelings.  That's why dogs whimper, sparrows seem depressed after losing their mate, and it's even been shown that rats laugh.  Yes, there is every indication that animals do posses some kind of emotion.|`|0haWIfVMaa	Check out Renee Descartes Meditations, He talks about how animals cannot have feelings. It will help you out a lot, in a philosophical sense not biological.<br>  <br>  First, the soul is unitary, and unlike many areas of the brain the pineal gland appears to be unitary (microscopic inspection reveals it is formed of two hemispheres). Second, Descartes observed that the pineal gland was located near the ventricles. He believed the animal spirits of the ventricles acted through the nerves to control the body, and that the pineal gland influenced this process. Finally, Descartes incorrectly believed that only humans have pineal glands, just as, in his view, only humans have minds. This led him to the belief that animals cannot feel pain, and Descartes' practice of vivisection (the dissection of live animals) became widely used throughout Europe until the Enlightenment. Cartesian dualism set the agenda for philosophical discussion of the mind-body problem for many years after Descartes' death. The question of how a nonmaterial mind could influence a material body, without invoking supernatural explanations, remains controversial to this day.<br>  <br>  <br>  Now of course remember this is philosophy NOT biology.|`|00390bee0bdfb56e0334bd2845fadd9aaa	no--<br>  while some may have social constructs, that is not the same as social standards.<br>  some have preferences and experience anger,that is different  somewhat, from what humans experience<br>  Much of what is displayed has to do with mating rights,  etc<br>  <br>  Dogs follow the pack leader and pretty much adhere to what is expected by their leader, whether it be human or not|`|1oxBCtmZaa	No.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.livescience.com/animals/071114-eating-young.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.livescience.com/animals/07111...</a>|`|ot8tImmcaa	wow good question. I gotta check back for the responce but i do think they have souls and feelings.<br>  And dogs know the difference between right and wrong|`|dc500182581d351f03c845444a3479f5aa	No animals survive.|`|kOoCya9Oaa	My dog knows it's morally wrong to pee on my leg.|`|jsgKGtdBaa	They have Chuck Norris|`|rlfaVhlxaa	i dont think animals have morals like humans. i would say the closest exception would be the domesticated canine. they know whats right and wrong, but only because theyve been trained. or it could be they view it as a reward or punishment system. they do something wrong and they are punished, do something right or not do something wrong and they are rewarded. i dont see that as morals though.<br>  <br>  other then that, animals rely on instincts. they can have social standards. like there is an alpha male or female in species that have a heirarchial social structure. i watched a show on animal planet called "meerkat manor" that was interesting. sometimes a member would be banished from the colony if they did something wrong like attract a predator, leave the cubs, or fight the alpha male/female and lose. <br>  <br>  do humans have souls? you have to define what a soul is. i personally dont think anything has a soul, but thats just me. i beleive more in the idea of an artichoke... there is not central core just many branches. or you could beleive in the avacoda, there is a strong central core that all decisions are based on (kinda like the sould idea).<br>  <br>  ofcourse they have feelings.|`|lYMx1XZCaa	no.  they can also be sick and twisted too.<br>  <br>  read this report...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nmr.nl/nmr/binary/retrieveFile?instanceid=16&itemid=2574&style=default" rel="nofollow">http://www.nmr.nl/nmr/binary/retrieveFil...</a>|`|n5fZo5njaa	Yes some animals have morals.<br>  <br>  What do you think we are? cyborgs?<br>  humans are mammals, mammals are animals.|`|NFyQWFoGaa	The Christian belief is no.

For sure one could donate a kidney to the other, but that would leave a scar on her back. I believe she could also dontate part of her liver, but not the whole organ-- which I imagine would leave a scar somewheres around the abdomen. <br>  <br>  Hope my sans medical expertise advice is helpful-- at least in getting you started.

If becomes that way in order to seize capital from the bourgeoisie, and forcefully eject the current government, as they do not tend to give up their capital or power peacefully.|`|AA11363680	The glorious people's revolution that led to communist power was a great thing. But any further revolutionary rumblings are crimes against the people and are crushed brutally.|`|g2yUDLygaa	Communists believe that the struggle between classes is a political struggle, and sometimes revolution is necessary to restore what they believe is equality between the classes (in reality it ends up being a government-enforced caste system, with those in the government holding absolute power over every aspect of the lives of the private citizens).
LVZdzPmpaa	I think one of the most interesting topics has to do with Capote's  interest in Perry and Dick. He led the two murderers to believe that he appreciated their struggle and that he was doing everything he could to stay their executions. In fact, Capote struggled. While he may have wanted to help them, the book was on hold until the two were executed. Clearly, Capote had ulterior motives in his close association with Perry and Dick. He suffered over it for the rest of his short life.<br>  <br>  Also, much has been written about Capote's choice of style over substance in the writing of the story. While the murders were of course, heinous, the manner in which the story was written got far more notice than the actual story itself.<br>  <br>  Another topic is "creative non-fiction." While the story is based on true events, it shelves in "fiction" in any bookshop. Capote had to take liberties with certain parts of the story. "In Cold Blood" was one of the first major works of "creative non-fiction."|`|SS9hE8rnaa	As I read the assignment you have posted, it seems to call for you to come up with your own "unique and significant perspective."

Do you at least remember what blog site it was on  (Blogger, LiveJournal, Blurty, etc.)   Because each of them has a user search feature which would narrow it down much better than just doing a Google search.   Next time, make a bookmark.
tOoJL7sYaa	He and his family are taken away on a train and his mother and sister(s?) are killed in a crematory. He and his father are taken to a work camp. He gets little food but both he and his father survive for sometime. His father dies of sickness but he survives until they are liberated by Americans. He remembers his face looking like a skeleton it is so thin. But it is more emotional than that and I cried a lot.|`|JScCYZ8daa	Night begins in 1941, when, the narrator of the story, Elie, is twelve years old. Having grown up in a little town called Sighet in Transylvania, Elie is a studious, deeply religious boy with a loving family consisting of his parents and three sisters. One day, Moshe the Beadle, a Jew from Sighet, deported in 1942, with whom Elie had once studied the cabbala, comes back and warns the town of the impending dangers of the German army. No one listens and years pass by. But by 1944, Germans are already in the town of Sighet and they set up ghettos for the Jews. After a while, the Germans begin the deportation of the Jews to the concentration camp in Auschwitz. <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  The Jews of Sighet are forced into crowded cattle wagons, each car consisting of eighty people. The conditions of the train ride are horrific; they are treated no better than animals. A woman named Madame Schachter starts to go mad. She yells, "Fire! I can see a fire!" (Chapter 2, pg. 22) Periodically, throughout the train ride, she yells about fire, flames, and the furnace. At first, the others try to quiet her. When that does not work, they merely ignore her. When the train arrives at its destination, they are at Birkenau, the reception center for Auschwitz. The air smells of burning flesh. <br>  <br>  At Birkenau, Elie is separated from his mother and sisters. Realizing the importance of being together, Elie and his father lie about their age. As they prepare to enter the camp, they see a ditch where babies are thrown into a burning flame. Elie cannot imagine that this is actually happening. It feels like a nightmare that he can never forget. The male Jews are shaved, showered, and given work clothes. After a long march, they enter Auschwitz, where Elie becomes number A-7713. After a brief stay at Auschwitz, they are moved to a new camp, Buna. <br>  <br>  At Buna, Elie goes through the dehumanizing process of the concentration camps. Both he and his father experience severe beatings at the hand of the kapos (overseers). In one instance, Elie receives twenty-five strokes of the whip from Idek the Kapo for walking in on him while he is with a girl. All the prisoners are overworked and undernourished. Many lose faith in God, including Elie. He witnesses several hangings, one of a boy with an angelic face, and sees him struggle for over thirty minutes fighting for his life. To a stranger's cry of "Where is God now?" Elie answers: "He is hanging here on this gallows...." Chapter 4, pg. 62<br>  <br>  Elie and his father manage to survive through the selection process, where the unfit are condemned to the crematory. Elie suffers from a foot injury that places him in a hospital. After the surgery, the Germans decide to relocate the prisoners because of the advancement of the Russian army. The prisoners begin a long trek in the dead of winter. Many do not make it. Elie and his father support each other through the grueling march. <br>  <br>  The march leads to a train ride where Elie witnesses a boy kill his father for a morsel of bread. Elie is horrified at the very thought, but he realizes that he too has become callous-that he is beginning to care only about his own survival. By the end of the winter trek to Buchenwald, out of a hundred prisoners, only a dozen survive, including Elie and his father.<br>  <br>  Although Elie's father survives the trip, he later falls ill. Elie witnesses the slow deterioration of his father's health and his eventual death. At Buchenweld, the Germans try in desperation to exterminate all the remaining Jews. But by this time, the Germans are close to defeat. Before the Germans can carry out Hitler's plan to exterminate the Jews, there is a successful uprising in the camp by the resistance. On April 11, 1945, American tanks arrive at Buchenweld. As Elie recuperates in a hospital, he looks into a mirror and sees a corpse gaze back at him.<br>  <br>      <br>  Major Characters<br>  Elie (Eliezer): The main character and narrator of the story, Elie is fifteen years old when he is taken to the Nazi concentration camps. Elie and his father support each other throughout their internment. Elie's father dies before the liberation, but Elie becomes a survivor and witness of the death camps. Elie's narrative recounts the horrors of his nightmarish Holocaust experience.<br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  Elie's father (Shlomo): A storeowner and a well-respected Jewish community leader in Sighet before the deportation of the Jews. Elie develops a strong bond with his father as they go through the unforgettable journey through the death camps. He manages to survive the internment until the very end, where he dies of dysentery before the liberation of the camps. <br>  <br>  Moshe the Beadle: A poor Jewish mystic in the town of Sighet who becomes Elie's spiritual mentor and friend. In 1942, Moshe is deported to Poland where he witnesses the mass extermination of the Jews. He manages to escape and goes back to Sighet to warn them of danger. No one listens to him.<br>  <br>  Dr. Mengele: Described as a typical SS officer (a cruel face|`|AB1xk3OBaa	y don't u just go to sparknotes.com.

MIw3GCJyaa	Ancient sailors believed them to be real.  Like most things these days, I try not to disbelieve anything that I haven't seen for myself, understand or theorize about.  A question, 'if a tree falls in a forest and there is no one around to hear it, does it make a noise'?  Just because you didn't hear it, doesn't mean it didn't happen!|`|a172ded814c17e4957eba16acd8888d7aa	I would like to think they are so i'm going to say yes|`|BJERgbM5aa	Mermaids are not real.  They are just an old, old story, which has been repeated and repeated over the years by old seamen.  The theory is that the old sailors saw a sea animal called a manatee.  These animals only have a slight resemblance to our fake picture of a mermaid.  But the manatee was a new creature to the sailors, so they made up the story.  Probably because in those days, sailors were on ship for long periods of time and making up stories was a favorite pastime.  Today, you can see manatee's in Florida.  And you can probably catch a picture of one on the internet.|`|YmtNel5haa	they are as real as vampires, and unicorns and Chewbacca.|`|3buQDaRDaa	Yes.|`|GkH5NoFyaa	I saw them, alive, at Weeki Wachee Springs, Florida.|`|AA11564934	who in the world is telling u that they are real?<br>  <br>  You don't think someone would have found one by now?<br>  <br>  wow|`|frDcAqyWaa	yeah they are really sea cows. sailors would have their way with em and tell people they were beautiful but that was the lie, they were realy just sea cows.|`|73Qzi3vVaa	Everything is real with enough vodka.|`|uIfbWdsvaa	yes, honestly they are real. i cant prove it to you but it is something that i know.|`|n5fZo5njaa	you've been having too much bedtime stories as a child|`|gDuDNeRcaa	they absolutely are!
