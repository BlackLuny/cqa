Non capisce perché il cane non ragiona per astratto. Se lo punisci cogliendolo nel momento in cui la fa associa pipì in casa-punizione. Ma se lo punisci per una cosa che ha fatto, non so, un'ora prima, non può fare questo tipo di associazione e non può imparare. Inoltre tieni conto che la memoria a breve termine dei cani è molto scarsa, dura appena 10-15 minuti. Un consiglio che ti do è di non pulire mai davanti a lui. Anzi, cerca di mostrare completa indifferenza di fronte alle "sorpresine" e pulisci solo dopo aver fatto uscire james dalla stanza.<br>  Detto questo, bisognerebbe individuare il motivo per cui comporta così. Potrebbe avere qualche problema di incontinenza (gli hai fatto fare una visita per vedere se si tratta di questo?), o forse è un dispetto perché vede che te ne vai (anche se non sarebbe un vero e proprio dispetto, ma un modo per sfogare l'ansia che gli dà la tua assenza)....|`|9536f130c829f971cb00912b8dd0c40daa	mah.. e aspetti 8 anni prima di cercare una soluzione?<br>  comunque prima parlane con il veterinario per escludere possibili patologie e poi con un educatore cinofilo per ri-educare il quasi nonnetto a fare pipì dove dovrebbe..<br>  auguri!|`|9uo7w6jhaa	Ciao! <br>  Forse il problema è che si tratta di un maschio?<br>  Io ne ho due a casa ma sono femmine e, a parte quando vogliono farmela pagare per qualche  cosa che le ha offese, di norma sono sempre perfette!<br>  E cmq non credo proprio che non focalizzi il danno che ha fatto! credo in vece che lo sappia ma sia così pigro da non volerlo ammettere!<br>  Sono cani stupendi e ti danno il cuore ma hanno anche un carattere molto testardo.|`|MmugmROraa	Hai pensato che forse è un problema fisico, magari potresti parlare con il tuo veterinario e ti fai spiegare meglio se è un problema di addestramento o fisico del tuo cane.|`|igf9UD6Taa	Anche io ho un cane che si comporta più o meno allo stesso modo,il mio però ha due anni.<br>  So che a un cane le cose gliele devi insegnare durante il primo anno di vita,sennò non le impara mai.<br>  Il problema è che non capisce la gravità di quello che fa,sculaccialo (non sempre logicamente!E nei posto dove non puoi farlo malissimo,magari alzando un pò la voce)così con il mio un pò la situazione è megliorata! :P<br>  Buona Fortuna
wWDAWmBdaa	There is no standard for mixed breeds so it's impossible to predict on either count. It maybe somewhere between both or it may favor one or the other.<br>  <br>  I do hope if you are planning to get one of these dogs it will be coming from a shelter. No responsible breeder would be breeding mixed breed puppies on purpose. Please don;t feed a BYB.|`|1DlAwDT1aa	There is really no way to tell how large a mix breed will be, it could take after the terrier side or the rottie side.  My guess would be that it would be somewhere in between.<br>  <br>  As for the agression, any dog can become agressive without the proper training and socialization.  If by terrier you mean pit bull terrier, I would highly recommend that you make sure the dog is properly trained and socialized. (I would recommend that with any rottie mix but more so if mixed with another dominate breed)  Both of those breeds can make wonderful pets but they both also have a stubborn streak and consistency is the key.  <br>  <br>  I have owned rotties for several years and love them dearly but I would definately recommend any one looking at a rottie or a rottie mix, to read up on the breed and look into puppy classes at an early age
Crl4r6eFaa	It would probably help but I'm not sure that it will. You can just try yelling at him every time he does and and eventually he'll learn he's not allowed to do it.|`|AJijynTfaa	stop rubbing doggy treats on your dogs penis|`|ccd99e69807d9d870bfe6d529e70ab1faa	A rolled up newspaper across the b*tt works miracles!  It won't hurt him, startles them more than anything because it makes a loud noise.  Be sure to say a firm No! at the same time and swat him only ONCE! - Pop across the booty, No!.  <br>  <br>  You have to be vigilante and do it every time you notice him doing this.  When he stops licking to look at you, look away from him, move away(not too far away)  and don't make a big deal about it.  Give him a moment and if he starts up again, repeat the process.  If he stops and moves away, call him to you and praise him very loudly.<br>  <br>  We can't nip or growl at them like they do to each other to show our displeasure at their behaviour so we have to get creative, instead.<br>  <br>  I've owned several males puppies that insisted on humping everything and everyone.  I snuck up behind them, swatted once with the paper, told them No! and they were so surprised, they stopped instantly.  After a couple of times, the problem was solved.

May I suggest starting off small... a bird maybe? Dogs are alot of responsibility and depending on what type you get they can live anywhere from 8-16 yrs old. are you prepared to have that type of responsibility? If you get a puppy they would need to be housebroken they urinate and deficate in your home until you teach them not to. They bite and teeth everything in sight. They also get into things that they arent supposed to.  If you do get an older dog and go to a shelter they need alot of tlc also you dont know there history and what their poor little lives had to endure before you adopted them.Remember that Older dogs require alot of medical attention. I also recommend you call your veterinarian and talk to them about what medical things you will have to do for them. Having a pet is like having a child. <br>  Good luck on your search.|`|IxbGoPBfaa	www.petfinder.com<br>  <br>  Go to your local animal shelter and talk with some volunteers there.

As you have your dog on its leash, tell somebody to open the door(s). Then if your dog tries to make a break for it, say "No." Remember, though, that you have to hold it's leash and keep pulling back while saying "no" at the same time. Don't YANK the leash, though!!! And be firm w/ your dog because it needs a leader when being trained, not a passive owner.<br>  <br>  My dog did that, too, and I did just that, and she no longer runs out!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Zrbtc5dpaa	Wow. My puppy dog does that all the time if we accidentally leave the door open or gate. I think sometimes they just wanna try to play a game with you. Or they need more exercise than they are getting.

Color del cielo, símbolo de alegría del triunfo, del placer por la vida. - <br>  <br>  Gozará de una enorme prosperidad gradas al esfuerzo de otros. - <br>  <br>  El azul es el más profundo e inmaterial de los colores, en el que la mirada se pierde hacia el infinito. La naturaleza lo presenta hecho de transparencias, es decir, de vacíos acumulados: vacío del aire, vacío del océano, es un vacío puro y frío. - <br>  <br>  Pero en un nivel más terrenal y a ras de suelo no sé cree demasiado en la sublimación de los deseos, y en lugar de un superior nivel de espiritualidad, se considera una pérdida, una carencia, una castración; por ello, muchas veces el azul, toma un significado negativo, se convierte en un presagio amenazador. - <br>  <br>  Así pues, ya podemos decir que si el so?ador es de naturaleza espiritual, los sue?os en los que predomina el color azul presagian una mayor apertura hacia lo espiritual, un mayor dominio sobre los sentidos y la próxima consecución de la pureza. - <br>  <br>  Para los más terrenales, los más materialistas, este mismo sue?o representa una amenaza para sus esperanzas, muchas veces enga?osas, y la proximidad de un peligro, que podrá evitar si tiene en cuenta esta advertencia. - <br>   <br>  <br>  Un perro rabioso anuncia mala fortuna y adversarios. Si es amigable y come de su mano, obtendrá ganancias y sus amigos serán sinceros <br>  Para los intérpretes árabes el perro onírico representa un hombre insolente y descarado, capaz de todo acto malo y perverso. Oír ladrar a un perro en el sue?o se?ala un hombre atrevido de mal carácter. - <br>  <br>  Verse mordido por un perro o herido predice un mal que vendrá de un enemigo, equivalente a la importancia de la mordedura o la herida.

DD1oxtxyaa	First clean the area under the bed with a product that will really take the smell away. Then you could try and block access to under the bed. <br>  Right now I think it has become her 'litter box' because it smells like it. <br>  Then see if she'll use the litter box. Maybe you could soak up some of the pee on a paper towel and rub this on the litter or bury it under the litter so she'll get an idea of where to go pee. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps. Im not a professional, just being owned by 3 kitties myself! :)|`|tKNYdDrQaa	Well i would recommend to start showing the cat to use it, for example say it pees under the bed like you said, possible put a litter-box under the bed and maybe it will pee there. If that doesn't work then i would recommend to start making the cat "smell" the pee it left behind, or while the cat is peeing possibly bring the cat to the litter-box while it is still peeing. I hope this helps you!

Getting rid of them though, I don't know the cost.<br>  <br>  If you can not afford it, you can call animal rescue, but I really commend you for taking care of the poor boy.|`|hTTecKcIaa	First do not bring it into your house. Your house will be invested in fleas ticks.<br>  Second If she is really dirty, give her a rinse with your garden hose outside. Then dry him off with a towel. This will at least get rid of some ticks. Next you to need to make a trip to the vet to get some medications for the dog. Ticks/Fleas medicine, Ear mites too. Though, the medications wont come cheap. I am glad that you are taking care of this dog.|`|bf04eda87a4053f72857e70e26cc077faa	its probably going to be alot.  You could call the SPCA.  They might take care of the vet bills for you and let you foster the dog.  Then while fostering it you can ask to adopt it.  Speak to them.|`|AA10739022	There is no way to determine the cost for you. It is based on your area, local costs and of course what is actually wrong with the animal. A puppy plan in California runs about 120.00 and it includes Vet checks. Meds are always more. Good luck|`|w4Ceig5Zaa	get it to the vet immediately rap it tin a  towel out side and get some water and some food make sure to keep it warm but don't bring it inside.|`|Bw18seFqaa	This will help give you an idea of what to expect at first vet visit..  if you plan on keeping this dog, I suggest the heartworm test, preventative, and vaccines.  If you are only trying to provide this dog with some relief until the owner can be found, then just ask for the miticide and flea treatment<br>  <br>  Exam fee about $30<br>  miticide..  $10-15<br>  flea treatment $10-15 for a single dose (you can buy more if you want)<br>  HW test..  $15-30<br>  HW preventative about $4-7 a month  (you can buy single dose, or several doses)<br>  vaccines $10-30<br>  rabies vaccine $5-15<br>  <br>  <br>  Neuter costs..  depends on the size of the dog..  but average is $65-250.|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	Take him to a vet or shelter first, to have him scanned for a microchip, to see if the owner can be located. (Doesn't sound like it by his condition, but you never know.)<br>  <br>  Office visit would be between $25-50.   Call around at different vets in your area & explain this.  They'll be able to give you an estimate for anything he needs.  You might also call your Humane Society--some have low cost vaccine and spay/neuter clinics.  Good luck!
4aAhEK9daa	It depends on which shelter the animals are from.  The cats and kitten don't belong to Petco - they belong to whichever shelter (or shelters) they give space to at their stores.  Adoption fees vary from shelter to shelter and around the country.  Some shelters, like the one I volunteer with, spay and neuter the cats and kittens, test them for FIV and FeLv, deflea them, deworm them, get them up to date on shots and microchip.  For all this we only charge an adoption fee of $100.  This actually costs us about $300.  Other shelters may only spay and neuter the animals so the cost is a bit less.<br>  <br>  The shelter I volunteer with has cats in all the Petco's and PetSmart's in the Puget Sound area by Seattle.  During business hours we have the area manned with volunteers for our shelter.  So you usually deal directly with shelter volunteers, not store personnel.  <br>  <br>  Generally shelters have an application that you fill out and they'll review it with you.  If you have a landlord they'll check with him or her to make sure you are allowed to have pets.  If you have existing pets they also may want to know the name of the vet you use.  They also tend to ask what you think about declawing, whether you intend to keep this cat indoors or out, how many hours it will be left alone, pets you currently have and have had, under what circumstances would you surrender the cat, etc.<br>  <br>  If they approve you for adoption then you would pick whichever cat or kitten you'd like to adopt.  If the shelter is a responsible one then the animal would only go home with you if its already been spayed or neutered, so you maybe have to wait a few days if that hasn't been done.|`|dWed21jUaa	dpends. local shelters bring the animals in to be adopted so it depends on the shelter.|`|b73bda331fdfa778ce67f7c1e95159e5aa	It depends.  PETCO usually doesn't do the actual adoptions; they just provide host space for a local shelter or rescue group.  You need to contact the people actually adopting the cat out; usually their contact information is posted at the store.
6KxBqnstaa	Bird needs to be taken to a wildlife rehabber in your area or a vet that accepts injured wildlife as any bird caught by a cat or dog needs meds as the saliva is toxic to them and they may have puncture wounds. Call vets and see if they will take or if they can give you a rehabber number to call and take to. This is all free for wildlife. Until then put in a makeshift nest (cool whip bowl lined with tissues for warmth). Put the bowl with the bird in it into a box in case it trys to get out. Put a heating pad set on low underneath the outside bottom of the box. Set in on low. Needs to be kept warm. Then these birds don't gape to eat like normal baby birds they are crop fed. Get some kaytee hand feeding formula from pet store with a 1 cc syringe with needle off and mix formula to applesauce like texture and fill syringe. Insert syringe down babies throat and dispense formula slowly. Do this every hour or so. If cannot feed this then can soak cat or dog food in water and mush to applesauce texture and do the same. Do not give water as they can aspirate it and die. Bird this age will not eat on its own yet. Look up some websites on crop feeding these little ones. Pigeon talk is good one. Best chance for survival is to rehabber or vet.. If there is no wounds on bird after warm it up find the nest and try relocating there or near there. Parent birds will hear and answer its cries even though you have touched. This is why cats should be kept in for all wildlife safety as well as cats safety. To many diseases, cars, sadistic people, and dogs to let cats run free outdoors. But personal preference. Try putting a bell on your cats collar to warn birds of a diferent presence. Good luck to you and glad you are helping it.  |`|9d8438febeda9f081685c3c773c13d90aa	If he's breathing really hard, he's probably going to expire soon..There really isn't anything you can do for the little guy accept to leave him alone..Poor little guy.. :-(<br>  And BAD KITTY ! lol|`|dd7de1dd375fcb6afffc282f17c117c6aa	take it to your local wildlife shelter as quickly as possible.  Do not force food or water on it.  |`|W9GFv2VMaa	Well i know how can you incourage it to eat, this is what i done with fledgeling sparrows. baby birds have like a yellow crease at the side of they're mouth and if you put something with a little force against it, it will open and you put food in, do this a few times and it will actually eat. then in a few days it will just open its mouth for food. or you can like use a syringe.<br>  <br>  i fed them bread soaked in water and caterpillars and stuff. im not sure if this would work, the bird might be too young..|`|Mhu0hAUsaa	I do animal management in college, we always get told if a animal is suffering and you are sure it isn't going to survive then you have to put it out of its misery, i know it isn't easy, though iv never had to do it, but it is a part of the law now, if you look up the 5 freedoms of animals, it will say freedom from pain injury and disease, and that is what this comes under, but if you think it will survive, look up what it needs on the internet and nurse the poor bird back to health, though if you do this it wont be able to survive in the wild because it hasn't been taught by its mother. |`|9ifTY0ENaa	The best thing to do is leave the bird for awhile, birds are well-known for being so jumpy that the tiniest amount of stress could kill them. That's why it is so hard to keep birds alive in rehab.<br>  <br>  Keep the bird in a dark, quiet room and phone the RSPCA or another wildlife hospital.|`|0sJsTN83aa	Oh no, I'm so sorry but the bird is going likely going to die...  If it's a featherless chick, the mama won't take him back now because humans have been near it.  If you call your local vet, they may be kind enough to take the bird off of your hands and could probably save it.  There's really nothing else you can do for a chick that small, and there's probably no way to know if the cat did any internal damage to him either - so handing him over to a vet is everyone's best option.|`|O0AfxH9Eaa	I'm afraid there is very little you can do unless you can find the nest it came from. After five hours it must be on its last legs anyway. Once a bird has been traumatised by a cat, there's not much you can do for them, and this one's not even fledged.|`|G7rgqfhVaa	phone the RSPCA they will come out and take it away for you|`|63n8UAGNaa	Take it to a vet or rspca etc....|`|Ed0Rupa8aa	Breathing fast may just be fear. But still thats not good for small animals. It is good that it survived 5 hours, if it survives the night it's a good sign. Just keep it warm and compfy, kep doing what your doing. Try not to interact withit oto much though, that will scare it. Make sure it is warm! put a hot water bottle under the box or put it by a heater..(but not to hot lol) <br>  <br>  Keep it somewhere cat can't get to it obviously. It may not survive because small animals can easily die of shock. But atleast you can keep it compfy and warm. A nicer death than being eaten!  <br>  <br>  Good luck, hope it;s ok!<br>  <br>  P.S. I know how you feel! I found a pigeon on the pavement that couldnt fly because i think a cat had hurt it and pulled it's tail feathers. We brought it home and kept it warm. It died the next day but atleast it was in a calm compfy environment. Nicer than being eaten or hit by a car! Just think that. It is unlikely it will survive but your doing a kind thing :D
Um8osMNuaa	If there is a small amount of blood on the outsides of the poo, then it could be from broken blood vessels around the anus, and as long as your dog appears to be healthy and acting normal then it's nothing to worry about. It can be caused by your dog being a little constipated and having to strain to poo.<br>  If blood is seen persistently or is more than a small amount then you need to see the vet, it can indicate a serious disease, including gastroenteritis and parvo. In this cause you need to see an emergency vet. <br>  If you ring your vet, they should have a number on the answer machine for an emergency vet.|`|8iHbDmHmaa	Blood is never good, I'd call an emergency vet.

0qh8zhYVaa	Your best bet is to pick a few breeds that you're interested in and then fully research them.  Start on the Internet and then talk to owners and breeders of each type.  Some birds have special dietary needs (Solomon Island Eclectus).  Others tend to get aggressive when they reach mating age (Amazons).  Once you figure out what each type of parrot requires, you'll be able to decide what type is the best for your lifestyle and level of commitment. <br>  <br>  That being said, I think Green Cheeked Conures are good first parrots.  They are gentle, friendly, and affectionate--especially if you get one from a reputable breeder.  |`|l9P4CgsRaa	a african greys are the smartest bird in the world they are very very very very very very very very very very very very great talkers and are very great pets trust me but they recuire lots and lots of attention|`|DJa2wS86aa	 quaker parrots are the pour mans Gray ,very strong health wise and a great talker|`|r7I7FoNMaa	They are all intelligent and becoming a good talker is up to YOU, it's teacher.<br>  <br>  That said, a Quaker Parrot is a lovely parrot and not too large or too small.

YnCUyvK7aa	Well, *doing well* could be a matter of opinion.  *Surviving* isn't the same as *thriving*. <br>  <br>  I'm not that surprised that killis showed up.  The name *killie* comes from the Dutch for *ditch* and a number of them live in stagnant ponds and slow moving water in narrow canals and ditches.  Especially those that are annuals.<br>  <br>  Danios can air-breathe if they have to.  For shrimp it could be more of a problem if the water was any depth, but they seem to instinctively turn upside down and run across the underside of the water with their gills beating if the water is low on oxygen.  And a small amount of dissolved oxygen will still be absorbed near the surface of the water, but without a filter or airstone, it doesn't penetrate very far toward the bottom.  So any fish or other aquatic organisms will hang out just under the surface, or madly swim to the top for a gulp of air and back to the bottom.<br>  <br>  So yes, they can *survive*, for a while at least, if need be.  But it's nothing in comparison to keeping them under the conditions they need to really do well.|`|32ed2884882d13680bd2f9e8ee367fc9aa	plastic ones, you can buy them in pet shops<br>  <br>  or dead ones|`|NBfBKI1Uaa	The listed was created not based on their ability to breath oxygen from the air. But rather based on when they are capable of surviving in a bowl. All the fishes listed are very hardy and can tolerated extreme water conditions. <br>  <br>  From that list only Betta, Paradise Gourami are capable of breathing oxygen out the air. <br>  <br>  Neither Goldfish nor danios have labyrinth which allow them to breath oxygen from the air.<br>  <br>  <br>  Second if you look at that news article, it is an very old article reprinted in 2004. Many of the aquarium practices have changed since and it is out of date.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  -rds|`|oMmBhWK4aa	The facts are that only anabantoids, fish with the special labyrinth organ, can breathe atmospheric air directly, in addition of the usual breathing through the gills. Such fish include the betta, gourami, paradise fish and less common relatives like climbing perch, ctenopoma, bushfish, combtail, snakehead, badis, leaf fish, nandus. It's likely that being an anabantoid allowed the paradise fish to survive the journey to become the 1st tropical fish imported into Europe in 1869.<br>  <br>  Goldfish are the all-time mistake for bowls, which is why the darned things are commonly called goldfish bowls. Goldies simply grow too big, poop too much and as a coldwater fish need more oxygen, with all these factors it's not a surprise many die in bowls. And they are certainly not fish for novices.<br>  <br>  When the water becomes oxygen deprived, any fish would be gasping for air at the surface but only the anabantoids have any degree of effectiveness in this. If the situation persists or if even the anabantoids are prevented from breathing atmospheric air (no gap between water & tank cover), all the fish will soon be dead.<br>  <br>  The plain fact is that bowls and other mini containers are not at all suitable for fish keeping. Such "tanks" are also more prone to temperature instability, if the water heats up too much it'll hold less oxygen. Barely surviving for a limited time is as different from "doing well" as day is from night. Novices learn the hard way, with their fish sacrificed needlessly, that it's very difficult to maintain small tanks due to the much smaller margin for errors in water quality. They think that as long as the fish isn't dead yet, it's ok. Well they should try living in the broom closet, eating & pooping in there too.<br>  <br>  As for shrimps, I understand that they process oxygen differently from fish, so a lower oxygen level which might discomfort fish doesn't have the same effect on shrimps. But almost all freshwater shrimps are very particular about water quality, which leads to the same conclusion that bowls should not be used as an "aquarium".|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	If Goldfish gulp air they get digestive disorders, it's definitely NOT good for them! <br>  <br>  The only fish that can gulp air without getting damage are the few fish in the labryinth family and also Corydoras - they have developed the ability to filter oxygen through their digestive system. But fish ONLY would use this in desperate situations. <br>  <br>  The other fish they mention simple got the reputation for being a bit tougher than others. It doesn't mean it's right to keep them in unfiltered environments. The livebearers in that list for instance got a reputation for surviving in bowls with plants, but only surviving, not thriving.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	All of those fish listed really should have a filter and heater in a tank size of AT LEAST 5 gallons. I'm appalled at the idea of information such as that being on the internet. Even goldfish don't do well in bowls because they do get really big. Unless you have a 55gallon bowl, don't try goldfish. The only fish that do OK in a bowl are bettas (though it's not the best idea).

jyGTlpzTaa	Beautiful dogs, very dominant and thus they need owners with a lot of dog training experience if they are to become well socialised adults. They are one of those breeds that is like a loaded gun in the hands of the wrong people, but a pussycat in the hands of the right people. Bear in mind such a dog will be expensive to buy, very expensive to feed and might require socialisation classes. They are also short lived, like a lot of big dogs, 7-9 years is the average, they are prone to a lot of health difficulties and many spend half their lifetimes in the vets. They need extra care because of their wrinkly faces and are very drooly dogs. <br>  <br>  On the other hand they are loyal and excellent guard dogs, very handsome and loving if properly trained.
4a0ec74f608f9feb41aa65e6c4aec084aa	Not really sure except it might kill them because the "jumping" is caused by a worm in the bean and the cold might just kill them because they come from a hot climate.......|`|AA11375499	probably not, there is a worm inside (what teh first guy said) from mexico that is naturally accustomed to a very warm climate, you should probably just let them be|`|0c2f19d2258cfc5f322b1212f2c02e22aa	Absolutely not.

Im afraid it will either be the dog or the cat, I am personally a cat person but I would get rid of your dog. If your dog keeps on attacking your cat like this your cat WILL be killed. Also it might be an idea to get rid of the dog because if you get rid of the cat your dog may find other cats to attack and kill and I don't think your neighbors would be too pleased about that. It isn't really a good to have a dog with a cat unless the dog is really laid back and the cat wouldn't mind it sitting around. Its best if you want a dog and a cat that you should get a kitten and a puppy so they could grow up together. You might want to try and get another dog that is more laid back and won't mind having a cat around the house. Maybe you should check your local shelter because there will be some really sweet dogs there just waiting for a home.
ld2vmypNaa	I like my cichlids, but they get to be 8".<br>  <br>  But in a 24 gallons you would need a community tank.<br>  Guppies, platties,swords, marbled mollies, neon's..<br>  They say one fish per gallon.

THEY ARE VERY PEACEFUL.<br>  <br>  Freshwater pipefish - sucks prey into opened mouth, requires addition of salt, best kept in a species only tank.
YmLezz03aa	try a different litter, maybe get some wooden scratching post or just a 16 inch square piece a plywood for him to scratch, maybe he just likes the smell of wooden steps, good luck|`|AA12237300	i would say try cleaning the litter box, if you dont already, everyday to keep it clean. you say he does it every couple days, maybe thats his way of telling you that his litter box needs to be scooped. and a lot of times animals will do things like poop or puke in areas that their owners go through a lot so its not missed. i think thats their way of saying "mommy i dont feel good, so here you go, you dont have to go find it"<br>  I would try scooping the litterbox more often or change the type of  litter you use, maybe hes picky. a lot of cats are. i know mine are.

yzvuiswtaa	hey there, <br>  <br>  i would wait till the babies are at least 2 weeks old to remove them from the parents, because if u remove them the male would want to breed with the mum again and she wont be physically ready to have more babies so the male would just keep harrassing her and bullying her cause he wants to have more. the female will start to discolour and its fins might get nipped and stuff.<br>  <br>  if this does happen, she might die, but if she doesnt she will be ready to have another batch in a few weeks time.<br>  <br>  ive had this problem before with my very first load of babies and yea the females tail just all got bitten of her and she lost most of her colour :(.<br>  <br>  You dont HAVE to remove the babies if you dont want to, they will survive better and even grow much faster when kept with the parents. i have tested this myself.<br>  <br>  The fry tank that i have is just a 2 foot long tank with a few elodea, a snail (not necessary) anda  baby saving sponge filter.<br>  |`|xiZlxjPQaa	you can do whatever you like|`|73jaeHdLaa	I'm not sure, but from my experience they had a lot of babies, and the children cannibalized the parents and each other.
FGxrXLGBaa	Dogs are allergic to certain types of nail varnish,because of it chemical make upand smell.<br>  Beware it could drive him crazy enough to ATTACK you.|`|NNiN0tK0aa	Is this a joke posting?  If you really do try to braid your pitbulls hair, and this makes him bite you, then yes he would certainly bite you if you tried to paint his toenails.  My two female dogs are very gentle, timid and wimpy and as they were rescued from neglect are both desparate for attention.  They would do anything for attention - even let me paint their toenails, not that I would do such a thing.  When my mother was 3 she painted her black labrador completely white with gloss paint.  The poor thing just stood there and let her.  Labradors are usually saintly.  Most labradors and newfoundlands would let someone paint their toenails but a pitbull?  No way.  If you want a dog you can braid the hair of, dye the hair of, style the hair of and paint the toenails of, get a poodle or a lhasa apso.  However I find it hard to believe anyone would really do those things to a pitbull.  Pitbulls are banned in the UK under the Dangerous Dogs Act, and are also banned in many other countries, and in many counties of the USA.  If your pitbull had ever bitten you properly you wouldnt be asking this questions.|`|SRmNJCdiaa	As a groomer I had many people request that we paint their dogs claws.  Its a stupid idea.  The majority of dogs do not like having their feet touched so why put them through the stress of touching their feet that much just so you can think is "toenails" are cute.  <br>  <br>  If your dog doesn't mind it and you use nail polish made for dogs (it peels off so you don't have to use nail polish remover) then go ahead and try.  But vicious or not, it isn't going to be easy and if you get bitten, will it really have been worth it to stress your dog out?|`|LiXyrQ9waa	Are you kiddin' me? Why would you do that to your dog? Maybe all of what you're doing to him actually MADE HIM be vicious!<br>  <br>  <br>  SO, i think he will bite you, sorry.|`|rVUCTz3Taa	Its depends on what kind of personality your dog has,, its hard to tell since i dont personallly kno your dog but since you said he's really vicous and bites he probably will bite...

How long has this been going on???<br>  |`|Cfk1kr8Daa	 Get her to the emergency vet NOW - please!
L3zVsBp1aa	Definitely sounds like a urinary tract infection.  My cat had the same problem about a year ago.  Go to the vet tomorrow and they'll be able to verify if it is or not.  For now, confine her to an enclosed room (preferably one with a tile or concrete floor) until your vet appointment tomorrow.  That way her pee will be easier to clean up and you'll know it's only in that one room.|`|OKiMkaxGaa	Sounds like a urinary tract infection-normally treated with antibiotics- though call your emergency vet and get their advice incase it is more serious.|`|f3IdjgiEaa	Finding pee around your house seems to be more of an issue than the fact that the UTI could possibly kill it.  I would be searching for another vet if it hadn't cleared up yet.  <br>  <br>  They pee all over the house because it HURTS.  They are peeing blood which means the infection is really bad.<br>  <br>  I would call a 24 hour vet and get her in.

Pg6I1Tbzaa	*sigh*there is so much things to say about how your dog is living, but Im not going to say it...<br>  one thing though, a dog shouldnt be living outside all the time...|`|gwUMipsUaa	MAKE her come in the house when you can't be outside to supervise her.|`|oGVWdnHraa	If youre not willing to keep you dog inside, you probably shouldnt have one......you cant expect a dog to stay outside all its life without getting bored and wanting to explore|`|RkqgE30Vaa	Well i Dont know but you can ask the vet or some prof dog trainer or whisperer. |`|7mHlDzn9aa	 Those collars do not work if they are loose or if the dogs fur obstructs the contacts. I do not really agree with using them.. Perhaps a pony stake and a chain to tether your pup would work better untill you can get the dog to settle down. Young dogs are just like children as as they dont settle down and be the buddy you want untill at least 3 years old. In the meantime training and attention will make your dog your best friend with time.  |`|rMzEt909aa	It sounds like your dog might be leaving the yard for several reasons.  First of all, lack of exercise and human companionship.  Dogs are pack animals and as such, are not meant to live alone all the time.  <br>  Actually though, I'm not sure why you don't take her for walks everyday, and that way she would get her exercise and would be spending time with the humans she loves; and would be more content to stay in the yard. I would certainly give this a try before investing more money for fencing, etc.It sounds to me like this dog is very neglected by you and your family, even if she is getting fed and watered...she is being neglected. That being said,  have you considered putting up a large chain link kennel outside for her? <br>  That way she won't get out, but will still have some room to run and jump.  Sometimes those electric fences just aren't what they're cracked up to be; especially if it is a cheap set.  My daughter had one around her yard and had 3 large dogs and none of them ever crossed the electric fence; so even though she paid a high price for the collar/fence set, it has paid for itself many times over.  If your physical fence isn't very high, it's quite possible your dog is simply jumping over it, and maybe there is something she is able to get up on and thereby jump over it easier. Have you never taken the time to stand at a window and watch how she is escaping?  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|tMt1nIMiaa	WHY would you turn up an electric line to the max! Maybe that's why she runs off because if she runs free and doesn't come back she wouldn't have to deal with electric shocks!  Did you ever try to tie her up instead.  Lots of people around my area tie their dogs up. |`|VqpDp1Xpaa	put it in a cage

Good luck and I hope everything turns out O.K. for him.  |`|jkoU23vPaa	Get him to the vet ASAP.  That is very characteristic of foreign body blockage in the bowel/stomach and this is a case where you would rather be safe than sorry.  If that truly is the cause the sooner it is caught and treated the better the outcome.|`|cCEMGEdmaa	i dont know why it is that color maybe he ate too much grass or something keep a close watch over him and if he continues to throw up bring him to the vet to see wat the problem is|`|PPbdfSLJaa	rush him to the vet.. or has he consumed some foreign objects like metal, parts of his toys..... it could have poked his intestines and stomach.. thus causing him to puke..|`|zTpgIld0aa	it ate something bad that it isn't used too

IuYekkPVaa	You need to have nerves of steel and ignore his demands.  If you give in every time, he'll think that yowling is an effective method and will continue to do it whenever he wants to go out at night.  <br>  <br>  My two cats are not allowed outside when it gets dark, but the male used to sit by the door and yowl in the hope that I would open it.  I noticed that his vocalisation went in 3 phases.  At first it would be short meows, then more pitiful tones and then indignant caterwauling.  He would also keep looking over at me as if to say "Didn't you hear me?".  I just avoided eye contact and ignored him until eventually he realised that he wasn't going to get his way and then he would go upstairs to bed in a sulk (lol).<br>  <br>  Be patient, it will probably take at least 2-3 weeks for him to understand that yowling is no longer an effective method of getting you to let him out.|`|a08xszn3aa	Ohh man i kno exactly what you mean wen they wanna be fed you cant stop them they wanna go out you cant stop them they are very demanding animals that always seem to get there own way.<br>  I just ignore our cats when they want to get out.<br>  And am in the prosess of trying to train my young kitten to be an indoor cat.<br>  Wish me luck.|`|AA10038780	if you don't want him out at night, then you can't EVER let him out.<br>  Now he thinks enough yowling will get him out...because that is what<br>  has occured.<br>  <br>  Is there a room you can close him in to mute his sound?  <br>  Several weeks of him not getting out at night, will start to turn this <br>  behavior around, assuming you live in the city where there are no<br>  interesting creatures for him to yowl at|`|uDZZLH0Uaa	let him prowl that's what cats do and sense you didn't train him to be an indoor cat totally he loves to be out side. hes a cat let him out. he will be find. if your worried about him hunting other animals or other animals going after him pit a bell around his neck and the noise will scare off all predators as well as other cats.and you will hear where he might be in the dark too. <br>  my daughters boyfriend does this and his cat stays out side all the time and never has any problems. <br>  <br>  my cats are in door cats and have never been out side so they don't miss what they have never done...

zv8QaMe1aa	There are a variety of reasons why a cat may be bottle fed, rather than nursed by their mother..... if the kitten is less than perfect, sometimes the mother will reject them to focus on the healthier kittens and give them the better chance of survival.. so humans can try to bottle feed and save the kitten.  If the mother is ill with something contagious, bottle feeding is often done to prevent the kittens catching what the mother has.  In some instances a mother cat has more kittens than she can supply milk for, so supplemental feeding with a bottle can be done.  Their mother's milk is the best option when that is feasible, but bottle feeding can be a decent substitute (even though a lot of work for the humans, newborn kittens need feeding OFTEN).<br>  <br>  I hope this information helps.|`|6LF1b4Dhaa	Do you mean if it's offered to them?  I think if you offered a kitten replacement milk then that's a lot easier than competing with the other kittens for milk, hence the preference.  Have a good day:)

AA11334957	Blowing a fan on your hamster won't work. What makes humans feel cooler when the fan is blowing is actually just the evaporation of sweat on the skin surface. Hamsters don't sweat, so they don't get this effect and your just blowing hot air on your hammie. Do you have a piece of rock, like slate, or a bag of gravel like from the aquarium store? Maybe get several and put them in the freezer. Once they are cold wrap a dish towel around them and put them in your hammies cage.  They can lay on it  without getting wet like they would from the frozen water bottle and you don't run the risk of your hamster chewing on the bottle's plastic. <br>  I have a piece of marble that I found at a home improvement store. It used to be part of a counter top, but it got busted, so they were going to throw it out and they let me have it for free. <br>  Any type of flat rock like that will work. Change the rock frequently to keep you hammie cool.<br>  Hamster are originally desert animals and won't get overheated too  quickly, but 90* is a bit much. Make sure the cage they're in is well ventilated too.<br>  Good luck and I hope you guys get a break in the weather real soon.|`|AA11518253	If you live in a house, take them to the basement.  It's a lot cooler than the rest of the house.  Just make sure to go down there and take care of them.<br>  <br>  If you don't have a basement or air conditioning, could you take them to a friend's house until it cools off?<br>  <br>  I don't know about the ice bottle - they're pretty little, and you don't want them to get TOO cold...<br>  <br>  Good luck - it finally cooled off here.  Our hamster is happy to be back out of the basement and into his room.|`|57e724e00481329013410be948e50a4aaa	lol!wow!It's hot here too.do u have a basement?basements are good cause they are cooler.I don't know about the ice bottle thing but basements are good!|`|e1bc9ee12a586a97194ed85c52656355aa	I had the same problem when i had dwarf hampsters. I live in SW Florida, and have 2 mice. I have a/c, but when its turned off, i make sure i have a fan blowing some what in the cages. At any store really, they sell tiny little low speed fans, I use those and place them above the cages. I don't have them blowing in directly, they don;t like constant breeze, but if its high enough but close enough to the cage, it'll give them a slight breeze.  Thats what I do anyways! An icebottle might be to much for them considering their size. Maybe crush some ice and put it in the water bottle so at least their water is really cold to.<br>  Good luck this heats brutal!
c8e43af2391a726af1b17f5333e2c92daa	Let's keep it Australian.  Most moderately- sized and small Aussie birds are more "aviary birds" as opposed to companion birds (excluding of course the lories).  These arid-climate species are gentle, and I think something like a Mulga parrot would be nice.  I have 2 bourke's parrakeets (companions for my grey, actually).  They have been kept as aviary birds but if you were to get younger ones they could be tamed into very quiet, gentle pets.  Hmm...let me think some more about birds of this type...I'll be right back so hold on...<br>  <br>  Ok, as far as moderately-sized Aussie birds are concerned I came up with Hooded Parrot,  red-rumped parrot,  golden-shouldered parrot.  Of course there are various rosella species to choose from.  I know rosellas (again) prefer life as aviary birds but then I have a friend with the friendliest crimson rosella you ever could hope to meet so go figure?  There are smaller species you can look into belonging to the neophema group.  I have had scarlet-chested parrakeets.  They are stunningly beautiful and very quiet,  gentle aviary birds (belonging to the neophema genus).  Bourke's used to be classifed as neophema's but they were fairly recently assigned their own genus.  They are "bourkie-bourkie".  Catchy, huh?  Good luck.  There are very many species for you to research so have fun.|`|0cd14558b59bca02f88377d3fee26645aa	I'm not for certain, but you can try a Pacific Parrotlet. They are incredibly spunky birds, and they're very cute. I have a cockatiel and a parrotlet. They get along fine, although the parrotlet would have to go in its own cage, like you will do if you got a parrotlet. Given their brave attitudes, they might try to fight with the budgies, so, if that would be the case, I'd say the other option would be another cockatiel. I'm not saying the parrotlet would fight for sure, just that you should take caution, keep an eye on the birds during out of cage time. And, you can teach parrotlets to talk, they talk in little robotic voices, when they fully learn a word that is taught. Mine can click its tongue, meow like a cat, chirp a wolf whistle, say "what's up", "hello", and "Blue" (his name). They cost around $150 and hand trained ones can be handled very easily. Try Sandi Moore, at www.mooreoriginal.com. The name of her bird aviary is Genesis Aviaries. I bought a cockatiel and parrotlet from her, and they're all hand raised.|`|29474df3b6ea60501c4792f02a3325f9aa	a quaker parrot. I just love mine.|`|76a5270cf5ed08738f1456edfa7107bfaa	Zebra finches?
0dbcab5a78b72d97386463d98eaa4726aa	Wait, I was going to answer and then I saw Cole's post. So, let me get this straight, the dogs KNOW that their owners want them to be bad and so they turn bad? OMG, where do you people get your answers from? Does anyone of you actually own a dog? A dog is nothing more then genetics and environment. You CANNOT make it do or be anything other then what those genetics will allow, period. <br>  Are you all so dense and beyond help? Study on what dogs are and how they function BEFORE you come on here and spew your BS, PLEASE........<br>  <br>  ADD: Dutchman, you are talking about apples and I am talking about oranges. We are not talking about things like houbreaking a dog, a behavior that 99% of them can do. We are talking about giving the dog human characteristics that they don't have. A dog will turn bad or good just because its owner said so. A dog will turn out according to its drives and born temperament, both genetic. You cannot take a pointer and make a patrol dog out of it, it is not there genetically. How about them common sense?|`|0f471987caa4cffce810bc61b733838daa	Is there really an OFFICIAL dog from hell...I doubt it.

Then it was GSDs and now its Pitts, ANY of those breeds are primarily GOOD family friendly wonderful dogs.  The problem is the fad bad boy image that makes people think they're bad dogs, then people treat them like they'll be bad dogs, then to please the people they love the dogs become the bad dogs.  Its a crazy self fulfilling prophecy.|`|i7S1zuL9aa	First off I WASN'T going to add my two cents on this question but then I read Greekman's entry I felt compelled. My impression of this site was you didn't have to be a EXPERT or TOP CONTRIBUTOR to enter your thoughts, experiences, opinions or even what you may have heard. That you could do this without concern of an arrogant person being rude, degrading or resorting to name calling. Just as you would with a group of friends in your living room, where in fact most likely we are now. I felt this is what amounts to a compiling of discussions from numerous people and the person asking the question take all the info and makes his own decision.<br>  And now to the question. It is MY EXPERIENCE only haveing owned a AKC Rott and haveing done my own research and reading that the breed has a posesive nature. They were bred to herding and for the protection aspect of taking care of their herd needed to be posesive. They pick one person they claim as their own and only tolerate others. I loved my Rott and he loved me. When we were together he had to be in my back pocket. But when a person he didn't know would come around he would sit next to me and a little rummble would come from his throat as he knew a growl would be met with dicipline. I agree with others, it's the look primarily that has created the stereotype. My daughter has a Rott and Black Lab mix that is the perfect dog in MY opinion. He is a easy going, affectionate to all, generally good natured dog. But he has the size and look of a Rott. He's extremely unlikely to bite anyone but his look will keep strangers at bay.<br>  I have to add most Pit Bulls I HAVE KNOWN seem to be good natured. Owned by friends and raised with the attention and care any dog deserves. They seemed to be good with anyone that would throw the stick or ball.<br>  But as Greekman pointed out you can't take a dog bred for companionship and affection and abuse and beat it to the point it lives in fear and make it aggressive. It's just not in it's genetics!! And in the same way you can't take a Rott or Pit and raise it from a pup with attention, affection and socialization and make it a good natured accepting animal!!!<br>  Instead of talking facts, how about a little common sense???|`|jBvEqUuqaa	Rottwielers are tough and strong.Pitts are too.The only difference is that Rottwielers will show they are when not trained correctly,Pitts will be grown to the way they are raised.If they are neglected,they will be fierce and mean-but if they are raised properly they will be sweet and gentle.Rottwielers are "dominators",which means they are used to being commended by one person and only one person.If they dont like someone else,they will show teeth and growl.I hope this answer helps you figure out why they are used.|`|kUMoh9seaa	I can't believe you would say that!

Give them water and go buy a little thing of mouse or even hamster food. Cheese isn't good for them! If you don't want to buy food at the store, feed them non-sugary cereals and little pieces of vegetables.<br>  <br>  If they've survived this long, they probably have a mother somewhere who is taking care of them. Baby mice won't live long on their own.

It's going to need to be fed once every 1 to 2 hours, if it's still a pinky (and I'm not sure if you need to do this after it starts growing hair or not, just wait some time and check to see if he goes on his own) you need to get a q-tip with warm water on it and rub it on it's stomach and around it's butt to get it to go to the bathroom, otherwise it will die from poison from it's own waste ( poop and pee)<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  ?Hamster lover?|`|1dNRfC2Xaa	those cute little critters cause major disease have you ever heard of the hanta virus. you don't necessarily have to kill them just walk them down the street and let them go free. baby or not.|`|Rfj2ULibaa	Cheese is probably not the best diet.

AQsiugSpaa	Whoa  there Matt,<br>  <br>  First of all let's get real here.  Your statement, <br>  "Removing a part of an animal is the same as removing a part of an animal. Both procedures are done to the convenience of us humans, and one is accepted and the other is not. Seems a bit hypocritical to me." is just not accurate.  While I wholeheartedly agree with you that de-clawing is done for human convenience, which is actually the ONLY reason, neutering and spaying has two major reasons. <br>  <br>  1. Neutering and spaying actually is healthier for a cat. Cats that are not pedigreed, registered cats in a breeding program by "reputable" breeders and who are permitted to go into heat or remain intact males, are subject to uterine infections (pyometria) uterine cancer,ovarian cancer, mammary cancer, and are constantly frustrated with their desire to mate. Male cats can develop testicular cancer, roam outdoors and get into fights and become aggressive.<br>  <br>  2. There are far too many unwanted kittens and cats in shelters, being euthanized for lack of homes.  And neutered/spayed cats do make far better pets, so are much more likely to remain in their homes with their owners.<br>  <br>  Even the reputable breeders who are working on their lines to improve health quality, and appearance, neuter and spay kittens before they are sold. Often this is done to prevent passing on genes which cause great suffering in cats due to illness.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/why_you_should_spay_or_neuter_your_pet.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hsus.org/pets/pet_care/why_yo...</a><br>  Declawing is only done for human convenience and often out of ignorance about what is entailed in the surgery. I won't belabor the horrible details as you have some excellent answers that go into depth about it. Many people are too lazy to clip their cat's nails or don't take the time to learn. Even the most nervous cat owner can learn to do it with ease.<br>  <br>  <br>  There are far more reasons for cats to be our companions than their ability to reproduce. I am speechless in thinking about if neutering and spaying was illegal. We would be overrun by kitties who can not be taken care of, and starve to death with very miserable lives.<br>  <br>  Reasons not to declaw cats are many:<br>  <a href="http://cats.about.com/od/declawing/tp/reasonsnot.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cats.about.com/od/declawing/tp/re...</a><br>  <br>  So while you are passionate in your question, it would be wise to learn the facts and the differences as far as humane treatment of cats is concerned. Your hypothesis is really not one that is in any way accurate, sorry to say. And what in the world do either of your statements have to do with Euthanasia? :::::Scratching my head here::::::::<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Member Cat Writer's Association|`|DtkLsetkaa	Because one is for the cats own good, and the other is for the humans.  Spaying/neutering doesn't affect the health of a cat negatively.  In fact, its MORE healthy for them considering how common cervical and testicular cancer is in cats.  Regardless of the breeding, which can be deadly to a queen, their general health is what is enhanced.  When you declaw a cat, you take off more than just the nails, its the entire first knuckle of the cats paws.  This affects how they walk.  Make a fist and put your 2nd row of knuckles on your desktop.  That is how a cat walks.  Then consider you no longer had your first row.  Imagine how painful that would be.  Other detriments to the cats health include the fact that they will have shoulder, back, and arm muscle problems from not being able to stretch properly, they have their first line of defense taken away, and even if they are indoor, they KNOW its gone, and will feel the need to defend themselves with their teeth to the point of biting their owners.  It also makes kitty litter very painful to walk on and will cause them to have potty accidents.  Spaying/neutering is HEALTHY for the animal, and will potentially save their life.  Declawing takes away what makes a cat a cat.<br>  <br>  Cats cannot make their own decisions.  Its up to their humans to make the right, healthy decisions for them.  Its all about their health and safety.  Spaying/neutering is healthy and helps them, declawing does not.<br>  <br>  Yep, God is imperfect.  You are 100% correct.  You are speaking about this like you are giving them human emotions, desires, feelings which is totally innaccurate.  They aren't people and they are totally different than us.|`|hetZz4c1aa	Can you imagine how cruel it would be to have a pet who constantly was driven to mate and always denied?  A pet is healthier physically and mentally when it has been spayed or neutered.  Not to mention the benefits of not bringing into the world all those unwanted pets.  What can happen to unwanted pets is just to horrible to mention.  All you have to do google animal abuse and you won't sleep well for weeks.<br>  <br>  The controversy of declawing and spay/neuter is like apples and oranges.......entirely different and always will be.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|IuYekkPVaa	One procedure is the removal of an internal reproductive organ, whilst the other is amputation.  Given the choice, I know which I would choose for myself.<br>  <br>  Where I live declawing is banned on the grounds that it is animal cruelty and the law refers to it as an "unnecessary mutilation".  Vets here refuse to perform the surgery because they consider that it causes suffering.

It is an elective surgery performed for the convenience of the owner and to generate extra revenue for the vet.  (According to figures from the HSUS, declawing has generated more than $3 billion income for vets.)  Declawing is actually a misnomer, because it isn't simply the removal of claws, its the amputation of the end of the cat's toes.  Being digitgrade animals they walk on their toes, and this is one of the main reasons that it is considered an inhumane and unnecessary procedure in at least 25 countries.<br>  <br>  Neutering and spaying do have proven health benefits for the cat and can therefore increase their lifespan.<br>  <br>  Intact toms are at greater risk of testicular cancer and more prone to prostate problems.  They fight over territory and the right to mate a female. Through fighting, they spread and contract incurable FeLV and FIV. Neutered toms are far less likely to fight and these risks are much reduced. Fight wounds can lead to blood poisoning, abscesses, the loss of eyes or ears and wounds can be life-threatening. <br>  <br>  An unspayed female is at increased risk of womb infections which will require emergency hysterectomy in order to save the her life. They are at greater risk of mammary cancer and ovarian cancer.  Cats are prolific breeders and repeated pregnancies can have a debilitating effect on the cat's overall health.  The act of mating carries health risks, because the male prevents the female from getting away with a neck bite.  FeLV and FIV can be spread from male to female by this neck-bite.<br>  <br>  Human males and females recover from sterilisation operations with no negative after effects.  If you had the end of your toes amputated and were sent home from hospital a couple of days after surgery and were expected to get around without the aid of a wheelchair or crutches, people would quite rightly be outraged.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	do you know how many kittens get put to sleep daily because of irresponsible owners not getting their cats fixed? ABOUT 10,000 KITTENS PER DAY.  It is much healthier for the cat to be fixed.  Spaying/Neutering is for the cats own good.  How is that convenient to humans in ANY way?  Its making the right decision for the cats well-being, not to convenience us humans.<br>  <br>  Declawing, on the other hand - changes a cats entire life.  After being declawed, the cat cannot successfully exercise - in most cases cannot successfully use the litter box - they start biting people because they cannot use their claws - (and those are only a FEW of the MANY reasons that cats should not be declawed).<br>  <br>  <a href="http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/declawpics/" rel="nofollow">http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/...</a><br>  <br>  Look at those pictures - does that look humane to you?!<br>  <br>  <br>  You're missing the point here - EUTHANASIA is what we are trying to PREVENT by getting our cats spayed/neutered.  Also, nobody said that spaying/neutering is a creation fault.  I think your being a bit dramatic.  Spaying/neutering is preventing unwanted kittens who get sent off to shelters to get euthanized and thats what Kristin meant by saying that "they are born only to die".... get it?|`|zpwJR60baa	Hi, here are my own opinion. <br>  <br>  Cat that are declawed or removing their tendon, and when they get old it is is hard for them to use their paw in the litter, if they get out of the house, no way for them protect them. <br>  <br>  When a cat is fix, they found, cat live longer, as they don't abuse their body at birth, doest no goes in heat, have a lower temperament, and run out and get hit by the car.  <br>  Other is yes... because there are so many of "US" they want to have pet, but does not think of them as a part of the family after they have family or move.  So, a lot of pets are ending up at the shelter, where they can't find family to care for them.<br>  <br>  All together, it is for their health, and long life.|`|c4dny3nfaa	Ah man, you've obviously never read up on these things. I think you should take notice of the answers you've got above explaining it and telling you declawing is cruel, cos they are people who know.

I did do it to protect my female cats from getting mammary cancer, uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, pyometra, from getting pregnant and adding to the pet overpopulation problem and because I know how much they suffer during a heat cycle. I also did it because I am aware that unspayed females who aren't mated never release their ovum and they turn into cysts and tumours from sitting in the ovaries.<br>  <br>  I also did it to protect my male's from testicular cancer, prostate cancer, mammary cancer, to stop them from attempting to escape to search for a mate and risk feline std's, getting hit by a car, attacked by a wild animal and also from living a life never able to relax because of the constant urge to mate and to prevent them from fathering liters and adding to the pet over population problems. <br>  <br>  You need to stop humanizing cats and dogs, they have NO idea what a testical or uterus is and when its removed they have NO idea that anything is even gone. They also don't have sex for pleasure it is extremely painful for the female thanks to sharp backwards facing spikes on the males penis that rake her vagina as he's pulling out. They have sex because of a hormonal urge telling them to do so. They have no concept of what happens when they mate and they have no concept of the biology involved in child birth, nor do they have the ability to stop because of an intense biological urge, that's why its up to us to stop them.<br>  <br>  Spay/neuters are very fast, simply surgeries with a very short recovery time, both my males and females were running around, playing the evening of the surgery and were completely back to normal within 3 days. There are very few side effects and those that do exist almost never occur except for in extremely rare cases.<br>  <br>  As for declawing well that is the AMPUTATION of the cats toes down to the first knuckle to protect our furnitiure. They are completely AWARE of their claws and they KNOW what has been taken when they suffer through this surgery.<br>  <br>  It has NO benefits to the cat whatsoever, and in fact has dozens of NEGATIVE side effects that the vets and owners disregard when having it done.(Including Arthritis, muscle spasms, back and neck misalignment, anxiety, refusal to use the litterbox, life long pain, mistrust of humans leading to fear biting, inability to properly scratch, clean, stretch, jump, painful regrowth of the claw inside the pad causing excruciating pain and require additional surgery, infection leading to amputation of the paw and even the entire leg, the cat being dumped in a shelter because of all of those side effects and never finding a home again, death from being attacked by other cats, dogs, coyotes because they are NOT able to defend themselves or get away without their claws)<br>  <br>  It has been BANNED in 25 countries for being cruelty to animals and I myself have seen first hand the negative consequences it can have.<br>  <br>  Thousands of women choose to have hysterectomies, Thousands of men have vasectomies and there are hundreds who have had to have a testical or testicals removed for different reasons.<br>  <br>  But can you honestly say that One single human would EVER have all of their fingers amputated down the first knuckle simply because their fingers are inconveniencing another person by doing what they were naturally meant to do?<br>  <br>  We don't amputate our childrens fingers for drawing all over the walls, slapping us, stealing the car, smoking up, drinking underage or anything else their fingers can get them into. We TEACH them that what they were doing was wrong.<br>  <br>  But as soon as our cats scratch the couch we have their toes amputated to protect inanimate upholstery with no feeling. If people would research first they would realize that cat's HAVE to scratch its part of their very nature, because their nails are like an onion and they have to scratch to shed the outer most layers, they scent mark with the pads on their feet AND they NEED to use their nails to stretch their muscles.<br>  <br>  Hundreds of thousands of people in countries all over the world have clawed cats, children and beautiful furniture all in one house, the US and canada are living in the dark ages and need to wake up.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Spaying and neutering not only prevents unwanted animals from being euthanized, but it helps your pet avoid future behavioral and health problems.

If that doesn’t impact your opinion about declawing, maybe this website will help you decide: <a href="http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/declawpics/" rel="nofollow">http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/...</a> <br>  <br>  I believe that people who have their cats declawed are uneducated.  It is not very difficult to train your cat to use a scratching post.  The surgery is not simply a trimming of the claws, it’s an amputation of the distal phalanx, including bones, ligaments, and tendons! To remove the claw, the bone, nerve, joint capsule, collateral ligaments, and the extensor and flexor tendons must all be amputated.  If you were to make a comparison, it would be like having the last joint of each of our fingers chopped off.  So of course it is a painful surgery, with a painful recovery.  There are often many complications in the healing process, including infection often from litter box use, resulting in a life-long aversion to the litter box.  Other declawed cats that can no longer mark with their claws, will mark with urine instead, resulting in inappropriate elimination problems.  <br>  <br>  Many cats who have been declawed are traumatized and become withdrawn, nervous, fearful and/or aggressive.  Cats who went through the painful surgery are more prone to resort to biting when they feel threatened.  Since cats have emotional feelings, (just like we do) they can resent you if you decided to get them declawed.  All of these things can cause depression and ultimately lead to an overweight cat.<br>  <br>  If a cat who has been declawed accidentally escapes, he/she would be in great danger.  A cat needs it's claws to defend itself, as well as to escape by climbing.  The constant state of stress, caused by a feeling of defenselessness may make some declawed cats more prone to disease.  Also they cannot stretch their back and shoulder muscles like they do naturally when they dig their claws into a scratching post.  <br>  <br>  One popular alternative is Soft Paws.  They are lightweight vinyl nail caps that you glue on the cat's front claws.  They're great for households with small children and are extremely useful for people who are away from home all day and can't exercise the watchfulness necessary to train a cat to use a scratching post.  Soft Paws are easy to apply and last about four to six weeks.  They come in clear or colors--which are really fun.<br>  <br>  Most common types of damage are scratched furniture, ripped carpets and shredded wallpaper.  You want to eliminate the problem before it occurs.  Buy or build a stable, tall scratching-post, right from the start.  Here are some tips to do it right: If your cat is scratching your furniture or rugs, here is some advice on training them to use a scratching post:<br>  - The post should be at least two feet high, covered with sisal-rope, (mine like the carpeted ones)<br>  - Get more than one, especially when you have a multi-cat household <br>  - Place the post close to the furniture or other areas which are most at risk <br>  - Introduce a new scratching-post with some catnip sprinkled on its surface.  Cats love that and it’s more attractive to them <br>  - If your cat starts scratching the "wrong" object, say "NO" and gently carry your cat to the desired post.  Demonstrate how to use it by scratching the post with your own nails.  If the cat doesn‘t catch on after trying this repeatedly for a few days, gently pick up his paws rub them along the post.<br>  - Never force your cat.  When it starts scratching the post by itself, make sure you use verbal praise with a rewarding treat and plenty of affection.  The cat needs to know that using the scratching post results in positive things such as affection, playing and treats.<br>  - When you have a kitten, start early with the "pawing at post" technique <br>  - Invest in what’s called a “cat tree” which acts also as a leisure area for your cat.  Different textures and heights make it more interesting, you perhaps want to build it yourself <br>  - Try some repellent|`|a634fc83e8cc678200f372815e1d735daa	i have to agree with mostly everyone..<br>  but i think its up to the owner to decide what they will and will not do.<br>  me personally i would never de-claw my kitten..my reason is because i feel its cruel..but im not going to judge other people for their decisions its just i personally wouldn't do it.<br>  but I am going to have my cat fixed when hes old enough. my reason for this is i don't want to add to the overpopulation of cats and kittens dying in a shelter. and i think getting a cat fixed is helpful to them not hurting them..everyone wants a cute little kitten without thinking of the commitment and then that cute little kitten that was a birthday gift or an easter present or a christmas gift is now left to die in a shelter..but this is only my personal opinion..|`|b6400b04a0e3413ba30570ad0aa8cd2baa	Well first they aren't "cutting off your sex organs" Spaying and neutering is known to have many health benefits. Cancer in the reprodictive organs is sadly common. By getting the animals spayed/neutered you will be preventing this from happening, therefore saving their lives. It also helps with behaviour problems. People who have ever had a female cat go into heat know what i'm talking about. They go insane. They will also do ANYTHING to get to a male (or a male will do anything to get to a female) and they may end up hurting themselves. When you get a cat spayed/neutered you are preventing them from continually reproducing which is HORRIBLE for the female. I work at a shelter and we saw a cat come in who had so many litters right after each other because they refused to get her spayed that she had a prolapsed uterus. If you don't know what that means it that her uterus came out of her through her vagina. It may sound gross but that is the reality of it. Declawing is makein the cat walk on a bone that cats are not adapted to walking on. They will get major pains in their feet when they get older, sadly they won't show it until it is extreme because it's their instinct to hide pain. Plus if they get ouside how do they defend themselves? WIth their teeth? That requires them to get much closer therefore increasing the liklihood that they will be injured. Declawed cats also get behaviour issues most of the time. They may stop using the litter box because the feeling is to much on their paws. They may also begin to bite much more because they realize  that it is the way they can defend themselves. <br>  In the end spaying/neutering only benefits the animals and declawing only hurts it in the long run.|`|gU34xa9vaa	Neutering cats  is not only for the sake of unwanted kittens being born,it's to prevent problems to them in later life. I've assisted at operations on queen cats with their wombs full of pus, because they've come into heat time after time. I've seen old queen  cats worn out with giving birth to kittens time after time and the kittens 'put to sleep' because no one wants them. I've seen tom cats with terrible infected wounds, ears torn off, eyes scratched, due to fighting over queen cats.I agree we have no right to take away any natural functions of any animal,but seeing as our ancestors domesticated them so many years ago, we have no choice now. We can never turn them back out into the wild, where they used to live natural lives.<br>  Declawing is completely different, it's an un-neccessary procedure from which cats never recover, it causes them many problems because cats need their claws for almost everything they do.<br>  Declawing is banned in 25 countries for good reason, it's animal abuse,it's excruciatingly painful for the cat and more and more vets are now refusing to do it.Recovery from neutering is very quick, recovery from declawing is never ! <br>  It's as simple as this, cats come with claws, anyone who doesn't like that fact,shouldn't have a cat.<br>  Yes God is imperfect I'm afraid, so are we and what's scary is that we have the power over animals who can't speak for themselves. <br>  It's all wrong !|`|x0WZE0i4aa	Cats are not human, but... there are plenty of people out there who have chosen to be sterilized.  Can't say I've actually ever heard of a person who's chosen to have part of each finger lopped off, whether it's by guillotine or laser.  Could it be that there are advantages to being sterilized, but not to losing finger tips?<br>  <br>  The advantages to a cat of being neutered: it reduces the risk of straying.  It reduces the risk of cancers.  It reduces the risk of catching viruses transmitted through mating.  It reduces the risk of fighting injuries.  <br>  <br>  To cat kind as a whole, it reduces unwanted kittens.  To keep a stable population each mother cat only needs to have 2 kittens grow to adulthood, 1 to replace her, and 1 to replace the father.  Even if each female has 1 litter, that litter is on average going to have 4 plus kittens in it.  Simple math, even if each female had 1 litter, only half of female cats need to have litters.  And of course, an uneutered female is not going to stop at 1 litter...  How nature (or God if you like) handles it is that kittens have a very high death rate: from accidents, predation and disease.  Most people think it's better to protect our kittens from those dangers, and stop excess being born in the first place.<br>  <br>  And the advantages of being declawed?  Being able to stay with someone who'd put you through a painful operation to save their furniture.  Doesn't sound much of an advantage to me... especially when any further less 'solveable' problems (due to being declawed or not), are likely to end the cat in a shelter anyway.|`|wx1WVpP5aa	It's already all been explained above , hope it's helped you.Just want to add I agree that neutering is necessary but declawing is not. The first is over and forgotten in a few days, the second is lifelong mutilation which people who truly love cats, would never put their pets through.|`|2AOzkBPJaa	Have you ever seen a cat in heat? its miserable, in excruciating amounts of pain, and can't think about anything but getting laid.  My kitten started her first heats and they didn't stop for a month, until her vet appointment to be spayed.  She lost so much weight, and howled incessantly. Some cats, once they begin a heat, can stay permanently in heat until they are impregnated.  Spaying is doing the cat justice.  Neutering will keep your male cats from exhibiting dominant male behaviour, spraying, being a nuisance to your neighbours, and running away to find a lady.  If we spay and neuter our pets we're also being responsible and not contributing to excessive cat population (which will just result in sick, unwanted strays, and more excessive reproduction)  Spaying and neutering improves a cats quality of life.  Spaying and neutering is not removing a cats sexual organs.  You are not removing the vagina or the penis.  Humans actually do have hysterectomies, or have their fallopian tubes "tied" or have vasectomies.  So it's not hypocritical at all.  Humans also have contraceptives, and abortion is an option, to control our populations.  It isn't the slightest bit hypocritical.  I use contraceptives, I spay or neuter my animals.  It's being a responsible member of society.  <br>  When you declaw a cat you are removing a part of their body which is essential for self defense.  It does the cat no justice, it just makes it convenient for the owner who will never have to deal with the cat clawing their furniture, screens, blinds etc.|`|UpU5eep9aa	Neutering is a completely different issue to declawing because there is benefit to the cat from neutering. In the case of a female cat it can save her suffering womb cancer or pyometra which is an infection in the uterus, this happens because when the queen comes into heat her progesterone levels emain high for 8-10 weeks and thicken in preparation for pregnancy. If pregnancy doesn't occur over the course of several heats the lining of the uterus continues to thicken until cysts form within it, these cysts secrete fluid that create ideal conditions for bacteria to grow within the womb, bacteria is introduced via the vulva. This can happen to young queens but the likelihood increases as the cats gets older. Speying removes the womb and so removes the threat of this happening. Tom cats are notorious for marking and staking their territory and for fighting, this can lead to open wounds which can easily pick up infection in outside conditions and it can also lead to feline leukaemia if the fight is with an infected cat, castration removes most of the male territorial instincts and so removes the need to fight. You cannot compare these procedures with declawing which is always carried out for the benefit of the cat's owner and never for the cat. I'm sorry to say that declawing is the easy option for owners and one which causes great physical and psychological damage to many cats. In more than 25 civilized countries this has been rightly banned for the animal abuse that it is, and our furniture while maybe not PURRfect is good enough, it is love that makes the ideal home and not furniture. When the option of declawing is removed by the ban being enforced in the USA and Canada then owners will either have to tackle their problems in a human way by providing their cat with scratching posts and gentle training and NOT swatting or they will have to decide that to them their furniture is more important than a warm loving companion animal and so not have a cat at all. The ban cannot come soon enough for me and my fellow campaigners, I have seen the damage done to cats by botched declawing operations and I have a collection of personal experiences from cat owners who rue the day that they submitted their cats to this barbaric act.|`|gjrbp1Aoaa	If I had to go through heat cycles like a cat then I think I would want to be spayed. Humans are fortunate enough to have a choice about whether or not we want to reproduce.  Some people make bad decisions, but they still got to make a decision.<br>  <br>  Nature has decided for cats.  It's not about God.  People interfered with cats.  They decided that they should be pets, that changes a lot about their lives.  A wild mother cat will live a challenging life and try to raise as many kittens as possible to carry on the species. The majority of those kittens will not become adults so the population can stay balanced. If the number of cats goes up too much the prey animals will be less common and cats will starve or be prey themselves to reduce the population to something sustainable.<br>  But a pet cat still has that instinct to make as many cats as she can but generally does not have the same sort of dangers. If we let pets breed as nature dictates then we would always be over-whelmed with cats. As it is, there are too many and not enough homes. We have messed around with nature and we attempt to fix that by fixing the cats. <br>  <br>  Cats don't breed for pleasure. They don't watch over their grown children with the satisfaction of job well done. By the time a wild kitten is approaching maturity mom is usually pregnant with the next litter. I have a girl cat sleeping on my lap now.  She is a mother. She was a stray cat, most likely abandoned to live outside. I know she had at least one litter outside and probably more.  As best as I can tell, one kitten survived out there (I caught him when he was about 6 months old). When she decided to come inside she was pregnant again. She had 4 perfect kittens and was wonderful with them.  But she isn't mom anymore.  Now she's a playmate and a friend. She seems much happier.  She used to be stressed and cry all the time. Now she loves to run around and chase after the other cats. I honestly feel somewhat cruel for letting her have the kittens at all. She seems so much more at ease without heat cycles and sharp toothed little creatures sucking on her.<br>  <br>  If you want to have a pet it must be treated as a pet. Bringing a constant supply of unwanted kittens into the world is far more cruel than simply denying a pet sexual maturity. Yes, everything that lives will eventually die but there's no reason to let a cat breed just so the babies can be continuously exterminated at shelters or given to humans who may treat them horribly. <br>  <br>  It's not something that can even be compared with declawing. Declawing is done for people who are too lazy to train cats and value their furniture more than their pet's wellbeing. Declawing can also result in a lifetime of pain. <br>  <br>  I live with 6 wonderful cats.  4 of them were once living outside on their own. I would never be able to take care of them if they were breeding with each other and they would probably not get along like they do. They spend their days sleeping, eating, playing together, and grooming each other. They have little interest in the outside. Unless you think that it is cruel to keep cats as pets then spaying and neutering is a necessary thing to do.|`|uiCR425Uaa	There is a big difference between de-clawing and de-sexing a cat. <br>  <br>  1)When a cat is spayed or neutered, they recover quickly and have no lasting pain. De-clawing is more like cutting off your finger-tips than cutting off your fingernails. Cats walk on their toes. The procedure is extremely painful to recover from and in some cases the cat can live in pain.<br>  <br>  2) De-clawing takes away a cats ability to defend itself from predators. De-sexing will prevent animal pregnancy and the urge to mate, but it won't stop them from trying! <br>  <br>  3)Spaying and neutering isn't purely for convenience. It's for the safety of the animal and to prevent the suffering of animals who would be born only to die and suffer from over-population. Specifically in the case of females, if you don't spay them and yet allow them to go into heat without mating, they can develop painful cysts in their ovaries. Their intense urge to find a mate can also put them in danger, as they will try to escape to get outside and find a mate - placing them in danger of being hit by a car and the other dangers associated with feral living.

Although, I personally think Papillon are really cute but make sure this breed is right for you and your family.<br>  <br>  Check out these websites...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.akc.org/breeds/papillon/" rel="nofollow">http://www.akc.org/breeds/papillon/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/papillon.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/papillon.htm</a>|`|4HeeBMokaa	Well dogs are like humans they have different feeling about stuff.|`|AA11248201	Small dog and small child, what could be cuter, right? Except the reality is that it rarely works out. Papillons are typically not a good choice for a household with very small children, or older children who want to be able to "roughhouse" with a dog, because of their small size. This breed also tends to have pretty high self-esteem; a Papillon will protect itself if it feels threatened or mistreated. While your kids are definitely angels and would never mistreat any animal, any home with a dog and children requires lots of extra commitment and constant supervision by the adults in the household to ensure that everyone treats each other responsibly. We find that when people add a Papillon to a household with children, the parents usually have a dog and have kids, but the kids don't have a dog.<br>  Sorry that they're not, but many breeds are great with kids! Just keep looking!|`|DLXg1gJRaa	In my experience, no.  The Papillons I knew working in a dog kennel and a doggie daycare were nervous, delicate, yappy dogs.  If you want a good lapdog that can take a bit more roughhousing, you might choose a Cocker Spaniel if you can find a breeder near you with dogs that have good temperaments.  You could also try the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel but you'll have to be careful to find a healthy one because they can have very bad heart and knee problems.  Small terriers and spaniels, hardier dogs, are a better choice with children than most of the Toy breeds.|`|ekUZYfgzaa	I had a papillon when I was in elementary/middle school. My brother is a few years younger and we got along with the dog fine. We also had a toddler niece in that time and our dog was fine. My niece pulled the dogs hair a few times and the dog jumped, but never bit. They are quite smart and friendly but may prefer the older members of the family.|`|437c1f4f17c55610b255a3cf79c146cbaa	get a puppy train it to be good but yes they are natrualy good with kids|`|b872e6109d83901f6b21430160dcadcaaa	papillions are sissy dogs, so probably not. The more little and really cute and "fuzzy wuzzy cuddly " they look, the worse their personality tends to be.

d42c34ff42d7b1a4c999f30da1751f64aa	Thats too bad that they didnt do anything with them. But I think once you gain their trust, you'll find out that you got yourself a great pet. I recently got 2 adult rats that havent been handled at all. They were suppose to be feeder rats. <br>  <br>  I got one a few weeks before I got the other so needless to say he's a bit more tame now than the other one, but I'll tell you what I did.<br>  <br>  For the first few days, I sat on the floor next to his cage, pet him, and talked gently to him. At first whenever he'd see me coming he'd dart to the bottom of the cage and hide in his igloo (who knows...maybe my voice annoyed him?)  but soon he wouldnt run and hide because he figured out I wasnt going to harm him. He'd stay where he was and let me pet him..But he still didnt want me to hold him.<br>  <br>  Then I started offering him treats. He was still too shy to take them directly from my hand, so I'd just set them down right in front of him, and continue to sit there and talk softly while he ate the treat I put infront of him.<br>  <br>  After a few days of this I decided he'd had enough "settling in" time and enough time to figure out that my hands werent a threat to him. I forced him (gently) to let me pick him up. Of course he ran about 100 miles per hour once I got him out but I kept holding him. I looked at the clock and made it a point to hold him for 20 minutes.(I got this advice from another yahoo user, when I asked, which method is best for taming rodents.) After 20 minutes was up, I put him back in his cage and let him recover from the "trauma" I just inflicted on him.....then a few hours later I did the same thing again. (keep in mind, when rats are scared they tend to poop a lot ....so, I'd have a kleenex handy). <br>  <br>  After a few days of doing this, he started slowly coming around. I'd take him out, he'd put up a fight for about 2 or 3 minutes.. then he'd give up , nestle himself in my arm and be content with me petting him while he groomed himself.<br>  <br>  <br>  Keep in mind, once you get them out, If you let them, the first place theyre gonna head for is your shoulder, to get away from you.. This is fine ....AFTER theyre tame. But if they just sit on your shoulders for half an hour a day theyre not gonna learn anything. I made this mistake when I was a new rat owner. I stupidly thought that my rat was tame because I took her out and she'd run right for my shoulder. She wasnt tame, she was trying to get away, because I'd never made her get used to being handled. <br>  <br>  But like I said, after theyre tame, and know youre not a threat, if they wanna sit on your shoulders, thats fine. <br>  <br>  Anyway, seeings as they went most of their lives with no social contact, you might have a bit of a battle on your hands, but rats are very social, with a little patience, persistance, (and lots of treats) they'll come around.<br>  <br>  <br>  By the way--if you have them in a tank, you should get them a wire cage.(made for rats..a hamster cage is way too small)  Rats love climbing. They also need a nice big wheel to exercise on, things to chew on, and a bed to sleep in (mine have a plastic igloo, and a wicker basket I picked up at the dollar store, I got that so they could chew on it and sleep in it)<br>  <br>  Good luck with your new babies:)|`|1ca2c89d196814c1a33146ab527ceca8aa	i love rats there like a smaller chawawa once you get them too trust you there very lovable,until my pet rat died of old age it was the best pet in the world, but a word of warning, they multiply quickly,if you have a male and female you will keep having babies over and over,as soon as there old enough they will keep mating with each other,you can quickly get over run....|`|1f1556b47fa5468b082b722ab21655f9aa	rats are great you can teach them tricks and alot of other stuff here is a GREAT website Rattyrat.com|`|uEpIfvIXaa	Rats are one of the most intelligent small mammals and much more intresting than hamsters or gerbils. I recomend you give them treats now and again to get them to trust you and let them smell you so they reconize your smell (smell is very important to rats) and carry on what you're doing-stroking. After a while of this they should begin to trust you and let you pick them up.DO NOT pick rats up by their tails because <br>  a) They hate it and may bite you <br>  b) It can hurt the rat and its tail could fall off|`|AA11603761	Just keep doing what you are doing.|`|84586829f7be0e36c991785f0e801cabaa	It will take time to build trust, so just keep doing what you're doing. You could also feed it directly, play with it, etc. My brother had one at school, and it turned out to be the most loving, playful, wonderful pet we had, but they are also very skittish and intelligent, so really, just give it time, and gradually build a friendship. If it dislikes something you do, back off, try something different. You'll get it right.
ZRScOoU7aa	NO!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  If you haven't got any hamster food left, give it small amounts of bread and plenty of water|`|389c7ca909ed8e7d45814f58d66fe8bbaa	NO, NO, NO!!!!  They can only be given food meant for them plus the food from the list on the link below.  Now you can give an unflavored dog biscuit to a hamster that chews a lot, especially on the bars.  You need to go and read up on how to properly care for a hamster.  Either buy a book on them or read the information in these sites-all hve good information on them.|`|66629a3137947175f15abec9ba92d9bfaa	Of course you can, but will they eat it? I'm not so sure.|`|Ja3kXyelaa	Like all animals, they will always want something different, but feed them proper hamster food.  Every pet has different dietary needs, and they need to be met for optimum health.|`|Rl4GIsYQaa	yes. i have a book called 'Gerbils' by Anmarie Barrie. it has 42 pages about "feeding gerbils"  it states that you can reward your gerbils occasionaly with a dog bisquit. so i asume since hamsters and gerbils both eat the same you could give a dog biscuit to your hamster or a piece of dried dog food. some other foods you could give your hamster , if you run out of hamster food are nuts,clovers, dandelions, vegtables, wheats or oats. they eat about a tablespoon, or 0.3oz of food daily. good luck :)|`|a5Ui7Ryhaa	I'm going to say you probably can, but why would you want to?  I don't have hamsters, but, my kids have pet rats.  We feed them hamster and gerbil food, and our food.(not too much sugar)Maybe give them some fruit or something instead of the dog food?|`|9SPQeqXxaa	Well I'm not sure it's the BEST thing for them but i have personal experience in that it won't kill them lol. Our hamster escaped his cage and we found him 2 weeks later behind our washing machine..He had been surviving off of Dog Food the whole time! lol So it definetely doesn't kill them but feeing them hamster food or whatever is probably better for them.

5CyZ2Jmlaa	Hola Madame!<br>  El problema que presenta tu perrito se denomina "Coprofagia", puede ser que te esté indicando una deficiencia de fósforo en su dieta, o bien simplemente se trata de un mal hábito. Para empezar, un cambio gradual de alimento sería lo indicado; siempre es preferible dar croquetas de buena calidad.<br>  Ahora, para resolver el problema, cada vez que lo veas lo rega?as con un buen "No!", lo tomas por el pellejo del cuello y lo zarandeas un poco (las perras rega?an así a sus cachorros). Aparte, cuando no te vea, rocía un poco de pimienta, chile o vinagre sobre el excremento. Estos sabores desagradana  los perros, y eventualmente eliminarás la mala conducta.<br>  Saludos!|`|be7536eb35c5fdc4d1a743cdf2bd47d0aa	Hola, <br>  no te preocupes mucho<br>  simplemente llévalo al veterinario porque es indicio de que le hace falta calcio... o sea,  cuando un perro busca comer las heces de otros animales ó inclusive los propios, es indicio claro de que le hace falta vitamina, y en este caso es el Calcio...<br>  de todas maneras consúltalo con tu veterinario de confianza y verás que no tiene nada grave tu mascota...<br>  simplemente es cuestion de vitaminas y alimentación sana...<br>  Saludos<br>  Brisa|`|9WPff0zqaa	Dale agua..para que baje....es normal que los perros lo hagan...No te preocupes..saludos

Se pueden llegar a encariar enormememte con otros animales o personas, or supuesto.<br>  Por otro lado, no existe el lesbianismo como tal en los canes. Que tu perra monte a la gata solo es una forma de desahogar la tensión sexual y demostrar qué es lo que quiere. Puede incluso hacerlo sin que esté en celo, y es como comunican la dominancia por sobre toro animal. Es natural tanto en hembras como en machos no te apures.<br>  Y lod e la comida para gatos... es normal, haha. Las croquetas para perro son mucho más desabridas que el alimento para gato. ?Nunca escuchaste la frase "tiene paladar de gato"? Se usa para referirse a una persona remilgosa a la hora de comer. Los gatos son más exigentes en ese aspecto que los perros, por eso el sabor de su alimento es más apetitoso...

Your dog could have swallowed something, have a blockage, you never know.<br>  Never give a human medication to an animal, either.  Many medications, esp. tylenol, are deadly for dogs and cats.  And what may seem to be a condition we associate as human, is not what may be going on for an animal.  <br>  <br>  Please contact your vet, and ask their opinion, because in the end, a professional is who is needed for your animal.  <br>  <br>  I wish you luck with your dog.|`|K0VTGWxdaa	I would call the vet and ask what's safe to give her.<br>  <br>  I also would let her know the symptoms that your dog is having.

0bZmlZ94aa	Just do not put the bette in too big an aquarium (I would guess over 5 gallons) and too strong a filtration system. Bettas live regularly in still motionless water. A small filter is ok, but if you get a big filter you are requiring the betta to swim along with the current it creates, and this sometimes kills them from exhasution because they arnt used to swimming much at all. <br>  <br>  As long as you keep its environment small, do not over feed it (fed every 2-4 days only small amounts) Anbd you do the regularl water changes the Betta should be fine. They are very healthy fish and some customers at my store have told me their betta lived for over 5 years (good life span considering its a fish) Bettas are pretty hardy and so you shouldnt have a problem switching it between tanks.|`|FSscae4Naa	they are kept in smal bowls because they can live there not becasue they DO live there. but thye also don't need lots of water. a 1-2.5 gallons in plenty for 1 betta and maybe a few guppies, any more would somewhat be of a waste. they don't ned 5 or 10 but a bowl is a little cruel. just remember 1-2.5 gal. a shelf should be able to hold the 10-25 lbs it wieghs. (8lb/gal +rocks, filter, lights etc)|`|lS3NPgkRaa	I would suggest that you get a 3 gallon to 4 gallon aquarium... possibly a 5 gallon.|`|gV9ABqA1aa	My father used to breed bettas, and for the males, at least, YES those tanks are built to torture them!  Male bettas have been bred way past what their wild counterparts look like and have extremely heavy fins that make it VERY VERY hard for them to swim against current in a larger tank with a filter set-up.  Usually they end up exhausting themselves and get stuck to the filter intake tube and die. There are some very nice acrylic mini tanks that you can set up that have lights - if you absolutely feel like you MUST have one with a filter, I reccommend Red Sea's AquaVase Combo.  The filter is extremely small and it can be turned down low enough to not bother the betta (or turned off and only run for certain times a day).|`|PBBdapCWaa	The small mini bow you mention is a good home for a betta.  I would suggest one in a 2.5 gallon range as the very best choice, but a 1 gallon with a filter will be just fine as long as you keep up with the water changes on a very regular basis.<br>  <br>  MM

(so is the maltese in some cases)|`|AA11882192	A lot of care goes into both breeds with the hair.  My mother owned a Maltese, he was a very sweet dog.  She named him Button because she said his eyes and nose looked like buttons in all that white.  The only thing I have to say about them is that, and I mean no offense to any maltese owner, they seem a little retarded.  Please don't take offese to this, I have talked to other owners and they said the same thing.  One reason I say this is that when you have slick floors it doesn't matter how many times the dog does this it will happen every time, the dog will make a turn and run right into the wall, everytime.  Maltese are very laid back dogs, they do not bark much, they are very sweet, and lovable.  <br>  <br>  Shi tzu's are ok, they bark way too much, can  be over protective, and very tempermental.  All the shi tzu's I have ever met have been very annoying.  They are cute dogs, don't get me wrong, and it may be that the people that owned the particular dogs I saw did not know how to train their dogs to be less aggressive.  If you can find the right temperment then they are great dogs.  <br>  <br>  If you have the option, look at the parents, see how they react to strangers, and to their owners, that sometimes (not all the time), helps to see about how the puppy will turn out.  Also, watch the puppies play, don't just go for the cutiest one, find the one that matches you.  Or if you are patient, sit with the puppies, and see if one "picks" you.<br>  <br>  Get the dog that you want, they will both have their problems.  If you get the one that you want, and not one that you "settled for" the cons won't matter as much.<br>  <br>  Again these is just my personal opinions, and I do not mean to offend anyone by my personal opinions.|`|cb27ba49c86565f715d352c5f1517cb7aa	i think shi tzu because i have one , shi tzu's are pretty loyal and a great companion.|`|fd2b54c9418bd772c16180ce23271c00aa	hmmmmmm i am not sure which one is better<br>  I have a maltese cross shi tzu she is really cute.|`|f8a3e1916a1358a55f2e47b7e870da88aa	both dogs have the same issues.  i find shih tzu's have more trouble because of their squished in face.  if you have done your research and know to keep the eye area clean with a warm damp cloth, and just know this is the dog for you, convince your dad to get the maltese by all means!  if you don't get the dog you want you will always wonder.  good luck.|`|AA12283368	this is a hard but if I were you I would get a shi tzu. Even though those two dogs are SO playful and cute, a maltese has tearing stains, like you said but it will be complicated <br>  If you are willing to get a maltese to get rid of the tear stain:<br>  <br>  A teaspoon of white cider vinegar can be added to your dogs drinking water to control new tear stains.  It may take a while for your dog to "decide" to drink this water so start with a little less and gradually increase the amount of vinegar.  Vinegar works much like TUMS in that it can changes the pH of the drinking water. Changing the pH of your dog slightly will do wonders in the tear stain war and help eliminate bacteria and deep stain color and prevent yeast build up and is best used as a prevention once you have the tear stains removed or nearly removed.

They were the dog of the Kings Quarters.

Also I don't know what kind of dog you have but some breeds grow excess hair in their ears and it needs to be plucked this can also cause an odor.

THATS what stinks, the oil glands working overtime!<br>  Use a waterless bath spray, or powder to keep his face, privates and folds of skin clean. No chemicals or detergents please! You can use a doggy-safe cologne to freshen him up, or possibly a leave-in conditioner if it doesnt aggrevate him. <br>  Don't use people products, make sure you buy balanced doggy products!!|`|bb60640c96610ff5b7eb5df5251f191caa	Stop bathing him to much. Dogs should only be bathed once every six months unless obviously dirty. Daily brushing will keep them clean and their coats healthy between baths. Overbathing will lead to dry itchy skin. It also strips the dogs skin of its natural oils, when this happens the skin goes into to overload to make more, and creates more dog smell. The more you bath, the more your dog is going to smell. Also dry itchy skin can lead to skin infections such as staph or yeast. <br>  <br>  Diet can also play a factor in doggie odor as well. Switch your dog to a higher quality food and in a few weeks you should notice less doggie odor as well. <br>  <br>  Nothing you find at a grocery store is going to be a good food. High quality foods can be found at large pet store chains, or online. A couple of foods I like are Nutro Natural, Innova, Innova Evo and Cannidae.<br>  <br>  There are other high quality dog foods. Here's how to spot them:<br>  <br>  A high quality food will have little or no fillers such as corn, wheat or soy. These aren't very digestable for dogs, and are common food related allergens. Since you were seeing corn meal in the first few ingredients, those are not high quality foods. Foods list ingredients by content, with the ingredient it contains most of at the top.<br>  <br>  A high quality food will not contain BHT, BHA or Ethoxyquin, these are all chemical preservatives that have been linked to cancer.<br>  <br>  A high quality food will not contain by-products of any kind. Meat meals are ok as long as the source of the meat is listed, such as Chicken Meal. <br>  <br>  A high quality diet should have meat as at least the first ingredient., and be made from human grade ingredients. Foods that don't use human grade ingredients often get their ingredients from less than desirable sources, such as meat from animals that were diseased, or euthanized.<br>  <br>  There is another diet option other than dog food. Some people choose to feed a raw diet. This involves feeding the dog raw meaty bones and organ meat. However it is not as simple as throwing a couple chicken bones in a bowl everyday. If you wish to feed this type of diet, do lots and lots of research first. Switching to this diet without knowing what your doing can lead to nutritional problems for your dog. I'll give you some links as a starting point in research if you are interested in this type of diet.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.willowglen.com/barf.htm........." rel="nofollow">http://www.willowglen.com/barf.htm.........</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bestfrisbeedogs.com/diets.htm..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bestfrisbeedogs.com/diets.htm...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.rawlearning.com/rawfaq.html....." rel="nofollow">http://www.rawlearning.com/rawfaq.html.....</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.rawfed.com/myths/index.html....." rel="nofollow">http://www.rawfed.com/myths/index.html.....</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.rawdogranch.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawdogranch.com</a><br>  <br>  What's Really In Pet Food<br>  <a href="http://www.api4animals.org/facts?p=359&m..." rel="nofollow">http://www.api4animals.org/facts?p=359&m...</a> <br>  <br>  \|`|e41a4d80df8e5a9e6f0d182f3531b31caa	Bulldogs are a stinky breed. They produce extra oils in their skin that cause them to get a doggy odor. Also, they often get infections in their wrinkles that will cause them to stink. There is not much that you can do, but it does help to put them on a super premium dog food (I really like Natural Balance for my Bullies) and clean the wrinkles daily. The Natural Balance also really helps with the flatulence that Bullies usually always have.
AA10135392	Not to burst your bubble, but pets tend to be the worst gifts, especially higher maintenance ones like dogs.

You'll want an experienced breeder that monitors their stock very carefully for temperment, medical problems and undesirable stock. You should be able to veiw both parents at least, and the puppies in the litter of the puppy you want; the parents will tell you how the puppy will grow up and the litter will tell you how the puppies interact. You want an outgoing puppy that isn't afraid of you or others and has no noticable medical problems. The breeder will probably offer you a contract insuring that the puppy will not have serious genetic problems and requiring you to get the puppy spayed or neutered along with a return policy if the puppy should come down with a disease within a certain amount of time after adoption.<br>  <br>  Be aware that breeder stock is often more expensive but pet shops and local shelters more often than not don't screen their animals well and you could end up with an aggressive dog that has a multitude of problems.|`|5f1d26c479ebf1dc1c0e071969fc0500aa	Go to www.petfinder.com and you will find alot of cute little dogs<br>  good luck finding a dog|`|JIOj2bSbaa	You posted a question kinna like this a few minutes ago. ^^;<br>  <br>  Usually, when you're trying to find any breed of dog, it's best to check the classifieds section in your local newspaper or the local animal shelter; if that fails, look on the internet for breeders of that certain breed in your area.|`|aKQLAaLnaa	A what wiler?|`|ea96ef5e0cba92e27b1bc95efed51cd0aa	From your local humane society! Also, depending on where you live you may be able to a rescue group for the particular breed of dog you are wanting. Many times humane societies and rescue groups can connect you with a dog who will work well with your personality and family---and many times they can find you a dog that is pureblooded. <br>  <br>  If you *have to, have to* have a pureblood dog that you raise from a puppy--first remember that this is a huge committment. Make sure you have the resources (money, time, energy) to give this dog. Then find a responsible breeder (not from a pet store!) from who you can purchase the dog--a good breeder will make sure to begin socializing his / her puppies, not keeping them locked up in a pen or cage 24/7.<br>  <br>  Petfinder is a great resource to connect you with local shelters / rescue groups. You can even search based on age and gender of the dog you want.

Il peut arriver qu'elle mordent (c'est assez rare) mais leur venin cytotoxique (attaquant les cellules et nécrosant les tissus) n'est pas dangereux pour l'homme.<br>  <br>  L'attaque se traduit par une simple rougeur enflée et chaude au niveau de la morsure. Ne pas gratter, ni pincer, vous ne feriez que risquer d'infecter la minuscule blessure et d'étendre l'influence du venin dans vos tissus. Laver simplement à l'eau froide et du savon pour éliminer le venin de surface.<br>  <br>  Pour éviter les araignées...dans la maison <br>  Ne pas éclairer le soir, cela attire les insectes donc leur prédateurs, les araignées.<br>  <br>  Passer l'aspirateur dans les coins haut des pièces et détruire les cocons, les oeufs s'y trouvent.<br>  <br>  Faire plus attention en automne, lorsque les températures baissent, les proies sont plus rares à l'exterieur et il fait meilleur à l'interieur.<br>  <br>  Une araignée n'a pas une très bonne vue mais réagit très bien aux vibrations...qui l'attirent.<br>  <br>  Pour les bombes aerosols anti-araignée, elles sont nocives pour tout le monde.|`|931dbc13ad7209ad1b6966b8cbddea49aa	fais le ménage et surtout enlève les toiles !!! il y a des bombes très efficaces !!|`|39c11d2c421e44f49f5bc4ccbf62aaf9aa	Les crochets des araignées "communes" ne sont pas du tout adaptés pour mordre notre peau, ?a leur sert à immobiliser leurs proies. Les araignées ne viennent pas sur nous pour nous mordre, on peut même les manipuler à la main sans problème. Tes piq?res sont probablement des piq?res de puces, de moustiques ou autres. Moi non plus je n'aime pas vraiment les araignées, mais je peux te rassurer sur un point : elles sont inoffensives.|`|7cca502864c9c9ce570463a051903dafaa	mets du vinaigre sur tes boutons,ce n'est pas la petite bête qui mangera la grosse, disait ma grand mère!|`|de9b4a07452d793dc3ca2c1466c09e46aa	Excellente question.<br>  <br>  Moi, ce ne sont pas les piq?res qui me gênent.<br>  Mais je suis arachnophobe à mort et j'attends avec impatience les réponses!|`|qrUNnZ8Gaa	non elles ne piquent pas et tu pprrends une grands boite et  tu leve ta main et tu le met dans la boite|`|1995bd55241edc40f4d2eede24a9b330aa	Salut, perso je ne pense pas que les araignées piquent, en tout cas pas celles des maisons!

6857261a55fc8c9f40ed66697a91dc43aa	Yes, you can and if it's longhaired you will have to every so often. I washed mine (several of them and of various ages) in the bathroom sink, kept the water shallow and used a mild shampoo (baby or small pet shampoo). Make sure you rinse well, towel dry thoroughly and, if needed, you can use a blow dryer...but not set on hot. Keep it moving too...not focused on one section for too long. Please make sure to keep him/her away from drafts...avoid chills. I've included a couple links on bathing and a couple on care/supplies.|`|167bfc46c5befa6949975758b58fee41aa	I would suggest only giving a guinea pig a bath if really needed - ie, is dirty or has lice. Bathing too much dries out the skin so no more baths than say, every 3 months. Shampoo can be bought from the petshop. The water should only be a few inches deep as their bodies are very short and low down. <br>  Guinea pigs should have a big cage (see www.guineapigcages.com) otherwise they will become unhappy and will be very shy of you. Mine never run away to be picked up and are always popcorning in their big cages. I made four -massive- cages and I only had to spend ￡100 on materials. Petshop cages are too small and are overpriced! <br>  Guinea pigs need hay (preferably timothy hay), vegetables (carrots, cucumber, cabbage...etc), dry food (mine have and love Science Selective), a hidey house to hide in, a water bottle, and a few toys (tunnels and soft toys). <br>  If you offer all this to your guinea pig he will turn out to be a more interesting pet because he will be happy. The babies at petshops are often very shy because they are from breeding mills - it is preferable to buy from a breeder or rescue from a shelter.<br>  Guinea pigs are great - and addictive! People don't realise how cute they are until they own one.<br>  <br>  Ignore the first answerer Tars - guinea pigs are lactose intolerant (can't drink milk), choke on nuts, don't use wheels or exercise balls (not good for their back). I think Tars just said all that merely for a 'joke', not very funny though is it?<br>  <br>  Guinea pigs NEVER bite - I have had 40 guinea pigs throughout my life and have never been bitten. I had two RATS however and they bit me everytime I held them.|`|1f1a260890eeea96d41ef9e0c7885d8aaa	no ,you can't .it will soak up her fur. details:feed her nuts mixed with milk. put her in a cage with a little pet bottle. and u know that wheel which hamsters spin in? put her in it for her to keep fit!|`|5a1392814d1fe9939dcc302578f81b37aa	An adult Guinea pig will probably bit you if you put it in water. On the other hand if you train a baby they will probably start to enjoy it. make sure the water is not to hot test it with your wrist. Don't use human shampoo buy a product at the pet supplies store. After taking him out make sure he does not get cold and is dry before placing him back in his home. You should clean his cage before giving him a bath. Holding them will make them less skittish. Make sure they have water at all times. Give them a hut of some sort that they can go in and out of, wood chips work the best as bedding but you can always add news paper and scraps of fabric so they can build a nest. make sure you feed them guinea pig pellets they have all the vitamins he'll need and you can always treat him with nuts and dry fruit|`|D4MkXs4eaa	I have 2 guinea pigs and bath them I use a very mild shampoo and don,t have any problems at all but I have been bathing them since they where very young and do handle them a lot. They haven't bitten me once. I feed them fresh lettuce,celery capsicums and apples without seeds.And fresh grass also a good brand of guineapig dry food|`|arpsBMTFaa	My sister bathes her pet Rat, but I would be careful that it will bite you, they don't normally like the water.You can buy a commercial product at pet shop for dry bathing. I wouldn't want to take a risk of getting bitten by one of those things.|`|VdyzwuZraa	You can give your guinea pig a bath but do it only when it is really dirty (long haired piggies get nasty around their butt!).  I use baby wash which you can buy at any grocery/drug store.  It's gentle enough not to harm their skin and it rinses off quickly.  Mine get a bath in the kitchen sink, or if I want to put them all together, in the bath tub.  They love to romp around!  Always wrap the piggie in a nice big towel to soak up the water, gently rub it dry, they love the snuggle part of the whole experience.  Mine don't bite during their bath, they actually love it.  The more you handle them, the more they will become accustom to it and not bite.  The even like going swimming in our pool, but of course we would never put them in alone.<br>  <br>  I've never used a blow dryer on mine, just towel dry them and give them some lap time while they dry off.  It's best not to bathe them during the winter months if it's really cold.  If they get a chill, it will make them sick.  Bottom line: if it stinks, give 'em a bath; use a mild baby wash, wrap them up in a towel to dry and snuggle with them.  They will love you for it!

L1EccMeZaa	You should always feed your cat before administering insulin. If you don't, you risk a hypoglycemia attack which can be deadly. Your cat should eat half an hour before, or at least close to the time of insulin injection. You need to make sure he eats. The food will bring the blood glucose up a bit since insulin can bring it too low, causing hypoglycemia.<br>  <br>  You should also learn to home test if you don't already. A human diabetic would not give themselves insulin without knowing where their blood sugar level was first, and you shouldn't with your cat either. Get a glucometer from the store and learn how to use it. It could save your cat's life.|`|K0uTjeWiaa	It depends on the insulin  and what the glucose number is. For example if you are using humilin N your cat should eat 1/2 hour to 45 minutes before the shot.<br>    You need to learn to home test. It is the only way to know if it is safe to give insulin as well as giving you the info you need to treat this disease correctly. If you want to learn how to take control of this, click on my name, read my profile and get in touch with me. I will work with you every step of the way. The only charge is for you to pay it forward|`|bbc411996e4ce78be28c880823cac5b8aa	Ideally your cat should be fed ~1/2 hour before administering the insulin.  If you administer insulin and your cat does NOT eat, you could cause him to become hypoglycemic, which is an emergency.  <br>  <br>  Signs of hypoglycemia:  sluggishness, ataxia (that means stumbling/appears like he's drunk), seizures and coma<br>  <br>  So, FEED YOUR CAT FIRST!  And make sure he eats!<br>  <br>  And also, try and give the insulin at the same time everyday to better regulate him and make sure he sees the vet regularly for glucose curves and fructosamine levels to make sure that the amount of insulin you are administering remains adequate for controlling your cats diabetes.<br>  <br>  Also, you should keep karo syrup on hand in your fridge when you have a diabetic cat.  If your cat does have a hypoglycemic episode, applying a small amount to your finger and rubbing it on his gums can be helpful in raising his glucose.  But it is NOT a substitute for immediately taking the cat to the vet in a hypoglycemic emergency!!!|`|b3b3292f0a82969ceed4f00b38611bccaa	I'm not sure... but I do know that diabetes can often be CURED by feeding your cat a proper diet. Many cats are no longer insulin dependant once they are fed a species appropriate diet. Considering the diabetes was probably caused by feeding a species inappropriate diet of dry food to the cat for its entire life, a new appropriate diet is a good place to start! <br>  <br>  Here are some good places to start your research. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.catinfo.org/felinediabetes.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catinfo.org/felinediabetes.ht...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://felinediabetes.com/" rel="nofollow">http://felinediabetes.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.yourdiabeticcat.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.yourdiabeticcat.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mypetcarnivore.com/feline_diabetes_mellitus.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mypetcarnivore.com/feline_dia...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.catnutrition.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.catnutrition.org</a>|`|AA11352641	He should eat before the takes the shot.

bDPVRtCNaa	It's best to leave new pets alone for the first few days to allow them time to settle in. <br>  <br>  Hamsters are nocturnal animals and it is completely normal for them to spend the day inside their hide.<br>  <br>  They don't hate you, they aren't used to you. You need to leave them be for now.|`|8kFUqUv9aa	tha r probly jst stil a lil scard cus ur new 2 dem|`|UFn9eMYvaa	No, they don't hate you! You got them from a pet store, right? They just aren't socialized enough. It's called "trust training". It can take a few weeks or months, but eventually they will trust you and not hide. Any kind of new pet is scared at first.
ZdQtNNI9aa	What to feed them, what not to feed them, when they were born, type of hamster, whether or not they can live with other hamsters, how big of a cage they should live in, signs of sickness, necessary toys (wheel, ball - maybe provide the new owners with a chew toy or something), etc. <br>  Good luck!
XDCLL4Oqaa	Yes, you should just chop it off. <br>  <br>  If you don't it will probably just get bigger.<br>  Some places on guinea pigs skin is healthier than others, so the hair grows faster. And this is how these knots are formed. When they rub alnost the ground :) Know i think you should just lift her up while she is eating or somthing. So it's distracted. (When my guinea pigs see sharp of unfamiliar things they freek) So yours doesnt get scared.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|bEQn0Vrtaa	Some guinea pigs simply have long prices of hair on different spots of their bodies, does not hurt a thing. I think it is cute why would you want to cut it. It is like her little finger print. She is a cute one just let hr be and love her.|`|URntCINAaa	It is matted hair. Try and tease the knot out with a grooming brush. Then trim it. If your pig is prone to knots like this, keep the areas around his feet and his bottom trimmed. Be careful when cutting around the bottom area especially if you have a male. If it is male, when cutting, cup the testicles with your hand so not to nip them - VERY painful!|`|9P0ktEbkaa	You look like you have a long haired guinea pig, they are supposed to have long hair, maybe just brush it if it is bothering you. But I think it looks cute.|`|ObbndnaTaa	OMG it's just hair chop it off if u want. It doesn't matter. :)|`|wsLngQ8oaa	I'd trim it. that little bit could get caught on something, I thought you were looking for it's breed.
vejBlTO5aa	Yes I take my favorite rat with me almost everywhere - is that ok to have a fav?? :-)  I keep a scarf around my neck. This gives her a sense of protection as well as warmth. She only comes out if SHE wants to (which is pretty often). Not only does she have fun, but I believe it helps educate the public about what nice pets they are.|`|k6UI5Z2jaa	I have taken my two pet rats for walks on rat harnesses for about a week now. We have a small, new field where I walk them when I can. They love the fresh air, and because the leads are relatively short, if a dog or other 'danger' comes nearby, it takes less than two second to scoop them up and let them play in my pockets.<br>  <br>  It's so funny to see people faces when I walk past with two rats. xD|`|tDP6ru3oaa	No because my rat is young and not fully trained yet. But when she's trained, comes when she's called, and sits on my shoulder. Then I might bring her places. =D|`|BWez86Ldaa	Not usually, but our three newest babies will go to our friend's house with us. Our friend just LOVES the ratties, as he's pretty much the rats' godfather so to speak lol :P|`|UlOKMInqaa	I have three females who are always on the go. They would much rather be running around exploring things than hanging out on my shoulder or having me hold them.

You're lucky to have such a loving rat!|`|rVUCTz3Taa	No i dont take my rats anywhere and i dont kno any ppl that do... But i think its awesome you take your rat out to places, he probably has alot of fun going with you =)|`|17ovKbITaa	Yes quite often, my first rat used to sit in our pockets whilst we would go for a walk, she would love sniffing the fresh air as we walked along.<br>  <br>  I quite often take our rats that we have now out with us, although there is one that we cannot take with us as she does anything to escape, even at home she will go places she is not allowed!!<br>  <br>  They also like going for a drive in the car as well, i think they like to feeling, they get all excited!!<br>  <br>  Wow thats cool that you do it too, we always get funny looks when we walk around with her on our shoulders!|`|XurYYreBaa	Yes, we often bring 1 or 2 or our rats with us to animal-friendly places.  The rats *love* it & people are always commenting on how well-behaved our little guys are.<br>  Last summer we brought 2 of our girls to church for a Celebration of Companion Animals.  They had a blast.<br>  As you know, each rat has a unique personality.  We'd never bring a newly adopted, nervous or sick rat on our mini "road trips," just our adventurous attention-hogs.|`|JmD0oq2Naa	id love to take one of my rats out with me, but im terrified he will get spooked and run off

YpEswTQdaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  If you don't take it away it will go off & become smelly & disgusting. Hens do become 'Broody' when they feel the urge to sit on eggs,although some hens will just sit in an EMPTY nestbox! She doesn't know its unfertile. Just remove it,broody hens loose condition,especially if no chicks come out in the end! She may sit on it for up to 6wks,by then the egg would of gone VERY off! Here is a picture of my Broody hens,i didn't put them like this:<a href="http://i111.piczo.com/view/3/l/b/p/c/1/6/8/i/a/o/h/img/i254470499_50055_2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i111.piczo.com/view/3/l/b/p/c/1/6...</a> One hen was sat broody on the Perch! Silly billies.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,xxx|`|zzzd9tC4aa	Your hen is broody. This means she will sit on any eggs she lays. Just stick your hand under her to get them out, she might peck you though. If she carry's on being broody and you want her to stop, put her in a cage that has railings all round and on the bottom. This will make it unpleasant for her to sit down, so she won't want to. If you think this is too harsh, put some straw in for her to sit on. Keep her in the cage for about 2 days,day and night. This will make her not want to be broody.|`|yXUS7jz5aa	Place your hand under this chook(she might want to peck you,it doesn't hurt!)And remove the egg.You cant leave it there as it will go off.This wont upset the chook.|`|rQlzfHqraa	Just take the egg  and she will go on with life and probably lay more. Do you like scrambled eggs?
dhljEfddaa	Just keep trying. It takes quite some time for them to get use to being held a lot. Take her out every day for about 20 mins and just play with her. After a few weeks it should be completely use to you and will probably fall asleep!|`|fBMSIlSIaa	Thats cute I wish my hamster would do that but shes very active!|`|HQssYZ8taa	:) i remember when my hamster used to do that. First, you need a quiet place to be. I would take my hamster out, put her in my hands, and lay down on my bed. Then put her on your stomach, cup your hands around its body (like a roof, or if it was in its cage, and it was sleeping under the bedding) so yeah, then just wait. When you cup your hands abover her like a roof, she feels like she is sleeping in her cage.

5e73ab0cf115332330869a0e12f543bfaa	It's impossible to tell without a picture.  Even then it's difficult.  If they are 4 months of age or older they will pretty much look exactly the same.  If they are younger than 4 months it can be estimated by somebody who is familiar with mice, but without a picture I can't really tell you anything.  If I had to guess I would assume they are around 2-3 months old, since most mice in pet stores are sold for snake food and don't last long in the store.  Good luck with your mice!|`|SLlOYdXtaa	Cut them open and count the rings on the inside, like how to tell the age of trees.|`|jYwswF7Zaa	cook it, if the meat is tender then its a young mouse.if the meat is tough then its an old mouse.

TSc8OE4vaa	You tend to "pump" with your seat on the flat.  Keep your seat still at the canter, you're pumping back and forth, it's much better to sit back and be still as you can communicate with your pony more effectively.<br>  <br>  You really didn't give any release over the jump.  I actually had to watch twice to see where the jump was because it's not in screen.  You need to come forward more with your body over the jump and give the pony a bit more of his head.<br>  <br>  You need to stay out of the saddle more!  You hardly got into 2-point at all.  You need to stay in 2-point for a stride or two after the jump.<br>  <br>  You also could stand to shorten your stirrups by about 2 holes.  Your knee should form a 110 degree angle when you are over the jump, your stirrups are way too long to do this with!<br>  <br>  I like your eyes over the jump, though!  Looking down is a classic mistake beginners make and you don't seem to be doing that, so good job!  <br>  <br>  You also hold your hands well on the flat before and after the jump, just bring them up into 2-point over it,|`|gFVy4r1eaa	Try to dig deeper into your heels and avoid letting your leg slip back while you're in the air. Really think about pushing your leg forward as you approach and ride the jump. It's a subtle issue over this small jump but the problem will get worse and more noticeable as the height increases if it's not corrected.|`|AlrCZJ3saa	Looks good so far, just practice
3cL7XphAaa	Right.<br>  <br>  1. I personally find that dutch rabbits are gorgeous- especially for the beginner as they are a friendly, easy to groom, pretty rabbit breed.<br>  <br>  2. The best brand of rabbit food is either 'selective' or burgess 'excel' pellets. The pellets are better than the mixed grain, as they can't pick out the nice bits and leave the healthy bits.<br>  <br>  3. Rabbits originally come from the Caribbean so banana is an excellent source of potassium that they really love! They also will eat cabbage, cauliflower, carrot, small amount of apple, cucumber, basically- most vegetables that aren't too acidic.<br>  <br>  4. NO POTATO, NO LETTUCE, NO SWEETS, NO GARDEN PLANTS =)<br>  <br>  5. Dutch rabbits live 8- 12 years, but have lived longer.<br>  <br>  6. What ever you do, don't buy one from a pet shop. They usually come from a bad background and you can never tell if they were the runt of the litter. Go into the country and find a little nice looking small holding and see about rabbits there. You could also look for breeders in your area- but make sure they have a good reputation.<br>  <br>  7. Usually a dutch costs ￡12 at a small holding or up to ￡40 at a pet shop<br>  <br>  8. Get the biggest most complicated hutch you can find/ afford. My rabbits live in our wendy house in the winter because it is warmer! My male rabbits live in a three story hutch with toys and the down stairs extends out into a run on the  grass.  <br>  <br>  Here a list of all you need:<br>  <br>  - A MASSIVE hutch<br>  - Millions of toys, chews and food filled games<br>  - Two water bottles (one for in case you forget to fill the other up)<br>  - A ceramic food bowl<br>  - Wood shavings (to line the floor of the hutch)<br>  - Straw (bedding)<br>  - Hay (food)<br>  - Pellet food<br>  - Fresh vegetables<br>  - A dustpan to scoop up the dirty bedding (and poop)<br>  - Animal safe disinfectant spray<br>  - Mineral lick<br>  - Salt lick<br>  - Water and frost proof hutch cover<br>  - LOVE AND TIME!!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://stores.channeladvisor.com/The-Rabbit-Hutch-Shop/Items/SDH44?&caSKU=SDH44&caTitle=4ft%20Drop%20Hutch%20and%20Run%20With%204%20x%204%20Run" rel="nofollow">http://stores.channeladvisor.com/The-Rab...</a> <br>  <br>  9. When you buy EVERY thing, It should be ￡200 at least for a basic set up. You don't want to start with not every thing you need, so its best to save up for a bit longer and give your new pet the best start it can have. Then plus the rabbit, spaying and vaccinations- your looking at around ￡320. But from then its only about ￡6 a month for bedding a food- so its not too bad!<br>  <br>  10. To be really honest, I don't buy treats. I give them vegetables twice week, which acts as a treat, because if you have a good food, they don't NEED the vegetables that much. Its cheaper too!<br>  <br>  11. Don't bother with alfalfa, its pointless. As long as they get fresh hay each day in a lifted hay rack.<br>  <br>  12. You should spay/ neuter your rabbit to prevent testicular and cervical cancer- these are common in rabbits.<br>  <br>  13. They also should be vaccinated- the diseases they get are... horrible. Believe me.<br>  <br>  14. They should have a run to exercise on the grass each day for at least 1 hour. <br>  <br>  15. If you are only getting one, you need to make sure you will have time to give him/ her all the attention you can possibly offer. Rabbits get lonely and depressed with out company as they naturally have lots of company in the wild. <br>  <br>  16. Cleaning- They stink when not cleaned. She/he should be totally cleaned out and the cage disinfected every 3 days. Its so cruel not to.<br>  <br>  Well good luck and if you need any help feel free to add me as a email buddy! <br>  <br>  Have fun<br>  <br>  x|`|yaC7JPt4aa	I'm sorry this isn't a very good answer, but you should get a few good books on them because this website isn't very accurate.<br>  <br>  Also, rabbits aren't rodents, they are part of a family called  lagomorphs

He was a handraised baby and talks pretty well.  Anyone can tell he says Step Up, then u can hear peakaboo, and he laughs perfect (and has awesome timing with it) he also wolf whisles and beeps like my answering machine.  Bad to admit but my hubby is a hard charging paratrooper and has taugh him to say "I Kill U" like comic Jeff Duhamn terrorist manquien.  The man is working on teaching him to wear a birdie acu and ride a remote controlled desert humvee toy too. (Rolls eyes) But that said he's very smart and trainable, as most conures seem to be.  Any of the bird breeds u mention would prolly be fine as long as it's been hand raised.  Read about the different breeds and species and weigh the pros and cons.  For example my conure is loud, i'm just lucky he likes to talk as well (not all of them do) otherwise he would just be a very loud bird.  As for liking water my nanday pretends he's a duck, he's got a water dish his size and he gets in and swims (i bought it so he could get in and still get out, because birds can drown, they sink when their feathers get wet).  He bathes almost daily.  Good luck on finding a forever feathered friend.  They'll hopefully be around between twenty and thirty years.<br>  <br>  Edit:  not all the conures are lound, some are very quiet, the nanday is considered the most lound so that's why mine is loud.  I know the peach front is small and quiet and tend to have the same big parrot personality.|`|o3nNm1iAaa	Hi!<br>  <br>  Sounds like a cockatiel would be the right bird for you! They are one of my favorites. They are 45-100 dollars. They get attached to only one person at a time. They are twice the size of a parakeet and get along with them. Cockatiels can get obsesive if they get attached to you. <br>  <br>  Cockatiels are:<br>  <br>  - cuddly <br>  - pretty<br>  - funny<br>  - medium size<br>  - personaity<br>  - not so noisy( female)<br>  - likes toys<br>  - gets along with parakeets<br>  - active <br>  -likes water<br>  <br>  <br>   not to expencive <br>  - somthing that is very affectionete and cuddly <br>  -they trust you if they get attached to you<br>  -learn lots of tricks.<br>  <br>  I own a cockatiel, she is one of the best birds i ever had! Cockatiels are just like dogs, they are nice, playful, sweet, can make you feel good if your in a bad mood, and they put so much love in your heart!<br>  <br>  I almost forgot... This is what cockatiels look like:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=cockatiels&gbv=2&aq=f&oq=" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=...</a><br>  <br>  They are a good first time bird. I hope you find the right bird! Good luck!|`|PWxa4ek7aa	The perfect bird for you is a Cockatiel.  I recommend either the Cinnamon or the Lutino ones.  I DO NOT recommend the Conure for you because they are at the least expensive $400.  Unless you don't mind spending that much on one, a Conure is second.

NBfBKI1Uaa	Silver Shark also known as Bala Shark are very peaceful and will not eat your guppies or you catfish unlike someone has suggested.<br>  <br>  But they Silver shark require huge tank and need to be in school of at least 6.  The minimum requirement for at least one of then is around 75 gallons since they grow to about 12 to 13 inches.<br>  <br>  There are number of catfishes and they can all coexist with the guppies without any problem. Again some catfish require larger tanks while some can survive in smaller one.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  -rds|`|7kCeVLNlaa	I had some Silver Shark in my tank which is 110 litres and they got way to big for it. They are not very aggressive though and I had no problems. Although you will need a tank of about 800 litres, for the simple reason that they need 75 gallons each and you need at least 6. The guppies are peaceful and so are most catfish. <br>  But unless you have a big enough tank I would advise against the Silver Sharks.<br>  Best of Luck|`|VLy1yqI2aa	I've had a silver shark, 3 guppsys, and 2 coryadas together all at once. My silver shark has NEVER tried to eat my guppys, but the silver shark is quiite small for a silver shark. But i've had angle fish (THEY ARE HUGE) with neons, and they don't touch them!<br>  <br>  hope i helped :D|`|JvTF7UrMaa	well yeah i suppose in theory but you would have to have at least a 250 litre tank because of the silver shark they grow huge like plec, and when the silver shark reaches a certain size it will try to eat our guppies as they do not grow very big.|`|CyOTk9JOaa	once your shark get bigger they will eat your guppies, and depends what. type of cat fish you would like, some may live happy with guppies,but some would eat them too, the same with silver sharks- some will eat them and some breeds will live happy.|`|hQQuqyYcaa	Silver sharks will eventually eat the guppies. Also, what kind of catfish? Corycats do well with guppies, but anything larger can possibly eat the guppies, too.|`|AA11708471	silver sharks grow big and could eat a guppy<br>  <br>  as for the catfish it depends what  sort<br>  <br>  also how big is the tank
Eyawiwc5aa	Some things to try ... they don't always work w/ every iguana because every iguana is different:<br>  If it is a young ig, rest your palm at the edge of the tank, place your hand inside the tank for 5mins a day 1-3times if possible ... your ig will freak out but he/she will get used to it<br>  Igs usually relax after a few mins of holding the first few months<br>  Give your ig head rubs, body rubs, chin rubs<br>  Offer a some collard, mustard or slices of strawberries, canalope after bath time, at first he/she may not take any from your fingers but in time he/she may<br>  Bonding time after bath time was the best for me<br>  Hold your ig for at least 10-15mins a day, again he/she may freak out for the first few mins ... taking into a room that is safe and quite will also help<br>  All 3 main ig sites listed below do have some type of taming and socializing info, please do take a look at them and do read them, they will offer great advise also<br>  <br>  Sites for you to read:<br>  <a href="http://www.greenigsociety.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.greenigsociety.org/</a> - <a href="http://www.iguanaden.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.iguanaden.org/</a> - <a href="http://www.anapsid.org/iguana/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.anapsid.org/iguana/index.html</a><br>  A great book to read and have on hand:<br>  Iguanas for Dummies by Melissa Kaplan<br>  Yahoo has some great sites for Iguana owners... these groups helped me and still help w/ questions .. if you'd like to join:<br>  <a href="http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/BabyIguana/">http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/BabyI...</a> - <a href="http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/IguanaDen/">http://pets.groups.yahoo.com/group/Iguan...</a>|`|wZKb8egaaa	Daily handling, teaching it voice commands (no, stop etc.). Repetition, and constancy. I always compare iguanas to cats because they have so much a like as far as attitude and taming. You can litter box train an iguana and a cat, but if they don't like being handled then they wont let you handle them. They are very stubborn and like the first poster said can dislike humans after any small event. But that depends on your iguana. I only hold mine 2-3 times a week and he does great. He seems to like me so he doesn't fight too much and he loves the sound of women talking so he likes to be out when we have guest.<br>  <br>  So it depends. They CAN be tamed with time. Some tame faster then others, and some never tame. It takes time, and don't try to change your routine too much. Iguanas do not like change.<br>  <br>  Check out this site on behavior and things to look out for. It should help out with training. Also check out the book called, "Iguanas For Dummies"<br>  <a href="http://www.todaysplanet.com/pg/beta/lizardlover/page3.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.todaysplanet.com/pg/beta/liza...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Iguanas-Dummies-Melissa-Kaplan/dp/0764552600/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1236503071&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Iguanas-Dummies-Me...</a>|`|hQQuqyYcaa	With an iguana, you need to handle it each and every day. <br>  My friend used to have a 6ft iguana that he handled each day since it was a baby (he didn't even go on vacation). He then had to leave for the weekend to go to a funeral. Came back and it's as if the iguana didn't even recognize him. After that, the iguana was difficult to handle and he had to pretty much try taming it out all over again. <br>  And this isn't the only story I've heard about iguanas. They can be hard to tame "completely" most of the time.<br>  You can also try placing an old shirt that has your smell on it inside the terrarium. Usually this works with snakes, but give it a try.
2cuV3Koyaa	I am sure she will have her puppies just about anywhere that she feels is a safe place. Leave her to get on with the birth where ever she feels the most comfy, you can always move them when you checked them over later, after she has finished giving birth.<br>  <br>  There is no reason for her not to be able to have them upstairs if that is the most quietest place, as long as she doesn't feel her puppies are in any danger she should be quite happy to leave them while she has a toilet break.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps and good luck xx
K0tpQoHRaa	they will just need to get used to one another by placing them in seperate cages near each other in visual contact not phisical to assure that both are friendly and social. no they will get along just fine mine do .they like to chase each other. and yes they are easy to teach just start off with somethiong simple like (hello,how are you) though males are better at pronouncing the words then hens females are easy learners too.females just have a less advanced vocal ability but dont learn any less or slower than males no matter what others may say females are just as intelligent.|`|cpxkROqMaa	Yes, they could fight. It is best to put them in two cages and place the cages next to each other. Once they are use to each other try putting them in the same cage.|`|GBwBwH5iaa	the cockatiel could hurt the budgie. So if you really want a cockatiel I suggest you keep them separate. Male birds are always friendlier and have more ability to talk.|`|bqj9aqhWaa	this morning i went to the vet to get another budgie and a also wanted a cocktail i asked the manger and he said that cocktails are very territorial if a budgie was in the same cage the budgie might die=(<br>  <br>                                                                        even if they're in seperate cages they will be chirping and fighting all night to get to each other.|`|bU2TrMxgaa	It's never good to keep birds of different sizes in the same cage. No matter how well you think they get along.
SOxdyWQOaa	could be the dojo that is doing it <br>  <br>  <br>  18 years experience with fish|`|rrLHU6ehaa	I don't think any of those fish would normally attack your guppies.  The dojo might, depending on the size, but again, not normally if otherwise well fed.<br>  I suggest looking for another cause.  If they died for other reasons, the snails would finish them off.|`|ur5wDhkMaa	Agree with Top, there's plenty in there that would remove a body, but no obvious killer.<br>  <br>  Disease in the guppy population is something you should look at.|`|gzI4wANvaa	i think it is the dojo to because guppies probally look like  tasty treats
stCyrS4Eaa	Yes, there have been studies done on this. I saw a wonderful program on channel 11, or something similar.<br>  <br>  They don't know time as in clock time. They have the ability to know within 15 minutes of when you come home from work, if you are on a consistent schedule. It has something to do with the sun, even though they may not be able to see the sun through the window. It was the coolest program. I wish I could find the link.<br>  <br>  Have you ever noticed that on your days off, when you want to sleep in, your dog wants his breakfast at the same time as when you wake up early for work? This is an innate ability they were born with. They also know what time you are normally in bed, and get restless when you stay up later on the weekends.<br>  <br>  They have an internal clock and tests have proven it to a closeness of 15 minutes!|`|4wRVxL6Xaa	If you are consistent with your dog, they can tell time.. My dog wakes me up at 7 for work every morning and knows when I get home at night. They even remind me that it's time for their dinner sometimes.. <br>  <br>  My dog always wakes me up at 6:55 to 7:10 so it's pretty cool.|`|bIaywrBCaa	yes, they have a sense of time. They know when it is time to go to bed, to get up. My dogs know when it is time for Daddy to come home. They have their own internal clock. It is more a matter of habit I guess but they are aware.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	Dogs do not have a concept of time in the sense that they do not know the difference between 1 hour or 10 hours. They do have a concept of time in that they know that certain things happen at certain times of the day. But, this is more an observation of human behavior at certain times of day than it is a dog innately knowing that certain things happen at certain times of day.|`|GSf09ALBaa	I would say yes.  My dogs know what time I get up in the morning and when it is the weekend, they still let me know it's time to "get up".  They also know when me, my husband and daughter get home.  So, I would say they are very aware of time.<br>  <br>  They are also intuned to sounds.  My truck has duel exhaust and has a certain rumble different from other trucks.  Most of my dogs can hear me coming from a block away.  Right as a turn the corner at the 4 way stop, they start.  <br>  <br>  So, sounds, time and many other things.  Dogs are very aware.|`|AA10894901	When you do things with your dog on a regular basis, feeding walking, etc. certainly, they become aware of the times they are due.|`|auUeI2Vnaa	Yup, they are aware of morning time, eating time and sleeping time. lol.|`|qENyQSnNaa	There's no doubt in my mind that dogs don't read the clock---BUT---<br>  everyday the sun starts from the east, and goes to the west, and, when it gets to a certain point, you're coming through that door.  So he's right there waiting for you.<br>  If that's not what you were getting at, I am sure that it will help you understand anyway.|`|EeJMITyCaa	Yes, dogs are aware of time. They sleep at night and do their other activities during the day so it is important for them to be able to know when it is night time and when it is day time. They do know when its 1:15 pm but they do understand day from night.|`|tY14vbrKaa	Dogs know, based on your behavior, that it's time to go out, time to eat dinner, time to go to bed, etc...  They know when they feel hungry, sleepy, and tired.  I'm pretty sure five hours or five minutes feels much the same in the canine world.|`|jmlAmr3gaa	Yes, of course they do. How else would they know when to stop running before they hit a wall etc.?  Other mammals don't use multiple tools together at the same time, don't speak in very complex languages, and don't solve complex puzzles.  Apart from that, they're a lot like us.|`|Mcf33eLbaa	Just be at my house about a half hour before breakfast or dinner time for the dogs.<br>  They`ll start letting you know what time it is alright, lol.<br>  Good Luck and God Bless|`|FJZIvANFaa	Im not quite sure if dogs can read clocks lmao.|`|AA11244754	no, they have no concept of time|`|hoAeWwJDaa	Yes. They are instinctively and naturally aware of time. Seasonal cycles, lunar rhythms, day and night duration, tidal cycles (for dogs on the coast), their body's circadian rhythm and solar orientation all affect their perception of time, their daily schedule and activities, their behavior. Their behavior can alter dramatically when their environment changes suddenly and greatly, such as a new and different location, or a change in their owner, family, or routine/schedule. Such as moving from the western hemisphere to the eastern hemisphere, or from Florida to Alaska, or suddenly their owner works 3rd shift, feeds and walks them at 10pm and 8am instead of 6am and 6pm. Breeding "season" initiates when day lengths have gradually changed during preceding months, and is stimulated by solar orientation, daylight and nighttime exposure, and lunar rhythms. All mammals experience a daily awareness of time, as their organs and cells operate on a daily "schedule" and rhythm (aka circadian rhythm). Artificial light exposure (instead of sunlight) can affect their (our) biological clocks, changing the rhythms and patterns.|`|Ry3JbhUsaa	I don't know about being aware of time per-se, but once I had an office job with steady hours, my Cocker Spaniel would always start looking for me (from what my parents said) just before I was supposed to get home from work.  When I started going to school right after work, they said he would get increasingly agitated - whining, pacing, etc, watching for mommy to get hom.  If nothing else, they have a heck of an internal clock.|`|WWhYCAbSaa	No.  They learn after a while that when the sun goes down, everyone in the house goes to bed.<br>  <br>  As for getting people up for work, what's really going on is the dog has to go potty badly and wakes you up for that.<br>  <br>  Wild dogs are out all hours of the day and night.|`|1G6pYowKaa	i think they know that time has passed but i think an hour and 5 hours feels about the same to them. whenever i leave my dog regardless of whether its an hour or 10 she reacts the same way when i return. Im away at school now and she greets me the same way when she sees me when i come home now as she does when im gone for the day.|`|rzR0W7aTaa	no (normal) dogs don't know time.<br>  but its were the sun is in the sky, is what they normally look out for.<br>  or they're use to when they get fed or let out. <br>  i feed my dogs at the same time every day and they're use to it. <br>  <br>  hope that helps =]|`|WNsjy5oFaa	i dont think so - i think they follow your routine so if your up and about all day and sleep all night so will they, but they definately get used to certain regular times such as meal times, going out, walking time, etc but probably only because they are better at observing our behaviours and routines than we are|`|3CSoSRmtaa	Absolutely,  just like humans.  Dogs have internal clocks.  Dogs do sleep during the night and exercise their energy during the day time.|`|7Chzjhuxaa	Well im pretty sure dogs don't understand the concept of time things like hours and minutes but my dog knows exactly when his dad comes home and waits for him within like five minutes. And he waits outside his room every morn at the same time|`|EgfL2c86aa	no. they have no concept of time. that's why when you leave for like 10 minutes and come back home, they're still excited to see you.|`|eZ5rWB5Yaa	I don't think they can tell time, but I believe my puppy KNOWS when it is 7:30 P.M. because she lets me know it is.    That is when I give her a nightly snack of doggy treats. :)|`|kSZstQ6Paa	Yes they know time Cause my dog goes to bed at 8:00 PM<br>  And he wants to!|`|vOODVZbNaa	yes...if u feed your dog around 6 o' clock each day they will come to u looking for it if u have forgotten...they always know when it's time to eat anyway!LOL!|`|ho2hEqo8aa	only if they have a timex|`|ACVUcKzCaa	yes,|`|JbrJgJGjaa	of course! :)
342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	No one can diagnose your dog over the internet, but her vet can.  All you have to do is take her in to see him.  Older dogs need to see their vet twice a year for a health check anyway and if your dog isn't acting right, she needs to be taken in now.  That's the least you owe her after 13 years.|`|KxjUim7yaa	She may have some health problems. Take her to the vet for a physical.|`|24CFl7sjaa	As her activity levels decrease her appetite will too, or rather her need to consume as many calories will.

If you are really worriered go see a vet. I'm sure they'll tell you the same.|`|xkzkCtrUaa	She is getting old..Not dying. When I clicked on this is thought it was an emergency..|`|BY0cV4kRaa	Take her to the vet for a check up.|`|lvpBedrvaa	She is fine but you need to call the vet if <br>  she stops eating and drinking.!<br>  she just needs to go on special dog food <br>  senior dog food.(It has special vi teams in the food.)|`|iaoZtValaa	I don't think so. My dog is less active too because she's really old and she doesn't eat much but she's okay. I mean she's been like this for years and she still alive!|`|FPGgaI3Yaa	no shes not dying, its called shes tired because her boyfriend dog came over last night and shes not drinking or eating because shes full|`|UZodNAOkaa	shes ok shes just aging as dogs age they don't need much food and water and are'nt as active

vFRslsv7aa	yes german Shepard are bred to be guard dogs so if each other don't get along both could attack and dont worry the about the girl being more aggressive its normal so separate them if, you dont they might get hurt|`|BtoCr1yFaa	German Shepherds are bred to be VERY aggressive, and it could get dangerous. You need to seperate the dogs NOW because they obviously do not get along.|`|N60Vl5DYaa	Hi! how old are your dogs? how long have they been together? If they are young and just meeting then this is a dominance thing and it will work itself out.Male dogs are automatically submissive to females anyways so that may be why you think the female is aggressive.I have 2 females myself and they get along great.I mean they play fight and stuff but would never hurt each other. Good Luck!
um5CVvTfaa	Then she isn't ready to be mated.  Maybe she doesn't like him--|`|bZhIEy1Waa	Then don't mate them - she doesn't like him and it would be morally wrong to push the issue - in my eyes its akin to rape! She's made it very clear she doesn't want to mate with him so find another dog, one that she gets along with and likes, it makes for a less traumatic mating on her part!|`|9fdb1aec1eec12317a40aebc48023ffbaa	If she does not allow it she is not in heat yet. He may not be doing it for breeding reasons as much for a dominant behavior.

Scratch that. Reverse it. I was tired when I wrote that, sorry.|`|91Ml3TpPaa	She isn't in heat yet.  You have to wait until she goes into heat.  Bit*hes aren't like humans, they can't get turned on from foreplay alone.  They have to go into heat first, it's a hormone thing.  <br>  <br>  She won't even get pregnant from artificial insemination unless she is in heat, because unless she is in heat, she won't ovulate.  No ovulation means no egg.  And no egg means no puppies.|`|JtZfTiEEaa	Then you gon't get puppies!|`|MoRMNVMXaa	Respect her wishes!|`|vFRslsv7aa	simple answer the female isnt ready to mate yet, it has to go throw heat first to be interested or ready to mate
bZhIEy1Waa	It all depends on the breed and the size really although most dogs will stop teething around 5 months! She's experiencing exactly the same things as a human baby, the high temperature, the hot cheeks, the very sore gums, maybe the runs, being misreable and snappy, sad eh? Made even sadder because she can't tell you! You can rub some baby formula Bonjela ( a numbing gel for teething human babies ) on her gums plus give her ice cubes to suck - mine loved them when they were going through the agonys of teething, they still love them now in fact when the weathers very hot! Teething doesn't last forever, she's almost over it and you'll be finding her little gnashers all over the place ha ha. She can't help biting things, it does help with the pain and discomfort but try the ice cubes - they were a god send to me and mine. Good luck.|`|um5CVvTfaa	The teething hasn't begun yet.  She will start to lose her baby teeth soon.|`|Cfk1kr8Daa	You can soak and freeze nylaropes for her, and conversely, spray stuff you don't want her to chew (like woodwork) with Bitter Apple.  <br>  <br>    Get a small spray bottle and some icky yellow Listerine to spray on your hands, so you don't have to endure the Bitter Apple - it really does taste terrible!<br>  <br>    I hope you're crating this puppy - that is the only surefire way to keep them safe when you're not directly surpervising them|`|MuD5oXQQaa	Your dog isn't necessarily displaying teething behavior.

uHApHSB4aa	Il cane, che discende dal lupo (canis lupus), è il più vecchio Animale domestico dell'uomo. Animale da branco, il cane riuscì a inserirsi nella società umana più di ogni altro animale. Se si prende in considerazione l'area dell'Eurasia in cui il lupo si diffuse, si può supporre che il suo addomesticamento avvenne in diversi luoghi nell'Europa orientale e occidentale. I primi ritrovamenti di ossa che testimoniano la presenza del lupo ammansito, poi addomesticato risalgono alla fine dell'era glaciale (18'000-15'000 a.C.). Le più antiche ossa di cane rinvenute sull'attuale territorio elvetico risalgono al 13'000 a.C. ca. e provengono dalla stazione archeologica a cielo aperto di Hauterive-Champréveyres, sul lago di Neuchatel, risalente al Magdaleniano. Sebbene in Europa a partire dall'inizio dell'età postglaciale si sia verificato un netto aumento della presenza del cane, nelle stazioni mesolitiche sviz. non è stata finora rinvenuta alcuna traccia dell'animale. Fra i resti di ossa venuti alla luce nei siti del Neolitico, quelli di cane sono per contro regolarmente presenti. La ricostruzione degli alberi genealogici delle moderne razze canine in base ai ritrovamenti di ossa preistoriche - sistema adottato in passato dalla ricerca scientifica - è altrettanto superata quanto la classificazione delle stesse ossa secondo le diverse razze. Soltanto la denominazione di cane delle torbiere (o della torba, canis familiaris palustris) viene ancora utilizzata occasionalmente per descrivere un tipo di cane piccolo o di media grandezza (altezza al garrese di 33-55 cm, baricentro a 41-47 cm), dal cranio lupoide, diffuso in maniera uniforme nei villaggi lacustri neolitici dei Paesi alpini.<br>  <br>  Fino all'età moderna inoltrata l'allevamento e il mantenimento dei cani dipendeva soprattutto dal loro utilizzo. Già gli autori dell'antichità operavano una distinzione fra cani da caccia, da guardia e da pastore, e ne descrivevano il comportamento, la fedeltà e l'intelligenza. A seconda dell'utilizzo, particolari aspetti caratteriali, una determinata colorazione del manto o costituzione risultavano più idonei allo scopo: mentre il cane da caccia o da pastore doveva essere preferibilmente di costituzione leggera e di colore chiaro, per meglio distinguerlo dalla selvaggina, o pezzato, quello da guardia doveva essere robusto e di colore scuro per incutere più timore. Dalla tarda età del Ferro comparvero anche cani piccoli, con un'altezza al garrese inferiore ai 30 cm, che vanno considerati come cani da compagnia dei ceti privilegiati. I cani più grossi raggiungevano un'altezza al garrese superiore ai 60 cm (Augusta Raurica)<br>  <br>  |`|QkECtOUNaa	quando i genitori dei cani hanno rapporti sessuali....nn stanno molto attenti eeh........|`|74emKzXYaa	I più recenti studi basati sulla genetica, supportati dagli approfondimenti paleontologici, hanno portato a ritenere valido il riconoscimento del lupo grigio (Canis lupus) come progenitore del cane domestico, riconosciuto come sottospecie (Canis lupus familiaris). Ancora incerte sono le ipotesi sul processo di domesticazione. Una delle ipotesi più accreditate è quella dei coniugi Ray e Lorna Coppinger, biologi, che propongono la teoria di un "domesticamento naturale" del lupo, una selezione naturale di soggetti meno abili nella caccia, ma al contempo meno timorosi nei confronti dell'uomo, che avrebbero cominciato a seguire i primi gruppi di cacciatori nomadi, nutrendosi dei resti dei loro pasti, ma fornendo inconsapevolmente un prezioso servizio di "sentinelle", stabilendosi in seguito nei pressi dei primi insediamenti, e dando il via ad una sorprendente coabitazione tra due specie di predatori, con reciproci vantaggi.<br>  |`|DI8siNCnaa	incroci tra lupi  e gatti!!!<br>  oppure tra gatti e topini!

5RRMLzvzaa	what's ultimately important is that your cat eats.  If it won't eat the renal food, just feed it whatever it will eat.

What you want to look for is not a dry food, but a wet food. Contrary to popular belief wet/canned food is actually healthiest for cats.<br>  <br>  The reason is, in the wild, cats normally get most of their water content directly from their prey items and drink very little. Domestic cats are no different, and because of the fact that they are designed to take in water with their meal, they have a very low thirst drive. Cats often just don't drink enough. This leads to urinary tract infections and crystals. The bit about dry food being better for teeth is a myth and has not been proven in the least (cats barely even chew their dry food and, really, does a pretzel clean /your/ teeth? Cats should have their teeth brushed with cat toothbrushes and cat toothpaste at least a few times a week as well as see the vet for dental cleanings when necessary /regardless/ of what they are being fed). Canned/wet food is better because it more closely mimics the cat's natural diet.

Cats tend to like to drink from running water and cat fountains see to that need, encouraging cats to take in more water.<br>  <br>  In my country, Royal Canin, Purina, and Hill's are all considered low quality cat foods by those of us who have educated ourselves on cat nutrition.<br>  <br>  Here are some foods that I would consider high quality: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Felidae, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timber Wolf Organics.<br>  <br>  I don't know if you will be able to find any of them in Belgium, though.

This diet is designed to reduce the amount of waste materials in the system that must be filtered out by the kidneys. The low salt and low phosphorous help control the electrolyte imbalances that are common with CRF. While there is no cure for CRF, this diet may slow the progression of the disease.* CRF cats sometimes have a difficult time eating any foods because they tend to secrete excess stomach acids. Since these foods are often less palatable than the commercial foods, you must be patient and persistent in your efforts to get your cat to eat the prescribed diet.<br>  <br>  Some cats may eat some or all of these foods, but many cats absolutely refuse to eat any. DO NOT starve the cat. If a cat doesn't want to eat, it WON'T. Remember that it's most important for them to keep food intake and body weight up. When introducing a new low protein diet, start by gradually increasing the new food and decreasing the old. This procedure could take anywhere from a week to a month depending on how finicky your cat is. If your cat doesn't like a dry version of the new diet, try the canned and vice versa.

The roof that can lift up has really poor hardware that tends to break off and split the wood, too.|`|RxBe4y3Waa	i love this one, my husband and i were looking at them recently we both thought this one was cool. i have an indoor bunny cage, 2 stories. and an outdoor cedar hutch similar to this one but not as cool.<br>  this is what the outdoor one looks like:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ukpetsonline.com/detail.aspx?ID=416" rel="nofollow">http://ukpetsonline.com/detail.aspx?ID=4...</a><br>  <br>  this is what our indoor cage looks like (ours is a little bigger):<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drsfostersmith.com/product/prod_display.cfm?c=17342+17345+17371&pcatid=17371" rel="nofollow">http://www.drsfostersmith.com/product/pr...</a><br>  <br>  our bunnies love their condo and hutch.|`|FfBll2n8aa	I was given one of these. My rabbits enjoyed chewing it so much that after less than two months, the floor fell out when they chewed completely through the wood!! <br>  Also, unless you let your rabbits out every day to exercise, your rabbits will get very little exercise in this cage - they need large/long flat surfaces to run on - going up and down a ramp a couple of times a day does nothing for their physical wellbeing.<br>  As nice as these cages look, they are cheaply made, are very hard to clean, the rabbits will chew it to bits very quickly, the sleeping quarters are too small and only have one door, and they are poorly designed when the physical requirements of a rabbit are taken into account. <br>  I get a handy man to make my hutches - they are nice and long for running space and have a high ceiling so the rabbits can sit up straight and look around. Also, the nesting box area is large, and has TWO doors on it - rabbits will often refuse to sleep in a box with only one door, as it's against their instincts to be "trapped" in an enclosed space with only one exit.<br>  Save your money and get either a regular hutch, or, even better, have one made for you like I have.|`|rVUCTz3Taa	Wow that hucth looks really good you must spoil your rabbits.. With the wood you will have to be careful for when the rabbits start to bite.. When you buy it just ask if they recommend it <br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|WttNh1hsaa	i have a two story rabbit hutch and its fine. to stop your rabbit from biting the wood use toilet tubes for it to play with and chew on thats what i use it works
JZP4Wmtzaa	It's a dog. It can't talk. Maybe that's why it's quiet?|`|3D4WiM4naa	well maybe she is waiting for u to come home? if u have  routine of going outside of sunday. the dog will be waiting for u
XurYYreBaa	She's probably playing.  Some rats simply see feet & especially toes as something to chase & attack.<br>  If this bothers you, try saying "no" in a kind of high voice (like an annoyed rat) & put her in her cage immediately whenever she does this.  I've never tried this for foot-biting but it works well with play nipping in general.  You could also wear shoes or slippers when your rat comes out to play.|`|8RRZvkqBaa	my rats used to nibble my toes but that is a really good question.  they nibble on anything. that is just what they do. they nibble on stuff to keep their teeth worn down, and toenails are a good target they are on a funny looking (toe) and the nail is hard enough to nibble. i think they like the smell of like foot sweat. my rat always is interested in my sock so i took them off but he was still licking my foot. i think they like the saltiness. one of my rats (the one that licks my feet) also grooms my hands all the time.|`|IC9S3brpaa	For some reason that has yet to be explained Rats tend to have a fascination with toes and feet. <br>  <br>  Maybe try wearing socks or slippers while she is out so she leaves your toes alone. <br>  <br>  It could be something to do with the smell of feet that intrigues them so much but as i said it is unknown the actual cause of the fascination.|`|BWez86Ldaa	Probably just being playful! :) That, or she's trying to trim your toenails for you, which is even better! lol
283f865e237ea72119b132f652eb514baa	a regular ol cat does that. I have one that does that, his name is Shrillbert. I also call him Shrilly and Pretty Shrill. I also have his mom (9 years old) and his 3 brothers (8 years old) and none of them sound like that. He does meow too though.|`|a08xszn3aa	My 5-6 month old kitten does that too.<br>  I just think its cute.<br>  We have heard her actually meow before.<br>  I think its just easier for them to make that shrill squek noise.|`|4t10YACQaa	My cat sort of squeaks!

Take your dog to the vet. If you can find the bottle of the conditioner, read eat and have it ready for the vet to read. There is probably other micro organisms in there too.

Call your Vet explain the situation.  Tell him what was in the water.  And see if your Vet thinks you should bring your dog in.<br>  You could also watch her.  If she doesn't eat, drink, act sick, vomits, has loose stool.  Then immediately take her to the Vet.<br>  But if she acts ok, drinks, eats, doesn't vomit or have a loose stool.  Then she's ok.<br>  I would watch her for at least 2 hours for any sign of illness.  And take her to the Vet immediately if she does show sign of illness.|`|HylgDXk7aa	you really need to call the vet. the ingredient is what you need made known to a vet or call the Poison Control Center.<br>  <a href="http://www.aapcc.org/DNN/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aapcc.org/DNN/</a><br>  You can look up there for whatever state you are in and get a phone number. or just google Poison Control Center and your state. <br>  let them know what happened and have the bottle there and read the ingredients to the person on the phone. they are very nice and very helpful and its free.|`|WniOOchkaa	She should probably be okay if it's been a little while.

2c844fcf526bc2b90f16b7c425e11aa7aa	I would be cleaning it up before he gets it all over himself and then you have the crate AND the dog to clean.|`|z0km5nENaa	i'll lock you up in a crate and see how you feel afterwords|`|ce242ed5158fddbbd7d2bd6a7e4cfd17aa	He's acting out and telling you he doesn't like the crate. Most dogs will not poop where they sleep so he is telling you he doesn't like the crate.<br>  <br>  I would recommend against the crate but others swear by it.<br>  <br>  You need to teach him to get along with the other pets or you will be faced with a choice of keeping him or finding a good home for him.<br>  <br>  By all means though clean the poop and show your dog some compassion...I don't think we would like being in the crate<br>  <br>  I would talk to an animal professional about the best method for teaching him to get along with others but using treats and clickers seem to work very well.|`|IKlHn1EJaa	Well of course you should clean it up.<br>  If you don't, he'll think he's allowed to.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is as SOON as he poops, get him out of the crate and put him outside (or wherever he's supposed to go to the bathroom).<br>  Keep him there for a couple minutes, and eventually he'll get the idea.
u3Hdoeiqaa	I think crates can be good for a dog in terms of their natural behaviour - but only when used properly.<br>  <br>  For example, a crate with a blanket thrown over it and a comfy bed inside can be a "safe" place for a dog to retire to if it gets distressed, eg on fireworks night or if kids are visiting. It should be any area that the dog chooses to go to - not a cage.<br>  <br>  I understand that using a crate can be helpful in training but it is not something I would do personally. It is almost always used for convenience, and some people abuse them - crating their dog for hours at a time.|`|2fGHF3RQaa	Dogs are domestic animals, they don't necessarily need to be part of a pack.  Your the pack leader to them.|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	Good question. I personally do not "crate," but my dog has a cage she goes into when we are bringing in groceries (she gets in our groceries and has eaten our hamburger lol) or something of the sort.<br>  <br>  But I agree, it is unnatural for dogs to sleep alone in a cage. My dog sleeps with me not in some hard plastic cage.<br>  <br>  Crates are for owner's convenience.|`|AA10244990	We only crate ours when we leave the house.  However, when we take him to the boarding when we are out of town, they frequently place another dog in with him.  I think it's kind of comforting for them to have a little friend with them.|`|beO40ap7aa	its for domestication purposes only
ZU7nz2N5aa	My rabbit has had a lot of stomach problems in the past. Take him straight to the vets on Monday morning (Even take him if he looks slightly better, it's better to get him checked out). Stop feeding him rabbit junk food, it could be the cause of the diarrhea. Give him lots of water and make sure he is warm and comfortable. Food wise, I would suggest carrot tops that are thoroughly rinsed, don't give him lettuce, it can cause rabbit's to have upset tummies. Also, if he still has diarrhea then change his bedding often (Every hour, I would recommend) so he isn't sat in his mess and make sure he in a quiet and stress free environmentt as that can be another cause.<br>  I hope this helps.|`|FQmZLqMdaa	Have you fed him lettuce?  It rots in the gut & does not digest it can lead to death.  I would give him some dry toast & lots of water to try & line his tummy.  I would also go to the vets & have him thoroughly inspected, it is obviously not a quick fix.|`|ZdQtNNI9aa	Rabbit junk food as in certain veggies or fruit? Stop giving him the junk and make sure he has enough water, pellets, and timothy hay. Call your vet as soon as they open. This is very serious.|`|WttNh1hsaa	the best thing to do is give him less vegetables and not so much grass u can all so can boil some rice wait for it to cool down so he can eat it that helps also give him lots of water ok that should help good luck|`|oGVWdnHraa	What have you been feeding him?|`|FfBll2n8aa	If you've asked this before, it's obviously something you're doing repeatedly that's causing the problem. It would help to know exactly what you're feeding him - both for meals and for treats. Without that info, I can't help you.
NY4ahjfaaa	well the first answer is mostly right I'd just like to disagree with it not digesting right that's not the case. She needs kitten food because it has more fat and nutrients they need to grow. The adult food doesn't have what they need now. But I have 3 kittens that are 5 months old kitten right now and they will sometimes eat some of their mom adult food and it has never caused any stomach problems. But their diet should def. consist o mostly kitten food. I let all my cats eat at will if the bowl is empty I will fill it up and I have never had an overweight cat. Or maybe mine just know when to stop eating when they are full. lol.|`|vk6sczbLaa	You need to make sure she's only eating kitten food for a while. Kitten food is easier to digest. Her body isn't ready to digest adult cat food yet.<br>  <br>  And it is normal for her to eat quite a bit as a kitten. But watch her carefully so that she doesn't overeat and get too fat. It'd be good to discuss her diet with your vet.|`|u2LGeiA0aa	The adult cat food doesn't have the fat and nutrition your kitten needs, and the reason she eats so much is because you're allowing it. Stop feeding her, she'll turn in to a binge eater. I have a male Ragdoll and a female Korat we've had them both since they were kittens and 6 yrs later they still have the same routine. Routine is important to a cat, as soon as she gets used to the fact that she will be fed the same time everyday she'll be fine, keep the adult cats food separate from her until she learns. Our Ragdoll kept eating the Korat's food, he'd literally push her out of the way, so I moved her to a counter and him over by the water dish, problem solved.
D75rqaihaa	the gravid spot is known to be the babies inside's eye, thats wat makes it dark...yes they do have this all the time, but when pregnant it grows bigger and darker...<br>  the ones with pikish orange in the area, means they are full with eggs, ready to breed...<br>  platies have this too, but nrmally you cant see it, there is a good chance they are all pregnant, or most of them, as they can give birth every 4-5 weeks!!!<br>  <br>  btw there just like platies, there live bearers<br>  <br>  good luck with your new comers, hope i helped!<br>  <br>  happy fish keeping|`|6Xivnmysaa	it is always there it just gets bigger and darker when the fish is pregnant

d87b4fac7f53e9dd399f4663d9097055aa	Has this been addressed by his veterinarian?  That's where it needs to start.  They can run tests to see if everything is normal, as well as prescribe medications to help.  Smaller, multiple meals should be okay, but definitely talk with his doctor.
ur5wDhkMaa	Many moons ago I had a go at breeding Rainbow fish and guppy fry were on the menu, so I set up two 4 gallon tanks for breeding them.<br>  <br>  That didn't work quite as planned. I had no problems with the males at all, but the females just kept dying. Obviously pregnant growing huge then one morning you get up and another dead fish. It actually took quite a few tries to get the first batch of fry.<br>  <br>  Anyway the reason they were dying is they were imported fish and they had been drugged and starved prior to being flown over.<br>  <br>  It appears this wrecks the innards of the females, but doesn't have the same effect on the males, which when you think about it is logical.<br>  <br>  I think you may have bought fish that have recently been delivered. If you only knew the wastage involved in imported guppies; less than 60% make it to the shop and they keep dying after that.<br>  <br>  The recommendation is you don't buy till it's been in the pet shop tank for over a week. If it dies, it's their problem, but this doesn't solve the female problem, they can live for months before it catches them up and it looks like it's your fault. When you get them breeding you will find the fry are more valuable than they should be; the shop that sells mine has them labelled locally bred and I can't breed them as fast as they sell, mine haven't been drugged.<br>  <br>  There's not a lot you can do, if the remaining pair live it's the luck of the draw. You will need another female, so I suggest you source from home bred, most pet shops get them in on a regular basis.<br>  <br>  The male is gasping, that's an oxygen defficiency, but if he's just been imported that wouldn't be unexpected. Not to say he won't recover, males do have a higher survival rate.|`|dbZvPW3Haa	You say you brought them last weekend, did you quarantine them for 14 days, because if there is anything wrong with them they can affect the other fish.<br>  It may be a good idea to get a hospital / quarantine tank and separate the ones that do not look well and treat with esha 2000 this is a good all rounder, and then maybe next time quarantine your fish hope this helps and good luck.|`|D75rqaihaa	im not sure, as my dads gupies do that too, but normally it means the tank is overcrowded, when that happens, the weakest fish will die first...as she was new, she'd have been in slight shock from the move, and maybe she was younger, or pregnant...but by the sounds of it, your male may be next...<br>  <br>  but also as i sed my dads guppies do this and none of his has died...maybe that fish was in shock...sometimes they die from stress if the male annoys them too much trying to breed...some fish cant take it...??<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  and happy fish keeping

8owlj2xHaa	Bamboo sharks are nocturnal.  It will come out in the day,,,,sometimes.<br>  Just give him time to adjust to his new surroundings. I would use the normal florescent light, t-5s would be to bright. Let him see you putting a piece of shrimp or something in the tank, and soon he will start to come out when ever you go near the tank.
FQyeGsIyaa	Most likely, yes.  This behavior is very common to kittens that were weaned too soon.<br>  <br>  I rescued a kitten that turned up under my shed when she was 6 weeks old.  She's now 2 1/2 and still suckles on my t-shirt first thing in the morning, at bedtime and when I come back home after being at work or running errands.  She's very attached to me.  I'll bet your Snowball is very attached to you.  Lucky Snowball for having you find  him!|`|NY4ahjfaaa	Yes he will most likely do that his whole life. I have had many cats that did the same.

58410e61549a3fe40d177cf7e71fc875aa	I've seen horses have a BAD reaction to Listerine, used to control sweet itch symptoms, so be careful about taking advise from strangers on the internet!<br>  There's LOTS of information, about how to deal with sweet itch on this link:<br>  <a href="http://www.sweet-itch.co.uk/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sweet-itch.co.uk/index.html</a><br>  <br>  Sarcoptic mange has NOTHING whatsoever to do with sweet itch! It's an entirely different problem. It's caused by a mite known as Sarcoptes scabiei. This mite lives permanently in the superficial layers of the skin. It causes intense irritation and itching, although some individuals may not show any signs at all. The female mite lays her eggs in tunnels under the skin. They hatch in 3-8 days and then develop into larvae, nymphs and finally adults. The whole of the lifecycle takes 17-21 days and is completed on the host animal.<br>  The disease is highly contagious and the mite is transmitted most frequently by direct contact with infected animals. However the mites are quite hardy and can survive off the host animal - in a home environment at room temperature for 1-6 days.<br>  <br>  Also, motor oil is carcinogenic, and should NEVER be applied to skin. You should not dump used motor oil on the ground, down a drain, into a storm sewer or place it in the trash. Many landfills will not accept used motor oil even if it is in a sealed container because it will eventually leak out into the ground. It's dangerous stuff.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Well you don't do anything with it unless your pony actually has sweet itch, which is an ailment of the dock, not the mane. Amounts, use, dilution and precautions will all be printed on the label of the bottle, otherwise consult your usual vet.|`|an1L8njXaa	Right as others dont seem to know what they are talking about here we go:<br>  <br>  Sweet itch has absolutly nothing to do with mange, lice or other skin condition. it has nothing to do with any form of mite<br>  <br>  Sweet itch is an ALLERGIC reaction to CULICOIDES midge bites! the flying type that get everywhere!<br>  <br>  <br>  It Results in itchy skin Primarily on the MANE and TAIL however in bad cases the reaction can be spread down the neck, belly and even legs. I have seen one horrific case of sweet itch where the horse was so allergic that he tried to rip his own legs with his teeth.<br>  <br>  There are lots of old methods of treatment. I would not reccomend listerene as this will sting badly.<br>  <br>  The best method is prevention. preventing the midges biting.<br>  To do this you need either a rug like the boett or to stable the horse at peak midge times (dawn and dusk). Ensure the horse does not have access to anything to scratch on (lots and lots of electric fencing) and ensure he is not in a field with any form of standing water (midges breed in still water). If possible put him in a field where it is quite windy, midges struggle in the wind.<br>  <br>  The next method is soothing the itch. I have had very good results with benzyl benzoate, micro-tek, Avon skin so soft, and pure aloe vera. In very bad cases steroids from the vet may be required. normaly you put these oily mixtures on the crest, mane, tail, belly and sheath/udders. dont forget the bald bits on the inside of the back legs as well.<br>  <br>  Washing the horse once a week to remove any scurf can also help alot.<br>  <br>  I have a show horse with bad sweet itch and i manage it through the use of the boett blanket, and microtek. He is also stabled during peak midge hours and i have an awful lot of electric fencing set up. his field is on the the side of a very windy welsh hill.<br>  we can manage to get through a summer with a full mane and tail if i am careful<br>  <br>  Dont get to disheartened though there is a vaccine currently being trailed, it should be on the market hopefully in 2010. I had my pony on it and the improvement he had was amazing.<br>  <br>  for more advice you should call the national sweet itch centre on thier hot line phone number is 01352 771718<br>  thier website is<br>  <a href="http://www.sweet-itch.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sweet-itch.co.uk/</a>|`|B6zl0AJDaa	I've seen folks try and use listerine without a lot of success...<br>  <br>  They also call it "sarcoptic mange", "Spanish Itch", "Summer itch", lice etc.<br>  <br>  Well if you're willing to try anything, here's a decades old remedy for it... Motor oil (New or used). Simply paint your horse/pony with it and it will kill the fungus/bugs. Leave it on at least a month and within 2 weeks of painting it on, you'll see new hair growing in hairless spots. What happens is, that it coats their little bug bodies and because bugs breathe through their skin, suffocates them...<br>  <br>  I should state that you SHOULD either WASH your horse/pony with dawn or something else that will take the oil off IF you HAVE to ride before you put any tack on it.  IF you don't you WILL stain your tack and boots (I actually heard somebody did ride with it on their horse and it stained all their tack and their black boots turned brown)...  Thought that would be a no brainer.|`|kLmZAaqHaa	I am sorry I know nothing about Listerine in the treatment of sweet itch but could not resist putting in my penny worth as I have seen excellent results using aloe vera gel and know how irritating sweet itch is both for you and your poor pony. I am sure if you ask your vet he will know about aloe vera. sorry cannot help with listerine.
SZOMVGBRaa	LOL at the pet shop guy, that just means he doesn't know. Ya if I stick a tiger shark and a tuna in the ocean on opposite ends of the earth they should be ok together.<br>  <br>  Well Male rams are usually aggressive towards other male rams only  and leave most other fish alone. The Agassizi on the other hand is a little more aggressive and is know to claim and defend large areas from all other fish and be harmful to the females of his own kind. I wouldn't do it, although a 45 gallon is a big tank its just not big enough if both pairs start to breed.<br>  <br>  Make sure you know your water Quality is under control, don't just think. Both of these pairs no matter which one you choose are very sensitive to water quality. The Agassizi you see in the shop may even be wild caught as well which means they will be even more sensitive. The rams on the other hand will be tank bred 99% of the time so they will be more hardy. Still no need to push your luck, small water changes twice a week are good ideas with both these fish. Both water changes should add up to about 30 -35 % a week.  <br>  <br>  Best of luck|`|ElyP5kLMaa	Thay are both under family of African Cichilds...For Ram (about 5in's max size)and Agassizi Dwarf Cichlids(about 3.5in's max) thay will get alone fine.. with a 45Gals tank...<br>  Twig Catfishes are very lay back and pacefully (by that i means Even u push tham thay still hardly move ). Cichlids can get very aggressive, doing very good damage on this good looking Algae Eaters, even kill it. <br>  On the Lemon Tetra, thay stay small, let's put it this way Cichlids will eat anything can fit into there mouth..so thay will take ur tetra as lunch.<br>  By this 2 reason.... i personaly won't put Twig and Tatra with Cichlids fishes!<br>  Good luck hope this helps!

kfrgLKX1aa	Well, the mothers eat up their babies because they lack protien. After giving birth to about 6-15 baby hamsters, don't you think they'd be tired? (the answer is yes...) The baby is like a part of the mother. So each time a baby is born, a part of the mother is gone ( in terms of energy.). If you don't feed it food with a lot of protien, such as banana ( best) or egg( last resource for me....) they will end up eating up their baby for more protien... I know this is a sad fact, but this is life...sigh...<br>  <br>  They won't eat the babies if you disturb them. They will eat their babies if you touch them..hm... fine, maybe if you disturb them, but most of the time they wont. They usually eat because they lack of protien ( maybe water too,)  or because you touched the babies. They might also eat the babies up because it is too old, or young, to give birth to a healthy litter<br>  <br>  The mother wouldn't want you to contaminate it's new born and all...<br>  <br>  . /\_<br>  (O.o 7<br>  (____)7 hope I helped and gave you a good explanation to you question...|`|75c40712ce4c1c9063d61b17387937f9aa	we didn't have baby hamster, but we did have gerbils...close enough. and i noticed if they kept reproducing they would eat their babies when they thought they started running low on space. kinda gross.|`|AA11098841	Female hamsters generally eat their babies as a result of their feeling they have an inability to feed all of them or from a lack of protein in the mother's diet-a mother hamster needs to have an increased protein intake after giving birth and during lactation.|`|ak9DrBSwaa	Yes, some other possibilities include<br>  <br>  *hamster is too old or too young to deliver a healthy litter<br>  *genetic issues<br>  *mom didn't have the best diet, so wasn't in good enough shape to sustain a litter<br>  *improper cage/space considerations<br>  *poor husbandry|`|oLVJ9EKAaa	Not all hamsters have maternal feelings. They're not humans and so sadly don't have very much common sense. It's just a natural instinct that they get from when they were in the wild.
boOi7xJJaa	These baby hamsters grow extremely fast.  By the time they are 6 weeks old they are often almost as big as their parents.  <br>  New borns are about 2/3 inch long, pink and odd looking but change very fast!|`|ak9DrBSwaa	picture at 3 days old<br>  <a href="http://www.hamsters.co.uk/rearing_russian_babies.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.hamsters.co.uk/rearing_russia...</a>|`|eG4JvTTjaa	3 inches at the most.|`|ZdQtNNI9aa	Really small.

Each dog reacts differently to the procedure.<br>  <br>  If she is injuring him to the point where he needs veterinary care or first aid, then you have a serious problem that requires the help of a certified behaviorist.  Your vet can probably recommend one.  Meanwhile they should be kept strictly apart.<br>  <br>  If she is pouncing on him and making a lot of scary gestures and noises but not putting holes in him or leaving him limping then there is hope a regular obedience class and increased exercise will help as much or more than the spay.  If you still have a problem after those solutions, you can still consult the behaviorist and have a good chance of a positive outcome.
