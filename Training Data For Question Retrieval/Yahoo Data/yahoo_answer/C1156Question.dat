20090308080609AACaWvd	Beauty & Style;Hair	Question for stylist or someone with very thick unmanageable hair?	My hair is extremely thick.  I have literally twice as much hair as most people and it is very wavy.  I normally wear it wavy - just put mousse in it and let it air dry.  If I straighten it, it takes me at least an hour and if it's raining or humid, it gets wavy again the second I leave the house.  In the summer I just put in back in a ponytail.      Right now it's just past my shoulders with long layers.  I want to get it cut shorter.  I feel like I can never do anything with it.  It's just unmanageable!!  I love Jenny McCarthy's hair cut that's shorter in back and long on the sides.  I don't want to go above my jaw.  If my hair is too short it just looks like a mushroom b/c it's so thick and poofy.  I need something that doesn't require a lot of time in the morning as I have a 2 year old.  I want to be able to wear it both straight and wavy.      Does anyone else out there have hair like mine?  What kind of cut do you have?  I'm also thinking of having it thinned out with thinning shears.  Thanks.

20090308050852AAA9H2l	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Do girls ever test guys by dissing them to see how they react? This is what she did on our first date.?	We're both 20. Alright, this girl has a huge crush on me.  So I took her out and we hung out for 3 hours just walking around.      The entire time she was extremely attached to me it wasn't even funny.  We basically acted like we were already boyfriend/girlfriend.  We've only known each other for 2 weeks!      We went to a play.  First thing she does is start talking to this guy next to us.  She talks to him for 10 minutes straight and then quickly turns around to look at me.  I, knowing she was trying to make me jealous, kept my cool and started talking to the guy myself haha.  She just kept looking at me while I talked to him.      At the end of the date, she suddenly had a mini-flip out and starts saying, "YOU are soooo indecisive, you know that?  God, you're soooo indecisive.  When we were in that taxi? Remember that?  You are SOOOOOOO indecisive!!!"      And I kept my cool and said, "well, Amy.  I guess you're just gonna have to get used to it ;)  Can you do that?"      And suddenly she had this surprised look on her face, paused for a split-second, and then she calmed down and she says "Yes I can.  I can do that."      Was that a test?  She's a really sweet girl otherwise and she's smart and really artsy.  Do all girls seriouysly do these things?  Are these to test our manliness or something?

I'm really bored with my hair and I would love to grow it out long but the problem is when i grow it long, it doesnt fall back down, it just goes up like an afro. Is there any special shampoos or conditioners I could use to straighten my hair? I would rather not have to have the hair salon do it with the relaxer because I heard thats very bad for your hair. Is there a natural relaxer that hair salons can use for it thats healthier? I don't want it completely straight, I'd love to have it wavy sort of. Would I have to grow my hair out like an afro first and then straighten it? cause that would be annoying also.   Any tips would be great!! Especially if your a hair stylist lol.  The truth is every time I go to the salon there is no style i can do with this type of hair. It's usually just cut it short and thats it. I feel as though with wavy/straighter hair, you can do a lot more with it.  Thanks!!

It's not rosacea (i don't think) but it looks like a light case.   Anyways, what are some good cleansers, toners, moisturizers and other facial products that are good for my skin?

I'm currently using Garnier Nutritioniste Nutri-Pure purifying gel cleanser and Garnier Skin Naturals Fresh 24-hour Hydrating Day Cream twice a say.

My MAC 187 brush, especially the white bristles, feels oily even after brushing it with baby shampoo. What can I do?       I was using liquid foundation with my brush and I saw that the white bristles was stained yellow. Thus, I poured some baby oil thinking that it can help me remove the yellow stain. It worked!      BUT, after that, the white bristles feels oily even when I washed it with baby shampoo. I washed 3 times already, the first 2 times after it dried, it still feels oily. I'm still waiting for it to dry after the third wash.      Please advice on how I can remove the oil - it doesn't feel oily when it's wet. But when it's dried, the white bristles feels oily and when I brush it on my hand, the area the bristles touched looks shiny.      TIA!

HE was like what color now--all mean about it--don't do anything crazy because that's for teenagers--Oh he's 22. My problem is like should't he love me no matter what my hair color is?I honestly think that he would just be embarrassed to be with me in public.

20090308084117AAMIkgR	Beauty & Style;Hair	Why do salons always say box dyes are terrible?	Personally, I have been using box dyes and going to hairdressers for several years.  I dye my hair every few months.  At first, I used a cheap semi-permanent box dye and was happy with the results - it gave my medium-dark brown hair a reddish tinge, which was the colour the box showed, and what I was aiming for, so it was perfect all around.  My hair didn't shown any signs of damage either. And I had long hair (at least half a foot past my shoulders), so it wasn't just that my hair was too short for damage.  The process was also easy.  Mix the bottles, use the squirt nozzle, be careful where you put it, mess up your hair, get it all through it, wait 20 minutes.  Easy.  With no mess.      Now, every time I went to get my hair cut, the hairdressers would ask me where I got my hair coloured, and I would say that I did it myself with a box dye.  They would kind of be in shock and say something like "You shouldn't do that, it's bad for your hair.  Come to a hair salon to get it coloured, you'll be happier with the results."  So I tried that, several times.      The first time, I said I wanted a red auburn, or copper brown, and the hairdresser had no dye that even RESEMBLED a red, so she mixed brown and blonde which gave a sort of shimmery light brown.  That was pretty, but it wasn't even close to what I asked for or what I wanted.  I didn't really mind it, but a few months later I used a box dye again and was happy with the colour I got.      The next time I went to the salon to get my hair coloured, it was a nightmare.  Again, they didn't have anything CLOSE to the colour I wanted (do salons just HATE gingers or think that nobody would want hair that colour or something?) so she mixed a dark brown with a reddish tint.  At the beginning, I asked her very clearly, is it going to turn out purple-ish? Because I hate the purple-ish colour that all the girls are doing these days.  I really, really, really don't want that colour.  She said it would be fine, would be a lovely darkish red.  I told her I didn't want it dark. She said it wouldn't be too dark.  So I got it done.      When it was all finished, I looked at it in the mirror and was kind of flabbergasted.  It was purple.  The salon lady praised me for the beautiful hair colour, and I told her I didn't like it, it was purple.  Her response: it would fade eventually...      And she made me pay the 80 dollars (!!!!) jesus christ.  All I could think of was, if I had gone with a box dye, I would have gotten the colour I wanted, AND it would have cost me less than 10 dollars, a fraction of the salon's fee.      I went another time at another place and got a colour that was nothing like what I wanted, after clearly stating "copper brown" or "auburn".  Again, they didn't have anything red, gave me a blonde + brown, and it was fine, but not anything like what I wanted.  At least it wasn't a horrible purple.      Anyway, maybe you're thinking my hair is incredibly damaged.  I have used box dyes probably 20 times now and almost always go back over my entire head just to freshen the colour.  For halloween last year, I dyed my hair green (which came out SPECTACULAR, it was a vibrant emerald green that looked fantastic (well, as fantastic as green hair can look)) and the dye that I used was so strong that I had to bleach 3 times (with a box) to get it out.  At that point I was thinking of going to a salon, but remembering my experiences, I figured they'd probably **** it up or say it couldn't be done.      After bleaching 3 times I finally got the green mostly out of my hair, and used a blonde from a box overtop, which looked great.  My hair also felt great, after using a good conditioner.  No problems whatsoever.      Later, I decided to go back to my natural brown.  I used a box dye several shades darker than what I actually wanted, because I knew it would fade quite a bit.  My hair is now back to natural and feels and looks the same as it ever did, after all that.      Now, I am SO confused.  Even on yahoo answers I constantly get people saying that you shouldn't use box dyes, they are bad for your hair, you won't get the right colour, the salon is better and probably cheaper if you screw it up, etc... but it's just NOT TRUE!  All my experience has gotta show that, right?      Can someone give me a good reason that the salon is better? Honestly!  I think they do it just to try to screw people in the wallet!
