N5Vif7Coaa	Uma dica boa : Depois de secar os cabelos d um jato com ar frio do secador. Sempre use o secador de cima para baixo, deixando que o ar acompanhe o caimento do cabelo.

Use sempre o condicionador: ele n?o pode ser deixado de lado, pois finaliza o trabalho do shampoo, fechando as escamas do fio e formando um filme protetor ao seu redor. Sem ele o cabelo fica vulnervel, spero, difcil de pentear, eltrico, sem falar na ausncia de brilho.    2. Creme para pentear: controla os fios rebeldes, podendo ser usado diariamente e reaplicado vrias vezes ao longo do dia. Alm de hidratar, facilita o desembara?o e o penteado, mantendo os cabelos disciplinados. Lembrete: comece a opera??o desembara?o pelas pontas subindo aos poucos at o topo da cabe?a. Se voc tem cabelo longo, escove-o ainda seco, antes do banho. Isso ajuda um bocado na hora de desembara?-lo.    3. Como fazer uma boa escova: antes de qualquer movimento fa?a uma pr-secagem dos fios, deixando-os quase secos. S ent?o parta de fato para a escova. Comece bem rente  raiz e v esticando o cabelo e jogando o vento quente do secador (usando o bucal direcionado) no comprimento. Mantenha a mecha muito bem esticada e ao final d um jato de ar frio nos fios para fechar as escamas e garantir o brilho.    4. Lisos mas com volume na raiz: experimente secar completamente o cabelo de cabe?a para baixo. Assim, voc empurra a raiz dos fios em outra dire??o. Ela se levanta e o cabelo enche.  um truque simples para o dia-a-dia.    5. Escova??o: as escovas de cerdas naturais, de crina ou plos de cavalo, s?o mais indicadas para cabelos lisos ou levemente ondulados. Elas desembara?am e acabam com a eletricidade e n?o quebram os fios. Cerdas naturais de javali tm o plo com escamas, que distribuem a oleosidade natural ao longo do cabelo.    6. Escovas trmicas: s?o as que tm a base de metal furada. Ajudam muito na hora de fazer a escova. Os furinhos permitem a passagem do ar quente e a base de metal aquece e ajudando a secar o cabelo por dentro.      Cuidados:    1. Cuidado com o clima mido: ele arrepia os fios e deixa os cabelos rebeldes. Isso porque a umidade do ar  absorvida pelo cabelo deixando os fios mais pesados e arrepiados, por conseqncia, o cabelo fica liso por menos tempo. O ver?o  a esta??o em que esse fen?meno ocorre com mais freqncia.    2. Para n?o deixar marcado: prender o cabelo molhado n?o quebra os fios, se isso foi feito com cuidado, j que as escamas est?o mais abertas e vulnerveis. Mas voc ter um tremenda surpresa na hora de soltar as madeixas. Elas ficar?o marcadas, dependendo do jeito que voc as enrolou.    3. Bonito sempre: um bom hbito  aparar as pontas religiosamente, a cada um ou dois meses, pois cabelos lisos denunciam facilmente estragos. Esta a??o ajuda a manter o corte bem definido, elimina as pontas duplas e o cabelo fica mais bonito e saudvel.    4. Alimenta??o: a alimenta??o interfere na sade do cabelo. Vitaminas, minerais e protenas n?o podem faltar nas refei??es.  que o organismo se utiliza desses nutrientes para fabricar os fios. Na falta de algum deles o cabelo corre risco, fica quebradi?o, ressecado e sem brilho.   http://www.portalms.com.br/canais/detalh...|`|gCiuWmKYaa	Eu tenho um dica que mtas meninas acham que nao funciona... mas funciona pq eu fa?o s vezes... minha m?e e o pessoal de antigamente fazia mto..la vai  pega uma meia cal?a, corta o peda?o da coxa, d um n em uma das pontas (faz tipo uma toca) da coloca na cabe?a e vai ajeitando o cabelo todo na toca, enrolando na cabe?a e fica com ela por um tempo (parece que quanto mais ficar melhor o resultado).

Perdon pero es el unico tip que me s..  Espero te sirva.|`|BFRPPsLoaa	Para dar la impresin de que tus ojos son ms grandes, no slo tienes que delinearlos, tambin debes tomar en cuenta su color, para ver que tonos te favorecen y en base a eso aplicar las tonalidades adecuadas, primero te voy a dar una una tcnica para hacerlos parecer ms grandes y luego una  guia para que identifiques los colores que te quedan atendiendo a tu color de ojos.     Despus de aplicar la sombra, delinea tus ojos de la siguiente forma:    Cn un lpiz delineador en color obscuro (*****, del mismo color de la sombra ms obscura que utilces o caf, si los colores de sombras lo admiten), delinea tus ojos slo por fuera, en ambos prpados, traza una lnea delgada en cada uno y luego sobre ese trazo la vas engrosando a tu gusto.    No delinees tus ojos por dentro, eso los hace parecer ms peque?os.    ?De qu color son tus ojos? Es larga la informacin pero vale la pena que la leas:    SI TUS OJOS SON VERDES, los tonos que ms van a resaltar tu iris son los marrones, morados y violetas.    Dependiendo de la intensidad de tu iris, puedes utilizar tonos ms oscuros si tus ojos son verde claro, o tonos ms claros si tus ojos son verde oscuro.    Tambin puedes utilizar una sombra verde, por supuesto, pero el efecto no es el mismo, ya que al utilizar un color diferente al del iris la atencin se fija en el color del ojo.    SI TUS OJOS SON MARRONES, ?ests de suerte! porque todos los tonos favorecen a los ojos marrones.     De todas formas los que ms favorecen son los verdes, marrones (toda la gama, desde bronce hasta dorado) y los grises y plateados.    SI TUS OJOS SON AZULES, los tonos que ms van a resaltar tu iris son los rosas (perfectos para utilizar por el da para un maquillaje natural, especialmente el rosa palo nacarado), rojos (por qu no, para un maquillaje de fiesta), morados, naranjas, melocotn, dorados y bronces en todos los tonos.    Al igual que para los ojos verdes, puedes maquillarte tambin con tonos azules, pero si quieres resaltar tu iris utiliza un azul totalmente diferente al de tu color de ojos; por ejemplo, si tus ojos son claros utiliza un azul oscuro casi a?il y si tus ojos son azul oscuro utiliza un tono color cielo.    SI TUS OJOS SON MARRONES VERDOSOS, los tonos que ms van a resaltar la parte verde de tu iris son los morados, rosas y violetas. Si quieres resaltar el color marrn de tu ojo, utiliza los colores aconsejados anteriormente para ojos marrones.    SI TUS OJOS SON OBSCUROS, los tonos que ms van a resaltar tu iris son los tonos claros. Usa los colores que te favorecen segn tu color de ojos, pero utilizando dichos colores en tonos claros o nacarados. Por ejemplo, si tienes los ojos verde oscuro, puedes utilizar un tono malva claro.    SI TUS OJOS SON CLAROS, los tonos que ms van a resaltar tu iris son los tonos obscuros. Utiliza los colores que ms te favorecen segn tu color de ojos, pero elige los tonos ms oscuros de estos colores. Por ejemplo, si tienes los ojos azul claro, puedes utilizar un tono marrn oscuro nacarado o un dorado bronce.    ?Ahora lo que te interesa!:    SI TUS OJOS SON PEQUE?OS, lo ideal es que si quieres resaltar tu iris sigas las pautas antes descritas segn tu color de ojos, pero no olvides elegir los colores en tonos claros y nacarados. Por ejemplo, si tienes los ojos marrones puedes utilizar un tono dorado nacarado, resaltar el color de tu ojo y adems lo har ms grande.    SECRETOS PROFESIONALES    Recuerda que cuando quieres resaltar la forma de algo (el ojo, los labios, el pmulo) puedes utilizar tonos claros y nacarados. Si quieres perfilar forma y dar profundidad, debes utilizar tonos oscuros y mates, por ejemplo, si tienes los ojos hundidos elije tonos claros y nacarados ?te favorecern mucho!|`|a6ffea25c0aa401a19f230798b7a8fdaaa	Con un delineador.

Sorry kid, them's the breaks :).     With regard to the boy, honey you're just going to have to muster up a little bit of grown-up attitude here. Trust me when I say this, 5 years from now you'll feel ridiculous for caring so much what some unimportant pubescent boy thinks about your hair. He's wrong to be so deliberately hurtful toward you, that is absolutely true. However, it's important that you learn to deal with people like him; I can tell you, they'll always be there in some form or another. You can't let yourself get so distressed, because ultimately; you don't live your life for the boys at school (or you shouldn't) you live it for yourself. |`|I2XY3aXdaa	wow.   it's one of the,um.sorry!, weirdest cuts i saw.    but one girl in my school had the ALMOST SAME haircut as you...    but no one teases her because she has confidence that watever her hair looks like, she's pretty.    she dons these wide and very girly and pretty hair bands, and sometimes she recreates long turbans into simple but cool styles.    that's why the one given attention to is the hairstyle, not the haircut.    anyway, i suggest when you place hairband, dont pull your hair back as if it looks neat. make it look laid back with "i-just-rolled-out-of-bed-looking-this-c... look. let little strips of hair slip down your face and don some makeup (light and natural only please!)    then pair it up with a cool earrings and there you go!    Oh! i forgot! you could also cover it up with bandanas. make it quirky and totally you by sewing on cute pins, brooches, buttons, beads, but do not over do it or else people would think you are really ashamed of your hair!!! and there are even crocheted headbands on some ethnic cool stores!!! take your pic and don't ever think your hair's a mullet! anyway, tell that guy he's such a loser to tease girls and call him GAY. haha. kidding.   ignore the jerk and make a whole new fad in school!    goodluck and i hope i helped you!    |`|iVDFdCeQaa	so....lol i found you because i myself just got the same haircut and i'm sorry it totally sucks and ya its been called a mullet several times now- all i've been able to do is pin back the top with bobby pins... bought a cute white and pink hat and white ear rings and i've worn a head band a little bit as for your cut i saw a great possibility for like an A-line haircut at or below the chinish but go to an expert stylist! pay $35-40! why not look at some highlights and just go for a new look! as soon as we get rid of that extra long hair no one can call it a mullet anymore!! i'm so close to getting that chin cut i've just spent the last 1/2 hr looking at extensions on the internet the good thing is that in 5 years we'll look back and laugh  www.myspace.com/anna_bucks |`|rRwUv2hxaa	Awww honey =(    Everyone at some point in their life gets a bad haircut. It WILL grow out.    As for tweedletwat (nasty boy lol) IGNORE HIM. Just look at him and his hair, and say "Pot. Kettle. Black." LOL. And 'mullet man'? How original. Not.   God. I hate mean people.  Unless you want to wait for a few months for it to grow out, I think there are two options.  You could get extensions put in to thicken out the bottom bit, making it less mullety. This might damage your hair though, and will probably cost lots of money. Alternatively, you could cut it short, into a pixie crop style, like this:   http://www.celebrity-hair-styles-magazin...    and    http://www.celebrity-hair-styles-magazin...    I think it's a really pretty and stylish, and not many people have the guts to go for such a style. And i think it would really suit you as you look like you have a very delicately shaped face. But this time be REALLY careful, and pay a bit extra for a more experienced hairdresser. Take in a picture of what you want done. The website has a list of all the info for the hairstyle under the picture, so you should give that info to the hairdresser too.  Btw, don't worry about your hair curling a little with this hairstyle. It will make it look really pretty and feminine. but warn the hairdresser that this is what it will do so she can cut it right =)  Good luck!

I am *SO* sorry for you.    Thats horrible, I cant believe she cut layers that high.    *shudder*    It looks kinda vince noir's hair from the mighty boosh.. but he looks hot and it sort of looks like you have no hair and just got some extensions in the back a bit?    I would make the length a bit shorter.. I mean it'll look a bit better and it'll grow back to that length as the layers grow out.

I also find that not washing in soap or any kind of face wash helps. I use a baby wipe on my face and neck everyday and I hardly get spots. I use a gentle seaweed scrub once a week. I too have sensitive skin (not as bad as my bf) and I find it's great! try it...... you can always try something else if it's not for you.    Seaweed scrub should be available in Ur local body shop or if you don't have a local one then go to www.bodyshop.co.uk    good luck|`|xHdZexshaa	OIL of OLAY     All the Lady's in my family use it its good to reduce wrinkles smooths and moisturizes the skin not thick not smelly feels clean on the skin!|`|fd2c6af3da3b9fcdff51c768c174ba1daa	Use Lush products, lush.com, everything is natural, not tested on animals and the staff are really helpful and totally honest!

spibF7Dyaa	Good question. Unfortunately there aren't any online sites that I know of that send out free cosmetic freebies, but one thing you should try and signing up at the manufacturers of the cosmetic/beauty brands that you like and they will sometimes email you special offers. If you visit the cosmetic counters at the larger department stores, you can often get samples. You may want to call your local Nordstroms and ask them about their next cosmetics trend show - they give you a ton of free beauty stuff at the show. I just attended one recently and got a beauty tote and a bunch of high end beauty goodies. Good luck!
6154d9f9b19656e2d90832cfa63e81f7aa	Tried it, and loved it. I am normally a waxer too but a friend told me about threading and i had to check it out... its great and not  too painful.  You have gotta try it out! :)|`|43b51cbdde14a9a815a142de6996e4eeaa	I thread my eyebrows every month. Its very clean and it gives ur brows a natural shape. It is originated in India. Over here in my country (Singapore), threading usually costs $5. and it can sometimes be even $4 (if u bargain). They also do provide services such as threading your face (cheeks, lips, etc) and usually after threading, your face will be smoother.|`|764f825583da471c5dc9bd4ca5af4afaaa	threading is good it last long ,its done ,like use thread,and tweezers after.|`|81c0c648c1caa1976d61cab92a815983aa	Tips on Hairremoval/   Makeup /cosmetic tricks /celebrities makeup/  hair highlighting /etc...     http://geebal.blogspot.com|`|cbcde3b411cf935a33beb2dd1f2f92b7aa	It's a dollar or 2 more expensive then the waxing.

isYvEiUGaa	dont bother with liquid  use a pencil pull your eyelid towards your temple and apply|`|19TSkwaKaa	Use a decently priced liquid eyeliner.  Start from the middle go to the outside of your eye, then do the inside to the middle.  If you think its too thick or its not looking as good as pencil, smudge it with your finger, or used eyeshadow to decrease the intensity of it  Hope that helps (:  |`|AA11746917	Go to Lancome and get an eyebrow pencil. Close your eye and just draw a line along your eyelid. I also recommend that you apply it half way across your lower rim. Start in the corner, and go about half way into your eye, toward your nose. Stop half way. If you go  all of the way in, your eyeliner may tend to bleed.    Tip: On the lower rim, do NOT line on the inside close to your eyeball. Line on the lower lid where there is no chance that the eyeliner will touch your eye. I've been doing this for years and it just makes your eyes pop!|`|8c4GTdGIaa	use liquid eyeliner, it won't come off until you take it off with make up remover(or water with lots of scrubbing) make sure you line close to your lash line|`|WQw1DuUsaa	Either liquid or pencil liner will work, but try to use something that says waterproof or smudge proof.     after you apply it, gently pat over it with black shadow- it'll help ''set'' the liner and keep it there longer.     or, if you have a waterproof mascara that doesn't smear- run an angled brush over the mascara brush and use that to line your eyes. (tried and true!)    =) hope this helped!|`|ew8wxzYQaa	its sounds like its the eyeliners fault. i had to try several different kinda too before i found one that worked for me. just try a different brand. powdering it after you apply it helps A LOT too.

Please consider that tattoos are permanent and you will have to live with it for the rest of your life. Not all tattoos turn out how you expect and there is always a risk of infection.

SDVmaOExaa	Looks pretty nice but I don't know about black.|`|3IfBUUH0aa	Stylish and well made, but if I was buying for a 15 y/o  I would probably go down the route of a branded watch like Emporio Armani/D&G or DKNY which are all well made and retail around the same price.

You need to smack whoever told you to put birth control pills on your head.     2. You should first find out why there is hairloss. Could be due to an illness or various products that you are currently using on your head.    3. You can purchase several different products in stores that will aid in hair growth. Maine and Tail Shampoo and Conitioner are one of those products.|`|4b649a55e3811789d0d1e58c31e7e795aa	There is no such product that will help your hair from losing but  you can help it by massaging your scalp.

Certainly layer up and layer so that you can open up some layer(s) to ventilate (perspiration).  You don't want to get wet/damp; damp clothing  wicks away body heat.  DEFINITELY WEAR SOME HEADGEAR.  (The rationale here is that the head radiates a tremendous of  body heat to its surrounds, because as a vital organ its blood supply won't be curbed.)  The headgear comes off easily too, to let you cool down to avoid sweating.  Goose down garments are superior by virtue of weight and insulating qualities, but they areN'T very functional when wet; and they usually are difficult to clean.|`|8a406de12bcb3f873a4a578fdb7e86b5aa	Layers of clothes!

A  nice cushy stuffed jacket that's wind proof, some snow boarding pants.    then, you can use my old family "mexican snow boot" technique to keep the snow out of your shoes:  Use a plastic bag that you would get at a grocery store in produce, wear a sock, then the plastic, then another sock, this keeps your feet dry in the snow!    If there's no snow, then make sure you just double up your socks!    stay toasty, hommie!|`|4cb8b5760be41b5b2d39725072c7e27faa	Are you going to be spending a lot of time outdoors?  This answer is assuming you are.  As opposed to one heavy and thick layer, wear multiple thin outer layers.  Wear something like fleece as the layer closest to your body and the outer layer should be a thin windbreaker.  Depending on your tolerance to cold, you may need other layers, too.  Wear long underwear (top and bottom) under your clothes and outerwear.   And obviously, always wear a hat and gloves to protect you from frostbite.  The temperature is less of the problem and more so the wind.  5-20 is not really that cold, but the windchill could be much lower and brutal.  That's how it is where I live.  Windchills commonly go below -20.

People say match your clothes to your personality. But,that is easier said then done.I love tanks or tee's and tight jeans. I could not pull that look off,unless I wanted to look like a can of biscuits that exploded! I say Go with your body shape. It's takes alot of time.I  get so frustrated most the the time I leave the mall crying.I'm bigger around the waist then in the hips,thighs and butt.So my pants size(that fits my waist) is WAY to baggy in the butt and thigh area. So I buy Maternity jeans,from OLD NAVY.they have button fronts and hidden elastic in the sides. So there is give and they fit tighter around the legs! Now with shirts I look and look and look. For a dresser look gaucho's work great to hide those iffy spots.A really nice color maybe a little sparkle,wrap top.You know one that ties on the side.P.S a girdle never hurt.Be careful not to get one too tight,it will make you buldge in un-natural places.. Or, a nice pant suit .The shirt under neath could be sparkle or lacy. Also a trick I use is accessory's.A nice necklace brings the eye up.and really flashy shoes bring the eyes down.Avoid flashy things or belts around the waist. Good luck and just have fun with your outfit. And remember wear what makes you feel good.Even if you look a hot mess,but you think you look good your head will be high,which make people look at you differently.

f11a95d823e714cf8456b7415eec4dfdaa	The first step you need to take is to look around for a beauty school also known as cosmetology school... some places in bigger cities will offer a special make-up course others it will be combined in with the cosmetology.    Here's a website that will show you some schools in your area.    http://www.beautyschoolsdirectory.com/    Goodluck and enjoy... its a blast!|`|c292d13bd6bc19f2d76daaaa8611f4f7aa	you should start working at a make up store or a hair dressers salon.

A lot of the time, they do make up and hair for pagents and different shows or plays in local theaters. You never really know who you'll met at some of these places.

But if you start going around trying to get with girls, then you will feel sorry afterwards especially when you realized you wasted all your time on a girl you were gonna break up with anyway. Also think about it this way, would you want your future wife to be goin around impressing all the guys and trying to get with them and trying to have sex with them? I would think not.

spibF7Dyaa	Great question! Bobbi Brown makes the best eyeliner and it is ranked best by many fashion magazines. It's easy to apply and easy to blend. You can probably get a sample at the makeup counter or if you buy it and it's not what you expected, you can always return it. It's great though. I go through a full day of work, head straight to the gym and then home and it stays put and doesn't bleed or get smudged. It's great even when you sweat or put in eyedrops.    This is what the company's website says:  AWARD WINNER! Voted 'Best Long-Wearing Shadow or Liner' by "In Style" Magazine (April 2006). This innovative eyeliner offers the precision of liquid liner and the ease of a gel-based formula. Color is long-wearing and water-resistant. Can be used to create subtle to dramatic looks.    Good luck!|`|4c2884d9d6f4bf6a391e732ddcc036caaa	You can use a waterproof Jordana or Revlon eyeliner|`|AA12383147	This is the eyeliner I use. I love it.

The longer handle gives you the ultimate in control because it handles like a Biro. Excellent colours.    Bloom Liquid Liner: a more traditional longer stem with a shorter handle. Good brush.    Rimmel Liquid Liner: like an inkwell, so once more you have a longer handle for control and a shorter brush stem.    Clinique Liquid Line: limited colours, but with a good consistency for application.    ...hope me helped..

The exclusive is in a blue box, now you'll need both the soap and the gel(cream).  You can get each from $10.99 to 13.99 depending on the store. The area you apply it to might start to peel a little but that's OK, it's the dark area been cleared out. They smell very nice also so you won't have to worry about some smelly, nasty product.

D9VqDQBVaa	Shaving is better than putting chemicals on your skin, that you leave for minutes at a time.  Think is the chemicals can disolve your hair in minutes, what will they do to the skin.

Everytime I do, I break out worse than if I shaved with dry legs and a dull razor!  (LOL)  Never hurts to try though.  With your hair being so thin, it won't have to stay on your legs as long.!  GOOD LUCK!|`|c49bc4899a009bc44e3110a74a3ec69aaa	I bought it for the first time last week and tried it twice. I used the 3 min. creme formula for dry skin.     I hate shaving every day, so this product will be a regular usage item for me as long as I don't get any irritation. It does have some odor but it goes away when you wash off the product.     I used it on my arms first. Worked great. Used it on my legs tonight, perfect results.  I don't have the receipt, so I'm guessing at the price around $5 or $6.  Do a patch test on a little part of your arm or leg for 3 min. wash off then wait 24 hrs. to make sure you don't have a reaction. Then you can do your legs or whatever. It works very quickly, so 3 or 4 min. should do the job for you. I used the plastic "razor" and also a wet washcloth, rinsed thoroughly and used some mild soap too. Don't leave any of it on your skin. Also, don't get it near your eyes and wash your hands very well when you are finished. I think it should keep your legs smooth for anywhere from 4 to 7 days.|`|xZ6EyK4caa	I have seen it used and it does keep you from shaving a few days longer than normal shaving it generally lasts about two weeks.|`|mHSSyhFsaa	i just sstarted using it b/c i get razor burn- the veet works great! so smooth! and no red bumps!|`|Hr7ysvkWaa	I've tried it and it works great! It will probably be very beneficial to you since your hair is so thin anyway. It very easy to use, has a great smell and lasts a long time. Try it.|`|8LwkiyVQaa	I bought it and tried when it first can out. Its a waste of money it didn't work!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|lVcGjCnWaa	I use this in the summer when i want perfectly hairless legs! it's great, really easy to use & quick too, and the results are long-lasting - i don't think it's bad for your skin, and shaving must be bad for it anyway because you're pulling the razor across your skin.    in the uk it costs about 7 per pack so $14 or $15 (having said that everything's cheaper over in the US so maybe $10 or $12? maybe you could check their website or a chemist/beauty shop (drugstore? sorry i don't know american terms!)'s website to find out prices?

ABQrquaaaa	Hola!  Estos consejos te van a ser muy utiles:  Primero consegui un lapiz ***** de buena calidad (no compres Avon, etc.). Los mejores son los mas grasos, ya que pintan bien ***** y duran mas. Te das cuenta porque al probarlo no son duros, tienen punta mas blanda y el color es pleno, no queda gris. Uno muy bueno es Lancome, uno mas economico y bueno es el kajal de Natura.  Luego de delinear los ojos (siempre sacale bien la punta), toma un pincel chiquito con punta chata y bien finita, y con una sombra negra pintas sobre el lapiz *****. Esto logra que se fije muy bien el lapiz, evita que se corra y el color queda mucho mas intenso. Tambien te sirve para esfumar y que no quede la linea tan dura.   Si queres mas intensidad con un delineador liquido ***** pintas sobre el lapiz y la sombra una linea muy fina cerca de las pesta?as, no se va a notar que estas delineada con liquido ya que abajo esta el lapiz, pero hace mucho mas duradero todo!  Si mientras te maquillas notas que cae producto (sombra negra) sobre la cara, podes colocar antes de pintarte un "colchon" de polvo volatil del color de tu cara o mas claro en la zona debajo del ojo, alli va a caer todo el polvo ***** y despues retiras el polvo volatil con una brocha. Practicalo que lo use en varios desfiles y no falla!  Espero haberte ayudado!!!  SUERTE!|`|U5QmAwbkaa	lilita:  sea de buena marca o no siempre se corre y terminamos igual!!, me encanta el ***** en mis ojos, y en los de cualquier chava lucen muy bonitos, a veces uso otros colores pero el ***** es el  1!!!!|`|HfjJtBPbaa	Te recomiendo que vayas cambiando de marca hasta que consigas el que te resulte mejor, ojo, no siempre lo ms costoso es lo mejor, a mi el de avon me va muy bien, en cambio el de ebel que es ms caro, se me corre.|`|g2AS4Zsxaa	delineador liquido o retractil son muy buenos.pero tambien fijate la calidad|`|FvI7V5viaa	MIRA YO ESTABA IGUAL KE TU,PASABA CADA CORAJE CON EL LAPIZ.PERO ME RECOMENDARON UNO DE LA MARCA""ALMAY""EA POCO CARO COMO 7.00 Y 9.00 DOLLARES PRUEBALO TE VA A ENCANTAR LOS RESULTADOS.ESO SI VAZ A BATALLAR PARA KITARTELO UN POKITO PERO AL FIN,NO?UNO KE TE DURO TOODO EL DIA.|`|5j76Lirkaa	sabes esto depende mucho de la marca que uses, ponte en contacto conmigo y te muestro unos|`|80Fy3czSaa	de hecho es lo mismo que yo me he estado preguntando pero pues tampoco se y ademas para mi no hay manera de evirarlo|`|K7UiiIY0aa	Negra comprate uno de buena marca...

Reminds me a bit of when I wear that Wind Pro black polar fleece (thats made to block out 95% of the wind, hence the cost and where I bought it from an outdoors/camping store) with chinos, jeans or trousers/pants and long sleeve t shirt like shirt and t shirt underneath it.    Your lucky that with women's and girl's clothes, they are made and are available in a wider range and variety of colours, if not styles too, than men's and boys clothes are in clothes shops and department stores.

Se si indossano delle scarpe da jogging su dei jeans, o dei pantaloni sportivi vanno senz'altro bene, purch la scarpa sia nei toni classici (predominante bianco, blu, grigio chiaro). Ad esempio, con dei jeans scoloriti ed un paio di scarpe di tela bianche, come le classiche 'Superga', il calzino bianco corto ci sta bene...     Per altri colori, come il nero, o i toni naturali,  meglio   abbandonare il bianco...     Con l'abbigliamento formale  obbligatorio preferire il calzino lungo, e comunque mai bianco...      Nella bella stagione e con l'abbigliamento sportivo si pu addirittura omettere il calzino, purch le caviglie e i polpacci eventualmente in vista mostrino il segno dell'abbronzatura.  Con i mocassini leggeri estivi si pu fare proprio cos, anche con la giacca che accompagna una polo o una camicia. Quest'ultima deve essere portata senza cravatta, altrimenti occorrono nuovamente le calze...).    L'abito non fa il monaco, ma una certa cura dell'abbigliamento, che non sia leziosa per,  un buon biglietto da visita...

Se vc usa titura nas suas madeixas vc pode estar usando alguma qumica a base de hidrxido de am?nio,se vc nunca tingiu vc pode usar guanidina ou sdio. Mais qualquer uma dessas qumicas que vc escolha usar  necessrio que vc escolha o tipo pra cabelos finos, que tem nos 3 tipos e  indicado para cabelos mais finos e frgeis.  A vantagem do am?nio  que vc pode estar tingindo depois, s n?o pode descolorir.  A guanidina dizem que alisa mais , mais vc n?o vai poder estar tingindo nem descolorindo depois, s vai poder usar shampoo tonalizantes, que tonalizam da mesma forma das tinturas s que s?o mais suaves e desbotam mais rpido.  O sdio tambm  bom e  o mesmo preocesso da guanidina, tambm n?o pode tingir nem descolorir , s  indicado shampoo tonalizante, s que se tem que ter mais cuidado em se trabalhar com ele pelo fato dele ser mais forte, se ele cair no couro cabeludo pode seer que cause uma doen?a conhecida pelo nome de "pelada", essa doen?a faiz cair o cabelo na area onde o sdio encostou e n?o nasce cabelo nessa area nunca mais, isso ocorre devido o sdio ser muito forte ele destri o bulbo capilar nesta area e nunca mais nasce nada. Por isso a necessidade de um maior cuidado  e neste caso  melhor passar no sal?o.    Em qualquer qumica que vc usar destas 3 vc deve escolher um tipo para cabelos finos, j que o seu fio  t?o fino assim, e quando aplicar de cinco em cinco minutos ficar observando o fio pra ver se ja aliou ou se esta ficando quebradi?o ou mudando muito a cor.    Ah, e o mais importante N?O SE ESQUE?A  de fazer o TESTE DE MECHA, ele super importante pra evitar a quebra dos seus fios. Pegue uma mecha do alto da cabe?a e aplique o produto deixe o tempo necessrio que vem marcando na folheto e se durante esse tempo ele ficar quebradi?o,,poroso ou mudar muito a cor N?O aplique no resto do cabelo!  capriche nas hidrata??es e volte a fazer um novo teste no ms seguinte.Se estiver tudo ok pode aplicar desde que fique avaliando o fio.   Espero ter ajudado  BOA SORTE

c1959faa19be9096a61470c6cfb5b72daa	Tinta lquida para aergrafo: esta provavelmente  a melhor, pela seguran?a, flexibilidade e rapidez. Apesar de ser mais cara que as tintas lquidas de uso geral (da Ben Nye e Mehron), ela  mais resistente. As marcas mais utilizadas no exterior s?o a Kryolan e Dinair. Esta ltima,  muito popular, pois  especializada em maquiagem por aergrafo, tanto a tradicional (de beleza) como de efeitos especiais.     Alguns artistas costumam adaptar tintas j disponveis para serem usadas em aergrafo. Muitos misturam tinta  base de gua de maquiagem (100 mL) com lcool isoproplico (1 xcara) e spray fixador (1/8 de xcara).           Quando se utiliza maquiagens corporais (inclusive as pintadas com aergrafo),  bom ter alguns cuidados:     1) Teste o produto no modelo para saber se ele tem alergia pela tinta. Aplique sobre uma pequena rea do copor (perto do punho ou sobre a parte interna do antebra?o), espere vrios minutos para ver se tem rea??o. Cada pessoa tem uma sensibilidade diferente. As pessoas n?o respiram pela pele. Cobrir todo o corpo n?o os sufoca. O que pode fazer realmente mal  se a tinta provocar rea??o alrgica.     2) Procure usar ventilador para dispersar as partculas de tinta que ficam no ar. Mantenha a press?o do ar no compressor sempre baixa (5 psi) e mantenha o equipamento sempre limpo.     um exemplo de p metlico  o  da marca Ben Nye.|`|BBP4PclCaa	Melhor vc tentar procurar em sites de compras, em lojas vai ser dificil.

T7HLKcFLaa	My hair does that if I don't look after it properly; I spent all my teenage years fighting it, and then I found out what helps, and hopefully these will help you as well :)    Firstly, if you have layers put into your hair, it gives each section its own space to grow, and it tends not to create friction with the rest of your hair that works up frizz. If you have layers already, or don't want them, make sure you always use conditioner. It doesn't really matter which, but when you finish rinsing it out, give your hair a quick cold rinse, as this closes up hair cuticles, making it smoother.    Also, hair becomes frizzy when there is no moisture in it. If you blow-dry your hair, try doing it on a cool setting. It takes longer but this can really help your frizz situation :P If you use straighteners or curling irons, use some sort of heat protection spray that isn't sticky, and make sure your hair is not still damp when you do it, as this causes your hair to 'frazzle' (all the moisture burns off/evaporates)    Keep you hair clean and don't use too many products because build-up makes frizz STAY frizzy. Clean, cool, light hair tends to stay put much better. And I know this seems counter-intuitive, but smoothing some water through your hair can help flatten it out (if you wear your hair straight).    That's the best I can do, hope it helps :)|`|xgWf3SKxaa	yeah its gonna rain tommorow :)    wear a hat|`|LOgGGuRqaa	u could try spraying some hair spray onto your hands then smoothing it onto ur hair...that should help|`|OB2JbmFcaa	That is because your hair is naturally like that.|`|yqqVPcU0aa	In wet conditions, your hair reverts back to its natural state.  Yes its messy, and sometimes embarrasing, but if you learn to work with it, and not against it, it will work in your favour.  Or you can try chemical straightners, they will initially work, but fade quickly with each soaking.|`|8vzUHPJdaa	pantene pro-v anti frizz serum! (link below)  it works for me and it's cheap so it won't hurt to try.  you could also try putting your hood on when it rains and tuck all your hair into it.       http://www.walgreens.com/store/product.j...|`|nyP3Yk8haa	SAME HERE! nothng works unfortunatley|`|d5dKlgEPaa	I have the same problem, and the only product i've found that works is......a hooded sweatshirt. keep your hair out of the rain because unfortunatley there is nothing you can do to stop it.|`|GqlLcRWtaa	you know those cute umbrella hats well try those if it has an opening at the top try a hat under it|`|1MkcGgKjaa	oh my gosh, i have the exact same hair, and exact same problem, me bangs form a wavy flick, and it looks horrible lol, i hate it. but have not yet found a way of stopping it. i guess if we got our hair chemically straightened it wouldnt happen, but thats too extreme lol|`|qgRibLytaa	leave salon/frizz products in ur hair  and leave it up for like 2 hr. when it calls for rain or fog and bring a mini hair comb and bottle of hair cream in ur purse|`|IcCsNNV6aa	hmm all i can say is always use de-frizzing shampoo and i know stuff that works wonders for my friend who has the same problem but its kinda expensive. sorry i dont remember the name, but its in a small clear bottle with a black spray nozzle. sorry i cant be of more help. good luck with your hair|`|DLuDg2vyaa	use an umbrella,   dont get your hair wet..|`|NIYYN6tpaa	If you let your hair grow long................The weight of your hair will prevent that from happening....I know.

I'm sorry, but if your hair is naturally wavy and curly, then you're inevitably going to have problems with wetness. Just use mousse or a curling styling product on that day and bobby pin your bangs at an angle! It'll look really cute!|`|29x9PyM6aa	carry an umbrella duuuuh oh and get some pickles... i heard they're rain repellent.|`|0Y2u1bwiaa	Try using Herbal Essences Dangerously Straight Shampoo and Conditioner.

Its in a purple like i mean dull purple bottle and it looks cheap but it really works!|`|QfkeanBQaa	my mom has her own salon.  and she gives me a lot of hair product   you should use chi products they work very well.  i sometimes put oil on my hair.  or you can just go to a salon and ask them what kind of products you can use.|`|Q2NXrfUjaa	okay you should go to a hair salon and ask them if they have any products for your hair|`|1b94648aabc93d759bbd8eb25154cc95aa	Sweetie, I have the same problem. But don't worry I have a few solutions for our problems.    1. Avoid to putting straighting and curling your hair to often it can lave your hair strands frizzier than they were to began with.   2 Find a style that compliments you and your natural, it will take some time to find the right one but you will find it.   3 Try to avoid going outside the condensation can make your hair very frizzy.  Finally love your natural beatuy|`|zZrKhn9eaa	I always had that problem, but then I started using Garnier Fructis Leave-In Conditioner Cream. It's awesome! And it makes your hair soft and shiny. Bandanas work well in a pinch, when you don't have time for anything else.
ofJ8IBjfaa	My tummy is my biggest problem area too, and Spanx are now my best friend!  They really do smooth everything out.  I wouldn't consider for a minute wearing a dress without my Spanx.    I don't think the the strapless cami gives enough support to wear without a bra.  You might want to try one on for yourself before buying one.    I think a much better bet is the higher power power panties.  They are super comfortable and do a great job holding the tummy in.  The only downside is that you'll be washing them a lot so you can wear them more and more often. LOL|`|QxTIkv3Jaa	yes they are wonderful and really do shape u! i have a pair of the higher power panties and they work so great.  i think u should just try them and see what u like!|`|pl96lkzIaa	I've never tried the cami or bodysuit, but I have the high-waisted power panties, and let me tell you they are seriously awesome.  Definitely worth the money.  They completely flatten out my tummy and the fat roll above my waist (and I'm not some skinny little girl).  I can go down a whole dress size with them on.  I would guess that the other products work just as well.  Hope that helps!|`|QiSDnedFaa	i have a pair of spanx that come right up to my bustline. they work great for smoothing out problem areas. mine don't have a bra part built in, so i don't know about the support question. but other than that, they are a really great investment.

baCQZM0iaa	filene's basement.  designer names, cheap, gorgeous, what more can you ask for!?  they're located almost everywhere. plus now they probably get new things in.     just a tip from a filenes-aholic: go with time! its not always organized and you will have to look through the entire section!     also, if you find a dress that you really really like and you cant find your size, but you can find one that's a little too big (which is normally the case for S-M people), see if you can get it altered. that way it will look even better!|`|sg0m6LBRaa	jessica mclinktock has a whole vintage line!|`|Wu5q79tgaa	isnt graduation like 5 months away????

But dresses i think you should look it up online. Like Prom dresses. Look for one that sells them in your area. Go there and Try on the smallest one. Its works done it once. I finally found one that fit a size 3. I wear a 00 in pants and an x-small in shirts :)|`|ImHWOcJuaa	I'm thinking you should get something loose white, and breezy, not to fancy.

jpAzVmG0aa	I think people think 'pale is pretty' these days. It's kind of sickening really, when a certain skin tone and features get pushed up in status and others get brought down. I think it might have to do with how tan was considered the best look and now pale is in, taking its revenge? I also think it has to do with Twilight and other vampire stuff. Pale is cool now thanks to that crap.|`|ftWsPGNfaa	its a striking combo.  thats because some of the prettiest people have it. thats why  automatically think its pretty.    megan fox, adriana lima  see what i mean?|`|PFbbKJH0aa	when those 3 qualities are combined, it usually makes for a wow-inducing person. not always gorgeous, but all their features just seem to be more prominent. its an incorrect assumption made by a lot of people|`|53NFQqKwaa	I either think they're probably pretty   or that they're pale and sickly looking.

mgkxDLmIaa	okay , wow this is so much like mine.   When i had gotten my ears done i could not wait to take them out , my date to switch them was the day after christmas . Like you , i followed the ear cleaning routine and the schedule but  i was so so anxious that i removed them the MORNING after christmas and i could not get it back it  , it wasn't that the hole was closed it was that i missed the hole and i freaked out . So i would wait a little after 6 weeks like a week or so after just to be sure , especially being your ears are sensitive . Now i can wear any earing ( but just keep like the studded backs in for 6 months they say )|`|EPVW8Ukeaa	Yeah you should be fine. Just to warn you though, it's quite difficult to put in the first earrings because it's hard to find the hole and stuff.

7yRGUtgMaa	Could spike it with gel.  You could spike it in the back and let it lay in front, or spike the whole thing. Or you could just let it lay and go for a mop look.

You could try putting lemon juice and going in the sun. I think it would be best just to dye it though

5IPZ7w2caa	Wait until you are 18 then pierce away...|`|mgkxDLmIaa	No , do not do it by your self , that could be why it is getting infected . go to like claires , thats where i got mine done and they did a greta job ,|`|Fw6QvL25aa	go to a tattoo shop mama.|`|tYlQPsIUaa	Don't do it by yourself, and DON'T go to Claire's. Piercing guns are NOT supposed to be used on piercings other than the lobes, but they shouldn't even be used on those.    Do some research. Find stories, look up terminology, print pictures, look at jewelry... Show your mother that you are determined to get this done. Show her that you would be able to care for it and treat it kindly by cleaning every taking and taking responsibility for it. Remember, this is your body, and she'll make you regret that you got it if you get an infection.    Here are some sites to start you off:    General info: http://wiki.bmezine.com/index.php/Helix_...    How to take care of it: http://wiki.bmezine.com/index.php/Catego...   (This one may help with the reoccurring infections in your lobes right now.)    Body jewelry: http://www.bodyartforms.com/  (Look at the "About body jewelry" section here: http://www.bodyartforms.com/faqs.asp)    Pictures: http://bmezine.com/pierce/01-ear/cart001...    Stories: http://bmezine.com/pierce/01-ear/bme-pg0...    A great site to start off with as well: http://www.safepiercing.org/    Good luck. Be mature, and if she says no wait a while. If you decided to stick a safety pin through your ear, not only would it hurt like hell, it would most likely have many complications. Make sure they only use a hollow needle, and not a piercing gun when/if you get it done.    P.S.  Walmart = BAD! EVIL! Piercing studio that's professional, clean, and friendly = AMAZING! The point is, try to find a professional. Even if they're 2 hours, or 3 hours away, a good job can go a long way.
5PVFXry8aa	Skin Exfoliant  Rubbing your skin with Coffee ground extract seems silly but it is actually a good idea. The extract removes dead skin cells, which results in better-looking skin. It can save you hundreds of dollars since this simple product can practically replacesseveral pricey sessions with your dermatologist.      Hair Shine Solution  Lets face it, everyone wants to have shiny and bouncy hair. Some people spend significant amounts of cash just to make their hair look better. You can look no further than your supply of used coffee grounds to give you softer and shinier hair. Just wash your hair with the coffee byproduct and rinse. You will soon sport your favorite celebrity hairstyle after a few strokes    Cellulite-Used coffee grounds get rid of cellulite. Here is the recipe I found at DIY Maven. "Mix 1/4 cup warm, used coffee grounds and one tablespoon of olive oil. While standing over an old towel or newspaper, apply the mixture to your problem areas. Next, wrap the areas with shrink wrap and leave on for several minutes. Unwind the wrap, brush loose grounds off your skin and then shower with warm water. For best results, it is recommended to repeat this procedure twice a week."     hope that help!

TBRMH4hbaa	Yup. If theres no hole, or infection on the inside then it's ready. Feel it and if theres a little ball on the inside of your skin then thats infection and it's not ready. But keep in mind piercing it again, it'll be through scar tissue this time and hurt a lot more.|`|rnUr1JJ7aa	yea u can get it pierced again because i had mine pierce at one point then it didnt heal up right so i took it out and let it close now it kinda hard and a little dark i heard that it will hurt worst the 2nd time because the tissue have already been damage but yes u can get it

I would suggest showering a lot earlier that night though if you do try it because it takes a long time for your hair to dry when it's in a bun and it will only really work if your hair is totally dry when you take it out of the bun.|`|xbqYQYs3aa	here is what i do i put a mouse and gel in my hand and scrunch do that continuously. then shake your hair out and continue scrunching it until it drys. : D|`|Eqh1enw6aa	After washing your hair-while it's still damp tie it in buns. This creates bouncy waves.  If your going to have your hair in braids, I would suggest using gel on damp hair and doing several braids. Mouse is great if your ready to style it just before going out.
4oQs4lJ3aa	Sam answers your question oddly now doesn't she! ? Sorry. Your a boy so I am sure short hair would look just fine but it seems off! Your hair needs a trim.

v5J50Ep2aa	well don't go somewhere where its too cheap, if its more expensive then it will probably be done better! make sure you go to a Professional who knows what their doing! and no you should use a belly button ring that they give you because it is sterile and it will be a ring that will be easy to clean! good luck!
4zvwKkuaaa	MAybe you can deep-condtion, or use a leave-in treatment that will take away the frizziness. Or maybe you can trim your hair/ make your hair thinner, so there'd be less frizziness.|`|f6d1a03e184c22ee41b0717f7c9d38feaa	shave it off, that will take care of the problem|`|0405893528ec8866808fd4b76dad4bd1aa	well i think you need to start taking showers in the morning and get up a little earlier, that way you have time to blowdry and/or style.

Lol|`|8to6MsWuaa	forever 21,   deb  delias    those stores all have really cute dresses. also try  macy's|`|1cXXFBX9aa	okayyy so im in grade nine and last year i had confirmation and grad as well first go to Queen St. some boutiques there are great and you can find unique dresses...and here are dos and donts  DO  -try to aim for straps not many have strapless and its really showy for just grade eight grad  -dont get too over the top (everyone says oh yah my dress is this and that but most is simple)  -get the bottom flowy so when u dance is goes out a bit(stunning) and tight, but a good material to breathe by the times u have to sit, and dancin gets hot (temperature wise)    DONT  -get heels honestly get a hot pair of flats or mini heels everyone takes them off and all that time u spent trying to find the right shoes out the window bc they hurt to dance in  - get a big design try to stay with solids for grade eight     i hope that helps...im not trying to squash fun but i was soo disappointed with my heels I could barey walk in them i worked them in before AND they were essentially comfy..u can can look ur best modestly while looking really HOT!|`|0Ob6cp4Kaa	Gojane.com|`|eicQTpKyaa	papaya has the cutest dresses ever!  they olny have sizes small, med & large tho!
5qIOzchwaa	alcohol will strip the color out but will also strip your hair. I would try this website:http://haircrazy.info/gallery/  btw what's wrong with fun colored hair? why is it a mistake to have it that way... you can always dye again. You can use this color removal kit it has peroxide in it but it's not as damaging as bleach. it's by clairol color zap or something.|`|e9254dfe3cf4f28d0fd90326f20ed636aa	My hair was Dark brown with Pink.  The only way to really get black out is using a stripper if you dont want to bleach it.   Stripper isnt that great for hair but you could always strip it and go a light brown color.   You are not going to get back to your naturaly color the only way to do that is letting your hair grow.|`|EBlmNQvUaa	you probably have to either  a- dye it a color close to your natural color or  b- go through a costly color stripping of your hair.
fZ2fFhe8aa	Overall i'd say about 11 times a day.    I look in the mirror a few times just in the morning,   and then in school i use my friends mirror and look in it.  Then I go to look in the mirrors in the bathroom, and then   again a period after that.   Then , a few times when i'm at my house.   :D haha|`|bEypuYJ0aa	I don't know...too much.  I feel so narcissistic.|`|rHKW1CJJaa	eeek sometimes too much... its a endorphins and confidence boost (sometimes)|`|O0S189PQaa	too much i think =[|`|B06MKPbfaa	I look in the mirror a lot didn't use to though|`|IsQckOXraa	alot  i sound really vain, but when ever i see a mirror i have to look in it  not because i "check my self out", but like hummmmmmmm  i really don't know why it's just, comforting?|`|Ovr8bQ1paa	probably like 10. i do A LOT in the morning so i can make sure everything is staying good. then at school whenever i go to the bathroom or walk by a show case(i look in the glass) and then at night when i get in my pjs and brush my teeth and stuff|`|f86luyi7aa	wow....  ummm yeah i cant count   like the girl above i look alot at myself in the morning to make sure everything is good.  then like 6 times at school in the bathroom mirror and then a lot when i get home  so uhhh....  hmm 20. yeah i know thats alot but i like looking at myself!
uJJPFJoyaa	Depends on you , there are different styles of jewelry to choose from your helix can either take a hoop, barbel or stud and your rook can either be a hoop or barbel, choose what ever style suits you best. My right ear has 3 ear lobe holes, tragus and rook piercing, left ear I have 2 ear lobe holes and tragus piercing. I don't think its look crowded or "too much" because of the style of jewelry I chose. Good Luck.|`|QVrEEmFHaa	I don't think it would look bad, but it might look a little crowded. If I were you I'd get it on the other ear :-]|`|FDBJs1lOaa	I think you should do whatever suits you best but I personally think that it would look better on your other ear so that it does not look unbalanced! good luck :)|`|GukaCWemaa	Nah i think that's fine.|`|LuTjBw4Laa	owwww! thats gonna hurttt

AA11161570	Well i browsed through your questions  and it seems like you used to have a weight problem, and now that you have lost that weight your outter appearance has greatly improved and thats why your getting so much attention from these girls.    The thing is though, it doesn't seem like your mind has changed much.  If you don't see yourself as attractive then the people who interact with you won't    Thats why most of the people saying you are hot are more or less strangers; while the people at school still see you as that guy with low self esteem perhaps.    My best advice is to appreciate yourself more; and since you are already hot, accept that, and improve your self esteeem.    Girls will flock to you ;)  esspecially if you stay sweet sincere respectful and polite!|`|MbFS6XFQaa	lol if you don't have balls, you're probably too young to be on this site :D|`|nkjFsi4uaa	youve probably been dating unattractive girls cuz you dont have enough confidence in yourself and dont think that you can find anything better. start to look at yourself in a more postive way and youll build up confidence and start attracting better looking girls.|`|53NFQqKwaa	They're probably just nervous.    Some girls are just as nervous as guys when it comes to asking people out. Also, a lot of girls want guys to make the first move. {I know you can't but maybe you could drop hints at some special girl and she'd ask you}    Hope that helped!
2oN7WrVKaa	Im going to give you the links to the BEST drugstore foundation you can find.  I know a lot of people say that this stuff is bad because its, "cheap" but it works better then a lot of my other name brands. Ive never broken out, it doesnt overdry my skin.  And it has a really nice color.    First I conceal using this:  http://www.maybelline.com/Product/Face/C...  Its great for red spots, and undereye circles especially.  Its a little lighter then your skin tone, but foundation will even it all out.    My foundation:  http://www.maybelline.com/Product/Face/F...  This gives my skin the most beautiful glow! I had been using another product from Elizabeth Arden, and the color matched my skin tone, but it was really bland. This one is vibrant and really illuminates your face. I had put it on the other side of my sponge and the difference was incredable.    Finishing:  http://www.lorealparisusa.com/_us/_en/de...  This brings everything together.  It covers any discoloring of the face and smoothes everything out.  Its got great coverage.  It is a little messy though.|`|r4xRkqzdaa	make up forever HD foundation    my skin is really fair, so i have problems getting an exact color match with those crappy drugstore foundations and make up forever is perfect for me.  it is made of silicon molecules that are too big to clog up in you pores  so i won't cause u to break out.  it provides perfect buildable coverage    it's a professional product, so it's a little pricy, but after getting a product this perfect, i could never think of going to anythign else: http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...  of course, unlike a drugstore foundation you can try it out and get color matched before you buy it so u know u got the perfect one|`|vnOz03Aaaa	i love covergirl tru blend. it comes in all different shades. it's about 10.00 but i think it's worth it.|`|GTag2cCiaa	http://www.makeupalley.com/product/searc...    this website is very helpful to me. it has review on different makeup products. high end products and drug store ones too.     and the reviews are done by everyday people too. and it shows the percentage of people that would buy the product again.     and make sure you look at the reviewer's skin type because certain products work better with certain skin types    hope this helps!|`|6febee8b4757d9cd4857176f7b29c818aa	Liquid Foundation from Maybelline New York:    http://www.maybelline.com/Product/Face/F...
5qIOzchwaa	it just has to be really big and put a head band or a bow in there and you're good to go. You can tease and stuff, that's the only way to do it short and 80s, unless you wanna attempt a faux hawk. Those are hard to pull off though. or just straighten the longer parts and make the back as poofy/spikey as possible|`|hVZkMkqVaa	are you talking about something like this? http://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc140...    f you are, scoop it into a side pony, push in a headband, and viola!    and if you're talking about this.. http://i218.photobucket.com/albums/cc140...  then you'll need a mullet.    sorry i didn't help more, but i bet if you provided a picture of what you're looking for, it would be easier to answer.     mine?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...

FxBcccS6aa	Go to the dermatoligist they will give you a perscription for a good acne  cream. also you could try toothpaste untill then. I hope they go away.|`|S730dpLfaa	Kelly, I could finally find a solution for this problem,read this blog before taking any action  http://finallyigotridofacne.wordpress.co...  Thanks to this blog, it helped me a lot to find the best teeth whitening method.  Hope this helps|`|553c27203d06a734ee6db4154b6d5b2caa	Go to the dermatologist!!!! I had been using Proactiv for the past 3-4 years, thinking it was helping my face... HAHAHA!! I went to the dermatologist and the nurse practitioner put me on acne topicals (Differin and Duac- they're prescription only) and they told me to wash my face with CeraVe Cleanser and apply CeraVe lotion. I love that cleanser!!! It keeps my face from drying out. You can get it at most pharmacies and Walmart. You may have to ask for it behind the counter at some places. After I did a course of acne topicals and my face still wasn't getting much better, the nurse practitioner sent me to the dermatologist to be put on Accutane. Accutane is just a pill that you take for a couple months straight and it gets rid of your acne. It is a very annoying medicine though. It completely dries out all of your skin so I have to constantly apply moisturizer. Also, it has really nasty side effects such as depression and birth defects. You have to visit the dermatologist every month, and if you're a girl you need to be on birth control and get pregnancy tests every month. Its highly regulated, but it's definitely worth going through all the trouble if it clears up all your acne. Currently, I am almost done with my Accutane treatment before the dermatologist puts me back on topicals. My face is very clear. I hope that all this helped and you are not too confused. Oh... another topical I used in the beginning until insurance wouldn't cover was Tazorac. Good luck with your acne!!!! It really can get better, believe it or not!!|`|KQq4BqkFaa	see a dermatologist about it. they'll be way more helpful then most can. don't try to pop them or anything. that could make them worse.   (fyi--if you get them on your forehead nose and chin, or "T" zone, it's common, that tends to be the oilest parts on your face. try keeping some oil absorbing wipes with you to keep the exsess oil down.)|`|YwHl37Hgaa	You can try this crush 1to 2 Aspirin tablets mix with a little water and apply on pimples for 15 minutes and wash. More such solutions at http://solutionsforpimples.blogspot.com/|`|Gv606uKbaa	my favorite facial wash is the apricot scrub by st. ives!  i wash my face with it every day and voila! no pimples.  sometimes it can almost dry out your face too much though so   you might have to apply moisturizer with it if that happens|`|OFNmZbPCaa	you need to go to a dermatologist immediately, they could be infected. don't put make-up on them because that could make it worse!|`|3OL7vVLuaa	Pro-Active may work for you. Or sometimes they put girls on birth control pills -- because that evens out your hormones and it could be your hormonal changes causing the acne. They cleared my acne up completely!
AA10358331	If you tell yourself that you are beautiful, no matter what your stomach looks like. You will start believing in yourself. Self Confidence is one of the most beautiful things a girl can have. This isn't going to happen over night, but tell your self over and over. Find something good on your body that you think looks hot and accent that.   I'm a little chubby, but i have pretty eyes and a chest that can make any man want me..lol.  So i play up my eyes and my chest and i don't worry about my stomach. I look at my self and i tell me self that I look hot and my husband is lucky to have such a beautiful wife. It works, my self confidence shines and every one notices.   Until then, wear shirts with an empire waist, that hides a tummy. Also darker clothes, it will hide any misshapes.|`|GJ9xgrx7aa	it might sound silly but running. it's the safest, easiest and healthiest way to tone your body all around. and it'll make your tummy tight and looking goood. :] hope i helped.|`|rmnUrL35aa	look,i know your worried bout ur stomach but i wouldnt worry about it too much.If someone has said something about ur stomach shape ignore them or something.But if your really freakin out just wear a baggy sweatshirt.That worked for me when i got fat.|`|myVECzQZaa	you can do some ab workouts, that will help you with your stomach.. or if your really busy you can get these fat reducer injuections.. they attack the fat in your mid section.. there liek $2000.00 for 5 sessions.    hope i helped.|`|dfyC4Qipaa	Im going threw the same thing right now!

TBRMH4hbaa	If it still stings after a week, then somethings wrong and you must take it out !    But right now it's still pretty fresh, and I'm sure she flips it up and down a lot to hide it so it's irritated. Tell your friend not to touch it except for when she's cleaning it.|`|U7vLYGodaa	its normal, mine did that|`|FDBJs1lOaa	The stinging is completely normal. Just tell her to keep cleaning it and avoid hitting it on anything or sleeping on it. Good luck :)
ih1ruMENaa	I'd recommend Bobby Brown Creamy Concealer. It's a cream, as the name suggests, which will provide full coverage, and also has a yellow-base, so it will counteract any dark areas under the eyes, making you look more awake. The luminescence will reflect light, de-emphasizing any protusion in the skin caused by bags. http://www.bobbibrowncosmetics.com/templ...    Other ways to look more awake are to use white eyeliner on the inner rim of the eye, an eyelash curler or to creating 'wings' out from the outer corners of your of eyes when applying eyeliner, like in this picture: http://images.smarter.com/blogs/liner2.J...|`|GTag2cCiaa	Concealer, concealer, concealer.    all products work differently on people but here are some reviews that could help you pick one    http://www.makeupalley.com/product/searc...|`|fcea290916cc52285e14fcbaed7d4320aa	COVER GIRL TRUE BLEND CONCEALER

On http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1099/6685... is that Jonathan Jackson.|`|6FkNcB91aa	in both of those pics their hair just looks greasy and in one partially wet. sorry.|`|Wb6n7RyIaa	you might just wana throw a little mousse into your hair. that should do the job. its like hairspray mixed with gel. and just fluff your hair a little.  :D|`|Hlz3mXNvaa	put moose in your hair .   and then comb threw it with a thin comb|`|Prq0QuLfaa	moose, use Tresemme|`|XU6SxUbDaa	lots of gel and btw second picture looks CUTE!|`|3NoO12cuaa	hello,    you helped me so my turn :) ok so use moose and put very small amounts of hair inbetween ALL your fingers even thum.then use 3 sprays of surf N sun hair spray for guys/girls.    Hope it helps!|`|HryOaixWaa	put some gel in it then comb through it with a wide tooth comb it will piece it out
h1HyWqqeaa	You can add grease to your hair if you want but not alot...  it wont make your hair unnatural|`|Gh72E4cAaa	That's gross, no offense.|`|6FkNcB91aa	your prolly making it straighter by putting grease in it. and unless you do it right it prolly makes it look like you havent washed your hair in a while.|`|st0B4ChSaa	maybe it is the grease that makes it not the way you would like.  try maybe a week without using the grease, but use conditioner while you shower. this will keep your hair smooth and stop snarls if you get them.  when you use it, the first time use it close to your scalp, but from then on, use only at the last three or four inches of your hair - depending on length.  if you have short hair, use the conditioner every three days, message into your scalp.    hope i helped =]|`|eop8XnmKaa	I have never heard of anyone adding grease to their head. I would say just shampoo and condition. Your scalp should be fine and if it is dry then use a special shampoo like Head and Shoulders Classic Clean. That's what the shampoo is made for. Also that probably is the reason y your hair isnt as wavy/curly. NO GREASE!|`|Xe94coYQaa	Yes, it is making it unnatural.
553c27203d06a734ee6db4154b6d5b2caa	I wouldn't pop your zits if you can help it. It scars your face... trust me... I know from experience. I just answered a question on acne for another person. I told them what I have been through in getting rid of acne and I'm just going to paste it here because I don't feel like typing it all over again. Good luck!!    Go to the dermatologist!!!! I had been using Proactiv for the past 3-4 years, thinking it was helping my face... HAHAHA!! I went to the dermatologist and the nurse practitioner put me on acne topicals (Differin and Duac- they're prescription only) and they told me to wash my face with CeraVe Cleanser and apply CeraVe lotion. I love that cleanser!!! It keeps my face from drying out. You can get it at most pharmacies and Walmart. You may have to ask for it behind the counter at some places. After I did a course of acne topicals and my face still wasn't getting much better, the nurse practitioner sent me to the dermatologist to be put on Accutane. Accutane is just a pill that you take for a couple months straight and it gets rid of your acne. It is a very annoying medicine though. It completely dries out all of your skin so I have to constantly apply moisturizer. Also, it has really nasty side effects such as depression and birth defects. You have to visit the dermatologist every month, and if you're a girl you need to be on birth control and get pregnancy tests every month. Its highly regulated, but it's definitely worth going through all the trouble if it clears up all your acne. Currently, I am almost done with my Accutane treatment before the dermatologist puts me back on topicals. My face is very clear. I hope that all this helped and you are not too confused. Oh... another topical I used in the beginning until insurance wouldn't cover was Tazorac. Good luck with your acne!!!! It really can get better, believe it or not!!|`|tao83sDxaa	yes witch hazel. don't pop a zit, they are infections and it only makes it worse. put witch hazel on a q tip and apply it to the spot. for heavens sake don't put makeup on it, it is a good way of getting germs in it. it is going to take time for the new skin to become your regular shade, but it will. as you get older, your hormones will start to calm down. acne is because your hormones are unbalanced, and everyones system is different. hang in there your face is going to look beautiful.|`|sn9T7nfraa	i once got told use clear eyes. Place bottle in fridge and then when ready to use put it on a cotton tip and dab on red areas. give it a try.|`|cfKXshe3aa	dont put any product on it it just makes it even redder just let it calm over night and put some cool water or even and ice cube on it or a little vasaline works too trust mee experience............ all of the above combined work the best hope i helped :)|`|IKEvHsLSaa	put a bag over your head|`|d3icrU62aa	put ice on it...the swelling and redness should go out|`|x9cM3hJiaa	put visine on it. or any stuff you put in your eyes to remove the redness. it works wonders! use it all the time! :] hope that helps|`|Iv3QRoZiaa	You can try putting some visine on a cotton ball and holding it on the spot for a minute or two. If the spot isn't real bad it clears up the redness.|`|W0K9QqEDaa	I know it sounds funny but toothpaste will get the job done everytime.

Just a slight darkness.|`|5494oeMhaa	tan :) its attractive when a guy has a hint of color to his skin
hLdIO43Xaa	YES YES YES! What are these other answerers talking about? Gladiators are SO in! It's only winter right now, but wait until it gets to spring! Sure, there are such things as not-so-pretty-gladiators, but some are really, really gorgeous.  This summer of 2009 is all about the "grecian goddess" look, which means flowy tops/dresses and definitely gladiator sandals!  In fact, Charlotte Russe is featuring "summer sandals" online and gladiators are in!    Fashionising has an entire article about 2009's grecian look  "Who Designed It  Classical one-shoulder draping graced the runways of Elie Saab, Valentino and others, while Kenzo's dresses had more of a Romanesque tunic feel to them.    How to wear it  Make use of the ongoing gladiator sandals trend of course! Pair a more casual Grecian dress with flat, buckled sandals, or a lush flowing gown with strappy heeled shoes. If the dress is plain, team it up with some exotic statement jewellery to bring it well into 2009.    Celebrities who are wearing the trend  Rihanna in a Gucci one-shoulder goddess dress    Mischa Barton in a Matthew Williamson Goddess Dress    Mischa Barton: Grecian dress, military jacket    Kate Beckinsale is a Grecian Goddess    Sienna Miller's simple Grecian dress"  http://www.fashionising.com/trends/b--Gr...|`|Ot2AERbcaa	not really but be yourself:)|`|GqEAun7Baa	No and they never should have been. We're not gladiators! Well at least the majority of us aren't. There may be a few creepers out there who are.|`|VrjF986Aaa	not really i mean i guess they are played out like it was cool last summer but now it's too mainstream so if you are on top of fashion don't get them|`|0405893528ec8866808fd4b76dad4bd1aa	Not to be mean or anything,  but no they are not.|`|cxVmq2kraa	Yeah I believe so.|`|FLmctyJ0aa	Yes they are. Boho is defintately still in    Also, wedges are going be in this season two    My two favorite types of shoes!|`|gh2FdQ7waa	i don't think so    i don't think they should've been either  cause no offense if you like them    but they were ugggggllyyy|`|0MuIRH1uaa	not really its winter!|`|bKkHW5lbaa	Yes, they are really cute I have some myself:)|`|Lrrwu7yzaa	They are still "in"  but i would never wear them.  But they still are going to be out this season.|`|amV1eCQcaa	There still 'in' but going 'out'  i personally have always thought they were kinda ugly anyway.|`|lXbyPBQCaa	yes! they are going to get a lot more popular this spring/summer, i'm sure of it (at least i hope so cause i really want some)!|`|uCsu1VYgaa	They'll be back for spring. Obviously the first few answers believe them to be "out" because they haven't seen them for a while. Which would make sense considering this is February. It's cold this time of year in most parts of the world. They will still be perfectly acceptable to wear for the upcoming spring and summer months.|`|KuKB0kfEaa	in high fashion yes, but for everyday clothes no.
Y4HKumx9aa	Dont.    If you decide to use hair dye at any point before that has grown out it could mess it up, and i think henna is only blue/black/red, well last time i checked

5wDjXzSraa	Wrist tattoos are a "druggie" thing? Lordamercy. So what does that make completely covered? I guess I better sign up for rehab quick.     My shoulder blades didn't bother me (both are done).     I've seen women with their vajayjays tattooed. Trashy is relative - it depends on WHAT the tattoo itself is and where it's located. Trashy to one person may not be trashy to another. Stop being concerned about what's "trashy" and get what you want, where you want. To some, ALL tattoos are "trashy". It's simply a matter of opinion. You just have to decide if it's yours or someone elses that counts more.     What IS trashy: stereotyping.|`|AoUUfzXgaa	We all know about the lower back tattoos reffered to as tramp stamps! A shoulder blade tattoo isn't too trashy but is getting popular...I haven't gotten a shoulder blade tat and don't plan to but my cousin did and she said that it hurt alot.|`|8c56e64a8f1b90a7291b8613f7c9b797aa	I pride myself on being a bogan analyser.   The worst i see are on boobs, lower back and centre of the shoulder.  A good idea is to get one small enough that can be covered with a bandaid or small bandage. Like on your foot or ankle|`|hiY7CCc7aa	Don't put it anywhere on your chest  Very trashy  Lower back, shoulders and ankles are nice and "sexy"|`|buiZHOG1aa	First off, there is no such thing as a trashy place for a tattoo! And as for where to put a tattoo, it really depends on what it is.|`|4qmCOBL8aa	tramp stamps!|`|dMLtCenLaa	I have a tattoo right about my left ankle (on the outside), and I love it! You can cover it with pants, socks, whatever. But in the summer, you can show it off with a cute pair of sandals.|`|3sCrTA1Raa	ankle|`|4lqwMnhJaa	upper arm would be good. if you wanted to show it off, you could wear a sleeveless or just pull up your sleeves but if you wanted to hide it, you could wear a short-sleeved t-shirt.|`|GLEGh4N0aa	boobs and back. proper wrong.|`|7DtfYx20aa	not ur but lol|`|DpStw8RBaa	I don't think any area on a woman is a trashy place for a tattoo. It's the way a woman carries herself that makes her trashy. I know many women who are covered with tattoos and they are some of the classiest women I know. I have three tattoos myself, all on my back, and I don't think they're trashy at all. One of my tattoos is in the "horrid" tramp stamp location, but that's just a gross generalization and I think it's a generalization that needs to be dropped.     The tattoo on my shoulder blade was the least painful of my three and that's usually the location that I recommend to people who are considering tattoos.|`|HvHBF8glaa	Her private spots if you know what i mean!|`|Gh72E4cAaa	Don't put it anywhere on your wrists, or ankle. Maybe on your shoulder, or on the side of your stomach. If you know what I mean?|`|4Q1asqr5aa	sholder,arm,wrist,leg,skin! dont tattoo ull regret it wen ur old and all tats r tramp stamps|`|qfe5GOcMaa	**** vagina|`|LBHJaqXoaa	Since when did wrist tattoos become a druggie thing? I don't think tattoos on anyone anywhere are trashy. It's the way the woman acts and dresses that makes her trashy.    A tattoo across your shoulder blade would hurt but not that much. It would be tolerable. I mean, you already know tattoos hurt. Since the shoulder blade is a more meaty, fleshy area, then it will hurt less than your wrist or ankle.
nRB121B9aa	I think if you got your brows waxed or plucked them a little and with your pixie look you'd look shweet with platinum blonde like Gwen Stefani.|`|zNhUBErCaa	Brown would be cute. OH!

OEMIkJTUaa	I have personally used Proactiv, and I would say that the Refining mask is the better choice. You will be able to use the mask as a mask, and as a spot treatment before bed. It is very potent, and really works well with the other 3 daily steps. I use the mask about 2 times a week. The moisturizer is a good product, but you can live without it.|`|MvwO94xAaa	the green tea moisterizer because the refining mask gets rid of the acne , but leaves scars, so ur face is scarred for life  proactive itself can dry out ur skin, and its hard to find a moisterizer to help, so the green tea moisterizer is awesome  therefore, ur road to recovery from acne with the green tea moisterizer would be making ur skin prettier and clearer, while with the refining mask, it makes it dry and flaky

WFU5JCV0aa	I am around your age and also have skin issues...I've found that when I stopped trying so hard to get rid of everything, it clears itself up. I'm currently using Neutrogena products morning and night. My makeup is Bare Escentuals mineral foundation, and it is fantastic, it covers yet doesn't clog my pores and cause more breakouts. I have light skin also, and it makes my face look more natural than other foundations.    Another product I use when I've got a breakout is Yuva Active Clearing Gel.|`|QovnMnbNaa	Every day I wash my face with Clean and Clear foamy acne wash (the purple one), then I apply benzoyl peroxide liquid from acne free, when that is dry, I use Wet n Wild concealer over my face and top it off with covergirl pressed powder and wet n wild silk finish blush.|`|fnyZ7Se2aa	Well, I'm 15 and I'm Asian, but tanned since my parents immigrated from Cambodia, and to be honest, my skin's not that great!    On average, I use pro-active with the refining mask (it works for me surprisingly!) once if my day isn't that busy or twice if i felt like its been a long day. The refining mask i use on my face twice a week for 10 minutes.    At night, if I see pimples appearing or its around "that time of the month" i dab the refining mask right on them and sleep and the next morning its close to or completely gone.    Redoing the routine over again, i also use a clean and clear face moisturizer for my face lotion and it works great, if I put it on every now and then to re-moisturize my face, it keeps it smooth and doesn't interfere with the pro-active cleansing routine.    I keep a box of tea bags too along with the tea leaves we have and I put them in the refrigerator, not the freezer, and use them on my eyes at night for 30 minutes of sleeping (although when i wake up, they are obviously not on my eyes) so I go to sleep on my back (even though that induces snoring, which thank god, I don't snore).    But yeah, I'm around your tone of skin, so we need more "demanding products" Neutrogena works good too! Oh and with a cleanser (preferably with beads or pumice stone in them) and also an ELECTRIC toothbrush, just put some on it and scrub your face with the toothbrush, of course I have to reapply the cleanser on several times on the toothbrush, or put the cleanser on your face, smooth it around and then use the toothbrush to help clean it. It helps a lot!    Mineral powder and makeup that is light yet still has a good duration are good too. Sometimes they'll some with more money needed, but Sephora  (their brand and the brands they host) and some drugstore brands are great (Covergirl!!!)    Don't wah your face too much,  Don't be to stressed out,   Make a good workout/yoga routine,  and this all can help you look great and feel good too!|`|QwXIsKAhaa	Well, face wash I use neutrogena(if that's how u spell it) the foaming clenser, witch hazel for toner and this face moisturiser my uncle buys for my mum. Is pretty good, it smoothen out my sking and gotton rid of the scars on my face.a aahhah    Day time make-up  Natio face cream, then a wait for a while and put sunscreen on.  I use MAC studio tech (just abit) as concealer,  Then Natio mineral loose powder foundation, the dustit off with MAC blotting powder  A bit of MAC blushcreme,  Clinique brown eyeshadow (I don't know the name)  Lip balm and I just curl my eye lash.  Takes like 10min max.    Night time  Moisturise using the same thing,  MAC studio tech and studio fix fluid. (As foundation and concealer)  MAC blotting powder, the MAC blush creme,   I then use revlon beyond cream eye shadow, MAC fluidline for my top eye lid and their eye kohl for my bottom. I then use the MAC carbon eyeshadow to help smudge it and make the eyeliner last longer. Currently using Napoleon perdis mascara.....not that good ahaha, lipbalm and I'm off, takes about a good 30min max.
9RABAkjOaa	Proactiv but you have to use it the right way, do exactly what the directions say.|`|0405893528ec8866808fd4b76dad4bd1aa	well i use proactiv,  everyone sais its bad and all,  but thats because they dont use it the right way.  you use it twice daily not any more or less,  and you just use a little bit of it, not a penny sized,  only pea sized.  it works so good :]  i've been using it for a year now,  and i have no pimples at all,  but i warn you that,  the first 2 weeks you start using it,  the product will bring out all of the acne on your face,  because it got rid of the top layer of skin and acne,  so it is revealing what is underneith,  but if you continue to use it,  after a few weeks you will definietley notice the difference.|`|9PRuDHHsaa	neutrogena    proactive doesnt ******* work for anyone -.-|`|fnyZ7Se2aa	actually both are really good, but since my pimples used to be so bad, i settled for pro-active. nuetrogena is more for like clearing out the face while proactive targets on clearing out the face :) but both have good products.|`|pPI04R8saa	neutrogena for sure!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...  proactive does not work at all!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|KGpuN5vlaa	neither.

Well, if you can't find others, then I suggest you just buy the one that you found on that website. Its simple, elegant and not over the top.

It's probably cheaper that way AND it will have more meaning to it :).|`|824Md65waa	I honestly think you should reconsider Forever21.  It's probably one of the only places you will be able to find a similar dress that is cheaper.  I was in there this past weekend and they almost had an identicle dress.  The style was the same, but the pattern in the material was different.  It also came in some nice colors like purple, navy, teel and I think a warm pinky color too.|`|TAB84QSxaa	Why not buy a long red one it would look cute on you, it is only $30.00.|`|VRZKHqbkaa	go for that one...prom dresses are really expensive and thats a great dress, if you have to, macy's MIGHT have one on sale, but it wont be as cute

Doctors will suggest it for healing minor scratches and for skin which opens up on your fingers in cold weather .  You can also take it as a vitamin in gelcaps to improve your skin.|`|0405893528ec8866808fd4b76dad4bd1aa	Yes. this is how it helps:  Vitamin E is a fat-soluble vitamin that exists in eight different forms. Each form has its own biological activity, which is the measure of potency or functional use in the body [1]. Alpha-tocopherol (-tocopherol) is the name of the most active form of vitamin E in humans. It is also a powerful biological antioxidant [2-3]. Vitamin E in supplements is usually sold as alpha-tocopheryl acetate, a form of alpha-tocopherol that protects its ability to function as an antioxidant. The synthetic form is labeled "D, L" while the natural form is labeled "D". The synthetic form is only half as active as the natural form [4].     Antioxidants such as vitamin E act to protect your cells against the effects of free radicals, which are potentially damaging by-products of energy metabolism. Free radicals can damage cells and may contribute to the development of cardiovascular disease and cancer. Studies are underway to determine whether vitamin E, through its ability to limit production of free radicals, might help prevent or delay the development of those chronic diseases. Vitamin E has also been shown to play a role in immune function, in DNA repair, and other metabolic processes [2-3].   Vegetable oils, nuts, green leafy vegetables, and fortified cereals are common food sources of vitamin E in the United States (U.S.). Table 1, Selected Food Sources of Vitamin E, suggests many food sources of vitamin E [4]. Food values are listed in the alpha-tocopherol form of vitamin E.      but it still kind of helps the skin in this way:  Antioxidant     First of all, because of its antioxidant activity, vitamin e is vital in protecting skin cells from ultra violet light, pollution, drugs, and other elements that produce cell damaging free radicals. It is believed that vitamin e is most effective in its natural alcohol form rather than its acetate form where it is a less effective antioxidant. Watch for this in the labelling of skin care products.       Regulator for Vitamin A     The benefits of vitamin e for healthy skin care also include its ability to regulate vitamin a in the body, which itself is important for healthy skin.     Anti-Aging Benefits of Vitamin E     Vitamin e added to lotions, creams, and other skin care products, as well as taken orally, plays a role in the anti-aging of skin. It helps skin look younger by reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Also, free radicals are believed to play an important role in skin aging and therefore the antioxidant activity is quite valuable for this skin problem.     Sun Protection and Sun Burn Treatment     Vitamin e lotions provide some benefit in preventing and treating sunburns. These lotions protect the epidermis layer of the skin from early stages of ultra violet light damage. Vitamin e preparations also increase the effectiveness of sunscreens. Such lotions do not work immediately. They must be applied about 20 minutes before sun exposure in order to allow the vitamin e to be absorbed deep into the epidermis layer.       Treatment of Skin Diseases     Vitamin e can aid in the treatment of various skin diseases or skin conditions. Topical applications such as those used to treat psoriasis is one of the benefits of vitamin e. Orally ingested vitamin e can help treat erythema (a skin inflammation that results in reddish, painful, and tender lumps).     Treatment of Scars     This is one of the more controversial benefits of vitamin e. Initially, it was thought that vitamin e was very beneficial in the prevention and treatment of scarring (acne scars or surgical scars) and healing of skin from various forms of damage such as burns. Some recent research has questioned this benefit of vitamin e. In fact some studies have indicated that vitamin e creams do not help prevent surgical scarring and may actually make the scar look worse. This is in opposition to the experience of a number of individuals that claim vitamin e creams help soften the appearance of scars.     Skin Cancer     One of the most important benefits of vitamin e is the prevention of skin cancer. This occurs because of its sun protection quality and of course its powerful antioxidant properties, which help reduce or prevent sun damage.       Other     There are a variety of other benefits of vitamin e for skin care:       vitamin e products help reduce the appearance of stretch marks   vitamin e can help prevent the appearance of age spots   it helps maintain the skins oil balance during the cleansing process   it reduces transepidermal water loss from skin and strengthens the skins barrier function       Overall for skin care, more benefit is obtained from topical application of vitamin e through creams or lotions rather than taking vitamin e orally. Skin is able to absorb natural vitamin e effectively. However, taking vitamin e orally is important for the good health of other areas of the body.       The recommended skin lotions and creams by many experts are those th

(From what I've heard) What does hating pink have to do with anything though? Hmmm... I'd say the best way for you to try to be punk is to just... Let yourself lose. Don't confine yourself into thinking you have to just like this, or hate that. Punk shouldn't be about fences, it's about freedom. If you listen to a pop song and like it, don't deny it. If there is a really cute pink dress in the mall that looks great on you, buy it! Have opinions on things. Strong ones. But know what you're talking about! It's great to be anti-war, but know at least what the war is about.  If you just want punk style, it sounds like you're a little too polished. Throw in a little more grunge- some battered old jeans (vintage, like, for real battered), more color, maybe some classic punk band shirts and a patched up old black leather coat. Lose the eyeliner now and then, and wear your hair like you just woke up. Have fun with it! Don't just try to conform to 'punk'. That makes you a poser. ^.- And stay AWAY from Hot Topic.

YvuCN6qWaa	there are a lot of options but you should test these out on the weekends to see how it goes -    1. you can braid your hair and sleep with the braids on and in the morning you'll have waves. remember, the bigger the braid the bigger the way, and vice versa.    2. when you get out of the shower, dry your hair until it's damp, after that add some mousse or hairspray. separate your hair into two halves, top and bottom half. twist your hair until it makes a bun and tie it. you can add more hairspray if you want, and sleep with them on.    3. curling iron - just straighten your hair first and then curl your hair at the ends so it's a bit wavy, not too much.    4. flat iron - you CAN actually curl your hair with a flat iron, while you straighten it, twist your straightener inward and pull down, it'll come out as a curl but you can make it wavy by juts running your fingers through or something      * if your hair ever gets too poofy, i suggest just tying your hair into a low ponytail for an hour or so and take it out and it'll be less poofy.      good luck :)|`|dJfBJ7K7aa	mkay if you have split ends you may want to trim them, it will help get rid of the poof...secondly, get some shampoo to get rid of that dry hair...that contributes to most of the poof too...next, make sure you use conditioner and leave-in conditioner, that makes your hair managable and shiny, and oh so soft.....then, either put a relaxer or a conditioner in your hair and braid it, not a REALLY tight braid, but just tight enough...then the next day, take it out, and dont brush it unless you really need to...that should help....|`|5qIOzchwaa	A. The girl in the first pic didn't have naturally wavy hair, she had professionally curled hair with an iron.  B. the second pic didn't work  Anywho try sea salt water solution I hear it works wonders. when you braid your hair and take it out you're supposed to barely run your fingers through it so it won't get puffy but separates the sections. do not comb or brush after wards. Before you braid try using a spray on leave in conditioner or an anti frizz serum. The naturally dry hair isn't helping, get an olive oil hair mask or put straight olive oil on it once a week with a cap on for at least 30 mins. that'll help your situation out a lot.|`|FVoajU8Paa	okay do sunsilk anti-poof shampoo and conditioner then try doing a twist bun after taking a shower and sleep with it. make sure you make the bun really big so you get the wide curls. then when you wake up use a gel while its still wet and scrunch it up with your hands.|`|hVZkMkqVaa	hot rollers, then brush them out with your fingers, or just sponge rollers. go here for a how-to: http://www.wonderhowto.com/how-to/video/...    mine? http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|Bj7Tah5Paa	french braid it while it is wet then sleep with it like that|`|0405893528ec8866808fd4b76dad4bd1aa	yes. i get beach waves with my hair all the time.  just buy a triple barrel curler like this:  http://www.presentsforyou.com/sb3csconai...    or a spiral curler like this:  http://www.folica.com/Solia_Professio_d3...      they work very well for me.

(not saying you should wear stuff that belongs in the circus..)    just tell him how you feel. ask him what's wrong  something probably happened in his family or with his guy friends, because he's normally sweet and nice|`|ox7mJ2Psaa	as a rule guys are as different individually as girls are but guys are a lot more simple and direct about getting what they want. guys and girls both pick hot looking people when they are young and not very bright. experience hopefully will change their preference to average looking people with a good head ( smarts and common sense not cuteness ) on their shoulders. put your focus on building know how to get things done not on what hair dye to use, out fit to wear, or what girl gift to give on all those stupid meaningless one day events girls worry about. young guys are pretty simple they either want food, entertainment or sex.  older guys like to create stuff so they forget to eat and work on and on building stuff. they still like food, entertainment and sex but it isn't as important to them as it is for younger guys. remember guys are not girls - girls love scented candles, flowers, cards, teddy bears, balloons, and other gift crap on holidays. just cook for a guy and give him a good f...ing a couple of times a week and he is happy. understand? don't subject him to endless girl talking about and cute girl stuff. hes a man = he builds stuff, he destroys stuff, he f...s you when you let him, he sleeps, eats and poops. end of story.
cTAM7piBaa	dont worry about it braces arent THAT bad.yes it totally possible to look good after about 2 weeks people will get use to you having them on.and think of it this way once to get them off your teeth will be soo pretty and teeth are the one thing a guy notices!|`|coxEsXNTaa	call me crazy but when i had braces i LOVED them:) i dont know why but i did! i think i looked cute in them so im sure you will too.|`|qpWStE5Saa	clear is usually the hottest. srry to break it to u, but as long as ur teeth are white, u got a good bod, and good face, ur ok... answer mine?im sure u can find it, don hav link...|`|xETCO0rUaa	Just get the clear ones and embrace the fact that you have them. im a sevie and i have braces and a retainer but i still have a boyfriend, Yipee. my brother has braces too and he's a sophmore, hehe i think i spelled sophmore wrong whatev:):)|`|buU2w7dTaa	i've met guys who actually PREFER braces!|`|31hJnQBHaa	its aright, just pick clear. i think u could try to look cute in them.|`|AA10074793	sure. just get clear. thats what i would get just dont get any colors.|`|zuyvWVkdaa	im a dude and i think there cute|`|k1FenuRLaa	yes girls can look cute in braces, but its harder for a guy to pull it off.|`|QsQj8jO7aa	2 different opinions:    I love girls with braces. Yes they look very good.     If you're a guy, yuck braces are hideous.|`|LSKeLOIGaa	I had braces from age 13-16 and Im 20 now and I felt the same way you did. But when they started straightening my teeth out I began to like them and on top of that I had $5000 in my mouth and I wish somebody wouldve tried to tease me lol... Anddd on top of that its a lot of people who wish they could get braces but cant bc of financial reasons. Braces arent that bad and yes you can look cute with them lucky me I was one of those people. It'll be worth it :)|`|yM3QtXgPaa	yeah. on some people it looks good.  i think i looked better with braces!  but i got them off and now i have a retainer.  but to answer ur question. yeah it can!|`|IbI487CYaa	To be honest braces only look good on a few lucky people. But it's not like they are going to make a pretty person be really ugly. The important thing is that you'll have gorgeous teeth when they come off. Besides, IMO, braces start looking cute on people when there are teeth are basically straight and they are almost about to get them off. Don't worry, it should not ruin your social life. You may get less attention from guys but you'll still be considered attractive.|`|c3uFKxH5aa	braces are a pain sometimes, but you will get used to them and at the end it will all be worth it.|`|mnXxJtqmaa	yeah sure i know a bunch of guys that like girls with braces and some of the guys i like have them. no biggie.|`|53NFQqKwaa	That sucks :[  When I had braces, I had clear ones that are ceramic. They cost a bit more but you can barely notice them so it's well worth it.
mGCgzg13aa	Your hair actually looks really nice the way it is. But if you want to dye it go with the first picture. Or maybe you can try a lighter brown with red undertones like this colour  http://www.eleablake.com/photos/3-468.jp...|`|0405893528ec8866808fd4b76dad4bd1aa	i think you could really pull that off.  try the miley cyrus picture [the hair]  that would be a good color on you,  with some thick and thin highlights of the second picture.    aww you'd look really good with that color!  way better then you do now!  no offense!  i think your really pretty!  but please post another question once you get your hair colored,  because i want to see how it will look!  i will add you!    -abby|`|LOgGGuRqaa	i think you shouldnt dye your hair...its really pretty like that in ur first pic|`|dqy7DdoSaa	I think the black suits you but this is coming from a guy what do I know about fashion etc.    If you really wanted to change it I think brown would look better than blonde but whats wrong with black?|`|VEglNTgoaa	the miley cyrus one. i love your hair by the way :)|`|l5wziiicaa	You look great with dark hair and I don't think you should go blond, maybe just a light brown or something light ash brown.|`|iZf62jacaa	well i dont know how do git the link up lol.. but i think you should go a little lighter. like the first picture:)|`|aS81Ckdcaa	You could definately pull it off. You look good with dark hair too. Also i think it should be in between the first and second pictures.|`|4zvwKkuaaa	I think you would look fine with lighter hair. I'd just say dont get really light blonde hair. Maybe you can dye your hair light brown-medium brown?|`|YFhIDBp6aa	the miley ones perfect on you its a little lighter then your hair but its not to much beutiful i luv it    hope i helped|`|ANYUmEU8aa	i think that you should go with the miley cyrus color. i think that the dark hair really drowns you out. some lighter hair would definately make you look better. a spash of make up never hurts. but i definately wouldnt go with the blonde if i were you|`|DXGzgyu1aa	alrighty.. yeah its kinda hard to see your eyebrow color.. butta id say yeah go for it. mix it up. i would go for the second pic, with like highlights/lowlights/ streaks the color ofmileys hair.
4zvwKkuaaa	I think that to just get rid of hair shouldn't be worth spending that much. I guess you can wax or something?|`|0405893528ec8866808fd4b76dad4bd1aa	yes i used it,  but it didnt work well for me.  i got a chemical burn and had to go to the doctor to get my legs wrapped up in a cream gauze.  it hurt so bad.  i recomend you dont use it.  just stick to good old shaving,  or get lazer done frofessionaly..    -abby|`|1ZdLeh0Zaa	not at all  im sorry      i want one though
baCQZM0iaa	what i love about gray is that it goes with almost any color! (except for brown, that looks weird, and black or white just looks boring)    but i personally love how gray looks with orange!   I mean, its colorful but the gray brings it down a little.     I also like how green looks with gray. same as above, except green is a safer choice than orange if you dont like taking risks|`|sg0m6LBRaa	hmm burgundy looks beautiful  as does a nice rich purple    maybe a pink?  navy blue to keep it boyish. :)|`|hLdIO43Xaa	Any colors work since grey is neutral! It's like asking what does with white. Most colors do!   Especially especially jewel tones like ruby, emerald, sapphire.  Also, eggplant is nice.

Although, if it was him that originally liked you, you would think he would be texting you...I am wondering does this friend that is signing his praises about how he has changed perhaps like him too? I've never known any of my friends to compliment a guy unless it turned out they had a thing for them. Now going on this experience if say your friend does like him, might she have went to him and said that you told her you thought he was a player? Just a thought.

ALOT. use as much as possible and keep on scrunching every few times u spray. keep doing this for a little while as u realize that ur hair is getting wavy cuz ur handwarmth has been drying it so the wetness isnt pulling it down anymore. keep scrunching now and then.     then put ur hair up in a MESSY bun on the very top of ur head and clip. do not use a hair tie. spray non-fastened underside hair, meaning the part of ur hair that isnt in with the bun that probly looks straight with volumizing spray and put in a little Big sexy hair thickening spray which also acts as a hair spray.    keep scrunching loose pieces and anything u can get ur hands on....    then sleep while its damp. make sure ur pillow is a silk one not cotton or there goes all u r hard work!    in the morning, take out ur clip and let ur hair fall down. now it is volumized amazingly but not tooo poofy at the top and amazingly wavy beach waves. if u want it to look a little less "slept in", massage fructis shine sculpting wax thru it, not too much tho, to define waves and/or put some shine spray all over and work thru with hands. do not brush ur hair. if u want, spritz ur hair a little with some light hold hairspray or a little more of that wave spray. ur hair will look AMAZING    trust me. i get compliments all the time|`|YuPNVX9maa	1.

So this is going to take gel and hairspray.  Wet your hair, but it can't be dripping wet, brush it all out.  Squeeze some gel in your hands turn your head upside down and start crunching your hair toward your scalp.  Repeat until lightly crunched.  Then spray with hair spray and crunch just a couple more times.  Spray one last time for good measure.  Just so you know the longer your hair is there will be less of a wavy look...and the shorter the hair you will end up with more wave.

First brush your hair then when you get your hair wet while your in the shower start scrunching it, while shampoo & conditioning. When your out get any product Gel.

Hope this helped :)|`|yESGH991aa	After you take a shower, let your hair air dry. Comb your fingers through your hair, it doesnt hurt your head. Afterwards, try srunching it. If not, let it dry, and srunch your hair. Or you can put water on the ends of your hair ans srunch it as much as you want. Make sure to do this with ur head upside down, it creates volume and depth to the waves. Then just push down your head alittle and your good to go.

6npsRIzUaa	I'd point your mom in the direction of sites that explain how tongue piercings work, all the risks, etc. And maybe ask her to go with you to a local piercing parlor and have her discuss it with the piercer, if you mom is well informed on the piercing and still says no, then just wait it out until you're of legal age/moved out/she agrees to it.|`|9iXGakohaa	By showing her that you are a responsible mature adult and also by showing that this is something you really want... and isn't just something trendy. She may want to save you regret later and life and by explaining that this piercing is something you will always like, and that won't effect your future (i.e. it's hidden so jobs can't discriminate etc...) she may come to see your side, I know it worked for my parents! Good luck!|`|uv0Y7Ar8aa	Its your body ... Demonstrae a little responsibility. If you want the piercing pay for it professionally. Research it.

xETCO0rUaa	You have to stop telling yourself how ugly you are ( not saying you are i've never seen you) i had the same problem. What helped me the most was to wear more makeup and curl and straighten my hair. the more time you spend making yourself look better the more comfident you'll be. i had the same exact problem i thought i was really fat and ugly, think about other girls being jelous of your eyes and what they think of you when you walk by; think positively. good luck girly:):)|`|VqAgZB0uaa	look....everytime you feel like that just remember that there are definately peopl eout there who have it much worse. i bet you arent even 'ugly', but you just see yourself that way. i seriously think that you need to understand that if boys have liked you and you have nice friends, looking good on the outside will happen if you just feel good on the inside.     and once more, other people have it much worse....be thankful for what you have. just tell yourself that you are beautiful and act as if you are. other people will then belive it too! (belive me it'll work) just tell yourself you look amazing, kay? hope you feel better about yourself!    lots of girls have self esteem issues (including me) so if you start to feel better than thats GREAT! one less person who feels bad about themself! :) goood luckk|`|HI0oQriqaa	put your picture on here and ask . we will tell you . you know you are going to change too as you get older . those blue eyes got to look nice.|`|EacvGNgdaa	Story of my life as welll...

I just had to stop looking in mirrors for a while. Instead of thinking of how I looked to other people, I just focused on enjoying myself. After a few months I grew more comfortable with myself.|`|zSo7fvGKaa	i feel like that too :/  may be kinda mean  but i like looking at uglier people  and saying AT LEAST i dont look like that  it suckkss  but well grow up and one day like ourselves  and other people will be attracted to us :p    watchh well be the prettiest when everyone else is 60! :)|`|MbFS6XFQaa	CALM DOWN!     Seriously! You're just a kid! You're probably just at your "awkward stage". Everyone has one.    But if you seriously feel sick when you look in the mirroe, I think you need to talk to someone...|`|zub6aYxHaa	ok, first use skin id for your acne  it really works i used it and mine is all gone  second, go shopping, find some totally cute outfits and buy them  third, get a hair cut, even if you like yours, get a cute style and mix things up  fourth, go to someone (like your friends) and ask them how to do your makeup. then you might feel better  fifth, if it works, after all of this, stand in front of the mirror and make your self feel sexy  just pose and mess with your hair until you feel beautiful  i hope you find something that works. and you should put up a picture so i can help you more. if not im vdawg33  so comment one of my questions and ill help you  ttyl  |`|KvwVBzb0aa	I know it doesn't help now but I was really homely when I was 14! I was overweight, and poor so I dressed funny and wore coke bottle glasses and my Mom cut my hair! Iwas a mess!. Better days are coming! What I did to get through was I found a picture of what I wanted to look  like when I was 18 and taped it to my wall, I chose a picture of a woman that had some of the same facial features and who I thought was beautiful. I would look at it every morning and say that is what I will look like soon. I started to grow and style my hair the same and found inexpensive ways to dress the way I wanted and mostly I worked on being the most friendly person in the world. I had a million friends and I started to get the guys because I took the time to develop a personality. By 15 I was one of the most popular kids in my school and though looks weren't as important to me I still looked at my picture on the wall every day and by 16 I was better looking than the picture. I attribute it to a positive attitude and that might sound corney but it works. Now that I am older I am thankful I was an ugly duckling because I don't think I would have developed such a strong personality and learned patience if I would have been drop dead to begin with! I'll bet though you are only ugly in your mind and you really shouldn't be so hard on yourself it's not good for your mind development, and is one of the main reasons teenagers suffer depression. You have friends and already had a couple guys tht liked you, look around there are probably quite a few that don't have what you have!|`|XeKNqSQSaa	Wow you stole my life story......Wish i knew the answer!|`|mnXxJtqmaa	I bet ur not ugly  anyways, try proactive for the acne or go to target they have a whole asile full of scne treatments|`|xELGs0DJaa	try a new style change ur whole image but beatiful in the inside ok and dont let get words get down ok chica!!!|`|LaUouVtfaa	I know this doesn't help right now, and you'll probably overlook this, but you are going to grow into your looks. You're only fourteen, you have some time there, and your not gonna have acne in ten years. You will get better in time, everyone does.|`|uoe1VjDoaa	Smile. Were all different|`|nHD8nQTRaa	Give it some time. Some girls i went to high school with were nothing special then, and now they are gorgeous.|`|CZLpTU8iaa	It's all inside, be confident! I feel the same way! But then I realized my friends are prettier than me in some ways, but I'm prettier than them in some ways! You are who you are and you are only 14, you will get even prettier as you get older! YOU ARE NOT UGLY!!!! My friends all think I'm prettier than them but I think they are prettier than me! Almost all teenage girls have low self-esteem!|`|uEO8572gaa	I agree with the others, just try something out of the norm, may it be a hair style, make up, or clothing. In life I've realized if there are things you don't like and can't change, the only thing left to change is the way you think about things.|`|53NFQqKwaa	You like your blue eyes right?  I suggest playing them up with eyeliner and maybe some light eyeshadow.    Also, try doing different things with your hair. I don't mean like dyeing it or anything but maybe just straightening/curling it.    My friend also had serious esteem issues and she told me that every day when she woke up and got ready, she would look in the mirror and compliment herself on something. Her hair, her outfit, anything. And apparently, it worked :]|`|l6TzxyN1aa	your not the ugliest beleive me...i am
2oN7WrVKaa	It looks like a plastic bag...  >_>  Return it.|`|9zLhZHRCaa	its cuteeee!|`|256cVXsmaa	Ohhhhh nooo, not my style at all! BOW?!

I like it best in the black and light pink!|`|O24FewSQaa	I think it is pretty cute!!!!  for a sweet sixteen, you can be really funky with that!!!    cute   :)    but I think that you should maybe look at betsey johnson dot com  instead!|`|1sfYOZNbaa	sorry i dont really like it.. especially the bow|`|ro3X9fs3aa	yeah very very cute : )|`|IYvenrU7aa	uhm its a little too much for my liking|`|FvjbdPNPaa	kinda...its a little plain...it needs straps or something but i like the color|`|0CjorHQuaa	i think its rly cutee (:  i want it.|`|YpoKUoInaa	its cute..but it looks..."stiff"?|`|VVQYuMO1aa	take it back unless you have a really built up body u should sorry|`|rPB6VqfOaa	I think its cute! but if i were you, and youre going to a sweet 16, i would go for something like this: http://store.delias.com/item.do?itemID=5...    its a little bit more.... sophisticated  :)|`|bGcUdRkyaa	ahhh.......ya|`|kDyj5d7laa	i dont think it is too bad. if you are really worried about it, were an old homecoming dress or something. no one is going to care. you can go out and buy a new dress for everything.|`|nj8o4Rgzaa	ya its pretty u should definatly kep it its really cute|`|7lQfCrbcaa	I think it's cute! But it all depends on your body shape. Wear it and get an opinion from a friend! :)|`|9z0dzBjAaa	i like it!  the black one.|`|uFuAA2fxaa	it is alright but the hot pink is UGLY!!!|`|iZf62jacaa	well i love it!!     good choice have fun:)|`|PHh1IYSsaa	it's okay, but you know, if you don't like it, it doesn't matter anyway right? cause you won't be happy wearing it. so return it.    go buy a dress that you LOVE.|`|rrLd1ZSRaa	yea actually i really like it, its different and totally cute. dont take it back.|`|cgkHM2bsaa	I personally think it is a little bit too flared and not that form-fitting.I have seen many people wear it and it looks awkward because they don't have the right body for it.I would try the dress below because it still looks pretty sophisticated/classy AND is on sale! Have fun at your friends sweet sixteen!    http://store.delias.com/item.do?itemID=5...|`|7I4QFT6Taa	you should return it!!|`|VRZKHqbkaa	its adorable. go with the dark pink or the gray.|`|XWCiAxUBaa	I think it's veryyy cute!  I wouldn't wear it, lol, but that's just cause of my style, but I like it!  Nice choice!    : )|`|0HOGn7njaa	it is if you are really petite :)|`|3CTcs5u6aa	without the bow it would be nice.. other than that..return it!|`|6Rajgcjiaa	just return it. if your not sure if you like it other people will be the same wah|`|DvkOaeUdaa	I love the color!   Im not so great about the big bow and its so plain, That bow just POPS out at youu. I dont really like it , Maybe somthing more flowy and a color like that would look great(:  And some white dress shoes . Yepp , good luck .|`|6vZ2H7Uhaa	Personally I don't think it's very flattering (on anyone)  I would return it.|`|6Ps4MRFHaa	AWWWWW..i like it|`|hXvoMpgtaa	ITS ADORABLE|`|kfsWVrMlaa	Eh, it's okay, but definetly not my favorite. I feel like it's too prom-ish for a sweet 16 party. You probably don't want my adivce, and we probably don't have the same taste, but this is what I would pick to wear from Delias to the party:  http://store.delias.com/item.do?itemID=5...    You probably don't like it but, I'm bored! Haha! Have fun at the party!|`|dookiJfuaa	It would be better without the bow!|`|mGCgzg13aa	The dress is well ok...a bit plain on the colour it would only look good if you are thin...because this kind of dress tends to make people look "fatter" in it so it'll only work on more petite people. If you do end up looking for another dress go with something more fitting that clinches around your ab area or just above it because it will show your shape better and hide unflatteries. : )|`|WCYEHwEIaa	With anything you wear, how well you look in it depends on how well you feel you look in it, and how it flatters your figure. It's a cute dress, and good for the occasion. If you put it on, look in the mirror, and aren't in love with, go for something else! You are your worst critic. So, if you are pleased, everyone else is going to thing you look amazing!|`|89AN5yZwaa	I love it. Honestly, but if you lived in utah you'd get a lot of looks.  -I JUST WANNA RIP THE BOW OFF AND PUT IT IN MUH HAIR!!  XD|`|UnRYPQtmaa	i think this dress is cute but i would only wear it if i was the person having the party and turning 16  but it is adorable|`|DmgBlycRaa	its okay|`|ZU0K6XDcaa	Eh, its alright I mean its cute but I would pick another dress and use that one as a last resort.
XxgbNeb7aa	It makes hair smoother. just don't use too much.|`|UtYOwE4Laa	greasy look.|`|CdfqJyYCaa	succeeding in proving idiots do exist
svpcp8jLaa	I don't suggest it because the combination of lipstick and lip rings is really stupid. It creates an illusion called "SCENE", I'm not quite sure if you've heard of it. I'm not trying to insult you, I'm just trying to prevent you from committing social suicide.     But if you have to, I suggest you use a lipstick brush because it can apply color to lips in a finer detail. It takes a little bit longer, but you can avoid decorating your lip rings.     Lipstick looks corny with snake bites, great with monroes. I've had all of them before.|`|UW8Aoid0aa	haha i think its mission nearly impossible  unless you take them out I don't think you can apply it  my friend has snakebites and watching him put on chapstick is just ridiculous|`|WR9NuZFiaa	I'm not a girl but i reckon if you either A. take out the piercing and apply lip stick then put it back it that will be the best. but if that's not an option try to bend the ring to one side apply lipstick to the part u bend the ring to then bend the ring the other way and apply it there too. Also you could just wipe the lipstick off the ring if worst comes to worst.
OHfZFR31aa	No, it means they are looking for US size 8-10 (as opposed to UK size or European size).    When they specify a size like that, it's normally for fit models. They are looking for models of those sizes so designers can make sure the clothes they are designing will work on someone who is a size 8-10, as well as the size 2-4 the original sample size was made for.
Zp61sxNraa	The best way to get color is actually in the water, your skin absorbs the water and the sun reflects the water onto your skin (like those big mirror looking 1950s reflectors) I started tanning at like 15 and im 20 now and im already noticing slight wrinkles around my eyes and near my cheeks so please do be careful, It always depends on the UV index of the day (it usually says so on the weather for that day) The higher the UV index the less time it will take you to tan|`|gnPdm4V6aa	it depends on your skin. Any exposure to the sun unprotected can result in skin cancer. Since you are 13, why are you even worrying about it. If you start now, you will only look 40 by the time you are 30.   Getting breast tanned, does not give you breast cancer, its skin cancer. But that sounds like the dumbest thing I have heard to tan topless at 13.|`|cpcl3irAaa	i used to be obsessed with tanning and it was my dream to get a tan but i juss realized how much the sun can damage ur face and you can also get permanent damage from the sun and get wrinkels at an early age.    but i would take care of my skin and stick with sun lotion and be glad with the skin color u have. :)  make sure to moisturize ur skn everyday to not get wrinkles later      without a bikini top???    sry thats juss weird.

The best thing about fashion is mixing and matching and taken risks and creating your own style and then looking back of what you thought was so cute at one time in your life lol|`|kGSjSD61aa	Vintage, Minimal.

5wDjXzSraa	It's going to suck but a hot saline soak is about it.     You could try using a washcloth to do a saline compress, but I don't think that will be as effective at clearing the infection.|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	H2Ocean spray.

Take a sailine wash and put it on the source for a while, its should clear up but if not make sure that your washing it daily, not doing anything to irritate it and if it still presists, see your Derm and theyll give you a cream and itll clear right up.|`|paCHaDWVaa	Mine started getting infected and I kept it cleaned with Bactine and it cleared right up.|`|yCHsciGEaa	I have a stud they told me to use Bactine.  to clean it 3 times a day.

Beta carotene ( a form of Vit A)- from carrot oil - is really, really good for the skin and absorbs through three times more skin tissue than Vitamin E. It can heal scars, dryness and help with wrinkles underneath the skin so healthier skin emerges.|`|v8FlpPbGaa	i got Yes To Carrots C Me Smile lip butter in berry flavor and it's nice.there are different flavors.  i think it's called Yes To Carrots because all their products contain anti-oxidant Beta-carotene which is found mainly in carrots.i'm not sure though. but they're all organic products so that's good.

Ck9BRWnxaa	well,  i aint a woman yet,  but i am a teenager +im never seen without makeup,  and the answer to your question,  it makes us feel more confident because it can make us look our best and just feel great about ourselves knowing that we look nice,  its a nice feeling:D!|`|441GSyaMaa	For girls it hides certain things, like skin blotches, spots and whatever else (and lets be honest, When you see a girl made up (well)... she looks much better than she would without the make up on (even if it is just a little)) so girls just feel good with it.... (a lot say they feel naked without...)     Guys on the other hand, well it's like wearing tights, girls do because that's what they do, guys... different kettle of fish.|`|673e1801dcbf44f2f32732159d3c6799aa	well, for me, it makes me look more menacing. lol. i wear it to make my eyes stand out, make myself look better so i feel better.|`|KH9HROrSaa	it helps coverup my flaws(uneven skin tone) and bring out my best features.  there isn't anything wrong with makeup, its kind of like art to me.|`|Zfb0s7OWaa	IT MAKES MY EYES STAND OUT. SO IM TOLD.|`|oOZyl5BNaa	Wearing make up highlights a woman's facial features. When some women feel ugly they try to hide themselves, but when they have the time to get ready and put on makeup they want to show it off and be the center of attention (sometimes) causing a more confident woman. =]|`|y5i8GIFWaa	it helps people see there inner beauty  to attract the opposite sex  to bring out the beautiful features  to cover up spots  to even the skin tone  to compliment the eyes and hair..............etc|`|AWc52vOMaa	It makes the flaws look less noticable which in turn makes them more confident and maybe have better self esteem because they feel good :)|`|XbZIicftaa	It's not really the make-up itself, it's looking put together, like you didn't just roll out of bed.  I think taking time to prep for the day makes people feel confident, not just women.   Personally make-up doesn't do much for me I hardly ever wear it, but if my hair looks good then I feel more confident.  I hate when my hair looks like crap!|`|xJ9f7ekKaa	it covers up Gods mistakes(jk) lol no one is perfect but it just makes us that much closer haha and yeah guys usually dont like makeup|`|dhEvs07waa	depends on the person i guess.    covers up flaws, makes other flaws less obvious lol, makes our best features stand out|`|d299f1977edc0e3454fa0aec50ef4b49aa	it makes them look better.  looking better = feeling better = more confidence.|`|Cqg18qdAaa	because, we are expected to have perfect skin, it covers out flaws...though some dont know how to apply it, so it brings their flaws out, they should really research it....|`|4ceE9TFcaa	you're a man - you've been raised differently.  and you don't have that pressure on you to look perfect. just look into vogue, vanity fair, etc - they all promote a certain picture of how a woman should look like.  but actually, no woman looks like that without make up.    for most women, make up is a little helper - it helps to even out little flaws in your skin. so you look more perfect, and thus more like that model.  and being what everybody "wants" you to be, you feel good.|`|kkeHDr4Xaa	well 4 me make up BRINGS OUT the real me, it doesn't cover me. and its just so amazing what a little concealer and lipgloss can do. makeup offers INSTANT gratifacation and when used properly it makes you feel what perfection might feel like :) lol but I am only 14... but thats my view...|`|c5LNo5Mxaa	it lets women cover up their flaws and make them look like something they are not. (not why i use it to feel confident)  i use it to feel confident by applying little bit of it, natural looking, just to play up my already nice features and bring out my eyes and high cheekbones.|`|D7QdvWYDaa	Speaking as a guy who has never wore make-up. I have been told that women wear it to fell better about themselves, improve their confidence levels.    They eyes can "pop" or when they get the "smoky look" with the right amount of eye shadow it's an amazing transformation. It's also like when they buy a new outfit, skirt, top, shoes, handbag, and bangles, with the right amount of make-up it highlights the outfit they are wearing at the time.     Plus they can change colors of their make-up for different looks, during the day, mid day and evening. Make a sincere compliment on a women's make-up and they will thank you for it, and love the idea you noticed it, where some men don't.|`|m5FuM6XGaa	well, make-up makes girls feel more beautiful ( :  it covers up blemishes, makes eyes look bigger, it just makes such a difference : )
NIiWicdsaa	pfft just bring her n a few mates around to ur place and joke around and mess with a buzzer and tell her to shave it off and she will go aWAL on ur hairs *** hahaha|`|GwZkKAlVaa	well i think shaggy hair is extremely sexy and you shouldnt shave it. but if you like the girl just like talk to her, ask her out or something.. you never know what will happen ;)|`|Y4HKumx9aa	That sounds like such a masochistic fetish but so cute at the same time hahaha
f25136f77bb8e33b645c3b0896a24e5baa	Here are some good alternatives:    1) Tea tree oil--I get this special bar of tea tree oil soap at the Dollar General for $1. It's definitely worth 10x its price, because it really tames my acne    2) Triclosan--An antibacterial ingredient. Can be found in some face washes.    3) Sea breeze toner--It contains clove, which is an anti-bacterial agent.    Remember that you still need to exfoliate. Most facial scrubs contain salicylic acid, but St. Ives facial scrub doesn't have it (just make sure not to get the medicated version, because it does have S.A.).|`|uv0Y7Ar8aa	Use baking soda and water. Make a paste out of it and apply it. Will dry skin so I advise using a good mostiurizer immediately after. Tea tree oil is very good as well. It is a natural antibiotic and will reduce acne.|`|PcVwxJYwaa	Your best bet is most definitely a dermatologist, granted you should try the "do it yourself" remedies, 'cos if it works then you save a couple bucks, but a dermatologist is the way to go. I don't know about you, but I had pretty persistent super acne and now my face is almost entirely clear after a visit from a dermatologist and a couple months.|`|tdJXhhgxaa	Lemon and cucumber juice mixed together works for me when I cant afford the more expensive stuff. You can also try Dr. Bonners tea trea soap, you can get it at GNC, KROGERS, or PUBLIX. That also works really well.|`|GyKkb3ezaa	You should try home remedys that treat acne.

Hope this helps!|`|ZvLmuCiOaa	dermatologist!  go to one!
S61oU0yFaa	I had the same problem with a pair of boots I just bought... The problem could be that the spray was not of quality.  However, it's best to use a suede brush to rough up the surface before spraying them in order for the chemicals to get beyond the surface of the shoe.  If this doesn't work, go to a local shoe store or a shoe cobbler if you know of one and ask for their help.  It's their job.  Check out this website too... it gives you detailed information for every kind of stain you might encounter.    http://www.leatherworldtech.com/SuedeNub...
F8LP7I4Maa	Ok, I'm going to tell you that I've spent years researching this.  I'm Asian and I have short, stubby, thin eyelashes that are in desperate need of length.  (My boyfriend's are longer than mine - nice.)  I've paid upwards of $150 for tubes of various products that claim to lengthen eyelashes.  The results were minimal and the product only worked with continued use - talk about expensive!  My last resort was to try Blinc's Kiss Me Mascara and I'm in love.  It lengthens my lashes without making them look like spider legs (i.e. Revlon) and washes off easily with warm water and a cotton ball.  You can buy Blinc online at sephora.com for $24 (and you get three free samples) - I'm not sure chemical-wise what is in Blinc but I love it and think you will too!|`|CPZe3g74aa	no, and your eyelashes fall out anyways|`|242r14JXaa	i dont know of any speicif brand but alot of my fiends use vasiline with aloe vera belive it or not it seems to be working :)

jeX5VZAtaa	No I don't think so. It all depends where you carry extra weight. I know exactly what you are talking about. I am 5'1 125 lbs and I love how my collar bones show. I think it's sexy. Try push ups that may tone you up and make your shoulder bones more noticeable.|`|cypZ0ykXaa	it depends on the whole structure.coz few with underweight dont show shoulder  bones.and few with much weight has it.|`|yfZ5YSp4aa	At 139lb i reckon that is the max ideal weight for your height. Da minimum ideal weight would be 125lbs and if you really want to achieve that you should work out and eat healthy. NEVER EVER TRY AND STARVE YOURSELF.    I do that and it's a living hell not being able to eat what you want (i'm 112lbs and 5'8')|`|BKOgIfwHaa	I don't think you are overweight at all and be glad you have a little flesh on your shoulders. I am a small build weigh about 130 and am 5'8" and my shoulder bones always show and I always wish that they didn't show as much as they do. I think its a preference thing with us as to how we see ourselves and what looks are appealing to us .....to skinny is not in a little flesh is the new look.
4vqzkIr4aa	A brief explanation of how this works is that each artist working in the shop can charge what ever they want as long as the shop itself (or the owner) gets the amount agreed upon between the artist and owner. Say an artist works in a shop. He agreed with the owner that no matter what he may charge the shop itself gets 60.00 an hour or a percentage of a piece done and the artist keeps 100% of all tips. In most cases it is an hourly base that the shop gets. So the artist working can charge you as much as he wants as long as the shop itself gets the amount required.    Shop minimum is just a minimum charge so that the shop can stay in business when doing small flash pieces that take less than an hour.    I also find it odd that the artist actually expressed to you how much he charges an hour. Most of the time or a general rule of thumb is that the artist keeps this information to himself. He looks at the piece you want done and figures how long it will take then does the math in his head and gives you a final amount. And quite often if you are getting a piece done that the artist actually likes and enjoys doing you get more than what you pay for.|`|jI2j3wd8aa	shop around u might get a better deal|`|TOoNHNv9aa	usually shop minimum prices are between $20-$40. usually no more for a minimum. i got a small tattoo in december 08' of a heart, about a little bigger than a quarter it was only $40.  all shops have different prices and some shops don't even do the "minimum" thing.  they just charge by the hour and how much ink.  just make sure everything they use is new and make sure you trust the guy.|`|EcdelIHtaa	i have 3 tattoos and 1 is bigger tgan a CD but i havent been charge per hour  the tattoo shops ive been to charge me by how big the tattoo is..  and they all usually have the same price because only half of the profit goes to them..|`|bxlYleZkaa	You should be paying for the design, not how long it takes to do. If it it something the artist hasn't seen before then they should give you a price to do it. Not based on an hourly rate but for the whole thing completed.|`|yUXOOlAiaa	It's going to cost you an awful lot more than a 300 bucks to get it removed in a few years time.|`|8ab6993234808864c73a8260c98e510aaa	well.. a "shop" minimum would seem to imply that all artists within the shop charge the same minimum price... other shops might have different minimums...    just check out sample photos of work done by each artist...|`|AA11603810	They mostly have their own prices.. but they also charge based on the size of the piece.|`|YIplumj8aa	Shop minimum means just that - all the artists in that shop have to charge at LEAST that price for any tattoo.  So if their minimum is $100, even the smallest tattoo would cost that much no matter what.  And $100 per hour is a great deal - that seems about average for a good tattoo artist.  I think that may be the best price for the quality.  If you get quoted anything less than that, I wouldn't go for it - if an artist is willing to do something that size for less than $300, I wouldn't trust his skill.    Good luck.
02evYbbnaa	Basically, it's a website where you can make your own outfits by 'clipping' pictures from about any website once you join (for free!).

In Polyvore you can also add contacts, comment other people's outfits, join groups, send messages, and a lot more!! You'd get the hang of it (and it's very easy) once you go to the website.

FEhmNTL2aa	yes other light colors will do it too|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Anything white will glow.  If you wear a white bra or underwear under a thin cotton top or dress it will glow through that even.  Florescent colors will glow as well.  We used to have highlighter parties in college.  You'd show up wearing a white T or tank top and there'd be highlighters in all colors that you'd use to draw on other people's shirts and skin.  All the light bulbs in the room were changed out for black light bulbs.  Its pretty amusing to see someone walking around with a yellow highlighter mustache.|`|QmpobMj7aa	Yea, ever been to a laser tag?  Any white seems to glow under a black light.

0G1fOjpWaa	It sounds like you have very unusual and beautiful colouring. The spots you can beat. Make sure you have a healthy diet, drink plenty of water, get excersise, dont smoke and don't drink too much alcohol. Gently cleanse your skin twice a day using rose water or cucumber water on a cotton wool pad.    If your spots dont clear up, go to your doctor and make sure your hormones are working as they should be or your doctor might put you on antibiotics or retinol cream.     As for your freckles making you look dirty, don't be silly, freckles add interest and accent to a face, just like marilyn monroe's mole, minnie drivers jaw line, brooke shields eyebrows or liz taylors violet eyes. Some people want freckles so badly that they draw them on with eye pencils!!lol. I have freckles and once this guy told me that my generous sprinkling of "cute spots on my nose and cheeks" was so beautiful that he couldn't stop looking at them......Freckles are the best!:)|`|pGOv3sFfaa	You can't get rid of your freckles.. embrace your beauty and what you have! I bet you look fine! It's all in your self-conscience!|`|3Q9HcfQsaa	put some makeup on|`|875db9dbe2ce224475dab7f10775abccaa	try vanishing cream|`|zWBYxMvWaa	Getting rid of freckles is impossible, they are wired in your DNA.    The lemon treatments are only for scarring and bleaching skin, so you only enhanced your freckles.    Be happy with what you look like! Everyone is always self concious with themselves when most of the time, nobody cares.  Embrace yourself, everyone has their faults. I'm sure if you asked everyone in the world, most would change at least on thing about themselves.      If people bring it up then just laugh it off and ignore it! As long as you are happy with what you look like then everyone will stop bugging you.  If you are constantly embarrassed by something that you can't change, then people will ALWAYS pick on you.
GyKkb3ezaa	First that happens after you begin shaving for awhile. The more we shave the thicker the hair grows back, and as the hair grows thicker we have to shave more frequently. Their is no way to avoid it growing thicker because it's a natural process of the human body, but if you wax your legs the hair won't grow for 3-4 months because you are ripping the hair follicles completely out instead of when you shave shaving off the top layer.     To avoid the black marks when you finish shaving apply lotion to moisturize and you can also consider Nair. I is less harsh and doesn't require a razor which means no cuts and bumps.
IStGqIWBaa	I agree. Didn't your mother teach you ''If you can't say anything nice don't say it at all.'' To all the people with the mean comment. If people choose to post pics of them self so be it. Who cares?|`|u7o75zipaa	Why are people so insecure and stupid that they listen to what strangers over the internet say?    Seriously, there's nothing for anyone to be jealous about. First off, we don't even know if the people in the pictures are the people asking the questions. Secondly, the people posting them are either vain and seeking compliments.. which is pretty pathetic, or else they're insecure and have low self-esteem.    What do people expect when they're asking a whole bunch of strangers to rate them?|`|ncPdftafaa	why do you care?  it's Y!a..  i'm a ***** because you're a sensitive little prick who needs to go to bed, how 'bout them apples?    plus, it's fun making you cry. now go make puddles about how people call you ugly all day..dont' get the keyboard wet. i'm looking forward to your reply back.|`|jPIyZRTqaa	I think people are meaner over the internet because there are not the same consequences as there would be in a face-to-face interaction.  For example, if someone asked how they looked in person, you probably wouldn't tell them they looked awful because they might punch you.|`|sPQBluKEaa	i personally don't make a lot of comments on people's pictures, but i think a lot of people are mean about it because it seems kind of desperate for people to put pictures up on yahoo answers and ask for people who don't even know them to give them advice or judge them. one of the things that comes with putting up a picture and asking for opinions is the mean stuff that some people say.    but i also think that if they are going to be mean and say stupid things that they shouldn't bother answering the question.|`|0HXclnCXaa	hey if the person is ugly then we're definately gonna let them know. people on yahoo are brutal. && people who post their pics on here know that. if they can't take it then that's their problem|`|KvwVBzb0aa	It's just like the commercial says you should never say anything about someone else on line that you wouldn't say in person!

Go to events that require you to get dressy, like parties, public events, etc. SInce you're at a university, there should be a number of social and entertainment and cultural events you can dress up for - many are free, if cost is an issue.  2. You're in university - start using the LANGUAGE, not this silly computer style which is a TRUE SIGN OF LAZINESS.

Shoot, in winter, it's too frickin' cold to try to look all cute and stuff. When I see young girls with tiny skirts and it's minus twelve degrees, I think that is stupid. My spring and summer wardobe always looks best, because I think those two seasons have cuter clothes as well. You can be clean and decent though. If I don't have to go anywhere, I may not groom myself unless I REALLY have somewhere to go. I just like chillin'. Maybe I'm just a wannabe hermit...LOL. There's nothing wrong with just trying to be warm and not overly glam when it's wintertime. Keep warm and thaw out in the spring.|`|FwdBKodSaa	One of the things that I hate winter for is the clothes.

e248fbf4bda3b339c8800122c1551870aa	Most of the lotion evaporates. It does NOT go into your blood. Lotion will not penetrate the cell membranes of the skin. It will only keep the dead skin cells from appearing dry.  You're basically conditioning your skin.    The residue that does not evaporate is not likely to get past the surface of your skin.    Your skin has layers upon layers of dead cells and the lotions you use will not penetrate all the layers of your skin. It usually gets washed off unless you don't wash your body regularly.    There are corrosive chemicals that will break down your skin and get into your blood stream if you get them on your skin. But the ingredients in hand lotion or suntan lotion is not one of them. And if you did get one of those chemicals on you, you would have large blisters forming on your skin long before it ever got deep enough to get into your blood    There is also a chemical called DMSO that allows you to absorb medications into your blood stream through your skin. DMSO will penetrate your skin without disrupting the cell membranes.|`|6Ss31wyBaa	Your skin absorbs it. You will notice if you are applying lotion, the less dry your skin is the longer the lotion will stay wet on the skin. Things that are made for the skin like antibiotic ointment and lotion are okay to be soaked into the skin, it what they are made to do.  If you put antibacterials on a cut the tissues absorb the ointment and use it to help your white blood cells fight off germs. It doesn't go into your bloodstream just the tissues under the skin.  The same applys for lotions and even antiwrinkle creams and makeup (mineral makeup is good, it doesn't get absorbed).  This is also why it is so important to buy products that are not going to clog your pores and are dermatologist approved. Because when the skin absorbs them most of the time (unless its a cut) it is absorb through the pores. And you pores can get clogged and cause acne and blackheads.  Oh and to get rid of lotions and such in your body, if your tissues feel like they have too much, they simply push it back out through your pores when you sweat, so it never gets anywhere else in your body.|`|Ld1vLH8Kaa	The liquid content will most likely evaporate into the air. The more solid stuff may sink eventually into the bloodstream via the pores in the skin.|`|kT7akcE6aa	I just wanted to clarify that tattoos are not "applied to the skin"    A tattoo is ink deposited under the skin top layers of skin, and then your skin heals over the top of it.  A tattoo is basically a coloured scar underneath your skin.    Not entirely sure about the rest of your question, though, sorry.

Maybe straighten it too a max of 3 times a week|`|0UYJkSuZaa	I used to get my hair chemically straightened at a salon and then it started getting too pricey so I started using the kits you get at drug stores. The kits didn't work as well as getting it done at the salon but it still worked. Everyone says that they are super damaging and that it will fry your hair, but hair color, straightening systems and perms have come a long way over the years. My hair never dried out, it never fell out, never looked fried, etc. In fact my hair was super soft after wards. If your hair is already damaged, then it make make it a little worse. Most people that leave the hairdressers with fried hair from whatever process they just got done had damaged unhealthy hair when they walked in and didn't notice til they got something done that they could blame it on.  If you want to get it done, then go ahead. It's not that expensive and since it washes out in 3 months it is defiantly less damaging.|`|0OHfojSpaa	One of my friends did this: thermal reconditioning.  It was because she was always straightening her hair and hated how wavy her hair was, despite me telling her it looked great.  It worked, and it was extremely straight, not even a hint of a wave.  Pros: lasted a long time, looked naturally straight, and she didn't have to straighten every day--even after washing.   Cons: expensive ($200), as her naturally wavy hair grew in it looked weird so she always had to get it straighten every 3 months. You should leave your hair as it is, this way it doesn't get too damaged.    I did a Google search for Easy Straight, and from the user comments, it sounds like a buyer beware type of deal.

Good luck!|`|OBuzcIDbaa	Just takes practice. The more you do it, the easier it'll get.|`|SYcYoxfMaa	It does take practice, but you'll get used to it.

c5LNo5Mxaa	brushes should generally be cleaned once a week. if you wash them too much the bristles will loosen up faster and make the bristles fall out and therefore the brushes won't last as long. you can use gentle soap and warm water but you can also purchase special brush cleaner formulas. Sephora and Sally Beauty Supply carry cleaners (but many other makeup brands will also carry cleaners). Sephora has spray and towel kind  and a special soap and SBS has it in liquid and towels and i bought a spray bottle and use it from there. they run from like $6-$20. With the towels you just clean them off using them and with the spray you spray it on and wipe them off with a towel. it's best to let them dry over night. don't ever leave them in a brush holder right side up because if the soap and water or cleaner gets to the base of the bristles they will loosen up. leave them laying flat to dry. just be gentle and careful and they'll last a long time.    I'll put all the websites with the info for you.  also i'll post a link to a tutorial video by julieg713 on youtube.com on how to clean brushes. i learned from her vid.|`|1zy9ckbzaa	Wash them daily. There can be bateria and germs that can be built up and led to breakouts.  I use a very mild bar of soap. (Dove)|`|AtJgXB59aa	i wash my brushes everyday|`|uWQIsjAVaa	I don't think washing them dialy is absolutely necessary, but you should clean them pretty often. Baby shampoo is really good for brushes because it handles them very well.    Also, wash it with hot water to get out any excess bacteria in the brush.    Ha and make sure not to use a blow dryer to dry them, I tried that and it burnt my brush. I know, kind of stupid.|`|2SSGpCsOaa	I don't think you have to wash them everyday, unless you use a really dark color on a brush and you want to wash it before you use it in a lighter color.     You can use baby shampoo, but I like mac brush cleaner. It works really well and conditions your brushes too.|`|kkeHDr4Xaa	1st make sure you brushes are soft. you CAN NOT correctly apply make up if you have stiff brushes.    also its good you clean ur brushes b/c a dirty brush can cause break outs    as for the cleaning: soak ur brushes in a mixture of hot water and antibacterial soap (such as kiss my face or Dr. Bronner's lavender soap) for 10-15 mins. leave then out to air dry and between cleanings, wipe off ur brushes with tissues.    P.S. if the bristles stray off after frequent use just cut them back but make sure to know wen you have to go get new brushes. even though they should last you a LONG while.
Yd3SjLGAaa	Violet, Plum, Lavender shades - anything in the purple family. Think of the color wheel, and purple is opposite of green, so purple will make green pop out more. Even something in a silver tone would look really pretty on you! I would actually stay away from green tones - its that analogy of displaying emeralds on a green cloth - they don't stand out as much when a similar color is used to showcase them. Also - blue tones are going to make the browns stand out, so avoid those if you don't want them to look as brown!|`|2diobki7aa	A dark brown or black mascara would really help!  Then go for some eye liner. I'd suggest brown or black again, but be sure to match the eye liner and mascara.  Finally, some subtle eyeshadow. Maybe just a neutral skin color, with a bit of shimmer to it. That's what I use, and it makes my eyes stand out a lot more than no eyeshadow.  (: I hope this helps!|`|c75136fa3cfb0f896f32ff0cd1d36ffcaa	try doing a subtle green eye shadow. obviously you dont wanna do too much or it will look kinda weerd haha.. i would mix green with another neutral color    or wear a really green shirt:)|`|MFYiwCVYaa	well, try wearing more green. Not lime green or plain green just try wearing a darker green itl bring out the color in ur eyes. Or you could even try a light blue.

cdf9bde60acfd0a622e4bbdccdc9e515aa	Sometimes if our lips are chapped, we bite them and tear the dry pieces off with our teeth. I've done this before, and tearing the skin off made my lip swell up. I try to keep them moisturized so I don't absent-mindedly nibble on my lips.    With that in mind, you might want to make sure you're not having an allergic reaction to something you ate or came in contact with. If you think this might be the case, take some Benedryl. If it persists and you're worried, see a doctor. Good luck.|`|J5osM2O8aa	Get some lip balm, if you're not really sure what that is ask your mum or any girls that you know.  If that doesn't fix and and it doesn't get better go see a doctor.    The lip balm is pretty much invisible and plenty of guys use it, including me from time to time. It's just moisturizes your lips.|`|BTyE1Ou4aa	if its like a skab try drinking a bit more water, it will be fine, it usually gets worse than it can get better, you know whats good for it, juiced cucumber just put on your lips, thats my answer for everything, its really great at healing!!!
ih1ruMENaa	I'd recommend using a liquid foundation with buildable coverage. Since you don't have any blemishes, it's likely you have a dry-to-normal skin type, so powder foundations (which are heavier and cling to dry spots) would be unadvisable.    Ideally, I'd recommend Giorgio Armani Luminous Silk Foundation. It won the Best of Beauty award for Allure, InStyle and Cosmo magazines.

xNkmK0SHaa	If hair is not real long (less than 2 inches below ear lobes), try this:  When hair is damp, but not dripping wet, apply the mousse.  Run your fingers thru the hair from scalp to end while using dryer on warm in other hand.  It will take practice, but when you have mastered it you will seem to have thicker, full bodied hair.    Newborn babies have more and thicker hair than I do.

4vbovQKJaa	I have 2 tongue piercings, and I've had them for 12 years.  The main thing you want to do is keep it clean - you do NOT want an infected tongue.  I've heard different things from different tattoo/ piercing parlors, but here's what I've done.  After eating or drinking anything, brush your teeth and rinse with Listerine.  Clean your ring itself frequently - if it's gonna be in your body permanently, make sure it's sanitary.      And I won't lie, getting it pierced does hurt like hell.  My chin and jaw hurt from forcing my tongue out to be pierced, and of course my tongue swelled and hurt, too.  Eat cold things (Wendy's frosty was great!) and take some anti inflammatory meds (Advil, etc).      For your question on where to get it done, I'm assuming you mean where on your tongue (not the name of a parlor).  Further back on your tongue is better - it interferes with your speech less and you have less of a chance of accidentally biting it and cracking your teeth.  When people talk to me, they have no idea I have my tongue pierced, let alone twice.    Good luck and keep it clean!!!|`|OqD4Z6wpaa	just get lots of ice cream and ice after and get mashed potatos, soups and soft foods because it will be hard to eat for a few days.  and it does not hurt so dont worry about that. but make sure you get it pierced at a good clean place  |`|6XHesUihaa	no offense, but seriously that's desqusting.|`|xQSZxCLxaa	i got my lip pierced at body jewel its a place at the mall. they did an exceptional job...so i went back to get my belly button peirced, they were really good! and they give you lots of tips! and it does hurt but not that much if you breathe out while they put the needle in (wich thell proply tell u to do anyway) it hurts alot less youd be surprised!

But if you want to be super safe salt wash your ears first. it really all depends on what size gage your going too. small ones aren't a big deal.

Also, you can use this online translator. It works really great, and you can put in whatever phrase you want, if you are looking for more than one symbol!  http://www.worldlingo.com/en/products_se...|`|H3PcFertaa	To overcome something, to get past it, you must drop the baggage. By getting a symbol of the very thing that you say that you are done with, you trick yourself into carrying it into your NOW and then into your future. You will never be rid of it. You will always be talking about it, explaining your tattoo, getting the feelings associated with it. etc.  If you are truly serious about not having it in your life, then get a tattoo of an image that is not tainted with it. Something that is clean and stands on its own, and will never be a bridge to a conversation about that which you leave behind.  What are your interest? What makes you happy? What makes you laugh? What do you love? What was put aside in the past because of your negative viewpoint and actions? Get something to proclaim your freedom and your future, by what you decide to get as a tattoo image now.  Then you will be free. And everytime that you look at it, you will feel strong and proud and happy. And when you show it to someone and talk about it, you can do so without bringing up the negative past.  Think about this, and don't trick yourself in to taking it with you into the future.  luck|`|hiY7CCc7aa	I like Bethany's answer of the pic of a razor and blood maybe a pic of a small razor or knife on your wrists or ankle???|`|v5J50Ep2aa	well i used to cut (still do a little) but for my next tattoo im getting a razor   baled tattooed with blood dripping and roses! i know its weird but whenever i look at it will remind me of that stage in my life and how i can overcome it!  you should get whatever relates to your harming! good luck!

oAQib10naa	ok, easiest thing is to practice when it's not on your leg.    Open the clip so that the metal or plastic ring part is not touching the rubbery insert part.  Usually there is a larger end on the ring part.  Once you figure out how to open and close the garter clip all you have to do is put the stocking inbetween and close the clip.  I have found that the front ones are much easier than the back ones when they're on your leg and it takes a little practice to get them hooked so that they're straight.|`|Mq2TICVmaa	I pull my stockings up bit by bit from the ankle until they are as high as they can go, which makes it easier for the top of them to reach the clips. Also, do it while standing. That makes it a lot easier because if you're sitting then they don't reach as well.|`|OkOCOnbTaa	you kinda just slide them together threw the fabric....|`|6c7fd83a47bafae20b3a544bc85a3616aa	the clips should be adjustable to extend down to the top of the stockings. the better garters are like that.     i am tall so i have encountered your problem more than once|`|PhNzEkVnaa	pull up the stocking, slide the "button" part of the clip under the stocking so it sits against your skin, then put the clip over the stocking where the "button" is.  The bigger part of the clip sits right over the button then the smaller part is directly under (the order of layers is leg, button,stocking, clip) , you pull up in the clip so the narrowest part of the clip comes around the button and you are good to go.|`|8eeKI0h0aa	Havn't the foggiest. Just wanted to say that i wish garters and stockings had never gone out of fashion, very sensual.
875db9dbe2ce224475dab7f10775abccaa	Really, the best way is to pop it. Popping isn't usually recommended just because people do it completely wrong and they botch up the whole process.    Here's how:  Well, you said it hurt, so I don't advise that you actually POP it yet. You should put warm compresses on it though, to lead the whitehead more towards the end of the zit.    When your zit doesn't hurt anymore, wash your hands thoroughly and afterwards apply purell. Apply the hot compress once more and pop it from the sides. If it isn't coming out, stop. When it starts bleeding or clear liquid is coming out, stop. Afterwards, apply a spot medication or rubbing alcohol to the spot|`|kGVPOZ3faa	Pop it.|`|3Q9HcfQsaa	its a zit.  it doesnt just go away.  just keep washing it with face wash.  and quit putting your bangs over it to hide it because your hair will make your face oily which will make you get zits on your forehead.  put your bangs up and cover it with make up.  it will go away eventually

Dont wear them all day, but just for like an hour and see how they feel.|`|ZpLFNtTyaa	i would wash them and then leave them out to dry, when they are try the on if they are too loose, wet down with a spray water bottle and put them in the dryer! i do this with sweater sometimes and it works, i hope it does for you, good luck! |`|Ovr8bQ1paa	what are you talking about? of course you should wash them and then dry them. treat them as you wuld any other pair of jeans|`|GwZkKAlVaa	well i usually dry mine so they get tighter again, but it als depends on the brand|`|kN3ujoxzaa	wash them and dry them, all jeans stretch, especially skinny jeans, especially the ones from pac sun, idk where you got yours though so yeah deff wash nd dry  and always dry in machine not on line to keep tight longe|`|yIccy8zMaa	i wash mine then hang them up to dry  it keeps them from shrinking and streching out|`|8UfL6Yenaa	washing and drying them will keep them tight.  if you don't wash them, then they'll continue to stretch out.|`|PhNzEkVnaa	Just wash and air dry them that should bring back the shape without damaging the fibers or shrinking the fabric.

adyNCp6eaa	My sis is around that age, and she wears heels, but only on special occasions. I don't think your sis should be going around school wearing them, because if you wear them like every day as your main pair of shoes, then that is bad for your feet, & like the other commenter said, pre-teens can be called hookers for wearing too high of a heel. But if you wear them to like a dance or a formal thing, then I think it would look good. I'm not so sure about 4 inches tho, we wear like 2-3 inch heels and they don't look too hookerish.(not that your sister looks like a hooker, that was no offense intended, i just think 4in is a little high)|`|jeX5VZAtaa	No she will attract attention from older males.

Most flash (the pics on the walls of the studio) are adaptable anyway.|`|YIplumj8aa	Your best bet would be to find the tattoo artist you plan to use and have him/her draw up your tattoo.  If you bring one in that someone else drew for you, chances are the artist is still going to have to rework it to fit your body and he may need to redraw it so that he will be able to actually tattoo it on.  Do some research and find a few good artists in your area, go into their shops and talk to them about what you want done.  Some may draw it up for you on the spot, others may ask for a deposit to draw it up over a few days.  But at least you will know that it will be on your body exactly as it is on paper.

tfsImr9oaa	honestly i think it would be best with no necklace just nice earrings. Any necklace you put on will look silly with the broach. You don't need earrings and a necklace that is simply to much when you already have a diamond of sparkles on your dress many people make that mistake. Go all out get some chandelier earrings that will complement the diamond shape broach and leave the neck line alone trust me simple is better and  you don't want to take away from that beautiful dress.

e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	Nope! I have relatively inexpensive products and have nice curls. :) If you have that much hair it might take a lot of product however, which will push the price up. Personally I like gel with a cream or leave-in conditioner underneath.    If you want to run out and pick something up locally, I recommend trying the following products:  - Drugstore: L'oreal out of bed weightless texturizer (black tub, use under gel), LA Looks or Herbal essences gels, Suave naturals or vo5 conditioners, L'oreal vive pro hydra gloss or nutri gloss for curly hair, red Cream of Nature shampoo  - Organic/specialty store (like whole foods): Giovanni Direct Leave in condish, G conditioners, G tea tree shampoo, Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose or White Camellia Conditioners, AO B-5 Design gel  - ULTA: Devacurl products, Biosilk rock hard gelee, MOP-c curl defining cream (They also carry drugstore products and giovanni.)    These are all good things I have used, but be sure to tinker around with amounts and how you use any products. For hair type specific products check out these forums:  http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/  There you can find others with the same hair type and try out some of their favorite products. However, the most popular ones are usually only available online.    Here are some basic tips for curly hair that you might find helpful:  *Try to find a stylist who knows how to work with curly hair. You can find reviews by region here: http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons  *Don't shampoo every day.  *Comb conditioner through hair in the shower.  *Apply styling products to dripping wet hair. Scrunch or twirl hair to achieve desired shape.  *Use styling products suited for your hair type. Dont know yours? http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types  *Avoid terrycloth towels on hair; use linen, paper towels, or t-shirts instead.  *Air dry or use a diffuser with your blowdryer.  *Don't touch (or brush!) your hair while its drying.  *Once completely dry scrunch out any crunchy texture.    Lastly, it has made my hair so much better since I started the curly girl method! I used to almost never wear it down (it was a frizz/poof ball), but now I have pretty, shiny curls. ~:) Its pretty radicalno sulfates (shampoo) or siliconesbut its so great for curly hair.

I know you asked for products, but I hope you don't mind other recommendations also. :-)  I have *very* naturally curly hair, and have had it for most of my life. lol  My mother gave me a Toni home perm back in the early 80s when I was very young and had stick-straight hair.  Funny thing is, ever since then I've had nothing but wild curls. hehe    Anyway...my suggestions aren't for products. Quite honestly (I'm not ashamed to admit) I use SUAVE everything.  From shampoo, to conditioner, to styling products and they work wonderfully for me.  I think you can save a lot of money simply be implementing other things rather than worrying about which products to use. :)    1) Eliminate the blow dryer!! I don't blow-dry my hair *ever* unless I have a diffuser attached.  There are diffusers in most general stores such as WalMart, Target, etc..that aren't expensive.  They're adaptable to most brands of blow dryers and attach at the end.  These help *tremendously* with frizz-control!    2) Eliminate the brush.  For best results, use a wide-toothed comb or a hair pick---not a brush.  Brushes have numerous bristles, which split the hair (I'm not talking about split ends).  The bristles on brushes will frizz your hair out. hehe    3) Eliminate the fuss.  Honestly, the more you scrunch, tease, pick at, and 'fuss' with your hair while styling it, the higher chance you have of ending up with a frizzy nest (speaking from experience).  Gently run a pick through your hair after showering, and apply your choice of hair serum, gel, mousse, etc...and then let it dry on it's own.  If you're in a hurry---please refer to  1 and use diffuser to get it to dry faster.  I do have 1 recommendation on styling products though---try to avoid the ones that say "extra hold" or "super hold", because that means STICKY... LOL and once that stickiness dries.....frizz city if you happen to run your fingers through your hair.  :)  I stay with a gentle styling cream by Suave (any of them work)...so you can remain frizz-free and your hair is still touchable without having to wear protective gloves. hehe    4) It's in the haircut.  Curly lox need some weight so they don't fly flippantly around everywhere like a spinning top! :)  I recommend staying away from short layers, and leaning more toward longer layers.  This will give you some body and 'poof' without the frizz, and will also help your hair look more uniform instead of being one-length and curly in some places while straight in others.    Good luck---and enjoy your hair!     :o)|`|iNneJk47aa	http://productsthatwork.rare-boutique.co...|`|EcdelIHtaa	mousse and hair spray work fine wen ur hairs wet..|`|8lTjwBEzaa	Use grease and not a lot of mousse grease will keep your hair moisterized and won't make your dirty like gel does when it dries up. I suggest blue magic no bad chemicals and they have one that smells like coconut it smells really good.    You can get it at WAL-MART|`|AA10783186	Either mousse or gel work well for curly/wave hair, just whichever you prefer. The only thing I suggest it to make sure the product that you use it water based instead of alcohol based. Alcohol based products will dry your hair and make it brittle and feel like straw. If you use a water based it will look and feel softer.    I use Aussie products, they work and smell great!|`|n3akm5u6aa	none all u have to do for a good results wash with moisturizing shampoo and leave in conditioners comb through with wide tooth comb twice a month use an intensive conditioner or hot oil treatment (or try the treatment at the end ) when dry don't rub your hair with towel, squeeze excess water into towel apply an anti-frizz styling cream or serum to hair while its still wet and leave to dry naturally. or u can use a dryer with a diffuser and only moderate heat and never tip the head upside down(only tip when hair is too flat). your going to cause frizz. if your hair goes flat at top when you sleep just tip head over and massage hair near to the scalp in a circular motion this give volume and wake up ur look    treatment - 1/2 cup olive oil, 10 drops Lavender essential oil    place olive oil in a small saucepan and warm it gently(the oil should not be hot just heated) remove and  add the Lavender oil.double check the temperature, apply the mixture to your hair wrap it in a towel to maximize oil penetration and relax for 20 Min's wash out oil with a gentle shampoo (you may need to repeat 2-3 times)and condition well.

RChBFKdWaa	sunsilk and pantene are very bad for your hair, aswell as pretty much all supermarket brands.  get shampoo and conditioners from biosilk or paul mitchell you can get them from hairdressers, hairhousewarehouse, price attack, etc.  also every now and again use heavy cream treatment from redken its really gooood !  if she has split and frazzled ends get them trimmed off it will make alot of difference|`|4Xmr0Yjlaa	try selsum blue,head and shoulders,and when she gets out of the bath put gell on her scalp and maybe even lotion on her scalp i would help the dryness go away|`|jeX5VZAtaa	Try Hello Hydration by Herbal Essences.

You can buy it in a little bottle and put a dime size in her hair every time she gets out of the shower and then blow dry it in. You can always get deep conditionings at salons for like 20 bucks but I personally dont think they always work. Does she use a straightener? Because any kind of heat like that will dry your hair out in a heart beat. Make sure you arent buying any hair products from walmart, grocery store or the drug store.. Even if they are a more expensive kind because they are actually mixed with different products, and they arent if you buy them in a salon or at a local beauty store. Sometimes washing your hair can really dry it out too, You're only suppose to wash your hair every other day so make sure she is doing that. Try using a spray in conditioner when she gets out of the shower and see if you can find one with some sunscreen in it for her hair because believe it or not the sun can really dry the hair out. I went thru this for so long and I wish you the best of luck! :)|`|rzIxb6QZaa	I had really dry/damaged hair after bleaching my hair like 4 times in a a month to go back blonde from brown.  it took like a year to grow out and now my hair is always dry , i do think that tresemme moisture soak shampoo and conditioner is goood and also aussie hair products! like the reconstructor deep conditioner and leave in conditioners. hair products after youve dried your hair i would recommend avon advance techniques daily results dry ends serum, it sorta softens your hair and makes it look as if its not dry.|`|b24104f4cf66187aab3d9510fdf1cae5aa	one thing i found to really help me with that is, believe it or not... extra virgin olive oil. real talk, but that in the hair and let it set for 3-5 mins and wash out REALLY GOOD. it makes the scalp and hair full of moisture.
PpfXb1Rsaa	Hey!    I think, that red would suit you more because you are fairly dark.   Although I guess you could try purple     (blue+red=purple, get it?

Buy an electric guitar necklace since she plays this instrument. She always have those Wayfarer sunglasses with her so why not, when you're outside.     Put on a bit of pink blush and a bit of dark eyeliner (it don't have to be major) and some nude lipstick or gloss and you,re ready to go :)|`|EwtCmQctaa	Demi Lovato is usually quite natural looking, but if your not allowed to much make up at school go for a simple face, use foundation if you need to & concealer!  Then for the eyes - mascara is your friend :D use a fair bit so that its dark!  & if you feel you need to a small bit of smudged eyeliner so it looks natural!  Save the over dramatic eyes for the nights out!    & for the hair you can either completely copy it - dye it brown get straight bangs :)   I personally liked her hair kind of wvy so you can either leave it straight or add waves but once again Demi is very natural looking so don't have it poker straight else it won't be natural enough:D You cam always buy clip in extensions if your hair isnt long enough :D  have fun with thaaaaaaat|`|WuEcETAlaa	get a haircut like hers, and kind of go for the smokey eye makeup look but keep it kinda low key if you arent allowed to wear much makeup for school,    in this video tutorial she does one of demi lovatos look but its not really the dark eye makeup  http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=50bN6ljUN8...      sooo you could try this one (its in two parts)  http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=BPcFgCWE04...  http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=VIhEEds7hT...    xxx

I know one great cream called pentatyl.Pentaxyl is a proprietary blend of herbal extracts and the breakthrough formulas of the Matrixyl Complex and Argireline which reduce the severity of wrinkles and furrows, help to thicken and firm the skin, and improve the texture and color that is lost from aging and environmental factors. Pentaxyl has harnessed the age-fighting power of "bio-peptide" technology, with three age-fighting bio-peptides (1) Pamitoyl-Pentapeptide-3 (Matrixyl) (2) Palmitoyl Oligopeptide (3) Acetyl Hexapeptide-3 (Argireline). Peptides are a low molecular weight amino acid groups that are building blocks of proteins that make up plants and animals.  Palmitoyl_Pentapeptide-3 are based on wound-healing peptide discovered at National Institute of Health, which mimics human collagen fragments that appear to "fool" fibroblast into producing dermal matrix materials, which thickens dermis similar to Retinol, but without negative side effects.     With Pentaxyl you no longer have to suffer from embarrassing stretch marks. Pentaxyl is clinically proven to reduce the appearance of stretch marks, safely and effectively. Typically after only four to six weeks the depth of stretch marks is dramatically reduced. Each day the skin will take on a more "lifted" appearance and within four weeks, the radiance will be restored as skin discoloration fades. Over time the skin will be transformed to a more youthful appearance. While nothing can rewind time, Pentaxyl has been shown to restore a beautiful, resilient, flawless skin by fighting against the affects of aging and repairing the damage done by the environment. visit www.marketamerica.com/plusu|`|pVpQuWXzaa	well uses moisturizer cream is what i will do first. If it doesn't get better then try something else like losing weight not to much and still moisturize. 3 if nothing works even if you found more solutions the best and most effective way is surgery. You will never know that you had them. Maybe ask the Doctors its a Tv show on at 3-4 (eastern time) on ABC. Just right in and they might right back and most of the times you get surgery and stuff for free but that probably wont happen so do what i said first.|`|8e78ab3e9f61fd825a86ea5e1c7c2e92aa	StriVectin, its expensive and its supposed to be used for wrinkles but women use it for stretch marks more than anything.

I have to say, she has her own style and watching the change in her wardrobe this year and last has been an experience, but I like seeing Jennifer Love-Hewitt, because she doesn't buy into the "everyone look like a rail" style of "beauty."  She does understand style and does not buy into the idea that women must look either emaciated or slutty.      Just make sure your curves are firm, and somewhere long the line the sense of embarrassment will shift into a knowledge of having an asset.  (Wide hips ease childbearing, and guys are hardwired into attraction to traits that support survival of the species.  A college classmate from my church group was a terrible tease, and I got him back once.  He was trashing everything about my looks, ending with the wide hips, and I just said "well, you've got to admit one thing:  I'm made for making babies."  I'd just thrown in the towel, giving up the conversation as hopeless - but he turned a bright purply red and couldn't get any words out.  The rest of the walk was peaceful, and he never, ever teased me that hard again.)|`|8bc5ef4c5efab964e0a598b04c4f2f86aa	only 2 things you can do.

Take a shower everyday and use those buffer pads to help remove the dead skin faster, combined with the lotion it'll go so much faster.

I also hear vitamin E oil works well too. Use the pill capsules and break them open and rub those in 2 times a day and they should start clearing up in time.|`|8jKvUJISaa	What a bunch of naysayers!  You can get rid of stretchmarks!  I know I did by using a cream called Revitagen.  People say you can't get rid of stretchmarks with a cream  because ingredients can't get past the upper skin layers.  Thing is striae, the technical term for stretchmarks are tears in the skin.  Products like Revitagen are formulated to repair the torn layers  found beneath the skin's surface.  Think about it, the patch is so effective because it delivers medicine through the skin into the blood stream.   Revitagen will also work faster than cocoa butter because the special formula is geared for stretch marks.  Check out this stretch mark cream review at http://www.stretchmarkcream.org/reviews/...  this review will tell you everything you need to know about Revitagen.  I used it and  you can't tell I am  a mother of a three year old!|`|pfm0wcEIaa	I have searched and searched for a scientific study to corroborate my observations and I haven't found one.  But I am certain this works.    You need to stop eating hydrogenated oils (aka trans fats or fried foods) and replace them with good fats like walnuts, flax and fish oil.  You also need to moisturize.  Cocoa butter is a good choice, but whatever you find most suitable, preferably some food grade moisturizer.  If you choose some kind of oil (for example olive oil) you need to use it after you shower or as some sort of scrub (like mix it with sugar an rub lightly and rinse).  I don't know why this is, but if you just use plain food grade oil on dry skin, it gets both dry and oily.    It is interesting to take note that if this is the case [that hydrogenated oils cause stretch marks] this has some much more serious implications as to what it may be doing to your arteries.  Arteries are made up of the same type of layers that skin is made out of, but arteries constrict and expand to twice their size regularly throughout the day.  It is my impression that if your skin is getting scars, just imagine what your arteries might look like (OMG!).  Scarred arteries cause inelasticity which can cause all kinds of cardiovascular issues...    I have observed that people who eat at home don't get stretch marks.  I have also noticed that my mother nor my aunts never had stretch marks even through pregnancy.  But when they started eating at McD's in the 80's they started getting stretch marks.  All my cousins and I have experienced stretch marks... so stretch marks can't be genetic.  It has to be something that changed with the time.    I put on very little weight when I was a teenager (possibly 30 lbs over 5 years and 5 inches) and I had tons of stretch marks.  During this time I was eating lots of hydrogenated oils.  In contrast, during my mid 20's, I put on 30 lbs in one month (as a result of undiagnosed diabetes) and I experienced almost no stretch marks.  During this time hydrogenated oils were not part of my diet.    I hope this helps.|`|rHKW1CJJaa	huh? dont listen to that first answer that girl is insecure,, bleaches her hair and gets plastic surgery... you dont wanna be like her      and ofcourse they can go away... start toning your body and you will see results.. im sure they arent even as bad as you think|`|dcd11iUwaa	guess what..YOU CANT|`|6sAOBn4maa	cocoa butter will work well.|`|Iuf1f4s0aa	Well there really isnt a way to but after awhile they fade into a pale color and no one will notice.

Heres what you have to do:    Step One: Remove Unwanted Hair  Step Two: Exfoliate  Step Three: Moisturise  Step Four: Apply Self-Tan  Step Five: Let it dry|`|9iXGakohaa	Either use tanning lotion, or get spray tanned. Not only are those the healthiest options for everyone but they are especially true for the super pale. You will avoid burns, damage, and all the risks associated with tanning beds or lying in the sun by using the creams or sprays.|`|ioGCMeAeaa	uh? maybe a tanning bed?|`|ZvLmuCiOaa	lol.   i'm whiter  i can almost gauruntee it  i don't tan ever  just be proud who you are.  oh and if you wanna tan try tanning lotion (it is different than sunscreen)  it didn't work for me because i am REALLY white. i burnt.   and then my mom said blah blah skin cancer blah blah  but yea don't worry. i'm whiter.|`|uv0Y7Ar8aa	You can use the tanning cream out of a bottle. But it is a mess. And takes alot more to keep it up. But it dose work.|`|EPVW8Ukeaa	Just think of all the gorgeous pale skinned celebrities out there like Scarlett Johannsen, Kirsten Dunst, and Rachel McAdams to name a few. But I can understand you wanting a touch of color so I would recommend sunless tanning lotion. You just put a little on each day and the color builds up. It's much better than a tanning bed or a spray tan because those can be orange and blotchy which is not a good look for anyone.     Hope I helped!|`|5wlaSksXaa	go to a taning bed place once a week for 5 mins and just let time go and grow your time or wait for the summer and get an natrual tan|`|Ck9BRWnxaa	ermmm,  either get a spray tan or fake tan. i have this moisturizer which is dove, its in this light brown plastic bottle and it says it gradually builds a light tan:)  hope this helps! xx|`|CFCjBjOeaa	you can lay aluminum foil out and lay on it in the sun be sure  you wear sun tan lotion when you come in cover your skin in a plant called an aloe plant i am serious it really works.|`|kEZRF9D2aa	either go tanning for little amounts of time and then gradually go more times a week for longer amounts of time.    also you could get a spray tan. where i go tanning theyre only $25.    don't use tanning lotions. they are very streaky and turn orange. also they stain your hands and it just looks really fake.|`|FHui30aeaa	Let them laugh as they will get skin cancer and you will not.  tanning is the leading cause of skin cancer.

IYvenrU7aa	try shaving it all off  BAHAHa sorry  Cut most of the damage, let your hair heal for a while, I know how hard it is to stop straightening your hair, but say you wear foundation every day, and it makes you break out. Would you stop wearing that foundation? Yes. So stop straightening your hair in till it becomes healthy again and once it does, use  Albertos heat-defiance spray, it is in a little blue spray bottle, and you spray it before you straighten and sometimes after  good luck, hope I helped

Some people might think that is a little long but just to be on the safe side you should do it.|`|JOR9dSSuaa	wait until they reach your top lip or the bottom of your nose. all it is is normal bangs brushed to the side... just extra long  good luck :]]|`|mFt8uuLAaa	777|`|Y7aX72C6aa	well i have long-ish blunt bangs and if I'm not in the mood for them bothering me i push them to the side and they automatically become side swept bangs. but if your bangs aren't that long right now, you should probably wait about a month to  2 months depending on how fast your bangs grow out to get them professionally cut again into side bangs!  goodluckk honey

If it's working for you, go for it. everybody's hair is different. you have to find the formula that works for you.|`|K97esxDsaa	YES it is okay, and many, many people do this.     Shampoo contains chemicals that damage your hair and dry out your scalp, making your scalp overproduce oil in an effort to keep your skin balanced.    It will take a few weeks for your body to adjust and your hair will look oily in that time, but eventually you'll be able to stop using shampoo entirely and just use conditioner to wash sweat and dead skin from your hair and scalp in the shower every day.|`|2vyT8Zoraa	no its not okay shampoo washes the build up and impurities out and the conditioner gives oil and moisture and takes the shampoo out when your just using conditioner its going to make your hair look greasy and mess up the ph balance in your hair|`|c89J6VFEaa	no   I wouldn't it will look greasy!|`|w5sek8YNaa	NO!! The shampoo cleans your hair!! Teh conditioner moisturises. If you condition your hair more than you shampoo, it would be like not showereing at all. You need to shampoo your hair!|`|ng3A9Pgqaa	You shouldn't wash your hair everyday because it dries out your hair or makes it really greasy. But if you must wash it everyday, using only conditioner isn't that bad because it doesn't dry out your hair like shampoo does.|`|ZrIK2ehpaa	i think whatever is best for your hair, you should do it. But I recomend not using the same shampoo each time because you don't want your hair to get used to it.|`|wGQvgeXDaa	Stop shampooing and use dove moisturizer soap to clean your hair instead. Then use a conditioner. Works for me, tell me if it works for you.|`|pFlQLa4Laa	Your hair needs to been clean but your hair has natural oils that it needs. I recommend that you get like a moisturizing and/or volume shampoo and wash it every 2-3 days. Then get the same for conditioner. You either need to get a leave-in conditioner or a deep conditioner(I use Garnier) and use it twice a week. I personally love the deep conditioners especially when they have a hint of mint, it is so relaxing it gives your head a tingling feeling. Though it takes out the color if you dye your hair. Just some more advice hot water dries out your hair, use tolerable cool/warm water.|`|YybxuUkraa	I think your hair turns Greecy just using conditioner|`|XxlFLnataa	as long as it doesnt make your hair greasy its fine.  after all. it IS conditioning your hair...if it works for you, then do it!!|`|Vn4Z3yfaaa	NO it is not ok just to wah with conditioner. that is bad for your hair. your hair will get hard and it will get tangling and everuthing

b0k7DyoSaa	Well for me people always come up and touch my hair cause it's so soft. All I do is use Herbal Essences shampoo and conditioner.Then I let it air dry and after that I straighten it. It's the straightening that does the trick. If you do use a hair straightener, make sure it's not too hot because that will dry out your hair and give it static and damage it.|`|ThP9eK1Paa	Really good products to make your hair look soft is Pantene Ice shine, Sunsilk hydra TLC, and Brushing your hair after a night shower.

WCYEHwEIaa	a 120GB won't take all of your allowance, but it will definitely leave you without much of a shopping budget. Check craigslist, kijiji.com, and ebay for an ipod that you want, then weigh your options :)|`|9rQzQxexaa	well if you dont have an ipod, then buy one. its totally worth it, especially if you always listen to music like i do.  but if youre really not all that into music, but are just buying one for the sake of saying you own an ipod, then dont bother. $400 is a lot of money to spend, so you should spend it wisely on stuff you know youll use and get good use out of)  my old ipod lasted me longer than some of my clothes did (just saying) and then i got a new one, and its totally worth it.  if not, get a cheaper ipod (i think its $200) and then spend the other $200 on clothes & shoes. thats still plenty of money.  good luck!|`|usxeet5vaa	First of all, think of this...  Do you really need 120 gb in an iPod? Are you going to by ALL those songs? Do you NEED all those songs? ARe you going to listen to all those songs? If you are, then buy an iPod. If you already have an iPod, then you don't need another one, unless its broken, or there's no more room for songs. In that case, buy an iPod, but choose wisely. you may not need so many songs, so stick with a smaller one.     If you think you already have enough clothes, shoes, bags etc., then don't buy so much stuff. Remember- its' you rmoney, and you can spend a little bit on clothes, a little bit on some other stuff. Maybe buy a pair of jeans and shoes, and be done with, what, 50 bucks or more. Then you can spend the rest on an iPod. You'll probably have some extra money, so save it!! Of course, don't spend all your money! It's good to have some money so when something new comes out and you're like "Oooh! I sooo want that," you can get it because you have the bucks!     You could also buy some video games like guitar hero or rock band or the wii or somehting if you don't already have them.     If you want to spend all your money on clothes, then you can, but I wouldn't because I already have lots of clothes. Maybe I'd buy a pair of jeans, and some shoes, and a few shirts, but that's all.     Hope this got you thinking, and you wont blow your money on something you don't really need!|`|Kb0p6mcJaa	get an 8 gb ipod & clothes & shoes.  foreal, yu dont need 120 gb.  1020 songs is only about 4.92 gb.|`|9spFdUoxaa	you could level everything out.    lets just the ipod is $230. (its actually on sale on amazon if you buy online)    You spend $230 on the ipod. You have $170 left for whatever. Thats a pretty good amount of money to spend on clothes!
u5mqmRoBaa	I used to work at MAC haha. That's a good product too. Don't put too much on that's my first advice especially if you want to look natural. Buffer some of the foundation onto the brush or sponge. Always start with the center of your face. From the nose to the forehead, cheeks, and chin. Blend it going outwards towards your jawline and hair. It's important that you blend it at your hairlines and jawline. Make sure you have distributed the make up even. Take a step back from the mirror and examine that you have made it look even and it is blended in. To rid of excess makeup, lightly dab a tissue around your face.|`|hd9sNn1uaa	use the foundation brush ...190 i think
AA12367392	A lot of women go through this, usually over a period of time thats why you don't notice, but if this has been sudden its best to go see your doctor, better safe than sorry, goodluck! :)|`|0UYJkSuZaa	Unless you have had breast implants, you will have one breast that is slightly larger than the other. Some women actually have a full cup difference. If you are worried that the difference may be too great you can speak to your doctor about it to make sure there isn't something wrong with your hormones and glands.|`|uv0Y7Ar8aa	One side of your body is always larger than the other. This happens to everyone is life some notice more so than others. Nothing you can really do.|`|LvI4jRd8aa	not really, but it's normal and usually you're the only one who notices so no worries|`|xoLGphSBaa	Yes, but it takes a bit of time.  One of my aunts developed the same thing the summer she taught her boys to swim.  She used sidestroke on the same side all the time, while giving instruction and encouragement, What I don't remember if the side seeing the most use was the larger or smaller one, but I think it was the larger.      You need to self-observe, to see what you are doing to over-exercise one side, then develop a regimen emphasizing effort on the opposite side.  It is likely to take months to show a change, at least two or three.  However, this is a good thing - if you hadn't noticed, you would have continued to shift even further out of balance.  And most folks just are not going to notice.|`|g4fRPhsMaa	It's normal, you'll grow into it in a way where it isn't as noticeable.  Get a good bra? Ha, tissue?  I have no clue, but good luck (:|`|d8b6703f3fe553c8173f1543b80dcc85aa	I asked my doctor about that when it happened to me and she said that it gows away "when your done growing".    i was like, WTF? right? lol, but i guess it is just simply time. =[[|`|XdPstcwsaa	It depends on how old you are. If you are still in high school than you will even out. But here is what I recommend. Making one bra strap tighter than the other for a little bit and checking yourself in the mirror a one or two days after. Or it might be the bra you are wearing, or possibly buy a new bra.|`|lcfOYn2Faa	You can get a push up bra. And then if they are not even yet you can put some tissue on one side to even it out.

ljqr3saeaa	I use the same styli pencil that Lisa Bons mentioned. I actually had a professional makeup artist friend of mine refer it to me. I thought it would be crap since its only $2, but its ALWAYS sold out when I try to go buy it. So I bought it and have been using it since, one of the BEST eyeliners. I use a lot of pricey brand makeups and this is one of the best for a pencil liner.    Good luck!|`|sGhgJHjhaa	theres this brand called styli style and you can get it at cvs now. when i used to wear pencil liners that's what i used. its supposed to stay on for 24 hours... i didn't wear my makeup for that long but it did last the whole day. now im using a gel liner from coastal scents. its like 6 bucks for the liner itself, and it comes in a bunch of colors, and 2 bucks for the brush. it wasn't that bad and i looove that stuff! it has the darkness of a liquid but it's easier to use. and it doesn't smear! you can get it at www.coastalscents.com|`|d299f1977edc0e3454fa0aec50ef4b49aa	um to that last answerer i USE Maybelline Unstoppable in the twisty pencil form.  it does smear, even the waterproof one.  it's cheap. buy the better brands.  what you pay is what you get..|`|d2fVJ4Ouaa	Maybelline Unstoppable.

I promise it would only be like this  much . that dot. It is amazing, but you gotta know how to apply it with the brush, but it is very easy to do. plenty of videos on youtube. It is compared to mac's fluid line H.I.P is cheaper and more product, once again just as good if not better.        Ulta Automatic eyeliner about $7 I believe when I bought it online [10/10]  L'oreal's H.I.P Cream eyeliner, about $11-$15 depends where you buy it. Yes it's a little pricey but it lasts forever. I have been using mine for  a year if not longer and i still have about half the product left. And I use it on the top and bottom lash lines and little goes a VERY long way.

But if it really bothers you ask ur mom to make you an orthodontist appointment...they can give you a clear retainer to close it up.
154dzJ1Faa	Sorry to say, but there are a few incorrect things in Lauren's answer.    Hair does not grow out of a pore.  A pore is where sweat comes out to the surface of the skin.  Hair grows from a follicle.  The root is at the bottom, and that is the live part of hair.  As the cells reproduce, it pushes the older hair out to the surface of the skin, and then you can see it.    It is true that if you can destroy the root, the hair will never grow back.  That can sometimes happen if you pull the hair out, but very rarely.  It is true that the follicle will close slightly when there is no hair in it, and when the hair does grow back, it might be finer, but don't count on it.    The hair cannot be any different than it was -- as it is programmed to be -- when it grows back.  That is the same thing as colouring your hair... it always grows back as it was.  We tend to forget very fast what colour we had!! haha    It is not true that shaving will make the hair darker and thicker.  Impossible for the reason above.  Nothing you do on the surface is going to change the way the hair grows.  Just can't be done.    An ingrown hair is caused by the hair growing under the top layer of the skin rather than coming out to the surface.  This happens most often with curly hair and when shaving.  The sharp edges of the cut hair from shaving cause the hair to cut into the layer of the skin, especially if there is any blockage of the follicle at the surface of the skin.  The hair can get infected, inflamed and cause more skin problems.    Waxing will remove ALL the hair on the upper lip.  Usually you need a very soft downy growth of hair to give the skin a soft appearance.  Usually you will have more hair in neighbouring areas of your upper lip, and when you remove part of it, it is very noticeable since it will be very naked, and the section right next to it is not!  You just don't know where to stop. Because the hair grows out with a soft point, it doesn't normally get ingrown, but curly hair is always a problem, especially if you have blocked the follicle in some way (make-up, dead skin, dried oil).    Bleaching lightens the colour of the hair, so that it is not as obvious, but if it is long, now you will have longer blonde hair!  Again, the rest of your skin has darker hair too, giving you your complexion colour, so you can't just do part and not the rest.    I am venturing to say that you do not have dark hair on the upper lip that needs to be removed.  As you said, it is not noticeable unless you really stare at it.  I think you are just creating a problem out of nothing, and will only make things worse.  Of course, I can't see you, but it's rare for any girl of your age to have dark hair on the upper lip.|`|QdQcAHqaaa	Wax. As the hairs get pulled out, the pore closes up a little more each time until eventually the hair will never grow back, and certainly not darker and thicker (that is true of shaving though - not that you should be  shaving your face). Ingrowns occur where the hair is very thick like the bikini line, not at fine hairs like on the upper lip.    Besides, bleach won't make your face nice and smooth like a wax.
HBFHZXybaa	During the weekdays Monday-Friday mornings. It's usually empty. Even on Monday-Thursday afternoons. Friday is a whole different story! lol!|`|m25lpepOaa	Sunday would probably be less crowded than Saturday. Watch out though, because on Sunday most malls close early.|`|0JcJedLcaa	ha.  uhmm. like probably sunday.   just because of church, and also saturday EVERYONE is off.  so not big crowds in the morning becuase of church and not big after like 6 because of school.  but if its just a regular weekend not like black friday or anything it shouldnt be like insanely crowded   i mean itll be a bigger crowd then mon-fri. but not hugee..|`|A8awRQWtaa	Heh... the only time I know is early in the morning or on weekends     "We can't go early in the morning and we can't go on weekdays. Only Saturday and Sunday. Those are our only choices."    The same for most people, is why its always crowded at those times, I think this question is something that you could have solved without asking this intnet|`|Jnr7Eu7Jaa	i think sundays r less crowded. maybe in at night or in the morning. that way people are at chruch? idk thats my guess and theres school the next day so they might not be there at night. good question tho.|`|0Solhxvgaa	weekdays first thing in the morning right when they open its wonderful. i always go then. if you can go then go early right when they open saturday or right when they open sunday. i think saturdays are busier days. since you cant go you will have to just try and manage the crowds becaue it is really busy on saturdays adn i dont think it is as busy on sundays. so i would say as early as you can get there on sunday.
WCYEHwEIaa	Satin polka-dot tea length or knee length dress with crinoline showing.  black stilettos. matching, solid colored wrist gloves. heavy eye make up. Maybe dye a section of hair underneath to match the dress. Cute, but gothy.|`|9aDt4X8caa	When you go to the theater you should always dress up. It shows respect to the actors and the people who have put so much time and effort in to the play :) Here's and outfit to try    http://www.polyvore.com/untitled/set?id=...  http://www.polyvore.com/untitled/set?id=...   Hope I helped :) xoxo~A|`|WzYLX0Fmaa	this dress  http://www.hottopic.com/hottopic/store/p...    these shoes  http://www.hottopic.com/hottopic/store/p...    these earrings  http://www.hottopic.com/hottopic/store/p...    I would wear silver eyeshadow (like "silver ring" by Mac makeup), a little black eyeliner on your top lid near the eyelashes, black mascara, and a clear lipgloss. It depends on how long your hair is. If it's short, I would tease it a bit to make it look messy and put cute hair clips in it. If it's longer, I would probably do big loose curls. hope that helped.|`|vhXbGB8naa	You don't have to dress up for broadway anymore.    http://www.polyvore.com/night_look/set?i...    That would be cute though.
I0GqKJ0aaa	I have long hair too. I just think it's beautiful. It's more natural looking and lots of people like to change their hair up a lot, whether it be chemically or dyeing it or whatever. I have kept my hair natural for a long time now, so it is really pretty, shiny, thick and soft. I barely ever use any hot tools on it so that helps. I don't know, some people look better with shot hair but I think coloring it and stuff a lot is kind of dumb. It's fun a few times but why can't people just be happy with what they have? I guess it's just being able to keep your hair long and in good shape is what makes it beautiful :)|`|VkXv4RInaa	some people like it for the handlebar effect|`|1Q4GTAwdaa	I have long hair and love it.  You can actually do stuff with it.  Tie it back, funky styles etc...    With short hair you are pretty much stuck in the same style until it grows a bit.    I've noticed older ladies seem to like long hair.  Maybe it takes them back to their days of youth and dolls.    When it comes to anything fashion (including hair) everyone is a critic and an expert.  But if you are happy with it, then who are they to judge.  You cut it when you're ready to cut it, hon.|`|E6xoudgcaa	People like long hair because it's seen as VERY feminine. I aggree, all hair lengths are pretty, and those people who are bugging you to cut it, they need to mind their own business! x]|`|vhXbGB8naa	I don't know, it's just a culture thing. I really love long hair, it's so fun.|`|TaZvxS7Saa	It's feminine, and VERY noticeable. I had waist-length hair (just cut it last month), and my hair would be the first thing people would notice and comment on. Plus, many could only dream of having long hair, that's why the importance given to long hair.|`|eymIFsYOaa	maybe cause lots of people like long hair, they think it suits you, or they like the quality of your hair? XDDD
cdf9bde60acfd0a622e4bbdccdc9e515aa	I would wait until your skin heals (a day or two). You are not going to get a tan if you go tomorrow - your burn will simply get worse. It needs time to heal. Try putting some aloe vera or vitamin E gel on it. Don't worry, you won't lose whatever color you've gotten so far. It would take more than a couple days to fade. Also, like you said, it's a good idea next time to go in for fewer minutes. Feel better.|`|fc5KHr6aaa	I would still go...just keep the burned area moist with lotion, and the rest of your body for that matter. Find some good after sun lotion to put on. As long as you cover up the sensitive areas and only stay for 7 minutes you should be fine. But after that I would wait a day or two to let everything soak in and calm down.|`|HLmd17r9aa	Well, just because you can only SEE the burn on your stomach area, doesn't mean that the rest of your skin is not burnt underneath. My suggestion to you would be to wait 2 days and then go in again. When you do, the towel idea will definitely work. I would also recommend going only 6 minutes, not 7. Once you can go in for 6 minutes without burning, increase your time by 2 minutes, and keep going about it that way.    In the meantime, put some aloe vera on the burnt skin and try not to tan again until it fades more or goes away.|`|bu6BhCnpaa	i work at a tanning salon...i see people come in all the time too burnt to go tanning...    anyway...your best bet is to give it a few days to heal and go in without the towel.  using the towel will only cause lines and unevenness.  plus...you may not feel it but the rest of your body might be a little burnt, and you could be dryign your skin out...    liek i said...lots of lotion and let it heal...untill you can tke your fingernail and scratch or rub a towel on the area without that sunburn feeling...give it a tiny rest.  i know its annoying...i hate waiting to tan...or bewing anxious to get back in a bed.  i did that jsut recently...well...my friend did it to me.  she set the bed for 15 when i said 10...i was a tomato...but i let it heal and my next time actually gave me incredible results because i had allowed time to heal and recover.      so yess...the towel will work but its better to jsut take it easy for another day or two and youll be set to have an all over even tan rather than a big line and then some burn and some extra tan...|`|d8b6703f3fe553c8173f1543b80dcc85aa	umm... that happened to me over the summer and i went outside for 10 minutes then went to the bed.  so, i guess it's okay
TAIlyvgyaa	If you mean, will they 'heal' then no.    Just get your hair trimmed by a decent hairdresser every couple of months or so, let the hairdresser know that you are trying to grow it and they won't cut more than you need.|`|yo30g3pPaa	just get it trimmed. They will take the needed amount off.|`|ZyfOtCIJaa	Split ends? If you wanna grow out your hair you need to get it trimmed regularly. Tell your hair dresser that you want to grow out your hair and get rid of split ends. They will know how much to cut off.|`|5J0sIvksaa	No. Cuz their at the end. Usually cut half an inch off every 8 weeks. Use good conditioner!|`|AA11118472	if you look really close at d tips u can see d ends actually split in 2. cut above it. u might need help with d back hair if u don't want to guess amount to trim off but go 2 a professional|`|F9UToz4aaa	No, split ends will not permanently damage your hair. However, if you let them stay too long, you might have to cut your hair to a very short length before they go. Trim your hair regularly, up to the part where they split.|`|SQjJxaOqaa	get it trimmed by a professional about ever 2 months or so  they know how much to cut off|`|38b290732676ef493a4b5d1894115d19aa	No. and you should get it trimmed by a proffesional because they will take off only what needs to and won't butcher your hair. It is good to keep it regularly trimmed. Keep your hair moisturized and it will help with the ends.|`|IStGqIWBaa	No it will not everybody gets it and it depends on how bad the split ends are if its like a half inch loge then take off like an inch.|`|SYfBoFVyaa	No way girl!!! all you need to do is get a small trim. i deal with this problem all the time. in fact, i am getting a hair cut pretty soon cuz of it!!!
4Z8wogroaa	compromise.  ask if there's anything that can be done to get them, if you can do any chores or try to get a higher grade level or any of that crap that parents seem to like.  if not, ask if you can get them for your 16th.  if i were you, one parents consent would be enough for me.   ask her to take you.  it's your body afterall.    but uh.. why is it a competition with your friends to be cool?|`|FZ0sKgvzaa	just tell him that if he doesn't let you, your gonna do it anyway... lol|`|tSvixAGoaa	listen to modeselektor and theres probably no way to change your dads mind if he is over 50. old people are hard wired to think that "signs of rebellion" will set you up for failure. best thing to do is wait till you're older and be on good terms with your dad now. once you're out of the house, do what you want!|`|6UmjlJHTaa	ew that's stupid and ugly

yPTUG6uNaa	Protect your skin from sun as much as possible. The sun is activating factor for melanin. If you protect your skin from sun, you will save lot of damage to skin including keeping these colored patches away.     If you use a product that is photo toxic there are very good possibilities that you will develop melasma. Photo toxic means that the product is safe for use if no sun is present, but will produce allergy as soon as sunrays strike it. Hair dyes are a good example of this. In women during pregnancy and while taking birth control pills, hormones activate the melanocytes in the skin and produce more of melanin-the skin color. You will therefore get the colored patches on the facial skin.
cZU9le4raa	green eyeshadow helps bring out green in hazel/brown eyes, so maybe you could try that to bring out the lightness? or you could try brown eyeshadow to enhance your brown eyes.|`|EXdiDbTTaa	You can try some different kinds of eyeshadow and eyeliner, it may make it seem lighter, just depending on what color you use, and if that doesnt work you can always try having colored contacts, they are like 10 to 15 at some stores.  gooooodluck (;|`|b33b2b841b148ef2f8f73241b4f3bd75aa	They will look different if you wear eye shadow and clothes that make it look like that so try to wear stuff with those colors on your eyes and in your clothes.|`|a4be1be4b4cc54f2bbd664414c1d6995aa	No eyeliner or eyeshadow is going to change your eye color.  You can get colored non prescription contacts in an array of colors!
5wDjXzSraa	The area around a new tattoo will sometimes be sore, especially in such a delicate location. As long as you aren't running a fever with that soreness, you should be okay.    As far as the wrist wraps, the answer is no. Not until you are completely healed (about two weeks) and all flaking or "rawness" is gone. The reason is, you will be putting that bandage in contact with the healing tattoo. As your skin seeps plasma in an attempt to heal, you will scab, and if your bandage is on, likely it will "stick" to any scabbing - which equals bad juju when you take the bandage off. Off with it will come any scabs, and with that, some of your color. This would be as bad as actively picking at your tattoo.     You may have to tough it out, but it will be worth it in exchange for a good heal. Remember to wash thoroughly a few times a day (whenever it's gets sticky/shiny with plasma) and thin layers of ointment.     Congrats on your new work!|`|WLuEIwp5aa	1) Yes, especially on bony areas.  I've got this one tattoo right on top of my hip bone that looked greenish yellow because the skin underneath it was so bruised.  It was definitely sore for a while all around that area.    2) No, don't do it, bad idea.  If you absolutely MUST wrap them, you need to get tefla non-stick bandages to put over your tattoos (they'll let your tattoo breathe so they don't get all totally infested with bacteria, but they won't stick like gauze will) before wrapping your wrist.  It's best to avoid this completely, as wrapping fresh tattoos can lead to infections.  After a week or so it won't be nearly as big a deal to wrap your tattoos, but right now you should really avoid it as much as possible.  If you can, tough it out for the next week at least.|`|N19mmDELaa	http://i110.photobucket.com/albums/n95/s...    those are my wrists. they stayed sore for like 4 days. the swelling eventually went down.     id wait till your wrists totally heal before you wrap them. give it like a month or so. and then when u wrap them, u should let them breathe here and there.     good luck!
Tam4lYMdaa	You should definatley get it cut, no offense but it does NOT look good right now, but its in that stage where its starting to get long. U should get a longer fade and have it shaped into a fohawk, that would look good i bet! Use a pomade and some hairspray to style ur hair into the hawk when u get outta the shower. Make sure ur hair is towel dried a bit. Good luck :-)|`|fj3sHFfRaa	CORRECT ANSWER: Definitely keep it long. It looks way better like that. you look kinda nerdy with it short. And kinda creepy, but with it long you might actually be kinda attractive. Plus, when it's long you can do whatever you want with it. If it's short you gotta look like a freak forever until it's long enough to do something with it again. Keep it long but not too long. (:|`|5snRxMS5aa	i think if u cut it not too short it would look cute on you!!!  i think u should cut it but it lookss so cute the way it is right now!!!!|`|TF4nZhvAaa	I like the longer length better :D|`|LfuUaWu2aa	i say cut it short. i think guys usually look better with short hair. i convinced by boyfriend to cut it really short for prom a few years ago and it looks so much better now and i dont think he will ever go back to hair thats your length. i know you dont wanna look dumb it will grow back and people will forgot wat you looked like if u end up not liking it. have fun try something new. go short like down to a 4 on clippers.

Do NOT get a thick, warm hoodie, it will make you look bigger. Make sure the material is thin, and it has a zip. Wear the hoodie off shoulder with the zip down to show your t-shirt.    Get a belt in your size and abit bigger, and hand it loosely over your skirt and jeans. Get it as loose as you can possibly get it without it falling off, preferably a studded belt.    Stick some cool converse on, and you're set.    Yes, the emo trend normally caters for skinny people, but if you like the style you can grasp abit of it as a bigger person (girl, I am assuming) too.|`|N19mmDELaa	be yourself.     wanting to be something else that your not is being a poser.   especially emo... blah. you'll get made fun of big time at school for being a poser...     just be yourself.|`|xAdOhtaoaa	if it looks like crap then dont wear it !|`|4yTx07Pxaa	its not good to categorize yourself...its like being a poser. and im sure you'd look better in some other clothes anyway. but if thats what you like, then make it look good on you.|`|w6tQEuKCaa	???why do u ppl just say i want to be emo??thats dumb..like forreal...where a happy bunny shirt...and some bright falshy colors..obviously it wasnt meant to be if you cant do it right...and to answer your question no its not rigth for a fat person to be emo.{yet alone anyone|`|5EEN5vo5aa	be yourself.|`|RRsewhcFaa	Be whoever you want to be, just be true to yourself.

It doesn't work like that.  You're not 'emo' just because of what you decide to wear one day.  Do you listen to awesome bands that the US has barely heard of yet?  (for example, Lostprophets, Amber Pacific, the Always, The Blaqk Year, etc...)  I'm not saying I'm an expert, I'm just saying that you have to have the 'emo' attitude, and you can't turn emo.  You either are or you aren't.  More likely than not, you're a poser.  Sorry, but it's the truth.  Dress how you want, but people will call you a poser.|`|jTsQkuhHaa	Check out Hot Topic, black pants are slimming and cute for curvy girls..  The patterns on a lot of the shirts are way cute too..

Why can't you just appreciate that god gave you life and stop whining about everything! And for those that don't believe in god just be happy you have a pulse! Life's tough but you dont have to go cut yourself about every little thing that goes wrong. And what makes me angry is that more than half of the emo people out there don't have anything to be emo about! Your all just a bunch of attention whore's. There's people that get raped, abused and **** and they don't cut themselves! So just stop! No one cares really.|`|24b83f678e7655178fc81d2732be81aeaa	If by "want to be emo" you mean you like the emo style then why should it matter what size you are? I think that if you like something, or think it's cute you should wear it. ^^ What ever you think fits your style because it's so much better to be yourself than be poser :(|`|YIH3lkHhaa	imo you shouldn't put urself in a category. if u do, you'll end up buying clothes that u think emo's should wear instead of what u actually like.. emo clothes are supposed to be tight and that doesn't flatter overweight ppl, though, so that's why u might want to not be specifically emo. u can have a cool emo-ish style that still flatters you. just look around in stores and buy whatever you like. you'll end up loving how you look, and you won't be called a poser by other emo's because you'll be being urself. if you end up looking emo then fine, ur emo.     -for example get a style of shirt or pants that flatters girls your size but bbuy them in cool colors or patterns that are your style. try looking in magazines or online to find what style clothes you should wear.    so, just wear whatever you like, don't worry about fitting into a category. u might never find a specific store to always shop in; my advice is to just go on a big shopping trip and go everywhere, check out everything. you never know what you'll find in the mall-- there's lots of stuff you'd never know was there if u don't look!  PS: don't feel pressured to act a certain way just because u want to be emo, too. if it isn't you, it isn't you. most ppl have made emo's into a stereotype, and nobody's a stereotype imo! [well, almost everybody.]    here are a couple websites for finding styles that will flatter ur body... idk if they will help but here they are-->    http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...

H3PcFertaa	What do you mean by 'younger' ?  If you are just talking a couple of years, you may end switching around again and liking it. You could just be going through that time period of 1st adulthood, where anything that you did the year or two before you want to distance yourself from because you are now 'adult'.  You need to relax and look at this in an adult manner. Be objective, and try to view your tattoo from 10 yrs in the future.  As to what you should do,... you either add to it to make it something that you love again. Or if it is just poorly done, then you find an excellent   tattoo artist to make it into the best Tinkerbell tattoo ever.  Or you do a tattoo cover up (not makeup, a new tattoo). which would indeed need to be bigger. But before you run from that idea, look at these:  http://www.millercotton.com/Miller.html  http://misha-art.com/tattoos/tattoosmain...  You can end up with some beautiful and quality tattoos that are creative and unique. I especially like the transition of the flower tattoo. That is beautiful work, and completely successful.  And another idea which could really be a creative endeavor, would be to think of images that appeal to you now, and subjects that you want to pursue in the future etc. and with that excellent tattoo artist that you should find, get a sleeve. Could be cool.  Otherwise, laser is about $250 a session, and you would need several very painful sessions, that would leave you with a slight image and a scar. I doubt that that is the best answer.  Find a good tattooist and have a consultation, and open your mind to new possibilities.  good luck~|`|HLmd17r9aa	Maybe you could put a quote around it that means something to you or add something beside it like the symbol of your astrological sign. I am sure if you let your artist know that you are ready for a change they will be able to suggest some great ideas. Sorry I couldn't be of more help!|`|5wDjXzSraa	To console you, you should know that not all tattoos have to "mean something". I've gotten tattoos just because I wanted it, and I thought what my artist came up with was pretty.     How about adding some color, and a wash/spray of "pixie dust" and a few tiny stars behind it?    I love Tinkerbell. And if you loved her once too, try to improve what you have. Don't cover it or have it lasered off.|`|a5BhsLeQaa	Maybe you could try Wrecking Balm. They claim to fade out tattoos. here's the website.    http://www.wreckingbalm.com/|`|jjPtdlA6aa	You should get sparkles around her and put your name or someone important to you name under tinkerbell.|`|a3dff296d70d40f4d3340b36dcdadd84aa	Your not gonna get an answer you like, or one that's helpful for that matter.

Very long, expensive, and painful process though. You should really look into it, it works very well.|`|8THz1sp9aa	You can get it removed. But it's very pricey and painful.     I would just go to your artist and get a cover-up.|`|MxdOSmKUaa	You can get it removed.|`|N19mmDELaa	i would just get it covered up. if you find the right thing to cover it up, it doesn't have to be much bigger than it already is. you can make it really pretty :)|`|LvI4jRd8aa	just get it removed
pVU8Rzjcaa	Both made me red and blotchy. I don't think proactive works at all. I got worse and stayed that way until I tried some other stuff.
3lnTOyWsaa	i have two birthmarks one on my stomach above my belly button that's darker than my natural skin tone and one on my back that's lighter. I think they're cute and make me unique. I don't know a lot of other people with a mole and birthmark on their stomach and a freckle right next to their belly button (It's cuter than it sounds.) I say keep it. I'm not sure if it would do the same thing but I had a mole on my back removed (the doctor thought it might be cancer (it wasn't )) it's been a year and i still have a little dip in by back from where it was removed.|`|ab2f66e8a13e1ac5cc285faefb061f12aa	No - I too have a Birthmark that used to be embarrassing (it looks like a hickey) It has only been a problem in Middle and High School after that no one much cared and it is not an issue at all anymore. Bottom line surgery is a huge"fix" for a 3-4year inconvenience. Just remember it is part of you a "signature look" if you will and anyone who thinks otherwise can pound sand. Don't change your look for any but yourself. Good Luck!|`|eW3yAgdpaa	well its really up to you...you seriously are unique and god made you that way...it doesnt matter what others think...if it bothers you that much you should take it away but try to grow into it and accept the fact that you have it!|`|7MZCYED3aa	i think you should leave it. my friend got her birthmark taken off, and it left a scar like... twice the size it was. it looks really gross, so i wouldnt' recommend getting it removed.    and just like you said, it makes you unique(: if people dont like you bc u have a birthmark, then they aren't worth it.   hope this helped!|`|04bE2hsZaa	I have a birthmark too, on my lower back that is.  I highly dislike it and my doctor said  can remove it, but it'll live a bigger and uglier scar. Plus, you can't really, walk around or play around especially the first few weeks. I would advise you not to take it out. I mean, it's god gifted. And you, or we should be happy and proud of our god-gifted mark.
zY8uu241aa	Well, maybe.  Along with the skin on your scalp.  I'd just get it bleached if I wanted white hair; safer and probably less harmful to your hair.|`|AA11785060	Sounds like a really easy way to get seriously burned.  Don't mess with really hot oil.  I'd think it would damage instead of help it.|`|yo30g3pPaa	its actually really good for your hair. I don't know about the color thing, but I know that he helps your hair be more healthy and shiny.|`|UDgX4m41aa	I've done oil treatments before and it hasn't stripped my color..  Hot oil treatments that you can get at beauty supply stores work really well on my hair, it might depend on what type of hair you have though.
9rQzQxexaa	wear dark brown tights, tan boots, and a white or light beige shirt.  boots can be worn in the spring, but without the tights and long sleeve shirt. it will only look weird with boots if its ridiculously hot outside and you wear boots. wear it on the chillier spring days. in winter fall, wear it anytime|`|0JcJedLcaa	it would help to see a pic to no what color brown and stuff.  buttt  for the shirt. white or grey, probably is best.   tights. grey  boots: brown maybe.    are u talking ugg boots?        uhm i also think if its the right color brown(idk about  this its hard to picture in my head)  but like a LIGHT pink shirt and same color boots. and then grey leggings.      i definitely think grey tights either wayy      and u can wear boots anytime but summer it would start to look wierd i think.|`|WCYEHwEIaa	Always stay within the color family when in doubt.  Brown boots. Cream or ivory long sleeve shirt. you might be able to wear a pale pink though. But stay in pale colors. and wear matching brown tights.|`|TrKxV5a8aa	okay i would do the same and stay in the colors that match  for winter like wear a light brown long sleeve and maybe white tights or black (matches with anything) then where like some light brown boots?? ;D  also when it comes to spring time dont wear tights and the boots it doesnt have to be exactly just beause season because all year long it gets cold. but i'd actually consider not wearing tights nor boots and just go with the flats & no long sleeve shirt.......maybe just maybe a short sleeve;D  ** hope i've helped**|`|EV8vgMMxaa	boots can be all year round :)    and a nice cream or white long sleeve works well on this brown  heres an example of the white below:  http://www.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid...    happy findings!

The pain isn't that bad - it only lasts a second , then most salons use a cooling/soothing gel.    I think the most popular style is the Brazilian, as you have the smoothness of bare skin, and then the small strip so you don't feel too naked.    For an idea of styles have a look at what my local salon offers (salon is based in uk - so names for styles could be slightly different)    BIKINI LINE (outside knicker line)  HIGH BIKINI (high sides and top of pubic triangle)  TRUE BRAZILIAN (all off except landing strip)  PLAYBOY BIKINI (all off except pencil thin strip)  HOLLYWOOD BIKINI (all off)  LAS VEGAS BIKINI (all off with bikini gems)    Have fun!

hUZc273laa	The best solution is probably to email them and ask there will be a contact us section on their website. Usually in shops if you return an item that you bought using a gift card you can return the items but they give you store credit.|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	If it is purchased on the gift card it will be credited back onto the gift card.|`|WCYEHwEIaa	It would be treated the same as if you had used a debit or credit card, and will go back to your card.

Bad idea getting your friend to do it.|`|HE1cJJQYaa	before i even read what you wrote i thought...oh god another one of these. havent you read enough self/friend piercing questions to know that its not something you should do?     why are you asking us? you are going to do what you are going to do and you just want support in your decision even if it has to be from complete strangers. i'm sorry if this sounds harsh. i just dont understand why people don't listen. but if you are actually taking our opinions into consideration and decide that it is a potentially dangerous act and are not going to go through with it then i apologize for ranting on you.    i say dont do it.|`|4d3Md9pnaa	Hell no.  Unless you go to a piercing parlor with a PROFESSIONALS, don't do it.    Your friend doesn't have the right knowledge to pierce you.  And chances are, she doesn't even have the right tools.  No, a heated up safety pin is not the right tool.    edit: she still shouldn't pierce you.  having the right tools doesn't mean the right knowledge of how to pierce you. it's not as simple as putting a needle through your skin.  even if she has pierced others previously, it's still not a good idea.  and your mom will kill you. just wait until you're 18.|`|jPJaSIXPaa	well yes.but it would be tough to keep it from your momma|`|vhXbGB8naa	Don't do it, if you still want it at 18 get it done professionally and it's a lot safer.|`|v5J50Ep2aa	PROFESSIONAL.... i made a stupid mistake i didn't get it done in a sterile environment and it got badly infected.|`|8c6e2a73151cc65046309f9d3e2dc2d7aa	PLEASE DONT LET YOUR FRIEND DO IT.

Its simple, but classy- playful, but not cheap looking. Its big enough for all the necessities, and a little bit more for those filled days, but small enough to carry every day     and the cream color would make a nice contrast with the black that you wear, it makes it look really professional.|`|d5t5XgfVaa	ohh i love it. you shold get it. aha i want it|`|c7fXzcdwaa	its kinda boring. get something fun and brightt|`|I1tnVvVGaa	love it!!|`|I322HOe7aa	It`s a good deal.And it`s a reaaaally cute bag!(:|`|1JhBe6STaa	I don't like it.

ih1ruMENaa	The best method for hiding pores is to apply a primer and then foundation. The primer fills in any open pores or dimpling, so that the subsequent foundation goes on smoothly and does not aggregate in the hollows. It also prevents breakouts by creating a barrier between the skin and makeup.    The best primer brand of the moment (it won the Allure Best of Beauty award) is the Smashbox Photo Finish Light Foundation Primer, which retails for $36. As for foundation, anything oil-free will work best. If you want something inexpensive, try Maybelline Pure Makeup, which is made up of 50% water, and only costs $10.    Skin is usually porey when it's either a) very oily naturally or b) frequently clogged with oily makeup. This is because they expand to let moisture out. If you cleanse regularly or stop wearing oil-based products you may be able to resolve the problem completely.|`|ABOvm38Caa	Avon makes a product called Magix Face Perfector.  It helps control shine as well as smooth lines and imperfections on your face.  You can wear it alone or underneath your foundation.  Works pretty good.  My sister sells avon.  You can buy it for $10 or sometimes it is in sale for $7.99.  www.youravon.com/mrinehimer|`|AA11675226	Maybe ask your sister for some skin-care and make-up tips?    The best make-up in the world still wont cover bad skin, so make sure your daily routine includes a cleanser, toner and moisturiser.    I have combination skin, with occasional breakouts and use a tea tree oil based cleanser in the shower, then a witch-hazel toner and light moisturiser with SPF 15+.     If I want super special make-up, I use a foundation primer before applying foundation and it keeps my look smooth and pretty all day long.|`|2d09f93de46a0dc009145e07042f45f5aa	Look for a moisturizer or primer that will give you a matte look.  there's also products (both drugstore and department store brands) that also help reduce the look for pores.  using a good moisturizer/primer, some foundation, and finish off with a setting powder will definitely make your skin look smooth.  good luck!|`|E3qca0pTaa	maybelline has come out with a new foundation that's supposed to make your skin look "100%" pore less. when i saw it i was like whaaaaaat!!!???  hahaha im going to try it for sure. its supposed to sit on top of your skin instead of sinking into pores, which is what happens with most foundations. its a liquid mousse sooo its supposed to be very light :]      http://www.maybelline.com/Product/Face/F...      hope i helped :D

Or perhaps you could take the dress to a tailor (which you will most likely have to do anyway) and have them make you sleeves or a little jacket in the same material?  Just an idea.

AA11675226	Not sure where you can get this done locally as I live in Australia however I would recommend going to a parlour that has been recommended online or through a friend.    Back-yard or DIY piercings usually end in grief (scarring, nerve damage, infection etc.).     As far as the pain scale, I have had my middle lower lip pierced twice, I barely felt a thing and it was super quick as it was done by a professional.     It hurt less than a lobe piercing, more than my nose piercing and more than my ear cartilage piercing. I just breathed in when the guy told me to and before I knew it, it was over!    As for after-care, my guy recommends not wearing make-up or smoking during the healing period, which can last a few weeks. If you must smoke, try to do it out the corner of your mouth and rinse with an alcohol based mouthwash like Listerine afterwards.     Try and gargle with a mix of hot water and iodised rock salt (wait for it to cool before using), as this will keep the area clean and free from infection.|`|NLx9UiDGaa	well, tongue piercing is a lot like piercing ur ear .  You will go into the shop and you should be quickly greeted in a friendly fashion, they will check your ID and you will fill out a form. Once you tell them what you would like pierced they should have a separate, closed off room that the piercing will be done in. When you are there, look around: Is it clean, neat and tidy? Because it should be. Any signs of blood, dirt, or anything unusual you can question this or leave.    Once you are seated and as comfortable as possible, you will have your lip cleaned and wiped down to remove make up and oils. Then you will rinse the inside of your mouth with a mouthwash they give you (While this goes on, they will explain the general procedure and give you a break down of what's going on) You should be allowed to mark a spot on your lip where you would like the piercing. You should watch the piercer to make sure they change gloves when needed and be sure they show you all equipment and jewelry in its clean and sterile unopened packaging before they get started.    So with the dot on your lip, they will place a clamp on the area and as they go along, they will explain what they are doing and you are welcome to ask any questions you have while they do it. The piercer will also look for large veins and take care in not hitting them. The piercing is done form the inside out in most cases. Once the clamp is in place, the piercer will ask you to take a deep breath in and on the exhale, then they pierce. Closing your eyes often makes it easier. Generally, you will feel a sting and most people's eyes will water a bit. Most piercer will pierce from the inside of the nostril out. Once the needle is in, you can open your eyes and they will insert the jewelry (jewelry is commonly a 14g CBR or a labret stud, depending on exact location/placement of the piercing). During this part, most people feel a slight tingle or sting, but this is nothing overly bad. Keep in mind everyone feels pain different, I didn't think it hurt that bad, but just remember it'll be over with in seconds.    Once the piercing is done, they will clean up and give you aftercare instructions and they should also provide you with an aftercare sheet. During this time, as with through out the whole procedure, they should ask you if you have any questions, if you do speak up. If you have questions or concerns once you leave, be sure to call or visit them in person. When you are done, you pay them, thank them and be sure to tip.    Keep in mind, the area will be sore the next few days and the surrounding tissue may feel hard, this is normal and will subside in about a week. You will need to take care with eating, drinking and brushing your teeth. Most of the pain comes from the general soreness afterward and from infections, so be sure to take good care of the piercing. The piercing will take 3-6 months to fully heal.    After care is as follows; twice daily wash the outside with warm water and antibacterial soap (liquid gold Dial is best). While you are washing the area use a clean but wet q-tip to remove any crust. Once you are done, pat the area dry with disposable paper towel. After that, get a cup of warm water and mix in non-iodized sea salt so the mixture tastes like tears (you can get the sea salt and most organic and whole food stores). Then use a shot glass or a saturated cotton ball to soak the area fully for 10-15 minutes. You can also use this on the inside though I'm sure you can image what it'll taste like. Do this two or three times daily. The soap will keep the area generally clean, the sea salt with reduce swelling, puss and soreness and cleans in a gentle way. For the inside of the mouth, start using a clean tooth brush immediately and after drinking and eating, rinse your mouth well with Biotene. Biotene is best because it is alcohol and saccharin free (both of those things will make healing painful and harder to do)|`|AAPJlIqxaa	My boyfriend had his lip pierced and said he could feel the skin ripping. :/ Doesn't sound too pleasant.   Also, I wasn't aloud to kiss him for eight weeks, because of infection.   His seemed to heal fine though.|`|eUEgi111aa	Do NOT get your lip pierced at Walmart. I doubt they do it anyway, but please go to a proper parlour for your lip.    I have not got my ears pierced yet, so I cannot comment on if it hurts more - but I can tell you that I am a right wimp when it comes to pain and the lip piercing didn't bother me AT ALL. I have mine done in the middle.    And it is very simple to keep the infection away if you take care of it properly. I had no problems with mine at all, not even swelling.
AA11118472	u have to wait for it to grow back orrr i heard vinegar or beer to wash d hair reverses it but it will b very very dry and brittle, but i advice dont try it
2oN7WrVKaa	Start at the tip and with a cuticle cutter, cut a STRAIGHT line on the side that hurts as close to the skin as possible, all the way down to your nailbed.  This should get it out.  I get them sometimes, but I dont need surgery.  Its an easy fix.    OR:  You can to a nail salon, and the person who does your feet will remove it for you!  They fixed mine.  :)|`|oxWpo4bqaa	You should probably get it checked out if its been hurting that long.|`|RRsewhcFaa	soak your foot in warm water for a while like 30 minutes for a few days and see if it loosens.|`|PQBEqS8Caa	I had the same prob. U have to get surgery. Who told u that they r gonna take the whole nail off? They will only cut out whats inside. It will be nuthin. I had it done also.

And trust me, the pain oly gets worse when u leave it.|`|DeUvhuuQaa	my friend had that and had surgery for it lol    see a doc|`|kxcpAL1Taa	go to the doctor and ask a professional for advice. even if they recommend surgery that doesnt mean you HAVE to get it done, but they also might be able to give you something for the pain or something|`|x7Dq90Xxaa	i had one befour... i thought it would never go away! but eventually i stoped picking at it, delt with the pain, and after about a week or a week and a half it went away! hope this helps :)

(ex casual, dressy) Never just match your clothes like green pants and a green jacket unless your wearing different shades or something. Find colors and styles that go together and don't clash with anything like your hair color or whatever. Honestly also I think Uggs and crocks are the ugliest shoes on earth and babydoll dresses make people look pregnant. And the new neon tights thing and shorts is pretty bad. Tights and a skirt are cute though.|`|oPKIjSdJaa	Well....... Here's what you do. Pick a whole binch of colors. some you like some you don't really like and a little bit of both.
