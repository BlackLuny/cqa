20090225080258AAwiq8i	Pets;Birds	My lovebirds hate me! Can they be tamed?	I got a pair of lovebirds from my uncle-in-law. He bought them because he thought his existing parakeet might be lonely, but they didn't get on well together so I got them. I'm usually pretty good with animals, and I thought the best way to win their trust was to let them settle down and only go near them when they're relaxed, but its been months now and they jump straight into their nest box the minute I go near their cage. Should I keep trying or just leave them as they are, I just don't want them to be afraid of me.

I called two animal hospitals. They told me as long as she eats & acts normal she should be fine. But I am still worried.    She looks fine now. She is very playful & does not look like she has abdominal discomfort.   She must have eaten it between 9 to 10am & it is 4:30pm now.    Is it possible that some happen to her later on?   Has anyone had similar experience? Please help me. Thanks.

20061229015526AAh1tGi	Pets;Cats	Devo me livrar de meu gato???	Recentemente tenho observado que meu gato n?o é aquela criaturinha fofa das quais se fala tanto.      Por exemplo, vocês já viram eles se divertindo com ratos? é de causar nojo e revolta. é chocante. Gatos s?o as criaturas mais brutais da Terra:      1) Eles arrancam com mordidas uma ou duas pernas dos ratos para torna-los mais lentos.   2) Eles os arremessam para cima para depois pular neles.   3) Eles arrancam com mordidas a cauda do rato.   4) Quando ficam cansados de se divertir massacrando o animal indefeso, deixam o rato semi-morto sofrendo por horas.   5) Finalmente, eles arrancam sua cabe?a com uma mordida.   6) Eles arremessam as tripas do bicho pelo ar. Eles deixam peda?os de rato por todo lugar.   7) Eles deixam peda?os de ratos por todo lugar e minha casa parece cenário de filme de terror.      Eles fazem o mesmo com outros animais como pássaros, lagartixas, baratas, etc.      Mas o pior de tudo é ve-los vomitar partes de passaros ou ratos semi-digeridos.

20061201182831AAcmXIl	Pets;Birds	2 de Dezembro?	Ele é a rocha, cuja obra é perfeita,       porque todos os Seus caminhos justos s?o.       - Deuteronómio 32:4            Quando eu era treinador da equipa feminina de basquetebol na universidade, no outono de 2005, fiquei surpreendido por ouvir tantas vezes: "Isso n?o é justo!".   A motiva??o das raparigas parecia estar dependente do facto de elas acharem ser justo ou n?o aquilo que eu lhes pedia para fazerem. Se eu dissesse a algumas alunas para praticarem a defesa enquanto outras faziam lan?amentos livres, eu ouvia: "N?o é justo." Se eu deixasse que um grupo jogasse ao ataque mais tempo do que outro, eu ouvia: "N?o é justo."   Tantas situa??es na vida reclamam: "N?o é justo!". Eu vejo casais Crist?os que lutam para terem um bebé enquanto outros s?o aben?oados com filhos e tratam-nos mal. Eu olho para as famílias cujos filhos est?o bem, enquanto que eu avan?o na vida sem ter um filho meu. Eu vejo amigos que anseiam por servir Deus mas n?o podem por motivos de saúde.   é aí ent?o que eu tenho de ir rebuscar uma verdade fundamental. N?o somos nós que definimos o que é justo ou n?o. é Deus, e Ele sabe muito mais acerca dos Seus planos e propósitos. A quest?o n?o se trata do que é justo ou n?o. Afinal, trata-se de confian?a num Deus fiel que sabe o que está a fazer. "Ele é a rocha, cuja obra é perfeita, porque todos os seus caminhos justos s?o" (Deut. 32:4).   A vida nunca irá parecer justa. Mas quando confiamos em Deus, nós sabemos que Ele é sempre fiel. - JDB                  A VIDA NEM SEMPRE é JUSTA,       MAS DEUS é SEMPRE FIEL.

She barks & "humps" the chocolate one when someone comes in the door, or when the younger one's getting attention & also at random times.  I know this is a dominance behavior, but it's a problem at times. She has never hurt my other dog bc the younger one immediately submits.      the problem is that she has snapped at my boyfriend's dogs (he has a chocolate lab & a small black mutt), actually hurting them a little.  she will stop when i yell at her, but i'm concerned that she'll hurt one of his dogs & it'll happen to fast for us to be able to stop it.

That is only a last resort for her.  This dog belongs to her two young children who lost everything but the dog in a fire.  So getting rid of him would devastate them.

Ya habia adoptado antes pero por desgracia mi perrita murio de moquillo.   Muchas veces cuando uno adopta es riesgoso por que no sabes si pueden contraer una enfermedad,pero para mi es mejor salvarle la vida a un animalito y darle un hogar.Espero que el cachorrito que adoptamos la libre y dure muchos a?os con nosotros.   Ademas adopte 2 gatos anteriormente,bueno de hecho los recogi de la calle y son muy buenos gatitos.No me arrepiento de adoptar.

My shitzu  was fine until today, in the mornings he usually runs to his food and eats half of his serving and then the other half in the afternoon, however this morning he didn't do that and instead he threw up this nasty bright yellow fluid.  He has eaten but because I have had to feed him by hand.  Is this just a normal tummy ache or could it be serious ?  Im so worried.  I was given this dog by a breeder and what I noticed is that all her other dogs seemed to very happy dogs and mine was terrified of everything, she said he loved to play outside and that is totally not true, he hates going outside and when she gave him to me he had ticks, while her other dogs were super clean. It makes me wonder how much this dog was loved by the previous owner. I've had him for a little over a week and he's so happy now, he's not afraid anymore, but now im worried he might be getting sick.

20070704221223AAMu6ms	Pets;Dogs	My new puppy becomes shy after his vaccination?	I just adopted a 12-week old puppy. He wasn't shy at all when we picked him up, and he adjusted well at our home. He allowed my neighbors to pet him, and even wag his tail and responded to their call. No whines, reasonable potty, and responded well to us. The fist 24 hour was quite easy. So we were quite confident that he was an outgoing puppy. Then on the second day we brought him to the vet to have his second vaccination, and right on that day, we brought him out to a somewhat crowded shopping area near our home. He started to shiver a little and became shy to people. He started to avoid people's hands that are reaching out to pet him. He was still like that til today (his 3rd day). He would respond to people, but it was obvious that he was very cautious. He seems to be extra careful for everything. He didn't want to walk in a place he didn't feel confident about. And he was still suspicious to people who wanted to pet him. Is this temporary? Will he become traumatized forever?

20070808162844AAJn3wL	Pets;Dogs	Getting 2nd dog? Good idea or bad?	hi, i adpoted a 5 year old desexed male ridgeback about 3 months ago, the family who owned him, had him and another dog at the time. They got along really well. At the moment he is the only dog we own. I have been taking him to obedience training and he is generally good around other dogs and wants to play with them. I cant help but feel mean for letting him live alone - with that being said he is not neglected - we go for a drive to the beach every Friday and have lunch together - he goes for a swim and then we go for a long walk along the sand together. He goes to obedience school 2 times a week and also enjoys lots of car rides. He is an inside dog and has his own bed in my room. So i know he has human company. My other reason for thinking about getting a secend dog (a female puppy) is that i am really enjoying this whole obedience thing and would like to consider competitive obedience. i know i could go further with a dog trained at a young age. I wouldnt love either any less.

20070819093419AA1mJM7	Pets;Dogs	What do you think life looks like from your dog's perspective?	Sometimes my dog does things like "guard" when I run into someone on a walk and start talking (what he does is sit up behind me facing away from me, as if watching my back. He also will start racing around the house randomly. He also looks at me like he is trying to understand what I'm doing sometimes. What do you think he thinks he's doing? What does he think I'm doing when I'm watching tv, talking on the phone, going out, or working on the computer? I think my dog probably thinks I'm nuts and he's taking care of me.
20070820192435AALuKyo	Pets;Dogs	A red bump on my dog's butt?	my 4yr old chocolate lab came home from boarding today because we were on vacation and i noticed a red bump on his butt,...(everytime he comes back from boarding he has something wrong with him), anyways we took him back to the vet and they said that it was fine and just to leave it alone because there was nothing wrong with it. They said my dog was probably dragging his butt on the concrete which he never does so i doubt thats what it's from, but they said that he had trouble pooping earlier that day. My dog licks at it constantly and I've noticed that it's starting to puss. Does anyone know what it is? or what i can do?

20070904191746AAtzV7r	Pets;Dogs	Mixed up puppy, how do I make her understand?	I have a puppy that is 5 months old. She can be outside all day and when we let her in at night she will poo in front of the door within the first 15-20 minutes after bringing her in. And we have the same problem in the middle of the night. Or we can have her inside with us all day letting her out every ? hour without any problems. (I work, so being inside all day is not an option.)      She is a very verbal and demanding pup, crying loudly when she wants something and refuses to give it a rest, no matter how much you say no or ignore her demands.         She is very intelligent, she knows how to sit shake hands with both paws, lay down, speak and stand up and walk on her hind legs. With all of this intelligence, why can't we get her to understand she must potty outside?      I have tried the reward technique but she still will not ask to go outside and poo's at the entrance way.      Why is she doing this and how do we get her to stop?

20090225135200AACdrXk	Pets;Dogs	My 2 year old Pit snapped at someone, NEVER before.?	I don't want to blame this on him being a Pit. I never would. I love Pits and have major experience with them through my line of work. My dog is about 3 years old. He is as sweet as can be. Never makes a sound or a mess. Never been an issue, ever.  I took him to the vet today with his little brother who is a border terrier. He is always wicked stressed out there, and any other weird place. A woman came in with a snarling little rat terrier who was working up my dog, incessantly barking at my dogs, showing his teeth. My dog was of course barking back and getting more worked up and stressed out. Instead of sitting away from us, this woman decides its a good time to come up behind my dogs and pet the little one. Axl, my Pit doesnt noticed her because he is focused fully on her little yapping dog, and gets startled and snaps at this stranger who knows nothing about me or my dogs, but is pretty much in his face. He did not get her. Afterwards I kept apologizing and insisting he has never done it before. I feel like she was trying to blame the fact that he is a pit for this. She said to not worry, but made me feel terrible and told the vet staff "he bites". How should I feel about this? I have been anxious because of it all day. I wouldnt ever lose trust in my dog. He is a great guy.

She weighs 11.1 pounds and her stomach seems like it is in danger of dragging on the ground because it is so big. She's been on a diet for about a month now of 3/8 a cup a day. I think she lost weight in the beginning, because she looks a little smaller, but she hasn't lost any weight since last week (the first time I weighed her with a legit scale.)      What can I do to help her loose weight? How much should I be feeding her?      Don't tell me to feed her the amount recommended on the package. They recommend those amounts because they'll sell more if cats eat more. She would be absolutely obese if she ate that much.

Hace 14 dias adoptamos un pastor aleman/mix de  6 meses de un refugio de animales,resulta que el perro es muy sano y bien parecido,pero realmente siento que como que el perro no va con mi personalidad,el es un perro joven asi que es extremadamente activo y no puedo jugar con el todo el dia y me siento culpable,yo se que un animalito no es un juguete que se regresa a la tienda por que no nos gusto,pero yo quisiera mejor devolverlo y que alguna otra familia con ni?os lo adoptara.Me duele mucho y me siento muy mal pero no quisiera que solo por quedarnolo el perro no tenga las atenciones que necesite.Yo queria mucho un perro pero tu sabes que cuando estas dispuesto adoptar lo buscas y cuando de verdad encuentras a uno que roba tu corazon,pero en mi caso "lola" no robo mi corazon,fue desicion de mi marido.Es dificil entrenar un perro que biene con muchos malos habitos.Por eso yo  hubiera preferido adoptar un cachorrito y educarlo como yo quisiera.

Por isso estou postando aqui para saber a opini?o de vcs . . .       Ai vai um peda?inho:      Em agosto de 1995, o pesquisador Derrel Sims levou ao Dr. Leir duas pessoas supostamente seqüestradas por seres extraterrestres e que apresentavam indícios de possuirem implantes introduzidos em seus corpos.      Esses implantes foram cirurgicamente removidos imediatamente pelo Dr. Leir. Os resultados iniciais apresentados podem ser a evidência que faltava para provar que o seqüestro de humanos por alienígenas s?o uma realidade e n?o fic??o.      O Dr. Leir removeu três objetos implantados, sendo dois deles tirados de um único paciente. O terceiro objeto foi removido da parte superior da m?o esquerda do segundo paciente. Estas pessoas n?o tinham o conhecimento de que possuiam esses implantes em seus corpos. Ambos os pacientes souberam dos objetos através de radiografias tiradas com outros objetivos.      Até aquele momento nenhum dos pacientes havia reclamado de dores nos locais de implante. Outro fator interessante é a inexistência de marcas de incis?o para a coloca??o dos implantes.      Lá no site tem fotos e a filmagem da cirurgia . . .    http://www.gnosisonline.org/Ufognose/imp...       E aii o que acharam? Verdade ou Mentira???
