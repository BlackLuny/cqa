IH6Wlmqsaa	Bring the remote inside over night and see if that works, the low temps might be messing with it. Good Luck!|`|jWtquDVUaa	Try using lithium batteries, they are more reliable in colder temps.|`|hcc8fq7jaa	You didn't give enough info to diagnose it, so here are some common issues: If the wall switch works, but the remotes don't, they may have been locked out on the wall panel. If you need to hold the wall button in in order to close the door, the safety sensors are misaligned. If the unit doesn't move at all, and it's a screw-drive, you need to spray lubricant along the entire length of the screw, disengage the door, then push the button and let the screw turn by itself for a minute or so. Cold weather causes them to bind up. Beyond that, the force settings on the opener sometimes need to be increased in cold weather, as everything gets "stiffer" in the cold. More info would help.|`|fa591e1d6822b29b7faa78351da9d77daa	Others have it about right. Bring remotes inside to warm up. If they still do not work (and after at least one new battery, trade the one battery between remotes) but your wall button does (And I really mean your remotes are dead and your wall button works EVERY time) you probably have what is called an intermittent radio problem.  Occasionally electronics will get heat or cold sensitive and do strange things. I just need to know what make and model of opener and how old it is? I usually do not see this in modern controls, just in old tube radios and really old solid state sets. The last time I saw this in a modern set was 14 years ago.
LU6vfqRzaa	Look at any of the Polaris products.  They come in several different types of pool cleaners and price range.      Google:    Reviews and prices on automatic pool cleaners.        :-)|`|Sxlcyua5aa	The best pool cleaners in my opinion run off of a separate motor like some Polaris models, which means that you would have to have someone to dig under your current walk way that is around your pool to install an outlet into the side of your pool to hook the vacuum up too.   The self contained models which have filter bags in them are a pain to clean.   Believe me, I used them and after the first use, they don't work that well after wards (my opinion).  The filter bags are just a pain to wash.  I would suggest a polaris that hooks into your filter which you said that you do not want.   They make an attachment now which will collect debris that is on the surface.   That is the one that I use now and like.   I do have to replace the internal parts every two years.   But I just buy the kit instead of buying a new one which costs around $170.   To me the price is worth it as compared to vacuuming the pool by hand.   Good luck.
jW8nfcA6aa	1. The first blowing is the Purge Phase.The furnace does that to clear the combustion chamber of any accumulated gas to prevent explosions.2.&3. The Igniter is energized and comes to temperature in the  clear and safe chamber. ( yours ain't energizing). 4.&5.Gas is emitted into the chamber normally,but if the thermal-couple doesn't detect the proper heat at the igniter it signals the control valve to shut down gas flow to prevent explosive conditions.If you smell a little gas maybe your cont.vlv.is a little slow on the shut-off step.I don,t know.

lwMmZY4Xaa	They make a sound dampening drywall you can use on the ceiling. Depending on your budget a radiant heat flooring system would be ideal.|`|V8GrFx0jaa	Try a floating floor such as Dri Core - you can find it at Lowe's and Home Depot. It has worked great for us, keeps our carpet off the concrete and sits above the concrete (it has little plastic feet) in case of water seepage.    For soundproofing, look into Suppress board. It costs alot more than regular drywall, but if it is only for the ceiling it may be worth the extra expense. That and using a high R-value insulation will also help form a sound barrier.|`|l1dAq3pOaa	If you are going to use tile, slate, etc., put down heat tapes with a thermostat then you can set the temp at whatever you want.

e63052db9e9b25c99b677c003ed25e28aa	If you are not remodelling your kitchen, replacing with another drop-in is the best bet.  Your biggest concern would deal with the space between the existing cabinets and the counter top.  With a slide-in range there is no counter top at all - the unit simply fits between two cabinets (ideally with finished ends) with flush counter edges.  With a drop-in, you usually have a cabinet "box" and a counter top with a cut-out to allow the unit to fit into.  If you are able to remove part of the existing counter and cabinet box that supports the existing range without damaging the adjoining cabinets and counter, (and assuming you have enough space), you should be able to get a slide-in.  Be aware that it will involve more work.  Also, remember that when replacing a range it is important that you are sticking with the same energy source (gas to gas or electric to electric) - unless, of course, you have the ability to change that in a full or partial remodel.

t2M1kXY4aa	Any laundromat I've been to does, indeed have a change machine.  But sometimes it's empty or broken, so if you can take your own quarters you'll know that won't be an issue.    Nobody cares how you bring your laundry in ... laundry baskets, trash bags, duffel bags ... whatever's most convenient for you.  I've seen people bringing in several full clothes hampers at once.    Some places have a policy that you are to stay there until your laundry is done ... others don't.  If a laundromat is very busy and there tends to be a backup waiting for the machines, it's most polite to stay so that you are able to get your stuff in, done, and out as quickly as possible.    Often there are only one or two of the supersize triple-loader washing machines ... these are often in demand ... so if you DO use one of those machines, please DO make sure you're there when the machine finishes so that the person waiting for it can use it.    It's generally considered rude to remove another person's laundry from a washer or dryer, even if the machine is finished, the person is nowhere to be found, and you're waiting for an open machine.  If you absolutely MUST, there are usually carts available, but unless the place is extremely busy and you absolutely cannot wait, try not to do that.    Take your own laundry supplies (detergent, fabric softener, etc.) if you can.  You can buy them there, but it's expensive.    There will be labels on each machine with instructions for how to use it.  The washers usually have a one-minute wait-time from when the machine shuts off until the door will open.  That's for safety reasons, to ensure that the insides of the machine have completely stopped moving.    |`|AA10520442	I would stay there til the laundry is done.  While it hasn't happened to me I have heard stories about people pilfering other's clothing.  I have also heard stories of people with odd fetishes taking lingerie.

Most places don't have change machines, get some rolls of quarters from your bank.  2. You can bring your laundry in a wheelbarrow if you want, it doesn't matter.  3. Waiting isn't required, but it's advisable if you have a lot of name-brand or expensive clothes.  If the laundromat door doesn't lock, STAY.  Take your homework or a good book to read.    Also, make sure you check the lint screen on the dryer before you use it, and check the washer and dryer thoroughly before using them for gross stuff that might have been left behind.|`|DzCvWvr3aa	no 1....MOST of them have change machines....try to have nice crisp dollar bills for them.....no 2..nobody cares HOW you carry your laundry!!    ...no 3....you can stay there if you want...read a book or watch it go round and round!!......or leave and come back later..it is all up to you......but take a bunch of change...just in case!!    oh yes...take your own SOAP!!!|`|1d5d8bccd65f8dda49977dd81c81f96faa	1----yes they have change makers    2---yes    3---yes, you have to remove the laundry from the washing machine when done in case someone else is waiting for a washer, same goes for the dryer.

Usually you add 1/3  of your detergent in the pre-soak cycle, then add the rest in the wash cycle, but check the directions.  Ask the attendant if you're not clear on it.|`|9a9bc3fcd75b9c1aaf0f67c0fead9c6caa	Some have attendants on duty and will give you change others have change machines    Take it in whatever    I would wait til they're done for the simple reason...People have a tendency to take what is not theirs.

j96MmjhTaa	I have a Dyson DC20 - the cute foldable one, and this is the best cleaning tool ever! I live in a rented accomodation and was using the hoover provided by my landlord until finally I got fed up with hoovering on my knees and got my own shiny Dyson. The carpets looked as if they were professionally cleaned. You will not believe how much dust is in them until you Dyson them. It will also help you with your allergy, if you have one. Dyson also cleans the pet hair (and my own hair) efficiently.    Even the old Dyson (cant remember the number - upright lumpy DC14 or something) is brilliant.     The 5-year guarantee is hassle free (I burnt the engine in the old one when I was vacuuming up loads of plaster dust - and they do tell you not to do it). They came over, replaced the engine and that was it!    Plus you will get loads of onboard tools that will let you get into every nook and cranny,    I doubt there are any cheaper hoovers that do the job as good as Dyson does. Besides, what you spend on the Dyson, you will save because it will take less time to dyson the house, less electricity and you will grow to love it. I never heard anyone complaining about a dyson,    James Dyson is a genius - ever used his hand-drier? Mindblowing.    Go and get it, mate!    Hal.

gFHTcIc8aa	There are many types of weeds that cannot be killed by Weed-B-Gone.    DO NOT USE REGULAR ROUND-UP (Glypophosphate) IN YOUR LAWN.  YOU WILL KILL GRASS.    Spraying and digging up the entire yard is a last resort, is very time consuming, and is often not necessary.  A rule of thumb I use is if 50% or more of yard is covered with weeds, then you should consider spraying and turning entire lawn over.    Identify the weed(s) and there is a spray which can control or prevent it. Can you upload a picture?  The weed you have may be chickweed.  It is difficult to tell without more description.    Note: some species of weeds have an extensive root system and unless you remove 6" or more of soil you still may not get rid of weed problem.  Spraying with herbicide insures a complete destruction of weed, inclusive of roots.  Mechanical "digging" may not.    Also, insure you have a reliable means of watering sod daily.  You will need to do this daily until sod has become fully anchored into soil.  During periods of hot weather, a daily deep watering maybe necessary due to the fact sod requires more water than standard seeded lawn.|`|VpU4Aludaa	1-Pull all the weeds then put it down and put mulch on top of it..."all the weeds"..!!  2-Don"t forget that Your sod should be" greenness "..to fill in any large spaces between pieces of sod with soil.  3-Tha last step ...to give the "plant sod" a deep watering once a day.  Good chance.  :)  Thanks.  .|`|f3FL1knpaa	Just make sure that you use a rake and clear your garden area. You might want to till the area also. You might also have to do it the old fashioned way and get on your hands and knees to weed out the area.    I would avoid chemicals and things like that since you can remove the weeds without them. Good luck :)|`|NJULnXiyaa	When I do a sod install, I RoundUp the whole area wait 1-2 weeks and then rototill the whole area. Rototilling will also give your sod a good medium to root into.   Some folks will use a sod cutter and strip of the old grass but in my area we only have a couple of inches of top soil with hard rocky clay underneath. We can't afford to loose the only decent soil we have.    -Brian|`|HwfYEQUOaa	Roundup kills the roots and the entire weed. That's the best preplant solution to start with clean start. Lay the sod, keep it watered until the lawn is established, then back off on the water. Fertilize occasionally, at least twice a year. 3 to 5 times is better, but you'll have to mow more often.|`|AA11214026	forget chemical stuff it will stay in the ground forever and do not till that will just bring up more weed seeds  what you need to do is solorize the soil cover the entire area with plastic, weight down the edges and let thw soil cook for a few weeks
mYmR5cX5aa	The store will charge you a delivery fee if you have them deliver the furniture. The Pro side to this is that you do no have to do the work, and if they damage the furniture, you can go after the store for a replacement or repair. If you damage it, it is your baby.     Depends on your budget, strength and patience, and if you have access to a truck and good help.|`|8IANTRgDaa	That depends on the type of establishment that you buy each piece of furniture from.  Also, if they offer a delivery service & the cost of it, etc., etc.|`|n560blqraa	It depends on whether they offer manufacturer to store delivery as some don't. However, If you have a truck and guys to help, it can be the difference of getting your furniture not only quicker, but also cheaper. If you can do it, it will save money on the delivery and often give you instant gratification of your purchase if they have a warehouse that you can pick up from that day. Bare in mind, that when you choose this option to carefully inspect your products before leaving there warehouse b/c they can claim you damaged it in your travels if you discover a rip after the fact. If you damage it, getting it to your house, it's on you. If the delivery service damages your furniture it's on them!|`|TmWbXW28aa	Hi,    It all depends on size, type of furniture and cost of delivery. If it is the likes of a large sofa then the delivery option would probably be best. If it is flat pack furniture from the likes of Ikea you will need quite a large vehicle to fit in the likes of wardrobes plus they are usually extremely heavy. Also, check with the store when the furniture will be available and can be delivered. Some of the large furniture stores can take months to deliver.|`|PRx6j6YQaa	if the store offers free delivery than take it if they are charging to deliver   than do it yourself|`|Oq5a5hRhaa	For large, pre-built furniture, like sofas and high-quality tables, use the delivery. It will be difficult for you to get it home yourself.    If the item is flat-packed (meaning you put it together yourself), definitely transport it yourself. Most stores will charge a large fee to deliver flat-pack furniture for you. I know at my store, you can get a dining room set or a dresser for $200, but if you don't take it home yourself, you will pay an extra $65 for delivery.

AA10841112	You can stain a darker stain over a lighter one. But the darker stain (or any stain color) will not look as it should in color because of the existing stain that is in the wood. So if this is a concern. I would sand the old stain out. As far as the wood taking the new stain, You should be okay. Your going to have more success staining dark over light than light over dark. But like I said. Sanding out the old stain will give the new stain its true color.|`|1c4369663fe01779074249fb928cd859aa	You can stain wood that has already been stained, but if there's any type of sealant on it, like polyurethane, or a stain with a sealer, you WILL have to sand the floor a little in order to open up the "pores" of the wood. Not necessarily a total stripping.|`|KQeAx469aa	You can stain wood that has already been stained but only if it does not have any lacquer or polyurethane or any kind of clear coat on it. If it does then you need to strip it down and start over to stain it a different color.
b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	I agree with life lover 100%.  Drano is a waste of money.  And you should clean the stoppers in your drains.  But if doing that doesn't unclog your drain,  here's my two cents.  Remove the stopper by unscrewing and removing the lever at the overflow.  You'll pull out the wire and adjustment rod with it.  Just pull everything out, clean it if it's hairy and dirty, and set it aside.  If it's still clogged, it most likely is in the P-trap.  Try to plunge it.  Plug up the hole where you just pulled the stopper out with a rag or something.  The more airtight, the better.  Now many people don't know how to use a plunger effectively.  You gotta get mad, you gotta move some water.  If there's water in the tub, all the better.  It will provide more pressure.  Place the plunger over and around the drain so it creates a seal.  Now, without breaking that seal,  move the plunger up and down as hard and as fast as you can.  Get mad...Hold the rag tightly in the hole as you plunge so no air escapes.  Scream the name of a past lover who did you wrong,   or a few politicians who shall remain nameless...  You'll probably clear the sewers within a three mile radius of your house!  Kidding.  But you really have to move some water for the plunger to be effective.    If that doesn't work,  You can send a mini auger with a hand crank down the stopper hole.  Or, if the clog is in your main line,  call a rooter man to clear your lines.  He'll make sure the lines are clear of roots and such and you'll have no problems whatsoever.  Until the roots grow back...  All the best.|`|AA11215068	Whether or not Drano really works is a debate I won't get into but suffice it to say it isn't a product I purchase. The drain pipes in your home are usually 4" PVC and you'll need something well beyond Drano or Liquid Plumber if you have something blocking a 4" opening.    The problem with slow drains is typically in the bathroom sink and it's an easy fix. Once a year or so you should take out the sink stopper and the arm that actuates it up and down. You're probably going to find a lot of hair stuck to them. Turn the water on for about a minute to flush the small 1 1/4" plumbing lines and then re-install the stopper. Adjust it so the stopper is raised up on the high side for fast draining of the sink. The bath tub requires the same process.|`|6IEpZkAcaa	drano  =D|`|evItC2KQaa	The main culprit in bathtub drains is hair. There is a tool called Zip-It that is a flexible plastic wand with barbed sides that you insert in the drain and pull out slowly removing the hair. Think I got mine at Menard's.

n560blqraa	One of the most beautiful, suitable colorations would be to opt for a butternut (soft more pale shade of yellow) for a Tuscan Kitchen effect. The colors blend naturally with what you have described regarding the rooms that are juxtaposed to each other and would create a more cohesive look throughout. When you get ready to repaint your cabinets opt for a high end gloss paint like Dutchboy and be sure to primer first with KILZ. Choose and off white or bone color to achieve a more subtle effect. Remember to clean cabinets first with TSP solution wearing chemical gloves and goggles to remove nicotine before primering. Happy Painting!!|`|mYmR5cX5aa	How would a tan on the kitchen walls look ? It would go with the green and probably fit in with the slight pink on the floors. I would highly reccomend painting the kitchen cupboards using an oil base paint. It will dramatically improve the look of your kitchen as the cupboards are usually a focal point in the kitchen. They will be noticed.|`|WAktMXaVaa	Peach is a VERY good color because it's in the family called "warm colors", ALWAYS IDEAL for a kitchen.  These include shades of red, yellow, brown, etc.  Stay away from cool restful colors which belong in the bedroom or anywhere else, like greens, blues.  The warmer colors are the best cause they're inviting for food areas.|`|53nnzpBxaa	a very light butter yellow should complement the olive and blue,  to distract from the ugly cabinetes, try some wall art.  l|`|J5Y3k6Muaa	I would go with the Peach family, but a bright peach, not a dark tan peach.

Must be a long section of pipe frozen and just not under the tub.|`|cXCnszhPaa	You say you don't/can't get to the trap in the crawlspace.  Can you reach into the crawlspace?   You need to get some heat to the trap in the crawlspace, if you don't, you run the risk of splitting the trap and would have to get it replaced when everything thaws in the spring.  My suggestion is to get a small ceramic heater (electric), locate it about 18" away from the trap, and turn it on.  You may need to shape a piece of sheetmetal to act as stop on the far side of the trap to keep the heat directed towards the trap.  check often and be sure there is no combustible material in front of or in close proximity of the heater.  I kept my water heater in an unheated basement and had to do this yearly to keep the water running.|`|6O4WTiPQaa	You could try putting a little antifreeze down it after each shower to prevent this from happening in the future.

7PbJWEo1aa	We've got a standard full sized dishwasher in our new joint and its "A rated" energy and consumes 15 litres on a full cycle. Ours is 1.05kw/h which works out (minus water and finish dishwasher tablet cost) about 22p per wash.    There are two of us in my house but we wait until there are "3 meals" worth of washing up (6 place settings) so its full.    Def worth getting if its a b&b/hotel/massive family - we've had ours a week, no idea how I survived without it ;-)|`|7i6qj4OXaa	I don't know exactly how much it costs to run one but I don know that my bill went down considerably when mine broke down.  I never replaced it.|`|07402bcc6087c522e1be5f950a5e9ba8aa	You probably use about 10 gallons of water and maybe a kilowatt of electricity running through a cycle. You also need the detergent that probably goes for about 10 cents per load of dishes. Unless you have a big party that night two people can run it once a week and a full family about 3-4 times a week.    I think that is cheap (for anyone who carefully makes sure the washer is fully loaded.) Unless you like to spend hours washing and drying dishes to earn those pennies per hour you would be crazy to avoid a dishwasher. Also the 140F hot water does a better cleaning job and sanitizing than hand scrubbing.    For anyone who thinks that is too expensive they can stop using the dishwasher. The next thing to stop using is their clothes washer. They can go down to the side of a river and beat the dirt out of clothes with a rock there.
psnaJcvpaa	We are a family of 4..Tumble dryers can be very expensive to run. They are not for everyone. Tho it might be cheaper to have it on in the evening only,as during the day is more expensive.. another good tip would be to try and have one big drying session, say one or two a week as oppose to smaller ones per day.  I find that this is more affordable and keeps the cost down.|`|7PbJWEo1aa	Ours costs 28p per dry - two of us in the house, -basically one full washing load per tumble- for me its worth its weight in gold. No washing scattered over the radiators stopping the heat circulating the house etc...|`|DJLeObm4aa	I have had 2 electric tumble dryers in 36 yrs. Present one 20 yrs old come March and not 1p has been spent on any type of repair. It is a Hoover but I may just be lucky. I tumble dry all my washing, except my woolens or items that doesn't recommend tumble drying. Quite honestly I don't really feel they are OTT costly. Most people would not be like me and they would only use their tumble dryer in rainy weather or winter but what is the alternative? If you place damp items over your radiators, you are losing heat in your home, the radiator has to work much harder and therefore costing you extra money in the long run. If only 2 of you in the house I shouldn't imagine you will notice much difference in you electricity account or gas if you prefer a gas tumble dryer.

I don't think they cost to much to run, but as there are only 2 of us, I don't need to use it every day, but it's very good for sheets and towels.

XgOIlU0eaa	the electric heaters are in the indoor unit,also called the air handler if your system is a "split system"....only way the electric heaters are outside is if you have a "package" unit,meaning there is only one large unit outside that contains all of the parts that both units in a split sytem would  have.....either way,adding a third 5 kw heater isnt as easy as you think..typically you would replace the entire heat package so the new 15 kw heat package would contain not only the extra heater,but the controls for it too...also the main 240 volt wire and breaker will have to be replaced with larger ones,or an additional circuit would need to be added,,best to let hvac tech or electrician do the work,not a d-i-y thing in my opinion.........dan
AA10332086	What is your problem and what are you trying to do with the larger heat strips.     I'm not sure what you mean when you refer to a "heat pump condenser". My three heat pumps have their heat strips in the air handling unit in front of the coils that act as the evaporator in summer and the condenser in winter. Is that what you are talking about?    In any case you need to be careful putting in larger strips. You may exceed the loading on the internal circuit breakers and may also get the coils too hot with the extra heat.     How easy it is depends on the design of your air handler and how accessible it is. Since you sound like you probably haven't done anything like this before, I would say it is going to be hard.
hRrCAewyaa	You'll have to get your face down there with a flash light when the water running.  Have a towel with you when looking so you can isolate where it's coming from by wiping the drips as you search around with your eyes for the leak. If it's leaking from the source side of the faucet, maybe it's dripping even when the water isn't running so check that too.      You better get to the bottom of it sooner than later or you are going to have bigger problems on your hands like a rotted out cabinet or floor.|`|pq8spEdxaa	hi    you need to remove your carpet, and everything you can to find out where the water is coming from    we had unprotected pipes under concrete floor which leaked|`|AA11142865	Do like the answerer before me said to do.

944iJNAdaa	I doubt you need a clamp-on ammeter for the jobs you'll be doing.  As for the multi-meter, any of these cheaper meters (and maybe the expensive ones too?) can be ruined in a moment by having it switched to the wrong position when you measure voltage, say.  For most purposes the very cheapest multi-meters work as well as more expensive ones.  My cheapest multi-meter came from Harbor Freight, where they were on sale for a buck apiece!  I bought one just because, and it works as good as any of the others I've had.  Besides, you're mostly going to be checking voltages and continuity, and those aren't very demanding tasks.  I say buy a cheap one, when that one breaks, buy another cheap one.  You'll still be better off.  :)|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	The Greenlee willdo what you need so go for it and youll be just fine.

They last forever and rarely need calibrating.  I bought one that was almost new for 15 bucks about three months ago and it is fantastic. If you are patient, you may be able to get a digital multimeter and a good clamp on amp meter for the money you can spend.|`|2f9824f26c5c0aff862cb30b3373b9a3aa	Any of them are good and the digital ones are better.  Most of them now have fused inputs so that if you put them on wrong setting and hook them up it will blow the fuse instead of the meter.  That is not to say that you cant blow one up because you can and testing amperage's like the ones found in a dryer which can run up to 10 to 12 amps are dangerous to test so a clamp on would be better.  Some of the clamp ons like the Flukes have amperage tester clamp ons plus they have the voltage and resistance checks as well.

AA11093839	usually its the weather not a tidy or messy home that brings ants inside in the first place.    there are a few effective herbal remedies for ants.  you may already have these ingredients in your cupboard.  i was resistant to spraying toxic chemicals in a home with pets and small children,...    a combo of the following worked for me    !) iI have used cinnamon to repel ants. Dust the powder along the doorways and window sills , or other places they crawl thru. This keeps them from coming in for a few days up to a week at a time, then it needs to be refreshed.  it messes up their scent tracking.    2)Get a bunch of small peppermint plants from your local nursery. Place them where the ants are. Move then to other spots as necessary. Ants hate peppermint.    3)A mixture of 50/50 salt and sugar. Place some on the trail. They bring back both the salt and sugar to the nest. The salt kills them.    4)tansy (tanacetum vulgare)  is GREAT against ants...it is a perennial herb and you just let it grow...when the flowers come, you must cut them RIGHT BEFORE they bloom...tie into a bundle, hang upside down to dry...blend them and scatter or stuff dried tansy where ever ants come in  Dried tansy mixed with dried elder leaves and placed in a bowl around the house is of great benefit to people who are asthmatic or allergy prone and who cannot tolerate commercial insect sprays    5)lemon and water in a spray bottle.  spray it where the ants may come in. window sills doorways under cabinets. they don't like the smell.    use Windex to wipe up ant trails once they arrive  olive oil poured in/around entry areas is effective too    you can build moats around pet food.

Pharaoh ants , ghost ants.  Did they give you any ant bait traps for inside?  If they did, they could take a week or 2 to do the job. Cleanliness has nothing to do with these. They are after water, and the minerals in the tap water. They don't care for rain water.  If you continue to see them, call and have them come and check again. Watch for these in kitchen and bathrooms. Don't kill any straglers, in case they put out bait traps.  You will be defeating the purpose of the bait. They need to take this back to their colony.|`|AA11548985	It takes time. don't worry if they are not fire ants they wont hurt you.|`|AA11318524	lol lock all places from outside. Um maybe?

You have to weigh the cost with the benefits of keeping a $4.00 plant alive.    My Master Gardener step mother-in-law repotted hers with good soil and not the vermiculite in which it comes from the grower.  She kept it watered until it lost most of its foliage.  Then she put it in a dark closet in her basement for months over the summer.
