PZbVIPm6aa	OMG LOL I LOOOOOOOVE VMK!! I HEARD IT IS COMING BACK. DID YOU KNOW? LOL. oK, SORRY. Onto the question. Well, first off, what are you writing about? You want to make it very relatable to readers and amusing and sometimes funny. I think you are off to a great start if you have the first sentence. A lot of times people will repeat some stuff they say int the first sentence to continue on. If you give me your topic, I could totally help you tthoughtthis. Message me or something (since you added me) Hope this helped. . .<br>  <br>  You want to explain why and how you see yourself, and who it would effect, etc. Maybe you want to just dream about stuff or maybe for iinstance be a Disney Imagineer and bring VMK back. That could totally be your essay. Where you see yourself and what you see yourself doing. A disney website creator. You could use quotete from the man himself- Mr. Walt Disney. :)(:

BVPA3Fyraa	Figure out what 10-50% of $80 is, subtract that from the original price, then see if she's right.<br>  <br>  10% = $8<br>  50% = $40<br>  <br>  $80 - $8 = $72<br>  $80 - $40 = $40<br>  <br>  Is she right?|`|tvj22PSFaa	Actually if the dresses are between 10 and 50% off she would need $40-$72 dollars.  10% of 80 is 8 and subtract that from the 80 whic gives you 72 dollars.  If it was 5% off it would be 40 dollars.  So the correct answer is she would need between $40 and $72.00.  Hope this helps!|`|OSzHAr8uaa	No because $60.00 is more than 10% off so she is not estimating in case the sale of the dress is 10% instead of 50%|`|fKcVpfDxaa	no because 40 and 60 is less than 80 and it should be more after sales tax|`|UlbHT6jfaa	Sarah is WRONG. 10% = $8... therefore 10% off is $72.00<br>  However she is right when she says $40.00, as this is 50% of $80<br>  <br>  so, $40 - $72 is needed|`|uhYKsDjRaa	10% of 80 is   0.1 * 80 = 8.   80 -8 = $72.00<br>  <br>  50% of 80 is 0.5 * 80 = 40.   80 -40 = $40.00<br>  <br>  She's going to need between 40 and 72 dollars|`|XBH61aAIaa	No, because 10 percent of 80 is 8. It is not stated if the dress is 50 percent off, 30, or 10. But, ten being lowest, it would be 80-8 which s 72. You would need at MOST $72 for the dress.

3Wxx2FPkaa	Tropical rainforests are usually found around the equator. They are common in Asia, Australia, Africa, South America, Central America, Southern Mexico and on many of the Pacific Islands. Within the World Wildlife Fund's biome classification, tropical rainforests are considered a type of tropical wet forest (or tropical moist broadleaf forest) and may also be referred to as lowland equatorial evergreen rainforest. Minimum normal annual rainfall between 1,750 millimetres (69 in) and 2,000 millimetres (79 in) occurs in this climate region. Mean monthly temperatures exceed 18 °C (64 °F) during all months of the year. Rainforests are home to half of all the living animal and plant species on the planet. Tropical rain forests are called the "world's largest pharmacy" because over one-quarter of modern medicines originate from its plants. The undergrowth in a rainforest is restricted in many areas by the lack of sunlight at ground level.This makes it possible for people and other animals to walk through the forest. If the leaf canopy is destroyed or thinned for any reason, the ground beneath is soon colonized by a dense tangled growth of vines, shrubs and small trees called a jungle.<br>  You now have to make a choice between the countries.

MB93Run3aa	Relax it is never too late to enroll in public school. Your parents tax dollars pay to entitle you the priviledge of a free and appropriate education.  Don't worry where the students currently are in their textbook or the amount of work that you think that will be required to do each week because when you enter the school the teacher will develop a plan to get you caught up with the other students. No one will expect you to be able to do the same amount of work or have the same knowledge as students who have been enrolled in the public school since the beginning of the school year. Get started because you can always make up lost ground over the summer and you will definitely look forward to a great year next year. You will have met new friends, be familiar with the school and the teachers and will not have any of your same apprehensions about thinking that you will be behind the other students or not able to keep up. When you go to the source below type in "homeschooling" in the search box and you will find additional information about homeschooling and links to other website's that will provide you with additional information to help you feel more comfortable with your decision to attend a public school.|`|zhJOZhKEaa	A *public* school should allow enrollment at any time to anyone in the district.  What is not guarenteed is that they will place you in the same grade level that you have been working on.  Some schools do not 'recognize' work done by homeschoolers at all... some require testing before they give you your credits... others may take your credits.<br>  <br>  And Christopher T:  It is not 'the law' that you must be attending a *public* school at any age in any state.  Homeschooling is a legal option everywhere in the US and in most other countries around the world.|`|UOM1FV9Daa	and if you are wondering why we gave that 1st guy thumbs down its because I don't know what freakin' law he was looking at but you can be homeschool all of your schooling years...you never have to go to a public school. And I would talk with the principal. It isn't too late now but I wouldn't put it off either|`|rTaaIXSuaa	Enrollment in a public school is year round. There is no closing period.|`|yJSPecgoaa	Hi there,  <br>  <br>  In some states it actually *can* be "too late" to enroll in your local public school, but NOT at your age of 15.  Compulsory education in the (slim) majority of states is until the age of 16.  After you reach a certain specified age (but never under the age of 16), and depending on state laws, public schools are NOT required to let you in.  <br>  <br>  [This infuriates me, of course, as it is yet one more fallacy inherent in our public education system (not to mention NCLB).  Just this past week, a 17-year old poster right here on YA was understandably upset because her local high school would not allow her to enroll, even though she badly wanted to return to high school and get her diploma.  (She had been out of school for an extended period of time due to a lengthy illness.)  It turned out that, because she was over the age of 16, no high school in her area would take her, merely because they didn't *have to,*  on account of her state's compulsory laws going up only to age 16. Personally, I think it's a crime, especially in a country that at least pays lip service to how "important" an education is.]<br>  <br>  But in your case (and please forgive the rant above), you needn't worry!  Being under the age of 16 as you are, your local high school almost certainly HAS  to take you in.  In the United States, 26 states set the cutoff age at 16, whereas the remaining states require students to stay in school through age 17 or 18.  Either way, you are covered at the age of 15!<br>  <br>  Here's wishing you the best of luck!|`|0WASp0bHaa	. <br>  People move all during the year. And kids are enrolling into public schools all during the school year. <br>  <br>  Your parents would need to contact the school's office and arrange for your transcripts to be sent.
AA11043457	Too bad both isn't an option as I think that is possible.<br>  <br>  A teacher has to be strict as she/he must take control of the class to keep everyone on subject and in a learning mode.  If the kids get distracted or begin to talk then they lose the valuable minutes and a class is only minutes most of the time, not hours.  They accumulate up but they are short and must be in depth.<br>  <br>  Even in the block program, they have longer time but then they must get in everything that they would normally have all week in that class. <br>  They can't afford to spend too much time goofing off or being off track. <br>  <br>  Teahers don't have to be your best friend and many times should not be. You have peers for that.  A teaher should be pleasant and nice to the point where a kid would feel she/he could talk to the teacher to discuss a problem and didn't fear the teacher, but the teacher is not there as a friend.  A teacher may be a mentor but that and a friend is not the same.  A teacher is expected to give adult guidance and not be a peer at the same level.  The teaher needs to instill competene and good judgment in the studnet and help them make good deisions. A friend often goes along with what their friend wants and that can be dangerous - both to education and to the child who may come with problems.<br>  <br>  When it comes  down to the bottom line, a teacher needs to be a bit on the stide of strict, but with the warmth of being nice, not buddy-buddy but still nie.  Yet the teacher should never forget that he or she is the adult and has a responsibility to the student, to the parents and to society to train those hildren to cope in soiety and to learn the best they are capable of doing, and at times, exceeding what someone thought was possible.  That is what a teaher does - causes their students  to keep their feet on the ground and stretch almost beyond their capacity to the stars.|`|kQea8cJ0aa	Actually a teacher can both strict and nice at the same time.<br>  <br>  Strictness implies also firmness and nice teachers can also be firm so they are no mutually exclusive.<br>  <br>  Good discipline and good teaching come from mutual respect between both the teacher and student.  When you respect the student and treat them good and also maintain a consistent plan for handling issues both win.  The teacher can then teach in an environment where there are no questions about how a problem will be handled.  The students learn and they are treated well.  If you are too lenient you are not nice and you are not doing the students any favors in allowing them to be loud and disrespectful.  They are not learning and you are no serving the other students who can not hear or concentrate on the class.  If you allow the students to constantly argue with you about something that you told them to do you waste everyone's valuable time.<br>  <br>  Gail|`|4kmUX5pHaa	The best is the mixture of the two. In our own life we can never be too good always, we can't take sweet always, we do need some sour taste too for our better taste. Similarly if a teacher is NICE always he may not be taken seriously or tried to be mislead at that moment strict action is needed for the betterment of the students just as when we are sick we have to take  a tablet of bitter taste.|`|9hC5zE64aa	A teacher's duty is to inspire and motivate students to learn; you cannot teach a person says Shaw. The students must learn themsleves. The teacher should be firm, strict and nicer is some old wife's tale and cannot be practical in modern class room.

Once the sugary base has been manufactured, hints of spice are added to mask any potentially harsh or bitter sensations. The base for spearmint Stride, for example, tastes slightly herbal when left alone;  Researchers enhanced the gum's palatability by adding sharper notes of mint, as well as cooling compounds that soothe the jowls. (The other Stride flavor is Winterblue, a wintergreen variant with peppermint top notes, and colored with Blue No. 2 Lake, a food additive.)|`|3TQCwtxJaa	Stride seems to last longest.|`|mds9LpTeaa	five gum is the LONGEST, but out of yours....stride|`|0Cy2PqA2aa	stride|`|3nGhryADaa	stride:)|`|93Sd2s8Iaa	stride

ejxgo3Qkaa	I tend to agree with your idea of poetry, that for it to be called a poem some technique has to exist in it for it to have some kind of literary value. However I kind of feel that the popular opinion nowadays seems to be that any person who writes down their thoughts and feelings in 2 or 3 stanzas, is deemed to have created a poem. The focus seems to be more on the process gone though to create the poem, rather than the end result. I don't really agree that this should be called poetry, cause it could be any written about any old nonsense. It can be compared to giving an elephant a paintbrush and calling the resulting spatter on canvas 'contemporary art'. Does the elephant have talent? i dont think so... :S however the art still sells for a fortune. Some people are easily persuaded into what constitutes decent poetry/ art. Idiots...;)<br>  <br>  This was written really late at night, sorry if its a mish-mash of ramblings! ;)|`|cFfPVj9caa	its called free verse<br>  some say not evrything goes for free verse but all u free vereses u read pretty much say anything<br>  poetry is just anyhting that isnt prose<br>  and poems naturally have a rhythm beacuse we stress certain syllables in words like toDAY we dont say TOday<br>  and meter is not always needed in poetry just like rhymes arent always needed<br>  and ur right very few ppl can right certain types of poetry like sonnet or more complicated poetry but everyone can write free verse<br>  they may not be good or but it is poetry whether u realize it or not|`|HhDesnNzaa	Like most art forms, poetry is subjective. People string together words and call it poetry because it has meaning to them. If they are fortunate, it strikes a chord or sparks emotion in others. <br>  If you don't like free form poetry, you don't have to read it. If you want to try some good non rhyming poetry i recommend e e cummings.|`|jziyTfLZaa	Poems don't really require anything, and just throwing words together does constitute a poem, just not a very good one.|`|479460cc8a083eaa121c7c4f99e95066aa	A poem does not have to rhyme. There is Haiku, iambic, free verse. It makes sense to people who write it and people who share in the same thought process. T.S. Elliot is not like Ferlinghetti or Alan Ginsberg.

noL54L5Eaa	can visible light out shine infrared radiation?<br>  <br>  In this comparative project, you'll be looking at two types of electromagnetic radiation.<br>  <br>  Electromagnetic radiation is energy that travels in transverse waves, and is measured in wavelengths.<br>  <br>  A wavelength is measured from the top of one crest to the top of the next crest. The shorter the wavelength is, the more energy it contains.<br>  <br>  Gamma rays have the shortest wavelengths and radio waves have the longest wavelengths. Just as the names imply, these waves include magnetic and electrical components.<br>  <br>  Electromagnetic radiation includes forms of energy ranging from visible light to radio waves, microwaves, and gamma rays.<br>  <br>  These different energies are part of the electromagnetic spectrum, of which only a very small part is the visible spectrum of light containing all the colors in the rainbow.<br>  <br>  The infrared radiation that comes from a remote control device, such as the TV clicker, has a larger wavelength than visible light, although we can't see it with the naked eye. On the other side of visible light is ultraviolet radiation from the sun. That's the stuff that causes sunburn and skin cancer.<br>  <br>  These wavelengths are shorter, and therefore they have more energy than infrared radiation or visible light. Again though, you can't see that type of radiation with the naked eye.<br>  <br>  For this experiment, you'll use an ordinary flashlight, a TV remote control and a few variables such as a glass of water, a glass of milk, sheets of paper, and a piece of plywood that's as large as your TV screen.<br>  <br>  To compare these two types of radiation, you'll need to set up a testing area in a room that contains a television.<br>  <br>  Place a piece of tape on the floor 8 feet (2.4 meters) away from the TV. This is where you'll stand to conduct each test of this experiment.<br>  <br>  Darken the room as much as possible, and make sure the TV is turned off.<br>  <br>  You'll conduct the following series of tests separately for the remote control—the source of infrared radiation—and the flashlight—the source of visible light.<br>  <br>  Conduct each test with the flashlight first, recording your observations in a journal. Then perform the same test, using the remote control. Again, record your observations.<br>  <br>  All tests are performed with you standing at the 8-feet tape mark.<br>  <br>  Test 1: Shine the flashlight at the TV screen and record what you see. Repeat with the remote control. <br>  Test 2: Hold a glass of water directly in front of each device and record your observations when you turn each of them on. <br>  Test 3: Hold a glass of milk in front of each, turn each one on, and record your observations. <br>  How do the milk and water affect how we see the light? Can the TV still be turned on if the radiation is passing through glass and a liquid? <br>  Test 4: Hold a piece of paper in front of each device and turn them on. How many pieces of paper are needed to completely block the visible light from shining onto the TV screen? How many pieces of paper are needed to prevent the infrared radiation from penetrating through the paper so the TV won't turn on? <br>  Test 5: Have someone hold the piece of plywood directly in front of the TV screen. Make sure your helper is to the side of the plywood, not in front of it. Turn on each light. Record what you see. <br>  Test 6: Continue to decrease the distance between the plywood and the flashlight/remote control in 2-foot increments. Turn on the device and record your observations.<br>  As you should have been able to observe, not all radiation is created equal. Can you think of other ways to test the properties of these two types of radiation? What other variables could you use? How far away can you be from the TV and still turn it on with the remote control? What is its working range? Can you still see the light from the flashlight on the TV screen at that distance?<br>  <br>  Create a chart that shows your observations from the tests. What could account for the differences? Do some research before you begin this project to gain a better understanding of electromagnetic radiation.

ApG0DpzXaa	As technology evolves and consumers update their phones, computers, games, Ipods, etc... etc...  .  Consumers end up with drawers full of obselete chargers, usb cables etc... (short electrical cords with plugs on one end and item specific adaptors on the other end.)  <br>  <br>  Just to get up on my soapbox for a minute, the sheer waste of resources this represents is stomach turning.  Why can't all these devices have the same standard chargers and cables?<br>  <br>  Back to the idea;  Collect a bunch of these 3ft. to 4ft.  wires (roughly 30), and weave them loosly into a net of 2inch squares.  attach the net inside of a metal frame sturdy enough to withstand the pull of a vine or tomato plant growing up it and through it (if you're not a gardener, you'd be surprised how sturdy a plant support a healthy tomato plant with a lot of heavy fruit can wreck).  Idealy attach two of these net in a frame trellis pieces at the top making a wedge or tent shape that the ends of the frame can be driven into the ground a few inches.<br>  <br>  The idea would be to "pitch" this recycled wire net tent over the tomato plant or vine and as the plant pulls the support toward the ground with it's weight, the ends of the frame will be driven further into the ground making the frame part of the support stronger.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|H8akJCZZaa	Make a trash can out of the cardboard box, then throw the paper and old jeans into it :)|`|1V3IcvTmaa	I found some very cool ideas.

AA11981656	For California, the major doesn't necessarily matter.  What matters most is if you can pass the CSET.  There's also the CBEST, but you should be able to pass that.  Then, there are 2-3 CSET tests that you have to take, depending on what subject or grade you want to work with.  If you want to teach math, you need to pass at least 2 CSET math tests.  It may help to major in math to pass those tests.  Otherwise, there is a way to teach it by completing courses, but you need to look at the individual school where you plan on getting your credential to figure out whether you qualify by coursework.

You could also have your parents talk to the principal.  A word of caution for both situations--your parents must be very respectful of the teacher while they ask for something specific to change.  I am a 2nd grade teacher, and I know that my principal sees many irate parents.  Well, irate parents are the ones who get ignored at my school because they are unreasonable.  <br>  <br>  Have your parents respectfully (but firmly) express their dissatisfaction to the principal.  Ask your friends or their parents to also express their dissatisfaction, but don't make it a group!  Have them all do it separately.  <br>  <br>  Also, if it is possible, switch classes.  I had an Honors Algebra  II teacher who didn't know what she was talking about.  Literally, we'd correct her work.  It was awful.  By the end of the first month of school, only 12 or 13 out of the 35 kids were left in her class.  The next year, she got transferred to another school.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11434355	Of course there are bad teachers, just like there are bad people in any profession.<br>  To say, though, that teachers are just in it for the money is ludicrous as teachers in this country are paid shamefully low wages. Perhaps many teachers just get burned out because of the low wages, cut budgets, overbearing administration, disinterested students who expect to be entertained, and parents who think that teachers are to blame for all their children's problems.<br>  However, it does sound like you just have a bad draw this time around. If you can, as a previous poster suggested, try to transfer to another class, at least in art. If you are stuck in these classes, then just make the best of it and learn what you can.|`|pn3mQqGIaa	some teachers really are just not good at teaching<br>  <br>  in seventh grade, my spanish teacher gave us wordsearches all year, for words we didnt know and when we asked, she told us to look them up, but there wasnt any dictionary.<br>  <br>  you've gotta get a teacher who really cares about thier students and loves what they do<br>  ive got a teacher like that now and thats my favorite class.<br>  <br>  luck of the draw.|`|28pcgUw4aa	I am a teacher, and I can honestly say that I care.  I may not be great at teaching, but I certainly try to be good; I try to get through to the students in regard to whatever concept we are learning, and I try to go for a little variety  I will say, though, that there is only so much one teacher can do for each individual.  I can't be a private tutor to individual students as much as some of them actually need.  And that is not my fault.   I also care -- almost too much -- about students' grades in general.  But....(big BUT)...I easily lose a bit of how much I care (in individual cases) when it becomes clear to me that the student cares very little about his or her grades.  It's hard to keep caring when the student doesn't care.

9hC5zE64aa	Spending money for unnecessary things has been going on from time immemorial. The present period is considered to be a period of recession and the worst of it is in the USA, but Obama's inauguration show spent US $ 150  million for nothing. He made a lot of speech about reducing expenses, but when it came to his own inauguaration as the 44th president, he forgot everything about recession; he went on spending and nobody questioned him because he is a popular president. In your school also, the same thing had happened; the management wanted to send out the teachers; they made it recession as a ploy to do their mischevious work. You just accept the fact and you cannot rectify the world which is crooked.Let the redundant teachers find new fields; the world is an open forum; opportunities are under their own feet and let them find them.|`|AA11434355	Try first sending a petition around to all of the students to let the administration know that you all benefit from this teacher's instruction.

I don't know that I really am though.  (My long-term goal is to teach middle school; I'm just teaching elementary now because that was what was dealt me). I do like the 3rd through 5th graders sweetness and innocence though; they have far less attitude than middle schoolers.

Whether they actually do is often up to you and the expectations you set (and maintain) with them.  They can do so much more than littler kids.

Go in after school or before school and ask for homework help. Even if you don't have homework, offer to go in after school just to do your textbook reading. Just show that you are willing to man up to your mistakes and are willing to put in the effort to correct them.

So just plug those points and your slope into the equation.  so you could either have -2 - y = 3(5-x).<br>  <br>  OR you could have...<br>  <br>  y + 2 = 3(x-5)             It was a plus because it was negative, 2 negatives make a positive.<br>  <br>  HAHA, the guys below me don't even have their equation right. lol, and he said he did it last week too.  they're thinking of slope intercept form, which is y=mx+b.

Swmd0P2uaa	Ok, but I'm not writing the whole thing. <br>  <br>  You walked up the dark apartment complex- staircase, the steps moaned and creaked, almost like they were warning you to turn back. You came to the apartment number you had been given by your parents. Hopefully this new tutor would be able to help you with your English homework, which you're having so much trouble with... You knock on the old hollow door boards and step back to greet your new tutor. You wonder what she will look like, if she's old-or closer to your age. After a few minutes and a few knocks you decide to try the handle. Its feel gritty and cold. Its covered with rust, you wonder how long its been since someone has turned it. The door is open. Inside you see the small kitchen on the left, and a living room just after the threshold. There are no lights on, but you can see a thick blanket of dust, draping over the 20th century style Ches lounge and record player. After some contemplation, you decide to investigate, after all this is the right address. A bug flies past you, and you notice the musky old smell of moth balls coming from the closet. As you enter the living room you here a faint sound, like gunfire and yelling. It must be the record player? You turn around and suddenly your in a large field littered with fallen soldiers and wounded horses. You can smell the gunpowder in the air, you can hear the commands being shouted farther out in the distance then you can see.....<br>  <br>  Okay you finish it!

Then add the cost of labor if there is one, and wala! that is your answer.|`|9Lq7cjgPaa	Well, we know that a square yard is 3x3 feet. This is probably a much easier problem if you draw it out to visualize it, but the easiest way to do this is to divide each dimension by 3:<br>  <br>  24 feet long / 3 feet per yard = 8 yards long<br>  18 feet wide / 3 feet per yard = 6 yards wide<br>  <br>  If you draw this out, you will see that you now have a total of 48 squares that are each 3 feet x 3 feet. You can now multiply the number of squares you have by the cost per square, totaling $576.<br>  <br>  It always helps to draw things out!

AA11375099	I attended the UW school of Business.  I transferred in from SCCC.  You are right to be thinking about volunteer opportunities to show that you are active in the community.<br>  <br>  You could volunteer to help younger students with math and english.  I used to do that in Jr. High School.  There was also a club I joined in H.S. that came up with an item to market and then we started our own business.  I think it was Junior Acheivement.<br>  <br>  It is great you are thinking now about getting into the UW.  They just cut 300 college positions and in the future it will be pretty competitive to get into the School of Business.<br>  <br>  Lots of my classmates from SCCC could not transfer into the Seattle Campus they ended up in Tacoma or Bothel.  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Dave

MUCH more freedom. dont take it for granted, enjoy middle school. you will get more homework- so you need to be on the ball with that. do your homework before goofing off. take this oppurtunity before highschool to try new sports or continue ones you already play. pay attention to academics- it will prepare you for highschool, help you get into a better highschool if you're going to a private highschool diferent than your middle school, and the knowledge will be useful later in life.<br>  have fun :)|`|vPbM2F13aa	uhhh...you spelled middle school wrong.....and advice......<br>  how bought learning some better vocabulary?<br>  read some books...?<br>  go to school?|`|Udi10LOxaa	what is invice? and you spelled middle school wrong.|`|GZ9LjS13aa	Learn to spell correctly.<br>  You will get higher grades if you do this!|`|Gd2Q9rTlaa	just hang out with people of your same grade|`|2Ck0OLlDaa	Spell better...

However, as a professor, it's her job to help her students to succeed by any means necessary, even enduring constant contacts from one of her students.  Remember, you're paying her to help you succeed. In other words don't hold back, don't feel that you're annoying her because you wanted to make sure that she got your assignment and that is what I call being a responsible student.|`|LX6AQ4kuaa	I think you've contacted her enough to get your message across clearly and she will reply as soon as possible.

YOPakrItaa	" The Alpha Honors Program at Lane Tech College Prep High School is an intensive honors program focusing on science fair, mathematics, technical reading and writing, engineering, and technology. Students eligible to enroll in the Alpha Honors Program complete their science, mathematics, and English courses in a cohort setting. This cohort setting consists of approximately 30 Alpha Honors students who attend their science, mathematics, and English courses together each day as a team. Alpha Honors students are programmed with the same students in these three core areas and are randomly programmed in their remaining classes. The result is students experience a “team approach” in the honors curricular offering provided by the science, mathematics, and English courses.<br>  <br>  Alpha Honors students engage in highly structured curricula in their science, mathematics, and English classes. The Alpha teachers employ an aligned curriculum and support students in the development of problem-solving skills, experimental design, data and statistical analysis, library research techniques, and technical reading and writing skills. The Alpha Honors students and teachers are afforded a unique educational experience at Lane Tech and work as a “team.” As a result, students are provided a high-quality, challenging curriculum that prepares students for college success.<br>  <br>  Incoming freshman Alpha Honors students are provided a one-week workshop in which they meet with the Alpha team teachers and sophomore Alpha students to engage in peer one-on-one mentoring and prepare for the upcoming school year.<br>  <br>  The Alpha Honors Program is a rigorous program that also qualifies Alpha students to enroll in AP courses (for college credit) and begin working with university personnel at the onset of freshman year.

1d02fcff81d2bb070fc361fbe28e3606aa	Cheaper ... definitely.  My kids have always worn school uniforms.  They wear like iron.  You can probably pass them down to your great-grandchildren even.  In fact, they are so durable that our school even has a used uniform sale once a year where you can buy used uniform pieces for less than $5 and believe me, you cannot tell the used ones from new ones.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Okay, I looked up our school uniforms from the uniform store we get ours at (Educational Outfitters) and for our school uniforms, the prices are as follows:<br>  <br>  Skirt           $37.99<br>  Blouse          15.99<br>  Jumper        38.99<br>  Pants           24.99|`|fQ1qDMaqaa	Definately more expensive.|`|rNE7XAmgaa	Cheaper because your going to wear this outfit everyday, regular clothes you need more of , and okay looking ones too, cause you don't want to look like a hobo or wear the same outfit every day if it's not a school uniform.<br>  <br>  I've gone to a school where you wear a uniform everyday.|`|AA12384954	I have found that they are in the more expensive range, but tend to be good quality.  As long as you purchase them with lots of room to grow you should get some good value for your money.  I know that they can look a little boring, especially as you have to wear them almost every day, but everyone else looks just as boring too!|`|yTMWfQM5aa	I would have to say in the long run, cheaper. I'm just going off of experience. My school uniform was $300.00. But i spend way more then that on out fits throughout a school year. Especially since I have expensive taste. So ya I'm going to say cheaper.|`|NY6HkQEvaa	very expensive<br>  i got vest for like 50 bucks and it doesn't even keep u warm|`|bHuuBaT1aa	Actually, it isn't as expensive. Even though I'm going to 9th grade and next year 8th graders are having uniforms, I heard that their uniforms are button shirts and dark pants. All you need to buy is different shirts and 5 pants for the week. 2 pairs of new shoes and if you know how to take care of washing them, then you're fine for the week. Not only that but no one is gunna look better than another person because everyone is the same. That's what I know.|`|44VpxjtCaa	Uniforms are way cheaper because kids now days don't go for the cheap clothes brands. We normally go for more name brand clothing, like Hollister, Abercrombie, Jordan & such.|`|wLCcY5RXaa	school uniforms are more expinsive but then it depeds on the schools bugget and how fancy it is like the basic uniform would be a t shirt and maby some slacks and thats it but it can also be the nice suit to that does cost a pretty penny|`|URGLdPABaa	cheaper, one of the reasons for school uniforms is so kids with out money wont be made fun of... and to kill individualism.|`|5hKiN1xhaa	School uniforms are less expensive|`|g2VCzUKoaa	Expensive! depends on the type of uniform|`|IrnUmX2haa	more expensive
yCBsi5OYaa	you didn't add any info but if you dont study will not pass.|`|rghk8yMeaa	uhmm you didnt say anything that would make me think you would move on. try having proper grammer and actually explaining why your teacher thinks you would be held back.|`|L0LUGdc3aa	As long as you study, I'm sure you'll do fine. I'm not saying it's going to be easy though. Most times, final tests that determine if you'll be moving on or not are difficult, so it's going to take a while of practice. Make sure to study each subject for 45 minutes each night with your parents. Which subjects are your weakest? Focus on those most, and then move on to your strongest as you advance in your studying through the night. Prove to your teacher your determined, and that your really trying to improve. If not, maybe discuss with your mom if she can talk to her about a summer school program that will allow you to advance to fifth grade even if you don't pass your test. And to the rest of you, cussing at a small girl (if that's who you really are) get a life, and don't even bother answering the question if you think she's lying.

Equally, it can be something as simple as suddenly remembering something you were supposed to do and forgot.<br>  Send a birthday card to someone. Make a phone call?<br>  <br>  Student behavior can undermine a teacher's confidence, I've just read in Yahoo Answers where students made a teacher's life hell and he lost his job. How awful is that?<br>  <br>  Take one day in your life and keep a record of the number of times you were distracted and the cause. Ever hear your Mom say, "You don't listen to a word I say?"<br>  <br>  Back in time my wife said to me, "Repeat what I have just told you?"<br>  <br>  I looked at her lovingly and said, "This is terrible,how can one so young be having memory problems - I can't believe you have forgotten what you have told me seconds ago!"<br>  <br>  Of course we both knew I was trying to bluff my way out of not having heard a word because I was distracted. Humor does have its place in situations like that.<br>  <br>  I imagine that students have many distractions and I guess you know better than I what they are.<br>  <br>  Listening is an important art; there are ways of showing the other person that you are in fact listening - you keep eye contact, lean toward the person, nod your head in a way that says, "I'm listening.|`|Ky0e3wOhaa	my boyfriends cuteness...

YjvTQntAaa	Some English teachers may say that it is in order to teach good form, but as an English degree holder (there needs to be a name for that), I can say that technically, the simplest and clearest way to say something is best. If that means an antecedent goes in a prepositional phrase, then make sure you have a good reason. Generally, it will make things confusing, though, since pronouns usually relate to subjects within their clauses. Further, the mind wants to gloss over prepositional phrases, so when your eyes come to the pronoun, you start wondering what its referring to.

I know a few people who did this and got to geometry and Algebra 2 for the requirements. Also, you simply cannot compare yourself to everyone else in your fmaily, because you are not them. Do what you are capable of and don't regret anything. As far as the math problem, look to hiring a tutor or ask the teacher for some extra help if you are confused. You should do fine, don't sweat it.

While I know that a teaching license isn't required, an experienced or well-trained teacher is imperative.  To even think that a school would allow a coach to teach such a vital subject is shocking to me.<br>  <br>  Teaching is a commitment.  It isn't a job you can leave after 5pm and not think of again until 9 the next morning.  Teaching is a lifestyle.  Be prepared if you are to teach, that it isn't just a random job opportunity because children's education is at stake.<br>  <br>  That all being said (and my disgust of the private school system being evident) know that jobs in general are tough to find.

TDvWWrGlaa	keep in mind that just because you sign up for the class, you aren't required to take the exam<br>  <br>  with that being said, i'd say go for it! i took the class as a sophmore and it was one of the most helpful classes i have ever taken. even though i was already a good writer, the class taught me how to recognize techniques writers use to influence readers, which is a huge help when you need read just about anything! and yes, they are generally should be a ton of in class essays, and if your teacher doesn't give you a lot of essays, you are not being prepared for the exam. usually the class consists of essay writing and learned about literary techniques, rhetoric and syntax being taking the bulk of the techniques<br>  <br>  its an all-around helpful class whether or not you take the test. and entrances should not be based on psat scores, because many people don't even take the psat. however, even though the class does not have a requirement testwise, you need to be extremely dedicated and willing to work in it, because AP classes are usually filled with bright, motivated students and a teacher will not take it 'slow and easy' if you don't get it. but go ahead and try it if you're willing to take on a challenge.<br>  <br>  and yes, you can get tutoring for almost anything. if you can't find a service, just ask a student in class if they would be willing to help you out; most are.

viqIb6X7aa	well. basically Palestine has been sending rockets into settlements in Israel for the past 8 years. Israel decided to fight against the terrorist group known as HAMAS by entering Gaza. They attempted to kill as little as possible but HAMAS made that very difficult. Gaza is the most dense area in the world and Israel tried to do as little harm to civilians as possible. Before they would strike an area they would send flyers telling civilians to leave the area. In the end Israel agreed to a cease fire unfortunately the terrorist organization known as HAMAS is still sending rockets into Israel and the civilians in Israel live in constant fear of rockets. HAMAS targets civilians and gives no warning to the state of Israel. Civilians in communities of Sderot have a mere 15 seconds to find shelter. It is a terrible situation and the world should note the terror that Gaza imposes on Israel.|`|HJaVcUGwaa	The best answer to this quesiton gives you a brief history of the conflict.

SIhxrxD3aa	Because every high school uses a different weighting system, colleges look at your unweighted GPA primarily.  Your weighted GPA is mostly used to determine your class rank (which colleges look at also).|`|6740cce5db21709e63b8aa09900b506baa	Make sure your unweighted is at least a 3.5 or higher (depending on how many honors/AP classes you take) <br>  Because if you get a 4.1 and you are taking 4 honors classes, your unweighted is already a 3.7 and universities would consider your weighted more because you are taking so many honors classes<br>  But if you are only taking one honors class and your GPA is like a 3.7<br>  and your unweighted is like a 3.5 or 3.4 then colleges would be really disappointed.<br>  <br>  So either do well in a lot of honors classes, or do well in a couple of honors class, but aim to get at least a B or A in ANY honors or AP class<br>  any lower might hurt you as it did for me =[<br>  My weighted was like a 3.43<br>  but my unweighted was like a 2.9<br>  (i took 3 honors and 1 AP)|`|oHGmXlE6aa	They look at your Aced.

Try some of the UC schools that arn't as competitive as usc as well as some of the higher ranking Cal State schools like San Diego and San Luis Obispo<br>  <br>  good luck.

AA10176626	No.<br>  <br>  Your financial aid award will depend on two things that no one here could possibly know:<br>  <br>  How you'll answer the 100+ questions on the FAFSA and how many of your fellow Fashion Institute students will be applying for aid next year. <br>  <br>  The FAFSA has more than 100 questions for a reason - it takes that much information to determine your household's financial aid need and eligibility. If anyone here could read your mind and discern the answers to all of those questions, we'd be offered an opportunity to manage financial aid for the US Department of Education.<br>  <br>  Furthermore - the fact that you might qualify for this or that program is only as good as the ability of FIDM to actually allocate money to you from that program. Some forms of aid are relatively unlimited - you will qualify for a Stafford loan, and that money is yours to borrow, no matter how many other students take out Stafford loans at your school. <br>  <br>  Similarly, eligibility for the Pell Grant program is tied entirely to the Expected Family Contribution score that is derived from your FAFSA application. If your EFC score falls below 4041, you will receive a Pell Grant - again, regardless of how many other FIDM students also qualify.<br>  <br>  Other financial aid programs are limited - your school (and every other school) gets an allotment from the Department of Education each year. At that point, your school needs to split up that pool of funds as effectively as they can. If many of your classmates have greater financial aid need, your school may not be able to award you money from some of those programs.<br>  <br>  Finally - your financial aid has nothing to do with your high school GPA. I think you are confusing financial aid with scholarships. Financial aid is awarded strictly on the basis of your family's ability to pay for school - not on the basis of your high school grades. <br>  <br>  Scholarships are awarded to attract applications from students with exceptional grades. Only FIDM will be able to decide if your 3.0 is the kind of grade point average that they're looking to reward.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped you get a better understanding of the system. You will receive an aid offer letter from the financial aid office at FIDM, letting you know what types of aid they have available for you. The letter will provide detailed instructions on what you must do to accept and receive the aid.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|tfgAayNgaa	It all depends on your families income and their effort.

oIpsJ3Bgaa	The book without a doubt.  Here's why:<br>  <br>  1)You won't learn as much vocabulary with a video game<br>  2)Very little is left to the imagination with VGs<br>  3)Off topic but: Video games are expensive as f*ck<br>  4)You don't get the same kind of philosophy from a video game.<br>  5)Finishing a big book is more satisfying than playing a game like RuneScape.<br>  6)You learn to read faster and pick up more, which is more valuable than having fast thumbs.<br>  7)Reading improves your grade.  Video games have the inverse effect.<br>  8)Sheer numbers of books outweigh the number of game titles.<br>  9)You have more in common with most adults if you read books instead of playing video games.<br>  10)Reading improves your writing skills because you start to distinguish between what is interesting and what is not.<br>  <br>  Ta-da :)|`|SSbeC1Xxaa	Sometimes, yes video games can be more educational than reading. There haven't been any newer games (to my knowledge but I haven't actively looked either) that are quite as educational as some of the earlier ones. I still remember playing Carmen Sandiego, Pajama Sam, Freddie the Fish, Putt Putt the Car, and other games of that sort when I was little. I would think that playing a game like Civilization or Rome Total War would be a little more educational if the people playing it actually knew what was going on during that time period and civilization. I do think though, that a game like Call of Duty (not modern warfare) might be a fun activity for history students on a free day (I played Halo 2 in orchestra with the teacher on finals day cause there wasn't any final to take).|`|QRrURcQDaa	It depends on the game. It does increase reflexes though.|`|xMnN99T8aa	Read a book a week then decide.

You can work anywhere in the world you want and don't have to worry about losing your job (people will never stop getting sick).  Along those lines, you can make a lot of money.  In certain specialties and in certain areas you might make mediocre pay, but if you want six figures it's yours with a 4 year degree.

KqprngOsaa	Colleges do like to see how do you on AP tests so they have some method with which to compare you to other students across the nation, but if the subject is entirely unrelated to what you're studying in college and you wouldn't have to take it anyway (I would check to make sure the college doesn't require a freshmen lecture class in that subject) then don't worry about missing one or two tests. I decided not to take the AP stats test and that didn't stop me from getting into a pretty good schools.|`|fJ4nYzVWaa	Just take the test..what classes are they?? If its a foreign language or something not involved in your major, you might still have to have a class in that certain subject. If you do bad, the college does see the score but it might look worse if you don't take the test at all. They will see you took the class but there was no test result.

pDvlQQkcaa	Parents have rights to challenge the IEP, a benefit of special education. Students without disabilities and their families lack the right to challenge curriculum decisions. <br>  <br>  The answer is, you have every right to challenge this all the way up to the Federal level if you oppose this, including with lawyers who are specially trained in special education law. <br>  <br>  It is not something which the school has the right to continue just doing--and merely because they are the school either. <br>  <br>  When your son was first enrolled in special education, you should have been given a pamphlet/booklet outlining the procedure for the IEP, including what to do when you disagree with the initial outcome of a decision. <br>  <br>  Also consider talking with the state education department's special education division for resources/referrals to community groups. And the US Department of Education provides free down-loadable brochures on its website about the legal rights of students with disabilities and their parents, including the general process for challenging an IEP decision.|`|PnlgLBcwaa	you can definately refuse to sign the IEP-they would than have to take you to due process to continue it--if not--it is done<br>  <br>  I'm guessing that he is otherwise in regular ed--with no other special ed support--technically he shouldn't have an IEP if this were teh case--it shoudl be a 504 plan..<br>  <br>  If it is the same 2 sounds---he should have been given speech homework--and you should be able to continue practicing the sounds at home-would you consider a reduction in services-maybe a 1x/month consultation-with the homework to be done the rest of the month<br>  <br>  doctors are not experts on speech therapy--the SLP is teh authority here|`|ne8mBivvaa	You could go into due process to settle the matter.  They can force you to keep him in the program if they choose.  When your child becomes older and may be embarrassed by his impediment, he could possibly sue the school system for not protecting his rights and providing him with the proper therapy for his disability. <br>  <br>   You did not say how long your child has been in speech.  If he is still in elementary, he will still benefit from speech.  Students do reach a maximum in their therapy and do not benefit from further therapy. However, that usually happens in later grades such as junior high and high school.<br>  <br>  The school can decide it is not worth the effort to fight with you as a parent and write him out with a notice of action stating the parent removed from speech and refused services.  However, think about this....<br>  <br>  As your child becomes an adult and goes to apply for professional jobs, how will he be interpreted?  Some professional employers are turned off by a person who speaks with an impediment.  It can adversely affect his ability to be understood and to communicate his thoughts clearly.<br>  <br>  If the child is not happy, you might just need to explain to him how important it is to use good sounds and to be able to speak properly when he gets older.  It is similar to getting immunizations to stay well....<br>  <br>  At what stage is he in his therapy?  Is he still learning to make the sound or is he using the sound in syllables, words, sentences, or unstructured speech??  That would also determine whether you should remove him.<br>  <br>  If you have a good speech pathologist, they are working with the teacher to find times that he is not missing important instruction.  Unfortunately, and sometimes this does not make sense, they cannot be removed from PE, recess, art, etc. <br>  <br>  After working in this field for several years, I can promise you that we do not want to keep kids in therapy any longer than necessary.  The paperwork, the time it takes, and the number of students we serve grows each year.   Therefore, to keep a student in the program is a decision that is not taken lightly and the earliest possible release from the program is considered.  You can dismiss them too early and erase everything that was learned.
1AgD0dsBaa	Timeline--Revolutions of 1848<br>  1846-1849: Economic depression was spread throughout Europe. It was marked by rising food prices after a poor harvest and the recession that followed the industrial expansionin the early 1840s.<br>  <br>  February 22, 1848: One of many banquets to protest the government's inflexibility was planned, but he government banned it.

All of these revolutions followed the same pattern: The news of revolution in France would attract excited crowds, groups of men (mostly journalists, lawyers, and students) met to discuss the rumors. The government, in fear of revolution, would call out the army, which would begin to skirmish with the citizenry. Barricades would come up and mob action would ensue.

a36a4f0aa2d7f129af1802cbaa36ec85aa	Marketing is fun in college and then very very very sad when you graduate.

Everywhere else students get the mistaken impression they will get some incredible market research job with a fortune 500 when they graduate.  Well, it's not going to happen.  Not even in a great economy, say nothing of a poor one. Fact is, marketing majors are forced to scramble for jobs as assistants, sales positions, and other fields that are not very good.<br>  <br>  Accounting is a better major.  Even if you don't want to be an accountant, the fact is with the coursework you've completed you will be lined up for better jobs than a marketing major would.|`|5BmnSiqUaa	You don't have to choose at all.<br>  <br>  First, you are correct, Marketing is a fun major.  However, businesses fail every day.  It's only then they discover that their excellent marketing drives were not supported by a solid Financing/Accounting backbone.<br>  <br>  Second, Accounting is as dry as the Sahara at noontime.  That's what you'd expect from any scientific discipline - exact and antiseptic.  I do realize that Accounting is part art, thus practitioners have to agree on Generally Accepted Accounting Practice.  Beyond that, it's math.<br>  <br>  Hopefully, at this point, you realize that neither one of these stands alone in successful business operations.<br>  <br>  Given that, recommend you do go ahead and get your CPA and work in that field.  This guarantees an income stream.  This also increases the possibility that you may find an employer who will fund or at least subsidize your higher studies (night sessions) towards a Master's In Business Administration.<br>  <br>  It's in this sense that you don't have to choose.  As executives in training, MBA classes trains you to harmonize business ops:  Marketing & Accounting included.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.
R5UIMBvcaa	I don't consider him to blame at all.  He first ordered them not to land on that island, but they (led by Eurylochus) insisted on stopping there.  He couldn't impose his will on all of them.   However, he made them swear not to harm any of the livestock on the island.  They kept their oath as long as they had other food, but when they were becalmed so long that they ran out of it (possibly a consequence of stopping there, since Circe had warned them not to), they succumbed and killed and ate some of the cattle.  Keep in mind that Odysseus had gone off alone to pray for help and had fallen asleep--put to sleep by the gods, he says  So he didn't know about.the slaughter until it was a fait accompli.  I think it's to his credit that he didn't give in and eat even when he smelled the meat cooking!  Beyond that, there's a sense of fate in the whole matter.  The gods seem to be maneuvering the ship and its crew to that island and keeping them there until they break the prohibition.

l6LUNx9yaa	Unless all you wish to do is be a counselor at the end of 4 years for the average Bachelor's degree, you'll need to go for a Masters. Usually this takes a total of 6 years, however many schools offer an advancement program which will permit this degree after only 5 years. This will permit you to be a psychologist in any standing field that you wish (child, teen, women, PTSD, survivor's, criminal etc.)  <br>  <br>  If you wish to go for your doctorate, that will take 8 years at the least and will give you the qualifications of being a psychiatrist which is the form of therapist that is able to write medical prescriptions for patients in need of them. <br>  <br>  I wish you the best in your path.

uM4wF6mkaa	As a teacher of said courses, here is what I have found:<br>  <br>  Biology is "wordy", it requires a high level of memorization and moderate level of understanding. The math is easy and generally, the chapters are unrelated; ie you can completely bomb one chapter and  ace the next. Read, read, read the book and you'll be fine.<br>  <br>  Chemistry is highly conceptual; it requires a high level of understanding of many tough-to-visualize concepts. You have to picture them in your mind and know WHAT is happening and HOW to apply your knowledge to problems. The math is a little more involved than bio, but not much. The chapters tend to be highly dependent on earlier courses and they build upon each other; ie fail the first chapter, it will get worse in chapter 2. Do, do, do the practice questions and you'll be fine.<br>  <br>  Physics is heavily math dependent. I don't have too much experience teaching this course, but from what i have seen, you need to know your math. You are able to make it through just by knowing your formulas, when to use them and how to manipulate them. hint: algebra. Very little memorization req'd and you can make it through with minimal conceptual understanding. Do, do, do the practice questions and you'll be fine.|`|DIj072Sqaa	It depends what you're better at. <br>  <br>  If you like numbers then Chemistry,<br>  <br>  If you like numbers and finding out how things work then Physics.<br>  <br>  Biology is less mathematical but has more complex (Latin) terms. <br>  <br>  Personally I think the easiest to most difficult order is Physics > Biology > Chemistry but that's just a personal opinion.<br>  <br>  But you also need to consider the career/uni options. If a subject is critical then you must study it.|`|q9BItD25aa	As a physics major.........i would say biology is the easiest.|`|DmWVTT4qaa	Personally, I feel that bio is just memorization of a bunch of different things without really needing a complete understanding of everything.<br>  Chem and Physics on the other hand require more understanding of concepts rather than just memorizing a lot of different facts.  But I think Bio is easier overall anyway|`|hY6zcQozaa	My best grades were always in biology, physic, then chemistry> i could never quite memorize that periodic charts.|`|SSbeC1Xxaa	I always found physics to be easiest, then biology and then chemistry.|`|TUiT6uhpaa	I am a Science teacher...Biology is the easiest of the 3!|`|0xO8Y98uaa	It depends on you, really, and how you think.  But I've always found Biology to be the easiest, then Chemistry, then Physics.  Not everyone feels that way though.  Biology is less mathematical than the other two, that's why I found it easier.|`|bC8r2YTCaa	i think chemistry is the easiest.... physics is the hardest and biology is in the middle... it all depends on the teacher and the person...|`|ORSN4gtcaa	BIOLOGY, hands down, i took AP physics and AP Chem and without a doubt biology is easier

5haljsUJaa	How about this:   It turns out Ms. Strangeworth knows or maybe just senses that the sniper at the funeral killed his own brother.  The sniper senses she knows he did it.  He considers making one more kill (Ms. Strangworth) in order to protect his secret.  When they meet and talk they feel each other out to see who knows what without giving themselves away.  The implication is that if he can stop being a sniper, she can stop being a gossip.  But she's a woman and gossiping is in her nature so it's not clear she's willing to stop even if she senses she's in danger.  Whether the sniper kills Ms. Strangeworth creates the tension in the story.  You could have it end either way.  Also if he does kill her, how will the townspeople react?  Will they be horrified or secretly glad?  Perhaps even openly glad?|`|DjEtdhztaa	If the sniper feels bad about killing his brother, and he meets somebody who knows people's secrets and tries to make them feel bad... what do you think is going to happen? <br>  <br>  Try to imagine (close your eyes or stare out the window for 2 minutes) what it's like to be that sniper, how you would feel.  Then do the same thing trying to imagine what it's like to be miss strangeworth.  <br>  <br>  Then make the two people you imagined meet up.  What would you do, as the sniper? What would you say, as miss strangeworth? There's your story!

zgTsCicNaa	The Secretary Bird is instantly recognizable as having an eagle-like body on crane-like legs which increases the bird’s height to around 1.3 m (4 ft) tall. This 140 cm (4.5 ft) long bird has an eagle-like head with a hooked bill, but has rounded wings. Body weight averages at about 3.3 kg (7.3 lbs) and the wingspan is over 2 m (6.6 ft).<br>  <br>  From a distance or in flight it resembles a crane more than a bird of prey. The tail has two elongated central feathers that extend beyond the feet during flight, as well as long flat plumage creating a posterior crest. Secretary Bird flight feathers and thighs are black, while most of the coverts are grey with some being white. Sexes look similar to one another as the species exhibits very little sexual dimorphism, although the male has longer head plumes and tail feathers. Adults have a featherless red face as opposed to the yellow facial skin of the young.<br>  <br>  ?|`|7428c2399ac39bb8006f047995493c49aa	Please explain.<br>  .

For example, imagine an discussion where there are no biases: it would be anarchy. <br>  One person would say "I think that abortion is good" and someone else would say "Yes but, some people would think it's bad, although I agree that sometimes it's good" and then the other person would say "Yeah, you're right, it's bad sometimes..." We wouldn't GET anywhere... <br>  <br>  A world without opinions would be in a constant limbo, where nothing would ever get done because no one would believe in anything strongly enough to bring about change.

04hTn3vSaa	Well, in high school, you should be taking a lot of science courses...such as AP Biology and AP Chemistry. <br>  <br>  You can't find a "pre med neurology" because there is no such thing. You will need to start off in a pre-med program...Some good ideas for majors would be Neuroscience, Biochemistry, or Biology. <br>  <br>  After you get your bachelors, you then go to med school. One you are in medical school, you will do two years of mostly classroom work. After this, you do two years of internships. Then, and only then, will you actually work in neurology...however, you still won't be an "actual" neurologist. First, you will need to complete a residency in pediatric neurology which can range between 3 to 7 years.

bedi1Scdaa	A simple configuration for a transmission source for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is proposed, which utilizes a series of collimated line sources parallel to the axis of rotation of the camera. The detector is equipped with a standard parallel hole collimator. The authors have demonstrated that this type of source configuration can be used to generate sufficient data for the reconstruction of the attenuation map when using 8-10 line sources spaced by 3.5-4.5 cm for a 30×40 cm detector placed 65 cm from the sources. Transmission data for a nonuniform thorax phantom was simulated, then binned and reconstructed using filtered backprojection (FBP) and iterative methods. It was found that optimum maps were obtained with data binned into 2-3 bins and FBP reconstruction. The activity in the source was investigated for uniform and exponential activity distributions. The effect of gaps and overlaps of the neighboring fan beams was also studied. A prototype of the line source system has been built and the experimental verification of the simulation results has started.

67ea684ce049bd964a876f7c060af3c2aa	Well, I live in California but I guess the test you are talking about is similar to our STAR test, which all students take.<br>  <br>  You can study for these tests, but not significantly. Basically, you just want to brush up on the skills you know you are weak in. You can't study everything, but that's okay because your past years of schooling have prepared you for this test.<br>  <br>  Before the test:<br>  <br>  -brush up your skill, but certainly don't go overboard studying. <br>  -MAKE SURE YOU GET LOTS OF SLEEP! You've probably heard this a zillion times before, but its true. The comprehension and problems you do require focus, focus that is unattainable if you are sleep deprived.<br>  -Also be sure to eat a good breakfast. Don't make it too heavy, because then you might get sleepy. Orange juice is also a great energy boost.<br>  -wear comfy clothes: when you are taking the test, you want all your attention to be on the problem in front of you; not the itch on your back you just can't reach........make sure you're not cold either.<br>  -prepare many number 2 pencils that are sharpened, and put pencil-back erasers on them. <br>  <br>  During the Test:<br>  <br>  -Ask your teacher before hand if you can bring a blank index card. As you answer each question on your bubble-in or scantron, slide the index card down one to reveal the next question. This will help you avoid putting your answer in the wrong slot, which would completely screw up your test.<br>  -If a question is easy, make sure you have completely read it and all its answers before you answer. It's easy to make careless mistakes when you're confident<br>  -If a question is hard, take this procedure:<br>   1) there is often one you can eliminate right away<br>   2) after some thought, you might find another you can eliminate too<br>   3) there are usually two that are hard to decide. Give it your best thought, remember that the people are NOT TRYING TO TRICK YOU, and if you are completely lost, go with your gut. Your first instinct is usually the right one. <br>   4) as you go through your test, star each question you are not absolutely positive about. Put a light asterisk on the side of the question with your pencil. For questions that are very difficult, put two stars. For questions you totally guessed on, put three. Make sure to make your marks very light so you can erase them later.<br>   5) For math questions, be sure to use scratch paper. <br>   6) For reading comprehension questions, read the questions about the story before you read the story so you can see what you're looking for. <br>   7) When you finish your test for the first time, take a deep breath. You're almost done. :)<br>   8) Go back and check your answers, starting with the one star ones. Do a quick check for these, just dedicate a couple seconds to them. As you confirm your answers, erase the star.Then move on to your second and third star ones. Now that you're done with your test, take you time debating and thinking hard about each one. Reread the question. What is it asking? What do the answers imply? Am I approaching it correctly? Think about the problem and if the answer YOU get makes sense. The reason I am saying to do these in the end is because you can often think clearer with the burden of finishing the rest of your test in time. Once you decide on an answer, check it, erase the star, and move on. <br>  9) Now is the time to clean up your test. Darken all light marks, erase all stray marks and asterisks, and make sure your filled in bubbles (or boxes) are clean and crisp. Also, make sure all erased marks are fully erased. <br>  10) Look back at your test booklet and take a look at three questions. Re-do them and make sure the answer is in the correct slot of the book. <br>  11) At last, count all your filled in marks, and make sure the number matches the number of questions, and you only filled in one answer per slot.<br>  12) Relax, you're done.<br>  <br>  Another tip that helps applies to timed tests. Make yourself a plan. If the time is 8:00, you have 50 questions and 60 minutes to do them, give yourself about 40-45 minutes or less to do the questions. Tell yourself that by 8:07, you'll have you're first 10 questions done and so on. Dedicate the time and if you're behind, you'll know you need you work faster. Use the remaining time to check etc. <br>  <br>  Lastly, don't panic during the test. Dwelling over one question ruins you mental focus for the rest. Trust yourself, and you'll do fine.<br>  <br>  Best of luck,<br>                  ????Karishma P. (eight-grade student)
TDfU9Zndaa	I understand the stress you are under but don't give up. Did you ask any family members?? who can help you out a lil bit until the summer comes and you start working so you can pay the loan off. Call the place or company where you took you loan at and explain to them that you are still in school and you do not have the money right now especially with the  way economy is right now. See if you can take out a small loan in your name so put a down payment on the repayment. I also think you should explain to them that your mother is very ill and your really having a tough time right now and you don't have the money right now but you are working on it and that you are still in school. Do try and find a job and know that it is a hard to find a job right now but just trust that the LORD will see you through.    <br>  <br>  I understand where you are coming from I am in the same boat with you. I wasn't able to go back to school because I didn't have the money to go back but I am trying to take online classes now. Until I can start back in the summer and transfer to an in state school. I am hoping my financial aid could be used for the online classes I want to take. I tried to get a consortiu  agreement from my former college but they don't do that. They want me to start paying off my $10,242 tuition from this fall they want me to pay back $1,741 each month until it is paid off and my $4,126 loan from the government I do not have that money right now so I know how you feel. Plus the $20,384 loan I took out last year for my freshmen year I have to start to pay that back soon too hopefully when I finish school and graduate and get settled and start working to pay it back. My parents don't have the best of credit and my older brother and younger sister is in college as well. There schools were more leanyent to helping them out so they could finish out the year. Thank God my brother is finished with college in May so he can maybe help me out a little. As of right now I can't find a cosigner for a loan I barely have hours at work so I am not sure what I am going to do. If you need anymore help or have any suggestions for me please send me an email at clar1127@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  I really don't understand why school is so exspensive people are going into debt trying to receive and education and better thier lives. Just keep holding on the LORD comes right on time. I will pray for you and place you in the pray box at my church and you please pray for me too.

YOPakrItaa	No, it's not hard!  Gym is actually one of the easiest classes you can take! If you take ROTC you are gonna have to wear the green uniform all Wednesdays. Also, during your sophomore you are going to have to take Drivers Ed after school. You won't be in the gym most of the time anyway. <br>  <br>  During your freshman year, you'll do five weeks of gym and then five weeks of health, then five weeks of gym, then five weeks of health and so on. In health you just learn about STDs & the bad effects of smoking and drinking, etc. You'll also do five weeks of swimming( If you don't know how to swim, they teach you so don't worry about that either) <br>  <br>  During your sophomore year, you'll have one semester of Drivers Ed and then the other semester will be Physical Ed in the gym. And hey! Gym's not so bad. It's the only class  where you can actually relax, and you don't have to read or write or do any of the other boring things that you have to do in other classes. <br>  <br>  In gym,you'll play volleyball, basketball, hockey, football, and other games. You don't have to know how to do pushups. My teacher doesn't even make us do any! =) Other teachers do but most people don't know how to do them. Just do your best and you'll be fine. <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that if you join ROTC you're gonna have to be in it for the whole four years that you'll be in Lane. On the other hand, Lane only requires two years of Physical Ed. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped!

There was an unexpected train delay on the six train that prevented me from getting to your class on time this evening. I finally caught the train, but by the time I was able to arrive to the Bronx Campus, it was already 5:50 PM. I read your syllabus from the beginning on the semester, and I am aware of your attendance policy: more than two (2) absences will negatively affect one's grade. I would like to report that I only have two (2) absences to your class; however, I spoke with a fellow student of your class, Yusef, and he mentioned to me that even though unforeseen things do come up, it would be polite to e-mail the professor about the reason you were late for class. Once again, I would like to apologize for being late to your class, and I will not allow this to happen again.<br>  <br>  Just a couple of minor changes! I don't know how to bold, etc., so you'll have to review it.|`|WyCmQBuvaa	I would word it differently.  You didn't miss the class.

H09xgZ3saa	Hi, I actually stuck this thing on my computer and made some editing notes for you.  If you'd like the file I'd gladly e-mail it to you.  I'm not sure if there is a way to upload files to this answer section.  I've been a writer for most of my life.  No, I have never had anything published but I do love writing a good story.  I'm in school to be an english major and though I am most definitely not perfect I should be able to help you at least a little.  I'm a comma splice deviant but you didn't seem to have that particular problem.  I do like this intro and with some corrections I believe it would be awesome.  If you'd like the file from me just let me know.  It's got just a couple of suggestions but I also caught a few typos that you may not have noticed.  If you don't want the file I can always just try to type what I found in to here.  However, it would be way easier to just send the file to you.  I wish you luck and just let me know.  P.S  I'd love to know what's going on in this world you are creating! :)|`|E9Z41ikJaa	Sounds like you've got a reasonably detailed idea of the world for your story. You can use stative verbs (is, was, will be) occassionally, but wouldn't use one in your very first sentence.<br>  <br>  You set up a character who dies at the end of the third paragraph, so what is the central problem of the story and why should I care about it.<br>  <br>  If it is someone else who finds the guy who dies at the end of the third paragraph, I would start your story with your main character and then have a flashback to this scene.<br>  <br>  "He was in such pain" is a pretty weak sentence to describe his condition. How 'bout something like "his shoulder felt like it had been ripped open by a backhoe." At least avoid the stative verb.<br>  <br>  Have you ever heard of "The Elements of Style" by William Strunk. It's a classic writing book and not too large. Very accomplished people have believed it highly helpful. It is available free online, much to my surprise. Here is a link:<br>  <a href="http://www.bartleby.com/141/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bartleby.com/141/</a><br>  <br>  Good luck,|`|AtwxEl9Jaa	Pretty good intro as a whole, very compelling. You have a few issues though.<br>  <br>  In your second sentence, "every pore of most buildings," I think you should change something here. The "most" makes the sentence less dramatic, and you lose some of your flow.<br>  <br>  "gait" not "gate"<br>  <br>  I don't really like the word "aggressor" here (or later). Try and find something more dramatic to fit into the rest of your imagery. "Aggressor" is to analytical. Even something as simple as attacker would be better, although you can certainly find better words than that too.<br>  <br>  But anyway, good job!

Deportation. On August 1, 1944, Anne wrote her last entry in her diary. On August 4, 1944, a truck with German police and their Dutch cohorts appeared at the door. They walked straight to the bookcase, shouted "Open up!" and seized the terrified hideaways. A German policeman ordered everyone to hand over their jewelry and valuables. He took Mr. Frank's attache case, which contained Anne's notebooks, shook the contents out onto the floor, and put in what he wanted to take with him. Anne's papers were left behind. The hideaways were carried off, first to the police station, then to Westerbork. The last transport of Jews from Westerbork took them to Auschwitz.<br>  <br>  10. The End. Mrs. Frank died of starvation in Auschwitz. Mr. Van Daan was gassed. Peter was carried off with the SS and reported missing when the approach of the Russians forced the Germans to evacuate Auschwitz<br>  Mr. Dussel died in Neuengamme. In late October Margot and Anne were deported to Germany, to the concentration camp Bergen-Belsen. This camp was packed with prisoners from other evacuated camps. Anne and Margot both came down with typhus. They died within a short time of each other in March 1945. Mrs. Van Daan also died in Bergen-Belsen. Mr. Frank was liberated from Auschwitz by Russian troops.<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  So Mr. Dussel died somewhere between Aug.1944 and Oct.1944.<br>  I didn't see anywhere that told his age, only that he was an 'elderly dentist'.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|SBCqVhOMaa	Why don't you just read the book and do your own work instead of trying to get strangers to do it for you???

CkIeCNS4aa	If you mean kinetic energy and potential energy, the differences is that kinetic is energy in motion and potential is energy that is waiting to happen.  An example is a pendulum that is swinging (kinetic) and a pendulum that is held still at the top waiting to be released (potential).|`|hRNpGnktaa	Krantic? you mean kinetic. <br>  Let me explain. Potential energy is a spring building up to spring up. Its potential is the energy building inside it.<br>  The kinetic energy is when the spring launches. <br>  Like when you jump.<br>  the potential is when you bend your legs, the kinetic is the movement, when you actually jump and PUSH your legs.<br>  So the potential is leading up, when it gathers the energy, the kinetic is when you let loose and actually use the potential energy gathered

yJSPecgoaa	First of all, you are fortunate that your state allows 12-year olds to work. (In my state, one has to be at least age 14 to get a work permit.)<br>  <br>  Here are some arguments in your favor (i.e.allowing the working age to stay at age 12):<br>  <br>  (1)  Colleges tend to favor applicants who have substantial work experience, because it shows that the applicant is responsible, self-directed, and self-sufficient--qualities that colleges are inclined to view as highly conducive to success in college.<br>  <br>  (2)  Employers nowadays prefer those who have previous work experience.  Even if one has a college degree, if they have NO  work experience, they are currently at a disadvantage compared to those who HAVE work experience (and the employer recommendations to go with it).<br>  <br>  (3)  Teenagers tend to have greater self-esteem if they are given the sort of responsibility that holding a job entails.  Greater self-esteem leads to greater accomplishments, both academic and otherwise.<br>  <br>  (4)  Teenagers tend to engage in fewer self-destructive behaviors when they have the sort of responsibilities that come with holding down a job. <br>  <br>  (5)  Earning their own money enables teenagers to have a better understanding of the value of the dollar, as well as to learn to budget their finances.<br>  <br>  (6)  The earlier a person experiences employment, the better they are prepared for taking on responsibility and learning to earn a living in "the real world."  (Employers nowadays fully recognize--and value--this.)<br>  <br>  (7)  Kids, age 12 and above, tend to have an abundance of nervous energy.  Without being allowed to take on the serious responsibility of a paying job, there is always the danger that such kids will engage in activities that are detrimental both to themselves and to society.<br>  <br>  (8)  Human beings have been shown to be fully capable of handling adult responsibilities by the age of 4 (as per The Continuum Concept, ref. <a href="http://www.continuum-concept.org/book.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.continuum-concept.org/book.ht...</a>  ).  There is no reason whatsoever that 12-year olds, more than 3 times this age, should be deemed too incompetent to hold down a responsible job. <br>  <br>  Good luck with your debate.

Q0HEpw3jaa	What was the original question? It seems a bit too precise to be an SAT essay. Anyways. I would give it a 4 or possibly a 5 on the SAT scale because you focused on a minute topic and didn't relate it back to a broad theme. Also, maybe it's just me but I found your continuous use of his/her to be a bit distracting, almost informal as well. I was a bit confused by this statement as well.<br>  <br>  An average student should not be turned down for scholarships just because of his/her academic standing, they should be given a chance to show their change. <br>  <br>  Also if you use a quote it's good to know it's source instead of a "great man."<br>  <br>  Anyways it's a pretty good essay, but the only other thing is that it's very persuasive and calls for action. SAT essay generally just want you to support a theme, and if that involves calling for action then that is fine.<br>  <br>  Nice job and good luck!

6SstJ0sdaa	A couple of rules that you need to be aware of are:<br>  <br>  1. The structure of a paragraph has a topic sentence, 3 or more supporting details, and a concluding sentence. Your topic sentence should contain one specific idea--in this case you should concentrate on the uses of the IPod OR its side effects, not both.<br>  <br>  2. Your paragraph contains both questions and exclamatory sentences. Avoid using both of these in an informative paragraph. Just say it. No need to ask the reader for opinions or get emotional about anything.<br>  <br>  OK, now here is a suggested re-write of your paragraph:<br>  <br>        The IPod is a famous invention that has the potential for serious side effects. IPods are so popular that many people wear them for throughout the day, from going to school in the morning to playing a sport. Having a listening device in your ears so much can interfere with a person's ability to communicate effectively with others, so their opinions will lack credibility. The volume used by IPod users tends to be at decibel levels higher than the human ear is able to tolerate comfortably, thus resulting in hearing loss. Continued exposure to high decibel levels can eventually cause permanent deafness. IPods can also have a negative impact on a person's economic status. Besides the initial cost of the device itself, the listener must have some method to download music, which often means owning a computer with internet service. Each song downloaded is another cost to factored into the budget. Without careful planning, a listener can overspend on music without responsibly paying fixed monthly expenses. In conclusion, the IPod is an amazing invention that can have side effects that impact a person's communication skills, hearing, and cash flow.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	A famous invention that I would like to talk about is the IPod. An IPod has great side effects. For example, maybe you’re walking home from school, doing math homework, or maybe even playing a sport; what is the most probable device you’re going to pop into your ears? The iPod, of course! In the everyday world, you can see the use of an IPod everywhere! <br>  <br>  IPods may be a good pass time, but they do have their some negative points. hearing loss and price.If you're losing your hearing, an IPod can cause you to go deaf permanently! Companies care about profit, not your health! <br>  <br>  [Put another positive pro here before ending it.]Therefore, you shouldn’t listen to music for long spans of time or else!|`|cOss2lLqaa	in the first sentence, are the ipod should be is the ipod. in the second sentence get rid of the maybe before even playing  a sport. put a period in the second sentence after the word sport, capitalize the word what in the next sentence. the sentence, ipods may be a good time to pass doesnt really make sense.  try, ipods are a good way to pass the time. also instead of saying side effects, try negative aspects. get rid of some include and put a comma after negative aspects and say inclucing, and then list all of them(hearing loss, price) put a period after imagine losing your hearing. capitalize the a after that. you may want to change your closing sentence to: Therefore, you shouldn't listen to music too loudly or for too long, you may regret it.<br>  <br>  also the opening sentence sounds a little 4th grade. you may want to revise that as well.|`|PY5Jfcvraa	A famous invention that I would like to talk about is the IPod. You’re walking home from school, doing math homework, or maybe even playing a sport. What are you probably going to pop into your ears? The iPod! In the everyday world, you can see the use of an IPod anywhere! IPods may be a good time passer, but they do have their side effects. Some of these include hearing loss and the expensive price. A device even as small as an IPod can cause you to go deaf permanently! Companies care about profit, not your health!

Then, leave a little a note or something so that he knows you are thinking of him.<br>  The fact is, the kids will handle best when they know the parents are. If he sees you upset and sappy about it, he will pick up on that and also act that way. Avoid asking questions like "do you miss me, etc' It will make him feel guilty.<br>  So, put on a brave face and do the best you can. Good Luck!|`|2aa6a351069e388eff62776571ad1ec7aa	If you work until 9:30 at night, what time do you go in to work? Is it possible you can occasionally go into his preschool to volunteer in the daytime? He would feel that was very special! Or some preschools don't mind if parents come to eat snack or lunch with their children, if you can.<br>  <br>  Read "The Kissing Hand". <br>  <br>  Send a special toy or blanket from home with him if he's there for nap time. Be sure it "smells" like you!<br>  <br>  Find a talking digital photo frame with a picture of you or you and him and record yourself saying good night.<br>  <br>  Can you call him from work at night? or the webcam idea someone else suggested.<br>  <br>  On the days you don't work, plan a special activity together, especially one he chooses, and mark it on your calendar so it's something you both look forward to.|`|f6v64lmMaa	Sounds like a tough one and a long day for him.<br>  Do you work at the weekend if not you could always give him special time at the weekend and give him mummy time only. Does he have to go into child care 5 days a week maybe you could ask his grandparents to take care of him of sometimes, so that you can meet  him at lunchtime. Or the other alternative get a nanny instead of child care. What time does hubby finish work, I ask as I was thinking that you could maybe meet up for tea or something a few days a week. <br>  Good luck|`|vqVvpiZiaa	you can call him and tell him goodnight. if u can u could also put a webcam on your computer at work and talk to him before bed. If that's not possible make him breakfast in the morning and talk to him.|`|GyPkvQbqaa	Do your best.  That's all you can do.  Don't show him remorse, guilt, anxiety, stress or that you are under pressure.  He will pick up on that - even at 3 years old.  Spend the weekends with him and try to make appearances at his school as much as possible.  **Stay in touch with how he is doing at school**  Good luck!|`|npAV6S81aa	be with him when you have days off<br>  call him when its bedtime<br>  call in sick once in a while<br>  when you off take him somewhere fun<br>  buy him things he would enjoy<br>  i feel so sorry for you i hate being away from my kids|`|i5tOQGgFaa	That is a long day for all of you!  <br>  <br>  I agree with being matter of fact about it and doing what you can to show you care...even if you can't be with him.  Pack him a lunch, if that is an option and put a little picture note in with it.  He'll recognize a heart with the letters Mom next to it to mean Love, Mom.; Even if he doesn't take a lunch...make him a picture to have in his back pack or next to his cereal dish, etc.  Taking time off to meet him for lunch at his school once a week is a good idea.  Giving him a goodnight phone call is a wonderful idea and spending time with him (even if it's him helping you get the chores done) on the weekend will be a big help.  No need to spoil him because you feel bad that you aren't home and I'm hoping that for all of your sakes (including you and your husband) that this is something that will be temporary.  Can you and  your husband work it out to meet for a quick supper once a week as well?  Even if it's fast food?  Can they visit you at the work place?  Can you not take him to school?  Yes, it's a little bit less sleep at night but even the simple action of being up to say good-bye and give him a snuggle is a way to say I Love You.  You can also tape yourself reading books and he can listen to one before he goes to bed at night.  There are many little things you can do.  Good luck in this new routine.|`|014d65a0c1703f4cec009da9b16a4d9faa	why does he need to be there at 6 am? do you go to work that early, and work till 9? every day? this sounds like you are setting your son up for a stressful time if this is every day mom-fri.

He was against anything but the abstinence policy and did not want to take part in the activity. Here is what happened, each person got a ribbon or pin, and had to meet all the other people and you exchanged ribbons. All but two were red and the others were blue, red stood for a sexually transmitted disease, the other didn't. everyone in the room except the dad had "contact" with the disease, he was the only one who didn't.

Therefore do not be in a rush to use anything harsh on your delicate skin  to speed up the reaction -as you could end up getting  an allergy as well as the spots.<br>  <br>  <br>  I would not advise wearing any make- up until the red - rawness has gone. Make up also makes your skin warmer worsening the acne.|`|FHjLB6v2aa	well by this saturday...?<br>  idk. but wash ur face every night with warm water and if you have a cleansing face cream put it on.  <br>  same with tomorrow night.<br>  or what most girls use cover up make up.<br>  i personally don't use that because they say it makes ur acne worse.<br>  but u can use that if you need to get rid of acne by saturday.|`|fgnQ2vLqaa	Wash your face a couple times a day between now and Saturday. Use something like a mild acne wash that contains salicylic acid. That's what most washes have. Do not go to bed with makeup on. Ever. Keep your hands away from your face. And drink plenty of water between now and then. It sure can't hurt.<br>  On Saturday, use foundation, but don't cake it on. Use something simple like Cover Girl Oil Control and dust on a little powder. It will make your breakouts less noticeable. That way you can relax and enjoy your time together.

yXd5J7ikaa	To change 3/7 to a decimal, we first look at the denominator which is 7. From this we can say that 1/7 = .1428. So since we have 3/7, we take the 3 and multiply it by .1428 which is .4284 which is the decimal answer. Now to change it as a percent, get the decimal answer .4284 and multiply it by 100 which is just moving the decimal point to the right by two which becomes 42.84.<br>  <br>  Percentages is out of 100, so 120/100 = 12/10 = 6/5.<br>  <br>  Those are the answers, GOOD LUCK|`|Ba5PVgHMaa	Take 3 divide it by 7.<br>  .43<br>  move decimal two places to the right<br>  43%<br>  <br>  <br>  take 120 and put it over 100<br>  120/100<br>  reduce to<br>  6/5|`|hFAT7aE8aa	3/7= 0.43 divide top by bottom<br>  3/7=0.43=43% convert to decimal then multiply by 100 or u could set up a proportion: 3/7=x/100 it would always be your fraction equal to x/100 because u are trying to find % (x) which is always out of 100<br>  120%=120/100=6/5=1 1/5 percents are always over 100 and then u reduce down to 6/5 by dividing each side by 20 and u get an improper fraction. u can convert that to a mixed # which gives u 1 1/5|`|tDPuXEa0aa	3/7 as a decimal is .43 rounded to the nearest hundredth<br>       as a percent is 43% get it?<br>  <br>  120% = 12/10 = 6/5<br>  <br>  so 120% as a fraction is either<br>  a) 6/5<br>  or<br>  b)1 and 1/5|`|s7ZTN5p8aa	Just divide 7 by 3 to get the decimal, then you can round that to to decimal places and multiply by 100 to get the percent. <br>  <br>  just put 120 over 100 and simplify: x percent is always equal to x/100

As an undergrad, in college, you can major in anything. I was a biology major. College will take about 3-4 years. 3 years if you go to summer school.<br>  <br>  The medical entrance or pre-med requirements that you need to complete while in college are:<br>  Biology (I &II), Chemistry (I &II), organic chemistry (I &II), physics (I &II), Calculus (I &II), English composition (I &II). Extra classes to make your self competitive are : anatomy & physiology, Biochemistry, Microbiology, Statistic.<br>  <br>  You need a cumulative college GPA of 3.5+<br>  <br>  You also need to have research experience and clinical experience. Shadow a doctor or something. My advice to you is become an EMT while you complete your pre-med requirements, this will give you plenty of clinical experience.<br>  <br>  <br>  MCAT: you need to ACE the medical entrance exam known as the MCAT 35+ should be your goal. You take this test in you Junior Year in college. Use Kaplan or another test preparation center. Get the examkracker book it is very helpful.<br>  <br>  Familiarize yourself with this website. They are the one who give the MCAT exam and you will need to apply for medical school through them. <a href="http://www.aamc.org/students/amcas/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aamc.org/students/amcas/</a><br>  <br>  You will need 4 STRONG letters of recommendation.<br>  <br>  Getting accepted into medical school is not easy. People with 4.0 GPA, 40+ on the MCAT, + great letter of recommendation + great clinical experience have a hard time getting accepted. Stay competitive at every step of the process.<br>  <br>  After you get accepted into medical school. Medical school will provide you with the opportunity to explore what type of doctor you want to become. Do well in medical school. Pass your two licensing exams so you can get accepted into a residency program which is extremely competitive. NOT EASY AT ALL. Good luck!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  The anesthesiology  residency program is like 4 or more years long depending on your specialty or subspecialty.<br>  You are looking at least 12-15 years of school after you get out of High school.

Swmd0P2uaa	I had A LOT of trouble with math. I didn't learn my times tables (to memory) until was 13 or so... Some people have trouble remembering details, solving problems in their head- without paper and unfortunately, it seems the best way to understand math it to be able to put a problem together in your head. <br>  <br>  Some things you can do to help her (or her teachers could do) Is let her use a calculator to check her work- she might be missing details, and since the concepts are the hard part for her having a calculator to check the little stuff wouldn't be a big deal. Also, its good to have paper and pencil at all times to work out problems. When she learns how to multiply, try to find a visual representation of the problem. Its also REALLY helpful to write an example of a problem at the top of your paper before you start your homework. For visual learners, you can always go back to the top and look at the process, to make sure you haven't missed a step. If shes really having trouble, I found Sylvan Learning Center to be a great place for extra help!|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	She may not understand the concept of multiplication. You might have to show her an example of how multiplication works: maybe put three piles of two pennies each on a table and show how 3 piles x 2 pennies = 6 pennies. (3x2=6)<br>  <br>  Then she's got to do drills:<br>  <br>  -Get her to make flash cards for each problem. Maybe you and her parents can drill her in them.<br>  <br>  -Show her that if she gets the times table in one direct, she can get it in the other direction. For example: If she knows that 2 x 6 = 12, then she already knows that 6 x 2 = 12.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|r9lfDeRmaa	If she's your friend help her, teacher her how you do it.

They will want to make sure that you are able to keep up with your homework.  If you're too sick to handle the school work, then you can work out an alternative educational plan.  The school is not interested in holding you back.  They would be more likely to want to work with you and your family to ensure that you succeed.<br>  <br>  Did you mean that you have only missed 15 days so far?  That's not much.  They would not be holding you back based on that only.|`|CtwEFHcqaa	If you only missed 15 days in the school year(assuming you mean the average 180 day school year) I don't see what there is to worry about... even why they are having a meeting. Your grades aren't that bad... I'm sure you could do better but nothing that will kill you. I think you'll be fine but I'm not sure, I'm not sure why they would even bother having a meeting.
SIhxrxD3aa	Most classes meet for 50 minutes three times a week.  That is average.  However, you will have classes that meet more than 3 times or for longer.  You might also have labs or studios that meet for 2-5 hours once or twice a week.<br>  As far as what the professor gets done, it depends on the professor.  Some are very long winded and hardly get through anything and others cut right to the chase and cover a lot of material in that time.  It also depends on the level of the course.  Some lower level courses will go slower and upper level courses will move faster.

I hate to say it but I something of an expert.<br>  <br>  I will say every college will have different rules, but here are the rules at the college where I work and I think they are somewhat standard.<br>  <br>  During the first few weeks (weeks 1-3) you can do what ever you want to schedule. Add, drop, replace, switch, any class you want (however it is not wise to do so because if you add and then drop you only get 75% of your money back), still it is your prerogative.<br>  <br>  After the first 3 weeks it becomes increasingly harder to make changes to your scheduled. Speak to the department but honestly after having worked within a department like that for 3 years, no one cares if you find the teacher to be too hard, if they ask for a reason you need to change your scheduled say you were offered a job and the class time conflicts, in this economy if they can help you they will.<br>  <br>  However it may not be in the departments hands. In my school we have entered the period where any changes have to come directly from the Chair of the department and go directly to the head of the registrar, so that is 2 very important people both who have to agree to make it happen. Which sometimes is easy other times.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	I would speak to your counselor and notify them. Maybe you need more time to do  your test?

yXd5J7ikaa	Ok first thing first, the quotient rule is a derivative procedure in the following format:<br>  <br>  When you have a function f(x) in the format division/fraction (like the function you gave us) then you can use the quotient rule by doing this: (Keep in mind that a fraction is numerator/denominator to make the procedure below make sense)<br>  <br>  derivative of f(x) = ((numerator)(derivative of denominator) - (denominator)(derivative of numerator)) / (denominator squared)<br>  <br>  Thats the quotient rule. Now the chain rule is a procedure in finding the derivative of a function that has exponents. For example, f(x) = (3x^2 - 4)^3.<br>  <br>  To find the derivative of f(x) = (3x^2-4)^3, you follow this procedure:<br>        1) Bring the exponent 3 to the front: 3(3x^2-4)<br>        2) Subtract the exponent by 1: 3-1 = 2<br>        3) Put the new exponent into the function: 3(3x^2-4)^2<br>        4) Find the derivative of the part inside the parenthesis: 3x^2-4 becomes 6x<br>        5) Multiply 6x to step 3:  3(6x)(3x^2-4)^2<br>  That's the procedure in using the chain rule. Now use both chain rule and quotient rule to find the derivative of your function which includes a division and functions with exponents. <br>  <br>  Good Luck but take your time since the derivative of that function is going to be quite annoying and tedious.|`|yheSgzcNaa	I don't know about you but for my taste, i'd bring that (5x^2+4)^.5 to the top of the equation and do a multiplication/chain rule.

hgTR8Uzaaa	I agree with some of the other posters.  While what you and the class did was very rude and disrespectful, it was up to the teacher to control you.  It was ultimately his fault that things got that out of control.  He should have been disciplining and punishing you all.  I'm not saying this to make you feel better, or to let you off the hook, but just realize good teachers would have never let things get that bad. <br>  <br>  Look at it this way.  You guys don't act that way in other classes with other teachers.  The students are the same but the teachers are not.  Your other teachers control their classrooms.  The responsibility for that rested on his shoulders.  He probably wasn't cut out for being a teacher. <br>  <br>  But it would probably still be a good idea for you all to write him a letter of apology.  Give it to your principal and he/she can mail it to him.  Then learn from your mistakes and never engage in that type of behavior again.  Take this as a learning experience.|`|nqbcJjHyaa	Nope, you can't get him back. He shouldn't have been teaching if he can't handle a classroom. Some people aren't cut out to be teachers.|`|K2h6M1xqaa	Grade 8, you say?<br>  <br>  Believe it or not, this is a fairly normal time for kids to push boundaries like this; it's when they learn that Authority is not always right by virtue of simply being Authority, and so they push as a natural instinct to see what the *real* boundaries of the world actually are.  Now you know a lot more about it.  You say you learned a lesson?  Well, you did, and a very important one.<br>  <br>  A very similar thing happened in my school when I was in grade 8; my class destroyed two teachers and went through a host of supply teachers.  It wasn't until our principal came in to take over the class that we smacked up against the wall of the social limits.  --Our principal was a HUGE black man with a deep, booming voice, broad shoulders and a powerful build.  He was very smart and very Alpha.  Nobody dared do anything to bother him, and he started the class reading an amazing classical novel from which we learned a lot.  By the end of the year, that class became one of my favorites.<br>  <br>  It sounds to me as though you learned your lesson very gracefully by the end.  You learned about social limits and repercussions, and about how much power you really hold.  And you learned that adults are people who can hurt and be damaged by your actions, and you felt sympathy and love in the end.<br>  <br>  It would probably not be easy to bring him back.  I don't know how that would go; it would probably be very uncomfortable for everybody and that would not be something I'd choose to do.  --Though perhaps that would also be a lesson worth learning, maybe it can be done in such a way that forgiveness and growth can happen.  I don't know very much about that, and the idea even scares me a little, which means it's something I don't know enough about.  You're on your own with that one.<br>  <br>  What you can do in the Now, however, is be thankful for the sacrifice this person has made so that you could learn such a powerful, valuable lesson.  --One which, if you remember it, will allow you to be a very kind and supportive person over the rest of your life.  --Somebody who knows that you hold enormous power but who also knows the value of compassion.  Compassion must be coupled with power, or you will be walked over in your life.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|hHSsMyNpaa	No you won't get him back.  When he got fired he lost his teaching certification.  The positive things you can take out of this is hopefully most of you learned a hard lesson about consequences of your actions.  Learn something about compassion, empathy, acceptance, and tolerance.  Learn how to grow your heart.  Be better people for what happened.   Your old teacher will have gotten fired for nothing if you kids didn't learn something.  It was the last lesson he gave.|`|Ct5LEtgVaa	the least you can do is help him find a another job and support he's family|`|Ky0e3wOhaa	thats really sad. Does anyone know his address or phone number. You guys really should call or write to him for saying you guys are sorry|`|71714b1515fe81ceb604edd886d1c2a6aa	While the actions of your classmates are truly awful and evidence of the worst that children are capable of, a skilled teacher would have had control.  <br>  <br>  When I began my career, I couldn't believe how awful my students were.  As I learned how to control a class, the students have improved.  It really didn't have anything to do with them...it's all about my improved skill at what's called "classroom management."  <br>  <br>  While I feel horrible for your former teacher, he clearly didn't have any.  You could write a letter and get it to him through your school's teacher's union representative (a teacher could point that person out for you).  Getting him back is improbable, but getting some forgiveness will make you feel better.|`|7at1Hyn8aa	That was a horrible thing to do! <br>  I've got to tell you though, that there is absolutely nothing that you can do to get him his job back.  Your teacher, as the one being the adult, should have had the mental strength to get through the horrible things you all did to him.  Unfortunately he did not.<br>  <br>  But, even if you can not get him his job back, you can do something to help him.  You all, and I mean all, should sincerely apologize to him.  Write him or his wife a class letter and be honest. If he does not want to see any of you, and I would not blame him, have another teacher speak to him for you.<br>  You have caused this gentleman great mental harm, and you all should feel guilty, at least for a while.  This is a hard life lesson to learn, but no one can ease your pain, but yourself.|`|R1TkvKV7aa	OMG do you know what happened to the principal of my school? She got fired b/c she thre human waste at these 2 teenage boys who didn't even go to her school. SHE WAS THE PRINCIPAL OF MY SCHOOL! This happened a couple of years ago - but still.

Sadly enough I've seen this happen before. At my school we've had teachers cry, scream, even have a heart attack because of the students' poor behavior. It's a good thing you feel guilty. You should feel it, and you shouldn't stop feeling it for a while. <br>  You can't get him back, but why would you want to? Would making him sit through your harassment and abuse make up for getting him fired? Your whole class should reevaluate the way they treat people unless they want the next teacher to go that way.<br>  My advice would be for each student to individually write him an apology, for a teacher to make sure the letters are sincere and not mean-spirited, and then a school official can deliver them to the teacher.<br>  Maybe next time you'll remember that teachers are people too, and one bad class can ruin someone's love of teaching forever.|`|xngu6kkqaa	Dude. I would shoot you in the face if I was that teacher and you were doing all that to me.<br>  <br>  Cry? Are you kidding me? I would have yelled SHUTUP!!!!

trKgx3Ukaa	I completed a rhetoric course last year through BYU Independent Study. <br>  <br>  Speedback quizzes are usually online multiple choice tests and they are timed. Yes, you can use your notes, but you will have to understand them pretty well because you won't have time to start searching for particular parts to help you answer the question. <br>  <br>  Even with notes, I discovered that the questions test not your memory skills, but your UNDERSTANDING. So, having notes was not awfully helpful. <br>  <br>  The final was dead easy. If you do well on the Speedback tests you will do fine in the final. The correlations are very close. <br>  <br>  By the way, I learned a lot in this course, and it was well worth the hard work for all the assignments ( which were challenging!). <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.
lQIKWXDuaa	East meets west sounds like a party dorm. I really thin the substance free community will probably gives you a better learning environment.

As a recovering addict, I chose that route and found myself with many people that smoked cigarettes, drank alcohol and did weed.  These people were placed on this floor due to the fact that they applied for housing too late and this was the only floor open.  You'll most likely find the same experience.  <br>  <br>  The east meets west option sounds cool because you'll meet so many new people, make new friends, and have new networks to get jobs through (later on) and just get to know a whole new crowd, which is cool!<br>  <br>  Then you should join a couple of clubs too so that you can really feel connected to your school.|`|s7ZTN5p8aa	At my college the substance free living quarters is ironically where all of the druggies are... I would say meet new people if you are good at balancing a social life and studies. You could also just go to the library when you need to do homework so you don't get distracted.
fz107eRDaa	Personally, I am a PowerScore fan (<a href="http://www.powerscore.com)." rel="nofollow">http://www.powerscore.com).</a> I took their LSAT class back when I was prepping and now teach there. <br>  <br>  The thing that initially made me a PowerScore fan was using the LSAT Bibles. Those books were better than the other books I tried, and they were geared to a much higher intellectual level. I figured that if the books were that good, the course would be better too. When I took the class, it helped me a lot, but I'll admit up front that it was hard work. For example, there is a lot of homework in the course, and the expectation is that you will get through a lot of different materials including drills and discussions, problems sets and tests. Training with all those materials makes sure that come test day there are no surprises and that you know exactly what to do in each situation. So, for me, what makes PowerScore good are the materials, and the teachers who convey the ideas. <br>  <br>  There is a service called Princeton Review that provides LSAT preparation. I had friends who took the course, and they didn't hate it, but they didn't love it either.|`|Vk1FoxsRaa	Barron's book
aQLIUizbaa	Well, I don't know if this will help you, but here's my two cents on this:<br>  <br>  Nowadays, more girls are leaning towards role models that are pretty/thin/rich, etc. They focus less on their personality and what kind of people they are, and pay more attention to their physical appearance, which shows us that society is rapidly shifted to becoming vain and obsessed with thinness and beauty. <br>  <br>  That's only one idea, all I could think of. I hope this helps, and good luck with your essay!|`|Mlx5j4zFaa	Do michael phelps and how he's an awesome role model|`|7f2gzi3Yaa	Well you could talk about the role models younger girls tend to have. For example, instead of looking up to a smart woman who made a difference by helping out people in need many girls choose to look up to actresses such as Paris Hilton and want to be like her. Paris Hilton is not a positive role model as she is not very intelligent, spends way too much money on her looks, does not care about education and others and also made a sex tape. Unfortunately not many people will look at someone such as Mother Teresa and say they want to be like her. Instead they'd look up to people in Hollywood and consider them role models. This means that our society is obsessed with outer appearances and beauty, and not with important stuff such as helping out others in need. When adolescents look up to such bad influences they will grow up worrying about gaining an extra pound or the size of their breasts. If all this energy was used for other things such as charity work, it could help a lot of people out. I hope I helped :)|`|AA12181642	i think the question is silly :) but here an option: <br>  <br>  think of a hero, or a role model - it could be a writer, a president, a UN secretary general, a soldier, a housewife, a mother, a single parent.. - depending on the hero - lets say the hero is a woman - you can say it reflects the efforts that society makes to emphasize on gender-equality. If its with a migratory background you can consider the society to reach towards acceptance and integration of "others" into their own society and so on.. <br>  <br>  and the lack of heroes might reflect the lack of ideals in a society, because heroes or "role models" usually reflect that ideal person we worship and want to be like - someone we are not, but someone we support, someone who can help us, someone who sets an example for all of us.. <br>  <br>  define "hero" first - who needs them? do you? what does the hero you chose represent? what are his tasks? achievements? <br>  what does his/her actions mean and represent to society? <br>  is it fictional? is your hero, a hero for everybody?<br>  think of hitler.. hero for many nazis.. but the "devil" for others!!! <br>  Obama is certainly not the hero of the most conservative republicans ;) and the police might be a hero for some, but for others maybe an abusive person who happens to have authority ..<br>  <br>  good luck!
SDMqpoFXaa	I can offer you some help. This is my opinion of the aforementioned quotation.<br>  <br>  When E. Boyle said, "Too many young people are motivated by selfish interests; they lack concern for anything beyond themselves." Although this quotation was said in a time much different from our own, I believe that it still pertains to teenagers today.<br>  <br>  Teenagers today are brought up to always help others who are in need, however most never heed this advice. Adolescents are too distracted with different apparatuses which refrain them from thinking about anything other then themselves. Somewhere along the line, they get the Darwin idea of the "survival of the fittest." Teenagers too often believe that you have to rise above their peers in order to seek success.<br>  <br>  Teenagers also believe that if a situation doesn't involve them directly, then it shouldn't involve them at all. Many are too frightened to venture outside of their comfort zones to lend a helping hand to those who really need it. Adolescents should not refrain from helping their peers, but instead should be open to accept advice and lend a hand.|`|paOewdzzaa	You've got to learn how to start thinking for yourself. What do you think he means? Can you think of examples that support his point? Can you think of things you've seen that prove the opposite? <br>  <br>  Practice freewriting or brainstorming techniques (google them if you don't know what that means). Especially if you're in college, the sooner you start taking care of yourself and stop relying on strangers online to do your homework and give you ideas, the better. <br>  <br>  I am giving you a hard time because you're not really asking for a conversation about ideas you have -- you're asking for people to do the work for you.

Some believed women were incapable of writing a great book, because all of the great books recognized in their time were by men.<br>  <br>  Jane is saying that this does not mean women can't write a great book.  Because women had not been allowed to write in earlier ages, and were consistently less educated than men in her age "the pen has been in their hands" (it has not been a fair contest).  "I will not allow books to prove anything" is saying she rejects the argurment that because it had never been done it cannot be done.|`|mbXHkf1maa	This is where Anne Elliott is discussing with Captain Harville whether men or woman are more constant in love.  He says all the books he's read say women aren't constant.<br>  <br>  So Anne is arguing that because of their better access to education, men get to write all the books, so books can't be taken as a reliable source on the subject of men vs. women.<br>  <br>  Here's the context:<br>  <br>  Captain Harville: "... I do not think I ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon woman's inconstancy.  Songs and proverbs, all talk of woman's fickleness.  But perhaps you will say, these were all written by men."<br>  <br>  Anne: "Perhaps I shall.  Yes, yes, if you please, no reference to examples in books.  Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story. Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has been in their hands.  I will not allow books to prove anything."<br>  <br>  PS: READ THE CONTEXT. The quote is not remotely about whether women can write great books, as claimed below. Anne is questioning whether books written by men can be trusted in what they say about women.

This deduction can reduce the amount of your income subject to tax by up to $2,500 in 2008.  Check out the link for the IRS details.<br>  <br>  You should have received a statement from each loaner in the mail by the end of January, stating how much loan interest you've paid for tax purposes.  You should continue to be able to deduct the student loan interest in future years.|`|LNeSlzCCaa	you can write the interest off in taxes|`|TDfU9Zndaa	I believe you can try and see if the drop the interest rate down a little bit more so you can have more time.
