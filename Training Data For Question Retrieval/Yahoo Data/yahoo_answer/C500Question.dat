20090204231210AAs7nEs	Health;Mental Health	Effects of 'work stress' upon your epilepsy?	For those of you that have epilepsy, what has been your experience with 'stress' at work either making you have more, or new types, of seizures?      I have had it 'diagnosed' for 20 years, I think I have always had it.      Anyway, 'how' has your epilepsy changed 'over time'.      I am assuming that like me, you have been able to maintain fair to good control over the episodes with proper medicine.  ...I Know that some have it so sever that they can not live a life of 'semi-control'.      However, mine has 'slowly' gotten worse as the years have gone by.  ...more 'types' of seizures, and more freguent.      The nature of my work is one of high stress constantly. I use to work 70 to 100 hours per week, with an overall average of 65 hours per week  - for years, with very high stress on top of that.      After about 16 years, I had to cut back my hours to less than 50 per week, and worked less if I could.      During the last two years, high stress has caused me to have new types that directly effected my job, and I voluntarily quit work about six months ago due to it.  I am thinking about filing for Social Security Disability, I am nearing retirement anyway.  But I can not find work in my field that I have done for the last 30 years.        It is affecting my short term memory also, so that doesn't help when I am learning something new - I work in the high tech field as an engineer.      So, again - how has your epilepsy changed over the years, and what have you had to do to cope with the changes?      Thanks for your responses.

I'm at an incredibly low point and just hoping someone out there has a few words of encouragement to get me through this. I suffer from and autoimmune disorder and it has caused my to miss a lot of my graduate classes. The disease itself is bad enough, and I always said that I wouldn't let it control my life but it has. Today I basically got kick out of school because of my poor GPA. I'm 24 years old, this was my dream, this was what I had been working for my entire college career, now I'm in debt $30,000 and I didn't get my masters degree. I am so lost. My family isn't really speaking to me because they felt I was making the wrong decision by persuing an education rather than sticking with my ex-husband, who left me when I decided to do this.       I'm now running the risk of losing my apartment and I have no idea what to do with my life. I'm not trying to be like oh poor me or anything I just need some words of encouragement. I feel very alone right now. Any comments would be greatly appreciated. Please nothing mean, I can't handle that right now.

Starting this year, I'm getting a little better at waking and getting up early in the morning. Here I define 'waking' as opening one's eyes and becoming conscious, out of the dreamy, drowsy state. 'Getting up' would then be actually getting out of the bed and start moving actively. The more ideas I can get the better. I'm sure many of you at one point or another have faced this struggle in your lives. A followup question to this would be, "How do you make this morning routine into a habit and how long would it take to get used to this?"

And while selecting these do you give attention that you really need a balanced food for a good health, i.e. YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT or you just dont care this and  eat simple food to live a simple life with high thinking.  Think again.   You really need a good food,i.e. carbohydrates, proteins and fat.  Day time, you need more energy, so you need to eat maximum carbs and less proteins and fat but during dinner is its opposite because night you need to sleep and don't require much energy and therefore, more proteins and less carbs and little fat.  Carbs gives you energy, proteins are good for bone mass and muscle health and fat for hair/nail growth and for maintaining skin's youthfulness and beauty,etc..  I will like to hear frank comments from all friends   Non-vegetarian  can get proteins/fat from meat, poultry, fish, egg and vegetarian can get proteins/fat from seeds, nuts, yogurt, soya milk, tofu, milk products, beans, etc.  Please send frank comments.  Thanks again.

20090205041255AAd9ijQ	Health;Alternative Medicine	I will be reporting on Sodium, Potassium, and Calcium in my Pharmacology class...?	I wasn't really able to clear it out with my professor on what to report on with regards to these three. One of our last topics, though, was about drugs for neuromuscular disorders. So I think it has to do with the roles of the three in muscular contraction. But then our next topic is phramacotherapy in relation to the cardiovascular system. I believe that my report also has to do with this. Another thing is I remember my professor telling me about to "just make a tables". In addition to that, I think it has to do with "blocking/inhibiting and/or stimulating" actions of drugs when it comes to sodium, potassium, and calcium. Also, I remember that the regulation of sodium and calcium were discussed in our topic about anti-seizure drugs. I thought I understood at that time, but I'm very wrong. So I really need the help. Here are my quesitons:      1. Are the roles of Sodium, Potassium, and Calcium for Skeletal and Cardiac contraction the same? it not, what are the differences?      2. Is it proper to connect the dynamics of these three in relation to the topics of neuromuscular, cardiovascular, and seizure?      3. Can anyone simplify for me the process of muscle contraction with regards to sodium, potassium, and calcium?      4. How do I make my report into a table like how my professor told me?      She said that I could easily do my report in 5-10 minutes. I really need the help. Thank you very much in advance.

20090205041549AAZVWtb	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	Please help! really worried I have lymphoma?	I am a 22 year old female, just looking for some advise and/or reassurance. This is about the 3rd question I have posted recently in realtin to my lymph node.   I found a painless swollen lymph node under my left armpit 2 weeks ago. It is about 1.5cm in size and is moveable. It is also not visible from the outside. I rang and spoke to a doctor when I found this, as I googled my symptoms which terrified me! The doctor told me not too worry, leave it alone and check it in 2 weeks time and if it's still there go in and see her. I wasn't very good at leaving it alone as I have been so worried about it (not sure if this could prevent it returning to it's normal size)    Anyway yesterday was 2 weeks and it's still there so I went to the doctors. The doctor gave me a breast examination and said it feels ok and she is not particullarly worried about it. She told me again to check in 2 weeks as it should go down. If still there in 2 weeks, she will look into it further. I cannot stop worrying about it, and spend hours searching for different possibilites on the internet. I have no other symptoms, except occaisionslly I have a twitching feeling (which I can only describe as a baby moving) in my lower stomache. It is not at all painfull, and mainly happens at night. Could this maybe be my spleen swelling?    Everyone I know tells me I am being overly paranoid, which I do think I suffer from slight health anxiety, which has got worse since I've had my son, who is nearly 9 months. I just can't bear the thought of leaving him, and know I prob wouldn't have been as worried before.    Anyway, I'm sorry for the long post! Just wanted to make sure I didn't miss anything out. Any help or advise would be much appreciated. Thankyou for reading.

20090205051237AAkBLnC	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Immniosuppressant options for Churg-Strauss Syndrome.?	My husband (67) has Churg-Strauss Syndrome.  He is allergic to most of the immnio-suppressants that are normally used to help combat this illness (Cytoxin, Immuran and Rituxin).  He is currently taking 100mg of prednisone daily.  The last couple of days around here have been....challenging.  He has a new episode beginning, not that he has completely healed from the last one.  And our doctor has suggested raising his prednisone level again.  Lord, I can't decide if this disease will kill him or me.        The maintenance dose of prednisone has already caused severe damage to his kidneys.  His glucose levels are so irratic now, I can't imagine adding another 20 or 50 mgs to this.  They have caused bilateral DVTs in his legs.  He has chronic CHF.        Anyway....my question.  Are there any other immniosuppressants available?  Or should we try injectible steroids?        Additionally.  He is spilling 400 times more protein than he should into urine.  His blood pressure is still way too high, even though he is on three bp meds.

I recently started exercising quite regularly and decided that running on a treadmill was a good way to go about losing weight quite quickly. I am a 21yr old female and overweight at 90kg for my 5'7" in height.       I started to experience a sharp pain down my shins when I'd stop running and rest doesn't really seem to alleviate it. I thought at first maybe I was just too heavy and my bones and muscles were struggling with my weight, but then I read somewhere that this was a common problem for runners and was called "shin splints"?      I just wondered if anyone knew much about this and what could be done to prevent it (other than not running and rest) and also if maybe I was only experiencing this because of my weight?      No silly answers please, many thanks.

It came back with an elevated heart rate.  I also had an echocardiogram and an MRA of my chest, which he said "looked great!"      Since then, he has been trying to figure out the cause of my fast heart rate.  I did blood work, have a urine sample, and did a tilt table test to see if my fast heart rate was being caused by postural changes.  My tilt table test was normal.      My urine sample showed that I have a high cortisol level, which is an indicator of stress.  My blood work showed I have an elevated ESR level, which is an indicator of inflammation somewhere in the body.      My doctor just put me on a VERY low dose of beta blockers, which he says will slow my heart rate and make me feel less anxious.  He has also referred me to a rheumatologist to check me for autoimmune disorders (like arthritis) which could be causing the inflammation.      Anyone else have these same symptoms?  I am getting very frustrated and I just want to get to the bottom of this!!        I have also heard that an elevated cortisol level can also cause a faster heart rate - is this true??

We are both in our twenties and I have a child from a previous relationship. It's coming up on a year since we have been trying and we're still not pregnant.

Because of his age, and other existing health problems, he is not receiving any chemo or radiation treatments.

I have asked several of his doctors for a "time line" and the only fairly clear answer was that my family should have a consultation with hospice in the coming weeks. If there are any doctors or other health care professionals reading this post, is the "time line" of 6 months from diagnosis given at cancer.org or melanoma.com fairly accurate? Many thanks, Prof.G

Second of all I've noticed improvements, when I was 11 I couldn't pull it down at all, but now I can its just tight, so im hoping it will fix.     Any ideas? or anyone with the same problem?

I floss and brush my teeth everyday. I also chew mints and gum which don't help at all. I don't know what to do advice? What job to get with my bad breath? I also brush, my tongue until I gag and I don't eat garlic or onions or anything out of the ordinary. Also my throat smells.   Advice?   Thanks!

20090205060700AAPd50P	Health;Mental Health	Psychologist/Psychiatrist?	Hi.   I was wanting to maybe persue a career in psychology, but the pay isn't really very good.   My question today is, can I go to school and become a Psychiatrist, but still do the stuff psychologists do.   I don't know how to explain it really.   Like...a hybrid.   Be a psychiatrist and be able to prescribe medications and stuff, but offer therapy as well?   Also, I'm in Australia; so how long do I have to go to school for? And do I have to have finished year 12 at school?   I left in year 10 :o)   Please get back to me!
20090205053225AAyPMiU	Health;Women's Health	Help me please! I'm worried!! (girls only)?	Last november I went to the doctor as i thought i was suffering from depression, he asked me lots of questions and decided to put me on the contraceptive pill for a few months cos it sounded like the problem was hormonal.   so, i took it but he said if i start to feel worse, stop   so i stopped after a few weeks (the course was 3 months long) and i had a period. this was in december and i havent had one since.   Is it because of the pill? i only took it for 2 weeks (on and off - i hept forgetting) and before that i had periods regularly and often.   I'm 16 and a virgin and i had my first period when i was 11 if that helps   Thanks xx

I know it's actually the herpes virus (the non-genital kind) so it makes sense that you would feel sick.  I can't stand it though and I'm getting 2-3 outbreaks a month.  Doctors have suggested medications that they actually treat regular herpes with (like VALTREX) but those give me worse headaches than the coldsores do themselves.  And the coldsores are very unsightly.  All I can do is take tylenol and apply Abreva (which btw, I go through 2 tubes an outbreak so I spend about $40X3=$120 a month on!).  What do you do?  Are there "herbal" or natural remedies?  HELP!

So how do I know if Itll be easy to come out this time if ive only been on my period a couple times?

20090205062952AAKWT7Y	Health;Women's Health	My gynecologist said it's pretty uncommon for a healthy 23 year old woman to get a fibroid...is that true?	In 2007 I was told after an Ultrasound that I had a small intramural fibroid in my uterus and to just follow up in a year.  I was really skeptical and asked my normal doctor and she said to make sure I stayed on birth control. I now, after doing my own research, realize she was wrong b/c that only helps the fibroid to grow. In November of 2008 I went to a different doctor and she said it is really uncommon for someone my age and of my health to develop fibroids, especially because I haven't had any children or been pregnant.  Upon another ultrasound I found out it grew 14% in the past year and is now appx. 2x2x2 cm.  I have also gained a LOT of weight, though my lifestyle is quite healthy and full of exercise.  My gynecologist said it very well may be due to the fibroid.  My questions are (sorry it took so long, I just wanted to provide a lot of detail): is weight gain normal, should I get it removed (I realize that no one can really say for sure except my doc and surgeon on this), and what are the chances of me being able to get pregnant with the fibroid.  I should also note that I was told that before I can get pregnant I'll have to get it removed anyway because it's position may very well keep me from getting pregnant.  Finally, I should also disclose that I have extreme pain at times from the fibroid that I don't want to elaborate on in here.  I'm just hoping someone can give me a little more info about fibroids than I've found in my own research.

20090205055840AATB9XE	Health;Diet & Fitness	Do you think this form of dieting is ok?	I have a lot of trouble sticking to calorie restrictions long term, but I can go a few days at a time. So I was thinking, is it ok to restrict your calories to 1200-1400 a day for around 3 or 4 days, then for 3 or 4 days eat a normal calorie intake? I don't mean binge eating or eating junk food, but just to give your body a rest from being on caloric restriction. I also thought that maybe that way you would keep your metabolism going strong because it wouldn't go into starvation mode.      Also, it would work out that over a period of a week, you ate lower calories overall, and isn't that what matters in weight loss?      Do you think this would be safe and effective?

Here is a little background information. I've been on and off "anorexic" since I was 13(now 18). I'm actually a normal weight at the moment(125lbs) and I am 5'9. I don't binge and purge, I simply just do not eat. I have bipolar disorder type 2, a general anxiety disorder and ADHD as well. I am currently taking(and abusing) Adderall, Wellbutrin XL for depression, Lamictal for mood swings and Ambien for insomnia.       I started taking a multipack of vitamins and minerals containing 21 vitamins and minerals, enzymes, Concentrated Vegetable Enzymes, Omega-3 and Omega-6, and oils. Are these vitamins going to do any good for me regarding hair loss, poor nail beds and other negative things following Anorexia?

20090205053554AAq2xrJ	Health;Other - Health	For the first time in over 3 years, I puked this morning.?	To much information? Sorry. Around 2am this morning I woke up and felt sick to my stomach (literally), and after a lot of bathroom visits and attempts to fall back asleep (I have to get up at 5:35 for school), around 3:30 or so I puked up a lot of orange vomit. Afterwards I felt ok, but I still couldn't get to sleep. At 5 I puked up more orange vomit. I told my mom why I was staying home and she obviously agreed. I finally managed to get a bit of sleep, from like 6-7:20am. At 8 I puked up something green (?), which might be bile, since I didn't eat any vegetables in the past days. And then I was dry heaving.       And here I am. My stomach is still sore. I feel like crap. My little sister had to be picked up from school early yesterday because she was throwing up, and on Monday morning my dad said he had the stomach flu (but he still went to Ohio that same day for construction work). Could I have caught this from them? At school a lot of my friends have been absent sometime during the week, saying they were sick.      Umm my question is, do I have the stomach flu? Do I need medicine, or will it go away on it's own? I don't want to miss school again tomorrow, for various reasons, but I don't want to go if i'm sick.

When I was five years of age, my parents after many years of not understanding what was going on with me (I was hyper, slept 2 hours a night, ran into walls constantly, couldn't sit still) through a kindergarten teacher was able to take me to the doctor that diagnosed me with severe ADHD.  I was put on ritalin and taken off around the time I was in middle school.  My parents didn't realize that even though the hyperactivity was not there (at least not as much) that I still had trouble remembering homework assignments and concentrating in school.  I graduated high school, went to college and graduated that too, and I am now a 29 year old stay at home mom.  The issue of ADHD has arisen again because I believe my son may have it (both his father and I had ADHD) but could I possibly still have it? I've always put things off, and been impulsive my husband often refers to me as careless because I will set glass thing on the edge of a counter or shelf (only for it to fall and break), leave dishes in the sink overnight (at least I washed them off), parked our car next to a flooding creek even though they told me to go to his sisters house and stay the night (I really wanted to be home) that night I also walked through a flooded creek and field (lucky I wasn't swept away), so do these things sound like I have impulsive ADHD? There are so many more stories I could tell but don't want to bore or excite anyone. Please help!

I put my first patch on at around one o'clock this morning [because I had been debating all day whether to start now or on Sunday, and I had to finally decide within 24 hours].  Does this mean I have to change my patch every week at one o'clock in the morning on a Thursday or can I make my official 'change patch day' Wednesday night?

20090205063645AAywoZ2	Health;Mental Health	Does Anyone Know What Mental Illness These Symtoms/Behaviour Relate Too?	Exsperiencing Highs & Lows - Mood Swings (some times realy happy or verry angry annoyed frustrated- periods in the middle.    Looking to buy anything - usually unnecessey/unusual/weird and therefore a waste of money leading to debts.    Puttin on a strange face while behaving oddly. This loooks very worrying. Talking excessively about pointless uninteresting things to people and giving completely unecessery information to people about himself, speaking in an illogical way, making excuses up that have no relation to what has happened or what he has done or to back up what he has said.   Constantly needing to do things, is going to a club to buy a couple of drinks regualry then deciding to stop drinking at all then going back to the same- where as before hardly ever drinking. (Although the alcohol consumption is not worrying in anyway) Going to quiz nights, buying lottery tickets, deciding to become a 'budder' - buying goods and researching beliefs, buying tarrot cards, becoming interested in the chineese, buying an unusual beaded bracelet aswell as a metal one . . . i could go on but none of the things he did before becoming ill. Although the whatever mental illness he has, has became betterr now although all things i mentioned above are what he is currently like.  He seems not to be improving much more at the moment though. Before this a number of strange things happened whish i won't go into detail about and he was sent to a phycriactic ward. (He beleived the ordinary hospital was made up and the doctors and nurses were actors like in holby hospital he believed some of our family were 'in on it' also at one point thinking i was communication with him through my mind and telling him what to do. He also thought that homeless people were his guardian angels at one point and protecting him. Getting sent home from work after shouting odd things in the middle of town whish he saw as a joke- when he says anything is a joke it is normally not in anyway funny to anyone else. He has been trying acupuncture aswell as herbal remedys and refuses to use any treatment doctors have offered him. This started as paranoya shortly after starting a facebook site where he gave his name and adress out to someone whish was now beieved to be not who they said they were. He became paranoyed and thought people were constantly following him. We are unsure whether this was actually the case but i believe it was not. He now understands that the hospital was real and homeless people are not guardian angels and that the rest of what had happened was weird although can not remember some of the things that happened while he was dillusional. While out with family he often goes off somewhere to the toilet or to a shop without telling anyone where he is going (we do not believe he always needs the toilet when in hospital he 'went to the toilet' 5 times. He uses excuses like 'it would be rude to tell you i was going to the toilet.'
20090205063754AAHCvY0	Health;Diet & Fitness	Exercise routine recommendation?	Here's my profile:   24 years old, 5'10", 125lbs   I had a wellness physical recently, and all my stuff checked out near perfectly (blood pressure, blood work, BMI, diet, etc etc).  It was for health insurance at my job, and emloyees were scored.  I received a very high score.      I'm young though, and have good genetics.  I'm active at my job all day, but I wouldn't call it exercise exactly.  I don't sustain a rapid heartbeat for longer than a few minutes at a time.      My mom has an exercise bike.  I've started using it.  I'm doing a constant 15mph for 15 minutes.  It comes out to be about 3.5 miles.      I have a very fast metabolism - I am NOT doing this for weight loss, and I don't want to lose any weight.  I want to do it to be physically fit, have a healthier heart, and to have more endurance.      What do you recommend for a person like me?  More?  Less?

20090205071646AAY1xvJ	Health;Women's Health	Endocrinologist..pcos...boobs.… help?	Ok..So I went to see my endocrinologist yesterday about my pituitary tumor.My prolactin levels are back to normal...he's checking agian to make sure..but the reason they were high was from a bipolar medication called risperdal to begin with and I've been off that med for quite a few months. Anyways he checked my breasts to make sure they weren't leaking milk since people with my sort of tumor have that sometimes. And nope they weren't.      But he did say that they were really firm..he was surprised they were real and he guessed it was because he's use to touching older womens breasts and younger womens are usually more firm. ANYWAYS...he said they seemed full as if I was pregnant so he wanted to do a preg test just in case.       What's that about? I mean I want a baby more then anything but I havn't really had a period in ALONG time...and I don't think it's because I'm pregnant, my boobs hurt but I think it's cause the bras I wear or something. I don't understand how could he think I might be pregnant when my periods hardly ever come? I told him this too!      Then he said if I'm not pregnant he might put me on something called metaformin or something because he has a feeling I could have PCOS.      So my question here is...how does metaformin work to make your periods regular? and how the heck could he think I'm pregnant just by feeling my boobs! Could it possibly be from the prental vitamins I was taking?

It looked like a black moth, smaller than a 1/4 inch. Obviously this insect carries a lot of poison, because I have thick welt that wraps around my ankle (place of bite). The area is red and swollen, hard to the touch. This bite is VERY itchy and burns a bit.       Any ideas on what it is... I can't find any pictures online from its description.      It is not a deer fly, its much smaller.  All I could see was tiny paper like black/brown wings

20090205084642AAJx9n3	Health;Diet & Fitness	Faking the desire to lose?	I have always been a little chubby and my older sister has always been thinner.  However, my sister has gained some weight, and she's a little chubby, but I still weigh more (because of my height).  Even though she is chubby, she flaunts the fact that she weighs less on the scale.      Whenever I decide to diet, she tries to sabotage my plans by buying me candy all of the time.  If that doesn't work, she'll refuse to eat for a few days, etc.  She is not interested in actually losing weight.  Several times, I have tried to get her to exercise and diet WITH me, but she refuse.      However, she'll resort to childish methods to ensure that I weigh more than her (by buying me more food) or starving herself for a few days to take a little water weight off.  (I know what you're thinking, but when my sister gives me a lot of food, my mother plays right into her game and accuses me of being mean if I refuse to eat it all --- then my sister plays right into that by pretending to cry if I don't eat it.)      How do I get out of this and why is my older sister behaving so childish?

20090205075828AAkw90W	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Rhomboideus Major Muscle might be causing my back pain. Can someone help me?	I have been having back pain since I was about about 12-14 years of age. Now its just hit it's peak. Over the past 2 years, I have had this pain in my back, it is generally in two places exactly opposite of each other. It's not under my shoulder blade but a little over to the side closer to my spine and just a little bit higher where the soft spot is. Most of the time its on my right side. So if you go where my shoulder blade is and head down under it, and over to the left near the side of my spine and up a little and to the right there is a soft spot, and it throbs and hurts. It makes me feel like my back needs to be cracked. Sometimes I get it on the left side exactly opposite of that exact spot. After that, the large muscle I think its called the Latissimus Dorsi becomes the same way, it gets very swollen and throbs, and it feels like my back needs to be cracked. I cant crack my back however. Not even a Chiropractor seems to be able to crack it. The pain is getting worse each day, and some nights I cant sleep. Is this a nerve problem, or do I have a severe condition? They have done x-rays on me, but it all comes out negative. I tell them the problem isn't in my spine, its not a bone issue, its my muscles or nerves.They dont listen, they just say, ohh your just having minor back spasms. I bet if I had Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield they would listen. Hell they would probably take notes, and give me a shiatsu massage too! The hospital gives me nothing but Motrin 800mg which is about as useful as sugar pills. I have been placed on Vicodin, Percocet for it, and went as far as Oxycotin, but then my body numbs out everything goes numb EXCEPT I can still feel the throbbing in my back. Can anyone tell me if this is a condition. The name of it, and what I can do to make it better. Someone I know suggested Cortisone Shots to my back.

I had a Mirena IUD birth control put in .. i was having some severe cramping so i took extra strength Ib profen everyday for about 3 weeks.. after the cramping had stopped I discontinued using the Ib profen .. and within a couple days i was in a lot of pain.. abdominal .mostly on the right side and top .. so i went to the ER and they kept me there for a couple of hours ..ran a few tests.. checked my IUD ..said it was just fine..and told me I had damaged my stomach lining from taking so many ib profin and that it could possibly be a small ulcer.. they gave me zantac and sent me on my way.. The zantac has helped with the burning stomach when i eat and such .. but the abdominal pains (which feel like a walking cramp but much worse) haven't subsided and have gotten worse.. and now my left side hurts as well. Im weak ..and tired all the time I have no appetite really.. the bleeding from the birth control hasnt stopped yet but is showing signs of going away now.........Ive lost 15 pounds and im a small girl in the first place usually 115  so now im getting really scared.. I look unhealthy  Im pale ..sometimes i cant stand up straight because my stomach hurts so bad.. I just started a new year of school and i cant mess it up and i feel horrible everyday! I plan to go back to the ER tonight because im so scared from losing the weight and i cant deal with the pain getting worse.. I just want to feel like myself again! I think on top of the damaged stomach lining and cramps from the IUD that something else is worng.. maybe even a reaction to the IUD   i dont really know  .. but SOMETHING is not right! HELP
20090205074258AA8JwRG	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	HELP NEEDED | Need to re-align Pelvis - what type of DR. should I visit?	Have a herniated L4/L5 and I am suspecting that the cause has something to do with a misaligned pelvis (X-Ray shows they are misaligned).     CLUE: The the back right heal of EVERY shoe is noticeably more worn.  What does this suggest? (Looking from behind, would the Hip  be tilted to the right side or left?)  The right side is the side with the sciatica type pain as well.  Would the right doctor to see be a PODIATRIST; PHYSIATRIST; ORHTHO SURGEON or a CHIROPRACTOR?  I am afraid of surgery- often makes things worse and also of a Chiro- my thought is that they are happy to crack a back but it might aggravate the herniated!) but I would think correcting the hip alignment is important BUT I mentioned this to the physiatrist last year.  I asked if a heal lift could be used to offset the lean and she said NOT to use a heal lift to correct it as it could aggravate the irritation that the herniation is having on the sciatic nerve.  Furthermore she did NOT suggest seeing anyone about the Pelvic alignment either which I found peculiar.  I would think you have to correct the Root Cause of any underlying problem vs. just throwing meds at it (she gave a $3k epidural) or surgery.  Help needed- very confused!  Also, the full prone push up (face down- let hips hang) seems to irritate the nerve as well.  Waking seems to be the only thing that helps.  We want to give it time but we do NOT want to make things worse.  In the meantime going to see a Neurologist at Cornell in NYC just to do some testing.  It's been over a year- trying to get some relief...it is extremely frustrating.  THANKS FOR YOUR HELP.

My boyfriend and I have been together for alittle over 2 and a half years and started having sex about 2 months after being together.  I have been on my birth control ever since then, so about 2 and a half years.  For the past couple of months I never really feel in the mood.  When we first started having sex we'd have it at least 5 times a week.  Now we have it about 3 times a week.  I know that isn't a dramatic decrease, but alot of times when we have sex, I do it just to keep him happy or so that when i wake up the next morning i don't feel guilty about not having it.  Like alot of times, I will almost be relieved when i have a headache or he's really tired because that means we won't have sex.  I don't like having sex if I'm not shaven down there but lately I don't even feel like bothering shaving it because my motivation to have sex is gone.  What could be causing this? I've never had an orgasm either.  Is it the birth control?

20090205074634AA10PNF	Health;Alternative Medicine	What foods or nutritional supplements help improve concentration and/or help increase attention span?	I'm 49 and it's becoming increasingly difficult to concentrate on one task for any significant length of time.  The following background info may be useful:  I've lived with depression since my mid 20s, and I've tried several SSRIs with no improvement, although counseling helped some and I attend support group meetings as needed.  I think that my depression and the inability to concentrate may be related.  I don't plan to take any prescription medications for either at this time, so I'm wondering if anyone can suggest foods and/or supplements that might help.  I've already tried St. John's Wort & SAM-e for depression with very limited improvement, so ideally I'd like to hear about other supplements or foods.  I welcome all suggestions and respect all viewpoints, but please do not suggest prayer.

I'm taking antibiotics (augmentin), and some other homeopathic stuff (for my throat and lymph knots) and since yesterday evening, i got these really bad headaches, which i suppose come from augmentin (it says in the side effect part), but since today, my eyes feel heavy, and the skin all around them is swollen. Could that also be somehow a side effect of the antibiotics? Maybe because of the headaches? Or because im consuming a lot of tee/fluids right now, which i wasn't used to it before in such quantities?   And i don't think it's because of fever, it's almost normal today.

This would happen within seconds of my first drink.  I can only assume this is because it was absorbed in my mouth or nasal passage and traveled.

My primary doctor has finally referred me to a Neurologist. I have been reading and reading about MS and I have many, many symptoms of it and am almost positive that it's what I have. I am just wondering what is going to happen at the Neurologist? What kind of testing is going to be done? And how long does it take to determine if I have it or not? My doctor has insisted for all this time that I have Fibromyalgia but I am missing some key symptoms of that, like absolutely none of the tender points. I have Trigeminal Neuralgia and I just read it usually occurs in people over 50 (I am 36 now, symptoms started for the TN 7-8 years ago, I just found out what it was last year) and if someone as young as I was when it first showed up has TN then there is a really good chance they have MS as well. I have numbness in my feet and hands and arms, I feel like my legs are being electrocuted and stung by bees, I have what feels like RLS from my chin to my toes 24/7, I lose strength and use of my hands and legs all the time. I have vertigo often to the point that I can't walk, I get UTI's all the time and have kidney pain all the time, I lose my words and can't remember what normal everyday things are called.....like yesterday I tried to ask my husband to please hand me the spatula but I could only get out "that flippy thing" because I couldn't remember what it is called. The list of symptoms go on and on. I am so frustrated and just want a diagnosis already. So any insight and information would be greatly appreciated. And any advice as to how to get the Neurologist to act kind of quickly and not make me go another 2 years before we find out what the *%^$ is going on. Thanks and if you read the whole (long) question double thanks and sorry it was so long :)

The dr that i had kept guessing things like measles, mumps, chicken pocks... stuff like that. but they were all wrongly diagnosed. It all started when i was at school one day, and i got small red dots all over my legs, and only my legs. i went to the nurse but i had no fever or anything, so i went thru school. Then when i got off the school bus at the end of the day i collapsed. I couldnt walk any further. My uncle that was living with us at the time had to come and carry me back home. thats when all the dr visits started. Then when he was done with the wrong diagnosis's he sent me to a specialist. The specialist said if i would have gotten there a day later i could have died. My mom does not remember what i had. i was wondering if anyone could tell me what they think it may be, because all of my old files are gone.

20090204221603AACQF1R	Health;Other - Health	A question about dizziness.?	I get really dizzy after I don't eat for a few hours, a normal range of time, like 6-8 hours and I'm feeling dizzy and nauseous, sometimes in only 4 or 5 hours.  The other night I had not eaten in about 12 hours and I could hardly eat once I did get food, I felt dizzy and nauseous, I honestly thought I was about to pass out, I have blacked out slightly, like, seeing stars, from it before.      I've heard people toss around diabetic when I ask them, but I get regular blood tests, so they would have found that by now.  Someone once said hypoglycemic, I'm not quite sure what that is.  I was wondering if anyone had anyone thoughts on the topic.
20090204224321AAFlRMn	Health;Other - Health	Can anyone help me figure out what this is?	Alright, I thought I had your common cold, but this night, earlier, I started getting drowsy, head started hurting, runny nose, and a slight cough. At that point I thought I had a sinus cold. But then I went to bed, and an hour later, I randomly woke up, my head feeling very different, sort of light headed, and it took about 15 seconds to clear up. My cough was then weaker, and I had coughed hard to see if that would work and it cleared it up a little, and my nose is getting stuffed again. This all really doesn't worry me, but waking up with that feeling running through my head gave me a scare. This is the first night that feeling had taken place. Any ideas? Is it just from being drowsy, and having a stuffed up head that caused this light headiness? Please give me an answer.

So yesterday I was out all day wearing wellies and ever since i have taken them off, i can't wear any shoes or my left heel absolutely kills. However when I don't wear shoes, I can poke and prod it all I want and only get slight (if any discomfort). It is not structural because I can run and jump and everything if I don't wear shoes. Or if I tape my shoes on so they don’t touch my heel it doesn't hurt.   it can't reallly be the shoes either because i wear them all the time and never had any discomfort before...i think it was the wellies that caused it.      The pain is odd, it starts out as a dull pain and will transition to a strong burning. It is defiantly not a blister, or athletes foot, or anything on(near) the surface of the skin.

20090205004521AAZJwdL	Health;Mental Health	Diagnose me, please.?	I'm not sure exactly what's wrong with me, but I know it's something to do with depression and anxiety. I was wondering if somebody diagnosed, or somebody who knows somebody diagnosed with similar characteristics, could help me figure something out.      I'm a fifteen year old female. I've been into drugs since early last year, but I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for much longer. I know some people blame it on the drugs, and I think it brings out the paranoia and worthless feelings, but doesn't cause them. I've experienced anxiety since grade school, with paranoia, and not being able to sleep over my friend's houses without having panic attacks. I started becoming depressed around seventh grade. I have very strong mood swings, from being content to depressed. I feel suicidal sometimes, but I would never act upon it, so I don't worry about that too much. I have a very delusional memory, and my dreams get mixed with my reality often. I have a very hard time focusing, and my mind just goes empty a lot. I have a difficult sleeping schedule. I'm either sleeping too much, or not getting enough of it. I'm a pretty little girl, and have always been on the skinner side.       I've thought before I had major depression, or was bi-polar, or schizophrenic, or had insomnia, or had ADD, but I know I'm not that messed up!      I've been wanting to get help from a doctor, but my mom refuses to put me on meds and I think that's my only option. I don't know if anybody could really give me some kind of diagnosis just based on that bit of information, but any tips, advice or ideas would be helpful. Thanks.

A car, a door handle, file cabinet, anything metal. It's not a normal small zap, its enough to send sharp pain up my arm and to my spine, that can still be felt 15 minutes later. It has me constantly thinking before I touch anything. Imagine hesitating before touching anything.
20090205060310AAlvuaz	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Im pretty sure my 2y/o son has mild Cerebral Palsy?	my son is now 2, and he is the brightest boy i know (he goes to a nursery so i know other kids his age) the only problems he has is that he cannot walk un-aided.       ht tip-toe walks particulaly on the left foot, and doesnt balance well (though this has got a little better recently) i noticed the lack of balance and toe walking at 11 months old, so i took him to the gp, who referred him to a specialist      now, im at the point where he has been seen by 4 people, neurologist, orthopaedic surgeon, gp & physiotherepist, he has ungergone x-rays on his spine and legs, which revealed his bones were normal. this leaves me with the only other possibility, which is mild cp.. now he was a little behind hitting milestones, for example he didnt sit unaided until he was 8months old, and didnt crawl until he was 12 months old.      he has had an MRi scan, which (quote) 'MR Brain & MR Spine scans do not show any abnormalities to account for his tip-toe walking on the left side'      now, i have a follow up appointment to see his neurologist on 28th feb, but im going a little crazy not knowing.. so if anyone has a child or was a child with similar difficulties, i would love your take on this situation, i am prepared for a CP diagnosis, butid love to speak to others in the same boat.      thanks for reading this rediculasly long message!

I am 21 and going on holliday tomorrow for a week, and my period just started yesterday, which is a little anoying since it is a beach holliday.    I know you can pospone your period with birthcontrol pills, but I have not been taking them for a year. If I were to take them now in the beginning of my period, even though it is not the proper way of following the cycles, would it stop my period? Like the same day I take it? I would then take them in the correct order of course, it's just a  little emergency situation.  Thanks for any help.      Love, Michala

Hi, since late yesterday morning about 11am, I felt something at the back of my throat near my tonsils and it feels like it is between the tongue and the beginnings of the troat.      It is a weird sensation... You know when you've been eating popcorn and those tan skin things that get stuck in your teeth sometimes...gets stuck on the back of the tongue? Its kinda like that. Thats pretty much how it feels...kinda like a scab but the mouth doesn't scab because its wet right? So what could this be? I don't remember having popcorn at all this week so what could this be?       It isn't painful when I swallow but everytime I do, I can feel it there and its just agitating me because I know its not supposed be there. I tried looking in my mouth with a light in the mirror but I cant see anything and when I put my finger down my throat everything feels normal...      Now I know how a cat with a hair ball feels :(       Can someone help me figure out whats wrong with me?      Thanks a ton!!!!

20090205083727AAbTOPk	Health;Women's Health	No period yet?? I need your help!! Please.?	Okay, so my girlfriend and I were sexually active in January, the last time we had sex was on Jan. 24. She ended her last period on Jan. 1st. It started getting close to time for her period to come, and for some reason we began to get worked up and started the whole stressing out/ worrying thing. We have done this before and her period was a little late, we think because of stress. We were really stressing this time, I don't really know why, we used a condom and had no mishaps (Thank God).      The worrying got to the point where she took a hpt, and it came back negative. She had a few cramps one or two days, and peed a lot. We thought her period was coming around. She had no signs/symptoms of pregnancy, but we were still worried.      We finally decided to tell her mom she hadn't had her period yet. She was really really tore up about it by now. She had a blood serum test done, and it came back negative also this was 5 days after the last time we had sex.      She still hasn’t started her period yet. First of all, she is notorious for getting headaches, I personally think she gets migraines; they usually make her sick sometimes. Well, last night she got a headache around 12ish and said it was making her feel a little sick. Around this area, the stomach virus has been going around, and she had ate some sort of sandwich and like 2 orders of fries from Hardees restaurant. She had also talked about drinking some Kool-aid that was really sweet before that. This hasn’t been an everyday thing, that’s why I’m not really worried about it.      She woke up this morning, and took another hpt. It was negative (Thank God). Today was 12 days after the last (protected) sexual intercourse.      What do you think? Has all of that stress/ worrying caused her period to be delayed? She still hasn't had it yet. I forgot to mention, we hadn't been very sexually active for a while, and just started back in January.      Facts:   *Protected sex, negative hpt, negative Blood Serum test 5 days after last intercourse, and another negative hpt 12 days after last sexual intercourse.

We had protected sex however for a minute or two we thought we would see what it felt like not to use a condom, but like i said it was only for a minute or two. however on the sunday, i started bleeding again.This bleeding lasted for another week until the sunday and monday (1st and the 2nd of february) ir stopped. I have come back on, on the 3rd and today the 5th i have had a huge bleed. I havent been so heavy since i first started my periods two years ago. by the way, i ahve stopped taking my pill on Monday the 2nd of February as this is when im supposed to bleed but it feels like i have been bleeding for 4 weeks non stop.

20090205083315AAVC9lX	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Infectious Diseases	Am I catching my bf's cold?	Ok, here is the scoop, I need help! I can’t get sick, I am getting ready to start a new position with my work. Grrr      So, last Friday I took my fiancé (we live together BTW) to the ER because he was feeling horrible. He is a pretty tough guy, and I have never seen him sick in 3 ? years. He had a bad head ache, body aches, fever, super sore throat, and bad chills. I got him in and he had a fever, they gave him fluids and meds, ran tests and 2 days later they tell us it is strep throat. He is on Penicillin now, and back to work.      Well, Tuesday afternoon I was starting to get a weird tickle in my throat, and I felt like I had lost ALL my energy. I was trying everything to stay awake at work. I got home around 5:30, and laid on the sofa around 6:00, and slept till 6:00 the next morning. I kept feeling the urge to cough my brains out, but I didn’t so I wouldn’t get a sore throat. Well, yesterday it just seemed to go down hill. I got mild body aches, the cough hurts like no other, and my nose is a little runny. When I cough, it feels like I am trying to cough up something, but I can’t.       I am really just looking for some advice on how I can beat this. Does it sound like I am catching what my fiancé has?      So far I am taking lots of vitamins, trying to sleep, sucking on Sucrets, and drinking fluids. Any other advise would be awesome!      Thank you!
