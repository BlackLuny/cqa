Myyearbook social network I know full well who is responsible cos he has hacked my account before to delete incriminating messages he had sent me. Now everytime I go to click the link to read my mail i'm getting diverted to a filthy porn site instead. I'm running McAfee total protection 2009 that picks up nothing even in safe mode. I use SUPERantispy that cleared some junk up. I've even tried that Malwarebytes and nothing seems to be getting rid of it. It only happens when I go onto that one social network. I've tried 3 different browsers IE, Firefox and Google Chrome (Not all at once) and the same has happened on all 3 browsers..Anyone any advice on what I could do please

I am looking for a nvidia type graphics card which has at least 512MB and has Nvidia PureVideo HD technology and if possible Nvidia HybridPower technology! The main thing I want though, is it to have High Definition 1080p display support!! And it needs to be PCI express 2.0 x16 input! Price range is ￡100-￡175, but I will be willing to go over ￡200 if I have to!      I have been looking at the PNY 9800 GTX 512MB PCIe 2.0, but I can't find it anywhere for sale, that I can trust! PCWorld say they have it, but it's actually the GTX+ that they are selling, which I don't think supports 1080p.      If anyone could find that or an equivalent on the Market for around ￡180, preferably lower, then I would be very grateful!!!      Laurie - thanks

20090221011809AANFwKL	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	World's smallest portable computer that's not a laptop, notebook, or PDA. plz read detail!!!!!! Help?	Plz read this detail - very important.   I require a powerful computer designed for the future, with specific features, and more importantly an absence of other very specific features.   What I need EXCLUDED:    Display. Any means of displaying the information stored on the device must be excluded. I have an accessory designed for that purpose, and I want the security that comes with not being able to use it without said accessory.   Optical drive. With the age of Wifi, I can download what I need from the internet, or slave an optical drive from a desktop computer.   Keyboard and cursor pad input. Again for portability and security, to reduce the physical size.         Features I need included:    USB2. I need several, like between 6 and 10 ports. I could use a hub, but prefer not to.   Wifi. The fastest available, with antenna port for increasing range.   Hard disk drive. Large, like 2 or 3 hundred gigs.   Compatible with XP Pro and Vista.      Other specifications are less important, so whatever the manufacturer chooses will be sufficient.   I am willing to yield on some of the minimum requirements, as long as the majority are satisfied.   Can anyone help??

20090221014721AAQN4yU	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Help me HomeWork summary Text ?	The original IBM PC had a minimum of 16K of memory, but this could be upgraded to 512K if necessary, and ran with a processor speed of 4.77MHz. Ten years later, in 1991, IBM were making PCs with 16Mb of memory, expandable to 64Mb, running with a processor speed of 33MHz. The cost of buying the hardware has come down considerably as the machine's have become commodity items. Large companies are considering running major applications on PCs, something which, ten 3 years ago, no one would have believed possible of a PC. In contrast, many computers in people's homes are just used to play computer games.

Hi every one , i want a help ,   i have  wrote a program consists of two parallel arrays " passwords array " & " numbers arrays " do as the following :      1- write code that will log a customer in. For the convenience of their customers       2- the system prompts them to enter their password only.      3-your code will just need to request a password from the user and check it against the passwords in the password array. If a match is not found, the system simply asks for the password again, and continues to do so until a match is found      4-Once a match has been found, a welcome message is displayed, which includes the customer code and should look like this:    Welcome, Customer gw-3. Ready to start shopping?          here my answer :        "Q2 (i)"        var custNumArray = ["gw-1","gw-2","gw-3","gw-4","gw-5"];   var custPassArray = ["bluea","blueb","bluesky","bluec","blue...      var password;   password = window.prompt("Enter Your Password","");      for (var i=0 ; i<custPassArray.length ; i+=1)   {   {   if      (password == custPassArray[i])   {   document.write("Welcome, Customer " + custNumArray[i] +".

Ok so this has happened to me today for the first time ever.   i have an acer travelmate 240 notebook with intel celeron and 512 MB of ram with windows XP home edition SP3.   5 year old laptop.            I forced my laptop to shut down by pressing the on/off button for 6-7y seconds and it turned off.      after 3 hours i turned it back on and it showed the "windows needs to check your hard drive" thing and i let windows check it.      it took a while but after the scan reached 100% and it it showed the information of the scan my computer froze.      so i forced it to shut down again and turned it back on.   windows then asked me if i wanted to boot my computer using normal mode or safe mode etc. i chose normal.   so it showed the windows XP boot screen and after 1 minute it showed nothing but a black screen. no mouse pointer no nothing.      my computer was still on and so i thought i'd leave it on to see if anything happens.   then after 10 mins my mouse pointer shows up and the log on screen appears.      i log on to my account but i only see my wallpaper and my mouse pointer.      no icons and not even the task bar.i press ctrl alt del it showed the task manager along with EXPLORER.exe  in the processes. so i turned my computer off and after an hour turned it on.      again it took 10 mins to show me the log screen but after i loged in my computer is running normal.im totally confused about what happened.      can some one help me and tell me why my computer acted the way it just did and why is it taking so long to show me the log on screen?

Alright. i bought this new HDD (WD) to be my main HDD, it seems during thew start of windows instalation that 1 file on the windows cd is corrupt? ive been using that same cd for many years lol. anyways so i decided ill just make the new HDD a slave and keep my old 40GB IDE as master. I simply plug in my sata drive and boot up and the pc acts as if nothing new has been connected. I do have a jumper here but i have the understanding that the sata drives do not need to be jumpered correct me if im wrong. I have tried re seating all cables but still no go. oh also when i 1st tried just the new HDD in my pc without the old IDE connected my pc told me "bios must not be installed" Any help would be great thank you for your time.

If I hover my mouse over a file, it opens that file without my clicking, then proceeds to do so repeatedly and open tons of windows. My keyboard sometimes stop registering keystrokes too.      I've run spybot and it found and removed win32.bagle.hi, but even this hasn't fixed the problem.      When I run Trend Micro Antivirus the scan window disappears halfway through the scan but the rest of trend micro claims the scan is still running!

20090221042850AABdIng	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Help, my computer won't start up properly?	I use a laptop with Windows Vista Home      yesterday I turned on Red Alert 3 and as soon as the game started my computer froze and I couldn't do anything. I had to hold the power button to reboot, when turning it back on there were 6 screens instead of 1, tiled on my screen. Then it recognized that there was a problem and tried to go into windows Startup Repair because it said that "Your computer was unable to start". After spending short time in the startup repair it didn't know what to do and then it came up with the message "Startup Repair cannot repair this computer automatically"      So I tried to do a system restore but to no avail, anyway after repeating the process twice (because it kept rebooting itself) the screens sorted itself out and worked fine (games too) up until this morning when it randomly crashed halfway through a different game. and it froze. The same problem happened all over again apart from this time it didn't sort itself out on the third try. Not even on the 8th try.      Can anyone give me some advice on what I can do to fix my laptop?      (I have a backed up my files already)

20090221030603AAfr3jR	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	MY OWN COMPUTER REPAIR BUSINESS?	Hello,        I have been a so-called computer geek/ junkie ever since I bought my very first WebTV back in 1999.  I will Never forget it either.But, I better get right to my question:      So anyway, For the past 7 or 8 years I have become somewhat of an expert at computers; be it just surfing the web and downloading or installing hardware such as hard drives, graphics cards, RAM, etc.  I have even saved myself quite a few thousand bucks too, because I now am very capable of fixing my own pc's and installing the hardware and software;  I can do just about any of it, except deep and serious motherboard repair.  Why one time, I had two like laptops.  They were IBM A31 laptops, and one of them, the screen was dead in, and tha other one had a serious and unrepairable motherboard issue.  When I looked online to check about switching the displays out, everything that I found said for that particular model laptop, it was impossible to successfully switch them out, as many people had tried in the past and failed.  Anyway, the bottom line is I decided to try it, and it was a huge success; at success at which I profited from, and made myself $400.00 due to I was trying to repair one of them and refurbish it for sale.  My wife and I completed out task to a success.    Anyway, with my knowledge of troubleshooting and repair and upgrading of computers, I have to say that I am very good at it.  The problem is that I want to kind of get my own pc repair business going, but I have had no schooling in pc repair whatsoever.  However, as I have mentioned, I am an expert at it. I am not patting myself on the back, mind you, but I am merely explaining my experience.  Besides, I don't really have the finances right now to even start a school.  So I am asking what are your thoughts and/ or suggestions about someone like me opening up a pc shop even though I have no license or degrees? I would only stick to and fix what I am knowledged about, so until I learn more, I would stay away from motherboard repair, but would point the people to the right licensed pc repair company for that.   DO you have to have a degree to repair computers for people? I know that I, myself, have even suggested solutions for pc problems to tech support and licensed and authorized pc repair people on fixing their problems when they could not.  Plus, I love helping people, and I also don't believe in ripping people off either.  so, if you people were like me, knowing quite a bit about pc's and repairs of them, but wasn't a licensed repair person, would you still consider putting yourself out there and open up a repair business?  I mean, is there sny speciial paperwork and redtape that I would need to go through in order to start it?  I am really serious with this, and I have been thinking about it for quite some time now, but have been somewhat afraid to take that leap.   Please give me some feedback, advice, suggestions or whatever on this and getting my dream here started.Thanks for listening!! I am waiting patiently on your replies,

So I used to talk to this guy heapss on msn and myspace, and we used to text heaps.      It wasn't really a big deal for me because he was on one side of aus and I was on the other. So when we lost contact, I started to think he was a bit dodgy.      By dodgy I mean he has like 30 friends on myspace, all of which are girls, I messaged all the people in his top friends and they all said they don't know why there in his top friends because they don't know him.      He never answers any texts or phonecalls, even if my phone's on private or I call from different numbers.       This is not me being over obsessive, this is me feeling discusted that I mightve sent riskay pictures and messages to some 40 yr old man pretending to be 18 yrs old.      But then I think he's real, all his pics look legit, they're all of the same people at different places and times and why would a fake person bother to still sign on everyday?      Idk I just need some reassurence.

I have already placed sets of integers in arr and arr1. Now I have a statement that says arr2.merge(arr, arr1). So I just need to make that merge statement.

I realize Windows Vista has a substitute for the printer browser, but what about XP? Is there some kind of third-party software that can search for and find network printers? I know the printers are there and working, and I know that my friend's Mac and my friend's Vista laptop can both find the printer I'm looking for, but my laptop (Windows XP SP3) cannot.

I've already tried all of them but it keeps going back to the same screen. What can I do.

20090203093648AAEeOrU	Computers & Internet;Software	XP Media Center showing black screen during video playback?	I'm having some trouble with an HTPC that is driving me crazy... I was given this machine without any software so I installed Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005, which is supposed to be the default OS for this model.     Everything goes fine and I am able to install every device not initially recognized by Windows. I then install K-Lite codec pack and some other codecs in order to make Windows able to play several video formats, such as Divx, Mpeg, h.264 and so on. And when everything seems to be working and installed, if I open Media Center and try to play any videos, the screen will turn black just after "clicking" on the video thumbnail, while audio plays correctly and while everything indicates that the file is being played.    - Whatever the video I choose and whatever the format / container it is, the result is the same.    - Videos play fine both on Media Player Classic and Windows Media Player 10, but none plays on Media Center.    - Microsoft Windows XP Video Decoder Checkup Utility will say that the Mpeg2 codec I have got is compatible with Media Center, but Mpeg2 won't play on MC.    - DirectX 9 says everything is working fine.    - It doesn't seem to be a problem about codecs, since I tried to install/uninstall several codecs (ffdshow, Cyberlink, CoreCodec...) for several videos (AVI, M2TS, MPEG...) and they will never play correctly on MC.    - I reinstalled the drivers of the graphic card and even downloaded an updated driver and nothing changes.    - I even unmounted the graphic card (an nVidia) and tried another one (an ATI) and the problem still persists: everything plays fine on whatever player, except on Media Center.    - I reinstalled the whole operating system and drivers a couple of times and nothing changes.    - I also tried another monitor without success.    - I went to the graphic card control panel and tried to alter every single setting available and still no success.      I believe that it may be a very "basic" problem (such as some kind of component missing on the operating system or something like that) because the problem persists whatever the graphic card, the monitor and the installed codecs are.    The main problem is that I don't have a copy of the recover CD supplied by the manufacturer, so the version of the O.S. I installed is the one I managed to find, not the one originally installed on this machine.    I would be really glad if you could provide me with some help about this issue. By the way, "normal" Windows XP cannot be upgraded to Media Center Edition by just installing some kind of update, right?     I'm even considering to install Linux on this machine, but that may also make some other problems arise...    specs:  - Motherboard: P4M-915G   - Processor: Pentium IV 3,2 GHz  - Memory: 512 MB   - Chipset: Intel 915g + ICH6  - Graphic card: nVidia GeForce 8400GS PCI-Express  (CRT Monitor connected to the VGA port, not to the DVI port)  - Windows Media Center Edition 2005 + Update Rollup 2    Thanks in advance!

I think it's supposed to return an average between the two numbers, but I'm not entirely sure.   I have been able to make this compile without any errors so far.      Also, I am using GCC with Ubuntu 8.10. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks :)      And yes, I am fully aware that there are no indents. Apparently Yahoo Answers wont let me put indents anywhere I want, but in the code they're there.

My brother said that one can be slower than the other if the rest of the computer doesn't size up.       A) quad-core, 640g hd, 7g ram    b) dual-core, 320g hd, 3g ram      Both are about the same in gh= 2.2      If they are the same gH, then are they the same in performance?       I work with a lot of windows open and programs going at the same time. I have to pop new windows all the time (from one web site to a new web site). I need something that will be very fast and good at handling a lot of stuff happening at once. I want the windows to pop and load as fast as possible.

Occasionally when I hold in the power button the computer will turn on but will die after a couple of seconds. I cleaned out all of the dust from inside to see if that would help, i'm not sure if it did. I got some answers last night and people said it might be the power supply, is this something that can be fixed easily?   I know, why not just buy a new one? i have a nice laptop and I just want to get this computer running so my parents can use it. It really isn't worthwhile for us to go out and buy a new one if this can be fixed.   If you have ANY ideas it would be great      Thanks.

20090219175447AAdb2Br	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Monitors	Is it possible to have a too advanced monitor for a old graphics card?	Here's my problem.  About 2 months ago (christmas) I got a new monitor.  It's a hanspree, and this is the exact model:       http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?...       Now my old monitor is a ViewSonic PT813.  It's VERY old, and if I remember correctly the one I have was made in the early 90's; so yes, very out of date.      Just like my monitor, my graphics card (or display adapter, or video driver, I'm not sure what it's called, if someone could clear that up for me as well that would be great) is very old too - Radeon 9200 SE.      Up until now, the Hanspree has been fine.  A few days ago, the monitor kept randomly going off, as if it was going into sleep mode or standby.  Right before it did a message displayed something like: No input found, or something along the lines of that.  My computer runs fine on the Viewsonic, but no such luck with the Hanspree.      So my question is, could my graphics card (or whatever it's called) be too outdated for it to run on a more advanced monitor (my Hanspree)?

I'd like a pre-planning program where I could kind of make a flowchart of articles and a linking strategy on the computer instead of handwriting everything. I've downloaded some flowchart programs but wasn't real happy with them. They were too technical or not convenient text options. (The only one I had any decent result with was Dia.) I need minimal graphics but I do need some but would like more text and good copy/paste/move/grouping/ stuff in the program.  (I know, in my dreams.)  Anyhow, are there programs out there specifically for creating diagrams or flow charts of linked article content or even (better yet) the same but with regard to different websites?  What should I be looking for or searching for? Thanks for any input. Free would be great....but if you know of pricey ones I can always look for free versions of something similar.
