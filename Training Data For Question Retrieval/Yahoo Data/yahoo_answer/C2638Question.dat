I was trying to replace a turn signal bulb on my 2001 ford taurus and to do this I had to lift the hood and remove a bolt and 2 L shaped retainer pins.    After replacing the bulb i was struggling to get the headlamp assembly back in place... it just didn't want to go back in. After I got the headlamp assembly seated I mistakenly put the 1st retainer pin in backwards, I noticed this and tried pulling it back out but it wouldn't budge. The 2nd retainer pin wouldn't go in at all so I put the bolt back in and said screw it.      Should I worry about the headlamp assembly becoming loose without both retainer pins?

The mechanic showed me that my rim is severely bent and that my Right Lower Control Arm is damaged.  Control Arm -> The end closest to the wheel has a kink, it kind of looks sort of like buckling.      The steering wheel is crooked while I drive straight and the car pulls a bit when I make FULL turns.      The mechanic has quoted me $700+ for parts & labour.      The mechanic quoted 2 hrs of labour at $94/hr, $79 for a 4 wheel alignment and $59.95 for a new rim.      I've found decent prices online for:      $149- Right Lower Control Arm  (mechanic said $320)    $18- Front Stabilizer Link Kit (mechanic said $39)      Are these prices reasonable? ... Could I be sacrificing quality by buying these parts online or is my mechanic likley ripping me off?      If my control arm breaks, will I loose control or cause a serious accident on the road?      I've heard that this is not a diffcult but tedius repair, should I attempt to do this repair myself?   ^Does anyone know how, or where I can find instructions?   ^What tools will I need?

I'm looking for some advice on some marine wood filler; mainly to be used above the waterline on a small wooden dinghy, but I want something which is wood coloured, or can be tinted to make it look wood colour... but I cant seem to find anything...      I know you can get 'International Watertite Epoxy Filler' - but it is light-blue, or International Interfill 100 - but it is white - although I read you can tint it with enamel paints??      I need to fill cuts/chips/screw holes, etc, some about 5mm+ deep. I will be sanding down and re-varnishing the wood anyway (but not painting it). Is it better to fill it with just some epoxy? Or fill it then coat it in something else? + has anyone got any good suggestions of what product to use – 'Wood coloured marine wood filler' doesn’t seem to exist?!

20090226064053AAFxqJl	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Chevrolet	Please help! something not right when looking at my engine?	Well, this morning I couldn't get my car to stop and actually that is a whole other issue.  Anyway, when I popped the hood (keep in mind I know absolutely nothing about engines ) I thought it looked like something was missing.  My car is a 1999 chevy tahoe, and fuel injected, so on the very top of the engine I noticed this round thing sticking up from the center out of the plate that sits on top of the engine, it has a hole in the center, it reminds me of the thing you check the oil with, not the dip stick but the thing that holds the stick and anyway, there was nothing inside or around it (like the dipstick sticking out would look) and it was very greasy looking and stuck up about 2-3 inches.  What is this and I have to admit at first I thought it was where the breather went but if I understand correctly I don't have a breather since it is fuel injected.  I really need to know because I had my oil changed about a 1,000 miles ago and the place (Wal-Mart) I had change it was also suppose to fix a flat, but because I still had warranty on my tires they gave me a new one, well things didn't sound right when I drove it and finally decided that maybe it was because the tire wasn't balanced (which I paid for) and took it in, come to find out the thumping was a pair of needle nose pliers inside the new tire...yeah, explain to me how they balanced it to begin with?  Anyway, lesson learned I'm not going to Wal-Mart to get my tires replaced and I'm wondering if I should even get my oil changed...because of the way this thing looks on my engine, not to mention that when one of the service people were showing me the pliers apparently the guy who had made the initial mistake was very rude to me and informed me that they would need those pliers back for evidence...like I would break down a new tire and throw pliers into it so I could get another new tire...what a Dumb A--.  Anyway, he also put on the second new one and also was the one who changed my oil, so I'm a little concerned that he may have done other things to my car.  When the fixed the plier mistake they paged to tell me my car was ready and when I went to go get it I found it parked at the back of the store at the very end of all the empty parking stalls and as I was walking out with my full shopping cart that same dumb A-- said you have a nice day.  So I also wonder if he didn't do something to get even.  Please help, am I missing something or not?

20090131191009AAE7n1O	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Car Trouble - I drive a 1994 Ford Fairmont.?	My car is behaving weird, It has regular services, I keep the fluids checked and top up when I need to. I use regular unleaded fuel - not premium or that ethanol mix stuff, I also make sure I use the petrol economically, occasionally almost emptying the tank then fill it up so as to refresh the tank so that it doesn't have old fuel mixing with new.  Whats happening is that sometimes it wont start at all, but if I wait a few minutes and try again it will start.  and other times it chugs kinda lurching, the engine revs then doesn't, so it kind of sputters - the "sputtering" mostly happens when I am driving at or under 60kms. This sputtering kind of seems like the car might be running out of petrol but yet the petrol gauge reads as though it has fuel. When it first happened I thought it might be bad or dirty fuel but it doesn't happen all the time, only sometimes.  Ive had my battery checked, and the spark plugs, Dad had a quick look under the engine at the starter motor to make sure the plugs are on properly - and they were  I don't have any money at the moment to be able to get it checked by a mechanic, I was just wondering if anyone out there had any ideas of what it might be, and also if there is anything I can do until I have money.  Someone told me that it might be a fuel filter problem, do you think what I describe could be that or something else?

Now with the car industry the way that it is and gas prices more reasonable right now I would really like to know if this is something a dealership will even allow me to do.  I look at it as if the dealership is leasing me a more expensive car and making more money off of me.  However I am sure it'll be more complicated than just that.  Thanks in advance.

My dream is to become an airline pilot in the future, but I have a bad eyesight and its worst than 20/200. So can I still become an airline pilot or not? I saw the web site of Transport Canada and it says to obtain the Transport Canada Category 1 Medical ( which is required to obtain a commercial pilot licence), I must have an eyesight better than 20/200 WITHOUT glasses.  http://www.tc.gc.ca/civilaviation/RegSer...  (See number 1.35 b)      In summary, can I become an airline pilot or not, is there any exeptions or maybe it is not true? Is there anyone who is an airline pilot in Canada that can help me with this question? Thank You all and I appreciate your help.

20090131193526AAImQ83	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	What are the steps to getting an american drivers lisence?	Im just interested about it.   I live in New Zealand and at the age of 15 we can sit a test and obtain a learners lisence which means you cannot drive unless accompanied by someone with a full drivers lisence.   After having a learners lisence for 6 months we can then do a driving test to obtain a restricted lisence which means we can drive by ourselves but under no circumstance take any passenger in the car that doesnt have a full drivers lisence.   Finaly after another 18 months we can do another driving test to obtain FULL drivers lisence.      If someone could fill me in about obtaining an amercian drivers lisence the way i have just explained the New Zealand one that would be great!   Thanks

The catalytic converter on my 1998 Toyota Camry need to be replaced. It has 106K miles on it.

Can anyone help me over this?..      Thanks a lot guys!
20090131201019AAUSrJS	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Legal help with used car purchase?	I bought a used lincoln navigator from a used car dealer in my town. I put my truck up for collateral. I made one payment and expect my income tax in a few days and will pay the navigator off. That was the deal we made. Well first he told me there was a 3rd row seat folded down under the big fancy speakers that someone installed. Looked like it was there. Well when I moved the speakers a few weeks later there's no seat there. I asked him about it and he said I didn't think there was one there. Go to a junk yard. I'm like that's the reason I bought it to fit 8 people.also one of the seatbelts won't buckle making it un safe for one of my 2 children who sit back there in the car seats. Also the night I got it the dash board lights went out. Then a week later my taillights went out. Then my headlights went out. Then one day it wouldn't start and when I took the key out it then started on its own. Sometime it turns off when I stop. The brake tag is expired and the tint is too dark and lights don't work to get a new one. All the time since day one I keep going to him saying u need to fix this. He says I will then when I go back he's out of town. Its like he's only here 2 days a week. He had is personal mechanic look at it and the man said there was a wire shorting out that couldve caught fire and looked some more and said everything just about has been changed around and is done poorly. He also said that it shouldn't have been sold to me and that I should give it back. So I told the dealer what his mechanic said and he got mad saying his mechanic shouldn't have told me that and should have just checked the headlights and he didn't know anything. So I said well I don't want this car. He said hey y have u kept it for 2 months? I said I have repeatly told u to fix it and I asked him to put me in a different vechile. And I told him he keeps going out of town. So he said go home and come back tomorrow and ill let u borrow a vechile and get yours fixed. I said just let me use my truck and he said I can't I have a lean on it. I originally bought the truck from him 3 years ago with no problems. So I was expecting this. What can I do? I'm not sure what all was hidden in the fine print. But I'm wondering if I can break this deal and get my truck back legally? I only had this navigator for around 60 days. Also was it illegal for him to sell me something with the seatbelt not working and expired breaktag?also without the vehicle being able to get one with the tent so dark? Is that a loophole for me? I have a 100 percent warranty for 6 months but I know since a lot of parts or aftermarket it probally wont cover it all. Also he says someone normal would have went and paid the 60 dollars to have it put on a diagnosis machine. But I'm like hey I'm paying 7200 dollars I shouldn't have to pay 60 dollars for that. Also his mechanic told me today the man chewed him out and said he shouldn't tell customers anything and just tell him and let him tell what he wants. The mechanic said I told him hey that man has babies and his families life is in danger with that car and he has a right to know. What can I do?please any advice? I worked to jobs for 8 yrs 12-15 hour days and finally bought something nice(supposely) and I'm getting raped.

20090131193517AA53UwM	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	2003 Sierra - dies when put into drive?	I have a 2003 GMC Sierra with 55k miles on it.  I have/had an aftermarket cd player and subwoofers installed with an Amp and a cheap *** alarm system.  I started having problems starting the truck about a month ago, I figured my battery was going bad so I replaced the battery about 1 week ago, when I was changing the battery I had a ton of sparks everywhere even though I disconnected the battery and installed the new battery correctly.  I guess I know now that I have a power draw somewhere.  In this past month everytime I try and start the truck it never starts on the first try even though it strains really hard, but the second time i turn it over it fires right up.  Sometimes after the first try my headlights flash a good 4 or 5 times, is this a code?      Today, I started the vehicle again with the same result, I put it into reverse and backed out the driveway like I normally would, but once I put it into drive it completely died.  It rolled out my driveway, and knowing I couldn't drive it like that, I started it back up and had to floor it in order to get enough power to travel 15 feet up my driveway.      A few notes: my stereo system was stolen and they ripped it out of my dash wires and all, whenever I touch these two fat blue wires together a red light on the L side of my dash blinks, I could do morse code with it, would that be enough of a power draw to completely disable my truck in drive on a week old battery?      If you wish to help and would like pictures of the interior of my truck to show you what I am talking about I will glady supply you with some.      Thanks   Siordiak@yahoo.com

20090131193326AAhKmCA	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Which car should I go for?	I'm deciding whether or not to go for a Honda Civic 2002 or a Pontiac Firebird 2001 model. Both are at about the same price (the Honda is $50 more), and around the same mileage (the Honda was 85,342 and the Firebird 97,212).       Everybody raves about the Honda's reliability and slightly better gas mileage, but the Firebird's beauty and potential horsepower is unbeatable for the price.       I checked out user rating comparisons online as well, and both seem to be regarded as generally "good and reliable." I want a reliable car, but at the same time I want something young and trendy for a college student.      Any further suggestions?
