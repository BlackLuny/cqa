That's how colds, oral herpes etc...spread so easily.   Always pour your drinks into cups and then wash the cups.  Also, if you've been sick it's a good idea to dip your toothbrush in some mouthwash for at least a minute or get a new toothbrush!|`|2r4kfcJmaa	I don't think you'll get sick because you can only get a virus once because your body builds immunity against it after you have a virus one time.

mghrPSKYaa	SoGood isn't soya milk, it's an artificial beverage made from many ingredients including soy protein.  It is designed to taste like milk and be a milk substitute but it's not soya milk which is a natural drink made from soya beans and nothing else til you add sweeteners/flavourings.  Soya milk tastes nothing like real milk and is an aquired taste.  I loathed it at first but grew to love it.  Rice milk, I don't particularly like.  I've never tried shop-bought almond milk which might taste different, but I make my own almond milk from raw almonds and I love it.  It's the most neutral tasting of all the nut and seed milks.  I also love sesame milk because I love bitter things.  Out of soya, rice and almond I would recommend almond for those just switching.  The first two take some getting used to.  Incidentally, have you tried SoGood light?  I wasn't bothered about the standard version but used to absolutely love the low-fat one.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	Rice milk tastes really good, it's more mild than soy milk. But it doesn't have as much protein.|`|pAW2c7c9aa	SOY ftw!|`|4pco9j9Faa	Fortified soy milk is better for you than almond milk, since most almond milks isn't high is calcium. But almond milk tastes WAYYY better, in my opinion. My favorite is vanilla :) I'd try and find a fortified almond milk if I were you, since it tastes do much better than soy milk. Or, if you can get enough calcium and other nutrients from your food, I suppose the fortification isn't necessary. It's important to eat a balanced diet when you are vegan.     Rice milk isn't great tasting (a little watery) and isn't great for you, so I'd just skip that one. I don't know-- some people love it. It's just not for me I suppose.    P.S. There are also other types of milk replacements like hazelnut milk. Have you tried that one? It's good!|`|829070aea711a47d99d908ff132df3bbaa	Almond milk is the bomb.  That stuff is great.  Condorelli( an Sicilian producer) also makes a n almond mint milk.  At first I was hesitant to try it.  I mean Almonds with mint?  Fantastic.    http://www.condorelli.it/ing/storia.htm    Usually it's found in specialty stores/gourmet markets.  Are you in Australia?|`|89c7e5af6668337660a2665976affbf3aa	I LOVE soy milk!     I don't know what kind of soy milk brands they have in Austrialia, so I can't suggest one.  I've liked every brand and flavor of soy milk I've tried so far though.    I really like rice milk as well, but it isn't as nutritious so I'd rather just drink soy milk. I've never tried almond milk but as soon as I come across some, I will.     I've always hated regular cow's milk though, so maybe that's why I like these milk alternatives so much...cause they taste nothing like regular milk.|`|MbSSIOpSaa	I like all 3 kinds a lot, but I like unsweetened almond milk the best. I don't need the extra sugar in the sweet kind.    Almond milk is available at health food stores...there are basically no mainstream grocery stores that sell it.|`|yFXst6L5aa	i love silk soy milk!|`|2r4kfcJmaa	I like soy milk, but I also like vanilla almond milk. Almond milk doesn't have as much protein, but it has vitamins that are vital for being healthy. Try vanilla almond milk. Chocolate is okay too. I don't really like rice milk, but you might want to try it if you are looking for variety.

Sometimes you will feel a little warm inside but that has more to do with beer being cold and wine being stronger and warm|`|QXY34a7Laa	I think a wine buzz is far better...but it could just be that you can drink more wine, and faster, so it hits you harder...but it seems to be a 'thicker' buzzier buzz.|`|3ME7sBxjaa	The speed of alcohol absorption is what really creates variations in the buzz.  With wine you drink it slower but it has a higher amount of alcohol in it.  Beer has CO2 which increases the rate of absorption, this is also true for champagne though.    So you do the math and weigh it against how you are drinking the beer or wine.|`|4MxCAm6gaa	wine makes you laugh and cry at the same exact time. stick with beer and you keep your dignity while passed-out,face down in the dirt!

AA11046585	Strawberry Spinach Salad     Original recipe yield: 6 servings     INGREDIENTS  10 ounces fresh spinach - chopped, washed and dried   1/2 teaspoon dried dill weed   1 pint fresh strawberries, sliced   1/3 cup canola oil   1/4 cup red wine vinegar   1/4 cup white sugar   1/4 teaspoon garlic powder   1/4 teaspoon onion powder   1 teaspoon salt   1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper   1/4 teaspoon dry hot mustard   1 pinch ground cayenne pepper   1 tablespoon sesame seeds, toasted     DIRECTIONS  In a large bowl, combine the spinach, dill and strawberries.

Shake well until sugar is dissolved.   Pour dressing over chilled fruit and greens; toss to coat and sprinkle with sesame seeds.|`|uAyYRXnvaa	Spinach goes really well with citrusy flavours.  If I was to make a salad like this I'd use baby spinach leaves, strawberries, walnuts, lightly toasted sesame seeds and make the dressing from olive, macadamia, or grapeseed oil with a squeeze of orange (and maybe some zest thrown in), pinch salt and probably a small dash of apple cider vinegar.  Maybe also a pinch of chopped fresh mint.... or a dab of greek yoghurt in the dressing as well... mmmmm|`|DFXS4SB4aa	http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Spinach-and...    http://www.cooks.com/rec/search/0,1-0,sp...|`|2n4nCec1aa	Sounds like you already have the recipe!  Get a bag of pre-washed baby spinach.  Top it with sliced strawberries, chopped walnuts and sesame seeds. Just try to remember if there was anything else in it like cheese or croutons etc.. Toss it with a balsamic vinaigrette.  I'm sure it'll be delicious.  Every restaurant has it's own recipe.  Call the restaurant where you had it and ask to talk to someone in the kitchen and get the recipe!|`|cGYJq3Udaa	Poppy Seed Dressing on Strawberry Spinach Salad  1/2c white sugar  1/2c lemon juice  2t diced onions  1/2t salt  3/4c canola oil  1T poppyseed    mix sugar, lem juice , onions and salt together.

Strawberry Spinach Salad  1/4 cup vegi oil  1/4 cup distilled white vinegar (balsamic)  3-4 Tbls white sugar   1/4 teaspoon paprika   1/4 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce   1 tablespoon minced onion   2 tablespoons sesame seeds   1 tablespoon poppy seeds    10 ounces fresh baby spinach   1 quart strawberries - cleaned, hulled and sliced   1/4 cup almonds      In a medium bowl, whisk together the sesame seeds, poppy seeds, sugar, olive oil, vinegar, paprika, Worcestershire sauce and onion. Cover, and chill for one hour.     In a large bowl, combine the spinach, strawberries and almonds. Pour half of dressing over salad, and toss. Serve the rest of the dressing with the salad.  Refrigerate 10 to 15 minutes before serving.|`|VOStCrLgaa	I often mix spinach with fruit in salads, it's a really great flavor combination. You can put whatever you want in it! If you are looking for a sweeter dressing, look at vinaigrettes, a brand called Lighthouse sells lots of flavors, including huckleberry and orange citrus.|`|FNjnYvz2aa	What I do when I make the spinach and strawberry salad is this:     First, I make a "bed" of baby spinach leaves on the plate. Then I slice up some nice, fresh, hulled strawberries and put them on top. Then you sprinkle toasted walnuts over it.     For the dressing, I prepare it the following way and do so at least a half hour before I plan on serving the salad.    1/2 vegetable oil  2 tbsp white wine vinegar  2 tsp. granulated sugar  1 1/2 tsp dijon mustard (as an emulsifier)  the juice of one small lemon and a bit of it's zest (just the yellow part) grated finely.   poppy seeds  dash of onion powder  dash of garlic powder  pinch of dried oregano  pinch of dried parsley  sea salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste.     Make sure the spinach is washed but dry so the dressing sticks to it. Put all the dressing ingredients in a carafe or bottle with a cover and give it a few really good shakes to blend all the ingredients then let it sit at room temperature for thirty minutes prior to serving the salad. Make sure to shake well before serving!     Also, instead of the walnuts, try some dry roasted almonds, or cinnamon sugar roasted pecans. It's to die for. And adding some gorgonzola crumbles would be good too.     Also, you could go for a balsamic vinaigrette too if you'd rather something less sweet. Balsamic vinegar complements strawberries quite well!
f5R5BPTDaa	Corn is a grain.  It has 4 calories a gram  Complex carbohydrate.  Corn is very fungal.  It is very hard to digest.  The reason corn is in everything in America is because  it is one of our largest crops.  Many Americans are walking around  with somewhere like 80% of their diets from corn because of corn syrup (sodas) french fries (corn oil) ketchup ( corn syrup) and mexican food (corn chips/corn tortillas etc)  Corn is only fed to animals in Europe.

Ucz4Q6DTaa	ARG! I just typed up the LONGEST answer, but I accidentally clicked back.    I'll try to make it as accurate as it was before.    When you go to a coffee shop or something, they will probably have some sort of fruit or nuts, I know Starbucks carry's that.       For cheese substitutes, My personal favorite is Tofutti brand. They also make faux cream cheese, sour cream, tons of icecream flavors, ice cream pops and sandwiches too. You can find Tofutti at Trader Joes, Mrs. Greens , Whole foods and most health food stores.    I have also seen things like soy whip cream and crazy items like that. They'res a faux version of almost EVERYTHING nowadays. You just have to look around a bit.    If you like yogurt, they're are tons and tons of options for you. Silk makes yogurt, but my personal favorite is Whole Soy &Co. They carry these at most grocery stores..    Don't buy O'Soy by sonyfield. they have milk in it!      For butter, I use Smart Balance. You can get it at almost every grocery store. It is made with flax seed, so its a great source of Omega3!    Snacks that I usually pack are raw nuts, peanut butter sandwich, and Oreos (Yes! They're vegan!)      Here is a list of common snacks and food items that are vegan friendly!    http://www.peta.org/accidentallyVegan/      Remember, have fun! :D|`|XgaBxHkVaa	Vegan.org  It has recipes and such and eating out guides.

They will have excellent substitutes on hand and good advice on vitamins too.|`|FlVLN3Ehaa	Can't really say what to eat when out at coffee shops since I don't know what your locals serve. Ask the waiter/ress if they serve any vegan options. They may have fruit salad or something.    I don't think there are any good brands of cheese substitute! I've never had one anyway!    You can use coconut oil as a substitute for butter.    Fruit, veg, bread and nuts make perfectly good snacks.|`|pZg05uygaa	When you go to a coffee shop, get a bagel. They're almost always vegan. Pizza with vegetables and no cheese isn't usually on the menu, but you can still ask for it and usually they'll make it. Pasta with tomato sauce, bean burritos with no cheese, fries if nothing else.   EarthBalance is a good brand of margarine with no trans fat, but it's expensive and has artificial flavoring. Coconut oil is the best substitute for baking. It's also awesome for frying tofu.  Snacks: hummus and pita bread and carrots, apples with nut butter, granola.  vrg.org has information about nutrition, recipes, and vegan kids/families|`|ENpymyMTaa	Being vegan, BAKING vegan and EATING OUT vegan is a challenge but it is very do able.     for eating out I recommend for food salad....but if you don't particularly enjoy eating salad, try baked potatoes, almost all asian dishes, I actaully don't exactly know how to tell you exactly what to get but I have done it for a number of years and I have never starved I have always managed to find something delicious and vegan = D does take experience though. When getting icecream with friends get sorbet or when ordering desserts get fruit pie.     Often it is preferable to not tell someone that you are a vegan because they will not know what to make you and usually if you get there, there will be vegetables salad, bread usually soup depending on the meal...and you will be just fine = D    Um cheese substitutes..soy kaas is terrific melts and taste like cheese there is a rice cheese that is pretty tasty as well...I make my own so i have never bought it that much. However toffuti make superior dairy subs. in my opinion.    Baking without butter is hard because nothing is really like butter and often when you substitute you get iffy results..my advice? Research vegan baking recipes in general for everything; google "vegan chocolate chip cookie" and I promise you will find a killer recipe. One that was designed specifically without...you will not suffer for want of information the internet is an excellent source for recipes believe me!!    When traveling a good snack to take is granola bars, mini homeade pizza rolls, pretzels, fruit, cookies...just some of the things I always pack..but I don't know if you are looking for any specifics?    by the way Vegetarian Times http://www.vegetariantimes.com/ is an awesome website and I highly recommend the magazine as well plenty of vegan stuff!!!     Go vegan recipe hunting on the internet you'd be amazed how many GREAT recipes you'll find    Happy Eating!!!|`|c4058327d20f41accfd1c3c424c72f6faa	> What can I find to eat when I go to restaurants  Well, you see, restaurant food is mystery food.  Strangely people will order food, and eat it, not knowing what is actually in it.  I've worked in restaurants, and you do not want to eat at 'regular' restaurants.  It's just full of poor quality foods -- hydrogenated, oils with defoaming agents, msg, colouring, -- it's the cheapest stuff money can buy.  Really.  You need to search out the good quality places.  Otherwise, just ask.  Restaurants must provide ingredients upon request.  All chain restaurants or places such as McDonalds, Starbucks, or etc. all have ingredients lists and you can have a look if you ask (it's also on their websites now).  You'll get to know which places are 'safe' and which foods are 'safe' and when to ask questions etc.    > What are some good brands of cheese substitutes?  Sheese is really good.    > What can I use to bake with as a substitute for butter?  Margarine is just oil.  Usually really bad oil.  There are healthy margarines out there at healthfood stores.    > What are good snacks to pack along when traveling?  Anything goes.    > Any good websites I can go to for support?  earthsave.org  earthsave.ca  I like earthsave.

wqeAeSVYaa	Suitability for vegetarians    As of 2007, all Twix bars in Europe are no longer vegetarian.[4] This may or may not be the case outside Europe also. The Vegetarian Society is trying to persuade Mars to change all their products to become vegetarian after the vast majority were reverted back due to public outcry in 2007. The whey in Twix, Celebrations, Bounty (chocolate bar) and Milky Way bar are still made from animal rennet.    In the United States (as of 2008), Twix bars carry the "OU" kosher certification (Union of Orthodox Rabbis). However, animal rennet can still be added providing the "animal is slaughtered, de-veined, salted and processed according to kosher law". [5] Therefore it is unclear as to whether US Twix bars are vegetarian or not.    ALSO,    Modern method of deriving rennet    Deep-frozen stomachs are milled and put into an enzyme-extracting solution. The crude rennet extract is then activated by adding acid; the enzymes in the stomach are produced in an inactive preform and are activated by the stomach acid.     Rennet = cow stomach lining = not vegetarian.

And your taste is constantly changing.  I have a new drink of choice almost every year or so it seems.  At first beer was absolutely revolting.  Now I love it and enjoy tasting the different varieties.  Same with wine and spirits.  I'm constantly changing my taste for different liquors;  I used to love tequila, now I can't even smell it without feeling faint and like I want to vomit.  I used to hate vodka, now its one of my favorites.  Malibu rum was my absolute favorite for years, now its too sweet tasting.  And on and on.  Variety is the spice of life, and once I get tired or sick of one thing, there's always something else to try.  Right now I'm on a wine kick as my drink of choice.  Those sickly sweet malt beverages like Smirnoff Ice, or Mikes Hard everyone seems to like the first time they try them.  I know I did.  Now they make me sick to my stomach to even think about drinking.  They're like popsicle juice.|`|MDq1XVWRaa	At 14 you dont need it. Let the smell of sweet summer rain be your intoxicant.

When you get old enough I recommend that you only drink good beer!  Don't drink that crap Bud, Miller, Corona crap.  Go with beers from Belgium and when you want to move up from that go with dark beer like Guinness!      As for mix drinks, fruity drinks don't really need to be an acquired taste.  They go down smooth since they taste like fruit drinks.  Start with a Sex on the Beach.      Hard alcohol like Jack, will take a very long time to get used to (if you even do get used to it).  If you ever drink Vodka drink the good stuff.  Be selective about your alcohol.  Don't be like those little dip shits drinking anything and everything just to get drunk.     Always drink for the taste.  Not to get drunk.  Enjoy your beverage.  I have always pride myself that I don't drink to get drunk.  I'm in my 30's and can honestly say I have only been drunk a handful of times.

Geez, there are hundreds; thousands if you consider micro-breweries (nearly all of which serve beer in brown glasses).     I don't think you understand the scale of what you're asking. The vast majority of beers are in brown bottles and while most premium beers are ales, the good lagers are almost always bottled in brown. Green and clear bottles are poor choices for beer since they allow too much light in and may skunk them. Especially lighter lagers that are prone to using the green bottle.

7k8iwvvOaa	I have a wonderful recipe for chocolate fondue that will knock your socks off.  The best thing though, this recipe is super easy and can make an unusual and nice presentation.    Instead of the traditional fondue bowl that everyone shares I make individual dessert plates for everyone.  I take the chocolate fondue and put in a tiny bowl and set it on a dessert plate.  I then surround it with my favorite dippers. ( strawberries, pound cake cut into bite size, marshmallows, etc)     When I am ready to serve the dessert I add the chocolate fondue to the bowls and give everything a quick dusting with powdered sugar.  Its easy because the fruit is added to the plates ahead of time.    Heres the recipe I use below.  One variation to it...this can even be made in the microwave.  I have used a large measuring cup and just warmed it in30 sec to 1 minute intervals.  When I am ready to serve, I just hit it for another 30 seconds or so and pour it easily into bowls.

QXY34a7Laa	No technicalities.  21 is 21, midnight says so.  You'll probably get a chuckle from the server and a 'you don't waste any time do you?" comment.  I did.  I went to the gas station down the road at 12:05 am and bought a 6-pack.  She checked the clock, my license, the clock again, and then gave me the grinny comment.

jkeaEpUraa	There is no type of alcohol that can not keep you from getting sick if you drink too much. All alcohol is bad for you, and you get sick and feel so funny because your body is working off the 'bad stuff' you put in there.|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Sick as in puke or sick as in hangover?  If the latter, try to stay away from drinks with a lot of sugar in them.  If the former, you can get sick from any alcohol, it just depends on how much you consume.|`|MDq1XVWRaa	i dont think one exist or i would have a drinking problem however you can take some precautions by eating something greasy to coat the stomach like a big cheeseburger and drinking lots of water during if possible or of course plenty after.  pickle juice the next morning to recharge electrolytes.|`|hHQIUrNjaa	the fact that you get sick means that you are a lightweight. Dont drink anything hard, and just because a drink is really sweet and doesnt taste like alcohol doesnt mean it doesnt have alot.|`|n8NzX47Iaa	stay away from tequila|`|xPXUzZiJaa	stay away from strong drinks or "well known" drinks|`|MOjHSquwaa	Above all else, remember this...

Ingredients  Serves: 4-6    50 Gram Cooking fat (2 oz)  1x 750 Gram Rabbit, jointed (1 1/2 lb), or 6 joints  225 Gram Ham or bacon, thinly sliced (8 oz)  3 Medium Onions, finely sliced  Salt and pepper  600 ml Stock (1 pint)  1 Sprig Thyme  1 Bay leaf  225 Gram Flaky pastry (8 oz)  Flour  Method  Melt the fat in a large saucepan, add the rabbit, bacon and onions and fry for 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper, add the stock and herbs and simmer gently for 1 hour (30 minutes for chicken). Remove from the heat and cool.    Roll out the pastry to 3 mm (1/8 inch) thick and a little larger than the pie dish to be used. Fill the pie dish with the cold rabbit mixture and cover with the pastry, knocking back the edges and pressing down firmly. Make a vent to let the steam escape. Roll out the pastry trimmings and cut out decorative leaves for the top, if liked.    Brush the pastry with beaten egg and bake at 200 C / 400 F / Gas 6 for 25 minutes. Lower the temperature to 180 C / 350 F / Gas 4, cover the pastry with foil and cook for a further 15 minutes.    Use 6 breasts of chicken portions instead of the rabbit and proceed in exactly the same way.|`|O8qdCBzLaa	Fortunately, you don't have to be a good cook to make English cuisine.

This also dates back to the crusades. It is still prepared in many restaurants across the UK. They vary only slightly from place to place, but the main ingredients seem to remain the same:    Whole Apple  Cheese  Good Bread  Pickles  Salad    If you want to see one, go to my site: depotcafeonline.com, follow the link from the lunch menu to international salads. You'll find it there.    Any good elizabethan history site will give you good infomation, and a search on flickr.com for ploughmans lunch will give you many images.    Have fun! Oh and I am English, just so you know that this information is a little more authentic :))
oAQib10naa	That one actually IS my favorite, it's delicious.

LTS3GCpQaa	I did a mini study recently      Tomato's salad meats peanut butter and more --- There has been an increase in food poisoning in the EU in Canada in the US and elsewhere have occurred in the past decade      Is this evidence of the corporate models failure ?     Is this a purposeful attempt on someones part -- the government the shadow government the terrorists etc ?     I can not post this enough -- here are some people FOX news fired who sued -- they were fired for reporting that the milk you drink was unsafe ( attempting to report ) Fox won the court case because they claimed they were an entertainment network not a news network -- and got legal permission to lie to the public -- because it is all entertainment and opinion      Of course they didn't report it that way at all      Here listen to them yourself and please pass it on -- this one tape explains a lot of the food poisoning --- it really is the corporate model aka the ant colony of fascism and ownership of people     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trWcqxrQg...    Please keep this in mind -- the opposite of love is not hate -- it is apathy      And the corporate model loves itself and hates competition and is completely apathetic when it comes to you the people who just give them money|`|XHnpraaxaa	This is no place for crying.

I have a friend who is Vegetarian and is well over 250 lbs because he eats too much and snacks continously.    If a vegetarian eats fresh vegetables and limits intakes of fats and snack foods it can be extremely healthy but it will obviously depend greatly on the person doing the eating.|`|KfMyKUhTaa	We eat to sustain our health, and nothing in extreme is bad for you, even meat has some nutrients.  What we really need though is prbaly 10 X more vegetables than we get. And when you realise this, (or if you ever try it) you will be amazed at how our huge bodies can be sustained by watery fresh vegetables, even live healthily on Lam'bs Quarters. And yes, it can, but we panic and always don't think so.I don't like to use the word "fattening", but with that in mind, most of what we eat is.

Also:    - Sloppy joes  - Chicken enchiladas  - Quiche ( 6 eggs + 1 c mayo + 1 c milk + 2 c cheese + meat/veggie in a 9" pie shell, bake at 325 for 50-60 minutes)  - Chicken and stuffing  - Chicken Cordon Bleu  - Cream cheese chicken (slow cooker meal: chicken covered with cream of ________, cream cheese (cubed), Italian seasoning packet and a little broth)  - Chicken salad (cooked chicken + grapes + cheese + ranch/caesar dressing)    My advice: each weekend cook all the meat and freeze them. When you are ready to use them, you don't have to worry about cooking them.    Also, try some juice with the chicken.     For example, some tasty dishes:    1) Simmer chicken and 1/2 c of apple juice. Adds a bit of sweetness.  2) Cut pieces of chicken in bite size chunks, saute in hot pan for 10 minutes, pour in 1 bottle of BBQ sauce and 10 oz of orange soda. Simmer for 15 minutes and viola! tasty BBQ chicken.    Also: a recipe my aunt gave me that is seriously killer:    8 oz apple jelly  8-10 oz apricot preserves  8 oz catilina dressing  1 packet of french dressing  2 T steak sauce    Stir together and pour over 1-2  of chicken breasts in a grease casserole dish. Bake at 325 for 45 minutes. OH so good!

Both of these are hot, obviously.|`|0Elxt7Yxaa	There are lots of kinds of teas:    http://hubpages.com/hub/The-Tradition-Of...|`|NRpoJiRUaa	Red Tea|`|msNXomjTaa	You are asking a question for which there is a whole world of answers!    I'm not sure it is "really good for you."  It has caffeine, which is a drug that affects your body.  OTOH, it does have anti-oxidant properties, which helps reduce the risks of cancer.  As in most things, moderation is the key.    I like Yorkshire tea.  It comes from the UK, and can be hard to find (at least, in Canada).  It is a light and mild tea, great for those of use who do not add milk to our tea.  Red tea (also called Roiboos) is not actually tea, but a different plant that grows in South Africa.  It tastes a lot like tea though, but does not have any caffeine in it.  Darjeeling is considered one of the finest teas, and a very good one is amazingly expensive.    The best thing is to try different ones, and see what you like.  They biggest thing though, is to make it right!    1. begin with cold water (has more oxygen)  2. water MUST be boiling when it hits the tea - otherwise, it isn't even tea, but tissane.  3.  warm the pot first, then add tea, then the boiling water  4.  tea leaves are better than tea bags.  The amount you use depends on how strong you like it, and whether or not you use milk and/or sugar. They should be fresh - old tea is not nearly as good.  5.  steep the right amount of time for the particular tea, in a china pot is best, although ceramic or glass is okay.  Purists say to rinse pots out, but never wash them with soap and water.  6.  milk in the cup first, then tea.  The difference is slight, but a recent study shows milk first is better  7.  drink, and enjoy!|`|usxeet5vaa	My mother used to drink this tea at Trader Joes called Blackberry Fusion. I, myself tried some, and it was VERY good! you could also try lemon-ginger tea, as those are pretty tasty. Don't just go to a regular grocery store to pick up tea. Go to one that has gourmet foodsfrom around the world like Trader Joes, and go to their tea selection. They have lots of good-tasting teas that are very good for you, too.

I just stick to good old olive oil, grapeseed oil and macadamia nut oil if I'm feeling swanky.  Flaxseed or olive oil for salads.  Canola is often made from GM products so I give it a miss - Du Ponts will tell you any old crap to get you to use products that they sell the seeds and fertilisers for.  Don't know about coconut oil.  It just seems common sense that Mediterranean diet = healthy, Pacific Island diet = high rates of heart disease/cholestorol.|`|ILpp3ncYaa	I believe grapeseed is the healthiest, could be wrong.|`|aDL7xmt6aa	The Fat Man likes the all!

dTEbLgvEaa	Sorry to hear about your loss - you know - the emasculation thing.      I have always planned meals pretty carefully so that there is seldom any waste.  I always had to work hard for my money (food) and didn't want to be wasteful.  I would start by making a weekly menu based on what was on sale at the markets.  If there were leftovers, I would take them to work for lunch the next day or freeze them for later use.  This habit serves me well in the current economy.|`|36a3ynpJaa	Alost none, but then I steer clear of the fresh fruit and veggies and only buy meat the same day I'm going to use it.|`|8Wqbz6FMaa	None.  We eat leftovers and we freeze everything that needs to be frozen and eat them another time.  I make small portions of side dishes and they are consumed at the table to the last bite. My husband and I are not picky eaters, we eat what I cook and I cook what we like to eat.  When I roast a whole turkey, I save the bones, and other unpalatable parts, boil them, strain and save the broth for soup.  When I grill meat, I use leftovers to make fried rice.  This difficult time is not the time to waste anything, wasted food is wasted money.
hKlsJgVSaa	Ziggy's Fried Chicken-Ziggy is an old cook from my town. He is well know thru out the county for his fried chicken. My mother in -law used to make his recipe at her resturant and he told me that I did it just right.    8 cups flour  2 tbsp onion powder  2 tbsp celery salt  2 tbsp poultry seasoning  2 tbsp white pepper  2 tbsp salt    Mix everything well and put in a reealable container. You will obviously not need the whole recipe, and it is great for chicken fried steaks, chicken nuggets, or anything that calls for seasoned flour.    Set up 2 bowls.One with ice water and one with the flour. Get a large sifter handy.    Dip chicken in the water then flour, then water and flour again. Drop in 350 degree oil. If ou have enough oil to submerge the chicken then your set a timer for 15 min exactly. If you only have enough oil to cover it say half way then probably around 5-7 minutes per side.    SIft the flour after every 4-6 pieces of chicken. The removes and clumps in the flour. If left in the main bowl these will stick to pieces and end up becoming hard rocks on your chicken-NO GOOD.    Even as the water becomes thicker with all the left behind flour keep it unless it gets real thick and goopy-ish. Ot add to the crust of the chicken.|`|36a3ynpJaa	At home I soak it in buttermilk overnight then dredge it in corn flakes that have gone through a food processor.

I then dunk each strip in a mixture of beaten egg and milk, then roll in some seasoned flour, then dip back in the egg mixture, then I roll them in a mixture of flour, pancake mix, salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, ground mustard, and parsley flakes and fry in a skillet with about two inches of peanut oil heated up in it.     Yummy! I then garnish it with a quick sauce spooned lightly over them -  made from canned cream of chicken soup heated with a bit of milk and butter, some fresh chives snipped into it for flavor, a dash of salt and pepper, and a bit of dijon mustard!
PDotv2Hsaa	You have to cook fried rice using cold / last night's leftover rice.     If you don't have cold rice, then you can use slightly less water than usual to cook your rice and let it cool down first.    Eggs go very well with fried rice but you could try frying them first - be sure to break them up into pieces while they're being cooked.     The rice should be added last, after the other ingredients (vegetables, meat) have all been cooked already. Before you add your rice, use your fingers to break up any lumps of rice because it'll be difficult to separate the grains once they're already in the pan.|`|zawmsUO1aa	Fried rice is made with cold, cooked rice - if you try to make it with fresh hot rice, all you get is a gloppy mess.    Here's a basic recipe guideline to follow   http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Ham-Fried-R...|`|69bp1IMfaa	You don't cook rice with eggs.|`|IQq0wNqQaa	Eggs can be soggy. Next time, remove the rice before you cook the eggs. Then cook the eggs, the rest of the ingredients you want to add, and then re-add the cooked rice to the pot over high heat.
k9IppJ6Uaa	This is VERY delicious !!    Mushroom Risotto    6 cups chicken broth, divided   3 tablespoons olive oil, divided   1 pound portobello mushrooms, thinly sliced   1 pound white mushrooms, thinly sliced   2 shallots, diced   1 1/2 cups Arborio rice   1/2 cup dry white wine   sea salt to taste   freshly ground black pepper to taste   3 tablespoons finely chopped chives   4 tablespoons butter   1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese     Serves 6.    In a saucepan, warm the broth over low heat.   Warm 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in the mushrooms, and cook until soft, about 3 minutes. Remove mushrooms and their liquid, and set aside.   Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to skillet, and stir in the shallots. Cook 1 minute. Add rice, stirring to coat with oil, about 2 minutes. When the rice has taken on a pale, golden color, pour in wine, stirring constantly until the wine is fully absorbed. Add 1/2 cup broth to the rice, and stir until the broth is absorbed. Continue adding broth 1/2 cup at a time, stirring continuously, until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is al dente, about 15 to 20 minutes.   Remove from heat, and stir in mushrooms with their liquid, butter, chives, and parmesan. Season with salt and pepper to taste.   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^|`|FwJLD1uDaa	add some white wine to the mix - just remember to let it boil out through these stages:    1. it will smell just like wine when you put it in. boil longer.  2. it will smell like vinegar - yuck! boil longer...  3. it will smell sweet, thats when its done :)     the wine adds a subtle sweet flavor, and i have tried it in risotto SOOO yummy!!!!|`|JvHelUz3aa	go to epicurious.com for great recipes  but when you think it's done wait at least a half an hour  keep adding liquid...  if it says 2 quarts of broth add at least double  it takes a long time but its worth it!|`|PqcwwOgKaa	cooking is gay|`|lpQZYEpgaa	Making a good risotto requires consistent stirring and lots of attention. Patience is definitely needed!! These are my two favorite risotto recipes. The first one is awesome with seafood and the next one is super decadent but goes well with almost everything! It also really impresses people so its great for a dinner party    Lemon Risotto    Ingredients:  3 cups chicken stock or reduced-sodium chicken    broth  5 Tbs. unsalted butter   3 Tbs. extra-virgin olive oil  3 Tbs. minced shallots   2 1/4 cups Arborio rice  1/2 cup fresh lemon juice   1/4 cup coarsely grated lemon zest  3/4 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano   cheese, plus shaved cheese for garnish  Salt, to taste      Directions:  In a saucepan over high heat, combine the chicken stock and 3 1/2 cups water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and maintain a simmer.     In another saucepan over medium heat, melt 2 Tbs. of the butter with the olive oil. Add the shallots and saut until translucent, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the rice and stir until it is opaque, about 3 minutes. Add about 3/4 cup of the simmering stock, adjust the heat to maintain a simmer and cook, stirring, until most of the stock is absorbed, about 3 minutes. Continue adding the stock, about 3/4 cup at a time and stirring constantly, until all but about 1/2 cup of the stock has been used, the rice is nearly tender and still slightly firm in the center, and the mixture is creamy, 20 to 25 minutes.     Add the lemon juice to the remaining 1/2 cup stock and add the mixture, little by little, to the rice along with the remaining 3 Tbs. butter, the lemon zest and the grated cheese, always stirring constantly. Taste and adjust the seasonings with salt.   Transfer to a serving bowl, garnish with shavings of cheese and serve immediately. Serves 6.       White Truffle Risotto    Ingredients:  8 cups low-sodium chicken broth  2 Tbs. extra-virgin olive oil  1 yellow onion, finely chopped  1 large garlic clove, minced  2 cups Arborio or Carnaroli rice  1/4 cup dry white wine  1/2 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese,    plus more for serving  3 Tbs. white truffle butter, plus more for serving                    ---to make white truffle butter, take 3 Tbs softened butter   and add 1Tsp of white truffle oil and blend together.   Salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste      Directions:  In a saucepan over medium heat, bring the broth to simmer. Reduce the heat to low and keep the broth warm.     In a risotto pan over medium-high heat, warm the olive oil. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more. Add the rice and stir until the grains are translucent with a white dot in the center, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the wine and stir until absorbed, about 2 minutes.     Begin adding the broth 1 ladleful at a time, stirring frequently after each addition. Wait until the broth is almost completely absorbed before adding more.     When the rice is tender but firm to the bite, after 20 to 25 minutes, stir in the 1/2 cup cheese, then the 3 Tbs. white truffle butter. Season with salt and pepper. Serve the risotto immediately in individual bowls and top each portion with about 1/2 tsp. truffle butter. Pass more cheese at the table. Serves 6.|`|NaW6epGPaa	Baked Chicken and Cheese Risotto    PREP TIME  10 Min    COOK TIME  45 Min    READY IN  1 Hr      INGREDIENTS   1-1/4 (10.75 ounce) cans Campbell's?

I never order the standard pork fried rice, as it is invariably made in bulk, and kept in the steam table.    Fried rice dishes take only minutes to prepare.  The special fried rice will quite often contain the best of any left overs from the previous day, such as left over shrimp, lobster, and scallops, as well as duck, chicken, and trimmed ribs.  It is comparable to the soup du jour you might be served in a fancy French restaurant.

qJGO08e8aa	i used to eat it a lot as a kid growing up in south africa.  my dad salted the fish and hung them to dry.  i would pick away at them as soon as they got good and dry, salty, yum.  to cook with, you soak in water for 12 hrs and change the water a few times.  this gets the salt out and reconstitutes the fish. then the fish gets boiled and served with boiled baby potatoes, avacado, tomato and banana - great breakfast  or the cooked boiled fish is flaked and you make fish cakes with it.  or baked in the oven with onion, tomato, capers and a bit of white wine.|`|TZCVc9vyaa	I have had it but it wasnt asian.

They are also eaten in other parts of the world where drying is used to preserve the catch.  Obviously, when the fish is heavily salted, it will taste salty.  But a lot of small and skinny fishes are dried with little salt, and this is probably what you should try first before venturing to the big boys.  Before you get the nerve to eat this stuff you have to get pass the smell coz they really stink.  Some stink more than others.  My rule of thumb is the lighter the meat, the cleaner it looks, the firmer it is, the less it stinks (not always true though).  My favorite way to cook the fish is just fry them till crispy and eat it with rice with a side of sliced tomatoes or  spicy vinegar and garlic dip.  Or you can cook it on the grill.  It is also used to flavor vegetable stews. This is usually the poor man's dinner.  Some people describe the smell as something that died two weeks ago.  The taste is nothing like a fresh fish, it really is fishy, but the salt cuts some of the nasty bite.  If you are a loner and have no friends you can fry this in your home.  But be prepared for the smell, it stinks to high heavens and it lingers for days.  But as horrible as it sounds, smells and tastes to every Westerner, this food is one of my top 3 favorites, next to crabs and shrimps.|`|a2S2BrwBaa	Well my parents make it and it taste good also you can buy it in European store or Russian.

Or, make taboulleh or cous cous as the filler.  You could also use oyster mushrooms in place of the seafood, and use the rest of your seafood filling ingredients to make it more similar-oyster mushrooms have a bit of a seafood taste and smell, and are delicious as a seafood substitute.

0fuF2sHbaa	1. How long ago did you become a vegan, vegetarian?    I was a vegetarian age 0-9, then a on-off vegetarian from 13-15, and now I'm a vegan forever, since last year.    2. Where there any foods you had difficulty replacing (if not, why not :D)    None, though I miss Maltesers (chocolate covered malt milk ball things)  I thought I'd miss cheese, but I only really used it on pizzas and stuff and I found a lot of soya cheeses which taste, melt and look the same.     3. How did the diet change affect your lifestyle (nothing fancy needed, just any changes you had or felt)    Since I turned vegan I've been a lot more compassionate and accepting, and I feel happier now. I'm proud of myself :) I feel like I can do anything.   My friends are verrryy accepting (my best friend tried to be a vegetarian, but it didn't work out) so it hasn't changed much in that respect.     4. Do you find your diet more or less expensive than before?    Less, but then we're on a budget at the moment too. It depends on what you buy. Since I became vegan I've also started buying Fair Trade and British-only grown fruits, vegetables, chocolate, coffees etc. so naturally the amount I'd spend on food (without a budget) has gone up.    5. Favorite vegan, vegetarian meal.    Jamie Oliver's Jalfrezi curry :) without the chili.  I love pizza (tomato sauce with garlic and herbs, pineapple and Cheezly) and chocolate cake too, but they're unhealthy.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	1. 15 years ago, I was 10  2.

If I wasn't vegetarian for moral reasons, it'd be for the health changes!  4: A lot cheaper when I compare to the shops my mum did when she waws buying meat and dairy stuff. Granted, I'm only shopping for myself, but it could all be a hell of a lot more expensive!  5: Stirfrys!

I also just felt good in general for being one of the people in this world who stands up for something they think is wrong.  4. I find my diet just the same price. Everything evens out in the end.

It was only in 2002 when I finally became a vegetarian for much longer, and it has more or less lasted till now, as I got the moral support I needed to continue by actually befriending other vegetarians.    For the longest time, no change... I was just as unhealthy- if not even more unhealthy, and tired, but then- slowly, in fact, just in the last couple of years, like an old scar healing, I started regaining my health, my stomach shrunk a little, and etc.   How it affects my lifestyle and makes me feel? What I learned, is it is amazing how much food is around that one would probably like besides meat, so going without should not be any issue. Think about it- any dessert, fruit, or drink is probably vegetarian if not vegan, (and you know you like that).   What do I miss though? I miss barbecued Hamburger and Chicken, and especially bacon- no substitute for it Pot roast and cabbage rolls, and sausage pizza, an endless list.  And, yes, I still like it.    But, I think, and also what I learned is- you can always have meat if you ever want to, no need to be zero tolerant. So, If I miss the bacon or the mutton or the pizza- by all means have a little, but I try to eat as many, or more vegetables, along with it, to offset the effects.     It is wise, even if you are not a vegetarian, to at least consider what kind of mess the food you're eating will be, when it starts coming out the other end.  The more roughage you consume, the easier it is for it all to pass.    Vegetarianism isn't about doing completely without meat all the time, it is about gradually replacing meat by enjoying more vegetables- learning to love those mundane vegetables almost as much as you used to like meat. You're on the right track, simply by taking an extra helping of vegetables one meal instead of meat. That's a better start than dour and spartan 'doing without'.    Being a Vegetarian isn't a game- you have nothing to prove to anyone but yourself.... It is about health, and when you regain your health, you got it.|`|dD8003Ogaa	1. A year ago  2. Not really, as I didn't really eat meat before I became a vegetarian, it was more animal products added to dishes, which were easily replaceable.  3. No changes.  4. Less expensive  5.

Whd6tqLzaa	When you grate a lemon skin, you get tiny pieces of the skin, that is called zest.

Voila...you have lemon zest!|`|AA11029380	It's the yellow part of the peel.  You can grate it off or there are other tools to take it off.  Some make cute little curly strips.  Just the yellow....not the white underneath.|`|1uyhFsFsaa	lightly grate the yellow skin on a lemon but don't go into the white bit as that will turn your zest very bitter.   also it's better to use a fine grater|`|AA12029412	It is just some fine gratings from the lemon peel.|`|64a4NB15aa	Hello , all of my predecessors are almost correct . Zesting a lemon is grating the skin.   However the zest is not the skin ,it is the oil contained there within. The oil that is extracted from zesting is the zest . This is where the flavor and that mouth watering scent emanates . It's not the skin itself !
4M9gnZMDaa	A SHOTTTT WOOH|`|a6a555da6f939b85469e3c83f71c0ecaaa	for every ounce of Vodka, 40% is alcohol, 60% is water and othe ingredents.  Regardless of how much you drink, the ratio is still the same.|`|WKKdQq2Aaa	One shot.|`|QfTEYT3zaa	do you mean a measure? a measure of vodka is about a shot. One standard drink of 40% alcohol like vodka is 35mL|`|54q0mJvQaa	1 shot... which is an ounce|`|ewUQuX4Kaa	I assume you asking what a "volume" is becasue the label says 40% alcohol by volume.  The volume is the total liquid amount inside the bottle. Since it is a percentage, that allows you to estimate the alcohol content of any amount you use. Whether it's a STANDARD 1.5 oz shot, or an entire Fifth (750 mL), 40% is still 40%.  That simply means that 40% of the liquid is alcohol; 60% is water with remaining esters and residual molecules from the product from which it was distilled.    Cheers.
fEBOzWeXaa	butter isn't cooked to begin with.

3zDhj57Uaa	Spaghetti is the actual pasta. The sauce can vary from oil based to cream or tomato. The pasta itself is a complex carbohydrate usually made from flour and egg. The cream based sauces are usually fattening but i still think the best is the oil base just keep it nice and simple  some garlic, basil, parmesan, pancetta, fresh asparagus and good quality extra virgin olive oil. enjoy|`|tgEiSxVVaa	I am not quite sure what you mean by this question but will make a shot in the dark.     They contain a fairly large ammount of vitamin C. As you know the vitamin C can help to boost immune system operation.     If you are refferring to if the tomatoes will make you have a red pigment to your complexion the answer is no. Keratin is the lipid that is found in the epidermal layer of your skin that gives it its pigmentation (color). Now if you were to increase the intake of keratin and overpower the cells before it can be synthasized it may affect you then. As far as tomatoes go I really think its highly unlikely.

Best bets:  2005 Bordeaux and the most recent releases of Napa cab and other blockbuster wines.    I would start by reading Wine for Dummies and move onto websites that go more explicitly into vintages and what wines are good investments.  When keeping wine, often vintage is the most important thing to consider, so do some research before you buy.  Taking a class on wine or talking to wine professionals at a wine store will help you as well.  Be prepared to spend a lot of money though.

There are a different rules but this is how I have played, you take ping pong balls and you have to try to throw the ball into one of your opponents cups, the ball must first bounce on the table than into a cup. If you get it in your opponent must drink that cup of beer then it's his turn. This goes on until someone has no more cups left in which case they lose and probably have to either drink a lot of something or do some other foolish punishment.

I used to weigh 230kg, before I made a conscious decision about myself. I am not going to say not to eat meat. I am going to say cut down on the meat, add white meat, like chicken, turkey, pork. Add fish to your diet, I didn't see anywhere in your question where you mention fruit or vegetables. You can go on a simple diet, but everything in moderation.    Julienne some carrots and celery stuff like that for when your feeling hungry a simple yogurt dip mixed with a squeeze of lemon, and a little dash maybe of ketchup or sweet chili, mix well and you have some dipping sauce if the veggies are too bland for you.

hKlsJgVSaa	I would start with baby portabellas, clean all the gills out of the mushroom caps. Add in the cap place a good scoop of the cream cheese.     Sprinkle with buttered bread crumbs and put under the broiler until the crumbs are nice and crunchy and golden brown.    You may want to put the mushrooms inthe oven for a bit before hand, just try one with out precooking it first. You don't want them to cooked, but you also don;t want them to crisp either.|`|cbp7Gukbaa	Oh my goodness thats sounds lovely|`|Yt8mQK5Iaa	Do your cheese first, and then put it on top of the mushrooms, and around the place.  It sounds marvellous by the way.    ? CupCake ?|`|446edbddd6db88aacfc6cef13d8f3aebaa	Yup thats fine just watch the edges bcos they will crisp quickly    heres another recipe    448 g farfalle pasta   30 ml olive oil   3 cloves garlic, minced   225 g chopped portabello mushrooms   1 red bell pepper, diced   1 zucchini, cut into 1/2-inch slices   60 ml red wine vinegar   10 g grated Parmesan cheese       In a large pot with boiling salted water cook farfalle pasta until al dente. Drain.   Meanwhile, in a large non-stick skillet over medium heat cook the garlic, mushrooms, red bell pepper, and zucchini until soft, about 10 minutes. Stir frequently. Stir in red wine vinegar.   Toss cooked pasta with mushroom mixture. Top with grated Parmesan cheese. Serve warm.|`|i5gyPSCSaa	Ingredients:  For the Mushrooms:  4 T extra-virgin olive oil  2 T Balsamic vinegar   salt and freshly ground black pepper  4 medium, portobello mushrooms, 3-4 inches wide, trimmed and wiped clean    For the Grits:  1 quart whole milk  3/4 cup coarse ground yellow grits  1/2 cup diced fresh seedless tomatoes  1/4 pound grated Manchego cheese  salt and freshly ground black pepper     Directions:  Mushrooms: Combine the oil, vinegar, salt and pepper in a bowl. Add the mushrooms and gently toss until they are well coated. Allow to marinate at room temperature 15-20 minutes. Meanwhile, make the grits.    Grits: Bring the milk to a simmer in a saucepan. Slowly but steadily, pour the grits into the milk, whisking all the time. Let cook until it thickens, up to 15 minutes. Remove from heat and add the tomatoes, cheese, salt and the pepper. To serve, spoon some of the grits into individual plates and add a mushroom to each.    At the Cafe Marquesa(Key West, FL), they go one additional step and add ""Tobacco Onions"" which is made with 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1/4 cup paprika, 2 T cumin and 1 tsp. cayenne pepper. These are combined in a plastic bag and thinly sliced onions are added and dredged. The onions in the flour mixture are then fried in vegetable oil at 350 degrees until golden and crispy. The onions make a wonderful garnish and add a delightful crispy texture to the dish. NOTE: Manchego Cheese is available in most food markets in Florida. It is one of Spain's oldest and most famous sheep's milk cheese. It is made on the plain of La Mancha from the milk of Manchego sheep. Manchego cheese comes in large cylinder shapes, and has a short maturation time--about one month. It comes with and without holes and has a yellowish tint. Rich and full flavored, Manchego Cheese is used a lot in South Florida--some people enjoy it as a snack with crackers or dried bread.|`|fZnuyKSZaa	Creamy Portobello Mushroom Caps    Preheat oven to 375. Clean mushrooms removing stems (optional) to allow easier filling. Drizzle each mushroom with olive oil and bake with stem side up for 8-10 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside. Generously spread each mushroom cap with cream cheese covering entire bottom, lightly sprinkle each cream cheese covered mushroom with chive flakes . (If you use real chived fill the chives in the mushroom and top with cheese ).Pepper or chili flakes give a nice kick.  And then lightly sprinkle lemon zest on each mushroom top. Bake for 5-8 min or until cheese is golden brown.      btw 375 is gas mark 5|`|DXtpSeb2aa	Mushroom Stroganoff    1 lb. Oakshire Sliced Portobellos  1/2 lb.

On the grill, slightly oil the shrooms and grill all sides (watch) so they do not burn or you can steam them till soft and finish on grill. Cool and fill with cheese mixture.To the cheese, add a little lemon juice, black pepper and a small amount of  L &p . Cream with mixer till soft and pliable. Use a pastry bag with star tip and pipe into each mushroom. Top with a small tip of chives|`|HHDq9ajTaa	Here is what  I would do:  Breakfast Sausage fried up with onions drain the grease.  Add in Bread Crumbs enough to make it hold together, add in Garlic, Basil, maybe a touch of Oregano. The sausage is already seasoned with spices so you want to go lightly with the addition of spices.   Scrape the gills out of the mushroom caps and discard them. Rinse the caps and dry gently with a paper towel removing all the water from the inside of the caps. Make a ball with the sausage mix and flatten out to fit the mushroom cap and fill them. Grill them cap down not sausage down...(In case the sausage falls out) until you think they are almost done, then top with a pat of Cream Cheese and let that just heat up. Chives are the garnish as you plate them up.   I make Portobello Burgers once in a while. We grill the burgers, and the mushrooms then place them both on a nice grilled big bun, add the goodies, and they are just to die for.....

ylCxHCKkaa	It depends. If you're baking with it, definitely. Just thaw it in the refrigerator before use. But if you're spreading it on something, I wouldn't because just changes the texture. If it's reaching the expiration date, definitely freeze it so you don't waste it.|`|bmP4NdKuaa	No, but look at the freshness date. It lasts 2 months or something.|`|unALdYL1aa	im a cook of 12 years and think i can answer ur q. if u seel it air tight and freez it it will bi ok. for how long im not one hundred perc. sure but it should last ya a while. i think the way u defrost it is the key to qaulity. dont force-thaw it. let it in in ur refridgerator for a day or two. good luck:)|`|829070aea711a47d99d908ff132df3bbaa	It can, but the texture will change.  You only freeze cheese as a last resort.  I guess that's where your at, so freeze it.    When you defrost it, it's good to add a few drops of milk or water and whip it to a creamy consistency.|`|7ulaznL1aa	You're not supposed to... But I do it anyway. I think the individual packs are the best for that. If your cream cheese is in the foil in a box it's not going to turn out so great. Although, I'd say it's a safer try than letting it rot in the fridge! Just buy lots of bagels so you use it up real fast.|`|4wnM8JtXaa	Although it can be put in the freezer to extend the shelf life, you cannot keep it there forever... it might extend the life by a month or two|`|zQbpJmESaa	Can cream cheese be frozen?  Cream cheese may be frozen in its original foil wrapping, however, it becomes somewhat grainy and separates. It is safe to eat, but the flavor may be changed since it is no longer creamy in texture. Thaw in original wrapping in the refrigerator.
ypB3QDWNaa	A question is a question(s).    1) Say 'Grey Goose seabreeze'.  Alternatively, you may say 'I'll have a seabreeze with Grey Goose' or, 'I'll have a seabreeze made with Grey Goose'.    2)  Yes, you must specify "vodka martini'  otherwise you'll get gin rather than vodka.  If you want a gin martini, say NOTHING, unless of course you have a specific gin in mind.  It really helps the bartender if you are specific in your ordering, especially with martinis AND margaritas.  With martinis, bartenders what to know how you want it served ('up' or 'on the rocks', 'dirty' or 'dry', etc.) and what kind of garnish you want ('with a twist' or with olives), and of course, if it's a vodka martini rather than gin.  So a proper order would sound like, "I'd like a vodka martini on the rocks with two olives." With margaritas, bartenders want to know how you want it served ('up', 'on the rocks', or 'frozen) and they want to if you want salt on it or not.  "I'd like a margarita, up, no salt."  WHAT REALLY PISSES BARTENDERS OFF, is when you place your order, then they start to make it for you, or they make it completely and serve it to you, and then you stop them and tell them some random instruction THAT YOU NEGLECTED TO SAY WHEN YOU FIRST PLACED THE ORDER, like, "Oh, I wanted that made with Grey Goose" or "I wanted my martini on the rocks (because 'up' is the default)" or "I didn't want salt on that".  I really surprises me sometimes that more customers aren't actually killed by their bartenders.    3)  There are a gazillion vodka drinks, so good luck here.  What helps in sounding less 'girly' is if you order them by their ingredients.  Using the seabreeze as an example, instead of ordering a 'Grey Goose seabreeze', instead say, "I'd like a Grey Goose and grapefruit with a splash of cran with a wedge of lime."  Some bartenders may then say, "Oh, you mean a seabreeze, but most won't, and you'll sound a lot less like Liberace and more like Paul Newman.    4) If you want nothing but vodka in your drink, say, "I'll have a Grey Goose NEAT."  You can also use the word 'straight' instead of 'neat', but 'neat' is more specific and less confusing.  If you say 'straight-up', you'll get it chilled and then strained into an up/martini glass,|`|IDBasYahaa	1) seabreeze with gray goose  2) vodka martini  3) espresso martini, king gin, long island ice tea (trust me, not a chicks drink), illegal alian  4) grey goose on the rocks    btw, if you like vodka, so a polish one called zubrovka I love it|`|YdjX5fOWaa	You just need to order a drink the way you like it!  It's like ordering food.  So here are the answers:  1.  You can do this either way.  Seabreeze with Grey Goose or a Grey Goose Seabreeze.  Both are acceptable.    2.  I would recommend ordering a martini specific, like "vodka martini" because originally martini's were made with gin and can be made either way.  Nothing's worse than ordering a martini and getting one with gin - ick!    3.  I can't help ya too much here.  Just ask for a cocktail menu and order what sounds tasty.  There's not such thing as a girly drink.  Just order it like a man.    4.  If you want the drink a specific way, like straight up or neat, then order it that way.  I always ask for my martini's on the rocks, because I HATE martini glasses.  You can also order it in a high ball or whatever strikes your fancy.    Don't worry too much about all this stuff.  It's just drinks, you'll figure it out.  Cheers!|`|9cTAi7waaa	1. "I'll have a seabreeze with grey goose"  2. vodka martini (because there is also gin martini)  3. Vodka: madras, white russian, black russian, Long island iced tea (those mess you up and they dont taste of alcohol at all) screwdriver      Martinis: Dirty martini (vodka w. olive juice) expresso martini  4. if you ask for something 'up' that means without ice and they usually serve it in a martini glass unless its a double. Ask for your liqour on the rocks (with ice) to be served in a small glass.|`|2oYo4krQaa	1. You can say it either way, but it always most proper to call your liquor first, then how you want it, so Grey Goose sea-breeze is preferable.    2.  Say vodka martini or grey goose (or whatever brand) martini.    3. Vodka mixes well with tonic water. Actually it mixes with almost anything.    4.Straight up if you want them to shake it with ice, then strain it into a glass, straight if you want it straight from the bottle.  They will probably put it in an on the rocks glass or a double old fashioned, but that depends on the bar.|`|WKKdQq2Aaa	Go up to the bartender and ask for a big ole KNOB.|`|mJaJplXtaa	1. There's nothing wrong with specifying a brand, so just say it. A gin and tonic might be a "Tanqueray and tonic," for example. There's no right or wrong way to do it.    2. A martini is more typically made with gin, so if you want vodka, you should probably specify.    3. This question is a bit confusing because "martini" is both a type of cocktail and a brand of vermouth. There are lots of vodka cocktails, obviously: Screwdriver, Harvey Wallbanger, Bloody Mary... Vermouth would also be used for a Gibson, a Manhattan, a Rob Roy...    4. If you just ask for a "neat" vodka, you generally won't receive a stemmed martini glass, although it likely won't be chilled either. It may depend on the bartender (or your region) though.

GnG5TM1qaa	You must have that "good stuff" ;)|`|vejHKjEDaa	Prescription cough syrup usually has codeine as an ingredient which has a narcotic effect on your system.  Over-the-counter cough syrups, instead of codeine, contain alcohol and some type of antihistamine - both of these will make you drowsy.  Be careful to not duplicate ingredients - read labels.  In cough syrup, two common ingredients are chlorpheniramine maleate and diphenhydramine - both of these are OTC antihistamine tablets (Chlor-Trimeton and Benadryl).|`|bVbFAyzjaa	because it has alcohol in it, and alcohol is a depressant.  depressants calm your mind and body to the point where you feel like you are moving in slow motion and can become very drowsy.|`|f5R5BPTDaa	Because of the effects the antihistamine is having on you.|`|70TThUpEaa	I think it is because the alcohol.|`|ClPMA3wEaa	The alcohol in the cough syrup.

Talk to your mum, let her know your concern & your choices, and if she decides to listen then great, maybe something great will come out of it! And if not, well then, screw it. HER LOSS!

F32uPjAraa	The secret to any good stew is onions.   Cut the steak and kidney into bite size pieces, place into a pot.   Take two apple sized onions slice and add to the pot.  One teaspoon of crushed garlic.  One teaspoon of cracked pepper.   These ingredients will give you a basic stew. Yummy.  You can throw in half a red or green capsicum.  Put the lot in a pot and cover with water. Place on the stove on low, and let simmer for at least two hours.   Add two oxo cubes, and stir them through.   Taste test. Depending on the size of the stew, you may need to add one or two more oxo cubes.   If you don't have capsicum it won't matter.  Cooking slowly will ensure that the meat is tender. If after two hours the meat is still a bit tough, then cook for another hour or so.   To thicken it, for a medium size pot take three tablespoons of corn flour, and add just a little bit of water. Mix it until smooth. add half a glass more water and mix well. Then add to the stew and stir through, let simmer for about five minutes and serve.  The good thing about a stew is that you can cook it hours and hours before you need to eat it, and then when you need it just heat it up.

STEAK & KIDNEY PIE     Serves 2    INGREDIENTS    200g of beef  100g of kidney  ? an onion  1 tablespoon of sunflower oil  1 beef stock cube  150ml of water  ? a tablespoon of flour  Ground pepper to taste  1 teaspoon of parsley  1 egg   450g packet of frozen ready rolled pastry    DEFROSTING    Defrost the frozen pastry according to the instructions on the packet.     METHOD    Chop the beef into 2 cm (1 inch) pieces. Chop the kidney into 2 cm (1 inch) pieces. Peel the onion, cut it in half, chop one half into tiny pieces and save the other half.     Put the oil in a saucepan on a moderate heat. Fry the beef, kidneys and onion for about 5 minutes until the meat is brown with no pink bits. Stir frequently to stop it sticking.     Dissolve the stock cube in the water. Add the flour and stock, and stir. Season with the pepper. Add the parsley.    Bring to the boil, then turn down the heat until it is just boiling (simmering). Put the lid on and cook very gently for 2 hours. Check the liquid level from time to time and top it up if it starts to dry out.    Put into an ovenproof dish.     Break the egg into a bowl and pick out any bits of shell. Mix up the egg.    Unroll the pastry. Moisten the rim of the dish with some of the egg. Cut off a strip of pastry and place it around the moistened rim of the dish. Moisten the top of the strip of pastry with some more of the egg. Cover the dish with the pastry, pressing the edges down firmly. Trim the edges and make a hole in the centre. Brush the pastry with the remainder of the egg, so that it comes out of the oven shiny.     Cook in a preheated oven at 200C, 400F, gas mark 6 for 30 minutes.     ADDITIONS & ALTERATIONS    For a really rich gravy, use 150ml of beer instead of the water and a stock cube. The long, slow cooking in the alcohol will tenderise even the cheapest cuts of meat.     Add some button mushrooms at the same time as the parsley. Use mixed herbs instead of the parsley. For a beef, steak or even a Desperate Dan cow pie, substitute the kidneys for some more beef.|`|QEEweJUaaa	A great rendition of the old-fashioned filling that's normally steamed in a pudding.

Coat the steak and kidney mix with seasoned flour completely.     Gently heat the oil in a large frying pan and cook onions until tender.     Remove from the heat, mix with meat and parsley in oven-proof casserole dish.     Pour passata or pasta sauce on top of meat mix, followed by water, red wine, garlic, and carrot. Do NOT stir at this stage.     Cover with aluminium foil and place lid on top.     Place in pre-heated oven for 2 hours to cook. When time is up, remove from oven and stir well.

Season to taste.|`|bea06f34d0b27c46fd2e0ca8740043bfaa	Firstly, I would ditch the pigs kidney as it has a very overpowering taste, especially if you are making a stew. Personally, I would 'braise' the meat in an oven proof dish. Place meat in dish, cover with water, add oxo cubes (3 or 4) according to taste, dice vegetables and add to meat. I would cook this in the oven for approx. 2hrs (stirring occasionally) on gas mark 5 in the middle. Braised steak is usually more tender this way and thickens the gravy the longer you cook it.|`|dYcemlE2aa	I'm not an offal fan, so I'd tell you to toss the kidney, but I spose it's up to you.  Cut the meat into cubes, season with s & p, toss in flour and loightly brown in a mixture of olive oil and b utter.  Remove from pan, add some more oil and butter and saute up a bunch of sliced onions and shrooms.  When they're soft, add a 2 - 3 cloves of garlic and return the meat.  Pour on enough Guiness top cover add 1 t thyme and a couple of bay leaves, cover the pot and simmer on very low heat for 3 hours or more.  Remove cover and crank up the heat to reduce the gravy.  Adjust seasonings and spoon into whatever baking dish you plan to use and top with puff pastry or other pie crust and bake the puppy off.

Slowly incorporate the flour mixture until thoroughly combined. Stir in the chocolate chips.     Chill the dough, then scoop onto parchment-lined baking sheets, 6 cookies per sheet.

Cool completely and store in an airtight container|`|53giV6PFaa	I have made this many, many times and this is my favorite recipe so far. The original recipe was a high-rated recipe from allrecipes.com, but I changed it a bit after a few tries that made it even better.    BIG FAT CHEWY CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES    2 cups all-purpose flour   1/2 teaspoon baking soda   1/2 teaspoon salt   3/4 cup unsalted butter, melted   3/4 cup packed brown sugar   1/2 cup white sugar   1 tablespoon vanilla extract   1 egg   1 egg yolk   2 cups semisweet chocolate chips -- I also made this with 1 cup M&M's and 1 cup chocolate chips.    Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets or line with parchment paper.     Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt; set aside.     In a medium bowl, cream together the melted butter, brown sugar and white sugar until well blended. Beat in the vanilla, egg, and egg yolk until light and creamy. Mix in the sifted ingredients until just blended. Stir in the chocolate chips by hand using a wooden spoon. Refridgerate cookie dough for about 20-30 minutes first. Drop cookie dough 1/4 cup at a time onto the prepared cookie sheets. Cookies should be about 3 inches apart. (Put dough in fridge between batches.)    Bake for 10-12 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the edges are lightly toasted. Cool on baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely. Don't worry about the middles looking a little gooey - they will cook more while sitting on the baking sheet.     Watch the time carefully - a minute is all it takes to have a crunchy cookie (still good) over a chewy one.|`|c6IrYctfaa	This is my secret recipe so just keep it between you and me. My husband is a chocolate chip cookie fanatic but he only likes them soft and chewy. So after many tries, this seems to be the one that works for me.     3 c. all purpose flour  1 teaspoon baking soda  1 teaspoon salt  1 c. butter (2 sticks) Softened (do not melt because will cause cookies to spread out flat)  3/4 c. granulated sugar  3/4 c. packed brown sugar  1 teaspoon vanilla extract  2 large eggs  1-2 c. chocolate chips or any flavor of chips  3/4 c. chopped walnuts or nuts of your choice (optional)    -preheat oven to 375'F  -In medium sized bowl combine flour, baking soda and salt. Set aside.  -Combine butter, brown sugar and white sugar in large mixer bowl. Beat until creamy. Add vanilla extract and beat about 15 seconds. Add 1 egg and beat about 1 minute. Add second egg and beat about 1 minute.   -Make sure to scrape sides of bowl after each addition.  -Slowly add flour mixture to butter mixture beat just untill combined. Using spoon/spatula stir in morsels and nuts.   -Drop dough by rounded table spoon onto ungreased cookie sheet about 2 inches apart. Bake 9-12 minutes or until golden brown. Allow cookies to cool on cookie sheet about 2 minutes. Remove from cookie sheet to wire cooling rack and allow to cool completely. If you remove cookies to quickly they will fall apart.

HHDq9ajTaa	I have a convection micro as well, but mine came with a metal plate. I would think that the glass plate is tempered so it would be ok. They couldn't sell a non tempered plate to go in the micros or it would break rather quickly under normal use. If you have both a metal and a glass then use the metal when convection cooking.   As suggested by another answerer, you can look up or request an instruction manual from the makers website.|`|VrzX3mWsaa	No you do not. All you need to remember is not using a dish or container which would not work for either.. so metal is out ( due to microwave) and plastic is out ( due to grill)  so.. every glass container like pyrex ware is fine.. normal dishes for pasta like lasagne dishes.    you may find help by these links:    http://microwaves.cookery-guide.info/typ...    http://www.which.co.uk/reviews/microwave...|`|KUYQ9IMHaa	You might look online to find a manual.

cfdc405defe60d37e2129e3f90174096aa	I buy fried tofu puffs here in Toronto Canada, I cut them into soups and stir frys, and also use them in long braised Asian dishes with mushrooms and veg in a sandy pot, in the oven for 1-2 hours and simmer slow so they absorb the flavours, I do this with seitan puffs to.    One thing is there hollow so you can make a slit, and add a veggie stuffing and steam, then top with a spicy sauce or just a soya based one.|`|YYAu9lFDaa	you don't cook FRIED tofu, you cook tofu or your fry tofu.    but anyway, just use oil in a pan and season your tofu and cook/fry it.|`|NNiN0tK0aa	I would fry some onions and garlic.  While they're cooking mash up some tofu with a fork, and chop scallions, tomatoes, peppers, zucchini, mushrooms and herbs.  Add them to the pan, fry em all up.  You could add some tinned tomatoes if its gets too dry.|`|m1cEbzBcaa	slice tofu and drop into hot oil?|`|FlsrXuJOaa	i actually like to bake it. I marinate it in a mix of soy sauce, garlic, maple syrup, ketchup, vinegar, pepper and liquid smoke (it might sound gross, but it is very yummy) and bake it for a half hour or so, turning it every once in a while. it gets really crispy and you can put it in a stir-fry or put it on top of a salad.|`|f0423c049434af188b8aae9a68343013aa	This was my method when I still ate tofu:  1- Buy extra-firm tofu either in the box or in a shallow pan with the brine.  2- Drain the tofu by setting the tofu in the kitchen sink on a plate. Place another plate on top with something heavy (like a can of food) on top of that. As it drains, periodically tip the plate to drain off excess liquid.   3- After tofu has drained, cut or chop into desired shapes (strips, cubes, steaks, etc).   4- Make a marinade that will compliment what you are cooking. Marinate the tofu overnight in the refrigerator. If you are going to eat it sooner, just use the mixture as your dipping liquid.   5- Prepare your skillet. Place a small amount of vegetable oil in a pan and heat on medium-high heat. Allow the skillet to warm to the point where a dusting of light flour excites the oil.  6- Take the marinated tofu pieces and dredge them in whole wheat flour, coating both sides evenly. (If you didn't marinate over night, just use the dipping sauce to dip the tofu and then dredge it in the flour).  7- Gently place the tofu in the hot oil and allow it to fry for 2-3 minutes. The flour will turn a golden brown. Carefully turn the tofu over and brown the other side.   8- Spoon out the tofu and allow it to drain on a paper towel.   9- Add to whatever dish you desire and enjoy.|`|St6kmJ1laa	well uhh.. u cant buy fried tofu already but u can saute like u would do veges...|`|IKzd9UCUaa	Two easy ways:    Cut into rectangles about the size of an eraser  dip in corn starch  heat up some vegetable oil over med heat  fry until crispy, about 1-2 minutes, then flip  drain on paper towel    this makes a tofu good for eating as a side dish, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. Put some kind of sweet sauce on it,   such as  soy sauce and honey and sesame oil (equal parts)      METHOD 2  Cube the tofu and put in a bowl with the following:    3 tblsp soy sauce  1 tsp hot sauce  1 tsp honey  1 clove minced garlic  2 tsp minced ginger root    Let it sit while you chop an onion and saute over medium low heat until translucent, about 10 minutes  Add the tofu and the mixture, keep cooking until the liquid is absorbed and the tofu is cripsy    Great for adding to a stir fry with veggies and rice        you can drain the tofu first by putting it in a strainer with a bowl full of water in top of it but it's not necessary
HHDq9ajTaa	The water keeps the roast from sticking to the bottom of the crockpot, so spray some oil on the bottom and add cut up onions/grated carrots to the bottom first. They will almost disappear in the cooking and add moisture to the pan for juices. Adding in some BBQ sauce at the beginning would also help give you the needed moisture if you omit the water. We like the juicy BBQ sauce in the sandwiches and don't care for DRY sandwiches...it is all up to personal taste.|`|dYcemlE2aa	No|`|EG1WRTT7aa	no, no ,and no you can't add water on the crock when you cook it for Barbeque sandwiches you only do that when you cooking it inside of soup!!|`|5IBwPplHaa	you really don't have to add water because the juice from the meat will help cook it...but if your recipe say so, please follow its procedure.my own experience in crock pot cooking is adding a few drops of liquid or oil because slow cooking at long hours will produce the right amount of sauce coming from the meat itself.|`|KUYQ9IMHaa	I always brown the meat very well on all sides before putting it in the slow cooker, to get that nice caramelization that imparts great flavor.     Then you can add a little liquid. Water or stock work well. A bottle of beer gives it a great flavor. So does a can of Coke.    Add lots of garlic, bay leaves, a little bit of liquid smoke, all will add a nice flavor to the meat before you even add BBQ sauce. I like to add some heat too, in the form of crushed red pepper, cayenne, Tabasco sauce - something like that.    You don't need a lot of liquid, but that really does depend on the cut of meat you're using and the fat content. But I like to use the liquid, because then I use that flavorful liquid the add to the beans I like to have with my BBQ.|`|mJaJplXtaa	Most crockpots need at least a small amount of liquid present to cook properly. The heating elements tend to be focused in specific areas, so the liquid helps distribute the heat around the pot and to the food. Not doing that might result in uneven cooking.|`|q2AsDnjpaa	If you have made it both ways and you like it with out water there is your answer. I think a little water would be good though. It will just evaporate if you open the lid for the last 5-10 min of cooking.|`|nOVSf06Raa	you can add a bit of broth if you like , I was looking at recipes and they all have a bit of liquid of some sort , when I use the slow cooker I always add a bit . But everybody has their own way around the kitchen this is what make cooking so interesting and challenging , trial and error are a must in order to learn .    http://www.cdkitchen.com/recipes/recs/56...|`|DXtpSeb2aa	no|`|53giV6PFaa	This is how I have always made my bbq sandwiches. Put your pork roast in crock pot fatty side up.  Then add dry onion soup mix and 2 cups of water.  Cook all day (8-10 hours) and drain water at the end.  Shred and add your favorite bbq sauce.  You can do this with a beef roast too.  This way your meat gets very moist.      If you don't add water, then use a fattier cut of meat so you can get plenty of liquid to your meat and then spray the bottom of your crock pot dish so it doesn't stick to it if you doing the "dry" method.|`|AA11193401	i would

2FtkHC2vaa	detecting vodka is a little hard to trace since it really has no taste or smell. Vodka is usually odorless and tasteless. There are tons of things people use to mix vodka or rum with such as Pepsi or Coke, Personally, I prefer Pepsi or Coke since Coke has a flat taste. But, like I was saying, people mix all kinds of beverages like OJ or any kind of juice for that matter. Generally, people drink mixers for the taste. What's the big deal about getting drunk?

I think they are all about the same.    Many think purple, because they are always in salads, but they can get very strong after being cut.  For a salad any will do, but a 10 minute soak in cold water will remove that strong taste.    Truly, it all depends on the age of the onion.  Of course, the most highly praised for sweetness and mildness are Vidalia onions.  (white)|`|654c7643984cd6b3f7f0f00356056e81aa	The mildest onion of all is the Vidalia onion, which is sweet.  It originated in Vidalia, Georgia and is carried in most supermarkets, but is not available year-round.    I have found that purple onions tend to be the strongest of the three you mention, but white and yellow tend to be about the same.    When choosing onions, the shape should help you with the flavor...the very round ones will likely be more strong than the ones that are more like a "squashed" ball...    I was given that bit of information by an old farmer at a local produce stand, a gentleman who had been planting onions for about 50 years...his advice has helped me greatly in choosing produce over the years.|`|ylCxHCKkaa	I'm no onion expert, but I think the purple ones are pretty mild.

See link with warning to people who are sensitive to caffeine.  Some coffees (8oz.) aren't as high in caffeine. Note, also, the blue and red dyes.

The sugar content is one ounce which comes to 120 of the 220 calories listed.  Gadzz - for 220 calories, I can have almost 4 ounces of a beef ribeye steak - I'd rather have steak (which costs the same and has no caffeine ...).|`|AA10391286	Caffine overdose is evil!!!  Caffeine overdose can cause nausea, diarrhea, light-headedness and urinary frequency. Why even bother?|`|A1DSqKT4aa	Terrible idea. Caffeine overdose is similar to other stimulant drug overdoses - you get shaky, paranoid, sick... Lots of bad things. Don't do it man. You could end up in the hospital if you're susceptible to caffeine.
1wNsBNmxaa	Nothing in the Quran requires Muslims to be vegetarians. However, there are certain restrictions on what Muslims can eat or drink  these restrictions are called Halal. Halal means permissible in Arabic. So, Muslims cannot eat foods that are not Halal.    Similar to Jewish Kosher laws, Muslims cannot eat any pork or pig meat. The Quran does not state why pig-meat is restricted, but some believe that it is because pigs are considered unclean.    Also, like Kosher, an animal must be slaughtered while it is still alive. This method of slaughtering is called Dhabiha; it ensures that no blood is left in the meat before it is eaten. Because of this some Muslims choose only to eat meat that comes from a Muslim butcher.    Also, under Halal, Muslims cannot consume any alcohol, even if it was used to prepare food.    This is the most common understanding of Halal, and Muslims can eat anything except for these few restricted foods.

What they fail to realize is that the best beer in the World is brewed by Trappist monks, and they seem to have no problem drinking on a Sunday.  If monks can brew it that well, then I'd call that divine inspiration...which is proof enough for me that if there really is a God, he doesn't care about beer on a Sunday.

ed33471891926c944aed65adb8c5db59aa	O xarope da CocaCola n?o tem tanto segredo assim. O problema  que eles tm patentes com registro em ambito mundial e n?o  possvel reproduzir a composi??o da " gua Podre do Imperialismo" [os italianos a chamam de "qua porca d'imperialisme"] sem pagar generosos Royaltys aos detentores da marca, mesmo que voc descubra todos os ingredientes, mas vamos l:  O REFRIGERANTE:  1o] O xarope  fabricado no Brasil pela "Refina??es de milho Brasil", a mesma fbrica da Maizena e do Karo e distribuido para os engarrafadores [Spal em SP, Spaipa no Paran, etc].  2o] A gua varia de acordo com o local em que o xarope  misturado, conforme suas propriedades locais para que o refrigerante mantenha o mesmo padr?o de cor, consistncia, etc que nos outros pontos de produ??o. Igual o McDonald's p?e farinha de minhoca no hamburguer para equilibrar o nvel proteico.  3o] A quantidade de a?ucar varia conforme a temperatura e a press?o atmosfrica [na praia ela  + "aguada"] para que todos os otrios que bebem esta porcaria sintam a mesma sensa??o gustativa.  4o] O CO2 [gas carb?nico] obedece a mesma regra do a?ucar.  O XAROPE:  > Glucose [melado de milho = Karo]  >Ns moscada [pequena quantidade para dar aquele gostinho meio picante]  >Noz de cola [grande quantidade porque contm muita cafeina = estimulante encontrado tambm no caf  t?o viciante quanto a nicotina]  > Alca?us [essa  uma planta tipo cip que n?o faz mal;  at usada como digestivo]  > Antioxidantes qumicos [tem alguns que at conseguem remover ferrugem, mas isso se encontra na maioria das porcarias industrializadas que comemos]  >Conservantes [ a maioria deles causa problemas estomacais e intestinais mas tambm est?o em todas as latarias que comemos e bebemos]  > Sacarose [a?ucar de cana] Esta s  usada conforme o 3o tem acima, mas n?o pense que  usado em pequenas quantidades. Os engarrafadores capricha na dose.  Ta ... desvendado o grande segredo.  Analizando a composi??o acima podemos perceber que para ficarmos acordados n?o precisa misturar Coca Cola com caf porque a droga que estamos ingerindo  a mesma. Basta tomar 2 cocas ou 2 cafs.  NOTA: no sculo retrazado os fabricantes de Coca Cola tambm usavam folhas de coca na composi??o do xarope, mas por volta de 1930 a frmula foi mudada para a noz de cola devido  dificuldade de aquisi??o e transporte das folhas de coca.

"Tout simplement parce que, parmi leurs ingrdients "dynamisants", la taurine et le glucorono-lactone nont pas t autoriss dans lhexagone. Il est vrai que ces deux composs sont prsents en grande quantit dans les boissons nergisantes. Par exemple, une canette de Red Bull ? (250 ml) contient 1 000 mg de taurine, 600 mg de glucorono-lactone et 80 mg de cafine. Or on ne conna?t pas tous les effets  long terme sur lorganisme de la taurine ou du glucoronolactone. LAgence fran?aise de scurit sanitaire des aliments (Afssa) a donc opt pour le principe de prcaution, dautant que certaines tudes peuvent semer le doute sur linnocuit des produits. Dans un avis de 2003, lAfssa dtaille des travaux mens sur des rats nourris avec des Energy Drink contenant de la cafine, de la taurine, et du glucorono-lactone. Il appara?t des diminutions du taux de calcium et de protines, des plaquettes, dans le sang des rongeurs. La thyro?de et les glandes surrnales sont galement affectes. De plus, les animaux tests adoptent de comportements violents (automutilation), prouvent une hypersensibilit au bruit, etc. Bref, de quoi se montrer mfiant envers ces substances !"    A noter que les boissons nergisantes que l'on trouve en France sont des versions "light" de ce que l'on trouve  l'tranger.    "Ainsi, les Energy Drink que lon trouve dans lhexagone contiennent essentiellement de la cafine, des vitamines et bien s?r du sucre."

The colder the bowl, the better consistency of the whipped cream though!     Now, pour in your heavy whipping cream. Add a bit of sugar to taste, add a bit of vanilla (not so much to color the cream though), then fit your electric hand mixer (or stand up if you have one) with the whisk attachment and beat on high until the cream not only thickens but it can hold a nice, stiff peak. Taste bits as you go for sugar content. To go on cocoa you don't want a whipped cream that's too sweet, but you also don't want one that's not sweet at all. :) Especially if you're making hot cocoa from scratch.     Also, try adding a pinch of salt to the cocoa when you're making it. :D Delish!
da580af9e5114d80d24d6e1ac5858417aa	***********UPDATED**********    After reading the next answerer's response, I did some more research as to its legality here in the U.S.  It appears that it is up for debate, but if answerer  2 is able to get it here and intends on buying more in the future, stocking-up is highly recommended ;)    Here is a link to a very informative answer regarding its legality, as well as that poster's links:    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...    "Get ready for a long answer- but it's thorough so at least you will know your stuff and won't have to look too much further.    There aren't many places in the USA that sell Spice unless you go online. There was a one shop here in my hometown that sold Spice but stopped because of the stigma that has blanketed Spice. (Thank you, BBC)    Since marketed, Spice is not for sale in the US. It is likely that the manufacturer sees our government as more of a threat to business (Europe is less risky? Or America will push until its internationally illegal...?) It is sold as incense and labeled "Not for human consumption". It's possible that the US is at least more likely than Europe to catch on to the "Incense" label and realize that it's only use is through consumption. Either way the manufacturer is scared of the US because the US will figure it out and make it an issue internationally and eventually back in Europe. The few places that shipped Spice to the states have since halted.    December 15 ,2008 a lab in Germany discovered synthetic cannabinoids. One of these includes JWH-018, which isn't exactly "illegal" because it hasn't been specifically scheduled, nor does it seem to fall under any category of an "analog". (*As a side note, in an interview I saw online, a DEA agent said that anything that produces effects similar to any other scheduled drug is an analog of the drug it is similar to. This may or may not be true and is definitely imposing on our nations founding rights and liberties. Analogs are drugs- drugs are consumed. Insence not intended for consumption may not constitute an analog.    JWH-018 was found in all new spice products (Arctic Synergy, Tropical Synergy, and Genie) in various amounts. The origional products were said to not contain any JWH-018 but in the same artic, they claim that Spice Gold was found to have a 2% content of JWH-018.    A month later, Spice shipments were stopped in the USA. This is because US customs seized shipments totaling 500lbs of Spice incense at a DHL hub. They were seized because they were said to contain HU-210- a synthetic cannabinoid that is said to be 100-800 times more powerful than THC. Oddly enough, a owner of MJB Botanicals (a vendor of extracts like Baybean- sold as Spice potentiators/enhancers claimed Spice contained HU-210. This was dispelled to be a rumor because HU-210 cannot be smoked! So why Spice's developers would include this is beyond me- HU-210 is     scheduled (Schedule 1- Completely illegal to possess, sell, or cultivate) and- from what I can tell- Spice is trying to be as "downlow" as possible to remain available.    So you asked weather or not Spice was illegal? Well it's up for debate, honestly. It seems nearly everything that is being said and "discovered in labs" isn't clear at all. As you can see- everything seems to contradict itself. I can't even try to decipher it any better than that. It makes me wonder what the Governments involved are trying to do. Are they going to exaggerate about it and make it super illegal,     ignoring any medical benefit? Probably. They did it with a plant so why not that plants imitator?! There is no definition on what is or isn't illegal with Spice as of yet.    So Spice is under the scope. Ordering Spice overseas is risky if not impossible. It is possible to order within the country. However when those supplies are exhausted- Say goodbye to your alternative friend.     Keep informed- I will try to complete this question when I know the real answer (Hopefully I can give you just a yes or no by then...! lol).    As for the second part of your question, most of the other Alternatives, like Spice, were also part of the tests and labs in Germany, and many of these alternatives have been CONFIRMED to have JWH-018. However, US customs has yet to seize those products- they only are aware of Spice/Genie that I know of. Definitely stay away from those. These other alternatives include: Spike 99, Zohai, Smoke, Eclipse, Yukatan Fire, and more that I myself do not know of. (So do your research!)    There's other types of blends that were created to be the American counterpart to Spice. These blends are available in the US and are said to be completely legal. The effectiveness of these blends is up     for debate but, since they're America's take on Spice, they're worth looking into as a replacement for the empty space in your heart where good times and nights on Spice used to be. Visiting herbal-smoke.com will show you two of these worth noting: Fusion and High Octane+.    Lastly, there is a LONG list of completely legal smokables. These blends usually come in massive amounts, compared to the 1-3gs that are more popular. Some come in bags of 25gs, which obviously translates to quantity over quality. I've not heard anything extraordinary about these blends- Some don't even work. The best ones are said to last an hour or two and produce light-to-mild effects. Blends like this include Skunk, King Chronic, Amsterdam Haze, and many others which can also be found there. (This isn't an ad- it's the only place I can direct you that I'm positive will do anything for you and be legal without a doubt at the same time.)    I'm sorry for the massive overload of information but I hope it helps! Be safe out there- don't bend over for the chemi|`|ZVjkgxmdaa	its not illegal, in fact I just bought some today to try. Its very popular around me (Southern California) and you can get it at almost any smoke shop.

d3e35dd9b67f4c61ff3ba906c337697aaa	*banging.head.against.wall*  Crown Royal is NOT bourbon, it's Canadian Blended Whiskey.    Right now I have 13 different bourbons on my shelf, which means that I'm running low and need to go to the liquor store.    If you want to get him a great bourbon, I agree totally with the above people who said Maker's Mark.  Awesome.    If you want a great bourbon that isn't as expensive, go for Evan Williams.    If he really likes bourbon, then there is a good chance that he's already had both of those.  If you want to get him something new and different, see if you can find Buffalo Trace.  I am really impressed with this one and the people who distill it.  Nice bunch.  http://www.greatbourbon.com/buffalotrace...    Cheers, and happy birthday to your friend.|`|AA11825064	Crown Royal is Canadian Whisky, NOT BOUBON!  There are so many "premium" bottles now (see my link), and I've tried just about all of them, and found the differences are really slight, and a matter of personal preference.   Some are more harsh, others more smooth, some a little sweet and vanilla, others more burnt coffee-ish, but you would have a hard time telling them apart blind. Of the higher end bottles, Woodford Reserve is very popular among friends of mine who have tried alot, but most critics actually prefer the inexpensive Evan Williams.|`|279ddedc9e899d854f19c2c13cca7993aa	My boyfriend loves Maker's Mark.

67c2e364f67b92b3f2b531a97c03312caa	If you mean Gefilte fish, try this recipe:    7 to 7 1/2 pounds whole carp - whitefish and pike (filleted and ground)  4 quarts cold water or to just cover  3 teaspoons salt or to taste  3 onions - peeled  4 medium carrots - peeled  2 tablespoons sugar or to taste  1 small parsnip - chopped (optional)  3 to 4 large eggs  Freshly ground pepper to taste 1/2 cup cold water (approximately)  1/3 cup matzah meal (approximately)       Place the reserved bones, skin, and fish heads in a wide, very large saucepan with a cover. Add the water and 2 teaspoons of the salt and bring to a boil. Remove the foam that accumulates.     Slice 1 onion in rounds and add along with 3 of the carrots. Add the sugar and bring to a boil. Cover and simmer for about 20 minutes while the fish mixture is being prepared.     Place the ground fish in a bowl. In a food processor finely chop the remaining onions, the remaining carrot, and the parsnip; or mince them by hand. Add the chopped vegetables to the ground fish.     Add the eggs, one at a time, the remaining teaspoon of salt, pepper, and the cold water, and mix thoroughly. Stir in enough matzah meal to make a light, soft mixture into oval shapes, about 3 inches long. Take the last fish head and stuff the cavity with the ground fish mixture.     Remove from the saucepan the onions, skins, head, and bones and return the stock to a simmer. Gently place the fish patties in the simmering fish stock. Cover loosely and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes. Taste the liquid while the fish is cooking and add seasoning to taste. Shake the pot periodically so the fish patties won't stick. When gefilte fish is cooked, remove from the water and allow to cool for at least 15 minutes.     Using a slotted spoon carefully remove the gefilte fish and arrange on a platter. Strain some of the stock over the fish, saving the rest in a bowl.     Slice the cooked carrots into rounds cut on a diagonal about 1/4 inch thick. Place a carrot round on top of each gefilte fish patty. Put the fish head in the center and decorate the eyes with carrots. Chill until ready to serve. Serve with a sprig of parsley and horseradish.|`|af72e813d9cf1f31d3039c2a0e98a55aaa	eww|`|AA12336927	Baked Gefilte Fish Recipe (Preparation time: 30 minutes; Cooking time: 1 1/4 hours)    1 Spanish onion, peeled and cubed  1/4 cup Passover vegetable oil  2 carrots, peeled and quartered  2 lb. (1 kilogram) ground fish (whitefish, pike and pickerel or your favorite mixture)  3 eggs  3/4 cup cold water  1 teaspoon granulated sugar  2 1/2 teaspoons salt  3 tablespoons matzo meal     Instructions for the Baked Gefilte Fish recipe:    Preheat oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius or Centigrade).   Lightly oil a 9 x 5-inch metal loaf pan (22.86 centimeters x 12.70 centimeters).   Line bottom with a lightly oiled piece of waxed paper.   Fit work bowl of processor with metal blade.   Add onion and chop with a few on/off pulses.   Saut in hot oil.   Cool.   Add carrots and chop until fine.   Return onion to work bowl and mix in remaining ingredients, in 2 batches, using only 2 on/off turns each time.   Transfer to a large bowl and mix well.   Pour into prepared pan.   Bake 1 hour and 15 minutes.   Transfer to a wire rack, cool for 10 minutes.   Place a knife between the fish loaf and pan. Slide it around the edge of the fish to loosen. Invert pan on to plate; remove pan and waxed paper; continue to cool.   Cover and refrigerate or wrap well in foil and then in a plastic bag and freeze.   Makes 10 servings as an appetizer or luncheon dish, 20 as hors d'oeuvres.   Note: This fish is very good served with beet horseradish for lunch. For best flavor when not freezing, make it one or two days ahead.

1a4f835f31e71e049c274298cb8df468aa	You need:  240g plain flour  A good pinch of salt  180 g unsalted butter, diced evenly in 1.5cm pieces  A teaspoon of lemon juice made up to 60 ml with very cold water    Method:  Place the flour, salt and butter in the food processor (not a blender) bowl and pulse a few times to break down the butter to coarse bits. Add the liquid and pulse a few more times taking care not to emulsify them. The dough should look very lumpy.    Turn out onto a bench close to front edge. Use the heel of your hand to smear the dough, in gentle crushing manner, away from you towards the farthest edge of the bench. The result should still look somewhat rough with little bits of butter quite evident.    Knead very lightly into a ball and press into a flat disc about 15cm in diameter then wrap in greaseproof paper and then into a plastic bag. Refrigerate for 15  20 minutes to firm up but dont allow the dough to become hard.    Dust a workbench lightly with flour and dust the rolling pin. Roll out a circle about 3  4 cm bigger than the flan mould. Use the rolling pin to roll up the pastry then lay it over the mould. Ease the pastry into the sides of the mould and trim off the excess. Use your knuckles to gently push up the sides of the pastry to form an evenly edged tart shell. Prick the base all over with fork. Line it with a large sheet of foil and freeze for about an hour or more before baking.     Preheat the oven to 190C. Fill the foil lined tart shell with dried chickpeas or borlotti beans. Bake for 15 minutes then remove the shell to a bench and remove the foil and chickpeas. Return the shell to the oven, reducing the temperature to 160C and continue to bake until the pastry is a deep golden colour and sounds hallow when gently tapped.     The shell is now ready to be filled with a custard mixture containing ingredients such as sauted mushrooms, cooked and squeezed dry spinach enriched with cream and eggs to bind and finished with grated gruyere cheese then baked again until the custard sets.     As a guide allow 900 ml of mixture, such as a third cooked spinach and two thirds boiling cream mixed with 6 whole beaten eggs and salt, pepper and nutmeg to taste.     The trick is to have the liquid at boiling point when it is mixed with the eggs. The best result will be achieved by carefully adding the custard mixture to the hot tart shell while it is still in the oven. Simply slide out the oven rack sufficient to gain access and slowly add the mixture. Slide the rack back carefully to avoid spillage and bake at 160C until set; about 20  30 minutes. The filling will be cooked when a knife pushed into the centre emerges dry. The mixture should not puff up.    Sweet Shortcrust Pastry  Add 30 g pure icing sugar to the dry ingredients. For a richer pastry, combine one egg yolk with the lemon juice and water to make 60 ml. The latter is tricky to roll since it is so short. It helps to roll it between two sheets of greaseproof paper, or similar products that are available.    Follow the same directions for baking the pastry. The cooled cooked shell may be filled a pastry cream lightened with a small amount of whipped cream then topped with fresh berries and dusted with icing sugar.     This recipe is sufficient for a 26-28cm loose based metal flan ring or 6  8 small tartlet shells.|`|b6c9963ffef3d9fa0e84ce0204a598aeaa	Check out www.foodnetwork.com they always have several recipes to choose from.|`|45f48826c86eb5f099c57d00ec3b5bddaa	I could make you one...

So just look on the boxes and multiply the number of boxes to where the liquid required equals 8 cups).  Sounds like fun....make sure it is a flavor they will like eating.....and for nutritional jello....use fruit juice instead of water.|`|0c91efc9959811b1fa902ba0d2606b74aa	well look on the box of jello and it will say how much it makes.  Divide 2 liters by that and you will get how many boxes you will need.|`|f96900d05a7975373330d77b2fad76a8aa	C|`|AA11766653	2 liters! Duh!
AA11755069	Ask ur question in English  Nobody understands this language.  All i could understand is Peru.|`|AA12336927	POLLO A LA BRASA       Rinse chickens well inside out,cut off excess fat, tuck the wings to back of chicken.mix all ingredients and make a soft paste, if necessary add some water. Rub the chickens with mixture inside and out, making sure you covered all parts of the chickens.Let them stand in refrigerator for six hours before you start arraging them in the rotisserie bar of your grill.  Do not use any type of wood smoker when you do Pollo a la Brasa (Rotisserie Chicken)  You can introduce some real wood charcoals to your gas grill so it gives the charcoal flavor but NOT a smoky flavor. Even if your Grill is a Gas grill(charcoals will not last long, and will become ashes). It will take in a semi-open grill about 1 hour to 1 1/4 of an hour at medium heat (180 - 200 degrees F.) on an open Grill will take a little longer and temperature must be between 200 - 240 degrees F. Chicken should be about 12 inches away from fire at least. As you can see there are several variants and all depending of your grill. So,you know your Grill better then I. There arre several recipes for "Pollo a la Brasa" like "Pollerias" outlets are in Lima, this is a very popular one. Try it and let me know. Enjoy!!!
