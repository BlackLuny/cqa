20090131111324AAUMqJl	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Having an opposite sex house guest?	I am an engaged woman, and my fiance and I live together.  I have a friend, who is male, who is trying to get out of a bad relationship and needs somewhere to stay for 2 weeks while he gets his new living arrangements sorted out.  I didn't think this would be a big deal, but when I asked my fiance, I found out it was.  They do know each other, but only through me.  How would you feel if your significant other came to you with the same situation?

20090131111326AATeK2P	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you thrive on love and affection?	'm 23 and I've never really been loved by a man. I was dating someone for a while but he ended up hurting me because he didn't really love me. I think for a while he thought he loved me, but It just wasn't real love for him.   More than anything, I just want to be in a relationship with someone I love, who loves me in return. When I'm hurting, I want someone who will hold me in his arms until all my pain has diminished and who will make me feel like the most beautiful woman in the world. I want to be with a man who will love me with all his heart. I haven't found the kind of love I want and deserve.   Is there anyone that feels the way I do? I'm not asking for a date or anything, I just want to know if my feelings are really normal.

20090131111350AAQedKC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	The guy I am dating says we are moving too fast? Please help I really need advice?	I have known the guy I am dating for about a year. We have been dating for about a month and a week but were not officially boyfriend and girlfriend. We haven't done anything to extreme, Just kiss.        Well, he told me he likes me and I said I like him too. Then I asked him if were ever going to actually be in a relationship.   He told me maybe when we get to know eachother more and that we are taking things too fast.      Should I be worried? Should I just forget about him? Is he just making excuses?

20090131111456AAHI8tM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How Should I Handle This Boy Situation?	I met this boy in August. He's 14 years old, and one grade ahead of me. We used to talk all the time, and we'd hug and text and call each other every day. By the end of September, he started to ignore me, and i started to get really annoyed with him.   In October we went on a field trip where we had to do lots of teamwork and physical work, and he was my partner. Because of that we basically became flirty rivals.   We compete in everything- sports, friends, arguing, and comebacks, you get the idea. But when we're alone, he's so sweet and nice to me, and tries to flirt with me a lot.   For example, at play practice the other day, he was arguing with me (we bicker like a 90 year old married couple), and then a few minutes later we walked up to me, trying to flirt with me (of course i fell for it, as much as he is my rival, i can't help but fall for him.)   I've done everything in my power to stop our rivalry and get our friendship back to the way it was, and i'm trying and trying and its barely working. I'm exhausted, both emotionally and physically and i don't know what else i can do.      my last hope is that maybe time will help fix everything. What should i do??

20090131111934AAk53zd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Told Him I was pregnant & he dumped me.. Now what?	I found out yesterday that I'm pregnant. I told my fiance last night and he went off the deep end. Basically I ended up begging him to believe that I did NOT do this on purpose. I would never do that. I don't' want someone to stay with me just because I'm pregnant. I'm mailing him this letter..    Any suggestions? What would you think if you received this? Men, do you think he'll come around? How would you have reacted?       You shocked me tonight. Because I mentioned a name I liked and because I didn't want you to leave you think I did this on purpose? That is the dumbest reasoning I've ever heard. Just because I like a name, doesn't mean I wanted to have a baby.       Wow how shallow minded you are. First of all, why the hell would I get pregnant on purpose? I have a morality clause in my contract at the university. That means if I'm pregnant and unmarried I WILL lose my job.       How dare you question my integrity and sincerity. I have never lied to you! NEVER! Do you seriously think you're that important that I would get pregnant to try to keep you? Please! I'm a smart girl, I have a great job, and a bright future ahead of me. Why the hell would I ruin my future by getting pregnant by a man who has apparently lied to me constantly since day 1 of our relationship. And obvious I didn't want our relationship to end, so why would I intentionally do something that I know would make you end the relationship? If you seriously think about it, you know deep in your heart I didn't do this intentionally.       I can't believe how cold hearted you were tonight. Instead of comforting me and acknowledging how scared I must be, you put this the blame on me. I took my birth control everyday. I never missed a day. You showed your true colors tonight. A MAN does not act like that. A MAN doesn't run a way from a problem. We should have been figuring out what "We" should do.. Instead you're leaving everything up to me. I'm sorry that this happened, but it's just as much your fault as it is mine. Oh and thank you for making me feel like nothing by sayin "I never loved you." I really appreciate that. It was unneccesary, even if it's true, you only said it to hurt me. You proved to me that everything you have said to me has been a lie.      In the end you're the one who will regret what has happened. I can't have an aborition. It's not the babys fault and I will not end a life because it's an inconveience. I will have a life time of memories and the blessings of this child and you will have nothing. I'm terrified! I'm nervous! I'm scared. But I would rather feel all those things and do this alone than have someone like the man I saw last night in my life.
20090131111627AA7JkNJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Did She Ever Like Me?	Did She Ever Like Me?   Should I Tell Her I Like Her Or Ask Her Out      She like always say hi when she sees me .(SHE GAVE ME A NICKNAME ITS NOTHING BAD JUST MY NAME SHORTENED AND ALWAYS CALLS ME BY IT)..    In Class last year if the teacher calls my name she would turn around look at me and smile and even now she still doesSometimes she would tell me she loves me but i wasnt sure if shes serious because her friends say it to. We talk mostly on msn and barely at school, but her and her friends always get excited when i show up. We are both 17,& a few months ago without telling me one of my friends ask one of her friends who she likes and her friend said sum guy from another school, then he asked another friend and the friend said she likes no one and is waiting for that special guy, which now makes no sense to me and im confused.       (Earlier this year she told me to write I luv her in my msn nick cause it would be funny:S then the she did the same for hers. ppl started asking us if were dating then she said she when I asked her why she removed her nick she said because she was tired of people asking if we were dating:S, On facebook she left a message on facebook and had bro in it.      We started talking less after prom & for A week in the summer she had a Bf but I didnt really think she liked him that much because her msn name was the same while his was he loved her and less than a week after she broke up with him.This summer we didn't really talk until she left me a message on facebook telling"Wats Up Long Lost Home Dog I miss U with Smily Faces ,      Recently She started saying Hi to me less but in gym I see her looking at me alot, .and recently when she says hi she makes her best friend say it to, also if she sees me talking with sum1 she will wait till Im done and she will say she woulda said hi earlier but didnt want to interpt me,& when I walk bye her class she will call me and wave with her cute smile:).       *I was at my bustop 2day and when she saw me she yelled my name so then I went to go talk 2 her , she then asked me if I get annoyed that she says Hi everytime she sees me and I said no its np. And when I got on the bus her & her best friend saved me a seat.
20090131111858AAIzkqb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i just quit chasing him?	me and this guy have been going out for more than 4 months, on and off. we had to break up because he had to leave for boarding school. somehow he was mad at me and he said goodbye to everyone else but me. he'll be coming back soon and i still want to be with him but i don't know if he still feels the same. should i go after what i want or should i just quit?
20090131111857AAmiQ7o	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I have strong feelings for younger woman, what should I do?	I am a man of 47, I am have not handsome and have never been attractive to women. I have had relationships with women in the past but they always ended because of my low self esteem and paranoia. To avoid future hurt I avoided women and I have been on my own now for 10 years and though I have been desperately empty and lonely I have at least been spared the pain of rejection and abandonment. I had built up a rather tough shell and had a reputation as a grumpy old b*stard.   Something recently though has happened to change all that. Through some friends last year I met a young woman who is 31. She is bright, funny, kind and beautiful and from the start any attempts I made to try and evade her or scare her off were rebuffed, as she melted my cold outer persona with her warmth. She is so sweet and loving towards me that I feel things again that I haven't since I was a very young man, like I've been brought back to life. We have developed a close friendship and I know she cares for me but I feel that I am decieving her for while she thinks we are friends I have fallen deeply in love with her. I hide it well I think but now feel I am torturing myself everytime I see her or even think of her with something I want so desperately but will never have, torture and bliss indeed.   I just don't know what to do, tell her how I feel or try to stop my feelings, is that even possible? Could a beautiful young woman ever consider loving a man like me?    My main concern is not to lose her as I'd rather have her in my life as a friend than not at all.   Please help me everything I thought I was is falling away and I don't even know who I am anymore, maybe just an old fool.

20090131111701AAyd4Ce	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why doesn't my guy friend call/text me anymore? :(?	I recently reconnected with a friend from Jr. High and he'd call me pretty often and always respond to my texts (even if it was 15 minutes later, he'd still respond at some point). I really enjoyed talking to him, and he would NOT shut up whenever we were on the phone. At one point I said, "You talk a lot!" Then, all of a sudden, he stops. He doesn't respond to my texts asking him to call me, he never calls me (at the same time, I don't call him, just texts), etc. I once sent a text that said something along the lines of "Why aren't you responding to my texts anymore?" and he responded about 3 hours later saying that he had been really sick and we had a text convo. for about 30 minutes, and that was about 3 days ago and he hasn't gotten into contact with me since??      We are strictly friends, were goofy friends in Jr. High and he has a girlfriend (that he must not care too much about if he's saying things to me like "hey sexy" and asking if I'm turned on by the fact that his hat smelled like transmition fluid--yes, he's a player!).      I know he's not mad at me, but what's up? :(

20090131112638AAjhO3T	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What to do with a shy girl?	I’m a college student, and through a mutual friend I’ve met an incredibly attractive girl. We were only in contact for a less than a minute (a “nice to meet you thing), so I don’t think that it’s been long enough to screw things up, especially since I believe school to be a very different social environment than a bar or club. But maybe I’m wrong.       Anyways, What I know: she’s very shy. Also, she’s (according to her friend) “afraid of the opposite sex”. I don’t know exactly what this means, but I’m guessing that means that she is leery of relationships in general, not males, since she doesn’t seem particularly frightened of the guys in the group. This shyness and likely reluctance to date makes me wonder how to approach the situation.      Any advice would be greatly appreciated.
20090131112643AARXJgR	Family & Relationships;Friends	Major Help With an Epal??????????????	Okay so I have this epal who I talk to sometimes and she was on today and kept saying that she hated her life and wanted to kill herself and I tried to talk her out of it since she is only 11 years old and I talked to her about her insecuirites and told her to pray to God. Then someone instant messaged me from her username and said she was her aunt, and this was the aunt I am almost positive that is was her aunt because she called me names (like sweetie) that my epal would never call me. The aunt told me that the epal wanted me to know that the epal fell off of the bed and broke her arm. At first I thought that it was the epal let's call her....Bob. I thought that Bob was posing as her aunt but then I realized that it wasn't Bob. I copyed and pasted the messages that me and Bob had talked about earlier on and she said thank you so much. I told the aunt that maybe the fall hadn't been an accident. Then, she said thank you for telling me this, I had no idea that this was going on. She said that I was a very very nice and kind person to try to help Bob like this and steer her away from this huge mistake. She said that Bob started crying one day because she told her aunt that I wouldn't be her bffl. I exlplained to the aunt that I already have a bffl that I will never ever get rid of and I only want one.; Anyways I do not know Bob all that well and I actually do not want to be best friends with her. We're hardly normal friends. I know that she is not trying to hurt herself because of me because we hardly even know each other and hardly talk. Mostly she doesn't like school, and her body. Any help? Was it really her aunt? I'm so confused?

20090131112705AAenVOa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ladies, have you ever had to?	Have you ever slapped a guys face good by using a move on him where you stand with with your weight on 1 side and put your hand on top of your hip and stand there for a second, then whip your opposite hand out and slap his face? I need to know if you've used this messed up move on a guy before, and also tell me if any guy has been successful at being able to block that move? Seriously. I had a girl who used that move on me, and when she put her left hand on her hip, i had no damn idea what she was gonna do, but i was watching her left hand anyway, then she *slapped* my face HARD with her right. I don't know how the hell to block that. Worse, i've also seen a girl use it on a guy, and he couldn't block that move from her either, she got him too. I know better than to hit girls back, but i thought(used to)that it would be really easy, just reach out and block a girls hand when she goes to slap. hahahaha! i can't, that crap doesn't work, not on THAT move! What does? Have you ever had to use that on a guy? Was HE able to block it? I dunno if we even can.

20090131113917AAA51y6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does excessive dating means a man is ladies man?	which men is likely to settle down with a long term partner:   - One who dates atleast 1 new girl every year despite being 36 years old. Can he just one day find his perfect girl and settle down?      - a decent man, who has everything right, but, doesn't actively look for girls.  I think he is a better catch, even if a girl has to ask him out first and do some work in a relationship.      this is my thinking process. I really get put off by a colleague who has many 3 monthly relationships ( i am very attracted to him though), and I don't want to date him to avoid being his next catch only.      do you agree to my thinking process?
20090131113338AAzQNZT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Was I wrong in saying no?	There was this guy I REALLY liked. And he started to show interest in me too. He asked me to hang out, and I said yes. Well..we ended up making out (this was my first kiss and he knew that.) Well, the second time we hung out, we made out again, but he wanted to go to 3rd base...and I've never done that before, and I just wasn't ready for it yet. It went , "please" "no" "please" "No." for literally like 3 minutes straight. Eventually he was like ok.   But now he doesn't talk to me, look at me, or even acknowledge my existence and it's so awkward at school sometimes.   We're both seniors, and he's obviously got experience whereas I don't.   Was I being 'prude' by saying no to the hj he wanted?

I am really heart broken and just need answers.

I can say that I never was a controlling girl friend. Yet this past saturday he told me that he just didn't have the same feelings, that he just wasn't feeling it anymore. What can I do? hes a good person, am just really sad like I've never been because, I don't know what I did...just a week ago he was telling me he wanted to marry me. What could had happened?....he actually just txt me he always called me big head lol) he just wrote me "hey big head".......why?......I love him and I don't want to loose him, I don't want this too turn into a friendship

( In the past, we were always tied up with  other people and couldn't make anything official). He knows how I feel. I don't want to be anybody's humping bag so I'm thinking about just vanishing. Not answering calls or texts, blocking him on my myspace page, telling people I don't know him..is that wrong??

20090131120457AA0kdKJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ok, so should I do this?	So I cheated on my girlfriend (I know, I know, I'm a ******, jerk, etc.). Anyway, I told her how sorry I was and we talked about it. So now she's considering getting back with me.   However, she said that there was ONE "little" thing that she wanted of me. According to her, she felt humiliated for being cheated on and now in order for me to make it up to her she told me that she wants me to go with her somewhere public (she suggested the mall) and get on my knees and beg for her forgiveness. Now I thought that wouldn't be too bad, but here's the "kicker." She wants me to grovel at her feet, then take off her shoes and kiss her feet in front of everyone, telling her that I don't deserve her but I'm willing to do anything necessary to get her back.    Now, I understand I'm in the wrong with the whole cheating thing, but do you girls think I should consider doing this for her? would you make your bf do this?       I mean, to get on my knees in front of everyone and kiss her feet? I wouldn't have as much of a problem with it, if it just wasn't in front of so many people...

My friend and I(may), went to the amusement park for a school trip, since we did good all year.

20090131115744AABANkG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need girl's opinions. What should I do?	There's like 10 girls that like me. I can't pick one to go out with. I'm afraid I'm gonna hurt the other girls' feelings if I start going out with one person. I don't wanna go out with all of them either (duh). What should I do?
20090131114909AAXzfbG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this guy really like me or is he just a player?	I'm 16 years old and this guy is a year older than me. We started texting each other about 2 years ago through a friend and we have never met or talked on the phone but once. he used to flirt with me a lot, but i always had a feeling he was just a player. but before summer started he found out i had a boyfriend and he freaked out cuz he said he thought i knew how much he loved me. but i had no idea he was actually serious about anything since i thought he was a player and all. We got through that but he stopped talking to me for a few months (summer and a little into school). i asked him why but he said it was cuz he got a new phone and had forgotten my number. and now that we are talking again he says how much he is still in love with me (not just like or love but "IN" love) and it kind of freaks me out. is this guy for real or what? cuz i cant tell!!! he is so cute and all these girls like him and he is sooo sweet. oh and he lives really far away and goes to a different school. soooo some of my friends say its either A. he likes the sound of talking to this mysterious girl that he cant actually have or B. He actually does like me.  sooo pretty much the real question is....is it really A or B? or something else entirely? thanks so much for your input =]

20090131115608AANWwR7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need a guys opinion ASAP PLEASE!!!!!!!?	ok, so my boyfriend and i broke up 2 days ago. i think it was because we started fighting A LOT because i admit, i was being grumpy and taking it out on him. i shouldn't have. anyways, he started losing feelings for me so we broke up and he said if he started to like me again he would let me know and we could try it out again.   so he's coming over in like 3 hours and i need to know what i should do to make him like me again.   obviously be myself..but do i be myself how i was when i was dating him (flirty and stuff)   or myself when i'm just with a guy who is strictly a friend (not flirty..)   basically should i flirt with him or play hard to get.   which would make him want me more....   thx

20090131121546AAqjf8o	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm a complete prude! Is that something guys don't like?	I'm only 17 years old, and I was raised in a Christian family with strong morals and values.       I'm a virgin, I've only kissed a guy once (a simple peck) in 6th grade. Since then, I promised to myself I wouldn't date until I was 18.       Since I'm still in high school, there are a lot of guys who constantly try to hit on me, but it's definitley not mutual. I guess I just don't want to be considered one of those "easy" girls. I want a guy to actually respect me..      It seems like the old-fashioned guys are gone now. And my friends always call me a prude and say I'm missing out.      Am I?

20090131121655AAzDcIx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really really really need your help-10 points to best answer and my eternal thanks!?	I have been seeing this boy on and off for about a year and a half.  We called it quits a few times but then got back together again.  He did move away so it's been a long distance relationship for awhile.  Anyway, at the beginning everything was great and he was my first love but I have been noticing little things that might be of concern this time around.  Such as:   1. Our relationship is open, since we can't be with eachother right now.  I asked him the other day if he was going partying and I asked him if he found a nice girl, would he think about having a relationship with her.  He said yes.  I, on the other hand, would hook up with a boy but I would never want to get involved with someone else because I love him. But I wonder if he's not being practical since she would be there? Is it wrong for me to be jealous? If he really cared for me, would he consider having a relationship if an amazing girl came along?   2. He tells me he cares for me a lot, but he rarely calls- (maybe 1/5th of the amount I do) and when we start to talk about the relationship, he switches topics (he's not comfortable with his feelings.)   3. I planned on moving up to where he is for a month. Yet all he wants to talk about when it concerns this big transition, is what great of sex we're going to have.   4. He tells me that he I am one of his closest friends and he has a big physical attraction to me (he tells me I'm hot all of the time), yet its hard to have a committed relationship with someone who's not there most of the time. He said if we were together, he would absolutely be.   5.He tells me that when I ask him to call a little more (we do talk everyday) that I make him feel like he's screwing up.      Do you think I'm putting too much effort into this?  Should I just give up?  We have amazing chemistry and I have yet to find anyone I mesh half as well with.  Is he being more reasonable than me?  Do you think he does really care for me? Is it worth the risk to move up there? Please be brutally honest.        I know this is long and I thank you for reading so much! 10 points to best answer!

I know he is online because he signs into other sites that we both have an interest in.

20090131121107AAlkQpV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I make my boyfriend face problems?	I love my boyfriend, more than anyone in the world and he means the world to me. However he is extremely stubborn and even our little fights blow out of proportion. Whenn we fight either i have to let it go, i have to ignore him for a long period of time or threaten to break up with him. However me being confrontational, i always want to solve it. I'm sick of compromising and approaching problems his way. Every time i get more and more frustrated with him because of this and every problem is a build up of all of our unresolved ones.    He was supposed to run an errand fo me today which was supposed to pick up money from me today to deposit into his account and pay for something important. However an hour before the bank closes,  an hour after he got of the work he calls me from the sauna. We both are sick however i am sicker. He said it was helping him feel better but he ditched the problem.  Now he hung up on me and wont answer my calls.    Im sick of being forced to solve problems his way, but am usually very happy with him. How to I make him face up to problems and work them out instead of running away (which is how he deals with MOST problems)

20090131120502AAscIhN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ah! this guy is driving me crazy?	Ok, first of all before you read this, I wanted to let you know I'm not one of those bad little girls who want to grow up too fast... I really am a good girl. Ok so there's this guy. I've known him since second grade, and a couple years ago, I started to really like him. He is the most popular kid in the school and he had had one gf before. So he asked me to the dance, and my parents don't let me do anything with boys until im 16 so I told him no because my parents wouldn't let me. It was so sad to say no! So he was acting really mad at me for like a year, and then he kinda became nicer. Then the next year, he went to mexico (a student exchange program) and came back with a gf. I tried not to care, and I just focused on my schoolwork. Something happened between them and they broke up.... and now this year, he had another gf, (my friend) and Idk what happened but they aren't going out anymore... and both of their statuses are single. He has been acting really nice to me lately... but I feel like I shouldn't like him. I mean hes 13 and has had three gf's. And on his face book profile his interests are 'girls' and he always talks about how cool and awesome he is. But a couple days ago he called me for homework and I was so nervous talking to him... he said thanks like three times... idk what to think!he can be so nice.... and then with his friends he acts so mean!!! Im trying not to like him..... but this crush is huge and hes the onley boy I've really 'like-liked'. What should I do?

On Sunday we kissed for the first time (and that was also my first kiss).       Before and during final exams, he was very distant towards me. We didn't even hold hands for a month. Sometimes it didn't feel like we were dating. He has ADHD. All I know is that he was having trouble in some classes and there aren't any other girls he likes. This week the 2nd semester started and we've started holding hands again. On Sunday we went on a date at skater's edge and mostly we played arcade games. He got me a little mini rose and a bracelet and like I said, we kissed! We both aren't that experienced in dating.       Yesterday at the end of the day, he just got on the shuttle bus (the one that takes us to the school next door where our buses home are) before I even saw him. My friend and I ended up getting on the same bus as him and he was just reading a book and didn't notice me for a few minutes. And sometimes when we're by our other friends, I feel uncomfortable cuz he doesn't pay all that much attention to me. But other times it's the opposite. He's at his dad's this weekend and his phone doesn't work. Am I just being paranoid? No rude comments please. Thanks!

I saw a guy that I like! He was staring at me when I finally looked at him and he looked happy when I looked at him. Then he bumped into me, lightly. Also he does this every day. He sits as close to me as possible too. What was he thinking about when this happened?

20090131130513AAucHDy	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I think my fiance is gay ........?	I think my fiance might be gay and is just with me so his family won't think wrong of him. He likes girly music like lilix, slow songs by TLC, beyonce, beegees, i don't know like 60's music? I don't know of any 20 year old guy that listens to that.  No, Im not trying to choose music for him but it's weird. He's very sensitive and stuff. He never wants to have sex, I mean I know im prego but im not huge or anything.  He would rather watch porn by himself instead of with me. I mean I could do myself and he can do himself that's all there is to it. He will always delete everything he see's on the comp I mean it's not like I'm gonna go in and check what he does.    Can you guys tell me what signs I can look for that indicate he's gay?? Please I don't want to marry him him if neither of us is happy. :(

20090131130221AA3FO5U	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think my parents will be mad about this?	There's this guy I've known for a couple of years,we met through a mutual friend.I usually see this guy only about 3 times a year,since he lives in a town about 45 minutes away.Recently I found his Myspace,through our friend's page.I sent this guy a friend request,and he accepted it.That was about a week ago.Now we've been talking a lot on myspace.We haven't actually talked at the same time,since we're never on at the same time.But we send messages to each other and then the other one of us will reply.We've been talking about meeting up and doing something,including our friend and probably my brother,too.So it wouldn't actually be just us.And the first message he sent me,he asked if I had a cell phone number so he could put me in his contacts when he got one.I don't have a cell phone yet,so I didn't have a cell number to give him.But I did give him my home phone number,and he gave me his.And we've got each other on our top friends,too.    I don't think anything of this,since I know we're just friends.But my parents don't want me dating for a long time,since I'm only about to be 15.And this guy is 18.And when I mentioned to my mom that if I ever got a cell phone(since my parents say the reason I can't get a phone yet is 'cause I don't have anyone to call)that I could call this guy,hoping she would say yes.Then she told me she didn't want me calling any guys on it.So I'm afraid they would be suspicious if they knew I was talking to this guy on myspace and that we had exchanged phone numbers,even though nothing is going on.    Sorry this is so long,I just don't want my parents getting mad just because I'm e-mailing a guy,especially one I don't see face-to-face very often.If you were a parent,would you be okay about this?Mine are pretty strict.

Lately, he's been distant with me.  We don't talk or spend time as frequently as we used to.  We did talk about it and I told him that I noticed that he's been different.  He told me that he was just really stressed about work and other things that were going on his life and that he it had nothing to do with me.  Is this how men usually react in a stressful situation?  Do I take his word for it?  Should I forget about him?  Should I just give him space?  I don't want to contact him and keep asking me because I know that would push anybody away.  Thanks alot for your help!

20090131131350AAt6uQ6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Told a girl my feelings....Was it the right thing?	I live in a rural town, and a couple weeks ago I met the ONLY girl in town on myspace.  She's very nice, cute, and I like her a lot.  We met in person yesterday for the first time.  We watched a couple movies and just hung out for a while.  It was a little awkward but I just blame that on nerves.  We talked some, but before we actually met in person, we talked on the phone a few times, which was much easier for both of us.  I had fun, and she says she did too.      So this morning, I sent her a message on myspace, telling her that I was really attracted to her and like her a lot.  I just had a gut feeling that I should tell her how I feel before I am trapped as "just a friend" forever.  Should I have waited and gotten to know her better as a friend?  Or is it better to just start off letting her know your intentions?  I tried not to pressure her, and said I'd still love to be friends either way.      If she is attracted to me, and likes me romantically, I guess I'll up the ante a bit and ask her for a more formal date.  If she doesn't like me, have I ruined all chances of friendship?

We were pretty close, and I really have been wishing he'd take me back, although I haven't spoken to him since the breakup.  I've had this dream sequence and i have No idea what it means, if anything. can anyone help me out?      Night 1: Dreamt about my ex taking me back, but still treating me like ****, like he did the entire time we were dating (don't ask me why I still want him back, I couldn't tell you.  attachment maybe?)   Night 2: Dreamt I was at his sisters' place and she asked how me and brent were doing, i told her we broke up.  she got really mad and said she'd have to talk to him because I was the best thing that ever happened to him (which he did tell me on occasion while we were dating)   Night 3: Complete skip to a different person.  Dreamt about a guy I was seeing, who had a girlfriend (don't be hatin', i didn't know he had a girlfriend until a few weeks late,r at which point i broke it off).  anyway, in this dream i didn't know he had a girlfriend and it was just like we were dating   Night 4: Dreamt the same guy again, except this time he told me if i slept with him, he'd dump his ex-girlfriend and date me.     Night 5: COMPLETE turn of events: dreamt my parents and brother died and I was left in the care of some people who owned a horse ranch (random hey??)   Night 6: dreamt about this guy i've been talking to lately.  It was a really short dream, where we were just sleeping in his bed, he woke me up with a kiss on the cheek and said "good morning, beautiful".  then I woke up.      So what does this all mean??

I know (I've heard) it is pretty hard for some boys to ask out a girl, like for the first time. How do we make it easier for you to show you we like you, and its okay to ask.      Especially since I know he likes me, and I secretly like him back.  Still I think he doesnt know (since I tend to hide it).   Thank you!      P.S. I know I could always just ask if I like him and know he likes me, I just feel better if he does the asking, cause I'm a little traditional.

20090131124645AA62wc4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Adults Only: Surprising Sex Health News: Men Who Drink Are Better in Bed ?	This study sort of blew my mind. Researchers suggest that alcohol improves (instead of dampens) a man's sexual performance. Pass him a beer and keep reading...    Everyone's heard that too much booze can make it, um, hard for men to perform in the sack, but a study of 1,580  men found that moderate drinkers had 30 percent fewer erectile dysfunction(ED) problems than teetotalers. Even binge drinkers had lower rates of ED than those who never drank. (Public service announcement: Binge drinking causes a whole host of other health problems, so please don't tell your man to go on a bender.)..LOL    Researchers found that, compared to those who have never touched alcohol, many people do benefit from some alcohol, including some people who drink outside the guidelines. Men who drank up to 20 drinks per week appeared to have the best erectile function    What do you think about this study? Does having a few drinks help your honey perform better in the sack? Or do you think that the opposite is true?

I have the biggest crush on this girl at school    Im 17 shes 15    Been flirting with each other for a few months now    locked eyes and smile whenever we see each other    Dont't get to talk much due to age difference round school (Once a week)       I told her how i felt and asked her out    She said no because her dad wont let her have a boyfriend (I already knew her dad was strict)    She said i was cute and loves how i make her laugh    We still lock eyes with each other and smile like everyday    Whenever we are in the same room she always comes closer to me IE moves over to be next to me or walks really close past me in the corridors.      Another good example was the other day when she was on her own looking out the window and as i was walking down the hallway towards her we both locked eyes and smiled, to which i went up to her and started talking! It was so inviting to do so :D       I REALLY like her which she obviously knows BUT do you think shes interested in me?

20090131131249AA41fNZ	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Why do people think we look like sisters?	Why do people say my mom is hot? All my guy friends say that they think my mom looks like a milf and that she looks 25 and all this stuff it makes me uncomfortable because they say things about her, it is just weird. Is it normal to have a hot mom? Can you be thought of as hot if your hot mom is around? lol And then everyone tells me we look like sisters, but it's my mom. I'm just wondering about this because I don't see the resemblance.     http://i96.photobucket.com/albums/l174/j...    She's wearing the red, I'm wearing the black.

20090131124744AAaVgqW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys - if you acted this way about a girl, would it mean you like her more than just a sex fling?	after being with her a few times...and  you still watched her in a crowded room, even when you talked with other girls. If you looked at her as though you were looking out for her when she talked with other guys. (if she was at the bar alone that night)      If her friend said a joke about her being pregnant (before you ever slept with her) and your jaw hit the floor and you started walking slowly like you'd seen a ghost.      just lots of interest in her when she's around she has your attention more than anyone. Do you just like her a lot, or does she mean anything to you?
20090131125037AAaoEP8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Immature girlfriend, but I love her. What can I do?	My girlfriend and I are in our early 30's. We communicate well, share similar social/political views, and are the best of friends. But when it comes to some of the fundamental basics of an adult lifestyle I feel like she becomes an emotional/intellectual child.   She doesn't meet me halfway when it comes to basic chores and household responsibilities, such as cooking, cleaning, tidying, leaving lights on, etc.    She is a survivor, sweet kind woman, physically attractive, and totally unobtrusive. Very easy to like. But she's indirect, conniving, and incredibly needy. Needy in the sense that more often than not I have to do all the interpersonal work, carrying the conversation, problem solving, and so on.   Worst off when it comes to sex, she has this elaborate fairy tale ideal that it's always some prize to be begrudgingly given at the end of a crusade. I'm a spontaneous, creative, expressive articulate lover. Her misconceptions about sex do nothing but frustrate and infuriate me. Once again, she doesn't meet me half way by engaging in a mutually beneficial and enjoyable adult experience.   We both entered into this relationship with lots of problems. I'm a deeply flawed person and her love and friendship means a lot to me. What can I do?

I sent him an email saying that I want to see him soon... it was Wed. then today is Sat. and I havn't heard a word from him yet.

Say you and your boyfriend/ girlfriend had a big argument, you showed up at there place unannounced. He/she hurts you by shaming you telling you to leave, they want nothing to do with you,literally made you feel incredibly bad, and this was done with a family member of theirs around....later on down the person says the reason they acted that way, was to show you that you are not to just show up, and refuses to apologize because they claim they are trying to make a point. Would you be ok, with what the person did, even though they made you feel bad, and refuses to apologize, or would you be upset and end the relationship?

20090131125008AAv7X0g	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Was he only interested in sex?	i had this friend who lived 3 hours away. he said how much he missed me, and so last weekend he drove up to see me. We were also with my best friend and this guy's best friend. But almost the whole day all this guy  talked about was sex, and he kept making comments to me. he had his hands all over me, and one time when i was laying down relaxing in the backseat, he jumped on top of me and wrapped his arms around me and started humping me (dry-humping..clothes were all on) and even when i tried to push him off, he didn't get off I yelled at him. But everyone else laughed and it got played off as a huge joke. And he just kept being gross, saying stuff like "I'd eat you out" and  if I said something to offend him he would say "don't make me climb back there (i was in the backseat) and shove my d*ck down your throat....thats your punishment, but you'll like it. ;)"    He used to be my best friend and he never used to be like this. it hurts because I ended the friendship because he was too forward. He keeps texting me saying that it was all a joke and I have to learn to be less serious and just saying that I'm a b*tch and stuff. so my question is...was he only interested in sex from the beginning and why did he suddenly act like this?

20090131125339AAK2gRN	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Friends of the opposite sex?	This kinda goes along with my house guest question.  I am an engaged woman, who lives with her fiance.  I have few friends that are female.  Most of the really good long term friends I have are male and this bothers my fiance.  Well, it doesn't really bother him until I want to go hang out with my friends.        I know everyone says that guys are only friends with girls because they want to bang them, and I probably could have any one of them if I wanted, but I don't and never have.  Any guy I'm attracted to automatically is removed from the friend pile because I don't need that kind of complication in my life.  I love my fiance, and we have been together for more than 10 years.  He says that it has nothing to do with me personally but with his own insecurity, which I get, but I still feel like I am being held back from socializing with the people that I like to spend time with.  Is this a normal reaction to your other half having friends of the opposite sex?  If you have had this problem, did you resolve it? How? Did you have to give up your friends? or could you make them see that it is perfectly innocent.  Also, most of them drink, but I don't, so the 'drunken mistake' doesn't really apply.

20090131125321AAxxJwi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Hey guys can you help with this please its URGENT!?	please help me      hey guys now im hoping u cud help me with this it maybe a bit long but it is worth the read. now there is this guy that i know and ever since last february we have been flirting with each other. it all started whenever i was going through a stressful period at school and home and since he was my friend he was comforting me and helping me through it. now after that he started asking me for my mobile number but i would not give it to him but after about 2 months of him asking me for it my friend gave it to him so we started texting each other as friends like. then it started to get a bit more friendly in school by flirting even more with each other (well he actually did most of the flirting). well then it was time for my GCSEs and we didnt really see each other as often because i was on study leave but i saw him at break and lunchtimes whenever i was in school and so we had a good laugh. we didnt really talk during the summer because i was away in scotland for most of the summer. then everything started up again in september whenever i saw him after college because he lives round the corner from me. now in october past we sort of had a little fling going on because he had tried to get me round to his house that much whenever i was still at the same school but i would not go round but in october i agreed i would go around to his but not for long. it was very obvious that he fancied me and i started to like him more than a friend as well. we arranged it via text message because it was easier. so whenever it came to the day for me to go round to his i went round and we were talking just about random things for a good half hour then he came over towards me and kissed me. i wasnt really shocked about it cause i knew it would have happened sooner or later. so we were kissing each other until i had to go and that was about half hour after he first kissed me. we then started to go out but it was kept a secret cause we didnt want anyone to know but my best mates knew bout it because tehy knew he liked me for ages. but about 3 weeks later we spilt up for alot of different reasons but we stayed friends. then i started to go out with my ex but we spilt up 1. because it wasnt working out 2. the age difference 3. mi parents. but i noticed that whenever i was with mi ex he seemed like he was trying to win me back. so recently we started flirting with each other again but the problem is he isnt arranging anything through me it always seems to be through my mate and that is making me think is he worth it but then i had to cancel alot of times there recently going to the cinema but it wasnt actually my fault because me and my mum had a big argument and that affected my social life there for a while. now i found out there today that he thinks that i am using him and that i do not like him anymore, but he seems to have got it all wrong because i still do like him and im not using him. we have planned to go to the cinema in a couple of weeks (of course via my mate cause he wont talk to me about it). so now i am just really confused because i dont know what to do anymore. can u give me some advice. sorri if it is a essay but it is the only way to say what is going on.      by the way just to let you know im 16 and he is 14/15 can't remember which 1. he is still at secondary school in 4th year and i have now started college which would be lower 6th      i reli need your advice on this one

20090131132213AAm0hPn	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Awkward situation, what to do in a cliché love triangle?	My two close friends have just broken up, but it's a bit more difficult than that:       they're in the same form, and see each other every morning for half hour. They've been an item for the last couple of weeks, and HE was planning to take HER for dinner on Friday. Their last lesson was Physics, and SHE had a free so came along (she also takes physics). As it turns out, SHE has a crush on SOMEONE else as well as HIM, and has liked that SOMEONE else for years. HE thought she'd be over him by now seeing as HE just joined the school, and was made aware of this beforehand. She left the physics lesson really quickly, so HE text HER to ask when SHE has to be back tonight. SHE replied that SHE wasn't sure about that night, and SHE still needs time to sort HER head out, as SHE realized in physics, he got a text later saying "we could be happy if that SOMEONE wasn't there", but they are, and he's confused.      Seeing as we're all in the same friendship group, this is ever so awkward and I also have no idea what to do, nor do my two friends.

One second it was perfect, then whie i was cheering at a 49ers game and got back on the bus i had a message from his best friend telling me that he doesnt want to be with me anymore and that hes got a new girl. It's been about 3 months and everytime i see him with her it crushes me more and more. I've neevr been able to get over him. Last weekend, he texted me and told me he wants me back and he made a mistake and im way better than this new girl. I'm so torn. When we were together, he treated me like a princess. When I got that message from him, i was at a party and i ran outside sat in the front yard and cried and called my friend that doesnt live in the same town for help. I want to feel like a princess again, but my friends are telling me that hes no good for me and i need to move on. I just cant seem to make a decision. HELP me please!

20090131124249AAvL4eB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girl Trouble, should I end it?	OK, I have alot to explain so bare with me. But I would love help ASAP.   I have changed some names, so that if any of my mates see this they might not understand who I am on about.      Basicly, I am 16, almost 17. I go to the local College.      There is this girl in one of my classes called Emma, now she is (in my opinion) drop-dead gorgeous. She is abit emo, and as many people warned me..abit of a slag. So anyway, at the start of college she started going out with this guy called dave. They got up to stuff, you know, as couples do. To be honest i didnt care, i was looking out for other girls.       So a month or two later, me and emma started to chat, became friends easily. But then she kept getting really depressed over dave. Quite scary the things she was saying..telling me stuff about how life was ****, she had troubles at home..she had certain illnesses..not mental..im sure of that..but i didnt dare ask what they were. She used to moan that she was arguing with dave alot and that they were on the verge of spitting up, at that point me and her started to get closer. You know, flirting and all that. So finally she did brake up with dave...saying stuff like oOoOo i love you etc to me.       I wasnt sure if i had feelings for her...to be honest i was abit put off by the mood swings she had.. I just did my best to try and make her happy..i sed to my mates that i was just bothering with her for abit of action...but i still dont know..i think i was just trying to help her.      So then me and her started seeing each other..doing innocent things like kissing behind the bike shed and that..and we both agreed that we want a relationship with no strings..which is fair enough..i am slightly afraid of commitment...and she just broke up with her boy friend.      Things were going fine until yesturday, she said she was going to dave's birthday party because she is still in that 'group' of friends. I was fine with that. Then she told me on msn, that she told her mate to stop her from doing anything with dave when she is drunk. Because she doesnt want anything to happen...when she sed that...i was like...hang on...surely when you are drunk you still have some control of your actions.      So just now...one day after the party, she talks to me on msn..I asked her how the party was...      'dont remember i have mild alcohol poisoning >.< i passed out and everything." she sed...      so we starting talking about the experience until...she sed this..=[      "****...apparently me and dave had sex last night. Which i so dont remember... how can i not remember =S shittt. he shouldnt of taken advantage, especially as i was apparently drifting in and out of conciousness. im sorry john."      Now...i have no idea what to do right now...end it between us? (thats what i feel like doing right now)   or accept her apology..      Please, if you read all this..can you just give me ur opinion..thanks.
20090131124341AAD62Ux	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this considered as "cheating?"?	Me and my boyfriend were dating for about 8 or 9 months, when he broke up with me for about a week, then we ended up getting back together. During the period of us being broken up, he had sex with another girl, he says it was out of anger because of the reason why he broke up with me, which i don't think makes any sense. We ended up getting back together, so is that cheating?       I think that because we got back together, and he went so long without telling me what happened, it was cheating. I just found out about this yesterday, any advice on what to do?   Is this considered cheating? :(

20090131124827AAuq3wx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	PLEASE! TELL ME HOW TO DEAL WITH THIS. WHAT SHOULD I DO? WHAT IF SHE COMES BACK LATER?	What should I do now? How can I forget about my ex-girlfriend?   I had a 2year relationship with a sweet and beautiful girl. We had a wonderful relationship until she moved to another city with her family. I told her I was going to go with her next semester, and she was the one that motivated me telling me that the relationship was going to work even at a distance. I was so happy because I felt that she really loved me and cared for this relationship. She even sent me letters and postcards through mail saying that she missed me and loved me, and when someone does all those kind of things it's hard to think they are going to do anything that can hurt you really bad. I called her everyday and our conversations were great until one day I noticed her a little weird and our conversations were very short, she didn't want to talk to me anymore. She was always tired, so I asked what was wrong with her and she started arguing telling me to stop complaining when I was just asking for some affection. Then she grabbed this argument as an excuse to break up with me before thanksgiving, so now she was not going to come on that weekend as she promised. Then 3 weeks later I found out that she was already in a relationship with other guy (I also found out the he was telling her lies about me like "you are here and he's there, he's going to cheat on you" etc, while I was just studying, working, and waiting for the moment to be with her again). Her younger brother told me that she was already going out with him for a while (before breaking up with me) and the reason why she broke up with me before thanksgiving was because she invited the guy to eat dinner with her family; the sad part about this is that in my 2 years of relationship with her, she never invited me to meet her parents. After that I stopped talking to her, then she called me to supposedly apologize but it was mainly to ask me something and I asked why she did that when she was the one telling me not to cheat on her and that this relationship was going to work. She told me that she was not in a relationship with anyone, that she and I were friends and we could be together in a future but that for now I had to forget about her, that what we had was really beautiful but it just didn't worked out.      How do you forget 2 years that easily? How a person that sweet and lovely turned into that? She got rid of me like if I was an obstacle and now it's like if I never existed.      The worse part is that I still love her and can't forget about her.      I've tried everything to stop thinking about her. The only thing that I feel it works is going to the gym but it's only temporary, once I arrive home or drive anywhere around the city, my memories come to me. Everything reminds me of her. What can I do?

20090131130103AAe4wDn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do I have any shot at being with him after coming on so strong and giving in when I was drunk?	Ok this is a really confusing and complex situation and I need some guys point of view on this but ladies feel free to help ;) I've been friends with this great guy for about a year now and we go to college together.   Initally I wasn't that attracted to him, but he did kind of seem into me and when a friend tried fixing us up I was honest and told him I saw him as just a friend, There is a big age difference between us (I'm 27, he's 22 but doesn't act like it) and he knew I liked another guy, so of course he never really asked me out. We would go places with our friends, would talk on the phone every once in a while and would talk in school all the time but that was it...we never got really close    One day though, I flirted through text just to flirt and have fun cuz i did think he was cute (but because of the age thing I was reluctant) but one night I figured what the hell? Well he flirted back and we started getting a little closer. All of a sudden we were talking almost every day & flirting a lot, or we texted and he started inviting me places but I never went b/c I knew there was a good chance he was trying to use me for sex.   I started to get really into him and never went on those dates b/c I tried not rush and take it slow.  It didn't take me long before I started finding out how truly amazing he is and realized he's one of the most accomplished people I know and he's only 22! I ended up getting carried away and started coming on TOO strong. One minute I'm not going on dates with him b/c of trying not to rush things, and the next min I was coming onn way too strong,was texting him too much and was asking him if I could join him places he never actually invited me to ;(  He would agree to go with me to the places that I asked, but we never went because I was freaking him out & didn't even realize it. It didn't take long before he started avoiding me and I asked him one day what was wrong and he told me to slow down, that I was going too fast.     So I did just that and backed WAY off. We went about 2 weeks with out talking or seeing each other but then met up accidentally at a friends party.   When I first saw him I kept my cool and just said hey to him and he gave me a big hug and talked to me a LITTLE at first...but once them drinks started rollin in he started being GLUED to me.  It shocked the hell out of me that here we were not talking because he told me I was coming on too strong, and now HE was.   I even asked him about it and he looked in my eyes and apologized for backing away like he did and promised he wouldn't do it again (which he hasn't) He wasn't sloppy drunk so I figured he really meant what he said (and all the other sweet things he said) and I bought into it... but what I didn't buy into was having sex with him (at least not right away)  The guy tried & tried all night and I resisted going all the way all night (which was so hard) but eventually I did. Afterwards.he held me and rubbed my back and we looked into each others eyes and fell asleep together.    Well when he left the next morning after we had sex again (yes its bad I know) he kissed me bye and said he's call me.... but when I didn't hear from him the rest of the day after I sent a few short sweet texts- I started to get a lil worried that he had used me or maybe regretted what we did (which would pretty much take back all the sweet things he said)  I eventually got to talkt 2him about it and sure enough he told me that he kind of regrets what happened and that he was too drunk to know what he was doing ;(     I have made a lot of mistakes with this guy, obviously, and I was wondering if any of you could tell me if I have any kind of chance of us fixing this and how do we?  We took the first step and we have both admitted to each other that we both messed up and he even said he would take all the blame for it. Plus we still see each other in school all the time and make small talk but do you think I have any chance of making this work? ;(      I know he's young but I care about him so much and I'm not sure why I do sometimes but I want to back off & do what it takes to fix this if I can.    I realize there's a good chance he took advantage of the situation and is blaming it on the alcohol as a way out, I know thats possible, but the fact that we were JUST friends for so long doesn't that count for anything? I know he sees me as something other than sex but at this point Do I have any shot at being with him after coming on so strong and hooking up when I was drunk? Please you guys any advice ;( Thanks

20090131133811AADQ5nR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My girlfriend didn't tell me one of my good internet friends was quiting, should I be concerned? ?	She told me she didn't tell me because she was stupid and jealous. I didn't know quite what to make of it. My girlfriend is rather needy but she doesn't say anything, or make me do stuff, she just cries when she's feeling needy I guess. *scratches head confused* like I'll start talking about me going out an doing something an how fun it was, an she'll get quieter, an quieter until she has to hold back the tears. It makes me so confused. Because she seems genuinely hurt when she can't have me 100% of the time. An she tries not to cry in front of me, but she does, a LOT. I told her she was overwhelming me, and now she refuses to talk to me about anything after that, she won't say anything when I ask her how her day was, she won't tell me how she's feelings. I went from being totally overwhelmed to feeling like she is emotionally shutting me out. An I told her that, an I told her we need to talk through this stuff, an she said that she's just trying to make me happy, an left it at that. *Sighs* sometimes I think she is so afraid of losing me that we can't communicate. We've never had an argument, but sometimes I wish we would just so I know what's going on in her head.

20090131134549AA3lhAn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really need some advice - do you want 10 points?!?	I was at the library today for two reasons. First off, I had some work. Second, I heard there are quality girls there. Well, there were tons of quality girls! My goodness, it was like Hotties-r-us in that library.    This one girl, wow, she was cute... Back on track, she worked there and I was going to ask her about her job because I was going to apply (fake!). I was about to go, and I froze up.     Here are my two questions:  1) For girls, if you're at the library working, how do you feel about guys talking to you and/or asking for your number?    2) How's this for an ice-breaker, lol: "I happen to have my library card, so can I check you out? I'm just kidding, I don't actually have my library card." Haha, never mind.     Thank you for reading and, hopefully, answering!

I was talking to her again earlier and i was telling her how i have been in the hospital since tuesday. She asked me if i was going back to school or to my parents. When i told her school she asked if i was alone taking care of myself and i should let her know if i needed anything or even just company.      Then we were talking online and when she said she had to go she said "here let me give you my number, text me sometime"      is she interested? how should i start this possible relationship?

20090131172147AAkjbxy	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Love is hard to find?	For a while now I have been without a girlfriend. My last relationship ended in January of 08. It just seems like every time I look for someone, it either doesn't work out at all or I get some one that I don't really want. I dated for a while too, but I'm done with that now, since all of my dates either lose interest or I lose interest or we both lose interest. A lot of people tell me to just wait for it, and it will come along. But I don't know what to do. Should I continue to date? Or should I just "wait" for some one to come along?
20090131132632AAIS8qW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is with this girl?	I go to college and ive known this girl for a couple years.  I see he almost everyday, and we hang out in the same group of friends often.  But it seems like whenever its just the two of us, she is quiet towards me, but she seems to have little trouble striking up a conversation with most other guys.     Sometimes, she'll have a lot to say and we'll have a really nice conversation, but more often than not, if i dont ask her something she wont say anything to me at all.     This has been bothering me for a while, i think she's really nice and everything and i might like to ask her out, but im not sure what her reaction would be.  I was wondering what others think, because we are around the same group of friends a lot, i dont want to make things even more akward between us if she doesnt like me at all.

We are both 17,& a few months ago without telling me one of my friends ask one of her friends who she likes and her friend said sum guy from another school, then he asked another friend and the friend said she likes no one and is waiting for that special guy, which now makes no sense to me and im confused.       (Earlier this year she told me to write I luv her in my msn nick cause it would be funny:S then the she did the same for hers. ppl started asking us if were dating then she said she when I asked her why she removed her nick she said because she was tired of people asking if we were dating:S, On facebook she left a message on facebook and had bro in it.      We started talking less after prom & for A week in the summer she had a Bf but I didnt really think she liked him that much because her msn name was the same while his was he loved her and less than a week after she broke up with him.This summer we didn't really talk until she left me a message on facebook telling"Wats Up Long Lost Home Dog I miss U with Smily Faces ,      Recently She started saying Hi to me less but in gym I see her looking at me alot, .and recently when she says hi she makes her best friend say it to, also if she sees me talking with sum1 she will wait till Im done and she will say she woulda said hi earlier but didnt want to interpt me,& when I walk bye her class she will call me and wave with her cute smile:).       *I was at my bustop 2day and when she saw me she yelled my name so then I went to go talk 2 her , she then asked me if I get annoyed that she says Hi everytime she sees me and I said no its np. And when I got on the bus her & her best friend saved me a seat.

OK i am often in situations where a girl will ask me to keep an eye on her drink or her handbag whilst she goes to the ladies, or girls at a bus stop late at night will pretend to be with me to scare off the drunks.

I don't think he knows I like him or anything, but we are friends. Well he says we are friends. And we hang out at school a lot. We used to text all the time. And for some reason or another, we sort of quit talking for about a month and a half. And I saw him at a Homecoming dance and he flirted with me for a little while. Then we started talking again and its all good. every time he sees me, he sings Don't Trust Me (by 3Oh!3). He found out I liked it from a friend and its his fave song too. It is just so funny and I love that song. But like the other day he texted me lyrics from that song and i texted him some back, then we started talking. And it wasn't about anything uncomfortable or anything, but I texted him today and he wouldn't text back. And a few hours later I texted him again and still no reply. My question is, what are some of the possible reasons he isn't texting me? We still talk at school?

It was my decision to leave him outside so he could not be couped in the house all day.  Scooter's hind legs have been paralyzed for about two months now.  We have to take care of him like a baby.  He acts normal and playful,  but he just does'nt have his hind legs working.        We get home around seven pm and it's dark and no sign of scooter.  There was no way he could have gotten out by himself.  The gate was closed.  So my girlfriend says nothing and goes upstairs after she cooks and puts her head down and sits in the office quietly.       I look everywhere for him, ask neighbors etc...  no sign of scooter.  3am in the morning, "bark bark"  he arrives by my car and my gf hears him.  I put on my clothes and there he is.  He came back home!  None the less my gf is still angry.        Since that day she has stayed in her room studying and surfing the internet.  We sleep in separate rooms by the way.  I ask her what is going on and she says that she's "tired" I ask tired of?  Are you physically tired, mentally tired, what is it?  She said "take a guess, I'm tired of all this"?        "This" means the current situation of not being to rent the house out, not being able to get the roof fixed from hurricane ike, not being able to get her a car, that I burned the engine up using it as a work car.  School.  Shes about to graduate college.  She's 41 and hormonal; hot and cold, moody and nice.  I accept her as she is.  We've not been intimate in almost a year.        I'm doing what I can in this situation.  I started a business that's slow, but business is picking up.  I'm a month from getting my car out the shop so she will have one soon.  In the meantime we have to share one car which is'nt bad, but it gets annoying after a while.        Since then I've taken her snacks that she took and breakfast.  She has eaten them all.        I check in on her and she looks like a zombie.   I asked her if she wants me to leave, or what.  Maybe it was the wrong question to ask in that situation at hand, but i'm trying here.  I don't think that's the case because she speaks of us in the future tense.  That means getting another house, and we joke about me taking care of here when she's old because she's ten years older than me.        Something tells me to leave her alone in her room and give her space, which is what I'm doing.  I also want to talk to her, but I tried that the other day.  She only talks when she wants to talk.        I don't want to leave her because she would have no car.  I want to stay and work it out.  Am I being a fool and not recognizing the issues here.        I've tried to offer help to rent the house.  I called a guy to look at the roof for tomorrow.  So I am taking care of business,  it is not moving fast, but I'm trying.        Your thoughts please,      Thanks

20090131143024AAh9K5A	Family & Relationships;Friends	Don't think i fit in with this group. . . ?	i moved friendship groups in december because i wasn't happy with these ppl. The new group that i moved to accepted me and didn't make me feel left. I already knew before i moved into this group that they sumtimes got involved with alcohol but i'm not into that so i would just miss those parts out if they ever did have a drunk fest and whatever.   But only this week the plan was that all of us were going ice skating (the leader of this group decided on this) and we were going to hers to stay the night. That evening, i got told that the plan had changed and we were gunna hang around in a village to get pissed which is not what i wanted to do and i showed that.They kept on persuading me but in the end, i still went skating with sum ppl but i think the leader of group isn't happy with me..the sleepover got moved to today and ppl are now staying at hers tonight.And no one told me that the sleepover was tonight.   I'm just annoyed cos i just feel like i stand out now..because i don't want to get involved in that stuff and make an idiot of myself on the streets late at night. They were all going to lie to their parents that they were goin sumwhere else as well..but the leader of this group said that having this sort of fun at night and things is what normal teens do :S   i just feel a bit left out at the mo cos of this alcohol situation, and the fact that the leader left me out of their sleepover tonight (someone who is at hers keeps on saying how brilliant it is and i'm just thinking 'umm yeh good for you :-/ )    But i know this is going to happen again and i'm gonna have to say that its not my thing...but i just worried that i am just gunna drift out of the group because i am not like them. And its hard to move groups cos they are fab at skl and things and i am much happier but this alcohol outing just got to me.   Anyone been in this situation or wants to comment about this is??..i will even give points.i just wanted to tell someone lol     thankss :)

20090131132338AANZ3WP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	10 easy points- does he like me?	I'm in love with my teacher and i know you're gonna say 'no you're not, it's just a crush' but that's not my question. i think that he might like me and you can think it's ridiculous and illegal and what not but that's not my question either. i want you to honestly tell me if you think he likes me without including the facts that it's against the law, he can get in trouble, it's impossible for us to be together and all that bull...      somehow he always ended up around me- coincidence or fate i dont know but whenever i looked at him i'd notice him 'noticing me'. and that didn't happen once or twice, it would happen all the time. we went to six flags and he walked with me and my friend so we're not 'alone' but aside from just walking us he stayed with the group. we had a dance and he told me that he knows that there's one guy in the room that wants to dance with me and i knew that none of the guys wanted to, the one guy who might have wanted to dance with me wasn't at the dance so i wondered if he could've meant himself. i stayed after school and talked to him about everything that i've been through and was going through, and he trusted me with things about him that if i were a teacher i wouldn't tell most students about. well, i moved from that school, and i went out with a guy in my new school. i still go back to visit my old teacher so i told him about the new guy and he told me to break up with him. i said that i finally found a guy who's perfect and i can't love him because of someone else, and the teacher turned around and said that the guy i was dating wasn't perfect cause he couldn't drive. when i told my friend about it she said it sounded like the teacher was jealous and he meant that he can drive so he's perfect.      all those are a few of the things that make me think that he might like me and a few of my closest friends that would never lie to me think he likes me. aside from all those times he always teases me about all the things i do and don't do, and he made me feel really guilty about having my group at six flags leave the buses without him. do you think that he likes me or not. again i also don't wanna hear that he's probably married cause he's not.      *also resently my friend asked me if he minded me NEAR him and he said he didnt.

20090131135934AAp0SsK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do? How to explain?	Hey, so i have a problem. There is this guy who is obsessed with my girlfriend and is kinda clingy to her. He also has been calling her "babe" which is not ok to call her when she isnt his girl friend.    He's been asked by her to stop, but he doesnt. This bothers me,a lot. I don't think it's a good thing to be talking with the guy who is obsessed with her, also he shows no respect for her by not stopping when she asked if he would not call her "babe". She is not interested in him at all, and he needs to back off in my opinion. He needs to realize they are just friends and stop being clingy and acting as though they have something.       What do you think? What should i do?

20090131134629AALlwPc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do about him?	okay i like this guy, i'll call him tom for this.    actually i really really really like this guy, i've known him for well over 2 years but we haven't really started to fool around since recently since he was in a relationship for over a year. the girl that he was with was also a girl that i didn't get on with, the first time i met her she was totally repulsive to me. so i don't really admire her all that much. they broke up in december and she started to see another guy that was also toms mate, so he was very upset about that. even though i wasn't fond of his ex i could see that he made her happy and he was heart broken when they broke up. she now screws him around saying that she loves him, but when he gets to her house she tell him to do one or **** off and that, you know you get the idea. and like he's like in love with her still i think, and then he went all suicidal, which is pretty pathetic if you ask me. and like now i really like him. he's pretty easy to talk to and that. and we've erm fooled around alot. and he's so cute and lovely. he's difficult to talk to in some ways cause he's difficult lol. what should i doooo?
20090131135624AAuK5kM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I dont know if i like him?	okay well there's this guy at my skool. he's mexican. he's been dating this other girl but now he's single. he's been with a couple of girls. i dont really know if i like him cause.   1. he's been with others alot.   2. other gils in my calss are like in love!    3. i dont want competition.   he's hot. i guess he flirts with me. ex. me and my friends were having a mini snowball fight and him and my friends bf came. but my friend wasnt there. it was my other friends. whenever some one asks him if he likes anyone he says "no" so i dont know if i like him.
20090131132808AAOsZye	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I Dont Know What to Do...?	My parents didnt approve of my boyfriend... so they made me break up with him.      i cried all night. i love him, he loves me. but my parents say im too young to be making my decisions off of him. but hes so perfect. he protects me from everything and everyone. he puts my happiness before his. hes the only person that can make me genuinely happy. We'll be seperated anyway in four months, so i figured that ill have a good time with him while i could so i had good memories to live off of. but then my parents got all mad at me and now im not allowed to be with him at all. i miss him so much. i think he thinks i wanted to break up with him, but... i didnt, my parents made me.       last night, i did some stupid things. i cried all night, i got really mad at myself, and i cut myself up pretty badly. i dont like being upset. and i want to tell him how i feel.      but now he wont talk to me, ive been trying to get a hold of him all day, but he wont talk to me. how do i tell him how i feel?      also, our friend was talking to him, and she said he said that he was feeling dizzy and felt like he was gonna pass out. im so sad without him. and im worried he'll hurt himself... he has a history of hurting himself... so im worried. how can i talk to him and tell him how i feel?

20090131140440AAbXFvT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He lied. how do I let it go and move forward? ?	I have been seeing this man for over 2 years now.  When he and I met, we both were in unhappy marriages and had just seperated from our spouses.  We had a past together from high school and now found ourselves connected by common problems.  He knew of my fears of finishing the divorce. doubts that i could make it on my own, that my kids would be ok. so i dragged my feet on getting the divorce finalized and he knew why. he told me he had filed and that it was in the process. he then told me when it was finalized and showed me some papers. but i didn't check to make sure they were signed. 1 year later, i find out he did file, but never finalized it.I found out through his aunt that she was never served. they lived states away from eachother, but he also lied to me about their contacts and he did go to her home to see the kids on several occasions and lied to me about his whereabouts, he admitted to having sex with her on one occasion about 10 months ago, but claims he couldn't go through with it. yeah, i don't believe that one either.  He also lied about stupid things that he didn't have to lie about because he says he didn't want to put doubt in my head. he claims that he lied to me because my flipflopping about finalizing my divorce scared him and he didn't want to be alone. He said he loves me and is doing everything he can now to show me he realizes he messed up.  on one hand i understand the fears that come with divorce. I've been there. but i never lied to him about my feelings or intentions. I now feel manipulated and deceived. I love him and our relationship. we have alot in common and enjoy eachother's company. but how do i move passed the lies and learning to trust that what he says is true.  I know that our circumstances created alot of confusion and chaos, but I didn't lie to him because I didn't want to lead him on.  I won't promise someone something that I can't give.  He seems sincere and does appear to be trying very hard.  He is trying to get the divorce finalized, but there has been some trouble with the lawyer getting things correct and moving.  I've even communicated with the lawyer's office. so I don't think this is a lie.  any advice? I can't see the forest for the trees

20090131133032AA0MNjv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he finally coming around?	I've known and sort of dated off and on this guy for about 8 years.  I've told him in the past how much I wanted to be with him but since he wasn't working at the time, he felt he didn't have anything to offer me.  For him, this is a reasonable answer but given all the other BS I've heard from guys, I sort of thought it was a cop out.      Until last night.      He asked me out on a date which is something he's NEVER done before.  We went to dinner and a movie (trust me, it may sound lame but this is HUGE for him.) and were intimate later in a way that was much more passionate than ever before.        Earlier in the week he told me that he finally landed a job with a 5 year contract.        So now, my question is, do you think he's coming around now that he's working?  He's always been fond of me but to what degree, I don't know since he's never expressed that.  My mind is stuck on this today since it was so different from any other time we've been together so I thought I'd seek opinions here.      By the way, before anyone says 'Move on! There are more fish in the sea,' I never said I wasn't still fishing.

20090131132918AApGS9r	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Walking away from someone you love. What do i do?	K well my and my gf were forced to break up in the summer cause her parents found out we had sex. Yeah short we havent seen eachother since and its really hard. I can tell she has feelings for me, but she says shes just doing what her parents want her to. Which sucks but i can see why. We didnt have a normal break up, her parents ripped us apart after being friends for almsot 3 years, and a couple for one. This all happened when we were both 17 and i just turned 18.      K so, i feel we have a loose end. We never got to say goodbye in person. She said her parents gave her a chance to, but she said it woudl hurt even to have to say goodbye. I've tried to tell her that if she meets me one time, i'll never bother her again, but everytime she says she cant cause she doesnt want to get in trouble even thought she talks to me everyday through text and AIM. So i dont get it.      I've even left her two voicemails that she said ok to beforehand. And earlier, she told me that she doesnt know how she feels about me. So i pretty much said, we have to meet, and the second she looks me in the eyes and hugs me, she'll know if she still has those feelings for me. The next day, i thought she'd bite my head off, but all she did was come to me saying how she hates her life and that no guys like her cause she thinks shes fat. So i texted her asking if she got the VM, nothing, and i IMed her later that night asking about the text, nothing didnt say a worda dn she left without saying anything.      I just want closer on this. Why would she not say anything about the VM's? I know its between two choices for me. But i want to either be able to say, ok i know she wants to be with me so i'll wait a bit longer, or ok i've put my feelings to rest and i can be happy with someone else. Please some advice. ]:

She realised that she also was getting very irriatated, and thinks its because she didnt see me for a while.    Why is this?

It is the same thing on the phone on in person he just doesn't want to work through it or let the argument run its course he will just ignore the problem and me in the process tell things blow over. Guaranteed he will call me tonight or tomorrow, act like nothing is wrong and will never mention this again. If i bring it up he will do the same thing of running away and I feel stupid holding a grudge and not letting the argument go over something so small and insignificant what is really making me made is we can't just fight about it and then kiss and make-up later.

20090131132944AApbyTM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	HELP? WHICH GUY SHOULD I PICK? Help?	Two guys I like:      1. He's really HOT and cute. He makes a huge effort to be the guy that I want. Somtimes he tries too hard to be what I want, but I really appreciate when he listens to me and remembers everything I say.  One thing I don't like is that he told me hes not a virgin and he seems to not be as dedicated to meb/c there are a lot of girls he talks about...I'm not sure      2. He's not as cute, but he's the sweetest guy. He makes me laugh and he seems to really really like me. He told me he cares about me a lot.  He always tells me he misses me and wishes he could give me a hug when I don't feel good.       WHICH ONE or NEITHER?!?!? HELP!

20090131172958AAvtajB	Family & Relationships;Friends	What kind of friend is this?! please help!?	I am friends with the new girl, well not new anymore (3 months at our school) and shes in my group of friends. So it makes 4 of us.   She seems really like a "whatever.." type person. So like laid back or doesnt really care. Today she walked all the way to my house to see if i was skating, and i said no. And she walked home. She didnt seem mad. She asks me to hang out a lot, kinda but i turn her down a lot because my parents are so b!tchy and hate me going out tons.   When i talk to her on msn, shell just sign out without saying she has to go or w/e, and idk,. She just seems like she doesnt care, if it happens it happens. She also asks for stuff a lot, like she asked me to hang out tomorrow but i told her i cant, mother is taking me shopping, and she goes get me something, im the same size as you. And she kept bringing it up like 2-3 times. :/ I am also leaving for another country next month, and she goes get me a keychain. She doesnt go have fun, shes goes get me a keychain. :/ I feel like she uses me, but she cant be using me if she also wants to hang out after school and stuff.      gah what kind of friend is that?!      my parents dont let me sleep over or go to other places late at night or till, and i kinda finally got them to be able to let me have friends sleepover at our house, but it has to be every few weeks or a month apart (stupid ikr?)      she asked to sleepover that day she came over, and im like you cant. she goes "oh thhanks, you know" like sarcasticly , she does it a lot,      Is that a good or bad thing?!
20090131132628AAXBN4H	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am a black male and only have an attraction for white females. Do others have this same attraction?	I prefer slender white women with blonde hair. I like thin lips, small breasts, and small hips on a woman. I know I will probably receive a lotta flak for asking this question but it is the truth. I don't like black women because most seem to be overweight and don't take good care of themselves like white women do.

But, to my disgust, I discovered that nearly everyone at my middle school, including a few sixth graders, are NOT VIRGINS. I want a guy who isn't a sex addict and hasn't had sex yet, but that's hard to find which is weird because I'm 13. Does anyone else think it's crazy that a lot of people 11-13 are not virgins?
20090131145302AA2tQ6V	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Relationship help?! go go go!?	okay. i need some advcie form an outsider with no involvement.   I have been best frienwds with a boy for like a year and a half, we are riddiculously close and we know have helped eahcother through a lot of stuff, his family love me and my family love him, and i've always secetly liked his brother.   i told him a couple of months back, and he told me he liked me too, so we decided to talk to Harry (my best friend) about it, and see if he'd be okay with us getting together.   We asked him and he said he was fine with it, and we got together and everything was really lovely.   then Harry staretd cuasing problems between us, and thier mum, who is RIDDICULOUSLY oveerprotective and controlling, stopped letting Scott (the brother) leave the house if she knew he was seeing me. She was rude about me, and on friday night said to Harry that she wouldnt be letting Scott and me's relationship work.   But despite that me and Scott really liekd eahcother and stuff was woprking out rly well ect, and I kept mine and his relationship totally seperate from mine and Harrys and it didnt effect Harry AT ALL, 110%  was nothign to do with him or how i acted with him or the time i spent with him.   Then last night Harry called me because he'd had an arguement with Scott and told me I was inconsiderate, and that he was mad at mw foor dating Scott, and told me to dump Scott or he'd be miserable. He basically told me to chose, and I did. I called Scott and said I didnt think it was working out, i didnt mention Harry.   The reason I broke up with him was because Harry is my all time best frined and I dotn want him to be miserable, but now I'm miserable?   I think I should have told him when i askedfirst time that that was the end of his imput andf after that he couldnt get involved, but i didnt and now im in a bit of a mess, becuase i really like scott :/   and hary hasnt even called me since, and seems to think he is the matyr in the situation and everyone is hurting him. In his words "he doesnt like things that are his belongign to anyoen else".   What do you think I should do?      also, im 15, harry is 15 and scott is 17.

20090131132410AA63Vyr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	To tell her or not? What would you do?	This guy I was dating turned out to be the scum of all scum. He had a very emotional and physical affair with me. We went away together, went out with his friends, went on many dates, etc...I found out after it went on for about two months that he has a live-in gf of 7 years. From what I've heard she is a very beautiful, sweet, successful woman. Once I found out he tried to tell me "it's complacent," "you don't understand how hard it is to just leave," etc...I didn't buy his BS and we are no longer involved.     Many of my friends have told me that I should tell his girlfriend.  However, I don't think I should.  I agree that his girlfriend should know but it's not really my place to tell her, is it? I don't know her and I don't want to be the cause (whether directly or indirectly) of breaking her heart. It's a double-edged sword - she's damned if I do, damned if I don't.     My final conclusion is to keep my mouth shut because I don't think I have the right to upheave someone else's life. I certainly hope she finds out before they get married but it's not going to come from my mouth.    Even though I don't plan on saying anything I'm curious what everyone else out there would do?

20090131132710AAE8ZIR	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Difference in politicall opinions with gf hurting relationship?	I live in a country that boasts a strong economy achieved at the expense of poiltical docility, suppression of the opposition and the ruling party's blind worship of the economic growth model with little consideration for the citizens whom don't generally go hungry, but they don't live too comfortably either, many depending on the government's occassional handout nearer to election week. I hate my country. I feel trapped, and surrounded by injustice in the rich-poor gap, in the hypocrisy of our unfeeling leaders, and the elitist culture that gives few opportunities to the poor.  Foreigners settle down in my country freely, and they are given equal priority in job search. The poor in my country cannot compete with the poor who have migrated here seeking even lower wages. Corporate taxes are lowered year and year, with the tax burden shifting to the poor as VAT increases year on year on all basic necessities. My countrymen, those with the means, have been leaving the country in throngs. (We have the 2nd highest migration rate next to afghanistan!) It is also my aspiration to one day, leave this country for a better place. But my gf, having lived an easy life in my country all her life, (she's comfortably rich) chides me for being unappreciative of the country's opportunities, (usually given to the rich), and is strongly against migrating. She has never suffered, nor have seen the suffering of her own countrymen, being born with a silver spoon in her mouth. She rests on the belief that her present comfort will be everlasting and sees no problem in compromising compromising freedom and social equality. I was born poor and cannot accept her appalling lack of maturity, and her inability to perceive the transient nature of her present comfort. We are happy together, but i feel incredibly stifled and oppressed in my own country, and i'm not sure if i'm prepared to sacrifice the higher values of freedom and justice to stay in this country with her. We quarrel each time i bring up the topic of setting up a home elsewhere, and i'm tired of slogging my guts out only to earn an income that can barely provide a roof over my head. (and i'm a graduate, but pardon my english)        Should i continue in this relationship?

We're good friends too, but a few days ago she didn't walk with me, and she always wants to talk to me, and just walked straight ahead, and I Said thanks for ditching me behind her, and she said your welcome, which was kind of cold but she's never done that. She switched her seat to sit next to me. Does signs include her looking at you when you're not? What are some other ones? She doesn't really touch me a lot or my hair or something like that. We always talk online every time. She notices when I'm sad and says  "Why are you sad?" I just want a list of common signs

20090131135637AAYUBc5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	One day a guy friend says I love you, but actions show otherwise?	I have this guy friend I have known for several months and people come up to me and ask if were a couple, but its just were close as friends.      I told him I liked him and he said he just like me as a good friend. This was in our early friendship.      But lately his actions show different. He's more flirtatious and sensitive to what I say. He's more touchy meaning always trying to hug me and seems to make silly actions to hold my hands.      Recently we always hanged out with a group of friends. But one day it was just me and him. He said he missed it when it was the two of us sometimes.      One day, He said I love you. But I dont know if this was randomly or if he was being honest.      Hes the type of guy who is flirtatious and a magnet to a lot of girls.      The difference with me is that Im closer to him and he trusts me.      But even though it may seem obvious, I dont know if he is developing feelings for me.      Advice/experiences please? Thank you.

My grades were the most important to me. I hold a 4.3 GPA. But now, I am trying to grow socially. I had a best friend in seventh and eighth grade. I can not get back with them and I am not interested in doing so. My current "group" of friends are seniors in high school and are all Asians. I feel like I rather make friends in my grade. I really want a best friend. I am a boy, a junior. Problem is, I don't really know how to make these best friends. I have also been trying to get more popular with the girls. I would say that I have a bit of a sense of humor. I make people laugh sometimes. But I never know how to carry on a conversation on texting or anything like that. I do not know how to start "talking" to girls to find their interests. I really want to pursue the girls, but I don't know how. Please help me with my social awkwardness and girl awkwardness. What is your best advice? I havn't had a girl friend since the sixth grade and that wasn't really anything.

I really like her, but I worry she won't let herself care for me. is this normal?
20090131140102AAYunVA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Relationship in trouble.?	i have been dating my boyfriend for about 4 years, since high school and we are in college now. i recently found out that he joined a fraternity and did not tell me. I dont approve of this because it's not a recognized, respected frat. it's motto is "DAB- drink another beer, do another bit*h". so not only did he lie to me for MONTHS about this, but the other day I saw a text message in his phone from one of his buddies that said "find a girl for us to run train on. i want to run train with you". (meaning 2 or more guys have sex with a girl right after each other.) i am so freaked out, mad and upset. what would you do?

20090131140612AAs5yL5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I be a Support to Boyfriend?	My boyfriend of 3 years has recently experienced some personal and family issues that has been very stressful for him. He is mentally exhausted. I have never seen him like this before. He is usually very laid back and calm. He didnt out right tell me what was wrong. I had to call him so many times because he would not pick up. Finally we talked for an hour and he told me what was going on. I felt horrible because I am so helpless to him. Today he texted me to tell me that if its okay with me, he wants some time to figure things out on his end. I said yes thats fine and he thanked me for understanding. Did i do the right thing? It was soo hard for me to do because I want to talk to him and see him but I feel he needs his space and if i interfere, he will just get irritated with me. Part of me knows that and another part of me thinks that I should be included i his life when its tough for him. He should be able to communicate with me at times like this, right? Am I doing the right thing by giving him time? Should I feel neglected? What more can I do?

20090131141500AAOaXUD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he playing with me? ?	I am 25 and I have a big crush on a guy A. About 3 months ago i thought he was not serious and started a relationship with someone else, lets call him B,  after sometime A confronted me saying i misunderstood his behaviour as lack of interest in me and.  he knew i was into him,  that he was sure he could make more happy , we should be together and that it was not right of me to be with someone else if i still had feelings for him.  And what he was saying was true, but my decisions was based on incomplete information. At the time B had moved from another city to be with me, but living separate, I care for him, and feel love for and we have a good relationship that can develop into something beautiful. After that conversation i was thinking too much about A, and asked B to go back because i needed time.  Since i have done i tried to talk to A, have not told him what happened with B, A says he miss me when we are online that i am amazing, etc...   and i have tried to talk to him,  but now i have the feeling he is playing with me. he does not call me on the phone.  He flirts a lot online, then pulls back. Its not like B is my plan B, but i really like A , i did from the beginning,  B knew that and was my friend. Now i don′t know how to interpret his lightness, and i don′t want to come on too strong, i don′t chase boys, or be dramatic by telling him how i feel    . So i do the same as him, i am hot, then cold with him.  Now i started acting like him, like i am not serious about him...  which sends the message i am playing too and being flirtatious while in a relationship with another man.   How can i know if he is playing me, one of the reasons i had a crush on him is because i felt like i could trust him, like he was a good man, and so smart. Now i don′t know what to do.   But my feelings for him are genuine.        Should i talk to him? or wait... i think things will get worse if at least i don′t try to get a straigth answer and know where i stand.       Please any advice would help

We talk alot, and we have alot in common.      He smiles at me sometimes like during basketball games when varsity is playing.   He always says bye to me after school too when i walk by.   When I noticed that he sits by me in homeroom (we get to pick where we sit), i tried sitting in different places around the room.   & he always sat across from me.      Do you think he likes me?   Or are we just buddies?      P.S.   Be honest.   I'm not like head over heels for him.   Just a crush.   The truth will not hurt whatsoever, but will be appriciated.      thank you!   [:

20060612205710AAA7gCV	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Am I doing the right thing?	Me and my boyfriend of 4 years broke up a while ago but stayed in touch. Lately he's been talking about getting back together. It was great when we were together and we were totally in love, but didn't always get along, and had lots of "on and off" periods which I think weekened the relationship. The final break up was really painfull..  But he says that he really wants to try and make it work, and that it will be different this time. I admit that I'm tempted, but I can't help but think that we broke up for a reason, that if it was meant to work out then it should've after 4 years. I just don't wanna put myself through that again if it won't last. On the other hand, we were really young when we first met, and he thinks now that we're both older and wiser and know eachother so well, we can make a fresh new start. I think I should say no and move on with my life, but deep down I'm afraid I will regret losing him one day since I still really love him...  what should I do??

20060614114644AAhshqG	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why do people invest so much energy into material goods, instead of the people and world around them?	I live in a 60-person urban housing cooperative.  We share one big kitchen, and eat dinner together every night.  Everyone does 5 hours of housework/cooking every week to keep the house running.  I've lived here for 2 years, and I'm part of this amazing community--my housemates are my support network, and they're really fun people.        [This isn't a cult at all; there's no leader, no teachings whatsoever, and people easily move in and out.]      When I go back to the suburbs, I'm amazed at my friends who live there--they seem so unhappy, understimulated, glazed over like their lives are empty.  They don't interact with many people, and every day seems to be like the previous day.  They drown their feelings with TV, alcohol, etc.       Anyway, having lived in both the suburbs and in an urban coop, I've determined that group living is better for people--remember community?  It's like being a part of a tribe, or a close family.      So why don't more people try cohousing?  I really don't know.

20060617145630AAQXMWZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls: If you were down on your luck would you turn it around?	Please take a minute to think about this situation since there are girls who have to face this decision everyday.   You are down on your luck, have too many bills and very low on cash (barely enough   just to eat). You are faced with 2 options.    1)Keep working a regular job with a low salary and allot of headache & hassle. The bills will keep pilling but you hope your luck will change.   2)Offered several thousand $ a week to be a star on a porn site. Only work a few hours a night and have the money to pay everything off plus savings. You also can quit when ever you want and can choose the guy you want to have sex with.   Which option do you choose?

20060620051033AAw2ln7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you do when the women you love hates you?	Has anyone ever fell in love with someone who treats you like crap? Maybe even abusive? My baby's mother verbally bashes me in front of all her family and friends, beats me up, use me for money, and for some reason i can't let her go. She never show any sign of liking me but yet she still hangs around. I really do love her and somehow would like to be a family but she won't let me get that close. She gets jellous if she thinks she hears other girls voices, even at work, but she constantly lets me know that she can and will sleep with anyone she wants. I don't understand this double standard. I would dump her and run if we wern't parents. This is killing me mentally, physically and, finacially help!

My friend recently sent a text message that he'll have some alone time this week (i.e. he will not communicate with some of his friends). He said he has some problems but he did not tell me what it is. I'm worried about him because is the jolly type of person, always smiling and looks happy. However, I feel guilty because the reason why I am sad might be because of the fear that I am involved in his problems (FYI: the last time he sent the exact text message involved me and another friend). I'm afraid that we won't be friends anymore.      Anyway, what should I do? I am concerned because I don't want him to be sad and partly scared that I might be one of the problems. I know I should be optimistic but I can't help thinking negatively.

20060711172551AAvuWI8	Family & Relationships;Friends	HELP ME!!!!! PLEASE!!!!! i BEG OF YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!?	HELP! Ok, my best friend Teresa (we're like sisters) and I want to go to the mall together. This weekend my mom offered to take us but her mom said she wouldn't be comfortable with it unless she went. So that never happened and my mom got pissed. Now Teresa's mom wants to take us to the mall next weekend but my mom doesn't think this is fair for her to take us and she's not allowed to do it unless her mom's there. Now my mom says the only way I can go is if her mom realizes that my mom can take us without her being there. Here's the final thing. Her mom will be fine with my mom doing it as long as she talks to her on the phone for a little bit. My mom says she shouldn't have to. Neither will budge and now me and Teresa are stuck in the middle and I'm afraid I'll never get to see my bestfriend again. Now I don't really care who you side with i just need help. What do I do?????

This guy everytime I see him in the lunchroom and I look up and our eyes happen to meet at the same time.  He just stares at me with this serious almost mad look.  This has happened probably about 9 times.  The last time he did this he was with a friend and when they walked off the friend looked back.  He had a smile on his face.  Do you think they were saying something mean about me.  Today I did a test I stood where the vending machines are you can see through the glass as they walked by.  I saw the one guy turn and look but he just glanced at didn't stare or laugh or anything.  So it wasn't like he was looking for me.  What's his deal?

My boyfriend made so much more effort with me before we were together, now he acts differently and i miss the way it was. For example he'd always stay up late to talk to me on msn, always come on msn and always speak to me, pay attention to me the most when we were out in a group, get his mates to go out where i said i'd arranged to go out. But now he never comes on msn, and i mean never, he doesn't really ask me to go out unless i ask him, and he would never dream of getting his friends to go out where i was hanging out.   Why? Why does everything have to change?
20060627080045AAW4XK2	Family & Relationships;Friends	I need a females help!!PLEASE!!?	First, some background. I am an 18 year old guy. I have never kissed a girl. My best friend is a girl. I have known her for over four years. She is really pretty. She is going to go to Germany for a year, so when I was at her house a few weeks ago for her open house (she graduated) I told her I love her. I just love her as a friend. Lately I have been thinking that I would like to give her a kiss on the cheek next time I see her, partly to see how it feels, and partly because, again, I love her(as a friend). But I don't know how she would react if I did it because we are just friends.And also, I would be too scared that she would be mad to do it. What should I do? If it makes a difference, she told me she loves me, too. And don't try to tell me that I have feelings for her, because I don't.

I care about him very much, and we really want a future together. However, he has a career that requires him to be gone for  10-15 weeks at a time. I am very unhappy with this situation, usually find myself having crazy mood swings, and sometimes I wind up casually dating other people, on the sly just becaus I am lonely. I don't know if I should just walk away, and try to find happiness elsewhere, or if it's worth trying to find a way to be okay with this if it means a marriage and a family with my very best friend and confidant (also the best lover I have ever had.)

20090225192653AALlmRw	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I've asked this question before but I still need help. My aunt's getting divorced...what can I do to help?	My favorite aunt is getting divorced from her second husband, she doesn't want to but she feels it's what is best for her kids. I honestly think it's what's best because I can't stand the guy and he does nothing for anyone in that house. But I want to know how to be supportive and what I can do to say that I'm there for her. She lives about two hours away and it's really hard for me to get to her, also she has 7 kids so it's going to be difficult for her to get to me to pick me up. I was thinking of moving in with her this summer to help her take care of things around the house and ****, she also suffers from bipolar disorder (she is on medication) and I want to make sure this doesn't cause her to relapse. But if you have any suggestions on how to make things easier for her or just anything at all let me know. Thanks

20081224071810AAnF8b3	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Que dois-je faire/penser ?	Bonjour, j'ai eu une histoire assez difficile avec un mec. Je n'ai pas pu l'appeler pendant les vacances, 2 mois sans rien. Mais comme nous ne nous étions pas "quitté" (" " !) sur de très bon terme... Et aujourd'hui, il m'ignore, il m'a appelé une fois depuis. Je l'appelle maintenant, mais j'ai l'impression qu'il s'en fou. Mais en même temps la dernière fois que je les vu (dans sa voiture, à un feu (donc de loin quoi...)) il a fait qqc qu'il faisait avant pour me plaire (il me plaisait déjà, m'enfin bon, ces hommes...).   Je ne sais pas trop quoi penser,   1) Il m'en veut et ne m'aime plus   2) Il m'en veut mais m'aime toujours au fond de lui   Je tiens énormément à cet homme, je n'arrive pas à l'oublier depuis tout ce temps, j'ai peur de le harceler je n'appelle plus...   Je l'aime quoi.   Que faire ?

He bought it with his own money, which i thought was really sweet. We now live in different countries, but he's moving here soon! I haven't seen him for a year, so would it be weird if I wore it?    Like, would he remember that he gave it to me, and feel bad? or be happy that I still have it!?       Thanks for the advice,    x

20090225161733AAspmTw	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Long but worth it help!!  I NEED ADVICE!!?	Hi I've been with my boyfriend for 6yrs. im 20 hes 23. the first 3 yrs were amazing. then things got a little rocky. We've dealt with my verb.abusive and controlling mother who would forbid us to see eachother if we had the littlest fight.once I wanted to go to the mall at a certain time and he couldnt and she called my bf and said hes mentally slow for being with me bc I was 3 yrs younger and shes going to get the cops there for rape. everyone else in my fam.loves him, he is NOT a dirtbag! however, after 3 yrs.of my mom breaking us up on and off, we became very stressed.I had no phone or online time to talk to him.my step dad typed me up a 10page rules on what I have to do if I want to be with him and made me sign it!! I began to get anxiety attacks bc i had no way of getting in touch with him. teachers would call my house because I looked so sick in school over this. my mom would tell me she doesnt care if I starve to death or if she finds me dead. I couldnt understand how my mom could act this way because to me we were just fighting like any normal couple in highschool.my dad left bc my mom got crazy.but when I was little me and my mom were really close.its sad...anyways,now my boyfriend who has stuck by me through all this and had to call my mom numerous amounts of times begging her crying to let him see me and who had to sit in his car and talk with her for an hour once or I couldnt be with him after 3 yrs.started to change towards me. He's great normally and in 6yrs has never ditched me for his boys once.and does so much for me and anything I need he does.but everytime we get into a fight or I annoy him he says really mean things and disrespects me. instead of talking to me calmly knowing im depressed with my life I could cry for hours and he still sits there and yells and says mean stuff. the other day I was getting on his nerves, I can be a bit controlling and bitchy but its because he hurts me with his words. he tells me"why r u still in my car I broke up with u, ur controlling" he doesnt actually curse at me but when i get out of his car he says"thank you god!!" I sit there and beg him to care and just hug me and be patient but he says its too much after a while.Ive gone through so much for him and cant get past it when he says mean things.my therapist wants us both to go see him, my bf said he would. is it worth it?saving this relationship? I cant take how he off and on does this when we fight.and doesnt seem to care that hes really hurting me.but when i dump him for it he cries histerical for days and calls non stop!

I love her with my entire heart, and she feels the same. I had to break up with her though, because she would get upset and play take away, and not want to talk for like sometimes an entire week. I couldn't take it any longer.      And then there was this other girl. We were friends but now things are starting to get a little serious, but I still have feelings for my ex. I don't want to hurt anyone, but I don't know what to do.       I feel like whatever I do will be bad. If I get with this girl then I'll know that it wasn't the right thing, because I still have feelings for my ex, but if I get back with my ex, then I'll feel bad because what if I hurt this other girl?      I'm feeling like crap, and like I'm a man-whore or something, because I'm caught up in this. I don't want to be like that. I just want them to be happy, and I feel like I've screwed everything up.      Well there's my soap opera. Make fun of me if you want. Call me names if you want. Do whatever, but please, someone, anyone who's reading this, help me. Thank you...
20090129050150AAqHj6q	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would women consider dating me?	My most recent relationship ended last year. I feel I'm over it now and ready to move on. The problem is that I lost my job last year due to economic downturn and I'm still struggling to get a new one. I barely get enough to survive from social welfare but set aside a little something for the internet café to check emails and search for jobs online. Anyway, I would love to have a new girlfriend but I couldn't even afford to take her to the cinema on a date. I know from previous experience that some women would find me attractive. But would they want a relationship with, or even date, someone who's unemployed like me? Also, if it was possible, how do I meet single women with my current situation holding me back?

Then yesterday after school I saw her holding another guys hand and she kissed him. For the two seconds I looked at them I felt like my heart was ripped out and thrown against a wall then thrown onto the floor and left on the ground for people to step on. I left and while I walked home I started crying, the first girl I had ever cried for. Today I was depressed and she doesn't know I know about her and the other guy, so she acted like she always did, like a girlfriend. I feel like I got played, I'm so sad and angry at the same time.

20060913155232AA6GJrS	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why would my hubby keep writing to a woman and then two days decide not write to her??	My hub and I have this common girlfriend who is also married. Anyway even though I may go weeks and not talk to the girl or write to her, she keeps in touch with me hub through weekly emails sometimes more than once a week. The reason is not cause my hub tells me but because I can access his email. anyway so the woman writes him everything from her family problems, her health, her work, her feelings and she asks my hub and then my hub replies back to her alot also. Sometimes he replies to her the same day or next day, other times he may reply to her after 5 days, but he has a good habit of replying back to the last 2 of her emails. I think sometimes she asks me if he is mad at her and I ignore the woman and then my hub writes her when he gets time, but he always replies to her. Then the last Wednesday she wrote my hub email in myspace saying that her mom is better from the stroke and cancer she had and she has started talking a little and smiling a bit. Well right away my hub e-mailed

20081107203901AAAtclD	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	No quiero ser infiel?	Hola.. Pueden hacerme críticas de las que sean, se que lo merezco.   Tengo novia y la amo, pero debo admitir que su cuerpo no me atrae al 100%. El problema es que cada que voy en el metro (vivo en el D.F.) me encanta dar "arrimones" a las chavas.. Aveces pierdo demasiado tiempo, casi una hora en irme de vagón en vagón haber cual me gusta mas su trasero, incluso, y me siento de la mierd* por cierto, llego tarde cuando la voy a visitar por culpa de esto.. Siempre digo que lo quiero controlar, pero me resulta casi imposible. Apenas el dia de ayer, con hoy, ya llevo dos dias consecutivos que logro vencer la tentación. Estoy realmente harto de mí mismo por no poder controlar esto, pues si por accidente, como paso hoy, alguna chava llega a quedar delante de mí, me excito. No lo provoqué, la chava entró y quedó en frente de mí, incluso iva en el vagon de los hombres con tal de evitarlo, pero pasó, pues ella iva con su novio. Se que si sigo esforzandome, lo lograre controlar, pero no quiero que esto me llegue a afectar el dia en que tenga mi matrimonio, ya sea con mi actual novia o con alguna otra chica, y que se vuelva mas fuerte. Lo podría controlar, pero tambien creo que necesito ayuda profesional para esto, por favor, me siento harto, culpable, me siento mierd.. haciéndolo, se que es un delito, se que no lo pueden llamar amor, pero es como cuando dices "voy a estudiar" y por mas que lo intentas, terminas distrayendote, solo que esto es mas grave. Algún centro de ayuda para esto? por favor. Estoy harto! espero alguien me entienda.

20081109191230AAcowhM	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Last fall I found that my husband was on ADULT FRIEND FINDER. Would ne1 considern this cheating?	It wouldn't have bothered me sooo much but he stated in his profile that he only wanted 1 nighters with no strings and no questions!! He had it posted for at least 6mo!!! WHAT DO U ALL THINK?????
20081109192131AAOe2Xv	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How should I handle this? My husband of 6 years has created a profile on myspace without telling me. ?	In the past I've talked to him about this and expressed my feelings about this and I thought it was a done deal that we were not going to do this. When we got married I asked him when we bought our own computer that we should get rid of our old emails and start fresh. No secrets. He reluctantly agreed. Now, we have our separate emails for work I'd like to add. But lately I've noticed his emails have been coming in fewer and fewer. No concern. I never read any anyways. Until by accident swear!- I accidentally clicked on one, that he had already read and in my haste to leave I scrolled down and noticed a few so-and-so has accepted you as their friend. So,I asked him about it. Sure enough he started a profile with our family pic and a couple of the kids(we have 2). But the responding email is his work address-not ours at home. He also had a lot of female "friends" talking with him. Now, I honestly can say he is not cheating on me but it pisses me off that he didn't say anything to me and that he has his work email address for responses. I am an old fashioned girl and like simple things. We just bought a computer about 1 year ago as I was very scared of what could happen. (Previous computer relationship issues and not married.) So, I told him I was very upset about him doing this and we hav'nt talked in a few hours. Meanwhile I went on his profile-he had told me the password and for me to check it out. I could only remove our family pic and my kids for those were the only personal things to me. Plus, I put in a little statement from him, which he will not like to much. Do I have a leg to stand on here? He knew how I felt about this and he did it anyways- 6 months later. 
20081111115156AADsWij	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this a good/bad reason to not want to break up with my boyfriend..?	I wonder a lot whether we would both just be happier without each other. I have talked to him about it a lot. He asks me if I want to break up.. I say no but the reason why is because I'm afraid that I will not find someone better, and because I'm afraid I will regret doing it and I will want him back and he will already have someone else. And he's not the type who breaks up with someone for someone else so far as I know. We've been together for 9 months. I'm really looking forward to one year.. But is that a good reason to not break up with him?

20090205064947AAz2cMi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need advice... going through a tough break up.. please be kind!?	Hey everyone.   Im 24 , and my boyfriend of a year and a half broke up with me this week... and Im absolutly devestated! (Thankgod Im between jobs and dont start my next one until next week because i cant get myself out of bed!!:(   Anyway.. He told me 2 weeks ago that he needed some space.. because we had been arguing as of late... we were starting to get a bit possessive of one another.. and well he was just unhappy with the situation which was fair enough. It had only been going on for a few weeks though. he told me he was in this 100% and that he loved me.. this was only last week.   This week... he tells me its over... I found it very hard to accept and well didnt accept it for a few days and got very angry and upset because I didnt understand why he was doing it.   We have talked since.. and he said that we both need time away from one another.. that we need to learn to be happy on our own..that he cant guarentee anything but who knows what the future will bring.. but that he needs to be on his own for now.   This has devestated me beyond belief.. I thought if you really love someone.. you stick by them through the good and bad times? thats what a relationship is right???   I love this man with all of my heart, and not put my life on hold as I need to be happy as well, but wait for him until he realises he wants this again..   Do you think its worth me waiting? I love him with all of my heart and couldnt picture my life without him. Do you think he will want to be with me again?      Thankyou !

Cela fait a peine deux heures que je ne le voit plus et sa presence me manque déjà terriblement, surtout ses regard, son air triste qu'il prend quand ca ne vas pas, ses mots gentil qu'il me murmure a l'oreille et quand il me prend dans ces bras.

20090225164225AA1gc8h	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I spend my life trying to make my wife happy...?	I have been married for almost a year and with my wife for over four years. She has had some extremely difficult things to deal with during those four years, the details of which I will spare you.       I have tried so hard to be understanding through all of them and I have put up with a whole lot from her in the form of lashing out at me and being very demanding. When these things happen (at least weekly for more than 3 years) I have always done my best to just show her love and not snap back because of what she is going through.       I am miserable.      She is never happy (she hates where we live, she hates her friends here, her job, etc.) I would be more sympathetic but she was just as happy when we lived near friends she liked in a place that she liked (I always act sympathetic and tell her I am sorry).      I am really worried that she is just incapable of being happy and that she just attaches her unhappiness to whatever is convenient.      I love her very much and all I want to do is make her happy. I never go out with friends or do anything except be with her during all of my free time. She is the most important thing in the world to me and I just want her to be happy but I cannot take this anymore.      I don't really know what I need but I just wanted to get some response.

20060713185321AAyHMmC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Wants me to break up with him?!?	ok, i need some advice as to what i should or should not do. heres the short version....i have been dating a guy for almost 14 months, the other night i get an email from him, kinda odd since we rarely communicate online, but anyways in it he says he has been thinking and that he is tired of the way i treat him, that he has done (and i quote) "nothing wrong in this relationship" and is tired of my games, so its up to me to either love him or leave him......my question is this, since he doesn't have the nerve to discuss this in person or atleast on the phone, does he even deserve a response from me, my first reaction was not to respond at all that is its over for me, then a couple days later a msg telling me that i should check my email, then another msg to see if i got the other email, still i have not responded, what do you think i should do.........? why can he not just leave it at that, why does he need a response from me? and why does he make me be the bad person and break it off?

20060718084813AAgOGon	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can I explain to my kids that I really need to go through this divorce.?	I am currently in the process of proceeding my divorce. My soon to be ex cheated me several times and enough is enough for me. When I informed him of this divorce, he was attached overseas for work, that was sometime in May. Since then, he has refused to give me the divorce.      Today, he came back home for a short break. I didnt even know he is back. I got to know when I called home and my 2 kids are not at home. He took the kids out.      When they returned later in the night with him, I locked myself in my room till he left the house to stay somewhere else.      However, my two kids behavior changed. No longer the bubbly and cheerie kids. They were gloomy. When I asked them if there is anything they want to talk about, my son started to cry. He didnt want me to go through the divorce.      Any advice how I can get them to understand that it is impossible for me to live with their father now? It hurts me to see them cry but I cant stay in this marriage any more.

We come from very different families, we have different views on religion, politics, and some of our values as well. I love my husband very much and want to stay with him. I know he loves me too, but my concern is what we will do when we have children. I am afraid our kids will be incredibly confused if both parents are on opposite sides of almost every issue. I am also afraid it will cause conflict between my husband and I about how we should raise our kids. Has anyone else been in a similar situation?

20090131084812AAJLk8p	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys: Why are you so stupid..?	.. that you always like these type of girls:   Ok so there's this new girl at school and all the guys are obsessed with her. She barely even speaks English properly coz she's from Dubai. She takes all the easy classes so she's on honor roll and the teachers and some kids think she's so smart when actually she's an idiot. She only cares about her nails and her hair and she's always looking at them in class and playing with her hair and admiring her PINK nails like she's a barbie doll or something. So what gives? Don't they realize she's stupid?    physically she's like tiny (well sortof) she's like 5'3 and she's skinny except for that she has big boobs. honestly she's kinda cute - to a guy - but i thought people grew out of that stage! She has a cute face and wavy long hair which she's OBSESSED WITH. She acts all quiet and shy and the guys think its cute even though she probably doesnt speak because she doesn't know English!! Why can't guys see beyond all that and see she's just..ughhhhhhhhhh! now they all want to ask her to prom and she's acting all innocent like no my parents wouldnt let me with this annoying face of hers. And the guys still keep trying.. wtf??   sorry i needed to vent..    but why don't guys realize she's stupid?

20090131095919AA1EfJY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to break the PERSONAL SPACE BARRIER?!?	Well there's always like a touching barrier kinda thing. I have this guy friend, but I really like him. We've only known each other for a while, but we're pretty close. I keep getting mixed signals, like a lot is just friend stuff, but then occasionally there's something that makes me think he likes me.      I'm a pretty shy person normally, though he's managing to have me not be AS shy. I still am but talking to him and everything is not a problem.. it's everything else that's harder. So anyways, there's always a personal space barrier, and I'd like to break it. A bit anyways. Like, I hope you understand what I mean. I just want him to be comfortable with me and maybe think of me as more than a friend. So anyways, I know girls are supposed to have an easier time breaking the touching barrier because, for guys it's the whole assault problem occasionally.      All I'm really looking for is some simple casual ways to break the barrier. Some subtle ways that may imply that I like him, but are also just kind not to creepy stuff. Hope that makes sense! All ideas are appreciated :)

20090131084313AA5nTAa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I just let him go?	Hi everyone, i've liked this guy on and off ever since this school year started, we were friends last year too but I never liked him that way like i do now, He's said to me that i always make him laugh & that i'm amazing and everything, and we've both done favors for eachother too, but the only thing is that he has many other friends that are girls, and he's just as friendly to them as he is with me (in a friend way), except for the fact that he gives them hugs but not me. It doesn't bother me too much anymore, but i've always wondered why he doesn't with me...anyway, he's a senior and i'm a sophomore, which is another thing because he'll be gone next year and i'll still be here, so do you think that i should try to stop liking him ? he's going to be going off to college where there will be tons of college girls, and it would be a little weird for me to like a guy in college, I'm a really smart girl and i wouldn't change myself for him or anyone, i'd love to get some different opinions, i'm really bummed lol What do you think i should do ? Thank you ! =)

He's in my sixth hour class, history, and he's trying hard to talk to me.  Of course, I am flattered by his attempts to talk to me but I just don't like him.  How do I tell him that I only like him as a friend, in a very nice way, because the guy is a sweetheart. I don't want to be playing games with him and lead him to the wrong road.  My sister thinks I should give him a chance but I don't know.      Any help, or what so ever, is highly appreciated.      Cheers,   -C?!      PS.   He has also told me that he thinks that I'm his soul mate, passionately.

I do!   3. He says it means a lot to him when I say    BYE before I leave work, but I have to walk to another   department to do so.   4. He makes sure to say when we'll work together again.   Like when I left Monday...He said see ya Friday.    5. If I'm not there, he goes to my boss to see what's wrong.   I've been sick a lot this year.   6. He says he wouldn't mind coming over to help me wash my car for free. He made everyone else pay.    7. He kinda stays away from me but watches me from a distance.   8. He says I matter more than all the other females at work.   9. I thought he had a girlfriend, but he said she's not a gf. What is "just a friend"?   10. He mentiones me to other people when I'm not anywhere around and they tell me later. Like he brags on my music to friends.   He jokingly asked me to GO TO HAWAII with him. I said I'd have to know what "this" was before I'd go ...He said You're my friend! So?

20070313174439AAGzBKO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My friends have dared me to tell the guy I have liked for over a year, that I like him?	There is a guy at my school & I have had the hugest crush on him for almost a year and a half. I started liking him in November 2005. I have never spoken to him, not even once. He doesn't know I like him and I KNOW that I am not his type AT ALL. He is in a band & I have been to his shows and he is amazing. He has gorgeous blue eyes, beautiful smile, he's funny & has a great personality. He has the skater/punk style. The reason I know he will never like me back is because I am overweight & I have heard him make fat jokes about some other girls that aren't even fat. I see through all his flaws and I still like him. I have never felt this way about a crush before. I am 18 & he is almost 17. All my other crushes in the past never even lasted more than a few months but I have liked this guy for over a year. I know Im not his type, he will never like me back & I dont have a chance with him. I have never spoken to him & now my friends are daring me to tell him that I like him.

I do not want a girlfriend but a friend. it be guy or gal.      Is this a common thing or just that I am weird?

20070213124256AAa6Og2	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What to do?	I have asked lots of questions on here. lol   Im doing alot better now. But here the past couple of weeks I have been down ( I think with it being my b-day last week and with Valentines day coming up). My "husband" wished me a happy b-day but didnt get me nothing. He still feels like he can have me whenever he wants. He calls me everyday and is nice one minute and mean the next. He will tell me he loves me and if this baby is his then he doesnt want the divorce. Then he'll call me when he is hanging out with another girl. He is just bothering me now and he knows he is hurting me. I have tried ignoring him and not answering his phone calls but then I give in after a while(he knows what to say to me). What can I do or say to him to get him to quit bothering me? Do you guys think im being too nice? Should I just try ignoring him completely, hang up on him whenever he calls(he'll call me at work, i have to answer)? Anybody been here before, any good advice?

20070131090949AAzprii	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Any wisdom please?	Okay so my ex gf recently moved 2000 miles across the country with her new bf. We had broke up about 8 months ago, after being together for a year. She loved me very much, however I needed time to figure some things out. Pretty much I dont believe I was ready for a commitiment. The thing is before she left we hung out quite a bit. We did alot of talking, and I know she still has feelings for me. I believe possibly more than her current bf. She said she wasnt moving for him(he is going to music school out there), rather she had nothing to lose. And his mom is paying her way her way out there.     IN the 3 weeks since she has been gone I have realized she may be the one for me. I have really analyzed this to make sure I am not letting my emotions cloud my judgement. But, I believe with my heart she may be the one. I am suppose to call her at work today, havent really been able to talk to her since she left. I am not quite sure what I should say on the phone. SHould I tell her how feel?

20070609053745AA4vzCA	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How come the ones you love are often the ones you can't have?	I have friends that are emotionally involved with people that have responsibilities else where. In one case, the guy marries someone else.  Letting go is hard for my friends, but holding on I believe is worst because of false hopes, improper relational treatment, and many other things.      Then, I married a woman with the intent to be married for life, but she just had her second affair after 18 years.  My love for her has faded and we are separating.  Still there is someone I would like to be interested in, but due to the nature of our relationship, that is an interest that is not an option.      The question remains, why is it that often open ourselves to people we can't have and why do those feelings seem to be so controlling?

20090131093908AAlRfLF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Immature Girlfriend, but I love her.  What can I do?	My girlfriend and I are in our early 30's.  We communicate well, share similar social/political views, and are the best friends.  But when it comes to some of the fundamental basics of an adult lifestyle I feel like she becomes an emotional/intellectual child.     She doesn't meet me halfway when it comes to basic chores and household responsibilities, such as cooking, cleaning, tidying, leaving lights on, etc.       She is a survivor, sweet kind woman, physically attractive, and totally unobtrusive.  Very easy to like.  But she's indirect, conniving, and incredibly needy.  Needy in the sense that more often than not I have to do all the interpersonal work, carrying the conversation, problem solving, and so on.     Worst off when it comes to sex, she has this elaborate fairy tale ideal that it's always some prize to be begrudgingly given at the end of a crusade.  I'm a spontaneous, creative, expressive articulate  articulate lover.  Her misconceptions about sex do nothing but frustrate and infuriate me.  Once again, she doesn't meet me half way by engaging in a mutually beneficial and enjoyable adult experience.     We both entered into this relationship with lots of problems.  I'm a deeply flawed person and her love and friendship means a lot to me.  What can I do?

How should I tell her I like her?    What should I do?

20081017092607AARWHBS	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why doesn't my friend want a hug off me? I just care about her?	I am an 18 year old boy who has only one female friend. I'm not interested in having a relationship with her or anything like that, although she can be cute sometimes, but I really want to become closer to my friend because she means the world to me (not in a sexual way though)      I view her as one of my best friends but I think she sees me as one of many friends. The thing is, due to her being my only girl friend I have nobody else to show affection to. She isn't the type of girl who goes around dishing hugs out but I've noticed that she allows her other guy friends to give her a hug or she will sit on their lap. When I try to give her a hug or put my arm around her she just moves away.      Why is she acting like this? Any tips on how to get a hug?

So a couple days ago, i told my other friend, that i liked him(as a friend) and then she told my friend that really likes him, that i love him. So a week ago i told my friend that i liked him and she was okay with it.  But now, just yesterday, she freaked out on me, and now she hates me.  Also i've been texting the guy, and he's been flirting and like saying he wants to take me to the movies and stuff like that! But my friend doesn't know that. So i don't know if i should tell her.

20090131094626AAP6mE8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Depression, Anger, Cutting etc.?	Already posted this in mental health, but im posting here too because this seems to be the most active place      Okay, Im a 15 year old male.  Sophmore in highschool.  I'm constantly down and depressed. I am happy at times, I don't know why because my life=terrible.  I have no friends. Period.  At school I have some people who when you see you say "whats up" or w/e but thats it. I dread lunch  because i sit alone everyday.  Im constantly hoping for somone too bump into me or teachers to assign us partner work just to start a conversation.  I hate the weekends because i dont have anyone to hang out with. A girlfriend is out of the question because I cant even talk to guys. Every time i see a girl i actually get angry because i know ill probably never have a gf or wife or whatever.  I HATE my family.  My mom turned into a complete ***** about 4 years ago. Before that she was really cool.  Her 21 year old bf (shes 39) is a huge ***hole wannbe "gangsta" person. -_-.  He seriously thinks he's the greatest thing that ever existed.  He even hit me more than once (including choking).  I told my mom the first time an she just said "dont make him angry". It happend after that and I called 911 and get this: She defended HIM to the police and told them i was just mad because he made me do somthing i didnt want to!  He hit her aswell last christmas eve, and went to jail for 1 whole day (whoopdi ******* do, right?) and shes was like thats it im done.  But next day, shes picking him up from jail....  I have tried cutting and it did help, but mostly to get out my anger i throw things and kick and punch stuff.  I know this isn't the healthiest way to realease, but it feels **** good.  I kicked a hole in the wall a while back and broke my foot kicking a metal chair.  Im getting really tired of it all and if this is all life has to offer then im  seriously considering suicide.  I want to just run away from it all, becuase it freaking sucks. I am constantly becoming more bitter to everything and soon i probably will just hate everything and everyone.

20090131101000AAGzcN1	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this normal for a boyfriend and girlfriend?	Alright so my girlfriend really wants to have sex with me. But her being 16 and me being an older guy we really don't get a chance to be alone together to often. We haven't had sex yet, but its obvious were crazy about each other and we are always kissing when were together.      Now shes very sexual so shes always asking me to talk dirty to her over texting haha. So I do but last night she told me to send her a picture of my penis because she really wants to see it. So I was drinking a bit and I actually did.      So now all she does is like talk about my dick, saying its such a beautiful cock and all this. And now shes even more sexual.      My question is simple is this normal for a relationship because she sounds like a porn star. We both claim were in this for more then sex but its all she talks about. We literally text all day, and she will randomly say things like I need your cock in me right now. Its pretty sweet but yea.
20090131091517AAYAsZZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Two weeks until Valentine's Day, what should be done?	I've been hanging out with one of my good guy friends, who I have an interest in, a couple of times every week... and it always seems like we always end up spending more than an hour together every time. We usually hang out one-on-one. The problem is that I get the impression that he's interested in me as well, but I'm afraid that he's either afraid to ask me to be his girlfriend or he isn't looking to date at the moment. I'm also concerned that perhaps he's just a really nice guy. I'm trying to avoid making the first step because I want him to be ready and I'd rather go by his pace, but I'm losing patience with him. I just.... what do I do?      He's a very gentlemanly kind of guy and since we're always alone together, I'm not sure if I get any special treatment or not. He holds doors for me, offers his hand when he thinks I might need it, keeps his promises... He always looks me straight in the face and eyes when we talk, but I can't always return that since it makes me kind of shy. He also tends to glance around my face and before when I was able to look in his eyes longer, I would see him occasionally glance at my lips.    When I was in a car accident a couple weeks ago with my roommate, I called him and he came right over still in his pjs and drove us. He sat with us in the ER while I got checked. He was again helpful the next day when I had to go back and then go get prescriptions filled. He looks out for me.       But how does one tell the difference between a great guy who's your friend and a guy who would ask you to be his girl? My friends have offered interesting advice, but realistically... What do I do? I'm kind of on the shy side and I'd like to avoid being like hey are you interested? We're both college students, and I haven't actually had my first boyfriend yet, so I don't really know how people move into relationships. I really care about him and would like to get closer with him. Suggestions? I'd love to be his girl before Valentine's, but I guess what happens... happens.

We have become quite close and we are now best friends. We can talk to each other about anything, anytime. Recently, as I have gotten to know her much more I think I have started to like her. She likes to tickle me and touch my hair and stuff. We always talk and hang out together. She always tells me how much she misses me and that she thinks about me a lot. We talk to each other about our dreams, and she tells me she dreams about me almost every night. However, she already has a boyfriend. I am not the kind of guy that will try to get them to break up or something, I actually talk to her about relationship problems she has with him. I am confused and I don't know what to do. I can't stop thinking about her. I always want to be near her when I'm not around her. My question is, should I tell her how I feel? And does it sound like she likes me? I'm afraid that our friendship will be ruined. Please help. Thanks in advance.

20080710061318AA1RLeH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he worth it?	I have been dating a guy for 9 mos almost. He just returned from Iraq 10 days ago. We spent the first 8 days together then now 3 days apart and he wants 3 days to think... I have been questioning him because some girls are sending msgs and saying they are his sweetheart and what not on their pages. Is it wrong for me to have asked him?  This came about because one sent a msg and I wanted to talk to him The other night he promised to call but never did I waited 5 hours and left him a voice mail (he didn't answer again) saying "I get the hint, I guess I won't talk to you later"   Was that wrong?  I agree I would have preferred to talk but took him 6 hrs to call he called me upset 1 hr after that msg.  Now he wants 3 days and says he loves me. He is moving to WA in 3 weeks for 2 years wouldn't he want to be with me?  This was our first and only fight and I hate to admit it but I feel he has cheated. Could I be wrong and he just has a lot on his mind with moving and getting back from iraq?

Okay so, my best friend and I are roommates and her ex boyfriend of two years ago, who by the way she and him took each others virginity. Well he is now talking to me and always is asking me out on dates and things.. I like him but I don't know if she still has feelings for him or if she would get mad or anything if I started dating him..She said she was never "in love" with him so I guess that means she doesnt still have feelings for him.. but I feel like even if I talk to her about it and she was fine with it it would still make things awkward between us..And since we live together that's the last thing I want.. What do you think? Should I go ahead and start dating him? Talk to her first about it? Or just completely forget about him?

20090131085810AAy73Tu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	21 year old virgin, what can I do?	I'm pissed about myself cuz I failed to get a girl back from party again last night.    I'm 21 years old and NEVER had sex in my life, technically I never had GF.   I think it's hard to find a GF, so I go to parties trying to find sex. But I just can't ask girls to go back with me. I'm to shy, or not confident enough to do that, because I don't know how the feel and how they think.   It's really hard for me to get a GF, because some girls like me but I don't have chemistry on them, some girl I like but I'm not confident to ask them out....   I'm sooo disappointed of my love life so I devoted all my energy into work and study.   I went to titty bars trying to make me not too shy when I saw the girls, but it doesn't help.    I asked myself if I'm gay, I'm not gay at all. I only love girls.   I thought about my future, and it's a unpleasure picture.   I'll work hard to make a lot of money, and find hot girls with money, maybe hookers. I might be alone all my life, only thing in my life might be work and hookers.......

20090131085906AAKYTvO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I choose between two women?	Been out of a committed relationship for over a year, had some casual dates with various people, and have reached a point where I am in the lucky or unlcky situation of having to choose between two amazing girls.      Person 1, "G", is a coworker, 7 years my junior.  We have been friends for the past two years.  After my last relationship ended, we started hanging out a bit more, seeing more of each other, but things fizzled for a number of reasons - largely because at the time I wasn't ready to be in a relationship (that whole lonely/clingy thing when the first one ends).  But - we have amazing chemistry, she keeps me on my toes, I have a blast around her, and we just feed off of each other in amazing ways.      Person 2, "L", is the "safe" one.  Very nice girl, extremely into me, know that she would be there for me for all of my needs.  Less of the excitement, and logistical (time challenges and she lives 45 mins away) challenges.      I have been interested in G honestly for the past year.  I know I would regret not pursuing things given the option.  G has been afraid to see what happens to me, which I have respected, which is why L came into the picture.  As L was starting to come into the picture, G started showing much more interest (which was to some degree a coincidence of time - she was unaware).  Now they both want me exclusively.      I feel like I do want to be in a relationship with one of them - please don't advise that I just string both along because I won't.  My challenge is that I am much more attracted to G and see a higher potential with her, but I have to give up the safety of L.  Is it worth going for the one that makes you laugh and who you have insane chemistry with?  Or is it wise to go with the safety of L (who I certainly have feelings for)?      It is also possible that G is just showing interest because she fears losing me, and how does that play into things.      I really want to cut L loose and take a big risk on G because I feel I could find another L where I couldn't find another G if things didn't work.  But it's sooooo hard to do!  Advice?

For the rest of the semester if we saw each other we either said hey or just stared at each other for bout 5 seconds kinda weird i know. I didnt really think anything of it. its been about 3 months now. About a week ago i saw her at the mall and i saw her staring at me didnt think anything of it. Yesterday at school i saw her school and we she started looking at each other again but this time she reach into her pocket and pulled out a phone. Now im not sure if that is a hint that i got a phone now or if thats a hint like hahah i played u. What should i do? should i talk to her or leave things as is.
20090131094127AA03WgP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can we still be together?	I love my ex-boyfriend very much. We're both in our early/mid twenties.   We dated about a year and a half, but the last few months were rocky to say the least.   We broke up in early December, and after a couple weeks apart, had a heated conversation about a week before Christmas. It started as an argument, and led to Christmas gifts and sex. We saw each other on Christmas, and the same thing happened. I slapped him softly, almost playfully, though - saying I didn't appreciate the things he said to hurt me the week before. He took that as a bad sign, and said we couldn't work. On Christmas.  I was bitter and angry, and on January 2nd, I slept with another man. Honestly, I told the man to slow down, and I really felt pressured into it.  When my ex and I started to see each other again later that week, I burst into tears and told him what I did. He can't look past it, despite that we'd been broken up, and it was him saying we wouldn't get back together.  I'm hanging on with hope that it will work. He loves me, and I love him. The fighting is so stupid. I just want us to be happy. Is this a useless battle? Should I give up? Or can I win him back?

Well a couple weeks ago, i met this really awesome girl, so we started talking on msn ALOT, but never in person really, cuz shes a friend of a mutual friend.    and last week i realized that i liked her ALOT (not sexual), and just as i decided that i should maybe go out with her along with several friends, just so it doesn't get awkward, she basically stops talking to me... i have no clue why, she wont go on msn, she wont answer my texts or fcbk messages, and she sounds like she wants to get rid of me when i called her.. i dont know what happened, cuz the last time we talked on msn, she was fine and she was telling me about her past, and then suddenly she stopped talking to me...    by the way, we are both 15, and i know most people will just say that 15 isnt the best time for dating, but i just want the experience....   so what do i do to get her to sttart talking to me again?

What is the perception guys have on a woman who tells a guy she likes to treat men bad?  No talking sexually.  Just meaning personality. In a nice conversation she is having with a guy and she says: I don't treat men necessarily good, sometimes I treat them bad?  Do man like to hear that or not?

20090131101005AAgK2gw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	PLEASE HELP!!! DOES THIS GIRL LIKE ME ???? (10 points for best answer)?	this is everything that has happend to this date:      im am 18 and in college (live there) and in late november, my friend john intorduced me to this girl he knew from back home. she came up once before, but i wasnt friends with them at the time, so i didnt meet her. when she came up, me, her, john, and 2 other kids partied in my room, playing pong. as the night went on, we realized how much we had in common with eachother (ny giants, ny yankkes, naples italy, avenged sevenfold-fav band, and much more) and we defenently clicked. later she took out her camera and took pics of everybody, but mostly with me. there was ALOT of pics of me and her. she stayed in johns room, (who lives on the opposite side of campus) b/c johns roomate went home, so there was an extra bed.      i invited her up 2 weeks later, and she came again. we had talked on facebook and a few times in text messages between these 2 weeks, commenting all the pictures that we took and ****. when she camee up, i wasnt sure if she liked me or not. when she arrived, me, her, and 2 others went to taco bell, and i sat down, she sat across from me, and hte whole time we llookked at eachother smiling and laughing, looking into her eyes. then we went back to my room, and played pong agian, this time, i was her partner, and we took even more pictures. the whole night we were practically "together" (the guys said it looked like there was something between us). this time, she was going to stay in this kid dave's room (becuase johns girlfriend came up, so they wanted the room to themselves). dave doesnt have a roomate, but has an extra bed. (dave lives in the building i do, and everybody else lives with john). so this time, she was to stay in my building, in daves room. halfway thru the night, she moved her bags to my suit b.c me her and dave were plannign on coming back after we were done partying in johns room. so it was like 5 am, dave left for his room, and this girl stayed with me, and we deecided to sleep. so she layed down on the couch in my common room, and i asked if she wanted to stay in my room, so she slept with me in my bed.      earlier during this day, in general convo, she mentioned something about working **** out with her ex who goes to school in DC. thats waht made me skeptical about making a move. about 2 weeks after this, she got back togehter with her ex, but it only lasted a few weeks tops (as everyone expected)   once again, we commented the pictures and talked alot on facebook, and text. she would text me, and i'd text her (so it wasnt a one way thing). a week after new years, there was a point when it didnt seem the same. i takled to her online one day, and she responded with one word answers, and then stop responding. the next day she saiid facebook wass acting slow and gay so idk.      then we chilled with a few friends and i finally saw her again (2 weeks ago) and it was alot of fun. it went fairly well, we laughed and remminsed about storeis from when she came up.      then i text her to see if she wanted to chill, but never responded, until 2 days later, she wrote on my facebook wall, saying we had to do dinner with a few friends.      so last week me, her, john, and johns gf chilled and went out to eat. (our freind nick couldnt make it) when she got to johns house, i was sitting on the love seat, and john and his gf were sitting on the couch, and there was an empty chair. she sat next to me on the love seat right away, when she could have had her own chair, then we watched a vid online, and she practilly leaned against me to watch it. later, had this knitting needle and playfully hit me with it a few times. i asked her when she wantd to come up to visit school agian, and she said either 1st or 2nd week were back, so she is going to visit soon.      also, the first time she came up, i guess one of these kids we hang with (lets call him bob) kept asking her for a kiss and freaking her out. when she met me, she text me saying things like bob sent me a textsaying do u wanna be my pong partner!? what a wierdo (cause me and her planeed on already being partners and he knew it when he asked her)      NOW a few days ago after i got out of work, she commented my face book "I LOVE YOUR NEW DEFAULT!!!!!!" b/c it was a pic of me, her , and 3 others....then i looked at her page and she changed her default to pic of me and her....      all my friends who i tell the story to say she does in there opinion, but i wonder, becuase she doesnt always respond to every facebook comment, or always talk to me if were both online   shes been talking to me so much more since the 2nd semester started back up. i text her asking her when she wanted to come up, and she said she doesnt know yet, depends on how much homework she has and when she has it, then we text for a little while. then my roomates said i need to take it easy. she has been writing on my wall a few times and she text me the other day and then again when i woke up. then today she asked me when she wanted her
20090131101015AAdpkQ7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he really just want to be friends?	I like this guy and we used to talk on the phone a lot, and we were even supposed to go out a couple times, but he canceled our plans because he had a lot of stuff to do, etc.  He told me he liked me, and would say things that would indicate that he does.  He also would always tell me how attractive he thought I was, and that he missed me when I wasn't at work.  We would also text each other a lot.  He has been rejected in the past,and is divorced, but was only married for about a year.  I asked him what he wanted from me just because I didn't know why he hadn't asked me out yet, and I wanted to know why it wasn't going anywhere.  He told me he just wants to be friends, and I don't know if I should believe that because of all the stuff he said and the way he acted, and the fact that he told me that he liked me.  We haven't really been talking since that happened, and I just don't know what to think, and I don't know what to do.  Does anyone have a similar situation or are there any guys who can explain this behavior?  Please help me.

20090131162747AAKz0cH	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Some help with my boyfriend?	We've been together for almost 2 months, but we've known each other for so much longer before hand! Well he recently decided to quit college and he asked what my opinion was on the matter and I said that he should do whatever made him happy. Well he quit and ever since his parents have been really on his back. Anyway, to cut a long story short, he's really down at the moment and has been for quite a while. He never starts conversations on msn, he rarely makes me feel appreciated and he barely talks! I don't get to see him much because I'm obviously in college and he's not. So we only get to see each other on the odd occasion. However, I understand he's down and I'm trying to help him as much as I can but he just doesn't seem to want to help himself and this just makes it so hard for me to talk to him! I say a whole paragraph of words supportive words and all he comes back with is 'blah.' I really like him and had done for a while before we were together. I don't want to end it between us! I just feel like I'm going crazy! I can't help him if he doesn't help himself and I've said all of this to him. A few moments ago I said hello to him on msn and he just didn't reply. And it's not one of those 'he didn't reply in 3 seconds' type of things, he just didn't.       Just to add - because he never really talks to me first anymore, it kind of makes me feel like I'm being annoying/clingy when I talk to him.

20090131164846AAN0gtX	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Ex wife writing to my husband!! Here it is. Ex gives up on writing to my husband how she misses him only for a?	time then starts again..writing emails how he is still hers and she wants to be spoiled by him again etc.They had a shitty marriage, my husband said it was a waste of time,nothing good came out of it except his 8 yr old daughter.By the way psycho mom gave her up so we are raising her with our 2 little ones. We've been married for 2 1/2 yrs. During this time ex wife wrote to my husband like 5 times, telling him she knows I'm good for him but she is sure whatever our relationship is like it's not enough for him, and last time husband lead her on by responding he misses her too, which is completely untrue I am sure of it. He had a nightmare with that woman, but he has a hard time hurting her as they have a good friendship and an 8 yr old. The last chat conversation really hurt me though, I felt I couldn't breath after reading it on the upstairs computer. Ex suggested him to erase it all and that she misses him, wants to be spoiled by him etc. That's when he wrote he misses her too, he has to admit... later to my questioning he said he doesn't want her to commit suicide.She gave up her daughter, she is alone and sad. Still I think it's no reason to tell her he misses her too when it's not true. We have a happy marriage. Finally because I asked him to, he wrote to her that he didn't mean what he said. And all in all, he managed to make me feel bad, being a ***** etc telling him to correct his mistake and write down he didn't mean a thing because the ex is weak and has nerve problems and not all there, you know.   My husband loves me. He cares about his ex because they have a daughter together, but I think this is going too far. All behind my back, ex asking hubby to erase and always asking if he is alone. Wanted to hang out with him with their daughter alone where she lives - a different state ..just got to know this, too. Hubby didn't go.    Anyways, I'm upset. What the hell should he do about his ex? And why am I feeling so bad?   Can you make anything out of this please?
