20090220133934AAlxtnT	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	In joint checking account with wife and third person, does the other account holder pay tax on our deposits?	My wife and I may open a joint checking account with another relative, not in our immediate family. Our banker said that they do allow accounts like this and everyone on the account may withdraw any money from the account they wish with the way we will have it set up. However, does the third person on this account have to pay any taxes for use of the deposits we make in the account? We would have paid all applicable taxes on our deposits as income already. We don't want them to have to pay any taxes on the use of the shared money in the account since we would already have paid those taxes as it would have been deposits from our income to begin with. Thank you and God Bless! I'm sure it doesn't matter, but we would live in Tennessee.

20090220135123AA7H0RA	Business & Finance;Corporations	Is there a bank that does not use batch processing?	I had a stop payment placed against a particular company, and this company tried to take money out of my checking account on the Friday before the long weekend. Due to batch processing my bank did not correct this until Tuesday - thus I had no money over the weekend and got charged NSF fees on other checks that went out on Friday (that I -did- have money to pay for if not for the payment I had stopped). The people at the bank's call center were either unable or unwilling to help me with these issues.      Is there a bank, anywhere, that does NOT use 'batch processing' (where most transactions are processed overnight) and instead makes changes in real time or at least processes batches more often than once a day? Failing that, is there a bank that would have made these changes for me sooner than Tuesday?

We owned our home before that time for several years.  We were not ready to buy after the sale of our home, but I am afraid that my credit score/finance rate will be affected, since it looks on paper that we are not "stable".  Any thoughts?  FYI, the loan application wants to know the most recent address, but if we have not lived in the most recent address for the past 2 years, then they want to know where we have lived for 3 years total.

I just turned 34 today and I am going through a bit of a mid-life crisis. I am constantly thinking of how many regrets that I have and how much goals and aspirations that I have not done.  I really have always wanted to take a trip to England. (I'm in the US). I have not taking a trip anywhere since I was a college student and that was kind of like a babysitting job. I have a job, but I am not exactly swimming in money. I am not sure if my job is secure or not. I paid off my credit cards late last year. I still have a ton of student loans though. I am single and do not have any children, so my decisions will not affect anyone else. In one sense, I feel guilty indulging in a trip because of all of the talk about the economy. But, in another sense, I feel as though I am not getting any younger and I will never accomplish anything if I don't just do it. Do you think I am being too frivolous?

20090220145926AAPY19c	Business & Finance;Credit	What will be the approximate mounthly payment for 20000$ student loan?	Right now I've borrowed about 7k so far from government and provincial student loans. I have 3 more semesters to finish my program so I am approximating that I will have about 20k debt by the time I graduate. I have a few questions actually:   1) Theoretically if I pay off ALL of my loan in 6 months after graduating, I won't have to pay any interest right? Because I believe interest doesn't build up on government student loans before you graduate.   2) How much will my mounthly payment be if I want to get rid of the debt in 2/5/10/20 years? Or how can I calculate that?   3) What happens if I don't start making payments after 6 months? Or even if I am not able to?

So I got a Visa app and filled it out with my son's info. I just fudged a little on the birth year. I used it to make a couple car payments and I actually kept up with the payments for a few months. Initially, I planned to pay it off and close the account but then I realized I couldn't afford to pay anymore. I got my finances straight but I just decided to wait out the 7 year's with my son's card. Now I got a great job--just leased a new car--so I can afford another phone for my son but I don't want debt collectors harassing him and he doesn't need to find out about the card.

Two roommates are subleasing, but the other two also have their names on the lease alone with mine. I am not sure if this constitutes a shared lease or individual leases (all I know is that I signed on the same page as my roommates but not in their presence/with them, so I'm not sure how that will hold up/what bearing it might have).    I lost my job at the end of last month and have yet to pay February rent. I found a part-time job and am still looking but not making nearly enough to pay rent.  They sent a notice about a week ago, and I have just been procrastinating (mostly because I don't know what to do).    Will late rent/threat of eviction affect my roommates or just me?   I have a place where I can stay for now, so I'm honestly now worried about being evicted, unless it hurts my roommates, who I don't want to screw over.   What are my option? What should I do?

I withdrew all of the $30K balance from a noncontributory traditional IRA and as of 12/31/08, the account is closed, $0.00 balance. I withheld Fed taxes but nothing for the state of NJ.

My husband and i filed a joint tax return and  the irs took all the return $8000 to pay my husband's back taxes for one year that that we knew about, but were unable to pay. We called them and they say he still owes for years he didn't file file, yet they have an amount for those years, inlcuding fees. We were unaware those years hadn't been filed and since we didn't file them how can they know the appropriate deductions and such to calculate a tax owed? Also, now they want to levy his wages for $6000. Can they take my money also if it is in a seperate bank account in my name only in Kansas, we live in Texas? The years he owes for we were not married yet? Also, since Texas is a community property state, why was i not entitled to 50% of the return?

20090220152536AA4ePrJ	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Law & Legal	Homicide Detective Career?	So, I searched a bit online, and did my "investigating". Haha~    I`m 15 years old, turning 16 in April~    I decided to choose becoming a Homicide Detective as a career choice because I want to solve crimes and put dangerous criminals off the streets. I frequently watch the news of my city, and am appalled at the number of murders that happens.      Anyway, I`d like to know if it is a correct job for me.      First thing, though      1. I know I must be a police officer first to become a Detective. For my city [ I reasearched on the Police forces' website ] it takes about 6 months to 3 years~ I`m fine with that. I really want to be one, and I believe being a police officer will help me in being an exceptional Detective.      2. No, despite me being a girl, I`m not squeemish. I am not sickened by the sight of victims who may have had a grotesque death. I would see what has happened to the body as a crime and tragedy, but also a large motivation to catch the criminal. I know I must work on a professional level.      So, with all that being said, yes, I have also read books written by retired Homicide Detectives, and I feel like this would be a very good job for me.....but, I`m not sure...I wanted to ask others opinions about it [ I already asked my family and friends and guidance consellour, but I also want perhaps an outside opinion. ]

What concerns would investors and creditors have based on only this information?   4. What additional finanacial and non-financial information would investors and creditors need to make investing and lending decisions for Lucent Technologies?      The info:    Executive Summary We design and deliver the systems, software and services that drive next-generation communications networks. Backed by Bell Labs research and development, we use our strengths in mobility, optical, access, data and voice networking technologies, as well as services, to create new revenue-generating opportunities for our customers, while enabling them to quickly deploy and better manage their networks. Our customer base includes communications service providers, governments and enterprises worldwide. We have three segments organized around the products and services we sell. The reportable segments are Integrated Network Solutions (“INS”), Mobility Solutions (“Mobility”) and Lucent Worldwide Services (“Services”). INS provides a broad range of software and wireline equipment related to voice networking (primarily consisting of switching products, which we sometimes refer to as convergence solutions, and voice messaging products), data and network management (primarily consisting of access and related data networking equipment and operating support software) and optical networking. Mobility provides software and wireless equipment to support radio access and core networks. Services provides deployment, maintenance, professional and managed services in support of both our product offerings as well as multi-vendor networks. Beginning in fiscal 2001, the global telecommunications market deteriorated, resulting from a decrease in the competitive local exchange carrier market and a significant reduction in capital spending by established service providers.This trend intensified during fiscal 2002 and continued into fiscal 2003. Reasons for the market deterioration included general economic slowdown, network overcapacity, customer bankruptcies, network build-out delays and limited availability of capital. We believe that the market for telecommunications equipment has stabilized and is starting to grow in certain areas. The growing demands of enterprises and consumers for additional services tailored to their needs is creating the need for a new convergence of networks, technologies and applications. Required 1. Using the Consolidated Balance Sheets for Lucent Technologies for September 30, 2004 and 2003, prepare a common-size balance sheet. 2.
