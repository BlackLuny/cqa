20090202165919AAWOZUC	Family & Relationships;Family	My mother shoplifts, help?	My mother is always shoplifting food articles and other household items from the pantry at the hospital she works at.  I am quite concerned about her, as she is obviously doing something wrong.  My mother says to me that stealing is wrong, but at the same time she does it herself.  When she contradicts herself like that, I sometimes feel that everything else that she tells me is false.  Iâ€™m afraid of talking to her about it, as we are poor, so that gives her a reason to shoplift, but my mother is very quick with her hand.  Even if I try my hardest not to upset her, she will sometimes beat me.
20090202165940AAFABaF	Family & Relationships;Family	How Do You Think I Could Rid My Life of My In-Laws?	I have now decided that I don't want my in-laws in my life.  They are jealous and manipulative and have many times tried to cause problems between my husband and I.  They do the same thing to their other child also.  They try to turn their grandson against his father so bad that the grandson gets upset and cries if they even mention his fathers name.  My mother-in-law also tries to discourage her grandson from playing with the neighborhood kids, by making him think that they don't want to play with him - I know because I've witnessed her doing this.   She has tried in the past to turn family members against one another and even my husband against me.        After 11 years of this I have decided to rid my life of these people.  Does anyone have any tips on this? Luckily my husband doesn't see them a whole lot since they live an hour away.  He calls them twice a week and spends one night with them every three months or so.  I would rather him only see them maybe twice a year to reduce his exposure to them.  Because he is very concerned about how they feel and what they think.  And sometimes be bends over backwards to please them.  I'm worried that their criticisms of me will affect how he feels about me.  So my question is how could I get my husband to limit his exposure to them?  I'm willing to try anything at this point?
20090202165945AAjAq3j	Family & Relationships;Family	Is father aloud to hit me...?	Im 15, and a few minutes ago i got in trouble for getting a C on a test and my dad got pissed off, so i started walking to my room and he grabbed my arm and slapped me across the face so hard that it turned red and now its starting to swell, and it hurts like crap. I was wondering if he could do that or if it was just another thing that parents could do to there kids, and my mom was watching the entire time, and didnt act like there was anything wrong, and thats the only reason why im asking? And is an icepack gonna help the swelling? Also is there any type of ointment or cream i could put on my arm because he bruised it when he grabbed me, but i don't think he noticed how hard he was holding?
20090202170149AA32ivW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I substituting other people in to avoid my real feeling for him?	I have this ex boyfriend that I actually think about a lot.  We don't talk anymore 'cause I think he thinks I hate him.  I started liking these other guys and I didn't even know why I liked them.  One day my friend pointed out that one of the guys I liked looked and acted a lot like my ex.  Then we realized that all of the guys do.  She says that it's just 'cause that's my "type" of guy.  But could this mean something more?  Am I substituting other people in for him?  Is it possible that I still love him but I'm in denial?  PLEASE HELP!
20090202170048AANVCf6	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why buy the cow when the milk is free?	Have you ever heard of this saying? My grandmother used to say it about women who complained that their live in boyfriend's or fiance's wouldn't take the next step and marry them.      I have to agree with her. A man isn't going to view marriage as a necessity after you've been living together for years upon years. Why should he bother to buy you a ring and get officially married if you're already practicing marriage without the legalities.      That being said, I have nothing against people who live together first. Whatever makes you happy. But what do you think about this situation?      Thanks!
20090202170127AAEe74h	Family & Relationships;Friends	He hates me so much, how can I change this?	Recently, I have started to like this guy (let's just call him Joesph) , and he likes me back. We started to talk a lot (like everyday) and Joseph's best friend (let's call him Kenny) hates my guts. I never knew why, and today, on AIM, I saw his buddy info and it said this:    I CAN'T HOLD IT IN ANYMORE HERE THEY ARE  -FEEL THREATENED BY U  -YOU ARE DOING THE SAME THING SOMEONE  DID AND IT MADE MORE THAN 1 PERSON UN HAPPY  -U ROBBED ME  -U REPLACED ME  -JUST PLAIN HATE YOUR GUTS  -YOU ARE ABLE TO RUIN MY LIFE IN 3 MINUTES    When I saw, it I instantly knew it was towards me. I was so depressed. We used to be good friends that told each other everything. Does anyone know what I should do?

20090202170426AAlUDK5	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My Wife's Ex Fiance chimed though MySpace?	Today my wife's old ex fiance found my wife's MySpace page. She was shocked to hear back from him after so many years. I laughed when I heard about it, and told her to tell him that he best becareful because his new fiance will get mad at him if she discovers him talking to my wife though emails or though his MySpace.      Same thing happened not two months ago when her first love from High School found her MySpace page. They became MySpace friends, and after some tame email messages, he disappeared. Then a week later she hears from a mutual friend that his wife discovered the conversations and flipped out.      I still have to chuckle, because all these possessive people are so scared they are going to lose their spouse if they even let them hook up for a conversation (meaning if you are going lose them, they will be gone one day-no stopping that). Oh sure, it could lead something, but I think as long as both spouses are apart of the conversation, and there is no hiding in all details, there is no cheating (in my book).
20090202170302AA2zkcJ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How would you feel if your spouse did this for your birthday?	Maybe I'm just being a baby, but on my birthday, no meals (I had to go out for my own breakfast -- I went to work that night so ate there), no cake, no song, just an unwrapped videogame from Wal-Mart (I don't even play videogames -- let alone one like this, that takes weeks to complete -- maybe I could fit something like Frogger into my schedule).      Two days later, she comes up with an ice cream cake -- no candles, no writing on it. She claims it's a birthday cake. Oh, yeah, no sex, affection or anything in there.      Would you think that a spouse like this is an incredibly selfish person? There have been 20 birthdays like this with her, unfortunately.      Or am I being a wuss?

I hate spending the night over peoples houses unless I know them 100% and I've been over there several times. I can't sleep and am tired in the morning. I don't know her parents real well either and I've never been inside her house. Also there will be lots of people I don't know.      Im gonna go to the party but I'm not sure how to say Im not spending the night. If I tell her the real reason, then she'll just say, come on it's fine or something.  If I just say im not spending the night, she will ask why.      I don't know what to say besides, make up somewhere to go in the morning. Please help!       Also I hate having to go home when every body's staying, so how can I make it where it doesn't seam like I wimped out. (which i didn't.)      No rude comments, thanx.      -Beanie :)
20090202170437AAS3jdK	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I know this is silly. I cant help but get a weird feeling just the same. I am divorced a little more than two ?	more than two years. Since then my ex and I have been in different relationships and back and forth trying to work things out every few months. He told me I had to have a job and be driving before he would consider it and wed break up and he'd be with someone new again. He is selling his store which is 30 minutes away from me. He has friends that are in their earlt 20's and he is 43. His last girl was 26 and cheated on him and then dumped him. He divorced me for her. That brings us to now. We have been texting each other little messages here and there. I sent him a message saying that I loved and missed him, very brief I guess. I sent it at 1pm. At 7 pm he tried to call me. I have call reject on. I just got a great job and I am doing well and just dont want to make the same mistake again. At the same time, I dont want to jump to conclusions and be paranoid. I just have this feeling. I dont want him to move into my place in April if he cant be trusted. He never stays over because he works 7 days a week and is up at 2 am sometimes. I see a change in the past week. Hes more distant or something. I worry its more than just selling his store. I jyst dont want to play the role of the fool again. It took me so long to stand on my own, and not need support or money or a hand to hold. Im just scared and welcome any sincere advice. Thanks in Advance.                                                                Dark

So there is this girl, and we have been friends since the begining of the school year and I've really liked her since then. We went out for a very short time, only like a week back around the end of October. Since then we have gotten to be close friends again but i still like her. All her friends and my friends know i still like her, so they keep talking to her and me about it.

Ok, so I was walking with one of my best friends today and she always tries to start trouble which is sooo annoying. She started being rude to me about me texting her brother. I only texted him once and she said I texted him more than her and then she made a really big deal about it. Then she told me that a guy I went out with for 1 year and I really liked, didn't ever like me, but I know he did. She has been a horrible friend and I know you guys are wondering why I don't just give up on her, but she has been my best friend since we were born and we are neighbors, so it would be very very awkward if we weren't friends. Now, she's texting me saying she's sorry, but this happens a lot and she really hurt my feelings. What should I do?      GET YOUR OWN SPORT!!!!!!! YOU CAN DO TRACK, SWIMMING, BASKETBALL, SOFTBALL, TENNIS, FOOTBALL, SKATEBOARDING (WHICH YOU'RE GOOD AT!!!), AND A TON OF OTHER THINGS. okay, I'm not trying to be mean but GET YOUR OWN SPORT!!!!

20090202170631AAyClmT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think he cheated?	Last night i was with my boyfriend during the game. I told him i was going home to sleep for a little and he could come over after he was done being dj at this bar he works at. He got off around 1ish and called me a couple times. finally around 2:15am i called him back and he said he was on his way to my house.        But when we were about to have sex, he kind of smelled like sex. the smell was like the lubricant from the condom smell. Does that mean he had sex before he came over? i asked him and he said no. but it just didnt seem right. so we didnt have sex. am i wrong for thinking that?

20090202170947AAbZOP3	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I take this chance? Not a marriage/divorce question but yall are more mature?	Okay so if you read back you will see I have horrible luck with men. Well anyway, I have been talking to a guy who I had a crush on in high school. Turns out he had a crush on me too and says he still does. Anyway, we have been talking through text, myspace, email, and phone. He has asked me several times to come visit him. He lives across the country from me. Im on the west coast and he is in the south. Anyway, I dont know if I should, I get so confused about the whole thing. He says the sweetest things and says that he will show me the time of my life. I knew him really well in high school and that may partly be why Im nervous and unsure. He takes awhile to text me back sometimes but I don't know why I expect him to do it sooner. We are 3 hours apart in time and I work until 8pm so thats 11pm his time. Anyway, should I go and see? He is going to pay for half of the ticket and he said I can stay with him for as long as I want. He also said after I go there I might fall in love with him. What should I do? Im not really into putting my feelings into something and not have anything good happen from it. Should I just let go and try it? Any suggestions or advice please!       PS. He has a good job and so do I just in case anyone wonders and he lives by himself

20090202171000AAIHD7F	Family & Relationships;Family	Dad/son relationship help!?	My bf lives only with his dad for most part of his life.  He calls their relationship a constant war.  His dad lost his gf when he went violent when drunk, but thank goodness his boozing has stopped. But now my bf always takes into heart of what his dad says and complains to me on the phone.  His dad gets nitpicking a lot of times, always tells or yells at him for something in his(dad) way.  Now according to my bf, it's more like verbal abuse.  His dad is not really happy during these times either, he always has something to complain about when he gets home because I guess my bf doesn't do enough to worth his share of living in the house. I always say the same things when he complains to me of all these, 'he's your dad, try to show you are capable of a lot, bring up of what you accomplished each day, don't take it into heart.'  But I think his dad is kind of selfish for a parent.    Anyone has better suggestions?
20090202171101AAkEAjU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Could he like me? Idk.?	Okay so, there is this guy that I like and I've liked him since about October I think? At times I think he likes me but I dont know hwo to tell and he has a girlfriend so yeah, thats a pretty big problem on my side but whatever I just wanna know what other peopel think.       Examples of things that make me think he might like me:      A lot of the time when we pass eachother in the hallway he'll smile and wave to me    He seems a lot more shy around me than anyone else   At lunch when we sit together sometimes he'll try to make me laugh (I gave him my tater tots once and he told me he loved me, later gave me half of his cookie after I tried to steal it, we've discussed him owning a purse)   When this guy was yelling at me in the lunch line and I wanted to get away from him, the guy I like stuck his arm out between some people and held out his hand to pull me behind him.   On Halloween we had this little party thing for the whole school in the cafeteria in the morning and I asked his bestfriend for a hug and after we had hugged I looked up and the guy I like was holding his arms otu for a hug.    He was running up the stairs with a bunch of his friends as I was running downstairs and he stopped to say hi to me.   He is around my locker a lot after lunch, but he's usually just messing around with his friends.          He is a grade above me.      Help? I just wanna get an idea of what peopel think so I can know if I should get him something for Valentines Day? Idk.

20090202171733AAvPrKo	Family & Relationships;Family	My dad molested me once when i was younger?	Ok so when i was around 5-7 years old i was molested once by my dad. And some other (different) times when i was again around that age he also called me and my older sister into the bathroom to see him naked peeing trying to make a fountain or something?. By peeing in the bathtub while taking a bath. I know this sounds dumb but idk if that would technically be called molestation would it?.   Anyways i did tell my family (My 2 uncles,my mom,grandma,and older sis) about what he did and they all seemed really upset(one of my uncles even cried about it) ,and they believed me completely right off the back and everything. But they never did anything about it like put him or me in counseling or put him in jail or kick him out the house. Also after that day when i told them what happened they never brought it up with me again except my grandma. And now that im 17 years old im really confused and kind of upset that my family didn't really do anything to my dad about this. And for awhile this didn't really bother much but now i keep reliving in my mind what he did to me. But i feel if my family doesn't do or say anything about it anymore maybe its not as big a deal as i might think it is. And i should probably just not think about it anymore. But the thing is i do really love my dad hes a good hearted guy when he wants to be. But knowing what he did to me makes me feel really awkward around him at times and idk if i shoud even forgive him and love him for what he did,wich i do. So should i just forgive and forget what my dad did to me and move on or should i still worry and not forgive him (honestly).   And also should my family have done more then they did about this honestly?   and i honestly feel that they wouldve done more about this situation but since my 2 uncles were his brothers they were probably embarassed and ashamed to tell anyone else about what he did.   (thats my opinon ^ )   And no my dad hasn't really done anything like that to me ever again. Except my grandma has told me recently he was checking out my but and also commented to her that "my breasts are getting bigger".      and the 1st time he molsted me he made me unknowingly hold his private area in the dark and made me massage it then he cumed all over me,sorry 4 going in2 detail like this but i just want to let everyone know exactly what happened.   & sorry if ive already posted this up but i want some more opinons...

20090202174351AAzUN51	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can you have a mistress for 3 years and not fall in love with her?	I caught my husband with a mistress that he kept for 3 years. She needed money and so would be paid 500rmb each time they met. He claimed that he did not love her but it was for the sex and she kept on calling him. He made her do many things that I would not do with him like sallow his *** or have her legs tied apart (all kinds of kinky sex that I did not think he was capable of). She eventually left him as she wanted more money and he did not want to pay her anymore. She was tall, slim and beautiful, 20 years younger and unmarried and listened to everything he says. He felt like a king when he was with her.     My husband claimed that he could not love her becuase she wanted money. Even though she needed money, is it possible for him to fall for her.

20090202171250AAKG9cH	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I get him to open up to me?	My husband and I have been having a lot of problems for about a year now...We can't even go a day without arguing...He told me a few weeks ago that theres alot on his mind that I don't know and when I asked him to talk to me he said no, he doesn't tell anyone...I'm big on "counseling" and have asked him to go many times because I know how bad it is to bottle things up inside. He won't go though, and he won't talk to me or anyone else. I feel like I've lost him. He isn't the same person he was before--filled with so much anger, selfish, doesn't even act like he cares about me, no motivation...I don't know how to fix it...How can I make him let me in? Am I approaching him the wrong way?? Everytime I ask him to talk to me he always says we'll talk later---and we never do. He's always hanging out with friends and never wants to spend time with me and our child. What can I do???

20090202171452AAc70zg	Family & Relationships;Family	My Mom is not sticking to what she says, it's like all she wants to do is fight.  what do I do?	My Mom has told me for a very long time that she would get me a car. My birthday came around and she and I spent days looking at used cars and test driving. She gives me price range that I can get a car at, and tells me she will not help me whatsoever with finding a car. So I do my research, and I have spent over a month doing that, getting a feel for what cars would be affordable and practical. Every car I have showed her within her price range, she finds some reason to trash it. So she lowered her price range a huge amount, and I found many cars in that decreased price for a very good deal. Again, she trashed every one. I asked her why, and she says because I'm finding too decent of cars for that price. So I ask her what kind of cars she would prefer, and to find cars that she would be willing to buy me. She told me she WOULD NOT help me at all and that it's not her place at all to help me. She wants me to call her insurance place and find out insurance on every car, and I just turned 16, I can't do EVERYTHING like that.      Now she is telling me that she will not get me a car. I asked why, and she said because of the economy. When just a few weeks ago she was all for it. I feel like she keeps coming up with excuses on why she will not let me get a car. I told her I would get a job, and pay for gas and everything. She will not talk to me when I tell her how I feel. She just interrupts and puts me down by saying personal things to make me feel bad about who I am as a person. My friend even noticed how rude my Mom is to me, and that she always puts me down when I am being respectful. My mom suffers from depression, and I'm wondering if she is bi polar at all. She is a single mom, really no friends of boyfriend, just really close sisters.      I even let it go for a while, hoping she would cool off.      I feel like I am doing EVERYTHING to be responsible and doing what she asks, I'm stuck and just don't feel like my Mom is in the right?         Please, any advice?

20090202171449AAIfLkQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend gives me self esteem but also makes me self conscious?	Hi, so before I started dating my boyfriend I hated my nose.  I didn't even want to look at it.  But, my boyfriend never cared about my nose and he actually even told me that he liked it.  That makes me feel soo much better about it.  I don't even worry about my nose as being not perfect.  I can even say I like it.   Before I met my boyfriend, I liked my chest.  It is very small but I thought it was perfect.  Now,  I hate my chest.  I wish it was larger.  My boyfriend has never said anything about them, but I think that he was dissapointed when he found out just how small they were.   So, how can I get over this self consciousness?    Thanks for taking the time to read and answer! 10 points!!

20090202171946AA9sFG9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	When can I kiss her again?	So my girl and I have been dating since mid december, we've been talking/known each other since late November. (we are both females) We are monogamous, but she is a very delicate girl so she hasn't fully committed to be my "girlfriend" because she has been hurt a lot in the past- Which I understand, that's not the problem.      anyway... we got into a huge fight about a week ago (she found a journal entry of mine i had written in anger, about her not doing enough for our relationship) and we basically argued nonstop for about 3 days. WELL, yesterday was the first time i had seen her in a week- I picked her up from work and We went for pizza (one of the things we had fought over was the fact that she doesnt eat meat, and I do... or did- I stopped a week ago, just for her, and it's going wonderfully).      we had a ton of fun, talked a lot, acted like nothing had happened between us. She came with me to pick up my 15 year old sister, and then when we went to drop her off at her car, she got out and said bye and i said "what, not even a hug?" and she jumped back in and gave me a squeeze, but that usually follows with a kiss between us. We have kissed in front of my sister before so that wasn't the problem, and I learned later that she had cramps so she probably wasn't feeling good.      I want to kiss her again, but i am afraid of the rejection. Generally i make the first move because she is more "shy" when it comes to making that move. I am HOPING that I didn't get the kiss because she didn't feel good.      Is it safe for me to try and kiss her the next time we see each other? If she is behaving like everything is back to normal, can I assume that? I would DIE if i grabbed her hand or went to kiss her and got rejected :(      Am i worrying too much over a silly situation?

20090202174226AAjCemE	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	A personal problem: if anyone can help 3......?	my family is super complicated and I won't go into all the details, but I need your help.      So here is the gist...   My biological mother ( i will refer to her as D) was 14 when she got pregnant with me and she wasn't really able to support me so my great aunt ( i will refer to her as Mom) adopted me. I can remember when I was a little girl asking questions about D and they were always answered vaguely. Though, the answers always portrayed as a girl who snuck out and fooled around with all the guys, which actually is what the stories told .   ( by the way I am 14 now soon to be 15)   Well, Mom wrote a letter one day to a college about my sister and I was reading over one of the several pages ( a page that my Mom told me not to) and I caught that D had run away one day got raped and then had me!      This news was terrifying! All this time I had imagined a girl who acted like the world was nothing and now.....      I have been carrying around this secret that I knew this but know else knows I know. I would have really liked it if my Mom would have told me. unfortunately she keeps comparing me to D. We get into fights a lot and I know who I am it has nothing to do with D. I feel like mom doesn't trust me, a long with not being able to tell me this. I think I have the right to know. I want to be able to talk to Mom about this, to be able to tell her that I do know and to find out some more information.         I just don't know how...... that's where you come in please please help think of a way a situation that I can talk to her   ______________________________________...   okay, thank you guys for replying to my question and I have some fillers that unfortunately make my situation more complicated.   I have no contact with my biological mother, D. honestly, i don't want to. She really messed up her life   ( I don't want her to do the same to mine). She is probably an alcoholic, she has three kids of her own( two to different men), and she isn't doing anything to help herself or her children.   and for fact I know that she did some "stuff", But I still need you to help me.         If you are just joining the rest of the story is beneath.   thanks, again      ______________________________________...   And I really don't want any kind of contact with D.

You're a 23 year old man who's girlfriend has just taken off to France for school for the next ten months and you'd been with her for 8 years. Then she breaks up with you on a social networking site and immediately puts up pictures of her with her new boyfriend.    Eight years... that's a long time... you love her though... unconditionally. And would take her back if she asked you.      It also happens that one of your friends told another friend of yours what happened, and she comforts you and is there for you, literally, all the time. You've known this girl for 7 years and over the past two years you've become basically best friends.   Then you sleep with her (but this is nothing new because you've slept with her a million times when you were with your ex of 8 years).      In a situation like this, would you grow feelings for this girl? Or would you use her as a rebound until your ex comes back and tries to get back together?   If you were the ex, would you still have feelings for him?   And if you were the girl he's with now.. what would you do?

Today i was watching "Secret life of the American Teenager" and he walked in on a part where Adrian was kissing her step brother. Everyone knows she is the show's whore except people who have never seen the show, which he hasn't. He started freaking out about it. I tried to tell him that the show is teaching teens all of the things that can go wrong if you do get pregnate at that age but he doesn't think it's doing anything. Then when they showed the same sex couple asking to adopt her daughter he freaked out even more! He said "God did not intend for the same sex to be together!" and he went on about that. I once again tried to explain to him that Amy most likely won't let them adopt her kid. Then he saw how Adrian and Ricky sleep together like every night and Grace still likes him but she knows that he does this. I told him she just wants to help and he was like "Yeah by making out with him? And acting like its all going to be okay that he sleeps with the other girl?" He has only seen the one episode and freaked out over it and talked my ear off pretty much the whole time! I know my morals and I am a devout Christian as well and i know whats wrong and what isn't. But is it wrong for me to like the show? How can i prove to my dad the show is not "Poisoning the minds of society"? Please help me!

20090202183453AA3xb7o	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What was her point in doing that?	So i was walking home with my friend, whom i convinced to go running with me, and on the way she called one of her friends. When we got to the fork where i go right and she goes left, she stopped at the corner and kept talking on the phone (i also stopped when she stopped). Then she hung up and called someone else. And they talked for for like 15 minutes, and all the while she was staying right around the corner. But as soon as she was done talking on the phone (we'd been standing there for like 30 minutes), she said bye and left.      So what was her whole point in doing that?

I have a brother, in l.a, who got married late last yr and is expecting his first child, who would be the person i plan to stay with. Now I want to know if someone can help me with a plan or something.
20090202184525AAR5pUB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to 'let it go' and move on ? Any Experiences would greatly help ......?	How do you 'let it go' when you love someone to the core and they never love you back. Infact, they label it as desperation which breaks your heart even more. Has it happened with any one of you ? How much time did it take ...and were you finaly able to let go and get over. I am talking about true love thats one-sided and unappreciated from the other end...
20090202190104AAfL6VB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Im in love with my bestfriend & i dont know what to do?	im a girl from PA , im in love with my bestfriend of 2 years from NY.   most of our friendship revolves around the telephone. we met off of a website "localhookupz" and started talking on the phone constantly, after a year i grew feelings for him without seeing him in person. i told him how i felt i even cried to him, but he told me he just didnt feel the same. so since he said he didnt care i did my best to just get over him. i even started talking to another guy. so i then told my bestfriend i didnt feel for him like i used to. after a few months i stopped talking to the other guy, and soon after figured out that i was STILL am in love with my bestfriend. i knew i had to see him in person, to see if it i would feel the in person. so i made plans and went to NY to see my bestfriend. we met up with each other for the 1st time and on the way r home, to PA i cried. im still in love with him and seeing him in person just made me love him more, since then i seen him on a couple occations. and i STILL feel the same. my bestfriend doesnt know that i feel like this for him again and im scared to tell him, because i dont wanna get rejected again. he says things sometimes that does make me think he cares, my other friends tell me that they know he likes me back but idk ? im so lost .. he tells me he loves me .. but idk if he means it like that ? help me SOMEONE ! : )      -Kayla.

20090202191933AA32Fg8	Family & Relationships;Family	Am I right or wrong for cursing at my dad?	I was trying to fill out FAFSA on the computer in the living room where my dad was talking to my brother and their voices were distracting me so I asked them nicley to take their conversation to another room, including the word "please." They completely ignored me and continued talking about politics and I tried to focus but just couldn't so I asked them to at least keep it down but they kept talking at the same volume completely ignoring me. So then I said, "please go to another room, I'm trying to work on FAFSA and it's very important." And they just completely ignored me so then I kind of yelled go to another room. And then my dad got angry and started giving me a lecture about the "real world" and I told him I'm just trying to fill out my application and you won't shut up and you're ignoring me. So he keeps talking over me and I'm so sick of him having no respect for me that I start yelloing and cussing at him calling him a "a narcistic, selfish bastard" and all this stuff and then he tells me I have no respect so I yell even louder telling him he was disrespecting me by ignoring me when all I'm trying to do is submit my FAFSA. Then he started cursing at me and walked out of the room. To top it all off when my brother was leaving to go to the bookstore he tells me I need to learn some respect for others. I wouldn't mind but even my mom has told me that my dad and brother are very selfish people and it's all about them all the time. If you don't suit THEIR needs, then you're selfish and disrespectful. That's how it works with them.       I know I shouldn't have yelled but I asked very nicley at least 4-5 times and he and my brother completely ignored me. Who's more wrong, me or him?      Please be nice. Thanks..

20090202140222AAlQN6j	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Would this be in bad taste?	My fiance and I having a destination wedding on the beach.  Our family and best friends are attending.  My parents are paying for the ceremony, a reception with friends when we get back, and another reception (at my mother's request) for extended family in the next state.  Only my fiance's father has agreed to help by paying for some of the rehearsal dinner.      Originally, we were going to go to a moderately priced restaurant after the ceremony on the beach.  All of a sudden, my parents have requested that we change our plans because of the cost involved.  Instead of going to the restaurant, they want to either have KFC chicken and cake at our condo OR have everyone pay for their own meal (aside from our best friends and my FH and I, which my parents would pay).      My beach wedding is southern belle elegant, with a beautiful dress, formal suits, and a violinist.  I'm not thrilled with the idea of getting married and then eating a bunch of KFC.        I understand why my parents want to cut costs, but I'm not sure if having people (i.e. my fiance's family) pay for their own meal is in bad taste.  His parents and step-parents probably could afford to help, but haven't offered to.  I'm not upset about this, but wonder if that makes it okay for them to pay for their own meal.      What do you think?  Can you think of any elegant, yet cost effective alternatives to KFC that do not require lots of prep time?      Thanks!

I work in a mental health unit for people with mild mental health issues and I have been working there for just over a year now. When I first started I was asked to help a 28 year old young man.

I then noticed that he got attached to me, and then I notice hi getting very jealous when other guys were around me, and he would also watch everything I was doing. I was moved of him as a co-worker due to his jealousy and moved of his unit and put on another unit. I do still see him around the home and when he sees me his attention is all on me, and he also still haves this jealousy issues. I took out a male client on friday and he kicked of big time all day as well. Its been six months now since I have been of his unit and he is still like jealous and watches me.

20090202163935AAfZFAr	Family & Relationships;Family	What are your family reunion traditions?	My family gets together during the summer.  We always go to the same lodge up in the mountains.  There, my mom, her eight children (4 boys, 4 girls) and their spouses, 30 grandchildren, and 6 great grandchildren all meet.        We always bring fireworks, have an overnight camp-out for the hearty adventurers, and we have one day we call "ladies day off" where the men are in charge of the meals, the cleaning, and domestic chores, and an evening of craziness.      The "ladies day off" was instituted because the women were always working and not enjoying themselves.  So my brothers decided to do our chores and entertain us at the same time.  They were acting like they could do our job better than we could.  Then found some old aprons and with their short pants it looked like they were wearing skirts.  It was turned into silliness.  The next year my sister made them proper aprons and dared them to wear them.  (Don't dare my brothers to do anything.  They are not shy.)  These were white pinafore aprons - very frilly.  They loved the aprons, and then dared each other to wear skirts underneath.  Then in the evening they performed some skits to entertain us.        When our sons were old enough they were expected to help the dads with "ladies day off".   We told them they did not have to join their dads with frilly aprons and girls clothes, but they were all eager to join the frilly apron club.  Some of the female cousins wanted to help them with their outfits and girl's clothes.  It was so popular that the next year all the teenage boys wanted to join the frilly apron club.  They prepared their girly clothes in advance.  "Ladies day off" became the main event of the reunion, with a talent and beauty contest in the evening,  (Some of these boys were really cute.)      Then we had to put the brakes on it.  It was really getting too crazy.  It was becoming the dominant feature of the reunion.  All the teens were in on it, boys and girls.  We had wigs, petticoats, and prom dresses everywhere.  Now my brothers and sisters are talking about keeping "ladies day off" but with a host of rules to keep it under control.  Perhaps just limit it to aprons. (This is not what the teens want to hear.  They think that dressing up as girls is what makes this family cool.)  We are also looking at introducing some new traditions that might be a fun substitute.

Some info:      27 years old with a college degree but an unpromising and dead end job as a bank teller for $9 an hour.      Doesn't know how to cook or clean, and relies heavily on his gf to do it for him      Likewise, relies heavily on beer/alcohol and drinks every weekend with his younger friends.  Together they act like a bunch of 20 year old college frat guys      A LOT of debt.  Not just student loans, but debt from the laptop, plasma tv and car he just HAD to have.      Relies on his 20 year old gf to buy and cook his meals.      Thinks its funny to fart on guests in our house.      Does nothing but play videogames all day, and watch tv      And the bottom line...we live together in a crummy little college house.  Yet he is 27 and this is his first home outside of living with his mom....
20090202171748AA01f7k	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How to stop the pattern of an emotionally withdrawn husband? He ignores me.?	I have been married for about 3 years now...Basically, I just don't know what to do with my marriage...should I leave him or stay?    Basically, whenever we argue he gets withdrawn. He won't talk to me for days or weeks at a time...even if I apologize. Then, once he does talk, he refuses to talk about the issue. He never apologizes first. EVER. Any argument or discussion always turns into him going to bed angry and refusing to talk. When he makes me cry in a discussion, his heart is cold. (I do not force myself to cry, he just makes me and then he acts like he doesn't care.) How do I stop this pattern? I withhold sex, but it doesn't seem to matter.      We went to one counselor, but he stopped working on what she told him to work on, so that didn't work. Any suggestions?

Regardless of the ugly break up, she is a liar, a deceiver, manipulative *****, we broke up, and it was ugly, and she kept calling me all the time, and when i told her " FF*U/C(K yourself" she kept telling me "I am" meaning that she is not having sex with anyone. In reality I knew that she probably had sex with like 10 guys since the breakup. Anyways, she came yesterday and told me that she had a misscaraige and she is like "the reason I was acting like that is because of the drugs" now I am back to normal, and I want you....

20090202180938AAAg7Xi	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do I tell my roommate that I don't want to live with her next year?	We are currently in a college dorm. We had a fight earlier in the year (I'm not ok with her smoking weed in the apartment, she is; it came up while house-hunting together), and she wouldn't talk to me for a while. During that time, I applied to apartments (pre-leasing) and continued my search for housing. I found a really great place, and it's super affordable-- even without a roommate. Now that we've reconciled (and she's started talking to me again), she thinks that living together would be a great idea. She keeps saying "we should go looking"-- but I always go, and she doesn't care, except in abstract. She is very sensitive to rejection, and I DO have to spend the next 5 months with her. How do I tell her that I don't want to live together next year without setting her off again? Being ignored is not fun, being guilt-tripped for wanting a realistically do-able housing situation is not either.     Thanks in advance for your answers!

His accident was very unexpected and has devastated our whole family. I am only 19, and I never thought I would lose my father so young because he was a really active healthy man.       I am also very worried about my grandma (my dads mom)...she is 85 years old and was staying with my dad while this whole tragedy happened. She is now back home (Europe) and all alone. She is completely devastated and I am worried she will die from sadness. My dad and grandma had such an incredible bond, and he did EVERYTHINGGG for her, and she is in shock that he has died before her.      But we cant let her live with us because we have our other grandma to deal with (she has Alzheimer's). Dealing with my other grandmas Alzheimer's has also been extremely stressful while we are trying to grieve.      Please help me get through this terrible terrible family tragedy. My dad was the greatest man to ever live and I still cant believe that he is gone.

20090202173847AAnwMoj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This eats away at me all the time. help please!?	To make a long story short, there was this guy I worked with over the summer, who I became good friends with. I heard lots of people say he liked me, but I wasn't quite sure about how I felt about him, so I ignored any romantic feelings I may have had towards him. Then the last few days of camp I realized that I really did like him, but it became too late. Now he has a girlfriend, and whenever I see him it feels like old times, but then the girlfriend comes up, and makes me feel like absolute ****. Do you think I should move on? Or wait until the summer, which by then they would most likely be broken up, because he usually doesn't have a girlfriend by the summer.      Any advice would help. Thanks.
20090202182202AAU1RBn	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	What would You do in this situation?	I need answers! Ok, so back n High School I became friends with this girl when i was a freshman. then my senior year this other girl comes in and she was kinda a bad girl and she also became friends with me. Well, this bad girl kinda brought me down a "wrong road" and I deserted my other friends for her. Well, I ended up getting into some (legal) trouble with her and we both got kicked outa my school. (It was a prep school) Wierdly though I ended up having to get my ged (considering i had come outa a prep school) n I scored really high which was cool. B/c we got kicked out, she blamed a lot on me and completely broke off the friendship. About maybe 5 months later after not speaking to each other she actually called me up and said that she still didnt want to be friends but that she was sorry for blaming me for what happened and that she holds some responsibility for what happened too. So were kinda like veery awkwardly civil to each other. Anyways, now i'm in college and low and behold she just happens to be in the same college as me! Not to mention that but she just happens to be in oe of my classes. The first class I sat towards the back and she sat in front of me towards the middle. I don't think she recognized me. Afte roll call though she didnt look behind or anything to look at me and at the end of class she didnt say hi to me.    My question is i know that I can't just ignore her through the whole semester. But I just  don't know what to do. Do you guys have any advice? Sorry this is so long.    Max Points For Any Good Answers!!!

20090202174825AAwNqbQ	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Uhm, help? It's kinda complicated but, i could use some advice (:  ?	Okaaay..=/ Soo, in lunch, I have this problem. It's a pretty weird situation. So theres these two ppl at my lunch table. 1 I have known since 7th grade, she's nice...but we'll get to her later. The other is this girl that has like major mood swings I guess, but we're not friends. This mood-swingy girl is also in my art class (and sits at my art table). She thinks that I don't talk & have no friends , and is constantly saying things like "well if u talked i'd be nicer to you", but honestly, she's like so intimidating! She's kinda, uhm, on the larger side? And can get really mean..=/ . the other girl, anyways, is very nice. But she agrees with everything this girl says b/c she doesn't want to get her mad. ANYWAYS, I HATE sitting there. Well I guess my choices are.   1. stay at the table and make real conversation with her,even though i'll prob say the wrong thing and piss her off ?   2. go to my councler and ask to get my lunch removed (we can do that & therefore im not taking lunch nxt year) (which will result in her bugging me to death about it in art class)   3. wait untill the councler calls me to the office and questions why i chose not to take lunch next year?   4. continue not talking to her and still sit at the table?      DO NOT, I REPEAT - DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT!!! suggest sitting with someone else - or by myself. thxxx :)      =/ i need seriouuuuss help.

20090202174717AAOsVTu	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	This is a question for men! confused what my man is saying?	okay so i posted a questin before this but this one is mostly for men because i no in men terms things are different then what they say.   here is my situation. me and my bf have been together for 5  years, have a daughter, well we have been fighting lately and my bf said that he is sick of the fighting and needs to be alone.   he says that he still loves me, and wants me, he just has to be alone right now. give him time.    i admit lately i havent been the best gf in the world, i have been stressed out from work and juggling a 3 year old that i wasnt giving him all my attention. he is not good at all at opening up so its hard to talk to him. i know lately i have been hinting that i would like to get married soon, and i dont know if that freaked him out??? he had a broken home and has always been scared of getting married because it might ruin the relationship.   any man out there understand this? or feel like this before?   is there anything i can do in this situation?   the hardest thing is that we are stil living together because we share an apt and we are in a lease.   so we are stil around each other, i mean do i just act normal? let him take his time? i am just so confused about this. i know i love him to death and i would do anything to make this work.    what do i do?? please any advice, i am completely lost and head over heels in love with him.

20090202182351AAJpCf8	Family & Relationships;Friends	How should i respond to them?	I'm 15 years old and its my first year in high school. Some times i get people in my classes say stupid things to me. I'm usually quiet in class, i have my ipod headphones in and i'm doing my work. After school i come home, play guitar and sing; i'm in lessons. One day this girl said to me from across the classroom: I have the same shoes as you, you're wearing girl shoes. Obviously i'm not dumb enough to buy woman shoes when i know for sure i was in the mens section and bought them in men sizes. I just looked at her and didnt respond and just put my headphones back in. How should i respond to people like this? Did i respond to her the right way? I also get alot of people who say singing is for girls and they make fun of me for going to lessons on the nights there are dances. They haven't even heard me sing either. Should i ignore them and not react or respond to them ?

20090202183202AAFQtH0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need to win a friend back..[Need a guy's opinion](girl's will work too)?	Okay so i really liked this guy for about two weeks and i started to fall really hard for him even when i was dating this one guy from another school. Me and this new guy started to go to lunch together in a car with a bunch of people and i would sit on his lap and we'd hold hands like a couple would and we'd flirt a lot too. so i felt really bad and broke up with my boyfriend. We started to go out two days after that on Halloween. It was going great for a week but a lil after a week he started acting wayy different. When we'd usually meet up in the halls to walk to class together he'd go the other way and we were near his friends he'd kinda push me out of the way so i would go hang out with my other friends.I also heard this girl was trying to steal him from me but when i asked him bout it he said i had nothing to worry bout. After two weeks of deciding whether i should break it with him i finally asked him why he was acting this way and if he wanted to break up then that's fine and we can stay friends and he said yea that'd be best. so we were friends for bout a week and then that girl that was trying to steal him told him that i was talking to her bout how he still likes me and wants me back.This is impossible because i have never laid eyes on her so there's no way i could talk to her face-to-face. when he confronted me bout it i told him i don't even know who she is and he called me a liar and told me to never talk to him and stay out of his life.. It's been about two months since all that happened and i miss him like crazy.Shouldn't he be over it by now? is there any way i can rebuild our friendship again??

20090202174149AAcqrIk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Concerned why my girlfriend was bleeding during well you know?	Ok so my girlfriend is 16 and I'm a little but older but still a teen so don't get the wrong idea here. Anyway it was only our second time doing it, but we are both experienced and yea something strange happend when I was penetrating her deep.    When I pulled out I noticed I had blood all over my thing, and she was really embarrassed but said I went so deep that I popped her cherry. But that's impossible because shes not a virgin and has had a lot of experience even though shes only 16.     She is not a whore either, she has just had a lot of drunken experience and she has been very sexual in her relationships because a guy told her he loved him just so he can get in her pants whenever he wanted.    But I'm concerned because it hurt her, and shes not on her period because she has not bleed since then. Shes actually expecting her period but it can't be, there would of been a lot more blood.    Any ideas what I did I went in as deep as it goes.

20090202175147AAZE8oV	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Why is my fiance so angry?	Im engaged to an amazing NYPD man. He is so caring and treats me wonderful plus he is so gorgeous ha. He is known to be very sarcastic and out spoken he also has a really short temper & is very hot headed aparently on the job also. Despite his apparent co*kiness he is amazing i guess cause i see the 'real' him. My 3 best friends are fond of him but my other friends don't get him at all and ask me why i am with him, i try to make them see but they refuse to. My family are the same except for my 2 brothers who are detectives with NYPD my other brothers are part of the FDNY and they hate him.(The service job goes way back in my family) I hate the tension that's going on. I am 25 years old(my fiance is 30) & this shouldn't bother me but it does. Once when he had a fight he ened up putting his fist through the wall. We dont fight that much at all but when we do i just walk away or leave the house, sometimes when i get back he has done something really romantic for me. He grew up with an abusive father and his brother is an addict he is the only one who came good from his family. Could that be a reason for him being so angry? I love him so much, i adore him.  Please help?

20090202180953AAEseTE	Family & Relationships;Friends	Friend problem, going to snap, help? >__<?	Sorry Yahoo if I seem pissy and stuff, but I really need a place to vent...I have this friend who like ALWAYS and I mean ALWAYS interigates me like whatever I say she always tries to partonize me like today I said my favorite teacher who inspired me the most is Mr.Bertoni and she was like, "Omg Helena don't even say it omg you only had him for 1 semester" and I said Ms.Baron inspired me too (her favorite teacher) and she goes ohh thats okay but we both had her for 1 semester too    -___- so she was basically contradicting herself... and then she goes on with critizing my art saying omg your art is so fluffy and goo goo gaga why arent you ever edgey... =___= *twitch*   She's been ALWAYS doing this since the beginning of the year. I confronted it to her today and then she said, "Yeah I just think your really stubborn." Stubborn? What the ****... This all started because back in November she wanted to protest for prop 8 in cali. I felt the same way that gay people should have to right for marriage but I didn't want to go protest with her because I HATE pushing my ideals on people and it really isn't my problem. She then goes on by saying, "You don't even care do you?" and it went on from there...    I feel like EVERYTHING I do or say she always tries to talk down on me or find some way to counteract what I say. I feel like I'm going to smack her, she and I were good friends since Freshmen year and now in our Senior year, she's turning into essentially a, "*****." What do I do Yahoo?    My best friend said the reason why she's like this is because I'm easy to pick on... This may be true, but I don't know what I'm doing that makes people want to pick on me... and it's making feel like I'm going to ******* cuss people out from this point on.. any advice? (Sorry for my rambling and inappropriate language)

20090202175433AA1AolW	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What can I do to revive our intimacy?	My husband and I have been  together for almost 10 years and married for nearly three years. Our sex life has always been great. But in the past two years, I've noticed some changes. From doing it 3-4 times a week, it became once a week...then it got less frequent and now we are down to once a month. This is breaking my heart because I end up feeling so disconnected from him. We don't have a baby yet and we are in our late twenties, which is why I don't understand why his desire seems to be subsiding. He prefers to watch porn DVDs over me and even caught him "going solo" while he thought I was asleep. Can you guys please help me? I'm feeling so frustrated and unloved! Could he be cheating?!

20090202180336AArVB81	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this good or bad? What does it means?	I'm honestly flattered that you would care so much about me. If you do come to the ...., I would love for you to visit me. And if I visit ...., I would love to visit you. However, you have to agree that I'm not the most charming guy. Everytime we talk, it's always about sex -- and even more unfortunate, I did get drunk and have sex with someone just last week while out for my birthday. Just sitting and thinking about it, I have no doubt you could do a lot better than me..
20090202180341AAkRCLH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This girl keeps calling me. What should I do?	I met her online the other day and (stupidly) gave her my phone number. We were going to meet up, but I have changed my mind as she keeps calling me ALL THE TIME!      The first night, she called at like 12am. She seemed all right, but after I while, I realised that it was all about her. I could hardly get a word in. Then she calls me yesterday, at like 9:30 am. I talked to her for like 20 mins, then made up an excuse that I needed to help my Dad on the computer. Then later that night, at 1am, she called again! I couldn't believe it. I was asleep, but the phone woke me up.      Then today, I went out and just got home now and the phone goes. I had a feeling it was her, so I put on a deeper voice and said that "I" was out and would be back later. She believed I was someone else and hung up.      Please help. I'm really freaked out at the moment. Do I just tell her to buzz off? I feel like Clint Eastwood in "Play Misty For Me"!

20090202180352AAM6jUM	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why is it so hard to find good friends?	i am a single guy normally with a great outlook on life, very positive and very outgoing. Im having some problems lately with people i call friends not taking my phone calls, not returning them, being left out of social events stuff like that. It seems like my outgoing, friendly, positive nature is doing me more harm than good.  People tend to make me look like a fool when it comes to being able to carry out the same responsibilities as others yet i give them no reason to do so. I really like having people around and i like discussing life and being adventurous.  Its hard getting anyone of my "friends" to really do anything let alone take my call.

My mom recently got remarried and now in my house is my mom, my stepdad, my stepbrother,16, and me,15. I hav another stepbrother,22, who is in college, but comes over on the weekends, and he givs me the creeps. For example, one second theres nothing in the doorway, and the next hes just standing there. I used to ask him if needed anything, but i stopped because he always said no. Once i even saw him standing in my doorway while i was asleep so i sat up and he walked away and i closed my door, as it was before. After that i've asked him to atleast knock if he was going to stand there but he doesn't even do that, and now its just plain creepy and its getting on my nerves. Should i talk to my mom or stepdad? And should i bring it up casually or just start off with it because i really don't want to offend anyone?

I said I didnâ€™t think she could, I mean sheâ€™s 165 cm 55 kg maximum, and looks a little like Natalie Portman and I am 185 cm and weigh 79 kg and I play basketball. My friend just laughed and said that I wouldnâ€™t stand a chance against a black belt, no matter sex or size. He says I should be scared of her. I think he may have watched too many martial arts movies.

When asking a guy if he liked me, he told me he was being cautious..   and i have sensed an overall uncertainty from him.. and my intuition is that it has sth to do with his parents disapproval of me bc we are of different ethnic backgrounds.      Anyhow.. after telling him i liked him.. he later renigged and tried to say he wasnt sure why i liked him and that girls never assume that about him...      Then after that talk, he continues to come around to hang out when in all honesty.. we arent even friends      What gives? Is he still uncertain or what?

20090202181955AAGR8Hj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	For men who have cheated, please respond?	I suspect that my boyfriend is seeing someone else, but I really have no way of finding out. I want to tell you his "symptoms" and see if that could mean he's got something on the side. I've already asked him if there's someone else, he says no. But his behavior says otherwise (or so I think)    In the past month:   1. He calls later at night than he used to   2. He's suddenly in a really good mood now when I talk to him   3. He talks about cleaning his place ALL the time    4. He goes places, like to the movies or out to dinner "by himself" and says that he's been doing that since he was old enough to drive   5. He has nothing to say to me when he calls. He just holds the phone. Or talks about what's on TV   6. He doesn't seem to mind that we haven't spent any time together in about 2 weeks.    7. Denies that there's anything different, or anything "going on"   8. Claims he's been hanging out with his boss, who is his neighbor, who he works with 8 hours a day, 5 days a week.   9. He's been very unaffectionate the past few times I've seen him   10. Last time we had sex, his usual copious load was more like a few drops    I'm sure there is more but I'm too upset to even really think right now. Guys, is this the way you acted when you cheated on your mate?

20090202182211AAEbc0l	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is this something prejudice or shameful?	A while back I overheard a man talking to someone about   why we(people) have kids. I thought it was the most    unpleasant and maybe even prejudice thing I have ever    heard. This man said "We have kids to help us(parents) out.   Kids are here(on Earth) for us. Their job is to help us out   and do things for us. That is why we have kids. This hurt that   person's feelings. I thought it was plenty shameful.      Biblically, The children's role in the family is to obey their   parents but yet something like what this man said I think is    very unbiblical.

Today I was walking home from school, (I'm 14, a freshman) and as I was walking some little 6th grader(I think) threw a big rock at my arm,for no apparent reason, bruising it. It hurt quite a bit and I was furious. So I immediately ran over to him and grabbed his shirt and threatened to punch his face in and murder his whole family. Then I just said that his parents should beat some respect into him until he bleeds. Then I let go and he ran away like a f**king coward.       But now I am kind of worried that he might tell his parents and I will get in trouble.      Was this the wrong thing to do?

I didn't know he knew so I lied.   "Well, that's not very good." He replies.      What does that mean? PLUS, my crush's friends used to be really mean but now they're like my own friends. I find my crush staring at me in class sometimes and he doesn't care that I get something wrong in class out loud and I get embarrassed. He doesn't laugh or ANYTHING. I once accidentally looked at him by turning around and he accidentally looked too and smiled at me.      What does this mean?
20090202182119AASNb9L	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is this harassment, what is going on?!?	I had been hanging out with a guy I attended high school with. He got obnoxious, clingy, made assumptions that I wanted to marry him and be with him forever and ever, etc. So I told him to scram and I don't wish to associate with him anymore, and am NOT his girlfriend. We are in our 20s and acted this childish, well actually it was just him!    We blocked each other on the online messengers we know so well. And he called me a few immature names.    Last week I texted him and said to return some property he had of mine. To put it in the mailbox, he did. He keeps calling me, about 2x a day sometimes every day or every other day. He leaves dumb voice mails such as a wrapped being grabbed to make an ugly noise in the phone, or a distance conversation of dialogue between he and someone else that is incoherent.    I have no idea why he is doing this. I thought at first he called accidentally.    1. I will not change my   again. I've changed it too many times.  2. I contacted my cell phone co and they were able to block his texts, but his calls dont seem blockable (Sprint).    What can be done? Is this harassment? Why is he doing this? He was a cool, nice, quiet guy before. He seems to have lost it!
20090202182230AAy7ZVH	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Will my so called wife's new relationship last?	Yes I have asked this question before. YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER IT! I enjoy reading all of your answers.      My wife left 1-9-09. She has moved in with a guy. Yes as a couple. She is 27 and I found out he is 37. She moved out of here and straight there. I also just found out that him and his wife separated in November. It my have something to do with my wife. Don't know that for sure. They both work at the same place. Friday night I called her. Yea to see if she would come home. She told me how happy she is and how much better f**k he is. Also I let her take the kids Thursday. She told our kids that her bf can't wait to meet them and she was getting a puppy. I will not let her take them around him. I told her to give the kids time to adjust and she said she has. BS 3 weeks!! She also told me she is going to take the kids. I have filed for custody. I don't think I can do that again. We have two kids together that are with me. We have been married 8 years.I thought everything was fine. We had a few spats. But we were doing better than ever with jobs,credit and getting along. She has done this before. Will that relationship last? Do you think she will get payback for doing this to me and my kids? No this is not any of my business. I just want my chance to turn her away like I should have done years ago. The only reason I ask is because I really tried the last two years. It looks like she came out so much better after doing this to us. They have only been living together a few weeks so I will have to see.      I will add that she has done this so many time that the kids don't even miss her. Nothing has changed and one of them said they wanted to live with me because I was a better parent. Now that came from a 9 year old!      I don't want to see it last not because I don't want her to be happy. I just want to her to see that you don't walk out on your family for someone else!

I'm asking for money from all my friends and family for my birthday. I recently ended a friendship with two people I don't like. They both INSIST on giving me money. Should I take the money or not? Also another question: Is it worth paying 280 for an Envy2?

20090202182944AAxQoVz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GUYS: how long to get over ex that hurt you?	I am dating a guy who liked me first when we met 8 years ago. I wasn't feeling it at the time. He started dating another girl for a few months but the break up was bad. Now, after all these years, we are dating, but when anyone brings up his ex, he doesn't shrug it off without some sort of emotion (usually anger). He has saved all her emails (last one being 6 months ago) but won't respond.      How long does it take to get over an ex? She was his first everything....don't know if that makes a difference,   7 hours ago - 3 days left to answer.    Additional Details   7 hours ago      he broke up with her bc of the games taht she was playing - 7 years ago.   6 hours ago      he broke up with her 7 years ago and when I brought her up, the response is usually somewhere along the lines of "I hate her, never want to talk to her, regret ever being with her..." And all I asked him was if he slept with her bc I am not comfortable bc I don't like her too much.

20090202183029AA8MGxD	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Question regarding Money and Divorce? (Hypothetical Situation)?	Let's just said that you have been working hard for 4 years and earn a total of $150,000 before you decide to marry.  However, before you marry a girl that you love, you decide to transfer $100,000 from your bank account over to your parents' account and that leave $50,000 in your bank account.      Unfortunately, 1 year later, you and your spouse decided to get a divorce since thing didn't work out so well.  I want to know what will happen to the $100,000 that I transfered from my bank account to my parents before I decided to marry cause I know that everything that I've earned since marriage will be split about 50/50? Thx for answering.

20090202183524AAZIdN3	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Need your opinion for this one.?	ok here's the situation:      I had to babysit my nephew for a week, for $50. I wanted to do it alone, but my sister kept trying to help me when i wasn't asking for help(i did most of the work). Now that the week is over and i am about to get paid, she suddenly wants to get half of it. PLUS, she just got over $100 for her birthday one day ago and already spent it in two days! Is it fair that we go half on it? Or that i get the all the money?      i'm 15 and she is 17
20090202183400AA1isLm	Family & Relationships;Friends	Somebody please help me!!! I'm about to give up!!!?	I no longer know whats wrong with me. I haven't been the same since high school, in fact, I've been worst. I'm constantly depressed and I can't seem to do the things I love anymore. I'm a music major in college (my instrument is trumpet) and I have a good part-time good (my co-workers are great!). I'm just not happy anymore. I can't sleep, my eating/appetite has become irregular and I cry just about everyday. I can't even remember the last time I was truly happy. Somebody please help me! I need somebody to help me desperately! I can't even play my instrument anymore! Please! I'm about to give up!
20090202183410AAdnoUL	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is this normal!? Other wives please..?	My husband is a great man, we've been together for 5 years and married for 1 year. Its been a rough year but we are deeply in tune to each other and deeply love each other.    However, lately it has been especially hard- he never asks me anything or makes conversation, its always about how stupid people are or ugly or fat or annoying. He is very very negative lately. He also a terrible driver- Im terrified when he's driving but I get too nervous while driving so I cant- while he can go 80mph on a narrow road in bad weather with 20ft visibility. We travel back and forth 4 hours every week and I have to CONSTANTLY tell him to slow down. He's had 2 speeding tickets plus another that he wasn't guilty of, and his whole job is about driving! I just don't want him to get a ticket in the truck and someday if we move or if he gets laid off he'll be passed by because of all the tickets. He thinks he is smarter than everyone and rules the road. He can cut people off but if he is cut off he gets all pissy. I try to straighten him out on all of these things but he just gets defensive. Example: Me: Honey, you don't need to ride these people butt, back off a little bit.    Him: Well their going slow they need to get out of my way.   Me: You don't need to be like that.    Him: *Laughs*   Me: Just slow down a little bit please?   Him: yeh yeah.... (slows down 1 mph less and then speeds up again)   He's usually not this negative towards EVERYTHING, I don't know what to do about it. I try to be ultra submissive and clean the house, provide him with what he needs, but it never seems like its enough. We get into arguments constantly and after everyone he always says he knows hes been a jerk lately and hes really really sorry he'll try not to be like that anymore but a couple hours later its the same way. We did just move to a different state for a better job, he misses his family very much- could this really effect him that bad? Anyway any thoughts would be appreciated. Thank you.

20090202183505AATd9UV	Family & Relationships;Friends	Would she like this letter?	I really like this girl at youth group and Iâ€™m almost certain that she likes me as well. We have exchanged countless e-mails just talking about everyday stuff and I think Iâ€™m about reedy to just tell her how I feel but it is going to be hard not because Iâ€™m scared but because Iâ€™m like so excited you know what I mean? She said something the other day about how she feels sorry for all the letters that have never been written, in reference to a conversation about how people hardly ever send actual letters anymore, so I thought I would handwrite a letter and send it to her telling her how I feel. Anyway this is what Iâ€™ve got so far; tell me if itâ€™s any good?       Dear -her full name-,      The subject of this letter will become quite apparent very shortly so why donâ€™t I just say it. -Her first name- (sorry I donâ€™t know your middle name, hopefully you will tell me soon) -her last name- I like you a lot and think we should get together. As you could imagine I had a huge letter typed up explaining myself and all that, but I decided that in this situation just a few words would be adequate. The following might sound cheesy but I love making analogies so weâ€™ll just have to see. There is this box containing a piece of time, time not yet used like a souring Maple tree, destine to be bound into a great novel that will last for centuryâ€™s, on this box there are two locks one of which Iâ€™m willing to unlock today, tomorrow, next week or even years from now, the question is would you like to help me open the box and capture this morsel of time that resides within, for I only have the first key and will need your help? That is if you can even see this box I speak of? Maybe you can see it just fine but are having a hard time deciding if you should open it or not. If of any question pray about it for there are many other boxes and it is only right that you should have the opportunities to open one of them as well.   If you do decide you want to hang out sometime just be yourself because I like you that way and just have fun nothing serious no pressure, Iâ€™m simply suggesting that we get to know each other a bit more outside of youth group. Final note, I know asking someone questions of this nature would be much more formal in person, but had I physically spoke to you, I would have tripped over my tongue so many times it would have been like watching a guy attempting to run with four pair of untied shoes upon his feet. Basically half of what I want to tell you wouldnâ€™t have come out so this is a great alternative. Well I wanted to keep this short and to the point so I hope I have succeeded in doing so. Whether that box ever gets opened or not remains to be seen. But either way donâ€™t let any of this talk be of distraction, for as believers in Christ we know that he will always guide us in the right direction and that we can gather together as friends praising his name and upholding his Word.       Sincerely,    -My full name-      btw some have asked, I am 18 years old

20090202190201AAYZBCs	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Explain a bit better maybe i can get better answers...porn..?	Ok I know I posted a question like this earlier but I want to clear things up. I went out for one minute one day..came back both locks on the door were locked...I pounded on the door and my husband wouldn't let me in for about 2 mins and then ran in the computer room and shut the door and told me NOT to come in. I then became suspicious that he was looking at porn, I asked him to tell me..he said no and still would not let me in the computer room. I believed him and told him sorry for thinking he was a liar (he never lied to me before) And he said "it's ok, I love you." So the next day I looked at the computer under history and I found porn! I asked him about it..he still denied it. I told him..It hurts more that I know your lying to me then looking at porn..I KNOW all guys look at it. After about an hour he confessed and told me he has a problem and looks at porn ALOT and is trying to stop. So I told him to just be HONEST with me and TELL me when he looks at it!    So I ask him and he says no...I found it agian and agian..All I asked is for him to be honest. It hurts for him to lie to me. I know pretty much all guys look at porn...but it hurts when he lies to me. We still have sex alot and I don't feel insecure about my looks or my body.       I just don't think you should LIE to your wife...I have never lied to him..And now I'm wondering what else he could lie about. I told him this and he said he just makes mistakes..but I don't feel he tries to stop them..He says "I promise" way to much..and that obviously doesn't mean anything to him. I feel like leaving him when he lies to me. I never knew this before we got married.      I just don't understand his lying...he will sometimes cry when he see's i find out and then tell me he's sorry and I think they are all fake tears because he goes and lies AGIAN.       It hurts and I don't know how long I will put up with it. I feel like lying about something to him..but I love him to much....idk what to do.

20090202190032AA1kKLo	Family & Relationships;Friends	Is it right for him to do this to my friend?	Ok, I was at my friends house the other day(we're both 13...well, I'm a few months younger) and we were both watching t.v. and talking about cute boys in our class(LOL) and her step-dad comes into the room screaming at her. And then she yelled at him back saying "Stop yelling at me!" and he picked up a pillow(it wasn't a soft pillow. It felt like a rock) and smacked her in the head with it and she hit the floor and then he kept on hitting her for like 5 minutes and told her to stop acting so spoiled. After he stopped hitting her, he threw the pillow on the ground and walked away and she was left there crying. Her face looked pretty red.      I was so scared when it was happening. What should I do? Is it normal for step parents to do that to kids?
20090202190929AAXxLoj	Family & Relationships;Friends	I really need help with this....?	okay so i'm in 8th grade and me and this girl have hated each other since the very first day of 7th grade.she stole this guy from me more than once. and every chance she gets to make me mad she will. she always throws things at me and tells me how she's so much prettier than i am and long story short she thinks she's the greatest thing alive. well today she started with me again and me and my two best friends told her thats it we wanna fight her. but the problem is it's 3 against one and i'm guessing we could get in trouble for that. all 3 of us are very tough but i have a few questions.   1. if she told the principal could we get in trouble even though we didn't do it yet?   2.if the principle warned us not to fight her but we did anyway and it wasnt on school grounds could we get in trouble?   3.could we get in trouble if it was 3 against one?   4.can we get expelled if its not on school grounds?

20090202190333AAg7mXA	Family & Relationships;Friends	What do I do now? Help?	Ok, lemmie start out by giving some background. I am a 10th grade guy, asian, and pretty quiet. I am trying out for the tennis team. I did not make it last year.      Last years varsity team seems to not like me very much because I wasn't good at tennis. When I arrive on the first day of tryouts, one guy says "Hey kid, the asian bus is that way!" and he points at the short bus.      So tryouts continue, an underclassman friend of mine is there, 8th grader. We were in orchestra together and we were kinda each others friend's friends, but we never really talked to each other that much. He is pretty, well...mediocre at tennis, but hey, hes my friend so I go easy on him at tryouts. Let's call him Justin.      I am a pretty quiet kid at school, but theres a 10th grade friend of mine who always seems to be there, funny, and always keeps my spirits high. His name is Chris. And his little brother, 7th grader, Bryce, is trying out for the tennis team too. I baby them because neither is very good at tennis, but I never notice when coach walks by and he always sees me playing extremely bad and he thinks im as bad as I used to be.       Theres a friend of mine at school, lets call him darb. He was on the varsity team last year. He is pretty nice guy, but he doesn't even talk to me at tennis because I have such a bad reputation with the varsity team and he doesn't want to be seen around me.      And worst of all, the seemingly Captain of the team always talked about me behind my back.       and at the end of practice, some people are left while everyone else's parents pick them up. The leftover kids form a huddle and have a conversation. I go to join and when they see me they all break up.   what do i do?

It's the same day as mine.  Now she's torn.  The problem is: I never intended to invite her.  It's a VERY small wedding (50 people) I even told her "well you should go to hers.  Ours is very small and really just family" and she responded "I know but I really wanted to come to yours.  I guess I have plenty of time to decide"   I never told her she was invited in the past.  Never led her to believe she would be.  I love her to death but we aren't that close anymore and only chat through facebook. Plus I really don't like her boyfriend.  Something about him just isn't right. I don't trust him at all. and then I'd have to have their kids come too. and it's just...i don't know what to tell her now.

20090202124304AA8qHvx	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My wife want to go out drinking on her birthday.Advice please?	She wants to go out drinking with her mother , and her mother is one of those people who think 1or 2 drinks and she can still drive. Last time i had to go pick her and her coworker they both swore they only had 2 drinks and the drinks might of been drugged. Honestly it was just they had way more then 2 drinks and where uber smashed. I would drive them both my self to and from but i can't naturally leave my daughter at the house alone or take her to a bar. Would it be better to hire a personal drive for that night or drive them up there drop them off then come back and pick them both back up?    Should i just trust them to be smart about it if there to intoxicated to not drive.

20090202184058AA0mBwZ	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why does my family act this way?	OK so, my aunt is basically a B**** and this is what happened. I usually go on vacation with her and this yr she was yelling on the phone to my mom that theres no room in the car for me. Which never had been the problem b4. so i ended up not going down the shore, and the rest of my fam. goes down the shore too so why couldnt sum1 else take me? no1 offered. And tell me how my cousin calls me up once a yr and i hardly see her but when i do she spends a lot of money on me cuz shes into that.     But then she says "Why dont u call me?" Cuz im a kid! Arent the olders ones supposed to call the kids? And they treat my mom like she doesnt even exist and they also talk bad about her to me sumtimes. Which none of it is true. The they pretend like nothing is wrong after everything wrong has happened? So WHY?
20090202191727AACZJ0g	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Did I do something wrong?	A few nights ago my wife had a few drinks and wanted to push the envelope a little. So, I tied her up. She was fine with it until I took her in a way that has been off-limits since we've married. I wanted it, she didn't; we both finished over-the-top. When I untied her, she didn't say a word and hasn't spoken to me in three or four days. She's sleeping on the couch. The only thing she said was tonight when, after I asked what the hell was wrong with her, she said "I'm trying to decide whether I'm going to throw your s**t in the yard or not."   Why is she so pissed off?

20090202190604AAqTO4X	Family & Relationships;Family	I felt like my father didn't love me?	When I was little I was always daddy's girl. I always ran to him and hugged him when he walked through the door getting home from work. We always went to the daddy daughter dance and I loved that.      When I got older, it always felt for me that It was harder to impress him. I wasn't that athletic before, didn't do sports. i was more into theater and singing, but that was like no big deal at all. I had a lot of competition. my brother was one of the best national ranked tie kwon do fighters (karate) My sister was one of the smartest in her class, and my little brother was one of the best baseball players on his team, and left handed.      I would always study, thinking to myself, when I get a great grade I will show  it to him. When ever I came home with an A or A+ on my test, he would say something like, "Aww thats amazing. Great job." And I always thought to myself, that must be what its like when Jake wins first place, when Max is the one that hit that homerun that won the game. When Maddi got accepted into that college.      I do softball, theater, school choir, and still get a 4.0 My mother has always showed love towards me. Even to this day I still feel like it is harder then Jake, Max, and Maddi to impress him.       Jake and Max aren't so good when it comes to grades. Do you think that If you're not good at a sport or something unschool related, you will end up with better grades, and impress people with that?       Is it pethetic that I (tried) to impress my dad with my good grades?

It's not that I'm not attractive. I'm aware that I'm probably in "the friend zone". I can't stop liking her. I've tried distancing myself from her. I've tried focusing on other girls. I just can't do it. I'm to the point where I don't know what to do with myself. How can I tell her how I feel without looking like a huge creep?

20090202184212AA1rplD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Im in love......what should I do?	Ok...so he is my middle school sweetheart. We fell n love and just last year he graduated and signed up for the army. Before he graduated, we decided to start back up our relationship. (we broke up for a while..) We both did this knowing he was going to basic training in a couple of months. So when we decided to start this relationship back up, I was talking about marriage like we used to talk about it when we were younger (we both agreed we wanted to get married then)...At first, he didn't want to marry me when I brought it up....so I gave him an ultimatium before he left..( either he marry me or I move on) so he agreed to it...I didn't say he had to marry me right away, but I said I don't want to be messing around with him for YEARS and not have a ring or his last name to show for it...so he went to basic and in the beginning of him being there he was talking about marrying me as soon as he get home. So I go find a dress start getting plans together for a nice small wedding. Towards the end of his time, he says he don't think this is the best time for us to get married. He said his sergents told him that. So yes, I got pissed because he didn't talk to me about it..instead he wrote it in a letter. So before he get home, I told my family I didn't want to get married...(yea,I lied) So he came home and we went over my sister house. She asks him why we didn't get married. He says because he's not ready for a wife, not ready for that responsibility. He never told me all that. He just gave me the lame excuse that his sergents told him that its not a good choice. So yea I cried once again. I don't know what to do...I back off the marriage subject because I feel like im harassing him even though he says im not...he wants to marry me, but not right now..I see what he means, but then again, if i can deal with being without you while your training,don't you think I could deal with being married to him without him being here? So my question out of all of the other questions is Should I stay and wait, stay and mess off on the side,  or just leave altogether? ( Don't worry, im gonna stay. Im just trying to get some opinions here. I love him to much to leave him, but I am going to stand my ground about marriage.)

20090202184727AAygJpW	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Divorce? we have a baby...so confused?	i don't know what to do. a large part of my husband i love. he can be so sweet and we can have so much fun together. he is a fabulous, engaged father to our 7 month old son. yet another part of him i absolutely despise. he can be my biggest supporter, always thinking of me, and then he can also be controlling and irrational. he freaks out over stupid things and we just see the world so differently. in a given week i'll be so happy with him, and then he acts in a way that makes me despise him. he's not abusive, but i feel when he acts in certain ways that i do not love him and don't know how i married him. when i think of divorcing him, i feel a sense of freedom, it seems so appealing, and the only thing that holds me back is what it would do to our daughter and how horrible the process would be. do i stay in a marriage when i can be very happy but there is always an underlying feeling of general discontent and "sweeping our issues under the rug" for the sake of my daughter? When there is no family or outside pressure things are great, but we can't live on our own island. so do i just focus on the good or listen to that big part of me that tells me that while i am really happy some of the time, i shouldn't feel miserable half the time, or just suck it up for my daughter? we've been to counseling...hasn't helped.

20090202190432AA8lXTv	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Should I go to therapy?	Right now I'm a 21 year old college student. My major is International Economics/Business, and I'm not really that happy with it. Yeah, I am semi-interested in it, but it's not what I want I want to do with my life. The problem is, I don't really know what I do want to do. I just don't know that I'm not doing what I want to be doing. Honestly, I don't get enjoyment out of many activities. Part of me actually wants to drop out of college, but I only have a year left, so it's not an option. I just don't know what I want to do. I feel that even if I do get a great job...so what? I'm going to be a wage-slave my whole life and then die. We're all going to die, so what's the point. But it's sort of reassuring that we're all going to die, because it leaves us more freedom to do whatever the hell we want.   Another issue is that I've never been in a relationship, which doesn't bother me so much. I also have no desire for sex. So perhaps I'm asexual. I think society puts way too much emphasis on relationships. People think that if they don't have someone they are incomplete or a loser. Why can't people just be happy alone? Why can't people be happy with themselves? I think there's more to life than relationships and love. What's with society's obsession over love. Because when it comes down to it, if you're not happy with yourself, and don't love yourself, you're not gong to be happy in a relationship. Relationships are not a cure to make yourself happy.   Between school and relationships, I'm just at a very confused point in my life. Society's typical path of good career, marriage, white picket fence, kids is not for me..   On top of everything, I have an extremely overbearing mother who won't stop telling me what jobs to apply for and what to do with my life.

20090202185420AATkqbU	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Are my feelings and words justified about the job situation? Affecting my relationship?	I've been out of a job since January 01, 2009, in California.  The first week I didn't go out and look. But since then I've put in about 100-200 applications. Somewhere in those digits. I either get that they're not hiring, have no applications (yes I go back another time and still none), That they are hiring but when I call for a follow up they're not, or when I do get an interview its an open interview. I go into get applications dressed as I would for an interview. hair done and everything. Black skirt, white top, dress shoes.    The problem lies in that I am putting in effort, even though some days that I sleep in. I get depressed but try and keep a smile for everyone. The problem is my fiance says I'm not trying hard enough.    He says he wants me as a wife, he needs to know his mate is going to get tough in tough times. That I'm going to get out there and make it    He says I should have had a job by now.    And now if I don't have a job by the end of this month I'm out on my own, moving back to my family.    I don't understand it, and I'm distraught every single night thinking about it. I don't know what to do or what to tell him or anything. I told him I'm hanging tough and I'm trying my hardest....    I just don't know any more.
20090202185511AAIxeM0	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Please give me some advise?	for some reason  i have a big issue with my husband talking to his ex... the one he left for me.... i dont nag about it.. i dont fight about it... i exploded when i first found out but he hid it from me and then tried to lie... but after all  was said and done i explained to him that bygones can be bygones.. as long as he doesnt hide things from me and if its nothin to worry about it then ok.... if she is cool i am cool.. ok..   well.. heres the deal... she is very disrespectful to me. and has a big problem with the fact that i dont like her around... as far as i know he only talks  to her on the phone.. but.. i could be mistaken....    now.. i trust him.. i really do. but my problem is that fact that he insists on talking to her even after she degrades me and disrespect me. i explained to him how this does not make me feel good AT ALL. he claimed to understand and told me he would not talk to her any more. well she still calls and he still answers the phone( he tries to hide it from me...he told me erased her number so he is unable to call her.. but its alays on the call log in his phone.. or texts from her.. thats a perfect way to keep it with out being in his contacts.) and i found out today that he called her from the house phone! i really think she does not need our home number..  we have a family to worry about i personally feel she should have nothin to do with it. period. i have already blocked her from being able to call our house but it kinda defeats the purpose when he can just call her...    i KNOW i sound like a jealous hormonal pregnant wife.. but come on..   this is really messin with my dignity here... cuz it seems that no matter what i may say to her to deter her from being in his life.. ( she tells me i can do whatever i want i am not gettin rid of her.. but yet also that she does not want him and is happy with her new man... ) he turns around and lets her in any ways...   kinda makes me look like a damn fool if u ask me...    any advise???
20090202185559AAsYF9p	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Sex in the Hospital? (Girls and Guys)?	ok so this isn't really about sex in a hospital but it was the only way to get u to click on it. I am in High School and I really like this guy (i might even love him) and he (according to his friends and his actions) really likes me too. I have this friend who just moved here a few weeks ago (lets call her Kal) and has decided that she likes the same guy i like. he (lets cal him bub) doesn't like her at all from what i can tell. but she won't stop flirting with him in front of me. I make it VERY obvious that i like him btw. i told kal that i didn't mind but i lied. and now, bub got in a snow boarding accident and is in the hospital with a broken femur. i have gone in to see him and brought him cookies. before i went, kal asked if i coud drive her to see him and i said no because it bugged me and she acts like she likes him way more than i do and i no that she doesn't.       I don't really know what i am asking here. i guess that i would just like some opinions. thanks
20090202185600AAVePqU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	These guys keep looking at me, but haven't spoken to me? Am I overreacting?	Okay, so there are a few older guys (they aren't really friends, so they probably don't talk about me) I see around in school, and we almost always make eye contact. Sometimes they will even turn their head and look at me (I'm not full of myself, believe me) from a far away distance. Yet, they haven't said anything to me.   I've noticed all of them are outgoing, but I'm really shy.   Could they actually think I'm "cute", or am I overreacting?   hahaha I have no life =PP   thanks!

20090202185805AAcLFvM	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband treats his mother badly, is it my business?	I've been married for 2 years now and were doing ok, but an issue thats scary to me is the way my husband treats his parents. they worked all the time during the last 30 years to support their kids, but never got to 'spend quality time' with them growing up and raising them.    Now my husband is blaming and fighting with his mother, accusing her of all the 'mistakes she made in the past and blaming her for all of his 'psychological' issues. he is seriously a JERK to her.      I'm scared that this is somehow a foreshadow of whats to come in the future for me.     He also treats his younger sister like crap...its makes me angry too.   Do you think he is really a jerk inside and i just don't see it because we haven't been married long enough? should i be scared?

20090202124300AAiwO1T	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Emotional friend issues?	About one month ago my oldest son caught an e-mail from my wife that was not intended for him.He approached my wife(his stepmother)and said he was going to tell me but gave her the chance to come clean to me first in which she did supposedly and I believed her.The story goes that the guy is an old boyfriend from high school and over a 3mth period of e-mails and talking on the phone she fell in love all over again.  (I'm heart broken)   Anyhow she promised me she would end it and I trusted her but the following week I found phone records showing she spent 2hrs. on the phone with him while I was in Chicago,again I confronted her she said she would end it again I trusted her.The following week same thing  and same response.   Until last week I intercepted an e-mail from her to him saying she could'nt wait to be with him and did'nt know how to tell me so again I confronted her and ask her to move out.   My Question is should I ever trust her again?   She swears its over and I am the better man for her, I love her with all my heart and am giving her one last chance.   Am I stupid or what??

20090202125517AANqGus	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I deal with a copy cat?	I recently got a step sister in my life. It just so happens that I am a couple of moths older than her (10 months to be exact.) We kind of have the same style but recently it's almost like she's becoming me. For example.....   My mom Married her Dad and we both have shared custody with our parents. Whenever I decide to be at my Mom's house she always shows up, then I get my lip pierced, and she does the same. For Christmas I asked for a Camera and now she's getting one for her birthday (which just so happens to be tomorrow). I've had my lip pierced for a while now and I have my favorite red ring to wear and she goes out and buys a similar one. And let's not forget how she's spending a lot of time with my Mom all of a sudden....      I don't know if I'm looking into it way too much but it kind of bothers me. I mean, what next? She also meantions something about my t-shirts too.       I find this really awkward because we hardly talk. Is it flattery or keep-your-enimies-closer sorta deal??
20090202130400AATvo4R	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can you make a child understand they can't change things.?	I have been with my hubby for 4 years and his kids keep bringing pictures over to show him of their mother and some times i walk in the room the kids stop talking as if they don't want me to hear whats being said, my hubby has told them many times that he loves me and not their mother and he will never leave me but they still push the issue the kids are 7 and 13 and you'd think that since i have been around this long they would realize their efforts to split us up wont work and that they would give up. well does any one know how we can get them to focuse on the futer insted of the past. Do give me any crap about privacey between bio parent and child because we're suppose to be a family not just people sharing a home.

I don't want to seem super cold hearted so I was wondering if I should just call her and say happy birthday or would that lead her on or complicate things?

20090202190152AAwPEzQ	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do I join and make a different group of friends?	long story semi-short...      I really dont like the friends that I have now... theyre all too-faced and selective with who they talk to. Im not even close with them and I only have one true friend. I want to ditch my group and join a different one (preferably the emo scene kids) because I think i have similar taste in music and style with them, unlike my current friends.      so how can i join their group when people know ive established myself in my current group? i know this is really lame to ask but my school is extremely clique-y and i want to hang out with people i can relate to.   im kind of reluctant to approach them because they seem very together and closed out to others... or could i be wrong?

We are a crazy, beer drinking, fun loving, rowdy bunch. Typically the bridal party dances to a slow song but what if we dance to Boom Shake The Room by DJ Jazzy Jeff? I was thinking we could all dance as one big group to eliminate any weirdness about dancing with people you don't know and it would get the party started and set the tone. We could all yell out the appropriate parts of the song that get yelled... What do you think?
20090202190503AAbqkCd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can I get an honest answer from a REAL MAN...?	Of course the most valuable advice gets 10 points.      Now I've been struggling with something for a long time. I have a beautiful daughter, and a really good relationship with her father. Our daughter is two years old and we've been in and out of a relationship for about five years. For the past 6 mos, I've been trying to get him to understand the position that I'm in. I'm single (by choice) I work full time (for now) and I'm presently enrolled in school to receive a bachelors in communications. I feel like I'm growing into the woman that I've always dreamed of being. So what's the problem? HIM. He's not changing. PERIOD. He's 8 yrs older than me (he might as well be 8yrs younger than me) and he can't grasp the concept of us just being friends. I don't want to be intimate, I want to be FRIENDS. He's always trying to find some way to come over. The more I resist the more he insists. I've noticed lately that he's been playing games. For example: If you tell me that you're bringing me money for the baby-I expect for you to show up. Don't have me calling you back to back just because I'm not letting you "have your way with me." That's no way to treat the mother of your child, and it hurts. Two years ago -1 month after the birth of my child-I found out that he was still living with his other child's mother. It turned me off, pissed me off, and hurt me deeply. After that, things weren't the same. At first it was competition, because as you men know women can be very territorial. But after a while, it was like "for what?" I just got tired. Now that I'm tired of him and not chasing, racing and pacing, he's starting to act like a little B****. How can I get through to him? I know its hard to leave a chick like me alone but damn! LOL-Naw I'm jokin, but seriously can a MAN offer any advice besides ignoring him because we know that's not realistic considering we have a child together....   Thanks ahead of time for your input.   F.Y.I I honestly didn't know that he was still with the first woman, I don't like leftovers.
20090202190725AAUwNM4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My gut tells me to fight for this relationship, but I am unsure. Maybe I should just move on?	My girlfriend and I of four months just broke up and I am not quite sure what direction I should go in. I feel like she knows exactly how I feel because I clearly told her that I was willing to fight for her no matter what, but she felt as though it was better for us to not be together. Part of the reason for that was because of the fact that the feelings that she still had for her ex are still a factor for her and she said that she still had love for him. But she regretted the fact that her and I got together as a couple when she had only previously left him after a few weeks prior. But she said right after that that she did date me because she wanted to be with me, but she felt like we shouldn't be together because of those lingering feelings for her ex and the fact that she is not giving me her all. At that point, I said I would rather have her as is and we can work through the rest, but she then said she wouldn't feel right because she felt like I was settling for her when her mind wasn't right and she wasn't able to give me her all.. Now, she told me that she loved me and that's why she was doing that, but if she didn't care about me then she would just stay with me. But.. I don't get that.. What should I do when my gut tells me to fight for her?

20090202191158AAwLzwh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I tell her...?	This will probably be pretty long, but there's a lot to explain.  I'll try to cut it down as much as possible.  So I met this guy over the summer, who instantly liked me.  Soon after school started again, we began dating.  Sadly, I fell in love with him, and he broke up with me for my best friend somewhere in September and October...  They started going out November 1st.  I don't know why I stayed friends with them, but I did.  I care about them both too much.  I couldn't bear to lose them anymore than I already did.  Anyway, my friendship with both of them was really rocky until recently, and now we're all really close again.  Except... me and him got a little too close... We didn't have sex, but we were messing around... a lot.  This was just yesterday.  I feel so guilty.. but I couldn't stop myself.  He felt really guilty, I could tell.  We agreed to just forget about it.  He doesn't care about me.  Well, not like he cares about my best friend, and I knew that all along.  We were just having fun.  But I don't know if I should tell her... should I?

20090202191639AAKEDuL	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	If some asks me why we don't have kids, what would the answer be?	Men and my wife has went to several restaurants with no kids. We live in a childfree arrangement. People with kids asks us if we have kids or why we don't have kids. I have no answer. I would go up and say that I personally resent kids. I know the overwhelmingly majority of people look down on people who are childfree and/or despises children.      When someone asks me and my wife why we never have kids, what would the answer be?

20090202192227AANoZPA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would any girl date a special needs guy?	If there was a guy who was really nice inside and couldnt help his disability, would any women go out with him? If a guy was very retarded, is he able to find a date that is non retarded???       Now let me ask you women this, what if this guy had aspergers or something and he called you a c*nt and was so abusive but he didnt mean to be. Would you say in a nice sweet way: "Please stop. thats not nice?" or would you blow him off and swear back at him for him treating you mean. Even if he felt ashamed that he called you a name and as treating you horrible?

20090202191844AAO8ogQ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help with a boy please?	i know this is long....but please read it? :)   so there is this guy who i have had a thing for for about the last 2 years. it all started back in the happy days of 9th grade. so here i am, this girl who has been reallly depressed for the last couple of months. its a new semester and this guy in one of my classes starts noticing me. hes 'popular' atheletic, outgoing-the whole shabang. he always tells me i'm way hot and he kisses me on the cheek, flirts out the freaking wazoo with me... i was basically the happiest girl ever. but he was so intimidating to me i never could get the words formed in my brain because i was so smitten by his beauty:). so anyway he goes to a different high school after that year. he lives about two minutes away from me. i never see him anymore and i still want him. i still haven't gotten past thinking he is the most perfect guy ever. no other guy like him has ever gone for me. they will all tell me they think i'm hot but they never try to make a move like he did. i'm scared i'll never get over him. how do i get in contact with him again?
20090202192928AA8zgLz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	(FOR GUYS EASY 10 PTS!!!!!) Do guys like girls that...?	.....Dont usually show emotion, my friends tell me that I'm always neutral and passive and that I'm immpossible to read because I barely show any emotion, even though I do feel it I'm just dont really show it on my face ( lot's of practice with my parents) unless I'm REALLY upset or happy or something. I'm rarely affected when people criticize me, I'm only affected when they critisize me on something that would really upset me like my dyslexia but other than that I dont really care. I'm usually quiet till you get to know me then I'm really a chatter box( not in an annoying way) My question is do guys like girls like this, since there's less drama and all? be honest
20090202192736AArbUzM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Seriously annoying??Advice?

So me and this girl are really good friends, and she has this brother who is really sweet, but sooo shy.

I think he knows that I am interested..we are both 17=)
20090202192630AA7a1TP	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Will my so called wife's new relationship last?	Yes I have asked this question before. YOU DON'T HAVE TO ANSWER IT! I enjoy reading all of your answers.      My wife left 1-9-09. She has moved in with a guy. Yes as a couple. She is 27 and I found out he is 37. She moved out of here and straight there. I also just found out that him and his wife separated in November. It my have something to do with my wife. Don't know that for sure. They both work at the same place. Friday night I called her. Yea to see if she would come home. She told me how happy she is and how much better f**k he is. Also I let her take the kids Thursday. She told our kids that her bf can't wait to meet them and she was getting a puppy. I will not let her take them around him. I told her to give the kids time to adjust and she said she has. BS 3 weeks!! She also told me she is going to take the kids. I have filed for custody. I don't think I can do that again. We have two kids together that are with me. We have been married 8 years.I thought everything was fine. We had a few spats. But we were doing better than ever with jobs,credit and getting along. She has done this before. Will that relationship last? Do you think she will get payback for doing this to me and my kids? No this is not any of my business. I just want my chance to turn her away like I should have done years ago. The only reason I ask is because I really tried the last two years. It looks like she came out so much better after doing this to us. They have only been living together a few weeks so I will have to see.      I will add that she has done this so many time that the kids don't even miss her. Nothing has changed and one of them said they wanted to live with me because I was a better parent. Now that came from a 9 year old!      I don't want to see it last not because I don't want her to be happy. I just want to her to see that you don't walk out on your family for someone else!
20090202191954AAB7WW9	Family & Relationships;Family	Me and my parents aren't getting along so well...?	Me and my parents have always gotten along really well.... until now. Now I know what with the recession and all they are stressed out, but I feel like I can't please them at all! On my last progress report I came home with a perpetual 4.0 and they didn't say anything... except for "we are a straight A family, and we won't get anything else!" They're also always crabby... usually at me! Like, for example, I really shouldn't be on the computer right now, because they always find something wrong with my being on it... like I made a mess upstairs (which wasn't my fault... I don't want to explain it) and so now they are calling me "little miss princess" because I am sitting down here on the computer while they are upstairs working! It's like I have no fun anymore because of all the things i am not allowed to do!!!!! Is there some way I could please my parents beyond a shadow of a doubt, or is there something that I could say to them... Please, no stupid answers! It just feels like they have no idea what being a shy teenager is all about. Like a couple days ago i didn't want to have to go to youth group because I don't know anybody there. So I went to go ask pardon of my dad. U know what he said???? "If you stay home, stay in your room because I don't wanna see your face knowing my daughter is a social misfit!"!! And I love my parents DEARLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But I'm getting so frustrated! What do I do???

I don't really know him that well but someone told me that he wanted my number or something so I know he has some sort of interest in me. I see him quite a bit around school and some times after school. I really don't want to mess this up but I'm not sure what I want to do. I was thinking about getting my friend to get him to ask me out but I don't really want to do that and I don't want him to tell him myself. I kinda want to somehow get to know him a little bit better without just going up to him or having one of my friends go up to him and just randomly ask him questions about himself. What should I do? How can I get us to a point where either he asks me out or what can I get one of my friends to say that won't necessarily just plain out say ask her out?
20090202191905AAnieJ7	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Know of any good websites about marriages failing because arguments about the ex wife and step children?	I love my husband. This is his second marriage and my first. I just feel like he defends her when she is so obviously wrong. We even had to go to court in the beginning because she was very harassing. She is even the one who had an affair on multiple occasions which finally ended their marriage. We fight about her and the kids. He has two from his previous marriage. They are wonderful children and we have a good relationship. I just want him to see that he needs to include me in decisions. We recently moved a little further away from the kids to get a decent house for all of us that we could afford. He is now talking about moving closer again. We just moved in this past September! I love them all very much. I am looking for a website about failing marriages due to the struggles of exes and their children. I did find one but can't find again. Please help. I am hoping it will help us.

I have tried to understand her for such a long time. She has mood swings, just like me... but more often. One day, she'll be angry, the next, she's like "Hey, how are you!" Smiling and everything. I've taken her out 2 times, but don't think it was what she was looking for. First she says a plain meeting is fine. I told her okay, you could chose. Then she tells me, you pick something... lol. Huh? She doesn't talk about what she likes... And, we are only friends, but I do like her quite a bit. I don't know what she thinks of me to be honest. I think she wants us to be friends which I respect. So as a friend, where should I take her? What to wear? etc. Valentines day coming ...

20090202192345AAlg7cH	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I learn to keep my mouth shut?	This girl I know, one week before her wedding allowed herself to get badly sunburned.  I told her that she was silly since she was wearing a strapless gown and she had bright red singlet marks on her upper torso and the tops of her arms were bright red.  She informed me that she was getting a fake tan and this would cover it up.  In the photos all you see is the bright red and the patchy orange streaks of fake tan. In fact she had o hide a finger up her husbands sleeve whe getting photos of the rings as it was orange!! I mentioned that it was a pity as your wedding photos are a life momento.  So as you can gather I am considered to be rude and nasty.  Does anybody agree?

20090202192356AA3hg3Z	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this normal..? Guy problem?	For some reason, whenever I like a guy I find it really easy to talk to him. And if people tell me he likes me back, I still find it easy.    Except if I go out with that guy, I become a lot more shy. I don't talk as much, and it feels like there's nothing really to talk about, and then it becomes awkward. I'm a shy person. But what I don't understand is that shouldn't I be more shy when I'm not sure if he likes me, because then I'll be more aware of what I'm saying & doing to make him like me more? But then when we start going out it seems like I worry too much about what he thinks of me. It sucks.. :(

I asked her why and she said that she was still hurting over this guy who broke up with her 3 MONTHS AGO.      Now, I didn't really understand why she still feels the way she does, but I've been trying.      She says that no matter how hard she tries, she can't get over him. So I don't really know what advice to give her or what to say. My only idea for why she feels the way she does is because she gave her virgintiy to the guy.      So, I don't know.    Help me. Please.

20090202192932AAMrzg7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would he feel more connected to me for these reasons? Would this make him more inclined to like me?	Okay, last November I went to an indoor tennis clinic, and there was a guy checking me out A LOT. He would look me right in the eyes and then look away. Basically, i totally got the sense that he liked me. Believe it or not, he was TOTALLY my type! He is a geek w/ glasses, he has curly dark brown hair, he was kinda stocky/quite built. He is extremely Jewish looking, and has a huge, hooked nose. He is about 5'7. At the tennis place, i would usually wear cute little tennis outfits, but i always wore my glasses (i cannot play tennis w/o them!). I also have brown curly hair (that i usually tied baq when playing tennis), and i had a HUGE HOOKED BEAKY nose. I was quite Jewish looking as well. I am 5'4 1/2. I have tics (i sniff and i move my head to the side), and believe it or not, this sexy dude has tics as well (he sniffs and he blinks). Would my similar looks to this guy (and my tics) make him more inclined to liking me?    Wait... it continues. This summer i got my nose fixed (and now it is anything BUT hooked). Then, i started volunteering somehwere and he volunteers there too! When i volunteer, i never have my glasses on or look geeky. I usually wear tight, victoria's secret PINK or hard tail pants, a couple of times i wore a juicy couture jacket, and two times i wore a low cut cleavage shirt. I carry a Betsey Johnson bag when i volunteer. Lately, this guy usually sees me with my hair straight, or down underneath a cute little bucket hat. Do you think he probably likes me more now, or does he feel like he cannot connect with me as much? (yes, i still have the tics!) I am 17 y/o & he is 16 y/o.

20090202192926AA23ygK	Family & Relationships;Family	My dad is too overprotective?	Okay, well my dad is wayy to overprotective. One little thing like if I'm talking to a guy on AIM and he sees and he goes bizzerk on ME, not the guy but ME..as if it's my fault. I'm 15 and 2 months now and I think I'm old enough to be dating. My mom seems to understand completely but I feel like my dad will never understand. Ever.. and this guy I really really like (he's 17) he wants to take me to his senior prom. I want to go, and I think my mom will be okay with it but I don't think my dad will. And I want to go so bad cause he is such a good guy! I'm still a virgin, got my first kiss 2 months ago, and I've never done anything more. He can trust me but he says he doesn't! Do you think I'm old enough to date, what should I do? :(

What should i say when he makes those comments?And i know he loves me,every guy just wants a sexy girlfriend.
