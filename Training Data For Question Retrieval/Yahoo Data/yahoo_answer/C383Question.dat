20090220114438AA0dLVj	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Hot Water Tank(Only Slightly Warm)?	Is there a reason our hot water tank is only putting out slightly warm (about less than lewk warm) water? We usually use an electric water heater but ours broke recently so until then we're using propane. But my dad says it could be because since we hadn't used the water tank in maybe three months, the heaters could of gotten corroded (like crusted over with drying water and what not) Is that possible? Or is there someway to heat up the water manually (like a switch/knob to increase output in heat) Before we started using the electric one the water would get pretty hot (the sink water could get hot enough to where if you stuck your hands under it for too long it'd hurt a little)      We're most likely just going to get a certified propane guy to check it soon, but to save us the cost (which'll cost about 100$+) Is there anyway to find out for ourselves.      Thanks in advance.

20090220111410AAY0ykG	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Humidity level in my house?	I live in Ontario Canada. The temp outside is -4 celcius. All winter my house seems really dry and we have itchy skin. I bought a gagit thing that measures the humidity level in the house and it's between 25-27%. That is really low and dry so I decided to check the level of the humidstat on the furnace humidifier. It was set to 20% humidity so I put it up to 30% because it all depends on the outside temp. I also turned up the blower to high as it was on medium. So far there is no difference in the dry air in my house. Is there anything else I can do to increase the humidity for the winter months? Should I just keep turning up the humidstat thing to like 40% to get a good level?

We have compromised with the following, but I still need a little help I think......   Walls- a nice sagey green color with cream coloured baseboards   Couch- a tan color with stripes   Cofee/end tables-  a light "cabin-look" wood   Curtains- a tan linen quality, to the floor (we have large windows)       I have the following picture  http://www.flickr.com/photos/30998834@N0...     that has served as my inspiration for these color choices, where else could I add colors, maybe some pops of yellows from the inside of flower? I think this whole idea is good, but it seems a little plain, how can we jazz it up a bit? Any help would be great! Thanks!!!

20090220124720AAZCxur	Home & Garden;Cleaning & Laundry	Do most bugs live with others?  I found one in my closet.  Are there more?	I just found a bug in one of my sheets in my linen closet.  It looks like a very little caterpillar...orange with brown fur/stripes on the top.  You can only see the stripes when it moves though; otherwise it's just brown on the top.  It's less than a cm long.  Does anyone know what this bug is called and if there could be more?  I'm deathly afraid of bugs and am afraid to look.

20090220125541AAvtaDu	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Is this girl stringing me along? You decide. Please Help?	Okay so I met this girl who I've come to like as of recent. I contact her through email only and see her during class time. I asked her to come meet up with me at a coffee shop to hang out and study; as well as to give me her cellphone number so I could text her. She didn't want to give me her number because she said she doesn't have an unlimited text messaging package, but she agreed to come to starbucks to study for our exam. What does this mean, is she hinting she only wants to be friends? Does she have a boyfriend and shes not telling me? I cant check facebook because she disabled her account; and my feelings are telling me that she doesn't have boyfriend because we are too flirty during our project meetings.

20090220130333AArTABk	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Ideas on how to decorate my small studio apartment?	I'm trying to go with a modern contemporary look with a pop of color and black and white artwork. My canopy style daybed will function as a couch and my bed and has a cabana feel with it's own canopy(white) from zgallerie.        My ultimate theme is old fashioned couture so I want rich colors and all my artwork is of old fashion icons and actresses. My major problem is that we're not aloud to paint the walls so i was thinking about putting fabric up to cover them and I also heard of fabric coverings or something that make fabric stick to the walls. My bed is black and the canopy is white so I need a color scheme to go with that. All ideas are welcome.
