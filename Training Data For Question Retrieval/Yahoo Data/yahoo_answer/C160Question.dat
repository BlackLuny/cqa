20090203103920AARpa29	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Why are poor teenagers more likely to get pregnant than middle class/wealthy teenagers?	Not to say all, but statistics show that more teenagers from the poor class tend to get pregnant more often compared to teenagers from middle class/wealthy income families. It is true that some teenagers from middle class/wealthy income families do get pregnant, but statistics show that it more likely occurs in low income families. Why is this?
20090203104031AAcpXf6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Is birth control safe/ or is something wrong?  18 plus kinda detailed*?	My boyfriend and I are working on putting our lives together. Rings half paid off looking at houses etc...We were talking about having kids. And had the worry if we even can. We have been together 5 years and have been having sex for about 4 years and 6 months of that time. (we were both virgins when we started having sex)  There was times I wasn't 100% on taken my pills, and we stopped using condoms after about a year. So it was just my pills and still weren't safe (he didn't always pull out)    We worry that there might be something wrong. Or is it just that birth control is working? I was about 85lbs when I started taken birth control at age 16. And that was because I was having period problems.    I'm now about 110-115lbs age 21 and he's 23 now.   If there is something wrong we both agreed no drugs/shots etc. And both right now aren't for adoption.   We both want to parents when the time is right. But don't want to find out we only have so much time/it be to late.   I'm really worried since at the age of 31 my mom found out she had cancer. I have already had the same abnormal cells she had. At 29 she found out she couldn't have any more kids. My parents wanted 4+ and didn't get that time.    HELP

20090203105511AA9KLx8	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Should My 12 year old stepson still be acting like a girl? Can he be brained washed to act female?	I met my stepson when he was 7 years old and he would put towels around his head to make his hair long, than wrap a towel around his waist to wear a skirt. At age 9 years old he went shopping with my cousin and wanted to look at the girl shoes.         He still likes dolls and what not. Than he does strange things when he gets around his father like he will lay on the floor and get in the fetal position with his butt sticking out or sometimes he just bends right over when his dad is around. I feel there is something terribly wrong with this kid.         Not to mention he still loves toddler TV shows, and he eats with baby spoon. He has  22 month old brother he uses his spoons when the 22 month old uses the big people spoons. I know his mom walked on him when he was one and half. He was raised by  his grandma who bought him barbie dolls, great grandma, his aunties were really young when they took care of him.       The kid is really messed up.

Well she came to school yesterday all high and s***. anyway shes mad at me because i dont approve of what shes doing and im open about it. I keep telling myself that i dont care about her and that its her life but i lose sleep wondering if that was the ;ast time ill ever see her. She skips school weeks at a time claiming that she was "sick". Yesterday she flipped out on me because i didnt want my phone waving around in front of the teachers i got frustrated and kind of shouted at her. Then she said i was being a dick. This is very common with our relationship. I dont do anything wrong and she flips out on me. Should i just cut all ties with her and let her have even fewer friends here or should i just count my blessings that she does come to school occasionally. Help...

I've thought about letting him sleep with his little security blanket, but I'm just really nervous about the idea.  I can't let him go to sleep with it and then take it away a little later b/c when I move it he wakes up...      Just wondering when you let your baby start sleeping with something like that...

20090203120138AAgL2Fc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Children's noise at a residential swimming pool - what do you think?	I live in an apartment complex. There is a swimming pool with some apartments on one side of it. There are strict rules attached to its use - time factors etc. It is usually too cold for me but I have encouraged my son-in-law to bring my grandson to use it as he loves the water. My daughter and I had hoped he would help with his swimming as she has had to discontinue his lessons because of the cost and his father was a very successful competitive swimmer when he was young. He has only used the pool a few times himself and been accosted by the Body corp manager every time for one reason or another - mostly because they didn't know who he was, which was fair enough in my opinion (but not in his).   Recently the family including my other daughter, came over on a hot Saturday. Only my SIL and other daughter and grandson went to the pool to keep the numbers down (only 4 from each unit allowed).    My son-in-law came back really angry. He said the Manager told him that there were doctors in nearby units who did shift work and that there were complaints that Sam was too noisy. My s.i.l. and my daughter both said all Sam was doing (he is 3) was talking normally and he told the Manager that people who do shift work, as he once did, have to put up with noise in the day. I put this in an email to our Body Corp Manager as well saying anyone who does shift work shouldn't live near a swimming pool. She replied that my grand-son was squeeling very loudly because s.i.l. was throwing him in the air. She said people from distant units complained (I don't believe her) and that she could hear him from hers which is nearby, that I do believe).   I am caught up in the middle of this and it is quite upsetting.   For one thing their versions are different and I think perhaps  both sides are stretching the truth. Sam probably was squeeling and not just "talking normally" as my son-in-law said but also I don't believe anyone complained but the Body Corp Manager was probably over sensitive about noise for fear there would be complaints.   What do you think?

20090203122916AAYlC73	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Should a mother be forced to pay child support?	Consider this scenario: A man and a woman have sex. The woman gets pregnant and wants to get an abortion or at least put the baby up for adoption. The man, however, wants to raise the child. Should the man be able to force the woman to have the baby? Furthermore, let's suppose that in this relationship the woman was the bread winner, the person who earned by and far the most income. Let us also suppose that the woman has stated that she does not want to have a child nor does she want any involvement in the child's life. Should the man be able to force her to pay child support if he is able to make her carry the pregnancy to term?      The reason I ask this is because I'm curious as to what people's opinions on child support are when the stereotypical gender roles are reversed in a common scenario.

Oh well so anyway I don't want to get into a huge debate on guns in the home, but I'd like some advice.  Initially I was just going to let it go, but the more I think about it the angrier I am getting.      I don't want any guns in my home.  It's just my personal preference, and my husband is okay with it.  If others choose to have guns in their homes I have no problem with it as long as they're kept safely and there is NO way a child can get to them.      Anyway, my brother is a lover of all things guns.  Fine.. At least he has a hobby.  But he knows that I am not interested in guns, shooting ranges, hunting etc.  And he knows about my feelings regarding keeping a gun in my home.     So he came over with his kids the other day.  My kids were home and we had a couple of family friends over.  My brother being the attention crazed person that he is chose to pull out his big old gun and brag to my husband and his friends about it.  In front of my children.  In my home.  I know a lot of you may criticize me or tell me to let it go, but it was very inconsiderate of him to do that.  I know he did it just for attention because he thinks he's cool.  He had a total disregard for the way I feel and the rules of my home.  Should I confront him or let it go?      If it matters my brother is in his 40's and he is older than me.

I have tried several others & none of them seem to be working either. I've also tried putting juice & water in his bottle but as soon as he realizes what it is he pushes it away & throws a fit.

20090222201305AAbGDAK	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Why are people so bad at parenting now, no one disciplines their child about inappropriate behaviour in public?	I don't get it as the parents of these badly behaved kids must have been disciplined by their parents as that's the way it was in the past. So why are they so scared to give their kids a good telling off when it's warranted. Seriously, they do seem scared of their kid becoming emotionally upset or not liking them. Examples being: I know it's not parents but a school group at an observation tower I was at recently where me & the other members of the public were enjoying this fantastic view of the city, then the school group arrives - the kids were about 10 so should have known better - they ran around, tried to break the binoculars there for the public to use, yelled all over the place. Their teachers said & did nothing about it & let them run riot. The people running the observation tower ignored them also even though myself & all the other adults there were glaring at the kids & their teachers. When I was at school we would have gotten a little pep talk from our teachers before going to something like that - we'd be told you're representing your school so behave & don't make noise, etc. If we did misbehave we would be told off.      The next day I was on a plane & the maybe 8 to 10 year old kid behind me kicked & punched the back of my seat the whole time. I glared at his parents & they looked embarrased, yet failed to tell him off. He then stood up on the seat in his shoes & yelled out stuff. The parents & airline staff did nothing, even though me & the other passengers were looking on, appalled. He was way too old to be behaving like that.      If you go to the movies & parents are there with their kids they let their kids talk loudly throughout the whole film & if you say something they say, he's just a kid, etc. But they always look embarrassed & don't know what to say when I ask them, so when you were his age you did that at the movies? Obviously not, so why won't they tell their kid to shut up? I'm tired of asking people to tell their kids how to behave.      The worst is when you're in the changing rooms of clothing stores & an unsupervised kid comes & opens the curtains while you're getting changed, exposing you naked to the whole store!!!

20090222201450AAhtM3c	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Wondering about this pain that I have in between..?	Ok, I will be 20 weeks (5 months) tomarrow!  I was experiencing this a while before I began feeling quickening and it stopped for a while and now it's back.  It is this weird pain that seems to feel like some sort of pressure right in between my legs, like birth canal area.  I really can't explain the feeling other than pressure, but it hurts sparingly.  I will be sitting down and I stand up and feel it, or I move something with one foot while balancing with the other and it hurts, or sometimes when I walk.  It's like the baby is very low and it's just spreading the pelvic region where baby comes down into the birth canal.  I have only thought of it to be the baby applying pressure but I plan to ask my doc at my next visit, so I am just wanting some opinions.  If you have any suggestions or ideas please do tell.  Thanks in advance!      -B*T-   Mom of 1, 19w 6d w/ #2!   My 1ST ultrasound in 5 days!

20090222202149AAOpVS9	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is this normal? Need advice.?	I had a missed miscarriage at 6 weeks and had a D & C 4 days ago at 11wk, 2 days. I was told that I would experience some cramping and bleeding. I am concerned because I have had absolutely no bleeding and barely any cramping. What cramping I do have, is very intense but no bleeding at all... not even a little pink. When my dr's office called the next day to check on me after surgery, I told them what was happening and the nurse said she would ask the dr and call me back... I never heard back from them. Is this normal? I am concerned that with no bleeding, I will have a higher risk for infection or maybe that something has gone wrong. Does anyone have any advice?

(Yes, I know...world's worst mother..formula is poison...I've heard it all before)      Anyway, that was all 5 months ago, and just recently, my doctor prescribed me Domperidone, in the form of motilium..for nausea related issues, and I've been reading that it is a drug used to try and increase breast milk (OR maybe I am mistaken, I'm not sure!)      My breasts have been leaking a little, and feeling a little more fuller than usual.      Are these related??

(for those who don't know I adopted 10 months ago)      She is unable to see them, has serious issues etc. etc. etc.  I tried to arrange a meeting with her at Christmas time, but it was too hard for her, and I understand that.  I told the workers whenever she wanted to I am available.        In the meantime I am going to work I think on some kind of scrapbook or something to send to social services, and they pass it on to her, if she wants it.      But the more I think about it, the more superficial it seems to me, and I am having a hard time getting my head around it.  Right now the kids can't be involved, as it would be too hard for them as well.  So it would be just me (and hubby) and I have no idea what to do.  Just pictures?  Pictures and journal?  Does she want pic's of jsut the kids or of us too?      I woudl appreciate comments from all, but am really really interested in First mom's and adoptees in reunion.  What would you have wanted to see in this kind of situation?  What would be too hard?  What would seem too silly? etc. etc. etc.      Rambling, but hopefully it all makes sense.  Want to do what is right, and not offend in the long run.  Don't want to go on about what a great life they have, but want to make sure she knows that they are doing alright.      Thanks.

20090222211711AAqL1D6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Question About Twins & Miscarriage?	I went to look at my records at the hospital. I found out that there were actually two sacs seen on the ultrasound but the doctor told me that she saw nothing (WTF?)!      This morning, I had a heavy cramp. I began to bleed burgundy (it never turned bright red) and it was not enough to soak a pad. I only saw it when I wiped.      After about an hour, the cramps stopped and then maybe 3 hours later, I released one 'mass' that LOOKED like it could've been a placenta.      I am going to the doctor this week just to check up on things but a lot of my friends are insisting that I get my HCG levels checked again b/c of the double sac. FYI, I am no longer bleeding. I have a pad on right now and even when I go wipe, its nothing there.      For those of you who miscarried a twin, did this happen to you? Maybe I'm holding on to a thread of hope but Im more pissed that the doctor LIED and said there was nothing there, yet when I go get my records, there are two obvious sacs with arrows point to "sac 1 and sac 2."      Thoughts anyone???

I need holiday suggestions from people living in australia (because people living in the US suggest places closer to them which are extremely expensive for us to get to lol). Ok so I have a 3 year old and a baby who will be around 6 months old when we want to go on a holiday. I was thinking of places like the gold coast, NZ, Bali, Thailand etc. Not sure what our budget is, we have quite a bit of money saved up but it's not all meant to be for a holiday. Umm, I basically want to know some good places to take kids the age of ours and places with things to do that arent hard to get around for people who have never been there before (I am only 23 and have only ever been overseas once) : )

20090222211147AAY2Rt2	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Co-sleeping mommies how do you do it safely?	So I have been co-sleeping with my baby since she was first home from the hosptial (actually in the hospital too) (shes 4 weeks old now) I orignally started co-sleeping because she wouldn't sleep in her bassinet or crib... She would scream and cry and I knew something was wrong with her.. she has a really bad reflux problem and is put on medicine to try and help it (Glad I didn't listen to all the people who told me to let her cry it out!) So for the next couple weeks until her meds start to help I want to continue to co-sleep and I'm just wondering how you mommies safely co-sleep... I'm a really light sleeper (my husband is a heavy one so she doesn't sleep by him) we don't smoke or drink or anything       Don't lecture me on co-sleeping the doctor actually told me today letting her sleep on her back in her crib right now is going to be more harmful than co-sleeping.. because she has reflux so bad and is vomitting and is still so young that she might choke on her puke...

HI all, on good ole V-Day me and my g/f  had oral sex and touched eachother, she did at one point have her genitals near my boxers but I was all zipped up =]      Sadly, she was due for her period yesturday or a little before and hasn't had it, and has no symptoms what-so ever.      As far as we know, no sperm came even close to her vagina, unless some was on my hands or hers ect... but even if there was any to get in, which I doubt, it wasn't much and most likely was dry/dead...      So, with all the information give, should we be worrying as much as we are? We were very careful and my penis didn't make any direct contact at all, in fact- I didn't even ejaculate. All pre-***.      Thanks.

I need help in this one, Im basically an only child sense my older brother moved out with his wife and kid, and I have talked with my parents about adopting a girl sense they always wanted one. My mom has asked me a couple of times why I want them to adopt and around what age. My reason is because they always wanted a girl but couldn't have one, also because all my friends have sisters and I feel weird going places with them and they taking care of their sisters(So i feel, yes, jealous of them) I REALLY want a sister so bad and around my age too, im turning 15 this may, so she could be in Middle or High school. Also I overheard my mom talking to one of her friends about this adoption thing and she sayed "We Might Adopt, we don't know yet" And I don't want to get my hopes up. How can I get on the topic again with them and maybe convincing them? Also My mom has told me that by adopting I have to share My stuff, But I really don't care. And were can I print some information about adopting and all the process that we have to go thru? (We live in Houston,Texas if thats a Diff) THANKS!

But the last 6 months, since starting Kindergarten, she's been holding in her bowel movements.  Now it's causing her pain and some constipation.  She got a hemorroid last week because of it.  She almost always has poo streaks in her panties.  Sometimes it's so bad she smells.  She has to change her undies atleast 2 times after school.  I don't know what else to do for her.  We have wet wipes in the bathroom to make it easier to wipe.  If she has gas I encourage her to try to go, but she says it hurts and she won't.  The only thing I haven't tryed is a stool sofener, but I don't think she's constipated all the time, just when she holds it in.  At first I thought she was just being lazy and not wanting to wipe.  But I think it's much more than that.  Any ideas???        I'm calling the dr first thing in the morning.  Just want to see what everyone else thinks.      Thanks in advance.

I'm not 100% sure that I'm pregnant, since I haven't been able to get an appointment with my doctor due to scheduling conflicts, but all the signs point to pregnancy and also I have had 3 incredibly faint positive tests among a sea of negative tests.      That being said, for the past 2 weeks I have been itching like crazy! The itchiness is mostly on my back and drives me nuts all day. It seems to also be on my upper chest and today my stomach started to itch too! There is no rash and my detergents haven't been changed or anything.      So my question is.......      Is itchiness on the back (or anywhere else on the body) a sign/symptom of pregnancy? If so, when did you start to experience it and where? What helped to alleviate the itching for you?

20090222222149AApGrcH	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Feeling a little blue while pregnant normal or something serious?	Since the beginning of my 2nd trimester i have felt very sad and depressed. I don't think about hurting myself or anything, just really sad. Like i don;t know what i am doing. How do i prepare for this baby? I am scared to talk to my doctor for fear that she would call social services or something. I had that happen before when i was a child, went to a therapist said i was depressed so they called social services. I have always suffered from depression since i hit puberty. but never medicated. I don't know if its possible to have Post par tum depression while pregnant, or just my hormones. another reason i don't want to talk to my doctor is that i was raised very old fashioned by my grandmother who taught me not to say anything about depression to anyone. Just deal with i. my question is, is it normal to feel depressed and lonely during pregnancy, even with a husband around to support you??

20081113155412AAM7dWE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Babysitting problem. Advice?	I babysit a 6 year old who takes a LOT of energy. She's not the kind who is happy with crayons and paper.      Her mom only pays me $3/hour when I usually charge $6. I know she has financial problems so that's why I accept that.         Anywho, this morning at 7 AM she calls and says her daughter is having problems at school and needs a day off. And asked if she could come over right then. I said yes and she came and dropped her off.         So she came to get her and this was our conversation.      "She was here for 8 hours, so is it going to be $30 or...?"   "What?! How come you didn't tell me $30 this morning? I could get daycare for cheaper than that!"   "I was asking if it was going to be $30, not telling. Sorry for the confusion."      So I kept my cool when I really wanted to say something along the lines of... go find a daycare then! lol         Seriously. What the heck.

The answers I got were great. Thanks! So..now I am wondering..is it ABSOLUTELY too early to test 5-6 days before your missed period. I just really wanna know. See, back in feb. I had a miscarriage after only 7 weeks since then I've really, really wanted to get pregnant again. My husband thinks it isnt the right time yet. I do though. I guess that it'll happen when I am not planning it. He said he would be great with whatever happens but yet thinks it isnt exactly the right time..:( I took a test again tonight and of course it said negative. My period is not due until the 30th or the 1st of october..do you think it just too soon??
20081005111712AAFCd94	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	So confused? Any advice...?	So, I am 24 and never had children before. In february of this year I had a miscarriage at 7 weeks. This month my period is about 2 days late..I just took a H.P.T. this morning and it says negative..this is in addition to the 4 other HPTs I took at the end of sept. because I just have "that feeling" that I conceived. Of course those earlier tests were negative because I think they were waaay too early to detect any HCG levels at all. Last time when I was pregnant I think I waited about 5 days after I missed my period to take the "First Response" test and I got that positive result. I have SOME minor symptoms of being pregnant. I would really like to think that I conceived because since I lost my baby I of course have been wanting us to get pregnant again:)  Also, my period is never late and just pretty much like clockwork..I usually start my period two days prior to the day I got it the month before if that makes sense(for example last month i got it on the 4th of sept. therefore I was expecting it this month around the 2nd or 3rd) ..I suppose my question here is: Is it still possible that those results were "false negatives" and should I wait another couple of days and retest? Or should I head straight to the dr. or e.r. and get a blood test?? I have been reading about "ectopic pregnancies" and am so scared that that is why there is no HCG detected. Because I miscarried and a D&C had to be performed afterward. I am afraid that puts me at risk for ectopic..I heard that anyway..yet, no official medical websites even mention that..so..I am confused!! :)

20090203125130AAmy9o0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	My 11-year-old son (5th grade) didn't want me to walk to school with him & I feel bad; what should I do?	(Continued from a PREVIOUS Question.)      CONTEXT: We (my wife and I) *HAVE* let him walk to school on his own EVERY SINGLE DAY.  It's just that I hadn't walked with him since early last December, and I was going for my walk anyway (the school is just around the fence and down the sidewalk, behind our house, so safety for the most part isn't too much of a concern).       Here are my other comments from the previous question:       I already mentioned to him (before he left) that I felt sad about it, and at least he said goodbye as usual. Part of me, though, wants to tell him that if he doesn't want to walk with me, I don't want to go to his soccer games. (And do NOT say this is childish, since we've had discussions with him previously about respecting other people's feelings -- especially his parents' -- and he will understand the proposition of "How would you feel, Son, if your Dad was embarassed to see YOU in public?".)  In my opinion, he has to realize that I have feelings too, and that if he loves me he would walk with me (AT LEAST ONCE EVERY WEEK OR TWO).  And don't say this is not practicing "unconditional love": I DO love him whether he walks with me or not; HE needs to learn that I respect his independence but that he should love me enough to walk with me one morning every week or two.       Thoughts?   ***      I'm his Father, actually.   ***      A lot of answerers assumed "mother"; I'm his Father, so don't assume.       Secondly, I haven't walked with him since mid-December (I was taking a break from morning walks). He *never* asks me to walk with him; I was just trying to get back to my walking routine & mentioned to him that I would like to start out my walk with him around the fence & down the sidewalk to his school.       Excuuuuuuuuuuuse me - just because I have feelings doesn't mean I'm acting "childish". IF some of you had kids of your own, you would realize that you san SAY you have feelings as a parent, but oftentimes kids don't know what that means (and certainly don't empathize). I think it is sad if kids don't learn to empathize.       So I'm not trying to get "revenge". I can respect that he wants to walk alone at times but he needs to realize that his Dad wants to walk with him now & then. Obviously, I don't want to force him to walk with me; if he realizes my sacrifice & love, he'll eventually want to again.   ***      When *I* was that age, if my Dad (or Mom) said they would walk with me, THAT WAS IT - I said nothing. And, I might add, I was happy they were with me, whether they were "cool" or not. It might seem out of date to you, but I OBEYED my parents: I wasn't perfect, but I HONORED and RESPECTED my parents (one of the ten commandments); and I knew that they would forgive me for anything I did wrong.

(She was facing my stomach instead of my back, and couldn't fit out that way.) If it hadn't been for that, I should have been able to deliver vaginally... I dilated to 10 and did well pushing until she got stuck. Anyway, I really want to have a VBAC this time, as my experience with the c-section was terrible. I'm really just hoping to hear some success stories to make me feel less nervous about it. Anybody have one to share? Thanks!

20080307143517AAlzDe1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	What are the characteristics of a spoiled teenager?	In your opinion, what makes a teenager spoiled? What are things that their parents do to spoil them? Do they act differently then non-spoiled teenagers? Do they have a different personality (e.g. work ethic, selfishness, etc.)? Do they have different expectations of their parents (e.g. getting a car for their 16th birthday)? Are there different levels of being spoiled? Please include as much detail as you can-- I want to know what people think about this issue. Here are some examples...      -Who should pay for the car? The insurance? The gas?   -Should parents buy their teens things, or meet them halfway on certain saving objectives?   -Should teenagers get an allowance?   -Do you think teenagers who are spoiled are more or less prepared for the real world? (Consider that they are better equipped for it, despite being less ready to face its economic, social challenges etc.)   -Who should buy extra things for teenagers (Cell phone, extra clothes, computer?) Do teenagers really need these things?

My hubbby and I have been married for 3yrs and we weren't planning on babies until next year, our only form of contraception was withdrawal for all this time, so last month we decided for me to get in the pill YAZ.

My last was taken on Sept.26 (last friday) I only took the pill for 14 days exact. I know this is the time around my ovulation time. Right after we ditched the pill we have been doing the bd everyday just in case.

But I was only on it for 14 days. Will I still ovulate this month? Is the pill affecting me? Why did I spot yesterday? Please help Ladies .....ever happened to any of you or anyone you know?

20081005111111AAG1ddX	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Prego.-Too Early to Tell-Good Chances?	 Hey ladies, me and my man have been trying to conceive for months on end with no luck and last night got me wondering. We've had sex and I've been less stressed without school. Well last night we went out to a UFC fight and I didn't even drink alcohol, I had maybe half of a Rock Star energy drink and I swear in a matter of about 5 hours, I urinated like 6-7+ times along with 2 times more till 2ish and more when I got home. I also have been quite moody as he affectionately tells me lol, have felt bloated-I know I urinated several times the other day at work after eating Subway and felt bloated after. I believe my period started around the 15th of last month and I think I am due around next Mon. We both have also been very frisky with a high libido for both of us and I thought I heard somewhere a guy prefers the smell of a woman when they are fertile or something like that.      Also after having my period, for some reason he had tons of energy for sex but he could'nt finish, finally I think like a wk after my period he did finish and had me pulled up on the edge of the couch with him kneeling (I sure hope I did shallow). My feeling is either I'm not prego or I hope I didn't miss my girl attempt. But with him going to the point a few times and not finishing, maybe the male sperm in there like a wk died off sooner than the girl sperm? I worry too because winter months are better boy months. I found out I was pregnant with my son in Dec. and now I worry. He thinks he has a good feeling about this time and his sister told me she wants to be an auntie :-)      Also last night someone told me I had "looked tired". I dunno, am I jumping the gun, or think I could be pregnant or a bad chance at girl attempt? My pH is usually 6ish and I need to work on getting it done :-(  I might've had like a whole quart of ice cream around then though so I hope that helps LOL      Another question, it seems since I met my man 've had weird periods. They almost seem irregular compared to what I was used to. I never really kept track per se before but it seems there are months I'm late, I think last month I was a week early, it's all really strange? Any explaination for that or why it seems so different now?      And I'm not sure what insurance I have bc of Job and Family, but could I go to Planned Parenthood and get a pregnancy blood test or something like that somewhere without waiting till my period is due?      Please Help Guys!!

20090203131018AATgcGh	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Anybody experience postpartum blues?	My delivery didn't go quite as I had planned.  I ended up with a c-section, as the baby went into fetal destress and became "stuck".  Baby came out perfectly healthy, but when trying to breastfeed, we realized I have flat nipple (who'd have known) plus baby has poor suck.  After 2 days of fighting her to BF, I gave into formula and decided once I got home, I would pump.  When we got home, finally, the baby screamed all night....litterally all night.  We got home on a Thursday around 1pm, she woke up at 3pm ate and began screaming.  She finally went to sleep, at 6:30 Friday morning.  This continued for weeks.  I tried pumping, but because you have to so often, I got to a point where it was pump or sleep, and sleep deprived mommy had to have some rest.  My baby cried and cried.  I cried and cried, my poor husband even cried.  This was not the baby we "ordered".  We had to move in with my in-laws for a couple of weeks just so we could take turns staying up.  The doctors changed her milk a few times, went from diagnosing "days and nights confusion, to reflux, to colic, etc...."  I was overwhelmed.  After dealing with 3-4 hour screaming spells, I was ready to rip my hair out and run away.  (All you "perfect" mothers would never understand)  I loved this child, but there were time I did not "like" her.  After about 4 weeks or so things have calmed down dramatically.  I'm so thankful.  I enjoy spending time with her so much.  She's a "happy" finally.  On occasion, she still has a "bad" night and I get frustrated again, but it's all worth it.        I just wondered if there were any other "IMPERFECT" moms out there who would share their story.      She was so "bad" the first month, hubby and I both agree that we'd never have sex again--just to ensure no more babies.  I actually wondered what I was thinking wanting to be a mommy....LOL  Now I know why I wanted to be a mommy....That sweet little smile will melt anyone's heart....   (now we're thinking about having another when she gets older).

20090203125922AAMdGiP	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	I've been pumping 4 my son (who was born 6 weeks early) for nearly 8 weeks & I feel like I can't do it anymore?	My preemie son was unable to get the hang of breastfeeding.. long story short it won't happen. I've had plenty of advice from nursing counselors and doctors to no avail. So i've been trying to give him what is best for him and I have been pumping breast milk every 2-3 hours for 8 weeks. I want what's best for him and I really don't want to stop giving him breast milk but I don't think there is another option. I can't go back to work pumping this much and we are just about out of money. I have to pump for 30 minutes out of every 2 hours to meet my son's demands and I feel like that's all I do now. I love my son and I want what's best for him so much but i'm torn between giving up my job and living on my husband's salary (which I can't stand doing- i feel helpless) and giving my son formula and going back to work (which I also can't stand the thought of). But I never want to see my breast pump again. Please help :(
20090203130456AAOYF9b	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is my birth control plan possibly the most effective of them all?	Tell me if this is the best plan for birth control:      Birth control pill   AND   Latex condom with water-based lubricant inside   AND   Nonoxynol-9 spermicide deep inside of vagina (as backup contraception and outside lubricant)      Why does using lubrication on the inside of a condom make it more necessary to lubricate the outside of a condom in order to keep it from breaking?      When using a condom, why is N-9 more effective when packaged separately rather than when it is already on a condom in the condom’s packaging?
20090203130653AAMCxsp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is my fiancee pregnant?	My fiancee and I are sexually active and she is on the pill. She has been on the pill for six months now and every one of those months she has been on time for her period, like clock work. I don't use a condom and I don's use the pull out method. I usually just ejaculate during oral sex, and never during intercourse. She is three days late, and like i said before, she has never been more than a day late since she has been on the pill. Is it possible that she could be pregnant? How long should we wait to take a pregnancy test? Thank you!

I have a 3 month old and a 22 month old...I want to get a double jogging stroller...my 22 month old daughter is tall for her age (always has been over the 100 percentile in weight and height)...I want to buy one for the spring and summer...but I don't want her to be too big...the point of a jogging stroller is so the mom can exercise...and sure a 22 month old can walk next to you...but they obviously can't go run 3 miles...so how long/how old were your kids?? thanks =)
20090203131806AAjqlDi	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	If I were to get pregnant, my boyfriend would want me to have an abortion.?	My boyfriend and I have had this discussion more than once with always the same outcome: If I were to get pregnant he would want me to abort the baby. This is all theoretical mind you. I am currently on birth control and take it regularly. There are times when I have forgotten, but always take it immediately the next morning.    It was brought up today in therapy (yes, our relationship is rocky) and of course it was unresolved. I am pro choice, but it is my choice to not have an abortion should I get pregnant. I would have the support of my family and friends. He feels that my choice to keep the child is selfish because it would ruin his life and I would take half his paycheck for 18 yrs. Even though I have said that I WOULDN'T do that (even though it is my right) he still doesn't want "half of him" running around. To this I say wear a condom. He then says that other guys don't have to do that because their girlfriends are willing to abort.       Another thing is that I have a severely handicapped brother who was brain damaged at birth. It was brought to my attention that if we were to have a child with down syndrome or any sort of disability, he would want it aborted as well. His reasoning is that how could you be proud of a child who will never be able to go to college, graduate high school, have an intellectual conversation with, etc. I find this extremely offensive because I work with developmentally disabled adults and know the joy and happiness they can bring to a persons life. Not to mention my brother who to me is the greatest big brother in the world. Who is to say that our "normal" child will go to college? When asked what he would do if our child was brain damaged at birth, he said that he would have done what the doctors had suggested to my mother: put the child in a care home. Essentially he feels that my brothers life is worthless and that he doesn't want to be a "servant" to a disabled child like my mother is to my brother. I understand he has his opinions but I find them extremely hurtful. I have a different perspective on things because of my personal history and I know I can't make him see my point of view. Part of me doesn't know what to do. This is obviously a huge disagreement and I'm looking for a bit of advice.
