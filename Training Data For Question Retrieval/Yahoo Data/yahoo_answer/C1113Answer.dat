JfOuzOJGaa	Pain is relative.  It didn't hurt me at all, but others have found it rather painful.  There's no telling how you're going to react to it.<br>  <br>  The best way to get it done is by going to a skilled piercer who will pierce it with either a 20g or 18g needle.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure where in the Bay Area you are, but I got my nose pierced at Industrial Strength in Berkeley.  Great employees, great atmosphere, incredibly clean, good prices, good quality jewelry, etc.|`|a503b666151ed0372de7a61b9a0a5dd4aa	On a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the worst i would give it a 3. It was a quick pinch and my eye watered and it was over. It took a total of like 5 seconds.<br>  <br>  The best way to get it done is with a needle, a gun can not be sterilized and it can shatter the cartilage in your nose. A gun is more likely to cause infection.<br>  <br>  Check and see if there is a "Factor 5" around your area. That's where i got my nose and my belly button pierced, they are amazing.<br>  <br>  If you get it done post a picture so we can see it, you will love it. I have had mine done for 6 months now.|`|RwY6mk43aa	i havent gotten mine done. but i saw my sister get it done. and she said it didnt hurt. her eyes watered a bit. but she said it wasnt that painful.

Cavz3kAPaa	I have a foot tattoo. I've seen some foot tattoos I really like, and others I don't. It all depends on what you are getting on them, and how it's placed<br>  <br>  For the person who said what is the point of a tattoo if you are just going to hide them. I get my tattoos for me, not for anyone else, and I know the stigma that goes with tattoo, for instance I want to be a teacher, so I can't go around with tattoos on my arms. And sometimes the occasion calls for a tattoo to be covered. My tattoos are significant to me, and me only, so why should I have to show them to everyone if I don't want to?|`|JfOuzOJGaa	Without knowing what the tattoo would be it's hard to say.  It might be a good place for a certain tattoo, but a bad place for another.  In general, I don't usually like foot tattoos.|`|N4U2oKwEaa	I have a tattoo on each foot.  I have 11 all together and those 2 were without a doubt the most painful.  I think (depending upon what it is) foot tattoos are beautiful.  If you're willing to put up with the pain, go for it!|`|MV0lMuDMaa	I think foot tattoos are awesome.  go for it.|`|PIUzpnVkaa	it's pretty popular and i think they're cool. the only thing is that because there's no fat there, just skin, then muscle, it's one of the most painful places to get it done.

OiLBE6hraa	your best bet is to do some research. ask friends/acquaintances whose hair you like where they get theirs done. websites like yelp and city-search are good to look at reviews people have wrote about the salons in your area. or look up salons in your area on the web. if they are a good salon with a pleased clientele they usually have a website. good luck!|`|yUpHZwTMaa	i like to find out where other people go, and how long and who they have do their hair before i go to get my hair cut.. ask your friends, or people you work with or something|`|cQJGaUK4aa	Word of mouth is your best answer, If you see someone with a great hair cut or style tell them you really like it and ask where they get their hair done....|`|xNjnvRSVaa	Heres what i would do:<br>  Go to your local mall, or wherever theres alot of people.<br>  If you see someone who's hair looks really good and you really like, compliment them on their hair then ask them what salon they go to and what the name of their stylist is. The salon shouldnt be too far away, considering your seeing this person at a local place.<br>  <br>  Its a simple way to find really good salons that have living proof that theyre good :)|`|oUFDH0Ztaa	this website has them all posted<br>  <br>  www.dramafeed.com/foryou

JfOuzOJGaa	If you have no idea what you're doing, then why would you risk horribly scarring yourself?  Save your money and get it removed professionally.|`|clInlnIqaa	If you do not know how to do it then why are you trying to do it yourself? You are going to severely injure and scar yourself by trying to do it yourself.|`|0X7DWnyeaa	Ok hun, nothing you can buy in a store will remove a tattoo. Buying chemicals to burn off your tattoo is dumb. You can have infections and other problems. <br>  <br>  If you don't like your tattoo find a good cover up artist and have it completely covered up with a new tattoo or have it re-worked to make it better. <br>  <br>  The other option is laser removal. Laser removal can cost thousands of dollars and take years to do. <br>  <br>  A tattoo is forever that's why you should take a lot of time and consideration into every tattoo.<br>  <br>  Also, any of those products such as Wrecking Balm does not work.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  It won't do any good trying to remove it that way. You'll most likely end up with an infection. Check out shops in your area. Some that do tattoo removal will work with you on payment plans.
Hymc2MAeaa	Fist off make sure your comfortable with yourself and what your wearing.<br>  <br>  Clothes:<br>  1) Tight fitting shirts, they show of your lovely curves.<br>   -take lose shorts and cut a peice out of the back, then pull it tighter and make it into a corset style, by taking a ribon through it. <br>  <br>  kind of like this: <a href="http://th03.deviantart.com/fs9/300W/i/2006/005/a/a/Corset_by_CoffinFairy.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://th03.deviantart.com/fs9/300W/i/20...</a><br>  <br>  2) Jeans that are fitting around the butt, just don't wear those skinny jeans, they are NOT attractive.<br>  <br>  3)Heals, strappy are very sexy, be sure to keep your toe nails clean and cute nicely, its simple and can be done at home.  But it can take some time to learn to walk in them if your not used to it.<br>  <br>  I didn't see the no shopping part till after i put everything in sorry.<br>  <br>  Other then clothes: i know you asked about clothes, but eyes have a huge effect on your appearance.  for me it's my strongest feature.  depending on your eye color is depending on what color eye shadow you should wear.  i'm not sure if you wear make-up or not so im going to put this down just as an FYI.  i can't tell you not to wear a lot of dark make-up because i think black or dark purples look AMAZING.  but bright colors are awful they take away from everything and make you look like a skank. if you like natural try copper tones they are very beautiful and flattering.  <br>  browns, purples, and blacks are very good at bring out eye colors.<br>  be careful with lipstick and gloss. im not good with judging it cuz i only wear chap-stick.<br>  <br>  but just make sure your comfy and don't let people's opinion take over.|`|5ecd52a3e38827f0b59290da8be919dcaa	Wet Seal, Victoria Secret|`|h7ZuUO0Zaa	push up bra<br>  !|`|HeOwMaxaaa	you can look sexy with tighter clothes hat show off wha you got...and some sexy make up like mascara and eyeliner with blush...but if you dont got the sexy attitude to go with it, it wont work. confidence = sexy|`|HE558QgXaa	wear something that makes you feel pretty.

W1aBjpRhaa	To them, most of those people don't want glasses plus sometimes if your older and don't have glasses it can make you look much younger, that's why they do it most of the time. For what the person wants and to make them look a lot younger than they are. But yes glasses can be very attractive. My boyfriend has them and he is still gorgeous as ever. And a lot of friends I have, also have them. They are still beautiful. Everyone has their own opinion though. Where those glasses girl, don't let them wear you [:|`|HCeCpPQfaa	Yea I know.. some people think they look better with contacts some just don't at all! Some look great with glasses but I understand if you change them because of sports.<br>  I personally don't think I could wear contacts.. I would be to afraid to put them in and take them out. Haha.<br>  I like the black rimmed squared ones I think they are. I don't have glasses but I am sure I need them. Ha.<br>  So yeaaaaaaaaa.|`|AA10207385	NO NO NO NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Oh my goodness! i love my glasses i switched from contacts to glasses for convenience also! I'm actually way more confident and feel prettier about my glasses! There is absolutely no need to switch to contacts!<br>  I think that people just have some stereotypical minds about us "4-eyed" people (LOL) I have some pretty blue frames too! so i think that as long as yoru eyeglasses fit you, and you feel good about yourself, you shouldn't care what people say, and if a guy is really into you, he will look behind the glasses.

UtGHiNXsaa	Genetic diversity gets really interesting, I knew somebody that had eyes that turn from brown to red(Its depended on the light, they once even turned yellow). Because I'm a variety/verity of nationality's my eyes and hair are multicolored my eyes are blue/dark blue with hazel pigment, depending on the light my eyes can look greenish.<br>  I like my hair but I have blonde highlights and tint, I ain't always happy with it because it sometimes looks too blonde.I also turn red and freckle(If I don't burn) Instead of tan. I was a little embarrassed once because I was the one with the lightest skin amoung a class of kids that had darker skin than I.(I live in Oklahoma)  <br>  <br>  All I know is that there is always something we are not going to like about are selves. Sometimes we just have learn how to be comfortable with ourselves. Won't you ask the people around you about your eyes.<br>  <br>  Contacts are always good if your wanting to change your look, But don't go to extremes, If you change one thing you might want to change another and the cycle goes on.Example Micheal Jackson(Do I have to say more)|`|9f3H3xSAaa	Because of their genes. Alot of latinos have brown eyes and alot of blonde people have blue or brown eyes. Its all in the genes buddy. And you can get colored contacts if you wanna make your eye color look different.|`|t3G5xSbIaa	u get it from ur parents, genetically passed on|`|1scwV5bJaa	lol its genes dude, u can't change ur color, stay urself..|`|BtK9nSalaa	people have different parents, so they get different genes<br>  <br>  answer mine plz? <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20090218175427AA8r6Ur">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/?qi...</a>|`|B24W8w43aa	Genetic diversity.<br>  Get some coloured contacts.|`|lvIPNDbgaa	Genetic variation only stops when a trait makes it harder for a species to survive. If everyone with blue eyes went blind before they turned 20, they would all die off and there would only be green, brown, and black eyes. However, since eye color does not effect reproductive success or survival, it is allowed to vary freely.<br>  <br>  You can't change your eye color permanently.|`|1thElV58aa	but the thing is some black people an get blue/green eyes. blonde hair with dark skin.

pus08YEOaa	At my Midwestern junior high, preps were all the kids who dressed in Abercrombie & Fitch, the boy and girl next door-looking types. The boys all had that stupid haircut where you cut it close, comb it forward and bleach the top, and spike the short ends. <br>  <br>  It didn't really have anything to do with behavior because you could be a drinker or flunkie as well as an honor roll type. It was just about clothes.|`|sV5URLZHaa	Technically the style prep isn't brand names and all that but the girl/boy next door, go to preperatory school and golf a the country club type. Think polo tees, plaid, khaki, sweater vest, headbands, and sweater around the shoulders.|`|qfSKgxDsaa	it's a rude sterotype; typically people that go to college prep schools...except they are very fortunate to be able to go there|`|hQA8Ql21aa	i don't believe in labels.|`|kvLWTTlhaa	Someone who comes from a well-known, old-money, New England family.

Dl9a08Rxaa	<a href="http://pioneerthinking.com/" rel="nofollow">http://pioneerthinking.com/</a><br>  its a great site for home remedies<br>  there are many different things for hair and skin and many other stuff|`|m0FmS9lqaa	This may sound odd but....<br>  ~*~ UNSCENTED KITTY LITTER!!! ~*~<br>  That's right, I said Kitty litter.<br>  Unscented kitty litter is made out of clay, Bentonite clay actually. Bentonite clay is extremely rich in minerals and comes from volcanic ash. After a volcano errupts, the ash settles and becomes clay! This clay is hydrofilling, which means that it's highly absorbant. Which means its like a magnet to the dirt and oil on your face! The clay is like a sponge and pulls away the dirt and oils from your face! Bentonite is mainly used in expensive facial creams for oily skin. This means that the expensive facial creams, are basically inexpensive versions of unscented kitty litter. How do you use it? This is how:<br>  1. Start with a fresh clean face! No makeup of moisturizers! Have unscented kitty litter ready, because scented kitty litter contains harsh chemicals to you skin! And never reuse the same kitty litter!<br>  2. Scoop 2 Tablespoons of clay into a bowl.<br>  3. Add water, enough to make the clay appear muddy and watery! The clay absorbs the water! it can hold 10x it's own weight!<br>  4. You can add oils or other ingredients to the clay, like aloe vera!<br>  5. Mis it up well, until the consistency is fine. It should look a little watery or muddy.<br>  6. Put it in the microwave for 20 seconds. But if your microwave is extremely strong, try 10 seconds, You just want the mask to be warm, not hot. You want it warm so it dialates your pores. The clay should look flat and muddy, but the water should be underneath it.<br>  7. Put the cclay water on your face, do not put the rocks on, the rocks can damage your face skin. Avoid the eye area! Use thin coats darling!<br>  Apply evenly!<br>  8. Wait till the clay is dry. It should begin to dry at 3 minutes, but will take a maximum of 15 minutes to dry completely. You shoudl feel you skin tightening! When the clay is dry, you should feel a tiny tingle!<br>  9. Use warm water, and gently rinse off! :D Towel dry, and use moisturizers!<br>  I hope this works for you as it has worked for me! :D|`|oE0ApHqPaa	I like this site for making body and face stuff, I would say about half of the things can be made with stuff you have in your kitchen:<br>  <a href="http://www.makeyourcosmetics.com/index.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.makeyourcosmetics.com/index.a...</a>
OHfZFR31aa	These are the main models used by Ralph Lauren<br>  <a href="http://supermodels.nl/brands/ralphlauren" rel="nofollow">http://supermodels.nl/brands/ralphlauren</a><br>  You can click on their names to see their profile and which agencies represent them. As you can see, they are all represented by top global agencies.<br>  <br>  So your first hurdle would actually be getting signed by one of these agencies - you need to be at least 5'8" with measurements around 34-24-34, have great skin and good features. Then once you are signed, you'd have to be lucky enough for Ralph Lauren to contact your agency and request models who meet your physical description. Even a big model like Lily Cole can't just decide she wants to work for Ralph Lauren if they aren't interested in her particular look|`|EW1yumzNaa	Well you arent old enough and there really picky about there models, i know cause i used to work for ralph lauren! and i got to go to runway shows and stuff. Ok well the girl below says your old enough, but they usually dont tak people younger than 18, and if they do its rare and you have to be super beautiful. Trust me and i also worked for Wilhelmina models as an intern, im in love with fashion|`|Bh259vTjaa	well, first off you have to get with a modeling agency. the shortest models are usually about 5'7'' and its hard for them to make it in the industry. so hopefully you're around 5'8'' and taller.<br>  you pretty much have to hope and pray that you're discovered or you need to go to NYC and go to Ford Modeling and talk with them.<br>  Do some research and see what you can get to happen for you :) <br>  Good luck|`|g902bCZIaa	you have to work your way up.<br>  start off creating a portfolio ($300)<br>  hire an agency, ford models is an excellent choice ($275 payments)<br>  start doing auditions ($75 gas) ($150 clothes to fit the part)<br>  being turned down over and over (priceless)<br>  ..just speak to your agency about aiming for that and try to find connections. create a good portfolio and mail it in.<br>  <br>  and generally models are 5'7 at the least.|`|hg5I1O2xaa	You need to be taller than 5'7" at the least. <br>  <br>  I'm not sure about the age thing. I mean there are models out there that are 13!!<br>  <br>  But you need to go to a modeling agency and then they book you the jobs. But it won't guarentee you Ralph Lauren.

eQQWdk0uaa	I wouldn't get much, but maybe two or three tiny stars placed around the text.  Stars for nighttime... dreaming.  Nice quote!  <br>  <br>  None of mine are on the rib, so I can't help with that part, sorry!  Good luck with ideas.|`|8THz1sp9aa	I would just get the text. Placing images around text really looks cluttered and terrible. Maybe just get the quote and later on if you ever figure out something that flows with the piece add to it. Or even better you could go to your artist and talk to them about ideas. Artists come up with really creative & amazing pieces! good luck|`|pqlhPnexaa	The beauty of the tattoo you posted is its simplicity in the text. With the location considered, I would really go with just the text. Pick out a nice font that you like, and go for it.<br>  <br>  While the pain will be worse then it would be in a different area, just remember that it is a temporary pain, but the gorgeous art will be on your body forever.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|0X7DWnyeaa	My boyfriend has a rib tattoo. He says it hurts a lot! If you've ever gotten a tittie twister it feels like that times ten! I have a tattoo that goes close to my ribs and those spots were the worst getting tattooed. I like your quote. I agree that the scenery should be light and airy. Clouds, sky, maybe birds. Something soft. I would suggest maybe doing the text in a blue to flow with the scenery. I think that with the harsh black it would be too bold and not very girly.|`|JfOuzOJGaa	Going with the content of the quote, you could get dreamy imagery such as clouds, stars, swirls, smoke, etc.

I curl my lashes and always put on my mascara first, cos I sometimes get it on my eye lid and things, so putting it on first, I can remove it without taking off anything else, like eye shadow.<br>  <br>  2. For this part, I have a palette of brown eye shadows(light medium and dark). I sweep the light brown(kind of beige/"dirty white"/very light brown) all over my eye lid. Then with the dark brown, I start at the outer corner of my eyelid and bring it in about half way on my eye lid. You can make it as dark as you like, bring it up as high as you like or as far into the eye lid as you like. Experiment =] What I do is I literally line my upper lid right by the lash line, quite dark to emphasize it lol.<br>  <br>  3. You do the same thing just under your lash line on your lower lid, literally lining it, halfway along the "lid"(I don't actually know if you have a lower eye lid lol). You can once again experiment with amount of shadow, darkness, length of the line and thickness of it. All that.<br>  <br>  4. What I do then is line my entire water line with black eyeliner, but as it makes your eyes look smaller, maybe don't line them at all, or with white eye liner. I've never ever tried white liner, so I have noooo idea what it's like lol. I just heard it makes your eye bigger, so maybe you could try it.<br>  <br>  5. Then I look in the mirror and make sure it looks just like I want it to. For applying the eye shadow, you can use a blending brush or little applicator sponge. Doesn't really matter :D<br>  <br>   Other thing you could try is lining your upper lash line with eye liner (liquid or pencil, and if you do pencil you could maybe smudge it to give you that sexy/sultry/smokey eyed look), more thick on the outside, becoming a thin to nothing line the closer you get to your inner corner, and once again the same on the lower lash line.<br>  <br>  That's all I can tell you, I hope it's enough and works out well, and at the same time, I hope I didn't write so much you gave up halfway lol.<br>  <br>  I bet you're a beautiful girl and are just as stunning as your friend =]<br>  <br>  Remember, make-up is there to emphasize and bring out your beauty, not to hide it ;)<br>  <br>  I hope you have fun, try out different things and see what works best for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!

They cling to the body so if you are fit--that's what will be shown. If not--well --then that is what will be seen...select black ones ...you can also get some with a spandex/lycra content and a bit of a sheen to them...very flattering. <br>  <br>  Sounds like you have a nice body so you'll look great.^^|`|k9IFYBDQaa	leotards are real cute. good colors are pink, red and black. i think you will have a hard time not impressing your crush.|`|zwvDITr5aa	I wear them all the time, pink is my fave.

e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	Here are some basic tips for curly hair that you might find helpful:<br>  *Try to find a stylist who knows how to work with curly hair. You can find reviews by region here: <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons</a><br>  *Don't shampoo every day.<br>  *Comb conditioner through hair in the shower.<br>  *Apply styling products to dripping wet hair. Scrunch or twirl hair to achieve desired shape.<br>  *Use styling products suited for your hair type. Don’t know yours? <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types</a><br>  *Avoid terrycloth towels on hair; use linen, paper towels, or t-shirts instead.<br>  *Air dry or use a diffuser with your blowdryer.<br>  *Don't touch (or brush!) your hair while it’s drying.<br>  *Once completely dry scrunch out any crunchy texture.<br>  <br>  For hair type specific products check out these forums:<br>  <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/</a><br>  There you can find others with the same hair type and try out some of their favorite products. I would recommend something, but I don’t know your hair type. :)<br>  <br>  Lastly, it has made my hair so much better since I started the curly girl method! I used to almost never wear it down (it was a frizz/poof ball), but now I have pretty, shiny curls. ~:) It’s pretty radical—no sulfates (shampoo) or silicones—but it’s so great for curly hair.

Au4gWgEiaa	Nah!  Hollow needles are the way to go!  It will be sore, and feel warm for the first day or two.  The first week it will be very sore so try not to bump it!!  <br>  <br>  Needles are less damaging than guns are.  The guns use a blunt force that can shatter cartilage, as well as guns are harder to clean properly and always have a risk of infection from it.  Needles are single use!  They slide right through, you'll feel it for a moment but it is over before you know it!  <br>  <br>  As a side note, I found getting my cartilage done with a needle hurt less than getting my lobes done with a gun... Even my industrial was a better experience than my lobes ever were!|`|loqsl5xXaa	yes it will be painful. it is quick and there is a little stinging after than nothing. it will be sore after but nothing u wont be able to handle. just remember don't move your earing after you get it done and dont twist the ball. make sure you clean it like they say. it is much cleaner. everything came out of a presealed individual wrapper (i used the needle). For me i cant do the whole counting thing, I just say say ok and do it do not count! you will be fine. the anticipation for it is much worse than the poke for the ears anyways. I know the other part of your body is different. also you cant think to much about it, lol you will psych yourself out.|`|vczkaWiXaa	I had the gun, it hurts way more than a lobe piercing, and its uncomfortable afterwords to sleep on that side of the head, but it looks wicked so...<br>  You can also try a lotion such as emla to numb the area before the piercing.  Parents use it before piercing their kids ears. Or any other lotion with lidocaine should work.|`|40dUfARwaa	the gun hurts more than the needle especially in the cartilage because you have the chance of shattering your cartilage<br>  <br>  the needle processe takes longer but is safer and doesnt hurt as much<br>  <br>  piercing parlors are magnificent and you will probably have a great experiance:)|`|EXKyCtWAaa	Cartilage piercings hurt more than lobes but not by much. It really depends on your pain tolerance. <br>  <br>  I always had the gun and it was like about a second of pain for me and it was done really fast. I've had my cartilage pierced three times and it didn't hurt much.|`|Wchi6Xd4aa	All piercings hurt. I have both my cartilages done. 1 with a gun and 1 at a piercing place. The gun hurt more than with the needle...and the needle is a little slower cuz they have to pierce it, then put the ring in it...<br>  <br>  <br>  dont be too worried. you'll be fine! :]

Cetaphil has 2 types of alcohol in it (very drying) and also has sodium lauryl sulfate and has parabens in it as well. both are really bad for your skin :(. do some research on those ingredients.. you'll be throwing away a lot of products lol.|`|jyOUUqkFaa	if you appy it in the morning, morning burst in citrus, its gentle and it smells goood. if you apply it at night, try the nutragena wave. it cleans your skin really well but it doesnt have anything strong in it that'll hurt your face.|`|FV0BoSkTaa	Olay has one for sensitive skin that's amazing.|`|m8ygETYZaa	If you are using prescribed acne creams, you need a complete cleansing regimen, such as cleanser, toner and moisturizer.

DzLX1ophaa	you want to try the mediun setting when your hair is damp. When your hair is 70% dry you want to divide it in sections, and here's where it gets tricky: You start with a section, with high, hot air, when it looks the way you want it to (still using your round brush) you are going to switch to cold air for a few seconds, and that is going to set the style (for instance if you're flipping the ends), your hair is going to feel softer and your style will last longer, good luck!|`|tWePoJYNaa	My stylist told me that using cold after you blow dry your hair with hot will set your hair and make it shinier. It won't lose its shape as easily if you do that. <br>  <br>  It's always better to blow dry your hair with less heat, but I use as hot as it can go to dry my hair faster.|`|aZxbMKRCaa	when it is wet, start it off with hot, then use medium (warm) to dry the rest of it.<br>  cold is normally used to set the hair.<br>  eg fringe ( when styling)<br>  just try them out, you will soon find out which is best for your hair|`|m0FmS9lqaa	Temperature:<br>  Hot -- hot can dry your hair faster then cold.<br>  Warm -- dries fast, but not as fast as hot.<br>  Cold -- I've heard that cold water and air makes your hair shiny. Won't dry fast, but seems to be a little more healthier for your hair.<br>  <br>  Speed:<br>  Fast -- fast will usually dry your hair out, and make it seem dry and fried.<br>  Medium -- won't dry your hair out but may make your hair seem dry.<br>  Slow -- Best for your hair. Will not dry your hair out.<br>  <br>  *~*~* My suggestion is if you sue products in your hair, you should use the HOT AND LOW setting. It won't blow the product away and should heat the product in.|`|uAzToWC7aa	hot makes your hair dry(try spraying on some heat protection spray)<br>  cold makes your hair shinier<br>  warm-is in the middle of the two<br>  <br>  on long, straightish hair, go for the cold, that's what i do, and it comes out GGGRRREEEAAATTT!!!!!!!

So use a moisturizing shampoo & conditioner. Umm, warm is ok but it will take longer to dry and cold doesn't do ANYTHING!! It will take hours to blow your hair dry. High, medium and low are the same as hot warm and cold.|`|dBS6a7nXaa	The temperature and power doesn't really effect your hair. It depends on HOW you blow your hair. I have long, straight hair as well and I use Hot and High just to make it faster, but blowing your hair too much isn't good for your hair either. It makes it frizzy.|`|reh7xuNlaa	I personally like to use med cold. It does not make my hair as frizzy.. But it depends on the shape your hair is in.  :)

U04kk0hzaa	well it looks like you have a cowlick at the top of your hairline. this will interfere with any kind of bang you want. it can be very hard to train your hair to lay flat with that kind of a growth pattern. i don't suggest it unless you keep them very long and blow dry your hair with product every day.|`|x8TAxOHbaa	part your hair the way you want it to the side you want your bangs if the hair won't stay in place you can tame your hair. To tame your hair pin the hair down before you go to bed do this for a couple of days until you see that it's becoming tamed.|`|164d21ed8ebea68c695ae00635cca015aa	just part your hair on the side- i dont like middle parts on anyone, its not flattering for any face shape|`|xqrwDmyUaa	Honestly I have no idea lol, I had the same problem so I just went to a hairdresser and had them do it and then show me how, glad I did too because i was screwing it up royally.

The only thing you can do is have someone else look at it and check to see if it went into your skin.   I don't mean to upset you but if it is stuck inside the skin you will have to go to a doctor (which is what i did) and they will have to make a tiny cut and get it out.  It doesn't hurt cause they numb it!   I do have a small scar on the back of my ears from the cut lol i'll never do that again.  Good luck I hope you can get it out.

I know this sounds crazy, but if you have pliers or tongs or something of that kind, grab them and pull it out from the back. If that doesn't work, do the same but from the front. Yes, there may be blood so be extra careful. If not, I know you said not to say it, but ask someone with you to do the same procedure. I hope it helps!

7XSMjgroaa	Well, first, you should get at least 8 hours of sleep if possible depending on your schedule. Also, what you can do to help get rid of puffiness or bags under the eyes, is take 2 metal spoons, put them in the freezer for about 3 or 4 minutes and put them over your eyes for about 5 minutes.

DpStw8RBaa	You could get it on your outer thigh that way it will be concealed. Maybe your shoulder blade or your lower back, off to one side?|`|NhOQ3mRxaa	The leg that is where I am getting mine, You can hide it easily! but why a pig?|`|pqlhPnexaa	Cool tattoo idea!<br>  <br>  If you get it somewhere on your back, it will be fairly easy to cover it up when you have to. Some places on your back include lower back (common, but also has some not so pleasant connotations), shoulder blade (pretty, but depending on how skinny you are, maybe not the most flattering spot), or back of the neck (i really like this spot, it's easy to cover with hair or whatever, but also easy to display). However, the back means you won't be able to see it yourself.<br>  <br>  If you got it on your ankle/foot, that could also be a possibility. And if you want it more private, somewhere like your chest could be an option.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your tattoo!!!|`|AA11611389	Where ever it will hurt the least when you go to have it removed in 10 years.|`|5b820805b9932bc37844045b822eddbeaa	On the lower back.<br>  <br>  That would be nice.|`|so95ktlIaa	shoulder blade|`|AA11337952	The hip is a pretty popular spot for tattoos.

tluojTpSaa	there is this awesome braid, i dont know if i can explain it with no pictures!<br>    It is a french braid that i very small along the top and side of your head.  It looks like you have a hair headband.  <br>  I'll try to explain:<br>   first, part your hair way, way over to one side.<br>   second, start the braid at that part, picking up small sections as you go, just like you would in a french braid.<br>   third, make sure it goes all the way under your hair so you cant see the ends.  You can then do a small one on the other side and use a tie to hook them together under your hair.<br>  It looks great!<br>  PS  I havent used a blowdryer for about 8 years...or any styling product.  my hair is still damaged.  regular trims are all you can do.  I dont think heat is that big of a thing.  So straighten those luscious locks!!!
cNZAO5BRaa	It's detailed and easy to follow- if I need to do my eyes like that for a special occasion, I'm so revisiting your tutorial.<br>  <br>  You do get a little flustered here and there, but it doesn't detract from the tutorial or anything. I like it!

Email me for more.|`|wRsSodTAaa	My mom just got out of a cast on her arm and they have many colors.  For a working girl, maybe black would be good.  But if you have a casual type of job, you could get a color.
nQdTKnzVaa	I have always wondered this as well...<br>  <br>  I think it is mostly clothing (skinny jeans, random tshirts, plaid shirts, cardigans, etc). But it is also a lot about music (usually from bands you have never heard of). They like to drink coffee and write poems and paint...i dunno stuff like that
BWYhw5EZaa	i use this stuff sometimes. what i would do is go take a shower if you are woried it will turn out orange. scrub all the areas you put the lotion on.<br>  <br>  for next time, when you use it... i always mix the glow lotion with another plain lotion (about half regular & half glow lotion) it seems to work just right, without being too orange.|`|U8VGvgC1aa	No, it won't make you orange, I use it all the time. A few times a week at least. Same color. And if I'm going out or something I might add 2 or 3 applications just for some extra color. But it has never made me orange. Wash your hands and scrub your nails though.

I exfoliate with both a mechanical exfoliator (a scrub basically, I like Aveeno daily scrub) in the morning and in the evening I use a chemical exfoliator (which is considered better, in this case a product containing salicylic acid, if you have oily skin or Lactic acid for dry skin) I have oily skin so I use Neutrogena 3 in 1 acne stress gel and once a week I use the clean and clear blackhead eraser ( i am not sure it helps but it makes my face feel nice lol).<br>  I also own a blackhead extractor, it's a metal stick with a loop on each end, you use this to press out the  blackheads, it's kinda gross but it works. I don't need to use it much anymore because the other stuff I use keeps the blackheads from coming back after the first time I used the extractor.<br>  Do not steam your face, I thought I would mention this in case someone recommends it. It's bad for your skin and can cause vericose veins, I used to steam and now I have these disgusting veins around my nose from it, I didn't find out until it was too late what was causing it.<br>  Ok well that's all I got, good luck.|`|df805281ce1bc1c7c3de30c04dbcb458aa	Use Biore strips, you can buy them worldwide.

The one i was looking at (and the one that got the best reviews) was the Braun Silk-epil Xpressive 7681, it's cool because it comes with a little attachment head that is just for smaller areas like underarms or bikini line.

Benefit makeup always does something weird to my skin- I love how it looks on other girls, but it just never seems to work for me.<br>  <br>  (But their BadGalLash in black does wonders for my eyes.)<br>  <br>  Use Philosophy's 'Hope in a Jar for Sensitive Skin' moisturizer all over your face (or another good-quality moisturizer), and throughout the day, apply clear ChapStick on the scaly parts (just rub it over the scaly parts) to diminish the appearance of the lizardy, scaly skin.<br>  <br>  The moisturizer will help with the redness; the ChapStick will eliminate a LOT of the scaliness.<br>  <br>  Oh, and if you want to cover it up with makeup, use a liquid foundation: avoid cream, cream-to-powder, and especially powder makeup until the skin is back to normal.

gHT2ZPkFaa	Getting a good foundation is key. I personally like Jane Iredale or Cover FX. Cover FX also has good bronzer in different undertones for different skin colors. Everybody is different and it would be wise to visit a store like sephora so you can test different formulas before you buy. I personally think Urban Decay eyeshadows are the best. They have a wide color range and you can use them dry for a sheer color or wet for a dramatic effect. MAC makes some of the smoothest eyeliners available, but things like mascara, eyeliner, and lipgloss really dont need to be expensive brands. Neutrogena and loreal make good mascara and maybeline shine seduction is a really good gloss.  <br>  <br>  You should find a cleaser that suits your skin type. If you have sensitive skin youll need fragrance and dye free formulas. If your looking for anti aging products look for alpha hydroxy acids and glycolic acid in your products. Again Sephora or Ulta has one of the best selection. Use a thick night creme like Philosophys "When hope is not enough" or you can use grapeseed oil found at GNC.  and during the day try a simple moisturizer with an spf 30 like neutrogena. <br>  <br>  For your hair use a smooting creme while your hair is still wet. Let your hair air dry and then straighten it. When your done apply an anti frizz shine serum. Garnier and John Freida are good drugstore brands or Frederik Fekkai has a whole glossing system that would work. You should also use a ceramic straightener too.|`|vg9C2TqQaa	for makeup, definitely MAC. if you go to the store, or even macys, they can match your makeup to your skin tone. if its too pricey, go to sephora and they may have some high quality things slightly cheaper. i would definitely invest in a new straightener. the red, ionic, Conair steam iron is VERY good. as for hair product, bumble and bumble is your best bet.|`|RcBkUBsfaa	powder foundation :mac studio fix<br>  <br>  liquid foundation : revlon colorstay<br>  <br>  lipgloss: mac lipglass or victoria secret lipglosses<br>  <br>  eyeshadows: mac or h.i.p<br>  <br>  mascara: cover girl volume exact mascara<br>  <br>  shampoo: biolage|`|k76zo3L1aa	i suggest you to use l'oreal from paris.|`|ZyV2InIPaa	for makeup MAC is the best brand. a little bit pricey but worth it. and they don't test on animals :)<br>  <br>  as for hair, i like bed head tigi or catwalk. again pricey. but high quality.<br>  <br>  if i were you i would invest in a new straightener. <br>  make sure you use a thermal protectant, as well|`|YtAkmjoyaa	lip gloss= COBigelow (get at Bath&BodyWorks)<br>  eye make up= Mac<br>  blush/foundation = Bare Escentuals<br>  hair products = Joico<br>  moisturizers= depends on your skin<br>  <br>  well for your hair how you describe, try getting those herstylers, they work great and invest in a product that keeps it straight, like straight hair activator sprays, TRESemme(thermal creations) got a pretty good one.

dxeb0BfBaa	When I was learning to braid & weave I bought Marquetta Breslin's 4-in-1 DVD & her Cornrow Compilation DVD. The lighting & camera positions were excellent & it was very well made & professional but I found that you had to have some basic knowledge of how to braid. Also I notice that a lot of things I take for granted & just do automatically when braiding were not included in the DVDs & when I loaned the DVDs to a few of my friends & relatives (1 of them a hairstylist) they were completely lost when they tried to follow the DVD. Another problem I find is if you don't have a VERY strong natural flair for african hair styling & a VERY strong interest the advice in the video would be falling on deaf ears. In a way the DVDs are quite advanced & you would need to learn the basics before you learn from them. I had already taught myself to braid before I bought the DVDs so they just helped me learn more about braiding & certain tips that did help a lot. I had the DVDs sent to me in Ireland by regular mail. I think you should try looking for videos on <a href="http://www.youtube.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com</a> before you buy the DVDs. Youtube has A LOT of videos on all sorts of braiding & weaving. I would advise that once you have a basic grasp of braiding or as you are getting a grasp of braiding you watch the DVDs to make sure you are not doing anything that might harm your clients hair such as too much tension at the root. They did help me build my standard up to a professional level but hard work, patience & dedication is the main thing to help you build your standards. Also it can take years to be able to do things like micro braids within 1 day. My 1st head of micros took me 2days, now I usually do it in under 5hrs. Hope I helped!

I didn't care if people were jealous of me and i didn't care if boys looked at me. because i am capable of self-validation. i know that i am worthy and valuable with out having to hear it from someone else.<br>  you need to learn how to not care about what other people think about you or you're going to miserable for the rest of your life.<br>  just because you're 14 and your life is all cushy and it hasn't REQUIRED you to grow up doesn't mean that you shouldn't.|`|FV0BoSkTaa	The same thing happened to me, only my hair started off really short, so they had to cut it even shorter.

Good luck dear.|`|U04kk0hzaa	if protein treatments and moisturizing treatments don't work then you will have to wait for it to grow back.  try getting your hair glazed a natural color (not permanent color) until it is healthier. this will give it some shine and keep it from being too porous. try to keep heat styling to a minimum.|`|HOynqaVuaa	Oooh....

My hair was bleached out and it felt AWFUL! to make you feel better i will tell you how i got my hair (mine had to be cut SHORT also__the attention was annoying for me too) silky again.<br>  <br>  Try Hydralicious by HERBAL ESSENCE every 3 days, your hair has natural oils that will repair your hair but washing everyday will wash them out, wash your hair when it starts to smell or get nappy. Use the shampoo and conditioner. Try not to use too much shampoo but use a handful of conditioner. Let it soak for about 5 minutes in your scalp.<br>  <br>  after you get out of the shower DO NOT COMB YOUR HAIR. when it is brittle it can break and when its wet its worse. While your hair is still wet put In(fus)ium throughout your hair(use the REPAIR formula) leave your hair alone until it dries then slowly comb it out with a bursh.  a paddle bursh might work better its easier on your already brittle strands. After it only takes a month or two to get it healthy looking again.<br>  <br>  My hair is growing back and reaches the nape of my neck (mine was shaven T-T) but it feels so nice and healthy. As an added tip after the first month your hair will grow atleast 1/2 an inch...cut this off. <br>  <br>  Hope you get your hair healthy again<br>  <br>  -Aly <3

I think full bangs that go straight across can be really cute and fun, but they don't work for everyone and they're a little fussier to maintain (plus you might break out across your forehead).<br>  I'd say side-swept bangs are more versatile and generally work for most girls. Plus, they're way easier to maintain and to grow out once you want to go for another look.|`|pmMPjdo0aa	If you are looking for something cute then going down is. Side bangs give off a more mature look -not serious though- The problem with straight bangs are that they dont last very long unless you cut your hair VERY often.

DzLX1ophaa	If you're a guy, any moisturizing conditioner will work, really, guy's hair is much less damaged than ours (unless you color it), But There's this good brand they sell for guys at salons called American Crew, it is a little expensive, but if you really feel you need something good you'll love those products.|`|51f7d0ee07bcbaea13dc55784aea7f62aa	If you are heterosexual, none.|`|m0FmS9lqaa	For guys if you don't want a flowery scent, don't go with Herbal Essences.

loqsl5xXaa	the 2 before me have the right info, but dont use the first aide stuff!! also you can use saline solution as well. just make sure after u clean it to rinse with cool to luke warm water.|`|pqlhPnexaa	For aftercare: I wouldn't use a bar, so definitely go with either liquid or foam. Clean it twice a day, using room temperature water and being very careful not to tug at the piercing. I don't think the antiseptic spray is necessary: it will probably just irritate the new piercing.<br>  <br>  One other thing you should do for aftercare is to use salt water- gently rinse it with this once a day.<br>  <br>  As for the passing out: had you eaten anything prior to getting pierced? If you didn't eat anything, you could have just gotten faint from low blood sugar combined with the piercing. I know it's quite common with people who are getting tattooed.<br>  <br>  I hope you love your piercing and everything.... congrats!|`|2Q3VkEfTaa	i've never passed out after a piercing, and i have my navel pierced four times. uhm dial is the best, do not get the bar...its hard to use. i actually have the foaming action one, its great because you can actually tell that its covering the piercing. use that twice a day. <br>  the walgreens one will work just the same, but i just prefer dial. <br>  also, i use a sea salt soak once a day, usually before i go to sleep, i just take a shot glass of warm water and add some SEA SALT to it, it really does wonders. <br>  do this for about 6 weeks, or until it is fully healed.
loqsl5xXaa	nope been there, lol.. it was like a yr after though.. it didnt do anything i though it would too.. it just bleed a little and was sore. i put vitamin E on it to help heal it and so it wouldnt leave any scar tissue or bumps and it was just fine.|`|uJ9waJDYaa	How long have you had the tattoo?<br>  If it's only been like two month keep an eye on it and keep it clean and if there are problems with it healing call the place you got it from.<br>  If you have had it for a while and its a small cut it should heal fine.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|VxbdjKIKaa	It won't do any harm unless you cut it too deep or you keep cutting it over and over again on the same general area. I wouldn't be too worried it shouldn't be bad. Be careful next time though.|`|qe3NQIwgaa	not unless its deep or same spot over and over again..<br>  <br>  the ink is embedded deep in your skin. and every tattoo should be touched up eventually.|`|reh7xuNlaa	How long have you had it? If you have had it long enough to be shaving on top of it then you should be fine. If not then you prob need a touch up ;O|`|0X7DWnyeaa	It can hurt a bit. Tattoo ink goes several layers deep into your skin. It wouldn't hurt the tattoo at all. No worries :)|`|BcWs38MWaa	how smart can these girls be we all kno a cut hurts duhhh but i dont think a simple razor cut can do much damage|`|Gh6ep5O7aa	no, but if you cut your leg it will hurt ; (|`|8IfePMa3aa	It'll be fine. The ink is very deep within the skin, you'd have to have a really nice gash before it would affect the tattoo.|`|hd442Ha5aa	It's generally advised to wait till the tattoo finishes healing. After that the only harm it could do is hurt you a lot! like any other razor cut and possibly scar the tissue on the tattoo if it is deep enough.|`|VjkDIvezaa	if it is a stick on one yeah. if it is a real one , no a little cut won't do anything. if it requires stitched then maybe|`|NhOQ3mRxaa	unless it is some huuuuuge gash then it's ok!<br>  Chelsei!|`|2yVbbs1faa	It will hurt. :-(
Nag5zGD1aa	JC Penny's and Kohl's.|`|10ZfhkDZaa	i had the same problem. go to debs its a great store with fashionable cloths both pants and tee-shirts. they have regular and colored skinny Jeans there is a plus size and a regular section and to tell you the truth the plus Selection is the same and the normal well i hope that i helped you|`|9HGOxPoEaa	Stitches :) <br>  they have bongo jeans. <br>  They have a size 12 skinny jeans. <br>  Their sizes seem to run bigger though so you might need a smaller size :)|`|C1QXdLtmaa	i've seen some at target. you should check there. they're pretty cute & low rise also. i'm sure they'll have your size. :)|`|EeQ6qL52aa	GapKids|`|RMq1cKBNaa	abercrombie kids...i had the same problem.
mRgRDhMQaa	im pretty sure in the video she has like a smokey eye. <br>  <br>  1.put a concealer or face powder lightly over your eyelids. <br>  *(this helps with the make-up staying on your lids)<br>  <br>  2. put black eyeliner on your eyelash line and on the bottom of your eye. <br>  <br>  3. take a dark brown or black and blend it and make your you get it in good on the crease of your eye. <br>  <br>  4. take brown eyeliner and put it on your eyelid and smudge it a little bit. <br>  <br>  5. add a light brown and then add white near the eyebrow and blend in for a smokey eye. <br>  <br>  6. curl lashes and put on mascara. <br>  <br>  some good tips is if you go on youtube and type in taylor swift make-up or make-up tutorials or smokey eye tutorial! thats where I go to learn how to put on make-up better and learn new things.|`|uKCeyiizaa	Line the bottom of her eyes with grey eyeliner and line the tops with black. Then put a white/silver eyeshadow on your whole eyelid all the way up to your brow and put a darker silver on your eyelid to just above your crease. Then dab a little silver eyeshadow under your eyes. Finish the look with alot of dark mascara.

Mac is by far the best, but is about 20 bucks, it lasts, clinique is a little cheaper at like 17, but if you need less than that neutrogena is the way all my friends go when they buy drug stores brands. Works great. Also consider your skin type, powder is good for oily skin, if thats all you are using.|`|B2vFQLU0aa	I like bare minerals or a cheaper one is mineral power its at any local store and is around $10.|`|welQ5nSqaa	Mac!

BoVneri7aa	If you bleach it, then it has no pigments left. Then if you dye it "red" its going to be pink. Ever seen a blonde dye her hair red? Its a bad sight. Any who, I would suggest against it. The best way is to gradually add highlights of red and blonde into your current hair color so that your entire head doesn't lose pigment at once. Over a few months, you should get the color you want. FYI- Bleaching is always a bad idea at home, it cannot be corrected.|`|UPtSo7Cyaa	I don't know how to help, but just go to a better salon!|`|aTMcV6PFaa	Can't really tell you how to do it, because I don't know the condition of your hair.

Or just get a cute wig!!! It won't ever fade.|`|uHI1G3o4aa	I suggest going to a salon..

aTMcV6PFaa	I would NOT wash or condition hair atleast a day or two before getting a relaxer. But after you get it I would definately recommend it.  Your hair will be dry from the chemicals in the relaxer and it will really need it. I would leave it on for atleast 30 minutes with a shower cap to keep in the heat. Good luck sweetie!!

JlyYRBCIaa	first of all, all hair is dead. it sounds like your hair is overprocessed. you need to get regular hair cuts and use a heat protectant on it, of use a lesser amount of heat on your hair. mainly if you get regular trim-ups your hair will look 100X better :)|`|UQhn8hfmaa	<a href="http://www.organicrootstimulator.com/products/mayo.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.organicrootstimulator.com/pro...</a><br>  <br>  Good stuff for removing dead hair,|`|reh7xuNlaa	No thinning your hair will actually make your hair worse. :( You need to just trim your hair every friday untill it is healthy again.

The second is too fake and plastic-e. The first is fresh and has personality.<br>  <br>  EDIT I do agree with shoei though. A pic would help because I think that every style can look good if pulled off but you have to dress your color tones and body structure to really make your look flawless and fluid on you. So on you maybe two would be better, but I like the character of one best.<br>  <br>  EDIT The one with the cat in the back is hysterical! You are quite funny. Honestly though, I think the green would look best on you (with the assumption that under your wig you have dark hair) but I would definitely wear thick black tights or dark jeans. I can't tell whether the green warmers are leg or arm but they would go well over the tights. And a green cardigan in a shorter style. Cheerio.|`|09d93f5a172f885934a7cc1ccfcc61b0aa	haha..that's awesome. Not so much what I would wear but hell, that would be interesting though.

NB1cbRm0aa	yes go to the beauty stor (not cvs or anything like that) and buy the color you want, (not the ready made box kits that come with everything). the color should be in one single tube, then buy a bottle of 40peroxide with it and mix both of them according to directions on how to use it.<br>  <br>  you might have to color it more than once to achieve the exact color<br>  and make sure your hair is natural black, it doesn't work on dyed black hair =) good luck<br>  <br>  <br>  on top of that you can put lemon juice & go out in the sun with itin your hair...also condition your hair with cinnamon.<br>  <br>  here: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2146927_lighten-hair-cinnamon.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_2146927_lighten-...</a><br>  <br>  & <br>  <br>  <a href="http://hmbeautyrecipes.homestead.com/HAIRcolorlighteners.html" rel="nofollow">http://hmbeautyrecipes.homestead.com/HAI...</a>|`|AQHFUPSPaa	You mean you wanted a highlight?

I forgot my hair straightener on a trip and ran into target to get one and i just grabbed the most expensive, which happened to be a conair, its white and comes with a silver case and pad (to lay it on, dont want to start any fires) but it works great and has a half inch plate, which is what you want since you  have shorter hair. i also have really thick hair but it works so good, its like a hundred dollars now, and i also saw it at marshalls for really cheap, also matching curler and blow dryer. good luck!|`|c40ROtHEaa	i just bought a chi on ebay for $50! it works GREAT. i was nervous at first about buying something that expensive on ebay, but it had insurance on it, and my sister has boughten things off of there before so i tried it. just go and look, there are some awesome deals! (by the way, the def. are the best straighteners out there!)|`|wb5YTkbvaa	HAI. that is the BEST. All the hairdressers I talk to recommend that brand. Thats why I bought mine, and I Love it.  Its black with blue ceramic.|`|1EB7fbxpaa	The Chi. My hair is so soft and super straight after using it.It doesn't damage your hair as bad as those other straighteners..
D2VJP1ADaa	If you have a brother that is also using it to beat off with then they might be trying to hide the fact that they are also using your lotion for that purpose by adding water to it.<br>  <br>  You should talk to your brother and tell him that if he wants to beat off, to get his own lotion.|`|164d21ed8ebea68c695ae00635cca015aa	its melted, and you cant fix melted lotion, sorry..:(|`|c6zymHmTaa	lol vaseline lol

cNZAO5BRaa	FANTASTIC PRODUCT. I would definitely recommend you switch from those noxious benzoyl peroxide products to Purity. It does a good job clearing out your pores, and it works its acne-healing magic in about three weeks after you start using it daily. You won't notice results immediately but if you stick with it, it will do wonders for your skin.<br>  <br>  However- follow it with a good moisturizer. It does tend to make your face feel stretched too tautly (but never dry). I recommend Philosophy's Hope in a Jar moisturizer- it's never, ever greasy and it soothes your skin sooooo much.<br>  <br>  Philosophy's Purity cleanser is really, really great, and I totally recommend it to you. I too had moderate acne and skin that was overly irritated and dried by other acne washes, but my morning routine of Purity and Hope in a Jar has really fixed all that.<br>  <br>  Oh- and there are two versions of Purity, a high-foaming, water-based version and a creamier, slightly more gel-like version. I use the latter, but I'm sure the former version works just as well.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA12133586	yep my favorite cleanser. another product i would recomend is clarisonic brush... tips- dont use an alcohol base toner since it can cause more acne|`|4381ce1eabe1bba2f5000ef04b6611caaa	Purity is the absolute best cleanser to use if you are just cleansing skin, but it doesn't work especially well with acne removal. It helps prevent a little, because you have cleaner skin, but I would not recommend it for acne prevention. You might want to go to a dermatologist to see what kind of acne prevention cream is light and will work on your skin:)<br>  Get purity though, it lasts a long time, and your face feels so great after using it!

I am also watching what I eat.|`|AA10253403	If you had a picture, I'd make a comment.  Maybe you are fat... maybe you have annorexia.  Either way, you need either a personal trainer or a psychiatrist.  I'd recommend going to your local gym, and asking a trainer what he thinks.  If he thinks you need to shed some weight, then you can rest assured you don't need mental help, and simply need to get on an elliptical.  If however, he looks at you and tells you that you are fine, then go get help fast before it becomes something threating your physical health.

I too have tried the "straightener" thing.  Seems the stylists always manage to straighten it, but it takes them an hour to do so.  Have you tried using the round brush while drying it?  YOu can use this when it is wet and work it with the hair wrapped around the rounded part rolled under it, hair wrapped downward...and constantly blowing hot air on it...takes a long time though.  That is one way.  <br>  <br>  You have a mullet though, that is the problem.  Your hair is not going to grow straight if you have layers.  I know this for a fact.  So my dear you are going to have to suffer through and grow out the layer on top.  Yep, well hey if you want a mullet then you aren't going to get the straight hair okay?  Mullet and thick STRAIGHT hair...umm..there is no such thing i hate to tell you.  If you have seen someone with this style...well i haven't is all i can say.  I have seen mullets with thinner hair not THICK.  Mullets with permmed frizzy thick hair yes and ewwwwwwwww..don't do that either.  <br>  <br>  Basically grow out your layers it is the only way to getting any sort of straight hair.  TRUST me on this.  hey i had to suffer through it too.  like i said if you don't want to suffer through it then you simply have to deal with the fact you got a thick mullet okay that isn't going to be straight.|`|1f95fec55f6996e5b84f7ba7eab0383daa	go to the hair dresser and get your hair thined|`|5539eb77356d189b5a55c1fb8947adf5aa	go see  a specialist girl who know about the lenghth of hair, u know aNybody?|`|d0fad5f6cb3516e9443cc69e41849eeeaa	go to a beauty shop and get straightening gel and use the CHI iron. it worked for me, and i have the same prob you do.|`|oI9JbxiMaa	Perhaps you would like to invest in a permanent straightening session at the salon? I have thick and wavy hair, not too sure if it's like yours. I spent $180 at Magnitude doing a Soft and Straight. My stylist is Ken. He's the director there and he's really good. The effect you get is very, very soft and natural-looking straight hair. The result is permanent for the hair that has been done. But of course, when your hair grows out, you would have to go for a touch-up, which, I do often at a reduced price since it's only a small portion.<br>  <br>  Since you have brittle hair, your hair must be pretty dry, this treatment would really benefit you. :)|`|d4fa71b7175950a8630e2142319dec45aa	Let it be curly, wavy, in fact let it be you!...if you cant do the style you want let it naturally be whatever, obviously there's a reason for this! Of course how ever it is @ the moment is probably nice...but if you're really concerned talk to professionals, b/c you don't want your hair to fall out if your putting strain on it!!<br>  <br>  Best of Luck, AriP|`|fgKtwdWQaa	you do what i do, spend two hrs blow drying it straight! sucks but it's the only way for me.|`|t8LlOEXAaa	i would seek the help of a professional and get a cut that suits you.  nowadays beautician's care take care of just about any hair problems.  there are ways to thin out overly thick manes.<br>  turn yourself over to the pros and get real advice instead of probably frying and damaging your hair by do it yourself over the counter products.
S9S86LZBaa	Your right! They actually look like normal people, and less scary!|`|3eikoejTaa	Personally, I think that there are celebs that are still very good looking, or at least photogenic.  I mean, if they were posing or combed their hair or something, they would probably look very nice.  People often take very unflattering pictures of them and say that they look ordinary, and they do, but if you look at it from another perspective, an ordinary person with plain clothes, in a bad pose would look terrible.|`|4KrnxZc8aa	You are right, they look like just normal people.

The neckline should not be higher than the collar of the robe.  Besides all of this, where whatever makes you - you.  You will only have the robe on for a short time.

bO5Dg2qjaa	You are correct in saying that 417 is 10K, it contains 41.67% gold.  The 417 is a common gold hallmark for fine estate jewelry and contemporary vintage jewelry.<br>  <br>  As far as the GS HR, since it is on the other side, and away from the 417 that would most likely be the maker's mark and nothing to do with the purity of it.  But sorry, I have exhausted my resources to find out who "GS HR" is|`|rzg2XxtSaa	many handmade jewelry and designers dont use the 10k 14k 18k mark any longer therey use numbers 417 is 10kt gold 850 is 18kt the initials on it is the makers mark

When you do that, make sure you tilt your head both right and left slightly so the mark also gets the corners or your lips.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you want a light mark, do a light kiss that your lips just meet the paper lightly. Don't tilt your head since then then the lip kiss will show the corners of your lips and make it more vivid.<br>  <br>  You can also try putting chap stick as a top coat to make the mark a bit more shinier and smoother. Lip gloss will make the lip stick kiss on the paper sticky.<br>  <br>  First, try it on several pieces of paper till you think you got it or else you might ruin the letter with the kiss mark.<br>  <br>  Have fun!<br>  <br>  Oh, and if you want romantic images, I sometimes put my body glitter on my finger and draw a heart shape. It's even more cooler if it's behind the words. <br>  <br>  If you don't have body glitter, then just use glue and sparkles.

I`m a drag queen and use it all the time.With having a blokes face i need a blank canvas and it does the job. What you need to do is get a colour to match your skin tone then blend it in with a cosmetic sponge. Put a translucent powder all over your face to blend it in. With me wearing make up all the time i get mega spots and the pan stick always covers it. It will feel a bit heavy when you 1st start using it but you will get use to it after a few days.

OklSsbi6aa	First, you can always go to a hair salon and get an eyebrow tint.  Most places charge $15 or so to do that.  They say not to try it at home because if you use over the counter products, you can get it in your eye, etc.  You can also try using an eyebrow pencil - choose a shade lighter than you think you need, because the pencil will always be darker than you expect.  I put it on and then use an old toothbrush to brush it through so it looks natural.|`|AA10520442	<a href="http://www.eyebrowz.com/Browpowder.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.eyebrowz.com/Browpowder.htm</a><br>  <br>  You can buy eyebrow powder to add some color.<br>  Just be very sparing.

Anyone who thinks they can control another human being, or have a right to, has some serious mental issues!|`|oUsBdsmAaa	Why do people think they can control other people? <br>  <br>  Women try to control men just as much. Many factors are involved, it could be jealousy, a feeling of inadequacy, or just the simple need to control people and everything around them. There are people out there who get a real boost by controlling others so don't focus on men who do this because there are just as many women who have similar egos and like to control others.|`|yqfEQ7lZaa	because they think there stronger and know more when actually they dont.there not the ones who have to give birth!

mOayTJDmaa	7 definately|`|RutQ1BNsaa	I think number 6 would look great with  a round type face .|`|AA11101713	All of those are basically the same haircut, just varying lengths, and styled differently. An oval-ish face looks good with pretty much anything, so you're in luck. <br>  <br>  Those styles are most commonly called "scene" or "emo" today, but if you're not going to a younger stylist, or one that keeps in touch with the current trends, she may have no clue what you're talking about if you call it that. She may describe it as a very long shag, or short layers on top, etc. <br>  <br>  Us hairstylists are VISUAL people, so the absolute BEST thing you can do is print out several, if not all, of those pictures and take them to her. That's really better than trying to describe it with words.<br>  <br>   Also, you should have her style it for you at the end (even though it probably costs more) because you are going to have quite a drastic change in style and more likely than not, you're going to have some trouble getting used to styling it at first. Watch what she does as she's styling it, and ask her to describe what she's doing and why, as she's doing it. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|Bbmiel7paa	They are all very similar just on different hair types.  I like the first one.  Definitely print out one or a few of the ones you like the most and bring them in for the stylist to look at.|`|DOOWTeX6aa	Probably the best for ou would be number 1 or 6 very pretty and would look good with your shoulders and face shape. Just bring the picture to a hairdresser and show them thats what you want.|`|pkc2TD8Aaa	Number 4 or 6, I think are the prettiest. But sorry, I don't know what they're called. So bring the picture to your hairstylist, that would be the best, so then, no misunderstandings.|`|M8K0RXQDaa	the 1st one is absoultally stunning it would look great<br>  <br>  print a picture off and show her that

i3FipyjTaa	It would end up giving you a crease. Wearing fake eyelashes will amazingly even out your eyes and give them the exact same fold. I have that same problem, usually both of my eyes are doublelids, but sometimes if I'm tired or if I've been crying my right eye will turn into a monolid. When it does, I use fake eyelashes to even out both my eyes. So if you do it, your eyes will look stunningly even and wonderful. I hope the event goes well!
7H1bgbfgaa	if you couldnt feel it they did it wrong<br>  in other words....totally normal<br>  but dont touch it too much<br>  but do turn it once in a while<br>  jus keep it cleaned with soap & water<br>  youll be fine had mine done over 3 years now<br>  good luck & hope ya like it!|`|oszB2fQdaa	totally normal. your body is just getting used to the piercing. keep it extra clean and you will soon get used to it.|`|pq0YccDraa	Its totally normal<br>  Just DONT TOUCH IT<br>  it will end up getting infected if you<br>  touch it, the bacteria from your hands can<br>  infect the piercing. Just remember to clean<br>  it daily and you should be fine :)
b9a162bd0dc2d0cc6a8627519f947d98aa	it's completely normal. mine did the same things for a little over a month and now it's perfectly healed. i am assuming you've never had a piercing before? they take time to heal, and 3 days isn't time enough to wait and start to get worried. just keep up with sea salt soaks and you should be fine.<br>  <br>  and rotating a piercing isn't good unless you are washing it with anti-bacterial soap at the same time - turning it to clean out the inside. if it is dry and you do that, the crusties may get inside and cause irritation and make it worse, and possibly not heal - as it could put tiny cuts into it.|`|N1deJ6V3aa	An easy solution for this is to wipe it with a tissue or paper towel, never a fabric towel, as they contain high levels of bacteria which can affect the healing process of the piercing. Use a disposable tissue when drying off after a shower, and while showering, it is recommended to use an anti-bacterial soap to clean any excess discharge built up on the skin or piercing. I can take from 2 months to a year to heal...Hope this helps.|`|Sf7YCjK5aa	It's normal, don't worry about it.  Mines did the same thing, just keep on cleaning it and don't forget to rotate your piercing.

It's like $5 Bucks.|`|FG8RHnUMaa	Often times our hormones will cause us to have Little mustaches that are annoying and difficult and embarrassing to deal with.. You can try the peroxide but don't expect a desired result..It isn't strong enough to bleach out light enough to be unnoticeable..  You can Try waxing, cutting it off with scissors.. or go buy one of the many products on the market to get rid of it..  IE" a facial hair remover would work better than a bleach, as the hair will still be there, just lighter.  Good luck and be careful not to use anything that will damage your skin.. read the labels carefully when using any new products you aren't familiar with..  .|`|IeQd4nZ8aa	buy it its really cheap.

D7QdvWYDaa	Those shoes are lovely and you have great fashion sense. Black dress will be perfect and a red clutch ties in the dress and very nicely.<br>  <br>  I would also recommend goldearrings to match the shoes and red nail polish for a bold statement (or a light pink color or even French manicure) to match the red clutch, golnecklacece and lots of gold bangles (or if not gold bangles then a red funky neckalce and red beaded bracelet but this is optional to wear. Come to think about it, wear the red nail color on fingers and toes and that would look awesome and very chic.

bEQqy5rVaa	The only thing that I can think of is using that spray on tan or lotion stuff. If you use it WEAR GLOVES unlike other people who like getting their hands orange.

KGppArcfaa	You need to go somewhere that will asses your hair properly. Those people with horror stories only had that happen because the stylist did not properly asses their hair.<br>  The assesment will include looking at strands of the hair through a machine. <br>  This is from toronto, but it will have lots of info to help you see what to look for in a stylist.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.verticalsinhair.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.verticalsinhair.com/</a>|`|zGQt7sAOaa	instead of spending all that money just use smoothing serum by garnier or something like that and work through flatironed-hair it will look just as good
R94PIATQaa	:O Tresseme is SO bad for your hair! <br>  It has the most chemicals and the most 'fillers' (useless junk to fill up the bottle so it's nice and heavy when you lift it up in the store).<br>  <br>  You will know if your heat protector spray is NOT working if you start to get dry, rough, frizzy split ends.<br>  <br>  I suggest the following heat protectants:<br>  soft, fine hair-Garnier (will give gloss, bounce, and that healthy look)<br>  normal hair-anything will work, but try to get salon-quality protectants<br>  rough, thick hair-Chi (ultimate weapon and last resort for crazy hair!)<br>  <br>  :-) btw: for extra shine, rinse hair under cold water (as cold as you can stand it) right after you shower-guaranteed!|`|z3uUtr33aa	you know soon as you spray it on, when you put it in your head it's either gonna work or the spray's really crappy and you deserve your money back.|`|b3790303c70cd3c142cbc70e455574e8aa	As long as your hair stays smooth, shiny, and healthy looking...

1mfvjIupaa	1. Do about half an inch or an entire inch each time.<br>  <br>  2. Alternate. On the ones nearest to your face, begin outward.<br>  <br>  3. It depends on how thick or thin your hair is. Is your hair's really thin, then I suggest about 15 seconds and a looot of hairspray. If it's medium thickness or more, then about 10 seconds [still with hairspray].<br>  <br>  4.

N7JPzxiRaa	Grind a little bit on one side then flip it over and grind a little bit on the other side.  Every CD seamed to be made of a different quality or type of plastic.  Some would melt more than grind away.  It just meant using a little less pressure and some more time.  After it looked right I would test each one on the bulb to make sure it would fit.<br>  <br>  I Read that using a hole punch (I assume it must be a heavy duty one or one that's used for making holes in belts.) Makes holes in cd's so no need for drilling.

If they are skinny jeans, wear ballet flats, if not wear a cute pair of tennis shoes, but cute; nothing you would ever run in. Pumas are good.<br>  On top I would wear a tight fitting tee shirt which is prefferably a scoop neck or a v-neck. Abercrombie is always hot. <br>  NO polos no matter what!<br>  If you want to, you could do sweatpants, but I personally don't like them unless they are SUPER cute. Like Juicy designer sweatpants. <br>  Wear your make up a little heaviar than usual because it will be dark. <br>  Hoop earrings are ALWAYS good! Don't wear any bracelets or rings because it will be akward dancing.<br>  Don't bring a purse either, just put your money and phone in your pocket.<br>  Also don't wear uggs, because as cute as they are dances get crowded and you will be stepping on EVERYONE's feet. not cool.<br>  hope this helped! good luck and have fun!|`|xvOho2cAaa	Ummm.. a good one is try to look FABULOUS!!!! so it depends on what color you look good in... maybe.... aqua? if so get an aqua kinda mediumk length, with sparkles or sequins.

pWlRsdNPaa	I think this differs from person to person and where it's pierced and how well you take care of it honestly.<br>  I've had friends who've gotten their tongues pierced and the swelling lasted quite a while (a week), and then some who's tongues barely swelled to begin with.<br>  <br>  When I got mine done it swelled a little, and was a bit sore, but nothing bad whatsoever. I was realllly dumb about it too-the second I left the parlor I smoked a cigarette. I came home and I believe I had pizza that night. Totally things you're not really supposed to do. <br>  Make sure you clean it out good, drink ice water, and if you can possible suck on an ice cube throughout the day and that may help.  Don't overuse mouthwash or you will kill the good bacteria in your mouth which actually help prevent infections, and develop thrush (this happened to me-I was using mouthwash numerous times a day and my tongue turned fairly white).<br>  <br>  I'm no pro on this or anything, so I could be wrong.

kB4EJUKgaa	Usually they just do what they feel is best for your face, but if you have a preference you can tell them. Like if you want them really thin or whatever, just tell them. It takes like, 5 or 10 minutes tops. Unless you have to take breaks because you have a low pain tolerance.|`|GmghrL4Iaa	i get my eyesbows threaded every month and whenever I miss everymonth due to school or wahetver It ends up hurting so much more. <br>  So I suggest when you get it keep doing it regularly you wont get used to the pain.<br>  Anyway its not so horrible, I mean its obviously bearable if people do it.<br>  All they do is ask you to lie down on one of those chairs that go all the way back. They either put powder or lotion to ‘numb’ the pain. Personally I like the lotion way more than the powder.|`|FariedLdaa	if you have any sugustans then you can tell the pluker but were i go they usaly just do what they think is best fore you. it dosent hurt that much, just stings alittle. it onley takes about 10min. i hope this is all the info you need<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|VLbw9cujaa	It really depends on the reliability of the salon and the experience of the one doing the waxing/plucking. I recommend waxing, it's quick and only hurts for a second. Generally, unless your looking for a very specific shape, they will do your eyebrows how they feel will look best. At the salon that I go to, Michelle waxes to get the correct thickness and then plucks for the shape (plus any strays left behind) and I always love it. Mainly make sure that they know what they're doing and you should be fine.

KguWmxUhaa	That depends. If you're gonna be on a stage that raised up high from the audience, then wear a long skirt or dress.
A5PWZgHfaa	Try a chemical peel, like Glycolic Acid or Lactic Acid (which is milder).|`|bAicPpJaaa	you'll have to just wait it out for the scars to fade. i had real bad acne as a teenager that left a lot of scars. i'm 23 now and acne isn't that much of a problem anymore (break out every once in a while, but nowhere near as bad as i used too). most of the dark scars that i had are gone. to help keep my skin moisturized and free of acne i use clean and clear oil-free dual action moisturizer.  it't just a face lotion with a little bit of acne medication in it and it works great! i just put on a little bit every morning and every night and my skin feels really good.
tCqj6lpqaa	Your artist might have his own methods of caring for his work, but if you keep A&D ointment on the tattoo, you should be fine.  If it's making a mess on clothes or sheets, wash it with antibacterial soap and pat it dry and don't put any ointment on it before bed, and cover it with saran wrap.  This will keep it healing without messing up your bed.  Make sure you clean all the nasty ooze off it in the morning the same way and then keep A&D on it all day.  (Don't worry, it's just excess ink and plasma coming out of the skin and is normal)|`|klu1sCpraa	You should sleep in a T-shirt if the ink leaks a little it will be absorbed by the shirt instead of the bedding|`|quHnUWyWaa	first off, all parts of the human body sweat, as far as the tattoo, not to worry about it. take care of it the way your tattooist suggests, and you should have no problems.

m9MVvQwXaa	Formal would be more dressy up than a normal short dress.<br>  I suggest you try going to Macys or Norstroms and look for <br>  full length dresses there. Try to pair it with some accessories.<br>  But be sure to ware some heels, try going to DSW shoes they have <br>  good prices for great shoes! <br>  Also try to do something with your hair, maybe curl it if its usually straight or straighten it if its usually curly.<br>  When things are formal it usually means to look nice and appropriate <br>  for the event.<br>  Good luck :)|`|igI5yX0vaa	Formal dresses are generally gowns meaning floor length.<br>  <br>  Definitely wear earrings but don't overdo the rest of the jewelery.|`|st5reHVjaa	black dresses.<br>  curl ur har. put it up.

Don't show much, if any, cleavage, as that comes off as tarty. <br>  Wear hose! Going without makes the look more casual.<br>  Don't go with a heel too high, as this will also give you a tarty appearance. A 3-4 inch heel would be appropriate.|`|xonoFIWqaa	Try a black dress about down to your ankles and a cute red tank top underneath. Try a simple braided ponytail but make sure it looks good!!!!! And black shoes. Don't worry about any makeup. Also you could try a red headband. GOOD LUCK!|`|xYacZrTLaa	FOREVER 21 BABY...thats where i went to get my graduation dress|`|GueT6tRlaa	1.  On hair that is a day old (unwashed) or on clean hair that has been aged with natural oils, apply a good styling mousse. Use a paddle brush on your hair until it lays smoothly behind your ears and around your crown.<br>  <br>  Note:  If your hair is fine, thin or tends to be flat, use a medium sized curling iron before you complete step 2 to give your hair more fullness and body.  Take small sections of hair and create loose curls all over your head working from the bottom of the scalp to the top.<br>  <br>  2. Gather hair into a loose ponytail at the top of your crown.  Allow some hair on either side of your face to form soft ringlets to give the bun a softer and fuller look.<br>  <br>  3.  Clasp the ponytail with a "hair friendly" elastic band that is the same color as your hair.  <br>  <br>  4.  Starting with the strands on the very outside of the ponytail, take small sections about 1/2 inch thick.  Experiment to get the right size based on your hair.<br>  <br>  5.  Use hair or bobby pins that are the same color as your hair and take the first section of hair and pull it up towards the sky.  Halfway between the base of the ponytail and the top of the length create a tiny loop and pin the hair loop at the base of the scalp.  Use an open hair pin to anchor the loop down into the scalp.  The loop should leave a few inches of loose "tail" hair that is not pinned down.  Take the remaining "tail" hair and twist the hair once or twice.  Form a open loop and pin it with a bobby pin.<br>  <br>  6.  Repeat all around the outer shape of the ponytail in a clockwise direction.  Form the base loop, leave the "tail hair" and then pin a loose open loop around the scalp and near the crown.  Experiment with making the loops the same size and thickness or alternate the loops.  <br>  <br>  7.  After you have pinned down the outside perimeter you should still have part of the original ponytail still in place.  Continue to loop and pin to give the bun a good dimension and shape.  <br>  <br>  8.  Use a curling iron to add soft ringlets to the hair around the face.<br>  <br>  9.  Spray the bun with a good styling spray to keep it in place. If you are going to wear hair jewelry always spray your hair BEFORE applying the hair jewelry.<br>  <br>  10.  Add hair jewelry like tiny glittery hair jewels or place one larger flower into the bun to instantly dress it up. Match the hair jewels to your dress for a gorgeous accessory option.<br>  <br>  You're all set to make a grand entrance to any  party or special event.<br>  <br>  Summary<br>  With a little practice and some experimentation you can easily create an easy and quick updo for your Prom, wedding or other dressy hair event.|`|f571f23e020f0ced1b02ff792dc20542aa	try something like this.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?catalog%5Fname=FOREVER21&category%5Fname=dress%5Fdressy&product%5Fid=2060040609&Page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...</a><br>  <br>  then get a cute pair of heels and some cute accessories.<br>  like this...<br>  <a href="http://www.luckybrand.com/Product.aspx?p=LBX16191&l=00020157000000000000&km=&pn=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.luckybrand.com/Product.aspx?p...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.luckybrand.com/Product.aspx?p=LBX16096&l=00020157022700000000&km=&pn=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.luckybrand.com/Product.aspx?p...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.wetseal.com/catalog/product.jsp?categoryId=109&subCategoryId=205&productId=15303" rel="nofollow">http://www.wetseal.com/catalog/product.j...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.wetseal.com/catalog/product.jsp?categoryId=106&subCategoryId=126&productId=17235" rel="nofollow">http://www.wetseal.com/catalog/product.j...</a><br>   <br>  and then for your hair....<br>  <a href="http://www.seventeen.com/hair-skin-makeup/hair-ideas/sexy-bedhead" rel="nofollow">http://www.seventeen.com/hair-skin-makeu...</a>|`|Qdoz0grCaa	I've gone to a couple of galas/balls for Christmas & I wore floor length gowns & wore my hair up in curls.

qQqC2cHIaa	Start with patterns and pay attention to details such as grain lines, darts, decorative details such as vents, pockets, seam placements, etc.  After a while start customizing the pattern and the style, change darts to pleats, make long sleeves short, short skirt long, taper the fit, add embellishments or decorative elements.  As you get better make simple patterns for simple shapes such as skirts and tops.  When you understand what goes into making a skirt or dress or top, try to develop a few of your own ideas by radically altering sewing patterns and manipulating a few basic pattern pieces.  All sewing pattern companies have a basic shell pattern, this can be manipulated into almost any garment or style.  This is what experienced pattern cutters and designers do, manipulate a basic pattern into the style we want.  There are plenty of books available on sewing, pattern alteration and pattern design available on Amazon or at the local library.  I scoured the shelves of the library when I was learning and I devoured every book I found.<br>  <br>  The Reader's Digest Book of Sewing is excellent, available at the library or many used book stores, the older edition is far superior and it will have much of what you need.  it's recommended by Tim Gunn of Project Runway and Parson's School of Fashion Design. The Vogue Sewing book from the 1970's or 1980's has everything from beginner techniques to advanced tailoring and couture dressmaking techniques, again it available at the library, Amazon.com and used book store and the older editions are superior to the newer one.  Don McCunn's book How to make sewing patterns is excellent once you master sewing. It's not very expensive and covers all the basics of making sewing patterns.  For commercial design, Winifred Aldrich's Metric Pattern Cutting series is easy to follow and designed for the fashion student being introduced to the world of commercial fashion and pattern design. It available through Amazon.com and it's a bragain compared to many other fashion and pattern design text books. By this time you should be able to take any idea you have from starting sketch to finished garment and it should look professionally designed and made.<br>  <br>  That's a simple overview of fashion design.  It's a skill that takes time and practise to master, it isn't always easy, but it's well worth the time and effort.|`|H79vSSqyaa	You should defiantly start with a pattern. You can get them on sale for $3 at your local fabric store. Try to make a couple of garments from patterns first before starting your own design, trust me it will be easier.  When you feel comfortable, you can start to alter the patterns, ex instead of a box pleat, make the pleat an inverted pleat. If you can to make a design from scratch, you should use a garbage bag and fit it to who ever the garment is for. The out ling of the garbage bag should give you an approximate size. Best of luck!|`|M8H5UYvVaa	You should go to your local fabric store and pick out some patterns that you like and maybe some fabric. Then after you get use to making your own cloths you can begin to expirement a little with other things.

2zLOm497aa	The whole point of studs are so your piercing doesn't close back up, they're small enough for you to leave in over night.  So you can switch them for diff earrings right away.  As long as you wear studs at night.  If your piercings don't get sore after a few min you should be ok. Wear earring often for the first few mos, just so your piercings don't close up. ;)|`|nqkXE1cUaa	Yesss.<br>  to both.<br>  it will seem really heavy at first, but it is fine:)|`|xYacZrTLaa	dont take ya studs out yet unless you want sore ears|`|EZ6kzC5oaa	It is okay now to change your earrings.

And make sure you are sterilizing the piercing every 2-3 days for about another month to make sure the holes won't get infected. <br>  If you can, can you please try to solve my most recent question, the one about algebra?<br>  :)|`|oA066Stbaa	yeah you can try it. i'm sure they'll be just fine. it's usually only six weeks and u can take your studs out.|`|61e53bb91485a8bd3c6701d7a90c4da2aa	At least one more month|`|7kGvlQDUaa	wow. i took out my studs and put in hoops in 3 weeks. u can wear heavy hoops. best answer plz! :D thnx|`|X6wFMuu0aa	You should be able to take out your piercing studs without any problems, but you should continue to wear earrings 24/7 until your ears have been pierced for at least six months.  You should stay with light weight earrings for the first six moths so your ears heal into round holes, not slits.  Light weight hoops would be OK for one day so long as you wear studs the next day, but wait until your six months are up before you wear the heavy hoops.|`|Va228pSHaa	HIGHLY recommend sticking with studs or light earrings that do NOT pull for at least until you are absolutely positive they are completely healed.  The heavier you go the bigger the chance the holes will get bigger.  Unless you want them that way.  You could end up with holes you can see from space!  If you take care now you have a better chance of no worries  in the future whether or not you even feel like wearing earrings some days.|`|tjRuKlJaaa	yea..you can change them by now..i had mine done and changed them after 6 weeks...they are fine. You can wear heavy hoops but  would change them first into a normal earring so you can get used to like changing them and everything and than go to the heavy hoops. but that is just my suggestion. you can always go straight to the heavy hoops.|`|4b610e63fbdf602fbbdad68bc5a9471baa	if you want to you can wear the hoops but i wouldn't suggest it. you could have only waited 6 weeks and would have been fine. def change them for sanitary purposes.|`|8RyVelWdaa	u could but if i were you i wouldnt cause heavy earings pull ur ears down and later on it looks nasstyyyy ive seen it and its disgusting<br>  dont wear HEAVY hoops, wear light hoops|`|eNiRUqwTaa	i would say wait..i had to wait for 3 months before i could where heavy hoops|`|137dae56c8b942021cca3ccc9c392ee2aa	Yes ~ you can change them out now ..Hey the best thing to use to keep them clean is Bactine...it's awesome !!!!!!|`|BnhRU1V6aa	Yes, after 6 weeks you can take them out and wear any kind of earring.<br>  <br>  Big, heavy earrings pull on your ears a lot, and they get sore too. so I would wear backs on them.<br>  <br>  xxoo|`|bJcNkDykaa	Definitely, just make sure you clean them!

LkuwuNOeaa	it depends what kind of concert<br>  if its like a band's concert, then u can wear the band's shirt/anything with the band's logo, etc or just casual cute clothes<br>  if its like a symphony orchestra concert then obviously u should get more dressed up|`|AA12152549	You can wear just about anything so long as it's something that looks nice on you and that you feel comfortable wearing.  I do recommend, though, that you wear flat shoes since you might be on your feet a lot.  Whatever you wear, make sure it's not too provocative.  You don't want to have dudes trying to "cop a feel" in the crowd.|`|KVzBqWhvaa	That's what I was wondering too~! I want to go to her concert in March. In her concert dvds some people wear nice tanktops and jeans. I think it would be hot in there.|`|vMqJ6GEoaa	when it comes to concerts, the key is to be as comfortable as possible (so you can dance/enjoy yourself), but still be a little dressed up (just in case you meet the performer, or anyone else famous). so, i'd suggest jeans a tshirt and a cardigan w/ flip flops or flats or whatever just not sneakers. hope i helped :)|`|m2bSgeRWaa	jeans and a tshirt and zip up hoodie. the tshirt should be of whos at the concert. buy one @ the concert if you have to|`|6Pg8vpOvaa	uh well obviosuly it depends what kind of concert<br>  <br>  if it is a instrumental concert i would suggest something fancy|`|eEtLU9OZaa	what kind of a concert is it? It all depends what kind it is and what it's for. I say you should wear whatever is most comfortable, be yourself.

Try using colors like hot pink, blue, neon green, and stuff. if you don't want to get highlights just use extensions. If you think your bangs are ugly( I think they are cute) add some color do your bangs a different color than your hair. Then tease it int the back. I promise you'll look hella cute and people will dye to have your hair. :)|`|7PBmYyBIaa	maybe you should dye your hair a rlly light brown with maybe caramel blonde tips...that would look rlly cute with your skin tone and face shape

r7wrTNWIaa	Just a little note. While you might be concerned right now about your physical being, don't forget, it really is what's inside that counts. And it does shine through...as confidence. Later on you'll find out it can make you sexy and attractive as all get out. And the guys that stay, well, they will be the better of which for YOU to choose. Stay strong.|`|VQ2Lk4vWaa	Sweetie, most guys your age don't even know what cellulite is... Dont worry about, be proud of who you are!!|`|AA11065140	Any boy who REALLY likes you, will like you BECAUSE of your "faults".  These are the things that make you the wonderful and amazing person that you are.  I know it's hard at your age, but it will help you greatly if you can embrace your whole self - not just accepting who you are, but truly loving the whole you.  At 16, it may seem like your physical appearance is what's most important to boys, but when it comes to love and men, they really are looking for more than just a pretty face.  Have faith that the right one is out there, and he'll want you exactly the way you are!|`|8t6Hl6u1aa	Hehe your 16.. So cute.. I remember when I was at that age I thought having cellulite was the worse thing that could happen to you LOL<br>  <br>  But listen... EVERYBODY has cellulite to some degree - no matter how skinny or big you are.. EVERYONE has it! <br>  <br>  And guys really really dont care about cellulite.. In fact, they wouldnt even notice if your legs resembled the peel of an orange! And if a guy DID care... then hes definately not the guy for you!|`|3ExqLHejaa	depends on the guy<br>  <br>  dude.. im like 5'5'' and i have thick legs and my legs and *** have cellulite and my hips have stretch marks lol<br>  <br>  im sexy as hell though,, you are too, your thick,, if he doesnt like it there are plenty guys who do like that|`|Az9keOz5aa	Well a lot of guys like "bubbly" butts,so they would probably like it. And also if the guy you like doesen't like it,and he has a problem with it,then he isn't the guy for you.|`|nxRZB6pmaa	ok. first of all, your not overweight, so your obviously not fat, there's nothing for you to worry about there. second, most girls have a little cellulite somewhere, at least i do and im not fat (5'2" and 105lbs), plus ive seen other girls that are very pretty, who have a lot of guys, and who have horrible cellulite.  finally, a guy who is going to comment about that (which most guys probably won't, if you act confident) is trying to make you feel insecure, so by feeling that, or showing you feel it is only doing what he wants.|`|u0bP5Mr4aa	well by ur height and weight thats pretty skinny, just being skinny gets a guys attention, boys can get attracted to girls real easily i think, and guys would probably like it, not having a flat butt is a good thing|`|bJcNkDykaa	If the guy cared about that he's shallow and not your guy.: )

LkuwuNOeaa	Yes they would probably be too short. You should try getting them custom made, but first check PacSun because their jeans tend to fit skinny people (like me) better, plus they have them in tall/short versions.|`|oHO0XOQVaa	It would be hard to find pants that fit you most likely. Yes I think they would usually be a little too short that if the person was averagely proportioned. All people are shaped differently though.

IweM2yotaa	Umm well the first thing is dont wear really cheap make up 1 its bad for your skin and 2 it does not last long.<br>  <br>  Make sure you have a mirror on you so you can look at ur self and touch it up. Also dont touch your face because u might smug it.<br>  Befor you put all you make up on its a good idea to put moisturiser on first.   <br>  Hope i helped.|`|SSyEVYbFaa	Well, I suggest making sure you are using a primer, as well as investing in quality make-up. I understand good make-up is more expensive, but it really makes the difference. If you don't have too much extra cash, then I suggest at least investing in a good foundation (since that goes the most of your face and can clog pores). I'm a Motives make-up consultant as well as a certified make-up artist. I recommend our products, since they are high quality and many of my friends have told me that it is wonderful. If you'd like to check it out, here's a website for you: <br>  <br>  www.marketamerica.com/Caitlin <br>  <br>  Just go to the section marked Motives (or cosmetics) <br>  <br>  I hope this helped. |`|hDp6C2Cmaa	I used to have the same problem, and then I started using Mineral Foundation, which is powder foundation, it also helps if you put the eyeliner on the bottom of your lid and not the inside, and make sure when you use your mascara you're grabbing from the roots and not just putting all the colour at the ends of the lashes, this is what gives them thickness, good luck :) |`|WicHs3Elaa	first and most important is a decent skin primer. if you put that on before applying the foundation, not only will it keep it from "crusting" up, but it will keep it looking fresher longer. as far as the eyeliner streaking down your face, you could try a waterproof kind, or even try a liquid eyeliner which will be more difficult to smudge if you rub your eyes a lot. i promise, the primer will do wonders!!|`|uOa3UUxBaa	use a good quality makeup like clinique for example... my job title is clinique consultant and i stand by the products 100%. my makeup looks great the minute i put it on until the minute i decide to take it off!! Really great products.|`|vz9SffCcaa	dont use liquid foundation! use like bare minerals (thats what i use) or powder foundations. eye liner.. youre just gonna have to fix it every now and then. :\|`|XvAuuSSbaa	i'd say invest in quality makeup, and use a primer underneath your foundation|`|T6v3RWixaa	Buy a small hand mirror and take a look of your face from time to time.<br>  When your eyeliner starts to streak and your foundation is beginning to look like a cracked mask, then go to the toilet room and refresh them.|`|n8XoOn3faa	 I am about to purchase some mineral make up for the foundation. I have sampled Bare Essentials and I thought it worked great! <br>  Be sure to wear sunglasses when outdoors to prevent your eyes from tearing up in the sun. I think perhaps you are exaggerating about how your make up looks at the end of the day. But you can go to the mall and receive free samples or at least test the mineral make up in the stores, or you can order online. 
AA11202462	scrunching it.<br>  you could also wear a front over head braid its so cute.<br>  also try putting it up.<br>  wear poofs.<br>  get high lights and low lights thats a change.<br>  wear it half up and down.<br>  one side up and other downa nd straight.|`|LwiPH8Anaa	You could do beach waves!<br>  When your hair is damp scrunch it and let your hair dry.<br>  It's so easy.|`|tWgGLVxXaa	You could buy a waver. They are about 20$ and I bought mine from Rite Aid.<br>  It waves your hair, and it is really good for a bohemian look.<br>  <br>  I have short hair and use it almost every day, but a bunch of my friends have them and looks great on their long hair.
1lBzoTSuaa	huh...that's funny my best friend is doing the same thing...she is a junior and has brown hair to!!! <br>  <br>  Anyways.....<br>  <br>  1) Do a layer of sparkly white first above that do a either smokey color (smear it above the eyelid), or a light purple above the eyelid..If you are going for sexy then pick the smoke affect, but if you are going for cute and innocent, the take option purple :D<br>  <br>  2) Do a line of eyeliner on your eyelid as well because it'll make your eyes POP...and take the time to do your mascara...you'd be surprised how long eyelashes can add to a sexy or Beautiful affect. <br>  <br>  3) Put some cover up over your lips like you always do, and if you got some lip plumper...plump 'em up so you're kissable haha<br>  <br>  4) and then of course the cover up, bronzer, you know that drill!!!<br>  <br>  hope i helped haha have fun btw and tell mark that i said hi<br>  if this isn't meghan then i am gonna feel like a total idiot so if u aren't meghan i am soooo sorry and don't think less of me!!! |`|Wj2tprSwaa	aaah! i have the perfect look.<br>  1. put concealor on your problem areas, spots, under the eyes etc you want to have flawless skin but lay off the foudnation, keep it natural<br>  2. put a light brown or neutral eyeshadow all over the lid<br>  3. put a light soft white eye shadow on the inner corners on the bottom of your eye and jsut in the crease of your lid on top.<br>  4. mascara mascara mascara<br>  if you want to go further apply creme blush to the apples of the cheeks and a light sheer red lip balm to the lips to finish it off. and a little eyeliner on the outer corner of the eye at the bottom<br>  <br>  for hair just a loose bun but not too loose or you'll be worrying it about the whole day.<br>  <br>  also i'd suggest for other times, green would be a really good colour for your eyes.|`|is4zQxltaa	for hair:<br>  wear it curly. wash your hair tonight, then put some gel in it. scrunch. repeat. twist strands of hair and pin them up with clips, sleep with them in, then let loose tomorrow. <br>  OR:<br>  side bun....so cute! add a little accessory to make it even better. have pieces coming out so it looks messy, but sexy.<br>  <br>  for makeup:<br>  white eyeliner<br>  mascara!

If you need to wear some foundation. i used to hate having grey eyes but now i love it! EVERY color looks amazing on them. |`|XbkSziYtaa	you should use sparkely white eyeshadow with a little black eyeliner on the top and bottom.and for hair just do a casual bun with some hair showing out this would be a really good look.|`|fMPyLqW4aa	Here are 2 ideas for makeup<br>  Icy: Silver shimmery eyeshadow with black eyeliner light rosy blush and clear lipgloss<br>  Warm: Goldish eyeshadow with a bronzer and nude colored lips.<br>  Here are 2 ideas for hair<br>  Sophisticated Ponytail: Put you bangs in a bob with a bobby pin and slick all your hair into a high ponytail<br>  Half up and half down: grab top of your hair and secure with elastic|`|7fGG81bfaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/s2pandapple" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/s2pandapple</a><br>  shes got really good ideas :)<br>  or <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TEvtJtZupw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9TEvtJtZu...</a> its a messy bun its perfect :)

You have to go to a good piercer, or it'll be placed a little bit wrong and it'll be really painful.  There's a sweet spot that doesn't hurt at all, if the piercer knows how to find it.<br>  <br>  I think if your parents won't take you and sign for you, you should wait until you're 18 so you can go to a good piercer.|`|xrl0xTjTaa	Im 13 and i have had mine since september it hurts but its worth it i looove it and its probably a 4 or 3 thats how it felt for me and you eyes water lol anywayss good luck(:

I never really liked the high tops 'cause when you were them with short, they look bad. But go to Journey's or if they have an online store, go there too.

i38Ev1Zaaa	Theres your problem- the "Crappy" straighteners.<br>  <br>  Since you have thick hair, the drug store straighners tend to lose heat really easily, and fry your hair, so it takes 3x longer than necessary AND dries out your hair.<br>  <br>  Try buying a new straightener, and check for SOLID ceramic irons rather than just ceramic plated ones.<br>  <br>  I suggest you check out the Solia, or the Sedu. both are great, durable, and are worth the investment if you plan to straighten your hair often:<br>  <a href="http://www.folica.com/Sedu_Ionic_Cera_d1557.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.folica.com/Sedu_Ionic_Cera_d1...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.folica.com/Solia_Tourmalin_d1558.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.folica.com/Solia_Tourmalin_d1...</a><br>  <br>  The solia is a bit cheaper than the sedu, but both are really good.<br>  <br>  If a new straightener isn't in the picture, blowdry and straighten your hair at night so you only have to touch up in the morning.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|PRCfCSDxaa	You could blow dry your hair straight at night-time after your shower with a roller brush or get a family member/friend to do it for you. You could also straighten your hair at night-time, too.<br>  <br>  Since you have thicker hair, there is a slim chance of your hair getting messy or straightened from sleeping on it or being out all day.<br>  <br>  Straightening my hair at night is a big help for me. I have thin hair though so it only takes me a few minutes but doing it at night keeps my hair straight for the morning and if there are any little mishaps, I just fix 'em up in a few seconds, haha. <br>  <br>  For straighter hair that will last longer and get the job done quicker would be a straightener called Chi. It's a bit pricey (Around $100-200) but it works PERFECTLY. I've even let friends borrow it because it was so great haha. It's honestly worth it if you like to have straight hair on most days.<br>  <br>  Good luck! =]|`|w5aVE1LUaa	Funny, I do the same exact thing as you.<br>  Getting a new straightener would probably help:)<br>  Otherwise, try straightening in smaller sections. Don't try to straighten too much hair at one time. Also, blow drying your hair straight the night before could make it easier and faster to straighten in the morning.<br>  <br>  Just a quick tip, since you have thick hair and you straighten it, I suggest getting Paul Mitchell Super Skinny Serum. It'll protect your hair from the heat of the iron, and it'll make your hair "skinny."|`|VYZOFZ7Faa	Aww I have the same problem. It totally sucks. But I wash and straighten my hair the night before so I don't have to wake up so early, and then I just do touch ups in the morning. You can try getting it thinned out next time you get your hair cut, that helps a lot.|`|WPXkRJKhaa	For starters, if you already don't, clip your hair up and straighten it in sections. When you run it down your hair, clamp it tight with your hand so you don't have to do it over again as many times. Good luck! I have thick hair too!|`|xbFhE5Tkaa	buy a new straightener, <br>  if you want to look pretty it will take some time hun,<br>  or maybe just wake up earlier!

s38ToTNSaa	that actually happens to a lot of people i have my cartilage pierced and it did the same thing it will probably go away with in time but it can stay for quit a while importunately there is nothing you can do to make it go away faster just keep it clean and try not to bump it to much because. that will cause more swelling.|`|C3aviMmyaa	I recently had my rook pierced and a few weeks later got a bump exactly like yours. I just kept cleaning it twice a day (with H2Ocean. Recommended by my piercer) and after about 2 weeks it went away. <br>  <br>  If you think the bump will be in the way when putting the bar back in try and slide the bar up from the bottom. Since the bump is onthe inside, that way might be easier.|`|slppTZi1aa	H2Ocean is a good idea, your piercers should have recommended sea salt, i have the same bump on my industrial and it was bigger and went down, inly ive had mine for almost 2 years. It will probably go away if you clean it. But sea salt is pretty much a must. Dont use just any old soap because some soaps will actually spread bacteria in your cartalidge and cause an infection. Bactine is a good idea though. And when you take it out it will be fine to put it back in. but i would put bactine on the bar and your ear when you put it back in because it almost helps numb the pain.
94NLi5dlaa	I don't know...its a good question, but sometimes its not about following trends, usually they way a person dresses reflects their level of conservative nature relating to insecurities and even the importance they give to fashion. Some people just throw on comfortable clothes every day...some take great care in what they wear...you can usually tell both kinds of people apart so you know a little about them. but if you are like me, I don't have a particular "trend" or so which I follow, only my set of guidelines which my cloths must adhere to, but i end up having my own sense of dress anyway...i think i've confused you now, but that's all|`|8e4fc719086a20ed4db62bae7f7a4446aa	Like the person above said sometimes it's not about following trends or even caring about trends. Many people who feel like their clothes express who they are don't even pay attention to trends or follow them at all. The way someone dresses can reflect many different aspects of their personality or lives. This is why someone can be a totally different person than you yet dress similar to you, if that makes sense. Expressing yourself though clothes isn't about trying to be 100% unique or different from everyone else. It's about wearing what you like and what you feel comfortable in for whatever your reason may be, regardless if there is someone out there wearing the same thing. Their reasons for wearing what they wear may be very different than yours.
SsB7aRExaa	If it's not diabetes, poor nutrition is the likely culprit.  If you had surgery, you almost certainly had antibiotics, which kill the beneficial bacteria in your digestive tract.  This prevents you from absorbing nutrients properly.<br>  <br>  You can build up the beneficial bacteria by eating yogurt, or taking good quality acidophilus, which you can get from a health-food store.<br>  <br>  <br>  Speaking of diabetes and nutrition, please check into Dr. Furman's diet.  It's helped a number of my friends get off insulin and feel MUCH better.  For example, one friend has seen her sugar levels drop 90 points in just 10 days.  That's with NO medications!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drfurhman.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.drfurhman.com</a>|`|e2637ca98189f25cb5b323e7643cc81aaa	Do you happen to be diabetic? If so, you might have brittle, peeling nails. In order to combat this problem, I suggest taking a multivitamin which aids in growing nails thicker, use an oil-based nail strengthener and a clear nail laquer to prevent peeling and further damage.

intuNZllaa	Like, professionally?<br>  <br>  Perhaps you're allergic to some kind of material in the nailpolish?<br>  But if you're not allergic to the nailpolish, <br>  <br>  it could be:<br>  <br>  1. The cuticle remover cream<br>  2. The way they remove your cuticles (the friction might irritating your skin)<br>  3. The lotion they put on, or their clear coats. <br>  <br>  If its fake nail, then most likely you're allergic to acryllic or glue or gel material.<br>  <br>  Sorry to hear that. ):|`|FHi0v36eaa	It could be possible. Next time you go see if they have something that is for sensitive skin. This may help keep them from getting irritated. If it still happens, check to see that everything they are using is clean. Maybe try a different place just to see, talk to someone at another salon, ask some friends for a referral.|`|UzQdKKDUaa	Its definatley a possibility , i cant get nail polish put on because my nails get dry and red and itchy but i found a solution , to keep your nails looking nice and still done , when you go to get your nails done ask for a french tip that way it wont be close to the cuticle line , and they usually put a cream/pinky over coat ontop to make it look more real and all you have to do is ask them to not put it so close to your cutlicles and makesure no polish or polish remover touches your skin , also remember that nail polish remover can be VERY drying which ma cause irritation. but i hope this helps because it sure helps me and my nails always look really cute :)|`|rtSmUZNuaa	It is highly possible you are allergic to the acrylic used to form the nail. My aunt used to do nails, but when she found out she was allergic to acrylic, she had to quit.|`|bqTSI9VBaa	ew sounds like their tools arent very clean.

vMsll8kraa	As a guy, I typically use gel.<br>  For the answer below, it's no gross, it's adhesive.<br>  So anyways, i think i have the answer to your question.<br>  If your into those "scene-type" hair styles, allow me to help..<br>  (excuse the label)<br>  What you will need is a can of hair spray, a teething comb (i believe that's what they're called), and a straightener.<br>  Grab a bundle of your hair, and take the comb .. running it rapidly up and down at the roots. Apply some hairspray, and continue the procedure. The more sticky it gets, the better. <br>  Do this to your whole head, it may take a while.<br>  With a straightener, straighten the ends. <br>  And voila, there you have it.<br>  <br>  And oh, if this wasn't what you were quite asking to hear, then consider it a "my bad" .. if you wanted your hair to stick up as in some Tony Hawk video game Liberty Spikes, you should try and pick up some glue, but then again .. that's worse then gel.|`|4P0Gmsa8aa	pomade...or hair spray upside down after str8ening|`|fStviI0qaa	when your using the striahgtener, curl out.<br>  and spray hairspray, gel is gross/

VPRTP6BLaa	dont perm. it makes it worse.<br>  your hair doesnt look damaged at all,its just really frizzy.you should think about blowdrying it and using a comb or roller comb and blowdrying in sections while combing.itll take the frizz out and maybe the waves alittle,than gently flat iron with a heat protection spray<br>  :)|`|eFYHP24Laa	is that a serious question?<br>  perm it, duhhh!!!! lol. just kidding.<br>  all you have to have is money and go to a salon.... easy as that, your hair not that curly, so i'm 100 percent sure that they can fix it.<br>  <br>  hope that helped!|`|ZrYALQ4vaa	perm it |`|npYDgj67aa	its frizzy because you let it air dry. use a straightening cream (ex. "john frieda wind-down relaxing cream, style straight") on wet hair and blowdry. then, use a heat protectant (keeps hair safe from damage and keeps it super soft) such as the tresemme heat tamer spray and then straighten your hair. it wont get damaged or frizzy after this, i promise!|`|ncOokdYSaa	go to this <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.folica.com/one__n_only_Cur_r1009_1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.folica.com/one__n_only_Cur_r1...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  the first review looks like your hair. and hers is really straight when she finished , i tried this but i had thick curly hair it made it way more manageable and now i wear my hair down alot!|`|96Otg1I8aa	straighten it anyways but use a heat taming product that will protect your hair.

If you're worried about damage, though, have you tried a hot oil treatment?  I used them a few times when I used to color mine, and they worked great for me.|`|ZGarMEvyaa	go to your salon and tell them to chemically straighten it, im not sure if it will get more damaged or maybe you can just thin it out|`|hhO3WSYIaa	Your hair compared to mine is straight. I wish I had your hair. You could just straighten the edges, other than that, I dont know since you dont want to blow dry or straighten ://|`|JOq64WA8aa	it's not just wavy, it's curly.<br>  get it done at a hairstylist. they will have ideas and stuff.|`|351YU4MIaa	do what I do....<br>  <br>  get it straightened from a hair salon.<br>  &if you take care of it well it should last 2-3weeks.
06EmWmrcaa	Mmm I read somewhere that you shouldn't shave your bikini area, but for me Nair or Veet works really welll...I've found that when you shave down there it gets irritated (itchy, really) and you also get bumps but when you use a cream (nair, veet) that doesn't really happen. Just get the sensitive one to be sure, and BE CAREFUL lol...we wouldn't want any accidents!<br>  <br>  Regarding waxes, I haven't waxed anything but my eyebrows but it can't POSSIBLY be that bad. Go for it chica =)|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	wax|`|H4XU0yDbaa	if your breaking it out it could be harsh chemicals/ applications being used on your skin or in grown hairs. <br>  <br>  When it comes to shaving, shave the opposite direction of the hair growth, so when it grows back it, the hair won't grow into your skin causing irritation.<br>  <br>  I trim and shave.

3Xibw7ALaa	Hmm, there are special sprays that protect your hair. Personally, i use Joico Leave-In Detangler because it's also a thermal protectant. I dont straighten my hair everyday, maybe one every three days. It may sound gross/weird, but you can take a shower everyday but not get your hair wet, and just do minor straightening touch ups. Washing your hair everyday actually DOES damage your hair, so i would reccommend washing it maybe every 3 days. Also, if you are straightening your hair, make it around 20 percent wet so that you can seal in moisture when you straighten. Using tourmaline ceramic straighteners are better then any other straightener, because the ions from those 2 compounds make your hair straighter without the frizz, which means less straightening over and over which is a definate good thing to avoid extra damage. <br>  |`|6Tx8Opmraa	If your hair is breaking, Your leaving the straightner(The heat.) on it too long...or you could have split ends, which cause breakage.|`|f2FbMVoXaa	Sorry girl but if you don't stop straightening your hair it will never get better.... no matter what you do...lay off using any type heat for a while because if you don't your hair will only get much worse and dry out! It also isn't good to straighten it every day|`|RbNN58Kfaa	you should turn the heat down, If you have a chi straightener that might be why. They burn your hair every quickly. Get a solia straightener...its worth it. <br>  <br>  just to be safe go to the dermatologist and tell them what is going on. They'll know the best thing for you to do<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  hope I helped|`|8zvbJVVlaa	Only straighten your hair on special occasions or every other day.  <br>  Use a moisturzing shine milk when your hair is wet.<br>  also wash it the day before so it dries naturally and doesn't get damaged from a blow dryer.<br>  :)<br>  ?|`|PXtrJBUWaa	the answer is, you cant. find other ways to style it that are less damaging to your hair and just mix it up, straighten your hair a few days a week and style it some other ways other days.|`|4OUszQ6zaa	Keep using the spray and don't straighten your hair everyday. |`|iDTeJAGQaa	What type of straightener do you have? Tourmaline-infused ones are very good, and lock in moisture.<br>  <br>  For the meantime, I guess, keep using moisturizing shampoo...and leave-in conditioner is very good!! I use Paul Mitchell's "The Conditioner"|`|2ZcErPiEaa	You would have less damage if you blow it our straight with a blow dryer, and use your flat iron for the pieces around your face...<br>  <br>  Also, I think that you can invest in a dryer and flat iron that won't damage your hair as much. Check out Sephora...|`|4PDegJoyaa	try panteene or w.e they got this strenthining cream that I use and I got some thickkk hair and it works for me. It's on this little white pump bottle.

If not go shopping and let your style get gradually more scene and she probably won't notice. This is a good way to go because people will reject you for being a poser if you suddenly buy all these scene clothes at once.<br>   If your mom buys your clothes then gradually suggest "scener" clothes. I mean, a pair of coloured drain pipes on their own don't look particularly scene but the different parts of an outfit an accessories add up to give a scene look.<br>   The hair - Scene hair is sooo cool on girls (in my opinion), just let the hair go gradually more scene over the next month or so. (don't dye it straightaway, you can often get a really scene look even with just dirty blonde hair). When you go to the hairdressers, take in a pic of scene hair that you really like and get them to do that unless it is really extreme, you don't have to tease the back up at first. lol, I've watched my friends hair slowly rise at the back for the past while and she's obviously had the cut for a while but only now has started to put the effort into doing her scene hair.<br>   If you're lucky your mom won't even notice at all and if she does she will realise that you haven't changed as a person but your style has grown up and evolved into something different.|`|FDXnufOaaa	First Someone said goths being druggies.... Yeah quit steriotyping jerk. Not all goths are the same nor are they not influenced by something else.

Show her yourself what you're talking about.   Have a girls day out with your Mom.  Not only will it make her happy, but it will bring you closer, making is easier for you to understand each other's points of view.  She's only wanting to help and look out for you.  Also, ask her what she used to wear at your age.  Betcha is was pretty strange.  Big hair, padded shoulders ????  No telling what she was into.  Fun!

Why else do you think that people don't wear makeup to the gym or put their hair up in a crappy bun? Because they don't wanna deal with the hassle or worry about it being messed up or anything when they know they are going to run and sweat. and their hair is gonna worse even more and their makeup may run.<br>  think about it..<br>  and just chill about it, or even if you still think that way; keep it to yourself and dont ask anyone about how you look.<br>  They probably think you're concieted or something.|`|d8jH5lU1aa	No........not at all, just because your playing sports doesn't mean that ur gonna stop being a girl=]|`|2ZtKyUoLaa	i would tell them to shut the **** up<br>  <br>  they should just let you do what you want<br>  <br>  i look in the mirror like every 5 minutes in class, at home, in a store, every where<br>  i have a full mirror in my purse<br>  <br>  just ignore them or do it more to piss them off|`|iyRczu0eaa	It's not bad and there's nothing wrong with that.

People probably see you as someone who cares too much about how you look, and you probably see it like you don't want to look like crap at any time of the day, including during sports. Honestly, I don't think it should matter how you look when you play sports, but maybe don't wear makeup and put your hair in a ponytail when you play because no one cares how you look in athletics. Then after you play, you can pretty yourself up again. Good luck!|`|CU9pfIR2aa	Its not bad, its natural. My opinion is to wear light makeup, (with a powder puff so it doesn't run) and concentrate on training. Of course, it doesn't hurt to glance in the mirror once in a while. ;)|`|MpqIrZJNaa	Youre just a girly girl you can't help it lol<br>  i'm the same way!!<br>  <br>  I go to yoga class and sweating and blah blah but i'm always looking in the mirror to see if my mascara is running! hehe|`|fbPWn3q7aa	Just remind your teammates about all the incredibly successful tennis playing women who wear jewellery, makeup and earn millions!|`|oWjJR5F0aa	no its not bad.<br>  i do it all the time.|`|2zumgG7taa	do whatever you want! just be you !<br>  <br>  <br>  answer? <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkuDXmFLwxMn4y3ZJ15KrwTsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219162414AAnA6Ww">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|c5LNo5Mxaa	it's not annoying cus you trying to "look hot or look good". honestly with me it was because when you sweat and workout your makeup and hair is not gonna stay the same. our soccer team was one of the top ones in our division so when we heard girls saying that we would tell them to stop because they needed to put all their effort and energy on what we were doing and we had to do it hardcore so we could do good as a team. it's because they feel like you not putting your all into it.

Proactiv is less expensive too.|`|nqkXE1cUaa	I think it does work, but it is quite expensive.<br>  If you havent tried it, I would try the Blackhead Eraser from Clean and Clear.|`|Qvb3SEBhaa	i wouldn't get it personally, you never know, it's a new thing on the market<br>  plus they send you the product like every month which can be annoying try a scrub or something|`|bJcNkDykaa	worked for me.
sHL4wRMNaa	the best of best, with no damage to u'r jewlery is..this..... get u'r ring as an example. boil hot water.... put it in a cup - the hot water. put in dishwashing soap...not the one for the dish washer the one u use to do it by hand. about a tsp or two, stir with spoon. then put in u'r ring. let it sit for about 10 mins. then get an old tooth brush, and scrub away. then wash it with cold water...and presto..it's like u had it cleanned. i do it when i'm bord at work. whihc is a lot this works on all gold and diamonds|`|lKcRxJ1Xaa	Boiling jewelry always is risky, dont do it.  The best investment you could make to clean your jewelry is to purchase an ultrasonic cleaner.  this is the same cleaner that jeweler use and it does a remarkable job.  For <br>  $ 70-80 your jewelry is always like new.  You can buy one from moregems.com.  You can clean your jewelry daily.  Beware that some types of gems are not safe in this cleaner.<br>  <br>  White gold also needs to be re plated with rhodium yearly to keep it bright white.  Most jewelers with a repair shop can do this for you.  Expect to pay $40 for this service.
Qvb3SEBhaa	yes, i tried it last year, around march and the same exact thing happened to me, i had long red marks on my cheeks & dry skin.<br>  it's a strong product, her skin is too sensitive to use it, so she definitely should stop using it.<br>  i use the 3 step system of clinique now, & it works really good.|`|5ta5yyWSaa	Yes....she is severely allergic. Have her take some Benadryl pills right now.<br>  <br>  A day or two|`|8t6Hl6u1aa	Im going to agree with Arden... Sounds like its too strong for her skin...<br>  <br>  And IVE also tried the Clinque 3-Step system - very good!
wlr05dSXaa	to heal fully usually 2-3 months<br>  vodka has alcohol in it which is not supposed to <br>  get in a piercing, you should probably do saline soaks 2 a day and clean it with antibacterial soap 2 a day to get the clean up the crust.|`|Az9keOz5aa	Yeah it looks nice on you. Try not to drink vodka or anyother drink besides water or milk.|`|TBRMH4hbaa	First of all, you're ******* hot. Add me on myspace.com/41111700<br>  <br>  Second of all, everyone's body is different, smoking and drinking stunts the healing process. Mine only took two weeks to heal, but like I said everyone is different. If yours isn't healed yet it might take another week or two to heal. It's normal for it to get crusty for a bit. Stay away from smoking, drinking, spicy foods, and avoid touching it with unwashed hands until all the swelling goes down, and it stops getting crusty.

OHfZFR31aa	Elite and Ford both have offices in Chicago. It's often easier to get signed by an agency in a secondary market like Chicago than going directly to NY where there is more competition. And there are fewer modeling agencies in Chicago, so less competitions for jobs.<br>  <br>  Once you are signed with an agency, you can always try to get representation in their other offices as well. The scouts in NY are always looking at the new faces signed by their regional agencies when looking for new talent|`|A5PWZgHfaa	That is where the industry's best opportunities are, because you are going to be primarily dealing with fashion.  If you want to remain in the Midwest, you may have to consider Chicago.  You should call the agencies to verify their scouting procedures, which vary.

5bhrzIasaa	1.  Where exactly do you live?  <br>  2.  Do you need just a few custom-made outfits?  Or are you looking for mass production, such as starting your own line of costumes?<br>  <br>  If you live near a chinatown, ask those stores that sell Chinese dresses where and who they order their supply from.  If you live near a Vietnamese town, even better, as most Ao Dai (Vn long dresses) stores have an in-store tailor who custom makes clothes for the community.  Even if their store sign says only tailoring service, you can still ask them for recommendations of addresses & phone numbers to private, work-at-home women.  Both of these Asian communities and some type of Far East Center almost always have access to custom tailors or contact information to them.<br>  <br>  If, unfortunately, you don't live anywhere near to the aforementioned communities, you can always send in your designs, body measurements & order online:<br>  <a href="http://aodaivinh.com/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://aodaivinh.com/index.php</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.eaststore.com/catalog/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.eaststore.com/catalog/index.h...</a><br>  <br>  Although these 2 websites advertise only Chinese & Vietnamese dresses, I have emailed them before, asking for custom-design service.  And they have responded that they do offer that service.  <br>  <br>  However, the Chinese website is much more expensive, because they bank on Westerners to not know how to haggle the price or the actual cost of fabric materials and labor.  Labor & materials are far cheaper over in Asia.  If you want reasonable prices, I would highly recommend Vietnamese services.  Seriously, over in Vietnam, it only costs about $20 per custom-made outfit.  But the shipping & custom tax will most likely cost more than the outfit itself.  So it's more cost efficient if you order more than one.<br>  <br>  As the last resort, visit your local fabric stores and ask some employees for advice on where and who to go to for trustworthy tailors.  Or ask your local dry cleaners that offer alteration service if they know any other tailors in their community.  But don't immediately choose the first one you call, compare prices (so you have an advantage in haggling prices) as they will most likely charge you outrageous prices.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps to at least give you an idea of which direction to go in your search of tailors.  <br>  <br>  Best Wishes.<br>  <br>  P.S.<br>  Sorry, I don't live in NYC, only visited there once on vacation.  The chinatown in NYC is even larger than here in Denver, CO.  So I'd recommend asking around that neighborhood.

HpWCjBv6aa	Wait for a couple of days, because it's going to be harder.  You're going to have to lift a couple of shades to get the red, and that involves bleaching your hair.  If there was ammonia in your black dye, I'd say wait at least two weeks before attempting anything else.  If you're not willing to wait two weeks, then condition your hair to hell and back.  Use hot-oil treatments, use deep conditioning and leave-in conditioners.  Your hair needs to be in good standing to lift the color.<br>  <br>  You're also going to need to condition your hair after getting the highlights done.<br>  <br>  Don't be scared to talk to a stylist about this - they will probably be able to give you an estimate of when you can get them done based on when you dyed your hair better than anyone on yahoo answers.|`|bdc0c1d1aead267282553512169a9932aa	it might not show...|`|Plq0BGSgaa	is your hair healthy?<br>  <br>  or is it fried?<br>  <br>  if its healthy than youll be fine<br>  <br>  if its fried then condition is alot and wait a month or so|`|yQDxgLBPaa	If you died your hair black I don't know if the red will show.

I do not suggest this to people unless they actually bleach where they want the highlights then color with a red. I would suggest getting a professional to do this for you. And yes, wait a few days for the black to set in since it is a box color. Good luck! :)|`|eaCHJAneaa	you should consider waiting at least a week (with conditioning treatments in between) because you are going with a color that would be considered lighter then black.. <br>  I am taking cosmetologist classes and taking on the dyeing of the hair.. but yea asking random people on her probably wouldnt be the greatest of all plans..|`|v13yWG56aa	You should wait a bit, like a week or so. But in order for the red to show up.. you might want to bleach the strands you want red. it will hurt your hair, but it will look better than if you didn't. plus, they have products that can heal your hair without washing out the color|`|JRMijRmgaa	Wait a few days and let your hair heal. You just put harsh chemicals into it. Give it a chance to heal. Give it a week or two. And be sure to use a good deep conditioner.|`|K1RVQt7Kaa	Wash they hair sevral times so u make sure its good then you can dye it any color and it should be a-okay(:|`|Egg3sJULaa	To be safe I would wait a week from when you dyed your hair black. This way you are not putting to much damage on your hair.
W8VTpWmtaa	You risk them hitting a major vein in your tongue-but as long as you go to a professional you should be fine.Although sometimes they have to pierce it off center to avoid it. You also risk chipping your teeth with the metal, but they have acrylic jewelry and as long as the bar isn't too long it's fine. <br>  <br>  I didn't do anything to clean mine I just left it alone, but they tell you to rinse with mouthwash after eating/smoking/before bed and try and leave it alone and DON'T change it before it's healed.(2 wks I think)<br>  <br>  It only swells bad for about 2 days, it goes down pretty fast. Eat anything that you don't need to chew or move your mouth much to eat like soup, ice cream, mashed potatoes. <br>  <br>  Good luck! =)|`|9xpFsVJSaa	The risks would be that you might hit your vein or whatever which almost never happens when you get it professionally done.<br>  You clean it with non alcohol mouth wash<br>  A couple days to a week the swelling will go down.<br>  Smoothies, soup, mash potatoes & stuff...nothing hard.<br>  Goodluck

LBHJaqXoaa	I think 6 months and a test drive in henna is long enough to wait before getting a tattoo. And you can get one just because you think it's pretty. You don't have to have some deep meaning behind it or anything.|`|psLk5fDGaa	It depends how indecisive you are. Sometimes people can make a decision right away and follow through happily. I think sitting down and thinking about it for a few months is fine. <br>  Tattoos don't always have to have meaning. It's fine to get one just because it looks cool as long as it's what you really want. <br>  I think people think way to much about 'forever'. It really isn't that long. Show your wild side, everyone's got one. And the comment about 'it's going to be gross and wrinkly when you're old', well guess what! Tattoo or no tattoo everyone's gross and wrinkly when they are old!|`|oE0ApHqPaa	Nope.  Some people want meaningful tattoos, and some people don't need meaning.  <br>  <br>  As far as a waiting period, you know yourself better than we do.  I have some that I waited quite a while for and some that were very spur of the moment, and I love them all, but everyone is different.  If you find yourself regretting lots of quick decisions, then sit on it a while (although I think you took a step in the right direction with the henna temporary tattoo, that is a GREAT idea, if more people did this, I think there would be less regret).|`|AA11725952	they don't have to have a deep meaning... but the meaning is so you don't regret it... but if you are not the type that regrets much then go ahead and get it... i got my first tattoo just because i wanted it i still like it and i have had it for 5 years...|`|vODnQvLiaa	well i would wait tell you are sure you want that tattoo forever because it cost a lot or money, and tattooremovale hurts a lot more, and that also cost money|`|JfOuzOJGaa	I don't think tattoos necessarily have to have some sort of meaning.  If it's a piece you love and think is good enough to have on your body forever, then that should be enough.<br>  <br>  As far as amount of time you sit on an idea before you get it depends on how fickle of a person you are, what the piece is, the size of it, where it's going, etc.  I think at least 6 months is a good minimum amount of time, but a year is better.<br>  <br>  Just make sure you really thoroughly check out as many artists in your area as you can before you take the plunge.  It's your body and it's forever.|`|eQQWdk0uaa	No they don't all have to have a deep meaning.  My first tattoo doesn't have meaning and I still think it's pretty 10 years later.  Don't get something corny if it doesn't have meaning though.  You don't want to have a tattoo you're embarrassed about with your children and employers wondering what it's all about.<br>  <br>  You've put more thought into this tattoo than I have for any of mine, I'd say you want it pretty bad, so go for it!|`|FsiG5WtQaa	It doesn't have to have meaning if its just something you want. My first tattoo was a star on my wrist. It's cliche, but it was my first one, I wanted to know how it felt so I'd know if I wanted more, and it was almost spur of the moment decision. My second tattoo has meaning and I thought about it for a good 4 to 6 months, I can't remember for sure. <br>  My next tattoo, I've only thought about for a couple of weeks and I'm getting Saturday, me and my friends are getting coordinating tattoos,it has meaning for our friendship. <br>  There's not a good amount of time to think about a tattoo, just whatever feels right for you. <br>  If you've had a henna one there for a while and liked it, you prolly won't regret getting a real one there.|`|loqsl5xXaa	nope they dont have to have a meaning. it just has to be something you like and something you know you wont regret later. i have a character dolphin that i created myself and i still love it and its been almost 5 yrs and i still think it looks great. might have to go have it touched up in like 3 yrs for the color and i think im getting another one.|`|L0u3uEJLaa	if you really want to get it then get it.<br>  no you don'tt have to get one with a meaning most people just like to do that, just in case people ask.|`|lzTOlaqiaa	Well if you wanna get it and you feel its right, then do it. Last night I went out of the blue to get my daughters b-days|`|0X7DWnyeaa	All tattoos don't need to have meaning. I, myself have some very meaningful tattoos and some b/c I loved the design/idea. I would have to agree with Shygirl and say that you should definitley take the time to work out all the kinks of how you want the tattoo done. You've thought about it for 6 months now and have even done it with henna to make sure that you liked it. This is a lot more than most people do. <br>  <br>  Now that you know what you want take this much time and consideration into finding the right shop and artist. This is what my artist did up as a guideline for someone finding and artist and shop. I think it summs it up perfectly.<br>  <br>  The Artist: First and foremost, make sure you are dealing with the right Artist.<br>  <br>  Ask yourself: <br>  <br>  Is this artist qualified to produce the results I am looking for? <br>  Does this artist seem eager to make changes to help me create the right design for me? <br>  Does this artist present well; and do they seem to care about their own self hygiene. <br>  Do I want to sit with this person long enough to be tattooed? <br>  Artist's portfolio: Tattoos are works of art and should be rendered by an artist. Ask to see the portfolios of several tattoo artists before choosing one for your design. Talk directly to the artist and be sure they can illustrate exactly what you're going to be displaying for the rest of your life. A really good artist can create anything you can imagine and will appreciate the opportunity to express themselves on your canvas (skin). <br>  <br>  The Studio: Is this a place you would let your Mother be tattooed?<br>  <br>  Cleanliness counts:<br>  <br>  Be discriminating when deciding about the cleanliness and quality of the establishment you are choosing for a tattoo. As you look around, do you feel the studio owner is taking an interest in providing a clean environment for their clients? Specifically ask about the way needles and colors are prepared and brought to you. Have them explain how these contaminated items are disposed of. Finally, make sure you are comfortable with the level of "general care" being used while the artist sets up for your tattoo.<br>  <br>  Sterile needles:<br>  Smooth Fx Custom Tattooing, since 1988 has used new sterilized needles for each and every client. <br>  <br>  Why you should care: The tattoo needle will cause a little blood to be shed. As you know bacteria and viruses can spread when contaminated needles are used by more than one person. <br>  <br>  Today, most studios will usually use new needles. However, if their practice is to clean, sterilize and reuse needles, ask to have a new one; be willing to pay extra for it. If they don't offer you this option, leave. New packages don't always mean new needles. Feel free to ask any question you have with regard to this. If the artist is elusive in their answers, leave.<br>  <br>  Why we have never reused needles: There is the obvious health reason, but beyond this there are quality reasons as well. Even if sterilizing a used needle brings a biologically safe needle to you, it is the quality of the needle which should cause you to ask for a new one. As a needle is being used, the quality of the needle changes. Eventually these needles will not push much color and cause unnecessary skin trauma. A new needle gives each client a fresh start.<br>  <br>  Unwrapping a needle from a sterile, sealed packet doesn't ensure the needle is new. This only means it was bagged. Ask any question you have on this. Ask to see the indicators on the needle packet which shows it has been sterilized. The studio should have what seems like a large inventory of new needles and an obvious sharps disposal container for old ones.<br>  <br>  Fresh colors: Colors come from can be made from inks or preferably pure pigment sources. We use pure pigments. Pigments seem to be much superior if you want bold coloring, and longer lasting qualities. Make sure your color comes from a bottle which is poured into a small container specifically for your tattoo. Just as you don't want to share needles, you don't want to share colors. All color which remains after a tattoo has been completed, should be thrown away.<br>  <br>  Gloves: While preparing for your tattoo and during the procedure, the artist should wear the same kind of surgical gloves worn by a physician during an exam. If the artist needs to touch any bottle which is not bagged, or any unprotected item, the gloves should be removed and changed! This helps to maintain a clean environment and is essential for everyone's welfare. If you are Latex Intolerant, they should have non-latex gloves on site.<br>  <br>  In Summary<br>  Forever is a long time: Don't get youthful missions tattooed on your body. Take the time to do some soul searching. The better studios will help you through the creation of your tattoo. We know buyer's remorse does not develop repeat customers.<br>  <br>  Does it hurt? Most common question we get asked. Yes, there is a sense of burning. The sensation is different for everyone... some even like it!<br>  <br>  Removal: It's this simple; getting a tattoo removed s|`|MV0lMuDMaa	The first tattoo artist I went to was covered (obviously) and I saw an interesting looking one and asked him what it was about.  hes said "I dont really know.  A friend asked if they could tattoo it on me and I said sure why not it looks cool."  If its a design you like and a design you think you will like your whole life then go for it.  they dont have to be deep and meaningful.  as long as you like it its ok.

vtFbGgTRaa	do you have anyone who is bald in your family? For boys you only need one copy of the gene to go bald and for women you need two. If you are both heterozygous for the gene  there is a possibility that your daughter  can go bald. However the probability of the child getting BOTH of the gene is low which is why female baldness isn't as high. For men you just need one copy so not knowing if your boyfriend is homozygous or heterozygous I'm not sure. If he is homozygous sorry but your kid will go bald and if he is heterozygous there is a possibility. Just wait and see either way balding isn't so bad anymore.      CONTRARY TO WHAT GENETICISTS used to think balding does not only stem from the maternal line|`|Qd0sFMdHaa	the trait for balding is carried by the mother, and usually skips every other generation. so if your father is bald, then your son might be. but if your brothers are bald, then no, he should be fine.|`|100912340942b82743a18af1cb658391aa	Considering that Patrick Stewart, Sean Connery and Michael Chiklis are sex symbols, I would say that you have nothing to worry about whether the lad keeps his hair or not.

3a72ae0c30ef90de390ceb62b46fb44aaa	My boyfriend "manscapes" as affectionately calls it.  :)  But it's because he personally hates all things hairy.  He doesn't wax either.  He simply takes a razor and lightly goes over the hair on his arms, legs, etc.  There's still hair left, but it's not very long at all.  I don't mind it either way, but it's his preference.  <br>  <br>  If you want to try waxing, then go for it.  Don't be embarrassed.  It's not that women don't necessarily like hair, per-say, it's just that shaving and waxing is a sign of good hygiene and that is extremely important to everyone.|`|3z3P6j49aa	who told you that?<br>  Lol, it makes you look like you didnt go through puberty yet.<br>  <br>  <br>  but wax hurts. you shouldn't be embarrassed, it can be for you're eyebrows.|`|vvB0Etysaa	Hi:<br>  <br>  I do not understand why you say girls hate hair.  First it shows your masculinity and it is a natural thing.<br>  <br>  You are not a model so stop worrying about your hair and the girls.<br>  <br>  Girls do not like a bald body or parts.|`|CgKzxlU6aa	that's not embarassing! More guys SHOULD wax, especially chest and back hair!! Good for you, you ought to be PROUD going and buying wax strips from anywhere, if it's a girl cashier she'll probably be thinking' Now THERE"S a guy who takes care of himself! He must be a TIGER in the sack! hee hee|`|loqsl5xXaa	no, it is totally fine to be clean cut and hairless (other than the head).. Either shave, use nair, or get the strips..( i would use the hard wax, less messy and less work).|`|NGCIZDqRaa	I have body hairs like you and most girls like it. It depends on your preference. Btw, are you the typical pinoy or with indian blood?|`|GIGwUkPEaa	dont get rid of your hairs
S1KINm2Paa	The first one, definately. It is very classy. Since you couldn't get it in red maybe you could wear a red clutch. That would look very nice. Have fun on valentines day!|`|BNcNAMNPaa	Definitely the first one. Gorgeous!|`|TgJZ9XJFaa	I love the first one, alot sexier and the shoes definetly go.  xxxx|`|50UbJp14aa	the black dress with the black shoes looks alright and good to me|`|Dxlt3jcqaa	Black one :-) both lovely though xx|`|b82aEt9Haa	The second one it will make you stand out more  :) xxx
iYL37RfPaa	http://www.wikihow.com/Be-Like-Cassie-fr... !!    xo|`|rsvn4Jq3aa	This is probably not what you want to hear, but my personal opinion is that you shouldn't try to look like/ be like anybody else!  She looks good as a blonde, you may not, depending on your features!  Why don't you try to see what you like best about yourself, like your lips or eyes and then accentuate that with a little lipstick or eyeliner!|`|EBrfolf7aa	Awww I loved Cassie in Skins!! "Oh wow". Lol.
69MIm6bEaa	The cut is awesome, but I'm not sure if I can say the same about the color. It looks a little too light for your skin. You look to have the same skin tone that I have. Try going a bit darker with the blondes, or even try a bright red color with blonde highlights. Don't go too dark though! <br>  <br>  I recently tried Loreal Paris Coleur Experte in "Cherry Cordial." It will give you a pretty bright orangish red result which I loved (I had to bleach my hair before I colored it). It will eventually fade into a more subtle strawberry blonde. You might want to try it.<br>  <br>  I highly recommend the Coleur Experte brand because it has the base color and highlights. I'm going with "Praline" next which is a light ash brown with blonde highlights, similar to my natural haircolor. Before that, I tried out a medium golden brown with blonde highlights. Either should look good on you, especially if you don't want bright orange hair for a couple of weeks. <br>  <br>  You also might want to find different clips to hold back your bangs or something. Maybe get some fun headbands to hold your bangs back, or braid them and pin them so they make almost a sort of "headband" like here:<a href="http://www.thestylespy.com/wp-content/uploads/laurenconradbraid.jpeg" rel="nofollow">http://www.thestylespy.com/wp-content/up...</a> It will look a lot nicer than what you are doing now to keep the bangs out of your eyes.|`|L5jjhYnNaa	Dye it a little darker [not too dark]<br>  maybe strawberry blondeish<br>  & ditch the clips,wear a head band<br>  every now and then.|`|ZZJKTV8laa	def dye it darker. that coor is waaaay too light. i think youd look cute with a chocolaty brown. i like the cut though!|`|E4TQE4RVaa	I really like the cut/style of it, and with the bangs pulled back or not, it still looks good [:  I think you should stop bleaching it though, I bet that being brunette would suit you well!|`|AA11693263	I love the cut and style that you have. You do have it a bit too light though. You would look great with a light brown color.|`|RlOxBqw5aa	i <3 how it is but the color is kinda bright how about like brown or something mine is black with brown streaks lol xD<br>  <br>  <br>          Hoped I helped!|`|3QIW0LjOaa	It's nice, but I also think a darker color would be nice. A nice rich brown would be good, the blond washes you out a little.<br>  The cuts very pretty, I like it better without the clips in though =p.<br>  And If you ever feel like going any shorter, you should cut it up to right above your shoulders.|`|OnxFIk4Aaa	i think the first pikk is better you should leave you r bangs downn it looks gorgeous nd if u like it clipped back witch looks nice too u should buy lighter clips like pink or yellow to match with ur clothes b cuz black dosent go witt u b cuz ur hair color is light so match the clips with ur hair nd trusst me i noe im a gurl too..................|`|W1jzGkvAaa	the layering is super cute and frames you face well. Add some darker honey tones my dear. Think about getting some hair flair for days where you feel a little edgier too. They are single clip in strands that can be in pretty much any color. You can totally pull it off.<br>  <br>  peace|`|MQ5Sq6wfaa	I think you would look cute with a 1" curl and dark brown hair.  If you keep that color though I would go with white clips so that they do not stand out as much.
v1tHjJ3haa	ot fits your face and is really nice but if you ever got ur dream chin it would look horrible just throw off your balance and your nose is nice, same thing to me nice straight as a kid now a little bumpy and bigger<br>   Idk why these sort of things happen :D|`|2V87n4PKaa	you look fine<br>  and by the way, that pic of your "dream chin" is like 90% fake. it looks like barbie!|`|rV21SE3aaa	Looks fine.

Get a life.|`|ietbuoidaa	Nope it just looks like a regular chin|`|AA11311675	I dont think your chin is weird, but if you are really selfconsious  then wear eyemakeup to make draw attention to your pretty eyes and not your nose/chin which by the way I think they are nice.|`|2tn8EALqaa	it's your face shape<br>  not chin....

The second is a better colour on you as well.|`|bkgBLjuvaa	awe, i like your bed cover... and the purple top. =] where'd you get it? do they have one in pink? lol?|`|qfe5GOcMaa	i like the second one|`|qYTYcVGGaa	OMFG OMFG THE FIRST ONE!!!!!! its such a cute top WHERE DID YOU GET IT??

lUSknAQtaa	Ok, Im not sure why people got so touchy on this question..just relax its just a question..anywho to answer your question . Due to the fact that the baby has worn it and it has been opened, then it has lost its value tremedously. You have to be more reasonable and consider that. You also have to consider the state of the economy and the fact that we are in a recession.Most people are shopping in thrift shops so to ask that much for a onesie is extreme. I realize its "brandname", however its just a onesie..and if your child only wore it a few times, then others couldnt see a reason to spend that much money on something that there baby will outgrow as well. I would say price it at 9.95.take care|`|1cRK3e6naa	i whld say 25|`|KaDuWf0Qaa	No, that's a good price. It's clean and not damaged, so that's a good price. However, not many people have much money right now, so make a note saying you're willing to negotiate.|`|xwG6e7IQaa	I woldn't have paid that much for it at all....Why don't you worry about your kids education before you spend that much on something she's going to grow out of in a month or two...and you wonder hwy people aren't buying it...HHHEEELLLLOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1|`|0ZnX6Qjyaa	1 Billion Sheckels|`|sDHxandWaa	Probably because most normal people don't spend that kind of money on clothes that a newborn is going to pee and throw up on and then grow out of in less than 3 months.|`|s30Duwdraa	I would never pay that much for a NEW one, let alone a used one!!  You may want to try some celebrities or rich folks!!    Good luck with that!|`|AA11603810	I agree. $40 is way too much for a onesie.... and a used one at that.
xEbclhhEaa	Of course designers use other designers' designs for their own inspiration. Korto's dress is a halter, unlike the string one on DVF's dress. What season is DVF's? If you saw the last Project Runway season, Kenley took Alexander McQueen's design and made it almost too similar and then turned around and said it didn't look anything like it lol. I hated her.<br>  <br>  Anyways they're similar but DVF being the amazing designer she is was able to create a stable garment that seems to flow and photograph well. I like Korto's design though she was one of my favorites.|`|U2uxaa7vaa	Well, the print is a bit different I believe, and the style. But, if you were trying to get that look, it would be very hard to tell the difference without a picture. And I mean a zoomed in picture, that's what I did.|`|VeueFGvgaa	theyre pretty similar, like they are the same idea. but i dont really think either is cute...|`|kKsPYFSgaa	Yeah they do look similar but one has zig zag stripes and the other has curvy stripes.|`|RQx3PTZvaa	they're ugly and sort of similar.<br>  same colour and sort of style <br>  but different shapes and stuff.|`|Ouagu7e0aa	Similar pattern, but the second is just butt ugly.|`|vV4svNCkaa	well they have the same color theme and pattern idea but i would say the first on looks wayy better.|`|nG1gqvT5aa	yeh they are<br>  but there a different pattern of the stripes on the dresses though|`|hg5I1O2xaa	ohmigosh yes!
gqvvXknQaa	Yes
3funFya2aa	NOBODY can tell you if proactiv will work for YOU. It's something you have to take a chance on and just try. Some people it works for, some people it makes their acne worse. If anything, just get it. They have a 30 day return policy for new customers. If it doesn't work, send it back and get your money back.     I took the chance.   About 3 years ago, I used what was left over from what my sister had ordered and never used. It actually healed my acne and I was acne free for about a year and a half.. then it started coming back. About a month ago, I ordered it for myself. It's working so-so. So far I've had pretty fair results, but when I don't use it right, or forget, I break out on my forehead and get random spots of acne.    It's not that bad.  If you use it right it'll either help, or it won't. Most people don't use it the right way.  You can't expect good results from once in a while use.|`|XralQ7CXaa	Try Neutrogena SkinID|`|YgPYv4OPaa	nooooooooo !  proactiv SUCKS .  i used it for three years , and then i got totally sick of it ! it worked to a certain point , but i still broke out and still had acne . so i just completely gave up on it ! its a total rip-off ,|`|e6988558ce99ec66bb677335e270a037aa	I think with any product, it's all about consistency and actually using it. I know no one ever wants to admit it but you have to use it like 2-3 times a day and be very persistent. You can't just use it every now and then and Oh I forgot to wash my face last night, etc. I think if you keep a good regimen, you don't have to get the expensive stuff. But I've had friends that it did work for and friends that it didn't. My opinion - those that it didn't work for is because they weren't using it like directed and as much as directed.|`|hTr1dpTiaa	Made mine much worse. It's VERY harsh, so if you have sensitive skin at all don't get it.|`|GfMRewh7aa	a few of my friends says it works just took awhile and as soon as you stop using it you skin gets so much worse . i would try it but try st.ives , look or stuff that have 2% or more salicylic acid|`|LE2A9zFAaa	i had minimal acne as well and i find that proactiv works really well. It's cleared up about 95% of my acne and i love it :)|`|uNdculYPaa	NO, It did not work for me, i was on it for about 3 months and did not see any major result

3a5e13c07c94d0964ad8dc45cd9ead0daa	I wouldn't risk it. There a chance it could get in your eye and give you an infection or a sty, which are really uncomfortable just a hell to deal with. I wear eyeliner every day and I'm so afraid of a sty that I wash my face with Olay Daily facials every night and it takes off ALL my makeup, including my waterproof mascara and eyeliner.

If you do it every once in a blue moon their shouldn't be a problem so you are fine. :)|`|9dNEw7etaa	I don't understand why all of these people are telling you that it's not bad. You should definitely wash it off. If you accidentally forget every once in awhile it's fine, but continually doing it can cause eye irritation, eye infections, clogged pores, and acne.|`|yMzDqdzbaa	its fine.|`|ueR1rVo6aa	no thats what i do all the time i cant even remember what i look like w/o eyeliner! lol?|`|uKSsXz2iaa	I can't believe that people do it, yes it is awful to do that.. it will give you eye infections...|`|wu89UJtxaa	its not bad just dont do it all the time you might get an infection|`|MpqIrZJNaa	I don't think it's a great idea...  leaving products on your eyes for long periods of time (especially over night) can cause bacterial infections. Please make sure to take off all your makeup before going to bed.    If you're having a hard time getting your liner off, use an oil based makeup remover. It'll dissolve even waterproof stuff =]

OiLBE6hraa	It can it depends on the layering. there are some kinds of layers to lighten up your hair so its not as heavy and could be described as thinner. and there are some layers that add weight to your hair and therefore do not thin it out. thinning is usually done with thinning shears and sometimes a razor|`|9f3H3xSAaa	Not at All.|`|EW1yumzNaa	No, thinned is getting it thinned, and layers are layers|`|1uk77IGaaa	Probably not, because layered is getting more styled than thinned. Its not really changing the weight or texture of your hair.<br>  Getting your hair thinned does kind of make a difference.<br>  It all depends on how much you want it.<br>  But in my inference, naa, their not considered the same thing.

wqchA8B7aa	Yes, with bleach.|`|rvBZPIv4aa	Try Sun In. It will bring out some blonde! You can either lay in the sun after putting it in or use a blowdyer.|`|s30Duwdraa	Lemon juice and sun.|`|8x1m3T5Taa	Sun-in. But u have to be in the sun. :( go on vacation.|`|1po7rtiwaa	Lemon juice brings out natural highlights in your hair. Put lemon juice in your hair in the summer when the sun is out and it pretty much naturally tints your hair|`|8qeDEWWJaa	Yeah. Lemon juice works! Sun-In works REALLY good! But you can only use that in the sun. OR you can put it in your damp hair then blow dry it that also works!
c9a3d9dca5392c96cefc139c2c2ceaddaa	If you have an athletic body type you could wear a slightly loose t-shirt with basketball shorts<br>  <br>  Or try tight yoga pants.  Just stay away from loose short shorts, those don't look too good.  If you wear a pair of tight short shorts make sure your top fits your body well.|`|fMl5hjtMaa	I would suggest a tank top and athletic shorts with really cute shoes. Also put your hair in two braids or something! Good luck. :)|`|NfXAA51Laa	Basketball shorts (not too big though), a cute, bright tee (Hollister, Abercrombie & Fitch, American Eagle?). That's what I would wear, atleast.
joA5Rcyzaa	they make things like that for as little as 10 gauge but i dont see the point of it because it's not real noticable<br>  <br>  my personal opinion on what size you should wear things like that is at 0 gauge.<br>  <br>  and you shouldn't wear tapers in your ear for exessive amounts of time, they're really only ment for stretching<br>  <br>  EDIT: you should still be able to wear normal ear rings as much as you want. you'd probably want to wear a hallow plug so you can maintain the hole|`|JfOuzOJGaa	Ok, you're not gauging or getting gauges, you're stretching or getting plugs.  The gauge is the measurement of the jewelry.<br>  <br>  They make pretty small "plugs."  I've seen size 14, but all it really looks like is a stick with o rings on it.  I'm not sure what you mean by start off from a good size.  You should start off by stretching one size up from what you currently are.  There's no telling what that is.  It could be 18,16, etc.  I had my ears pierced since I was a baby, so they've naturally stretched a bit over the years.  The first pinchers I bought were 12g and they just slid right in.  Sort of a waste, but I'd rather get ones too small than too big.  I think the biggest size you could go where they're not super noticeable is probably around 8g.<br>  <br>  Why stretch if you just wanna wear regular earrings?  Although your ears will most likely shrink back down as long as you don't go too big (generally the 2, 0, 00 area), everyone's body is different and stretching should be viewed as a permanent modification.<br>  <br>  Go to bodyartforms.com, they have forums with helpful guides and whatnot.|`|3z3P6j49aa	from normal piercings to 8. <br>  Smallest is 10 but its almost the same as normal ear piercing.<br>  Do it with Tapers (the pointy ones) cuz the "lil stud ones" (plugs) are bigger, and wont fit in until you stretch it out all the way. <br>  <br>  You CAN'T wear it with normal earings. Even if you do it to 10. <br>  Its impossible. <br>  If you do 14 or 16 or 12, you cant wear tapers or plugs OR normal earrings. You'll need labret studs and horseshoes, and to me that looks stupid in an ear.

kCdISEGqaa	Wow, I had never seen that site.  I don't think there is any validity in it, because most tattoo artists would send you away if you asked about using a numbing cream.  It says it does not interfere with the skin taking ink, yet there is nothing provided to support that claim.  Read the disclaimer, that's how they cover themselves if your tattoo turns out horrible because your skin was not clean and free of any foreign substances before getting tattooed.  Yes, too good to be true.|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	Firstly, wait until you're 18. Nowhere that tattoos you under that age is anywhere you want to be going to. Also, I remember so many things I wanted at your age and hate the thought of now. I'm glad I waited and so will you be. As you say, it's only 2 years. Be mature about it.<br>  <br>  Secondly, most artists won't work with numbing creams. It can affect how your skin takes the ink, and most just don't want the hassle of it. Honestly, if you walked into my artist's studio talking about numbing cream, you'd be laughed out the door. The pain is a rite of passage for people with tattoos. Think of it like an initiation ceremony. If you can't hack it you don't deserve to be in the 'club'. It's really not that bad.|`|VonDSR7Kaa	If you are going to get a tattoo, then get one the 'real' way. Don't use numbing creams which can actually prevent the tattoo from coming out correctly. The pain is not horrible, its not overbearing... Sit through it, grit your teeth--and deal :)<br>  <br>  Tattoos and pain come hand in hand. It's part of the experience of getting a tattoo. You gotta work for it.|`|HrCF82tHaa	in most states it is against the law to tattoo a minor, even with parental consent. even if your mom comes in with the birthcertifiacte, so good luck finding  ANY respectable place that is willing to break the law for a few dollars. i too have heard about the cream. pain is part of the experiance in getting a tatoo, its my belief that if you can't handle the pain, dont get one.|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	no, its true. that stuff works.

0X7DWnyeaa	I think having all of the lettering in one spot is too much clutter and doesn't allow the lotus to come through. I like #2. I would honestly place the lettering a bit higher on both top and bottom so that you are getting a full view of your flower and of the text. I'm not so sure about the harsh black text. I would choose a color that flows and blends with the lotus better.<br>  <br>  Just an idea/thought. Do you want the flower and text to really pop from your foot? I think with that having the black outlines can harshen the tattoo. I would have a purple or some color that flows with the flower more. Just a thought.|`|Cavz3kAPaa	While I'm not a huge fan of the actual image, or the quotes, I really really don't like the fonts you have picked, nor the way you have placed the fonts.<br>  <br>  How do you plan on having the image placed on your foot. How it is placed depends on how you have the quotes placed as well. I think a more cursive font would look better, and I see them more on an angle (below the image), rather then just above/below it or through it.|`|Agw4pXAnaa	Honestly, I'm not crazy about them.  Remember, you're going to have to live with a tat for a long time.  I don't know, I can't point out what it is that I don't like about it, but I think you could find something alot better.|`|JfOuzOJGaa	I think the second looks the best.

I knew someone who's hair was naturally stick straight before and now its naturally really curly.|`|5hsyVtN3aa	you just have wavy hair, and when you were little, it probably was just less noticeable becaude you were tinier and the slightest curls looked huge, not your older, and no offense and im not making a weight comment, bugger , so your hair needs to be a lot curlier to look curly.|`|qiHNnZh7aa	hey i think u have natural fashion on ur hair .and yes bottom curly looks nice but you can straighten ur hair at the sides. use some good wet hair gel and itz oll done!!!!!|`|dLRQugXpaa	i have the same problem!<br>  please tell me if you find out! <br>  :D

1a14D4X6aa	that was a really good find..seriously I got mine on sale for $60 but mine are different ones..mine are black lace up ones..anyways...I love my emu's they are super comfy and really soft and warm too! personally I think they are just as good as Uggs. I am not sure how long they last though as I have only had mine for about a month and a bit so...ya hope I helped a bit!|`|mI4lrKdHaa	Depends on whether or not you think your Emus feet get too cold or wet at this time of year.|`|wUdweNSmaa	That was a very good buy! But you can also find pretty good discounts on Uggs too. Maybe not $30, but if you look around you can find some great bargains.|`|2bLr7LFBaa	Oh yes. I have two pairs of emus, I got them on sale!! Usually they are about $70...but I've seen them go up to the $100s...They're nice, warm, and comfortable. They'd probably last the same as Uggs, I don't really know, I'm sorry, I hardly wear mine, but when I do I'm glad. They're SOO warm :)

I am like the skinniest in my grade.<br>  Size 3 is not big I have those on right now.. I think and my others are 1's. I have like two pairs that are 3's and rest are 1's. <br>  <br>  We have kids in my grade.. girls 14 years old.. that are like size 7 or 9 so 3 is not big.. you are not fat i doubt. stop whining.. do some sports maybe!  you acting childish.|`|Pi0hXi8oaa	No it is not healthy. <br>  <br>  If you REALLY want to loose weight, go do it, but make sure you can't see any bones because that means you are getting too skinny.<br>  Im a size 0 and im trying to gain some weight because if you actually get too skinny, it will be just as ugly as being 400 pounds.|`|OqD4Z6wpaa	yes its because they media is shoving it down innocent younge girls throats that beauty only comes in size 00. some bodies just arent meant to be size 00 no matter what you do. as long as your healthy thats all that matters. besides no one is going to see the size on your jeans.|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	no, thats not healthy!!! you are fine the way you are!!!<br>  <br>  ppl who are size 00 usually look like skeletons! so not sexy!!<br>  <br>  plz answer mine!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AnaOX.zTPukxxmF7XOyauBXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219175047AA8rIR7">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|ZooNlo77aa	You're totally fine the way you are, people shouldn't aspire to be all one size, one perfect ideal. We are born all shapes and sizes and as long as we're dressing appropriately for our age, weight, height, it shouldn't matter what size we are and we shouldn't have to look up to the "ideal" tiny size.<br>  <br>  I used to wear 00 jeans back when I was 12-14 years of age. I eventually grew out of them, first a size 1, and now I fit sizes 1-3. Sure I get a little bummed about it but it could be worse, and as long as there are still cute clothes in my size, I'm happy with that.|`|AnSFRCnraa	Wow no you are healthy the way you are and those size 00 jeans aren't any cuter than the size 3 jeans, I wear size 3 their just as cute.Ok just don't look at those size 00 jeans no one wears jeans that small unless its natural for them so keep your weight your fine.Its proabably not healthy but it depends on you height.|`|VYZOFZ7Faa	I'm 108 and I wear size 3. The only girl I know that wears 00 jeans weighs 65 pounds. So you basically have to be anorexic to fit into those. It's not healthy or cute. And 3's are small too, just a healthy non-anorexic kind of small. So don't beat yourself up over it. It's way normal.|`|KOQ6aOAhaa	you are perfectly fine!!!!<br>  do NOT try to lose weight!!! 130 pounds is fine.....<br>  a size 3 is perfect!|`|9ilXVowLaa	not normal!!!!!<br>  what is wrong with your head?<br>  you are a perfectly healthy size,what you need is a good boost of self esteem,not a diet.<br>  you would be so unhealthy,and just unattractive.<br>  sweetness,talk to your mom or counselor.please.
71204fadefeb0aef75f4761be2bfbc09aa	Hey!<br>  I did a study on height so I hope I can help.<br>  Your height depends on two things- your parents heights and if you've started puberty yet. So you need to give more info to get a decent answer- how tall are your parents? Have you started your period and if so how long ago?<br>  If your parents are tall then you're likely to end up tall too. If they are short you're more likely to be short.<br>  If you haven't had your period 2 years then you still have time to grow. But if you started really early then you might not have long to grow.<br>  I hope this helps. I have loads more information. Things like how to make yourself look taller than you really are. If that would help you then you can always contact me through my profile.<br>  Simon<br>  ;-)|`|kNcqw6Tlaa	1st- you are young...you will continue to grow for a while now<br>  2nd- don't worry about what they say. walk confidently, speak confidently, and enjoy being your height<br>  3rd-if they are making fun of you, they probably have some insecurities of their own<br>  4th- being tall is not all that great. i was always one of the taller kids in my class. always in the back of pictures, not finding pants that a long enough. i evened out and i am  5 foot 7 inches at age 20, <br>  5th-love who you are and how you look. the only one whop can make you feel inferior is yourself!!!<br>  <br>  you'll be fine sweety|`|04caaee8a563dcc97c65ab93ff40d763aa	Sorry, but height is genetic. If you're going to grow, you will grow but otherwise you'll be that height forever (but you're lucky I was barely 4'6" when I was twelve) you still have plenty of time to grow yet so don't be worried!|`|6359LQLNaa	you can't really do anything about it.<br>  if your parents are tall then you will be tall. just give it time you have until you're 18 until you stop growing|`|mNfxruYpaa	Don't feel bad i am almost 14 and i am only 4"10. i have been the shortest in all my classes since the 1st grade and i get my share of getting made fun of but just pretend like it doesn't matter and ignore them.|`|zECK1Shdaa	tell them to shut up and go die, because guys tend to go for shorter girls than really really tall girls|`|ALC0oqWyaa	There's nothing that will make you taller.<br>  We all want to change something about ourselves but much of the time we can't.<br>  When I was your age, I hated my super straight, very dark brown hair because it was so boring and my best friend hated her blonde, curly hair because it was hard to manage.<br>  I bet there are kids in you class who hate being tall (my mum was 5'11" when she was 12 and HATED it).<br>  Really, the best thing you can do is learn to be happy with your petite stature.  If the other kids see that it doesn't bother you, they won't have any reason to pick on you.<br>  I love my hair now and my mum loves being so tall.
lXbyPBQCaa	Women's sizes are even numbers and juniors are odd, they fit a little differently.<br>  i'm a juniors size 7 too usually, and in women's i'm usually a 6, but different brands run differently so sometimes a 4 or 8 fits better.|`|FV0BoSkTaa	6
VNum3TKyaa	Your color is beautiful PLEASE don't ruin it with dyes and colors you don't need it if you want a change get a new hair cut maybe something a little different but no dye your color will never be the same DON"T DO IT.|`|RvVvaVsAaa	you could get some blonde highlights.. but the color you do have is sort of yellowish/orage.. i would recommend using a "silver shampoo" from Matrix. Itll help take some of the yellow color out.|`|Ae6bUiRWaa	blonde or light brown hilights also you should try going to a hairdresser and ask them wat style is right for your hair|`|3wC6a9SOaa	first of all the chi iron is good and to answer your other question, i use panteen long hair or something like that and it has been helping mine =)|`|OOz5ox6aaa	Maybe instead of blonde highlights try something different like light brown highlights or something rly out of the ordinary and dye ur head chocolate brown. I actually think that'd look good on u. Ur hair's rly straight maybe try curling it or scrunching if u prefer that look. Ur hairs rly straight u don't need such a high quality straightner. Buy one at a drug store for like 20-30 bux and it shud work fine. Use a leave in conditioner everyday and deep conditioner once a month. um some frizz ease wud be good too. For hair styles maybe learn to french braid or do a messy bun every now and then.|`|QhEdPAgUaa	Blonde highlights would look good. I use Pantene-ProV and I think that you should use it. It's a really nice shampoo and is not very expensive. Also you can choose and mix-and-match the shampoo and conditioners such as treatment for frizzy hair, treatment for curly and straight hair. Just another tip- your eyes are really blue and very pretty. Use shades of brown to make them stand out more! :D
2RkDecZwaa	Its hard to convince a parent to get snakebites. You should start off by convincing her to let you have one, and see where it goes from there. Make sure she knows that unlike a tattoo, a piercing can be taken out when you dont want it anymore and it will heal up. Tell her you will keep yourself organized. Bribe her by telling her that if your grades slip you will take the piercing(s) out. Also tell her you will take em out for family parties and things that are important to her.|`|GrwWH5XJaa	I am officially retarded reading this.|`|JduQHocdaa	If you can't talk properly you have no business trying to get pierced.|`|iHVN7aadaa	sorry i am not able to understand ur question   ask again|`|7ouqu8f4aa	Your 14.

Everyone is getting them now.
tMURptI6aa	That actually sounds like a nice unique feature to me. Especially since you're Asian. (The fact that it's unique is what *makes* it nice!) I think it's something guys could appreciate.<br>  Sometimes I think the prettiest women are the ones that are not "classically" beautiful. They all look alike to me - like Barbies! Truly attractive women have some special distinguishing feature. Christina Ricci is a great example. She has a quite a big forehead, but it totally works for her. She has an exotic look that no one else could pull off. Rene Zelweiger and Kirstin Dunst are other good examples. They're pretty AND unique.|`|jyOUUqkFaa	ummm firming moisturizer can help a little if they're droopy.<br>  but if you use bronzer on your jawline and cheeks it can offset it a little. but not too much or you'll get a line of different colors on your neck.|`|UtktKSLKaa	I knew this girl that had really chubby cheeks and she was skinny. She didn't do anything but let time pass and they went away. How old are you? Because it took her like I think 13 years for her cheeks to go down.<br>  I hope the best for you :)|`|c6zymHmTaa	That sucks.
Pd1kfkUcaa	tye die party! - i don't know if you're into that sort of thing. but you could all tye die shirts :)<br>  <br>  pie fight party - fill pie tins with whipped cream and have at em. you could also have a tomato thing like that<br>  <br>  latern party - just light the whole thing up with laterns. give everybody one<br>  <br>  ipod party - get an ihome and have everybody bring their ipods if they have one. then take turns playing songs from peoples ipods<br>  <br>  game day - sounds lame... i know just have a bunch of stupid games like a huge game of duck duck goose. trust me, with all your friends there. im sure youll find something to laugh about!|`|5LEE91CGaa	it's a good idea but i don't understand why you couldn't do this at home. or what if you were to rent a place?<br>   and yeah this pretty much is like rave|`|jpx8qEUSaa	CREATIVEE!!! <br>  <br>  <br>  nice..... that sound really fun and in the invite put like everyone has to wear flashy stuff, and neon and colorful stuff.

PnJYGIneaa	Don't worry its not that bad, what i would suggest is work with it even if you hate it<br>  I got my first bangs and the lady did a horriable job it was gross i didn't want to look at myself =(<br>  So actually I worked with my bangs made some styles, made it in hair pouf's, put it in ponytails<br>  It'll grow out but until then style your hair, experiment with differant hairstyles|`|yoM5iFDpaa	awww hunny dont stress! Hairdressers always cut hair shorter to allow for growth, pin it back for a maximum of 5 days and it should be at the length you asked for x<br>  P.S the actual length looks gorgeous|`|MQ5Sq6wfaa	I think your bangs just need to be spread out more.  Try some pomade.  Wet your hands (just wet, not dripping) and get just a very very small amount of pomade on your hands and run your hands through your hair, but mostly on your bangs.  It should give them that "separated" look like in the picture you wanted.<br>  <br>  It might look better after you wash it too, new haircuts have to be broken in just like new shoes.|`|zbqL749iaa	I don't think it looks that bad, actually.<br>  It almost matches the picture, except the bangs look different.<br>  Your bangs will grow out in a little while, so don't even trippp. <br>  You look very pretty (:|`|11TYEOI1aa	hahahhhhaaaha wow she rly ****** up

dc5579dda31633fb3c2d8612ff7583cdaa	Honestly, I do not like the red highlights at all. Something more natural would have been prettier. The cut is pretty cute.

f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa	I add my regular hair product, fluff and go. Sometimes I will dampen it before I leave and this will reactivate my product.

I am a female tattoo artist, and tattoos on women can be very beautiful when they are done professionally.  If you mark yourself up now, you could scar yourself or worse, give yourself an infection.  Please wait, and get it done the right way, you will be happy you did.  Don't be in such a hurry to impress people or be the cool kid with a tattoo.  Get something nice when you are older, and you will respect yourself for doing it.|`|LBHJaqXoaa	Sarah, you are worth waiting and going to a real tattoo artist for a really nice piece of work.

If you are going to do it at home you have to use India Ink. But be forewarned - it will look like total crap because its an at home tattoo.

jDFVWRLDaa	I'm sure this isn't the answer you want, but the only way to eliminate split ends is to cut them off.  Hair products claim to fix split ends, but they don't actually.  Bummer, right?  The faster you eliminate the split ends, the less they'll spread.  I'd recommend doing it asap.|`|bwLv2USTaa	get a good 2-inch trim if the ends are absolutely horrible.<br>  <br>  if you dye your hair, remember to always use conditioner after shampooing.<br>  if you straighten, make sure to use a protective cream that will keep your hair from getting any heat damage. ('Super Skinny Serum' from Paul Mitchell works great.)<br>  <br>  good luck :]|`|b6e3ec0b5c8a0f30a22e16bc4bbf50fbaa	REALLY REALLY WORKING SOLUTION:<br>  <br>  Split ends is a hair health problem that has it's solution from the roots. So, leave all products that promise with superficial applications. You may get some results with these but it will be momentary.

It's the best for your split ends.|`|IPRs8TgDaa	Split ends will happen to almost anyone who goes too long between trims.<br>  This problem is more common to long hair lovers because they are the most likely to put off getting haircuts. As the hair grows and reaches a certain length, the protective layer of the hair, the cuticle, becomes damaged and allows the fibers of the inner layers, the cortex and medula, to fray. Though most often at the ends, splits can occur anywhere along the hair shaft and when it does happen, breakage occurs producing the feathery appearance in the hair that we refer to as split ends.<br>  <br>  These little frizzies cannot be repaired.<br>  The only remedy is the trimming of the hair on a regular basis. Ignoring the condition will only make the situation worse. The splits will continue up the hair shaft causing more damaged hair that will need to be cut off.<br>  The careful trimming of one-quarter inch every six to eight weeks will keep the hair healthy while still allowing for longer growth. The best person for these trims is your hairdresser, however if you don’t know one you can trust it is possible for a trusted friend or husband to do occasional trims.|`|4xVNVRKGaa	hi girl<br>  i have no more split ends (thank god)<br>  this is my routine:<br>  <br>  -pantene ONLY<br>  -shampoo ONLY roots/ get hair almost dry before letting conditioner <br>   SOAK in ur hair (esp. ends) for like 10 mins in the shower<br>  -get ends trimmed if u haven't yet<br>  -pls try not to straighten ur hair more than 2/week. its soo bad. and if u <br>   must....dont clamp it all the way down to the ends.<br>  -only shampoo couple times a week and let ur hair dry as naturally as<br>   possible.<br>  -always use a hair syrum after u finish styling (i love paul mitchells <br>   super skiny serum)<br>  -try to never brush ir hair lol its bad. only good once in a while to <br>   spread out the oils in ur hair, but mostly causes damage.<br>  -hmmmm anything else? nope<br>  <br>  just trims and less heating appliances.......lemme kno how this goes!!!!!!<br>  <br>  :)|`|HHnQyjFBaa	There is no way to repair split ends.

Rinse out the conditioner and let your hair dry naturally it should feel a bit softer and manageable.<br>  3.Put a red rinse on the colour (rinses wont damage your hair much) if you dont apply a red rinse, your hair will go a kahki brown<br>  4. Find a medium brown not light because it may not take to the hair.  <br>  Goodluck!!

052a52a7d0c9fd6c65ef8da0ce8621f4aa	Just a few days. You will have scabs for 3-5 days. Do not peel them off or you will leave scars. This is common with glycolic acid peels. You should consider a microderm abrasion type system instead. I have been searching for a home one I read about that is supposed to be awesome. It is called 6 Minute Miracle, but I can not find it anywhere. Anyway, microderm doesn't leave scabs like glycolic and you get similar results... especially after a couple of treatments.|`|0d4X54rMaa	yes you should be clear by then if not before<br>  <br>  try using a mixture of baking soda and water<br>  this will neutralize the glycolic peel|`|x8KdepAKaa	Bout' a day or so.

I pierced my own nose a looooong time ago and it worked fine, except it took a long time to pierce cuz the cartilege is so thick, and the numbness from the ice wore off, lol.

Also, theres clear studs out to that arent noticable at all...I did the ring thing too, I bought a pair of rings actually, they were really super skinny gold hoops and i cut one with a wire cutter so it was only a half, and when i put it in, i pushed it thru just enough so u couldnt see it from the outside... that was also for wearing it at work... just some ideas...|`|MGp3asPTaa	get a stud ring until your allowed to get a real one.<br>  personally i'd get a stud. i mean it looks real and it doesn't hurt :]

You could even ask his parents what reminds them of him. After you figured out what's really special to him then you could google image it and try to find a cool picture of it. Maybe you could think of words that remind you of him... or even figure out different symbols that mean different things. Like if he was really loyal then you could choose a symbol for loyalty. If he was brave then a symbol for brave. If you think there's an afterlife then maybe you'd want something heavenly in memory of him. <br>  Personally, I want a memorial tattoo that can be added onto so when other people die they can get their names on it too. <br>  If you don't just simply want his name you could put a banner across whatever tattoo you get with his name or date of birth-date of death.|`|yUpHZwTMaa	make it something that he liked, something that meant alot to him, and to you... instead of having his name, maybe initials... <br>  not sure... try sitting down and writing things down that make you remember him, or something like that... <br>  <br>  <br>  Im very sorry for your loss.|`|jyds7SxGaa	get something that resembles him/his personality. something that you can look at and it will make you think of him.... no crosses or names, think of something that goes deeper and gives more meaning, good luck!|`|82V8XxbRaa	Have a look at the following link with tattoos about different aspects of life....

l46COY9eaa	Oooh girl I have an old fashioned, tried and true, and CHEAP way to try before going out to buy any hair remover stuff! You get a new razor, then whatever foam you like (I've always just used Barbasol), and have a magazine or a radio nearby.  What you do, is after a nice long hot shower (the hot water will soften the leg hair) is sit on the side of the tub and cover your legs with the shaving cream/foam. Then either read a short story in the magazine or listen to 2 songs on the radio. The foam will dry out a little as you read or listen. Then, proceed with shaving (you will need to rinse out the razor more often as the foam has dried a little, it will clog the razor blades faster). Try it! It works!|`|8qeDEWWJaa	Start shaving with baby oil and a better razor! Also. don't shave down there all the time. Shave every time the hair get about as long as a grain of rice.|`|iuQ2DBoyaa	i do not use nair because i gives me WORSE bumps! ! ! ! ! ! you can go to doctor and have them look at it, my bestie did that and it turns out she has a skin type and is lucky it is not on her face. They gave her some skin cream that she puts on everyday and it works great. HER BU MPS ARE GONE! ! !! ! ! I used it a few times and it worked for me too! ! ! Good luck!|`|PtzA4Kx0aa	then just use nair, it really works,hairless,and no bumps since it aint no razor.|`|YgPYv4OPaa	before you shave ,  wet your legs ,  and a really good shaving cream on :]  - i use SatinCare Radiant Apricot. it smells amazing :] & Venus Embrace razor -  also , make sure that your blades arent dull . if you use a disposable razor , theyre horrible , its definately worth the money to just get the actual razor and keep buying blades .  after shaving , rinse your legs off & pat them dry , then use a really good moisturizer :]|`|jA1bdyyHaa	Have you ever tried using mans shaver, it is much easier and you get less cuts, also get some PFB Vanish on-line or in the store, they have them at the nail salon or where they do wax, it is really works, trust me, I used to have the same problems, and now i use it all the time, after I shave, and every day, it is very easy and it is roll on applicator, so you don't have to worry about your hands getting dry when you use it.  Thank you|`|NixLMYGDaa	I know what you mean!!!! I have that same problem (im 13 too). I saw this product on a commercial. You buy it over the phone and its rubber with a rough side u put on it and u rub it on ur skin and the hair is supposed to go away. I'm thinking about buying it. Here is the number: 1-800-605-5281. It's 14.99 plus shipping and handeling. Also I've tried Nair and it ran out WAYYYYYYYYYY too fast.|`|gNvuBITqaa	try waxing instead of shaving.  But if that's not an option make sure your skin is moist and that you're using shaving cream and shave in the direction of hair growth...not against it.  I'm a cosmetologist and I also hold an esteticians license and that's what I suggest to my clients that don't want to wax.  Seems to work.|`|Oen3urF7aa	Im 13 too, and just shave down. If you shave up, your going "against the grain", and down fixes it!
PQzrsXsKaa	My guess would be to get a liquid  foundation (makeup) a few shades lighter than your skin, and just use the brush to make a thin line, or however you want the scar to look, and let it dry.    I've never tried it though, so I don't know how well it would work. I don't even wear makeup...|`|tvKOva8Kaa	huh?... I don't get why you would want that...|`|UbQyyWtuaa	try coverup and oats with an invisible bandaid?|`|NixLMYGDaa	First of all : Why would you want a real looking scar?   Second: I'm not sure.

TCpTlCTRaa	A tight pony tail worn consistently over time can cause traction alopecia. You can try essential oil scalp treatments to stimulate the follicles.

Also, he actually knows what it reads, unlike 95% of the people that get tattoos in foreign languages.<br>  <br>  If you really want a tattoo, go for it.

If so, then I think the respectful thing to do would be to hold off on the tattoo until you're independent from them.  If not, then it's really up to you.<br>  <br>  As far as whether or not the tattoo is a good idea.  I think if you can read Chinese characters, then sure, get them.  If you can't, then I'd stick to something you can understand such as a proverb that speaks to you.|`|LBHJaqXoaa	I think a chinese proverb would make an awesome tattoo. Any of the places you are thinking of would be good places to get them. I would personally get it on my shoulder, but that is just me. <br>  <br>  And don't tell your parents. Let them see it and process it on their own. You are 18 now, like you said, so you won't get in trouble when they see it. Odds are they won't say anything about it when they do see it anyways. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|psLk5fDGaa	If your asking whether or not you should get a tattoo, then you probably shouldn't. When the time is right it will come to you. There's always a nervous anxiety in the pit of your stomach about getting your first tattoo, but that isn't the same as questioning it. <br>  You don't need your parent's permission. Once it's done, it's done and there isn't much they can do about it. They'll understand. <br>  But for now, wait a few more months and think about it.|`|L0u3uEJLaa	if you really want a tattoo then get one it doesn't matter what your parents say just what you think.just remember that you cant get rid of it if you dont like it.|`|zYxsPST6aa	if you want it then yes, get it.  NEVER base your tattoo design on how much it will hurt or how much it will cost, get it because you like it.  as for your parents, you can tell them that this is your way of showing your grown up now.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|zQLNAwaWaa	tattoos are painful in areas where you can feel your bone because its a needle poking your skin a lot of times in a second! So it will jab your bone and it will hurt, so it will be painful in some areas more than others.<br>  <br>  Try to get an image of the tattoo you want to get and what i recommend is to take a least three months to look at the picture and see if you still like it. Remember tattoos are their forever but even you do remove it with laser treatment or whatever, it will leave scars.<br>  <br>  Tattoos are a way to express yourself and sometimes you'll find yourself having to hide it for job interviews.<br>  So make sure your tattoo can easily be hidden.<br>  <br>  If you really do care about your parents opinion, then consult them first. Remember you don't need their permission so you can still get a tattoo even though their not okay with it.<br>  <br>  So regardless of what the design of the tattoo is, make sure your gonna like it for the rest of your life!

0X7DWnyeaa	Having the shoes on for a short period of time is good for a foot tattoo. You will want to wash and apply ointment to your new tattoo immediately after practice. <br>  <br>  Yes, tattoos do "bleed" or "weep" ink after getting it. Sometimes your tattoo can continue to weep for up to a week. This is completely normal.<br>  <br>  Also, using certain types of ointment can cause the tattoo to weep more. I've found that regular lotions, A&D ointment, etc. cause more weeping. You want something that has vitamins to soothe and heal your skin. Tattoo Goo is a great product. But if you aren't willing to cough up the extra cash and possibly having to order it online, Aquaphor is a great product. My artist recommends it and I have used it on my tattoos. If you are allergic to anything petroleum based there are all natural healing balms out there.|`|vT9oyqzxaa	I got a foot tattoo, full foot.

loqsl5xXaa	u need to go to the salon and have them treat your hair to repair the damage. then buy some for your home (either at the store or the salon) and wash your hair make sure you condition and i'm sure it will be ok. but get to the salon. and dont bleach again, lol sweetie good luck|`|8THz1sp9aa	you definitely fried your hair. you really need to find a good deep conditioner and keep it in your hair for like 20/30 minutes every night. as long as your hair doesn't feel gummy and breaks every time you just slightly touch it, you should be fine. Just keep conditioning and wait it out.|`|FV0BoSkTaa	make sure your getting the right nutrition too.  That was happening to me a while ago too, and I thought it was because I was bleaching and dying my hair so much, but it was actually because I wasn't getting enough vitamins and stuff.<br>  Try taking a multi-vitamin and deep condition your hair.  That should help.|`|FrCqIAPQaa	Oh that's bad. Um...don't pull out any more and make yourself an emergency appointment at an actual salon, not a hair dresser. Bleaching is risky business, I'd recommend professionals handle it next time...the bleach basically destroys your hair like bleach destroys...stains...and everything else. Good luck!|`|1O9jE4P2aa	not normal. unfortunately, you fried your hair and you NEED to get to a hair salon asap. quit pulling at your hair and dont put it up in any kind of pony tail or anything. dont wash it.|`|J0UU1Bvraa	you can brush your hair when its soaking wet but when your dryng it dont brush it until it is completely dry or it will cause breakage

xN2JUcmvaa	Shorter hair might make you look taller than way longer hair, but only if there's a huge difference. It's kind of an illusion sometimes. :P So some people say. And no, it's not like 2-3 inches taller. Thats insane! Or a lot of people would have shorter hair. Haha [; <br>  <br>  And you should be happy with 5' 5". I'm like 5' 1".<br>  <3 I envy you.|`|GG2bxCd1aa	Well small and neat look may help you look taller depending on your body built.

There's no mess whatsoever with them.<br>  <br>  You do need to follow any makeup remover with moisturizer though; that's probably why you're having to deal with dry skin.

Holy effing GOD they're annoying. Shy, nice guys are a breath of fresh air.|`|1XxVxFikaa	its cute when boys blush,i dont like boys who think there all that and smooth,i boys a little bit shy,and if you blush in front of a girl,thats just letting her know you like her,its totally norm!and hot!|`|k1AZtmM1aa	Don't worry about that,you'll find a girl who likes you for that|`|R1uFA7nKaa	no i think its cute!|`|OoftsMLhaa	A confused state of mind acts upon the sympathetic nervous system.  From there, the vasodilators are stimulated which causes the peripheral capillaries to expand. As a result, more blood flows to the surface of the face and neck, resulting in the reddening of the face and neck.<br>  <br>  The only way to prevent this is to be completely relaxed and comfortable in every situation which is basically impossible as you get older and more experienced in life your confidence will overwhelm whatever insecurities you may have now.  Until then use it they will think its cute.|`|Ge6WhCf7aa	some girls may find it cute like aww hes blushing.<br>  <br>  so its maybe something you dont want to get rid of but if you get all excited and your mouth closes up and you dont know what to say.<br>  <br>  just try to keep calm and maintain a positive attitude.|`|uAiKpNumaa	its not weird it cute! lol my bf used to blush around me now he only blushes if he does something bad. i think blushing is just a way for a guy to show hey i do like u and im shy but im going for it so feel good about ur self|`|qMfBq3Vlaa	no it is not weird for your age thses things happen... as you grow older and matured, you will know what to do and say.|`|c6zymHmTaa	I like chicks too.

ItOBf6Ojaa	You can go get a straightening perm, which should last about 6months-1 year if they're good. <br>  <br>  You shouldn't try to make it permanent.

Your natural hair will grow about a inch per month ( so they say ) so how ever your natural hair is kinky, curly or nappy it's pretty much permanent just buy a straightener|`|2QgGUhAAaa	Go to a Black Beauty Salon and the sistahs or brotha will hook your hair up right.

I hate baggy jeans|`|C33jsdydaa	They arent going anywhere.<br>  And you obviously dont know what youre talking about, I wear skinny jeans and im a guy, and im not gay<br>  <br>  Alot of other guys at my school do too.<br>  IT has nothing to do with being gay or straight<br>  <br>  thats like me saying,regular jeans look weird on girls. You never know if they are lesbians or not...<br>  <br>  But skinny jeans on REAL BIG kids = nasty<br>  <br>  and i look damn good in my skinny jeans too,js|`|46mCzLkAaa	NO, they are awesome and stylish.. and very very hot on guys|`|TbM4K6Ytaa	no way!!! i live in them. theyre really comfortable. lol theyre way less annoying than flares or bootcuts coz when you walk with them they always make that noise when the legs brush past each other. however, some guys look really weird in them(especially skaters). unless theyre kinda baggy skinny. sorta. but they still look weird.|`|SghwXlQ9aa	Yeah, me too! I just like the classic boot cut look. Skinny jeans don't really fit me well, because I am a little on the heavy side and have a large butt. I just stick to my classics and don't fall into the trend.|`|IStGqIWBaa	Yeah i know at my school all the girls dress exactly the same. You know with the skinny jeans and those weird sunglasses. Haha!

It's really how they are worn.  They can be very chic, or they can just be tacky.  It depends on the outfit|`|BcWs38MWaa	um not realy payed much attention to who wears em but i do not like seein skinny jeans on fat as     s girls lol|`|Q68wyCuMaa	Have you ever thought that maybe they're wearing them cause they like them? <br>  I don't know, just a thought.|`|wqCiDIB5aa	Yes.|`|JSuMBerCaa	no!!!!!!!!!! they are great!|`|YKMBnIrFaa	I understand what you mean. While I like the tapered look (to me, it gives an outfit a sharp edge and a clean-cut look that I find appealing) I do also have my favorite pair that flares a little at the bottom and the denim is so soft now it's like I'm not wearing jeans. Then again, I also have the body type for skinny jeans and can get away with it (big hips + skinny jeans = bad joojoo!) :D|`|Rin6yStOaa	OMG!!!! i feel the same way. its like, wat r they trying to show. they have nothing (in the butt area). now i think that tight around the thigh and loose from the knee down!!!!!! i hate it when girls just walk around with skinny jeans. they r waayyyyy to expencive!!! that is soo cool that there is someone else who feels the same way!!! lol!!|`|8MNpes83aa	omg soo annoying! i hate them! and thats prettty much all the stores sell i hatte them they r uncomfortable and really dumb looking. bell bottoms will never go out. and they make ur butt look better. i absolutely HATE when guys wear them tho thats just not right. if ur bf wears ur jeans, theres something wrong.|`|gMDJ75Gsaa	I personally hate them . I like my baggy jeans . In my town you can buy alot of Boyfriend fit jeans , and just boot cut jeans . Only a couple stores have some skinny jeans . Its funny though seeing people who shouldn't wear them , wear them .|`|5yIph0u5aa	I think they are ugly and that is all that is in stores right now. It is creepy when guys where them, and some girls should be banned from wearing them.
az9IYqleaa	Ur make up looks fine :) Maybe you could put on some eyeshadow? like maybe a pink or purple? it'll make ur eyes stand out more with the eyeliner :)<br>  <br>  LOL! Red. Stains. Everything! Red make up stains the skin! silly billy! Once I put red eye shadow on, on haloween and i couldn't get it all fully off! Hmm... Yeah vaseline and soap will get it off if u scrub hard enough. And use hot water. If it still doesn't come off get ur toothbrush and rub it off. It will probably work... But I wouldn't know. I don't use red lipstick.<br>  <br>  You look fine :)<br>  Yes the eyeliner looks good <br>  hope I helped! :D|`|cNZAO5BRaa	The eyeliner is a good color for you.<br>  <br>  You can take lipstick off the skin fairly easily with a tissue soaked in baby oil. Or, use a cloth you don't mind staining red and cover your cheek with Vaseline and use the cloth (DRY!!) to rub off the lipstick.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|wRsSodTAaa	Vaseline will take make-up off.  And the eyeliner is fine.  You did a good job on it.  Plus, the blue color of your eyes is beautiful. :-)|`|RQx3PTZvaa	make up romoval wipes.<br>  <br>  <br>  you're eyes are pretty.|`|s8Wv50viaa	do you have olive oil in your house?<br>  that's the best natural makeup remover.<br>  I'm not joking here.<br>  It's also good for your skin too <br>  :]|`|A8F4HF3Paa	Finger nail polish remover works, but then you need to wash your cheek right away with a facial cleanser.|`|46mCzLkAaa	it doesnt look good on ya babes,
xqrwDmyUaa	It depends on your hair, I have frizzy hair those 2 products it didn't work for me, what did work was Bedhead Afterparty. Go into any salon and ask them about it and they will tell you how good it is. It's an amazing product, I use a drop of S factor smoother and lusterizer to straighten my hair with and then I smooth out the frizzies with Afterparty, works every time. I used to have HUGE poofy frizzy hair.|`|Zi0g5K3Iaa	You can straighten it.|`|2QgGUhAAaa	No, Bed Head is geared more toward a straighter type of hair, to me it adds texture, weird but true.<br>  Now this product line called Phyto, they have the good stuff for your hair type: <br>  <a href="http://www.phyto-usa.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.phyto-usa.com/</a><br>  Their products are known to work very good. Costly but so worth it. Check out the products link and to the left the Anti-Frizz products. I know they sell them at Pure Beauty.|`|I9Mudcqyaa	Personally i dont like Bed Head products but its up to you..i dont find they work as well as others..<br>  alot of the joico products are good for taming frizzies but..:)
YKMBnIrFaa	Tapered jeans are really good ways to slim down your legs. Also, wearing something with a heel (no clunky shoes!) helps to elongate your legs. If you're careful, you could even use a high cut boot to go over normal pants and slim your calves down.|`|c6zymHmTaa	nothing|`|JFA9DpFCaa	black or dark grey leggings work really well.  Stay away from skinny jeans, but go for a straight leg and darker wash.|`|NDomrg7daa	black legging|`|ox7mJ2Psaa	a back pack full of rocks so you build up the muscles in your legs and they get smaller instead of just look smaller. if you chose between looking a certain way or having those qualities, do the work and become thinner, stronger or smarter.|`|tITPAbeKaa	definitely wear darker trousers/pants. Darker the colour, the more slimming it is.<br>  <br>  Also, if you're getting something like jeans, you could get the distressed one with distressing in the front/back. This means the sides are a bit darker so it makes your legs looks thinner.<br>  see: <a href="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41Q6JD1CF6L._AA280_.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/41...</a><br>  <br>  But you have bigger thighs, don't go for jeans that are faded at the top but darker below the knees-they emphasize your thighs.<br>  <br>  You could wear slim fitting jeans rather than baggy ones-get heavy fabric pants that will act like a corset on your legs.<br>  Also you can always wear longer tees or even dresses over pants/jeans to cover up the big legs.

HiuZs5G5aa	personality would be the exact same as this one person i know who lives a long way away from me.|`|zQiYKgMLaa	I like smart girls who are super sweet, but can take a joke and have a smart-alec quality to them.  I like funny girls who keep me laughing and make me joke around with them, but also smart girls that like to have good conversations about things like politics, morality, etc.  I guess I get bored easy, so I like to go from 1 extreme to the other.  <br>  <br>  I also like girls that like to get dressed up and are comfortable in a more traditional female/wife role.  I want a girl that's interested in a marriage minded relationship with the right guy, not looking for any husband that comes along.  I like a girl that will sit down and watch a football game with me, and wants to go hiking/camping with me.  A girl that's into cars is right on par IMO.  Then again I like girls that like to do their hair and makeup and can be girly-girl sometimes too.  A girl who is a little more into Art than I am and have some different interests than myself is good too. I'm kinda quiet usually, so I can deal with someone who is talkative. I'd say most important is a girl that's a Christian and is headed in the same direction I am in life.<br>  <br>  Physically, I like tall slender/athletic girls (5'7-6').  Most important to me is a cute face with bright eyes and personally I prefer unique/bigger noses.  Give me a nice soft smile.  Smaller boobs and butt is my preference.  Hair color isn't important, but I do have a slight preference for blonde hair.  I definitely like straight hair more than curly.<br>  <br>  I can't explain chemistry though, but it's needed.  There needs to be a spark there and I don't know what causes it.  It's hard, but I have to have a connection with someone and be able to open up deep from inside and relax with that person.  I suppose someone who can fill the quiet moment with some fun and laughter, someone who can just sit and enjoy the silence with me, someone who gets me, and a girl that just likes to snuggle up and cuddle.  I'm a physical touch kinda guy, it's how I express and receive "loved" best.<br>  <br>  I kinda feel like i just threw up mentally.  I hope that all makes sense.|`|whFZ639Daa	I think looks for most men<br>  but if there are sweethearts which every girl wants and your personality would make those sweethearts love you :D<br>  <br>  may you please answer my question thank you<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ApCJqBY9CKR8LGa1_4EAz07sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220220430AALWw3k">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|JSuMBerCaa	butt, eyes, height, funny.|`|1XxVxFikaa	the question every girl wants to know.|`|SWHFvXI0aa	If they laugh at my jokes i would date em lol|`|JtbsRWEiaa	There is no exact answer to this question, because it is different for every guy out there. Some guys are looking for a toy to show off, and others are looking for their mothers.<br>  As for physical characteristics, once again, it is different from guy to guy. Many are breasts men, others are butt and leg men. Myself personally I'm a whole body man. It depends on what direction that she is standing when I first see her.<br>  Personality is the same song with a different verse. I always went for those who weren't crazy, although that sometimes didn't show up until later, who didn't try to change me, and those that have the same ideals and values that I have and try to live by.<br>  I'm sorry because I know that this doesn't really answer your question, but it is reality. For just as with  women; every man is different. With different likes and interest. <br>  The best advise that I can give to you is to just be yourself, work with what you have, and if a fellow does not like you for you; then he's a worthless piece of  bat quano anyway. Good luck in your search.|`|Y96jpGe2aa	A person who loves and believes in herself.  A person who may not be that pretty but knows how to dress herself up and take care of her body.

But seriously, the ColorStay is amazing and you can build the coverage...But one problem is that it is hard to get off your skin without a special makeup remover...<br>  You can also try Neutrogena's Healthy Skin Foundation but the coverage is not that great...|`|46mCzLkAaa	MAC costs over 40 dollars for a bottle of tops foundation<br>  <br>  tinted moisturiser is fantastic, i use it every day, it doesnt clog pores, it evens skin tone, cheap, makes your skin glow.. just before you use it wash your face with oil controlling face wash or scrub if your skin is oily.|`|ePfPOeAzaa	i knw this not so expensive one...GOSH cover me up mousse...it transforms to powder on the face,is light and has a smooth finish.but before applying any foundation it's wise to use a light concealer pen to cover up the blemishes/scars.and after the foundation use GOSH compact powder on the face.it really works!|`|5pSTEiWQaa	same with me.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://img526.imageshack.us/img526/3466/neutrogenahr2.th.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img526.imageshack.us/img526/3466/...</a><br>  I put this on first<br>  <br>  ( its neutrogena foundation )<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://pics.drugstore.com/prodimg/18833/200.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://pics.drugstore.com/prodimg/18833/...</a><br>  then this<br>  <br>  (covergirl )<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.short-hair-style.com/images/physicians-formula-mineral-wear-talc-free-mineral-loose-powder-8297.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.short-hair-style.com/images/p...</a><br>  then this<br>  <br>  ( mineral powder) <br>  <br>  <br>  the first link, and the third link are really good for your face (:<br>  <br>  <br>  this make up really works for me.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  can buy them at walmart, cvs, rite aid.<br>  <br>  not expensive*!|`|RcBkUBsfaa	mac is the best if your looking or a powder try the mac studio fix..ita about $28...<br>  <br>  if you want a liquid foundation that looks natural try revlon colorstay foundation!!<br>  when you use both combined it looks great|`|dbI7JFCDaa	ok well look i think that for a very natural look and something that covers very good you should go for bareminerals. I have been using this for about 3 years and it is so good!!!! For $40 it comes with a blush brush,a kabuki brush and a concealer brush. It also comes with a foundation, a mineral vail and a face color like bronzer. oh and a primer alll for $40|`|1xsUVtzBaa	I use Estee Lauder Maximum cover...its $57 in australia..but it will literally last you a year. A pea size amount is all thats needed and it blends seamlessly and can be used as a concealer too. It's light and it doesn't go dry on you...its also waterproof and sweat proof. It's made for anyone with scars..surgical or acne or even to cover birthmarks or portwine stains.<br>  You can go to a estee lauder counter and ask for them to make up a sample to take home and try...if you love it go back and buy it. I love it and have been using it for around 7 years. I know ur pain and this is the only foundation i will use ever!|`|fYDdhsI2aa	MAC Studio Fix Foundation is completely amazing!<br>  It's so worth buying, it's just simply amazing.<br>  I have so many acne scars from pimples, and I have<br>  a lot of discoloration, and the MAC studio fix covers<br>  it up completely. I love it!<br>  But it sadly does cost $35 for it. <br>  Well, depending on where you live..|`|V4sl71Oaaa	I use TrueBlend  I think thats what its called lol.<br>  And it works REALLY good and looks natural.<br>  And its sorta cheap.<br>  sorry I forgot how much it was around 20 dollars i think?
b640775ccf3ad91701f500707df78aefaa	Use a good moisturzing conditioner...Rinsing your hair in cold water helps tame the pouf. Apply a good anti-frizz ...Apply  oil at least once a month...Blow-drying hair before adding any product to the hair will cause it to poof more....use a really good flat iron like the chic i use work good..........My friend have very curly hair a she use the kstyler and she love it leave her hair soft and nice lol...|`|MJyM1XWJaa	use pomme or other similar products from the drugstore or salon if you have the money. it'll manage the frizz.|`|3OeE8kMQaa	Try a ceramic flat iron, use product (like hair spray or anti-frizz spray after). I have frizzy curly hair and it works for me.|`|2QgGUhAAaa	You need some CHI silk infusion drops, this will insure that your hair will stay silky while flat ironing it. If you're pressing your hair you will need some Soft n Sheen pressing creme, now that will keep it nice and straight but stiff. Sounds like you're not blowdrying it straight on high heat. So, make sure you always with a comb attachment use an ION blowdryer on high heat after you've washed and deep condition your hair good with a conditioner like Joico K-Pak (smells like bananas). Put a plastic cap on and let it sit for an hour while you're around the house. Rinse, apply the CHI silk infusion drops, comb out with a big comb, now blowdry your hair downward motion to lay flat. Next, get some CHI flatirons or Ceramic coated (cheaper) flatirons and do it in small sections. Now you will have silky, straight with no frizz at all.<br>  hth<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|JlyYRBCIaa	get a CHI iron. get heat protectant for your hair, and flatten it out. but if you have really frizzy hair like mine, you have to be conscious of the weather. When i know its going to be humid I use John Freida's Weather Works shampoo and conditioner. it helps my hair stay under control. but if you know its going to be raining, you should really scrunch your hair and wear it curly. you just have to think ahead.|`|E3SJNlIUaa	You should use the sleek and smooth creme by garnier frutis. I use that after i straighten my hair, and i have extremely curly hair! also try not to straighten it often, because that will ruin your hair, especially because you have curly hair.|`|EUGoxWXuaa	use straight hair product and de-frizz product<br>  both will smoothen your hair<br>  be careful with straighteners as with out the right products, they are bad for your hair!|`|1vKY3Usaaa	buy a new straightner.<br>  or buy some heat resistant spray and spray it in your hair before you straighten it.
wZYJwXCnaa	i love it! my boyfriend actually gave me a bouquet of stargazers and red roses for v day. i've been wanting to get lilies added to the tattoo i have on my foot.|`|L5jjhYnNaa	Honestly I don't like it.<br>  but...<br>  I think this is gorgeous...<br>  <a href="http://media.photobucket.com/image/flower%20tattoo/Eurekas_World/Tattoo/Side/Tulip.jpg?o=56" rel="nofollow">http://media.photobucket.com/image/flowe...</a>|`|EALy7X7Gaa	thts pretty!! :D|`|a31kUn1Naa	I agree with the one girl. I'm not feeling it either. I mean the colors are fabulous. But I don't know....|`|ibOD8ggDaa	pretty|`|NhOQ3mRxaa	I love it it doesn't look bad at all!!! Well ok!<br>  Chelsei@|`|Cavz3kAPaa	Ok, it's really really hard to tell if the tattoo is done well. <br>  To be honest, from this picture the tattoo looks like the line work is a bit wonky, and it's a bit fussy for me. Would be better if it was just the stargazer flower, and not the daisies (?) as well.<br>  <br>  It also doesn't look realistic to me.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER:<br>  I love flower tattoos, I have a Dutch Iris on my thigh. I'd love to see a better/crisper photo because like I said it's hard to tell the quality.<br>  And my opinion on things is if you like it, then you should be happy, who cares what a bunch of people on the internet think. My brother thinks both of my tattoos are awful, and I think the same of his (his is of a Smashing Pumpkins logo of all things!) I just shrug and think "well he isn't going to see mine everyday, I am, and I love it!".<br>  <br>  So if you love your tattoo then Go You! Wear it with Pride.|`|0X7DWnyeaa	besides the quality of the picture it looks good. The colors do look a bit dull. With a new tattoo the colors should be very bright and vibrant. Is it that maybe the tattoo is dry? Or it could just be the quality of the picture.|`|loqsl5xXaa	im not really a flower person for tattoos, but it doesn't look bad. As long as you are happy with it, who cares what others think.|`|BcWs38MWaa	um not my type of tattoo but im sure it looks better in person or at least when it heels up its aight tho|`|UVThm042aa	ewwwwww that has to be the most disgusting thing i have ver seen! i just threw up in my mouth|`|wfbf44rUaa	sorry i'm not feeling it!!!
JM6veEXwaa	yourjellybaby is right on with the classic one.<br>  <br>  If you have money there's also laser treatments.<br>  <br>  Stretch marks are caused by the lower layer of your skin breaking.<br>  Eating more copper (like in dark chocolate) will help prevent it getting worse.  Also if you have weight to lose, getting thinner will make your skin less stretched out so the stretch marks will look smaller.|`|4nQVsEHnaa	you can get rid of some of them with a tummy tuck not sure of any other way, but there are creams that can help minimize the look|`|hmMb2oMOaa	cocoa butter|`|YsTk4a1xaa	Its cocoa butter....|`|sl77hgDTaa	garnier light
pus08YEOaa	Can you wear your own shoes and socks/tights? Change up your hairstyle, decorate your backpack, wear eye makeup like Siouxsie Sioux, etc.|`|tgCNwQ2Saa	badges might help... you could also stitch some iconic patches to it...|`|UQhn8hfmaa	Put your uniform inside out like fresh prince of bel air! lol jk jk.
zKAzJKnqaa	I was a customer of Coastal Scents.  I have two of their palettes, and several gel liners and brushes.  I loved all of the products I purchased.  However, I will no longer be ordering from Coastal Scents.  I heard on YouTube that you can get the same stuff for cheaper off of ebay.  I did some research and found the exact same palettes, liners, brushes, (pretty much everything), on ebay for at least half the price.  I mean these are the EXACT same products.  So I would recommend saving yourself some money and buying from ebay.|`|WYKxh9mFaa	Coastal Scents is an awesome company for either people who are just starting in makeup or aren't willing to spend a whole bunch of money on makeup. I have two of their eyeshadow palettes, a handful of brushes, and a couple gel liners. Although the eyeshadows in the 88 palette aren't very large, you do get a large variety of colors, but the pans in the 28 neutral palette are more normal sized. Although the brushes aren't as high quality as say, MAC, there are couple that I really like. A couple of their larger brushes shed a lot, but you can't complain considering what you're paying. The gel liners are really nice and pigmented and can even be used as a base for your eyeshadows. Overall, I personally like Coastal Scents, but if you're looking for high quality makeup products and don't mind spending some money, I'd recommend something more like MAC or Ben Nye.|`|ND4wPcQkaa	I love coastal scents. I have 2 of their palettes right now and can't wait to get more! I haven't tried the blush one but i've heard great things about it. Their eyeshadow is very pigmented and lasts all day long. It's soooo worth it for the price. The only thing i don't like about coastal scents is how much the shipping and handling comes out to....but i'm willing to overlook it since i love their products.|`|b640775ccf3ad91701f500707df78aefaa	i love it the eye shadow are very  pigmented
