NQU7VoR2aa	Same reason why guys have breast, legs and booty fetishes. Its a simple matter of sexual taste, thats it. You might as well ask why do guys have the fetishes mentioned above, youll pretty much get the same answer. Im sure most of us (if not all) has a particular part of a person that drives you wild more than other places.<br>  <br>  Remember that the word "fetish" implies that the person cannot act sexually or get aroused unless the particular fixation is present. However, if they simply like it as well as everything then its not a fetish, its  a fondness or interest and it just makes them a foot man, just like breast and but men.<br>  <br>  All of this aside though, remember this, its important that a guy appreciate YOU in every way, not just a part of you, no matter what it is, otherwise that just aint right and you should just forget them in favor of someone who appreciates the whole of you.|`|dckhOavsaa	An actual foot FETISH would creep me out and make me turn away. Then again, any kind of real fetish would do that, because when something is an actual fetish, rather than just a heightened appreciation, it kind of crosses a line of depravity.<br>  I guess what you would need to do is figure out for yourself if this is a sincere appreciation for your specific feet, or a bizarre, sex-crazed lust for all feet. Go with your feelings and your interpetations.<br>  I love when my boyfriend expresses how much he appreciates my feet- especially because he's one of those people that's like "bleck- I hate feet!" and is repulsed by all but mine. It gives me a very nice "yay, I'm special and I'm the exception because he loves me!" feeling. :)|`|vimfbSxfaa	lol did it turn you on?|`|n2oEhdZiaa	Can't say that it does anything for me.|`|0LqslIMLaa	Its not unheard of, but a little odd. To ask "Why" would be same as asking why do some guys like larger girls versus skinnier, tan skin versus pale, gay versus straight?<br>  <br>  Simply put, if it is that way, then thats how it is, understanding why isn't really important. If your comfortable giving into that kind of thing, or at least trying to, then do so, if not just explain that it feels a little weird to you.|`|bB5d5YVeaa	Technically, there is no such thing as a "foot fetish".  Fetishes are only for objects and not parts of the body.  He can have a shoe fetish or other fetishes, but not an actual foot fetish.|`|QevBVANtaa	uhhhh thats weird.. lol

diGsA3isaa	I used to have this problem also. I found Designer Skin lotions and it does absolute wonderrrrrrs for my arms! I used Black & Spellbound by them, both of them smell so good and work amazing! You can buy them at designerskin.com or try and find some off ebay! It leaves your skin about 20 times darker and really smooth|`|Ym6PCJRYaa	I used to have the same problem and I didnt want to pay extra for their special leg tanner machine that you just stick  your legs in- so I would just use the stool in the room and put my legs in there and not my body. You could try that with just your arms. Maybe just 2 or 3 times... or until they match your body. :)

GeTuH9edaa	I have EXACTLY the same predicament but I'm not brave enough to go blonde. Why don't you just try it and if you don't like blonde, just dye it back to your original colour! :)|`|tgCNwQ2Saa	hmm, I'm thinking ofa hot color right now... TRY DEEP PINK FOR a change..|`|71i6IjdZaa	Why not try blonde darl? If you don't like it, you could always dye it back, to be honest blonde seems like it would suit you:) If your pretty sure blonde wont suit you, why not try something REALLY different, like all black, except for at the front, where you could have blonde, that way you will get an idea if you would want to go full blonde:)<br>  xx<br>  <br>  EDIT: Ive been putting alot of though into this, and maybe you could keep your brown hair, or if you don't want to dye it black, and have any other colour you want underneath it at the back, my friend has this and it looks great! except she has blonde hair, and black underneath. Good luck with what ever you decide hun:)<br>  xx|`|ddXQeEvNaa	Since you have olive skin you can pull off an intense blue-black.

5z32ftzkaa	Yes.  If they don't over process it, you'll be fine.  A perm never comes out.  It grows out and will be there till you cut it.  It may relax a bit but it will always be permed.|`|7e87b9f7a30f59fd601be09dae6f1a30aa	Not life long damage but they damage the hair that is permed permanently but it will grow out and that hair will be healthy. I used to get perms when I was a teenager all of the time. Since I had long hair it took about 2 years for the permed hair to grow out sometimes longer depending on how much I had cut off. Hair grows at a rate of 6 inches a year.|`|lcneir8Raa	it actually depends on the type of perm you get, some perms don't damage your hair at all while others do

rjac15O0aa	Take some hgh and make yourself fit the tattoo!  No dude, no worries.  They can make it fit you arm...|`|Jmi1rZeEaa	you'll have to go to your artist. mostly they can resize it to fit your arm. or they can just modify it a little so it does fit.<br>  it all depends on what the tattoo is|`|dNtndSrkaa	they can size it ti fit so dont worry i do it all the time artist for 8 yrs
XomCHGrtaa	You are beautiful either way. I honestly prefer the picture with no makeup. It looks natural, and you're stunning. <br>  I think you look like Jennifer Alba. You look to have the same type of style, and skin tone. You are both very gorgeous.! <br>  Kristen Stewart's hair would be amazing on you! You guys look very alike. As for makeup, I like how natural hers is. It's not like, Oh My God, she's wearing makeup! It's more like, Oh look, doesn't that eyeshadow accent her eyes? Her makeup isn't trampy, it's classy, and very nice. I recommend the look for you.<br>  And style wise, I don't think Kristen Stewart's look is for you. What I can see you in, judging by your picture is Preppy but stylish clothing, and comfort. So, I think for you, you should look at Garage and Lulu Lemon. :)<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.|`|a33d5de0b01cdd9d983412e63421af9aaa	I actually agree with the other responses that you should go somewhere in the middle.<br>     The eyeliner is nice, but a bit much.  Don't extend the line all the way to the inner corner of the eye.  It makes your eyes look too close together.  Emphasize the outer corner, and also don't line the whole way under the eye: stop where the iris of the eye on the inner side stops as a rule of thumb.  Concealer is great, the lips are awesome~<br>  You kind of remind me of Anne Hathaway!<br>  I think Kisten Stewart's style is fabulous!|`|RoFfCYGxaa	I think you look really pretty and both, but you actually look older in the picture without make-up & I like it the best.  You have really big, pretty eyes.  You do look like a celebrity, but I can't place who.  I definitely think you could pull off Kristen Stewart's hair & make-up, but I honestly don't really know what her clothing style is like so I can't answer that part.|`|KCpGsN2faa	They both look good, you're an adorable girl. The first one is good, something fun to do with eyeline that would look cute on you is taking a little farther out so you have little wings on your eyes. Kristen Stewart's look would be perfect for you! I think you look kind of like Rachel Bilson.|`|cfkuPoMaaa	You look sooooo good without makeup.  Kristen Stewart is the perfect person to try to look like for you.  When she wears less makeup.  If you are wearing eyeliner i know you're wearing alot in that pic, but i wouldn't recommend wearing that much.  But Kristen Stewart is a good idea|`|VBEMxcopaa	You look fine in both, If I had to pick I would say the make up because you look snazzy, I think you look like that girl from Juno|`|pF52xgMPaa	I actually quite like the eyeliner look, maybe just tone it down for everyday. It makes your eyes really stand out.|`|VkmXjmBNaa	its a hard choice but you  look great with the makeup youll have to fight the boys off xD|`|f1AvsgCDaa	u kinda hot|`|7FIe6xBAaa	i'd go in between both.<br>  wear a thickening mascara but no eyeliner to make an everyday look.<br>  <br>  i wouldn't say that you look like a celebrity but her look would suit you, you have the same kind of features as her (i.e. face shape, hair colour skin tone etc.)|`|jWmnSXlLaa	I like the makeup look better. But then again I just love makeup. I do think your still pretty without it and look like you have a  great skin complexion. I don't know the hair your talking about But I love the hair with the dark color underneath.|`|ibtLgY5Xaa	I think you should go in the middle.<br>  Definitely don't wear all the eyeliner you did in the first picture, ah.<br>  But you can put a little on to make your eyes pop.<br>  And yes, I think that hair would suit you well.|`|yXGlmUqlaa	you're very pretty.<br>  you look good both ways but i do like how the eyeliner looks. maybe use less for everyday wear.<br>  <br>  and yes i think think that her style would suit you. actually you have that look where you could pull off any style you want.|`|K7vCWru6aa	No make-up looks wayyyy better! Yeah i love her style and it'd go well on you :] good luck!
WDbE5gffaa	Same colour hair as mine, and its very possible. <br>  People get that colour with dark brown hair sometimes, its just not as easy. <br>  They'll probably do it with just one sitting, with one bleach, and it will probably take a long time, about 2 hours. Gentle bleach though :)|`|OMKDEun3aa	Yes, you can but if they do have them foil out the whole head with bleach you get more even color throughout not just put it on section by section all over ....all over but foil out little sections every section in foil whole head depending on your length if short to medium if long they need to do ends first then go back and put on root.. hope i helped
dNtndSrkaa	yes you can they some times do that to see if you actualy want it or like you say the pain factor most dont hurt that bad some people say it dont hurt there or if it does only a few spots might be bad|`|585ab0776084269babf0060c20972036aa	Well, theoretically you could, but really, tattoos are not all that painful unless you have a really low tolerance.  Some artists may be willing to do it, some may not.  You will likely be charged the minimum price anyway, even without the ink, so IMO you might as well get something for your money.  If you're worried about pain, start off with an area that is less sensitive.  Areas like the shoulder, upper arm, outer thigh, and outer calf tend to be less painful than other areas.  Areas like the feet, back, chest, ankle, front or back of calf or thigh, neck, and inner arm tend to be more painful.|`|lU8e0VQFaa	When I got my first, I was all paid up and in the chair and my artist did a small line without any ink to let me know how it was (he didn't tell me there wasn't any ink til after). It's really not that bad.|`|kCdISEGqaa	No, it's a waste of time.  It would cost you the price of the tattoo you wanted.  Needles, machines, gloves, time, it's not worth it for an artist to do.

585ab0776084269babf0060c20972036aa	A ring is not the best jewelry choice for a hood piercing.  If it's tilting to the side, it could be the weight of the jewelry causing this.  I would recommend going to another piercer and having them switch out your jewelry for a curved or straight barbell.  The problem with rings is that when they lay to one side, they tend to pull, which can cause your piercing to migrate to the side.  If you let this go for long, your piercing may end up totally crooked.  Vertical hood piercings are often uncomfortable when not centered correctly, and they will not add any kind of sensation if not centered.  <br>  <br>  At this point, the swelling is probably gone, hood piercings tend to heal very fast.  It sounds to me like the girl is making excuses for her error.  <br>  <br>  One thing many piercers fail to realize is that you don't always place the piercing directly in the middle.  The hood doesn't always lay completely flat, and sometimes there are folds that make centering the piercing somewhat difficult.  You should place the piercing centered the way your body naturally lays, not centered when stretched.  I have the same problem with mine.  It's centered when stretched, but not when laying flat.  If it still seems crooked after a jewelry change, you can either take it out and have it redone, or choose to deal with it.  Either way, I would get a second opinion from another piercer.|`|c5anDswjaa	Mine does the same thing, I have a CBR in and it goes from side to side sometimes because it doesnt always sit directly on my clit.. Its kinda like a penis, it doesnt stay in the middle it goes to either side lol|`|JwnHKTabaa	Um, what's a hood peircing???|`|4Qb1FNH2aa	It may be because you are still swollen, I may be because piercing there is hard and they can't always do it exactly straight. Also the position you were in on the table may have been different than the one you are in when you are twisted around to get a look...<br>  <br>  People who get to see it probably won't be checking its symmetry, though. :)|`|wPtjtLycaa	can you post pics and well tell you if it looks straight or not Thanks ;)|`|xwZV9jgPaa	I'd wait a couple weeks for the swelling to go down and then see...if you think about it tho....if its a little tilted....would it really be a big deal?|`|9CN1MZ5Maa	I have this piercing and I absolutely love it!  I have a 14g curved barbell in it.  I was told that the rings would not be comfortable for this piercing.  Sometimes it tilts to the left side a little (during fun time mostly).  But for the most part, it stays centered.  Yours is probably normal but it wouldn't hurt though to go to a different piercer and get it checked out.
2dya7YeKaa	First off: I am not trying to be a jerk but "gauge" is a measurement.  The part of your ear you are referring to is a piercing.  So you STRETCHED your PIERCINGS to a larger GAUGE.  Your piercings tore and got infected.  Not your gauges.<br>  <br>  Now to your question: You absolutely can.  <br>  <br>  The problem you ran into is that you stretched too fast. You are also not supposed to wear tapers as jewelry.  Tapers are meant to ease your new jewelry in and nothing more, they aren't meant to be worn long term (the problems with doing that are outlined perfectly in your question).  Stretching should never cause bleeding.  Here is a timeline for how long you should wait between gauges:<br>  <br>  16g to 14g - 1 month<br>  14g to 12g - 1 month<br>  12g to 10g - 1.5 months<br>  10g to 8g - 2 months<br>  8g to 6g - 3 months<br>  6g to 4g - 3 month<br>  4g to 2g - 3 months<br>  2g to 0g - 4 months<br>  0g to 00g - 4 months<br>  <br>  You cannot skip gauges.  <br>  <br>  In between gauges the best thing to do is to wear good jewelry (steel or glass is GREAT for healing a fresh stretch) and to take good care of your lobes.  The best way to do that is to do sea salt soaks on fresh stretches (for about a week or two I'd say) and then once the piercings have "settled" after the stretch, to start doing oil massages.  <br>  <br>  Oil massages (done daily or every other day) with pure emu oil or vitamin e oil will help promote healthy tissue growth and keep your lobes thick and healthy.  Apart from oil massages I like to put lotion on my lobes once or twice a day.  Using something unscented that soaks in nicely works great (I use St. Ives or Aveeno).  <br>  <br>  The forum at Bodyartforms.com is full of fabulous information from people experienced in these matters - go and check it out.  The site is a body jewelry retailer that has a wide selection at really reasonable prices.|`|ofrHk6eiaa	That happens when the ear stretches more than it can handle so it tears and usually leads to infection if not treated properly.<br>  <br>  Yes you can make them bigger again.<br>  <br>  Be careful and you might want to rub a bit of lotion or something on the taper so it can go through the hole easier and smoothly.<br>  <br>  Goodluck! :)|`|585ab0776084269babf0060c20972036aa	Yes, but you will have to take it very slow and easy.  You probably have some scar tissue that will make your stretches difficult.  You should never wear tapers as jewelry.  The best way to stretch is to wear appropriate jewelry at your current size for 2-3 months, then use a taper to gently stretch up to the next size.  Then again put in appropriate jewelry for your new size.  Stretching is a long, slow process that can seriously screw up your ears if done incorrectly.  Only go up 1 size at a time, and give yourself 2-3 months to heal between stretches.  If you try to stretch and it hurts or there seems to be a lot of resistance, you need to wait a little longer before you try to stretch again.  If it hurts, bleeds, or oozes excessively, you were not ready for the next size.

hwRdT156aa	sorry you've ruint it, the only other thing you can do is get a perm.|`|f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa	You've damaged your hair with heat, but I hope you've tried to mitigate the damage by using a heat protectant product during that time. Stop using heat and start showing your hair some TLC like weekly deep conditioning treatments. Some people's hair bounce back after several months and for other's the damage is permanent. If it's permanent then you can choose to live with the damage or cut it off little-by-little as your hair grows in or all at once. It's up to you what you do. <br>  <br>  I've never heard of hair changing every 7 years, or so. Your hair can permanently change when you go through puberty and it can also change with the type of medication you take and hormone changing events like child birth, but it doesn't change just for the heck of it.|`|UojyaVglaa	the lack of curls is likely caused by the damage you've done to you hair by applying heat to it constantly. damaged hair will lay differently then your healthy hair did. you'll have to slowly cut the damaged hair off until it's replaced with new growth. also keep in mind that ever 7 years or so the texture of your hair changes. just because you had really curly hair years ago doesn't mean you will forever.|`|ESAMvi4taa	Your hair is crying out for help and moisture.

8pZBZG7Iaa	Choose clothes that flatter you: they should fit, and be neat and clean with a crisp appearance. Ask a friend or a sales' assistant if you're not sure that an outfit suits you. <br>  <br>  Always have a few outfits prepared in advance, that way you won't have to spend lots of time riffling through your closet for certain events.<br>   <br>  Choose your clothes in advance and try them out before the day when you want to wear them.<br>   <br>  Choose what you like. If you enjoy dressing preppy, a polo or two are a must. Enjoy what you wear; clothing should be fun. <br>  <br>  Keep up with the latest trends, so that you know what's current and what isn't. Check fashion magazines and put your own twist on things!<br>   <br>  Add a couple of accessories - for example, a watch, necklace, ribbon or belt.  <br>  <br>  Know that good quality shoes are a must. Wear something that matches your personal style as well as the outfit you are wearing. <br>  <br>  Don't go over the top (for example, don't wear all leopard print). <br>  Try not to look fake; don't wear something if it's not you. <br>  <br>  Be daring and unique! if you like leopard print, maybe go for a leopard print headband. Try interesting combinations, like a dress with jeans or shorts and tights. Don't be afraid to experiment. <br>  <br>  Go for variety. For example, if you like pink, try different shades, not just bubblegum pink; there's dusty pink, baby pink, hot pink, etc. <br>  <br>  Buy more than one pair of jeans; a dressy pair, a casual pair, an 'outdoors' pair (especially handy when camping), and an 'at home' pair. Jeans are lifesavers, especially on those days that you can't find anything to wear. Try jeans with any top, a cute pair of shoes, maybe a belt, and off you go! <br>  <br>  Mix 'n' match from previous seasons. <br>  <br>  Black pants and denim are compulsory! <br>  <br>  Check thrift stores and discount outlets, style shouldn't be expensive. <br>  Make sure you have Outfits: that means clothes that go well with each other. <br>  <br>  Sometimes its better to go for quality than quantity. Better to have one outfit with really great quality than two outfits which fall apart after a couple washings.|`|AA11280073	Watch What Not to Wear on Fri nights.|`|ykH93Wyxaa	stop getting dressed in the dark<br>  look in the mirror before you leave the house|`|yEaf6d0Jaa	I'm sure you don't dress that bad!

g3IXprk9aa	Hey there,<br>  <br>  You really don't need to be using anti-wrinkle/firming cream for your face. You are young for that and there is no need for it. Also, you are still growing and developing, that means your skin is too. <br>  <br>  Since you grew up where there is hot sun beating down on your face, the best thing you need is a sun-screen. That will help you fight off wrinkles, dark spots, freckles, everything. It will help you have amazing skin for when you are older.<br>  <br>  Here are some products featured on sephora for help protect skin from the sun along with making your skin be amazing...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://sephora.com/browse/section.jhtml?categoryId=C152" rel="nofollow">http://sephora.com/browse/section.jhtml?...</a><br>  <br>  You should look into getting a nice moisturizer, that's so important for you, and will help keep your young skin in great shape, you can look at some here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://sephora.com/browse/section.jhtml?categoryId=S15115" rel="nofollow">http://sephora.com/browse/section.jhtml?...</a><br>  <br>  You also can search from price low to high, or high to low, along with top sellers, and read reviews. So you really can't go wrong with getting anything on Sephora. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps a bit, good luck, all the best! :-)|`|ZSirHSGmaa	vesin its and indian thing it helps get rid of wrinkles ,acne, and makes your face glowy .....<br>  just ask any indian person,,,it really works you leave the soultion on for 30 min and it gets really hard and you cant talk but then just go take a shower and it comes off with a little scrubbing and it doesnt have any side effects|`|ZjYLTdovaa	really tho?<br>  <br>  no you shouldnt because the creams arent going to do anything. its not like it stores up in your skin waiting for the day you get your first wrinkle. in fact, all the extra pulling at your skin from rubbing this stuff in is going to give you wrinkles faster and when you really need it to work, your skin is going to be soooo acclimated to the active ingredients in these products that they will have no effect.|`|m8alP5kPaa	Anti-wrinkle cream is probably not necessary at this point, BUT there are other ways you can take care of your skin to avoid wrinkles later...other lotions that protect from the suns rays ect..|`|kUE3Ddktaa	You are too young for anti-wrinkle creams - the best way to prevent wrinkles is to use sunscreen! Put SPF 30 on your face every time you leave the house, even if it's cloudy, and try to limit the time you spend laying out in the sun. <br>  <br>  UV rays break down the collagen in your skin, which then leads to wrinkles. Keeping the UV rays off your face will help prevent wrinkles.|`|21fee98831946197f4886f287f0a38c1aa	Not yet.  But make sure you use plenty of sun-screen when you go outside.  If you face is not too oily, you may want to start using moisturizer at bedtime.|`|1FqJyyjaaa	You need to a use a daily moisturizer that has SPH in it.  Using a daily SPH of at least 20 in your moisturizer will prevent wrinkles from coming too early.  Wear sunglasses when outdoors even if there's no real sun, because that will help stop the forming of wrinkles in your eye area.  <br>  <br>  I'm 25 and I don't even use anti-wrinkle creams yet.  You don't really need to start using them until late 20s early 30s, so I couldn't even recommend a cream for you.|`|2v60zG5Faa	lmao x ure 14! they're for old people xxx u won't get wrinkles in ure teens lol spots yes but not wrinkles stop worrying xxx<br>  n heat doesn't cause wrinkles x just put loads of suncream on xx|`|uy6sBhipaa	No. Stay out of the sun and don't overeat.  8>)|`|vtW3qPZmaa	Don't use anti-wrinkle stuff yet - it's way too rich for teen skin and will probably make you break out.  Once your hormones have settled down a bit (early 20's) then think about upping your moisturiser.  For now something light and oil free will help you more than anything else, providing moisture without being too heavy and upping your sebum production.  Also make sure to use something with an spf to avoid sun damage.<br>  <br>  And honestly, even if you do nothing you won't have wrinkles in your 30's... 30 isn't ancient you know, it takes a bit longer than that for the collagen and elastin in your skin to start to break down.  Be sensible - always cleanse and moisturise your face before bed and when you get up, NEVER sleep in make up, use a sunscreen, don't smoke (major cause of premature wrinkling), keep yourself hydrated, and eat lots of fruit and veg.
vtW3qPZmaa	Being told what to think - too many people in this world take what their parents/friends/the media say at face value.  People need to learn to research both sides of any argument and make an informed decision on a topic based on rational thinking and logic - not just follow the popular view or jumping on a bandwagon because it's easy.<br>  <br>  In short - teens should seek independent thought.  Just because your parents are racist, it doesn't mean you have to be; just because your friends are homophobic, it doesn't mean you have to be; you don't have to fear things you don't understand... get out there and educate yourself so you do understand.|`|0pJAXEXCaa	From...uh....<br>  <br>  1)Wearing boring clothes because everyone else does (the PUBLIC schools have a uniform too!

Mpl6auhBaa	I think I know what type of earring back you're talking about. What usually works for me is to remove it by digging my fingernail and thumbnail into the space between the earring back and the earlobe, trapping the back between my finger and thumb, using my other hand to hold my earlobe still, and then firmly pulling backwards. In desperate situations, you can try simply yanking the earring front forward, but I would definitely not recommend this for recently pierced ears; I wouldn't risk the earlobe ripping.|`|ba4Gnh1faa	never got my ears pierced there but MAYBE try twisting.<br>  sounds like that might be good.

vRZolfOraa	Well you probably don't need us lot here to tell you that colouring is not too good for your hair and bleaching is definately not!<br>  <br>  Firstly for the split ends - pop into you hairdressers or local salon and get a trim, getting rid of the split ends will promote healthy hair growth.<br>  <br>  Shampoo - Try and get a shampoo and conditioner that is specially formulated for dry/brittle/damaged hair. These are usually deep conditioning. A leave in conditioner or hair mask that is used regularly (every was for conditioner and ever other for a mask) will help to restore some of the damage done to your hair. If you find that conditioner makes your hair too greasy too quickly then just use it on the ends of your hair and avoid the roots. I find that herbal essances are brilliant!<br>  <br>  As for straightening, always remember to use a protective or heat defense spray. For this I can reccommend Tresseme.<br>  <br>  You also probably don't need telling that it might be a good idea to stop bleaching and dying your hair for a while - until you get it restored to healthiness! If you cannot wait then make sure you talk to your hairdresser about something a bit less drastic than bleaching, maybe subtle blonde highlights over your existing hair colour?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  xxx|`|JGxemN3waa	I've been a hair stylist for over 5 years and I've NEVER heard anyone describe their hair as "Stretchy"<br>  <br>  Are you sure you don't mean "Stringy" ?<br>  <br>  The best reconstructing shampoo I know of is called K-Pack made by Joico.

It does sound like u have a problem with your hair. Which is completely normal when people die there hair or bleach it too much. Now the first step is getting your hair healthy again. u know, good food, exersize, and that good stuff. Then u need to get a trim to get rid of your split ends. I would recommmend using fructis shampoo. It is a great shampoo for damaged hair. I hope i helped u. But just make sure u do NOT bleach or dye your hair AGAIN! Your hair can actually fall out.|`|67KpgnVfaa	STOP STRAIGHTENING! and blow drying if you can help it. Use a deep conditioner to try and put some moisture back into it.

Colouring isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be, lol. Bleaching is...but i'm sure you'll be fine.<br>  <br>  Get a good or deep conditioner (herbal essences is good =]) and put in your hair dry, lots of it. Leave it on for an hour or however long you can, maybe even overnight, and that will help alot. Might make your hair a little greasy though, just shampoo it. Olive oil works too, but thats definitely gunna make it greasy.<br>  <br>  Also, now you've bleached your hair, it will be more brittle and easier to straighten, turn the heat down a little.|`|XN0cYCATaa	Try Using Alberto VO 5 Hairdressing, Watch These Videos.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6868477555999981944&q=Alberto+VO5+Commercials&ei=9YeISJasGo6g4ALkyKjGCA&hl=en" rel="nofollow">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.expotv.com/videos/reviews/3/42/AlbertoVO5ConditioningHairdressing2/171951" rel="nofollow">http://www.expotv.com/videos/reviews/3/4...</a>|`|LBg4DNpCaa	There is a leave in conditioner from patene pro v or however you spell it that is in a tub.

You'll never be to 'repair' it, once it's completely frazzled there's nothing much you can do. Put Mayonnaise on your hair about once a month. If you hair is extremely dry, do it twice a month. It conditions your hair, I use it and it's great.

STOP trying to put the barbell back in, you've left it out for way to long and it wasn't healed, you are only going to screw it up more if you keep trying. You need to see a Dr at this point, you most likely will need oral antibiotics, you may also need the area drained.|`|H6rPxpHWaa	Wash your hands. Wash your hands with an antibacterial soap before touching your infected eyebrow piercing. Only touch it as necessary and try to minimize hitting or bumping it with your hand, hair brush or other objects. <br>  Step<br>  2Clean it. Clean it several times a day with Bactine. Bactine is not only an antiseptic, but it also contains Lidocain that acts as a topical anaesthetic. Do not use alcohol because it is harsh and drying and can cause more irritation. <br>  Step<br>  3Use a warm compress. Apply a warm compress to the infected area that has been soaked in water mixed with sea salt. Leave it on until it cools then warm it up again. Repeat this process for up to 30 minutes. <br>  Step<br>  4Soak the infected eyebrow piercing in a warm saline solution. Mix a pinch of sea salt with very warm water and use a shot glass to hold the mixture around the infected area. Keep a bottle of commercial saline solution in the shower to clean any remaining shampoo or soap residue off your eyebrow piercing. <br>  Step<br>  5Apply an antibacterial ointment. Generously apply an antibacterial ointment to the infected eyebrow piercing. Repeat Steps 1 through 5 daily until the infection clears.|`|de28048ab10e261734a9e1e41461c18aaa	maybe your body is rejecting it

If you want to use Tea Tree it's ok but make sure you mix it with water first. It will dry the skin out which can help.<br>  <br>  I would recommend a cleanser that has more natural ingredients, and one for oily skin so it doesn't dry your skin out. <br>  <br>  There's a fantastic alternative product for acne which work for me everytime, if you can access them- Collodial Silver Gel or spray (Kills the bacteria in the pimple and stops it from being able to replicate therefore helps stop future pimples from appearing)- You can find this often in health food stores.<br>  <br>  Also it's important to look at your diet- Make sure you drink alot of water for detox and see if you are having too much of the one product- For example wheat or sugar or dairy- They block your system up and cause your body to detox through your skin.

I have known a LOT of women and the same thing always happens to them. You have not found the right hairdresser yet, believe me, when you do, you will know, there won't be any doubt. The problem is that you will probably have to wait 6 months to get an appointment.<br>  *<br>  Most hairdressers just do not have a clue.<br>  *<br>  Good luck. U R not crazy. U R right on and absolutely right. They do not cut your hair the way you want.|`|UojyaVglaa	you have to keep in mind that you could do the same EXACT cut on 100 people and everyone's hair would turn out differently. if you dont have the same exact hair type, length, and texture of the model in the picture your hair will look radically different than the one in the pic. this is not the fault of your styllist, but perhaps she should have explained this to you beforehand.|`|7JQDQJe0aa	say that you get really annoyed when it doesnt come out right and most of the time it does<br>  tell them to make sure they do it they way you want and not the way they want|`|kGRbeiYtaa	Bring in a picture everyone pictures things differently. or find a different hair stylist if she wont do that type of cut,|`|E4f7E1Gnaa	well i would take the picture of the hairstyle you would want , and if they are a decent hairdressers they should respect your decsion and hopefully do that look on you !|`|ESAMvi4taa	You may need to switch stylists if she has repeatedly not been open to giving you what you want.  Bringing in pictures is extremely helpful.  Pictures of what you want AS WELL AS what you don't want|`|350cc6173ffb629f134cb3e382d77470aa	show her the picture and just tell her what you want|`|Ma8yn56vaa	tell  them straightup|`|bQSjtjgQaa	I had the same problem, a hair coloring chick messed up my  hair the first time I went in. so I went back and that time I took a photoshoped picture of my hair how I wanted and I graphed out the areas I wanted colored and what color I wanted them, and while it still came out ok it wasn't how I wanted cause the hair dresser had her own opinion and I just let her keep going because I don't like confrontation. So if while they are working on your hair you think you don't like something, tell them, remember that your paying for the styling and that you're going to be the one livening with it, and just be picky and stop them if you don't like it or the way they are doing it. You could also look around on google or yahoo with your zip code for local hairdressers and read the reviews people give them, maybe see pics of there previous work, I'm always asking for that before I let any one touch my hair from now on. If they are professional they will have a portfolio of their past work.<br>  Good luck?
MYRm9nMbaa	Just this week I took my wedding band in to the jewelry store where it was purchased for cleaning. They buffed so hard, it turned yellow. I gave it back to them and they re-plated it on the spot, no charge involved.|`|98b98bd5749baadc8ce32ff1f2759dceaa	i have had two white gold rings for over 20 years..they have never faded or needed "redipped"...they must put some kind of plating on white gold now days....i think reeds jewelers re-dips for $5
gqKpbIIGaa	I have personal experience with tattoos and tanning.  All of my tattoos look amazing!  One colorful tattoo that is 7 years old only looks to have aged 1 year.<br>  <br>  I would say that 6 weeks is a perfect healing time.  I have normally pale skin and I tan easily due to my heritage.  I use a tanning bed and I have had NO PROBLEMS with my tattoos or with fading.  This though will be different person to person depending on their skin type and genetics. (Personally my skin holds ink well, even white!) So I'm not sure how well my advice will hold up , like I said to other skin types.  Also I use tanning lotion in the beds, and do not use SPF as to not get discoloration of my skin around my tattoos to keep things even.  Even when I'm not tanning and pale again (like now) my tattoos still have all of their color.<br>  <br>  I hope that this helps in your decision.|`|ft8t98Pnaa	The more you tan, the more the ink fades and slowly goes from brilliant to boring. <br>  <br>  Does that mean your tanning days are over? Well, I guess that depends on how much you love your tattoos and want them to stay bright and looking their best. I can certainly empathize with anyone that also loves the sun and just can't stay away. If you absolutely must go soak up some rays, at least be sensible and use sun block. Find the highest SPF level you can find and re-apply often if you're going to spend a lot of time outside. If you just can't accept having pasty white skin and your goal is to go out and get some color, make sure you at least protect your tattoos with as much sunscreen as possible<br>  Indoor tanners are just as damaging as the sun, if not more so. The ultraviolet rays are much more concentrated and people tend to over-expose themselves in tanning beds, not realizing their own limits. Burning the skin damages a tattoo even more than slowly tanning. Again, if you must do it, protect your ink! <br>  <br>  Don't put sunblock on a new or fresh tattoo - follow your artist's aftercare instructions and keep your tattoo covered or shaded with clothing for the first few weeks. You can use sunblock once your tattoo has finished peeling and has grown it's first protective layer of skin. But sunblock alone is not going to be sufficient for a new tattoo if it is exposed to direct sunlight for long periods of time. A tattoo is usually considered well-healed after about 3 months. <br>  <br>  If you use sunless tanning lotions for a tanned effect, this is as safe to your tattoo as applying any other type of lotion. As long as the tattoo is completely healed, nothing can hurt the tattoo that doesn't hurt the rest of your skin. However, depending on the shade and color of the particular sunless tanning lotion you use, it may create an odd effect to your tattoo's appearance. It would make more sense just to avoid putting the lotion directly over the tattoo. <br>  <br>  Your tattoo is an investment, so don't gamble on that investment by not properly caring for it. It takes very little effort to either cover up or safeguard your tattoo with sunscreen. Proper care can keep a tattoo looking vibrant for years to come.|`|Xtqq71KGaa	if it's healed (by now it should be) it's OK to go ahead and tan.  the big issue is getting the tattoo dirty (as in sweat) before it's healed.
UojyaVglaa	it's not that the color absorbs better with it dirty. it's that the natural oils in your hair help protect it during the coloring process, and keep it from getting more damaged than necessary.|`|9gMQAWBNaa	My understanding of not washing your hair before you dye it ,is that the natural oils present in your hair after a few days, prevent the dye from damaging your hair as much as it would if your hair had just been washed.|`|BSuO6CQvaa	your going to the hair dressers, but on boxes of dye bought at the supermarket, some of them give you a shampoo combined with hair dye, im guessing you should wash your hair first...|`|4fded85bb017fba5407e3727176079ffaa	I have had my hair colored for years.

Uxe1GjP0aa	Overall japanese girls have it easy: they are not hairy, they have beautiful complexion naturally and their eyebrows are nicely defined. I don't think they have to worry much about growing a moustache or a goatee. Let us not forget that Japan is filled with street fashion-forward people who are not afraid to use some color in their wardrobe. And they have some of the most fantastic print silks in the world.<br>  If they need to further define their eyebrows, I believe they use a silk thread to do it.|`|15QLqt0haa	They are wearing eyelash extentions or having an eylash enhancement.<br>  We, Japanese garls, spend lot of mony on own eyelashes !!!!!!!!|`|fsrLp3HMaa	cuz their eyebrow hair is thin and they have it easy hahaha|`|HHniTZTbaa	dunno but its not fair ;)|`|y5iJ50nxaa	its what there trained for|`|L3PiQ0GLaa	lol they work on it til its perfect before leaving the house lol<br>  <br>  but other girls do it too ;p<br>  but yea i have seen a lot of nice ones|`|PdzXM51Laa	Asians do stuff like that the best...|`|a6j0cwgqaa	Japanese girls are GORGEOUS period!!!

I learnt that the hard way , if you have some hair after you wax it , then tweeze it.<br>  Argos have this product that permanelty removes hair from the root ! By using smal currents of eletricity ! It hurts a lil the first time , but after that it's painless , i think you should go for it ! it's only 20 quid . I can' help you remove the scabs or help it get better , but i have told you how to prevent it . Oh yh apply talcum powder before you wax , as this helps the wax grip onto the hair better , also makesure the area you wax is free from oil and grease as the wax simply won't remove the hair . Hope this helps , and if you find a way then let us know ! xxx|`|n6IBfiDPaa	ugh, ive had that. it hurts<br>  Sounds like you really are doing everything you can..<br>  You may want to put some Neosporin on it as well.

Now I think I am at least in a situation when I can help some one. On each Wednesday and Friday there is a market held where I live, and for the last few weeks some body is holding a stall selling Plastic Tailors dummies, the cost, amazingly is ￡2 each if you buy 2 the price is ￡3.If you live around Hayes (Middlesex) about 5 miles from Heathrow this place is ideal for you.

Then it should be "set"<br>  Now your partner slits the cast up the back and you wriggle out trying not to disturb the shape too much.<br>  Stick the slit back together with more brown parcel tape and leave it somewhere to dry overnight.<br>  In the next day or two, varnish the cast so that it is really stiff and solid.  Mine was actually bright red because we found a tin of red gloss paint in the cupboard.<br>  When the varnish dries you will have a dummy which is your own shape for just a few quid.
uANkyR2aaa	First of all, good on you for choosing a brown suit. Most people reject brown suits immediately, but they often look very stylish.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you have a fairly high-contrast complexion, so you're going to want to underscore that with a contrasting outfit. <br>  <br>  A dark brown suit like the one you've picked goes well with a variety of colours -- tan, gold, yellow -- but for a contrasting look, go with a medium blue shirt. Choose something like this: <a href="http://www.execstyle.com/products/Shirts/lipson/2960-6072-ES-BLUE-A.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.execstyle.com/products/Shirts...</a><br>  <br>  Couple that with a rich burgundy tie that incorporates some of the blue of the shirt in it, like this one: <a href="http://cls.scene7.com/is/image/cls/11680?$cls_page$&fmt=jpg&mode=page" rel="nofollow">http://cls.scene7.com/is/image/cls/11680...</a><br>  <br>  Pair it with a nice pair of cordovan wintips and you're set. <br>  <br>  For more help with picking clothes that suit you and finding the best deals on menswear, visit my blog at <a href="http://clothingbargains.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://clothingbargains.blogspot.com/</a>|`|HMhUKAgkaa	yellow, orange, pink, blue, white, pretty much anything but black|`|4bWUiIVdaa	A white shirt and a yellow tie|`|92yiQo7uaa	Wear a white shirt and a tan or gold or blue tie.

MYPMoVg4aa	People don't understand that fashion can be so simple.<br>  It's just a matter or colour, layers and knowing what looks best with what.<br>  <br>  Buy a few magazines and have a look at all the different fashions and colours that are in the season, if you don't want to be the same as everyone else i suggest you go into second hand stores and take a look at vintage pieces that you can mix and match.<br>  If not then go into stores like urban outfitters and topshop,<br>  wear skinny jeans with t.shirts and long cardigans.<br>  or dresses with different coloured tights.<br>  frills are pretty big this season. <br>  on the evening wear metallics and black colours and during the day wear soft pastel colours. start to create your own look and sooner or later you'll become a fashionista. Wear what you want to wear and what makes you feeel most comfortable.|`|qkLqlW4Caa	clothes that fit your body really well and now and then sweats that are really comfy and if your prep bright clothes and if not then clothes that are in from like the mall or something <br>  <br>  p.s. not all clothes that are stylishy are expensive :)<br>  <br>  and if you want stores:<br>  aeropostale<br>  abercrombie<br>  old navy<br>  hollister<br>  kohls (haha)<br>  forever21<br>  and that stuff :))|`|sS65j9Wraa	Now, i first heard this from roberto cavali...."look where you have always looked, get what you have always got!"<br>  E.g. If you have always looked for fashion inspiration from people walking down the street, and aren't happy with your style, look for inspiration elsewhere!! VOGUE/old record album sleeves/people like Agyness dean/sex and the city!!!!<br>  Or take someone who's style you admire, and has a similar body shape to you and see what they wear ;-)<br>  But for spring/summer09 go for 80's 80's 80's!!! eg acid wash jeans, body con,pearls(like maddona!) <br>  And i love peg-leg trousers and blazers with the sleeves rolled up :)<br>  do some research!!!<br>  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx|`|9X8zhza5aa	First and foremost, keep your hair maintained. People see your face first when they meet you, so if your head looks good any disasters with your clothes won't seem so bad. :)<br>  <br>  Once that is taken care of find clothes that fit & flatter you before you go out and buy anything expensive. I like to start by checking my measurements against the sizing guides in online stores, which helps me know what sizes are likely to fit in case my weight has changed.<br>  <br>  Think about what is your best feature and how you want to show it off. For example if you think you have a good neck & shoulders then try to draw attention to your upper body. If you have good legs wear skirts and slim pants. And tailored looks flatter just about everybody.<br>  <br>  Finally if you are nervous about taking fashion risks, just stick to clothes with classic style, maybe paired with exciting shoes or accessories.|`|HHniTZTbaa	I wouldn't just go to some shops and feel pressured.<br>  Clothes should be comfy and you should like what you are wearing :)<br>  You could look at some magazines and just cut out any clothes/outfits of what you like.<br>  It could be your style bible ~ anything you like or feel inspired by, you could stick it in.<br>  If you see things like that in shops buy them.<br>  Accessories really tie an outfit together.<br>  Like if you wore even jeans and a top.<br>  Say it was a dark blue pair of jeans and a green top.<br>  A brown belt, a necklace like something from Accessorize, some rings/bracelets and you'd have a nice outfit.<br>  Play around with whatever you like, and keep an eye out in places like charity shops because they have some really nice vintage stuff.<br>  Good luck :)
585ab0776084269babf0060c20972036aa	It doesn't sound like bruises to me.  You may have some other condition that is causing your skin to darken in spots.  A doctor's visit would be the best course of action at this point.  Even if it is bruising, having them for that long is reason for concern.|`|AA10755311	Bruises shouldn't last any longer then 2 weeks, usually going away in 1. It could be your bra, but if it is, then you need a new bra and to not wear it as tightly, because if it is from your bra, they would be bruises caused by too much pressure for an extended amount of time, and so as I said, ger a new bra and don't wear it as tightly. A doctor's visit is a good idea, it probably isn't anything, but the doctor could have some suggestions. the only other way to make a bruise go away is to make sure there is no pressure or trauma introduced to the area until it is gone. Good Luck!|`|dfMDTTUAaa	whenever i have a sporting injury i always use witchazel. failing that try aloe vera gel|`|DKQ8BcO6aa	make up

oVxr5B3Eaa	Wow, the ONLY city I've been to outside of Canada, what a coincidence! I went there for work over the summer for 8 days but I had tons of time off while I was there. Everything was TOTALLY different from Canada so we had fun doing things that would likely be lame to you. Like we spent half a day at whole foods market. No joke. <br>  <br>  It kind of depends how old you are too. I was 19 when I went, which is legal to drink in Canada, but not in Texas, so I couldn't go in a lot of places. That totally blew. <br>  <br>  Ok, number 1. There is a big bridge in Austin over the river.. The congress bridge I think? Go there about an hour before sunset. There will likely be tons of people around. There is a park there... Just chill. There are tons of bats that live under the bridge. When the sun set, they all fly out. It sounds lame, but it was actually pretty cool. Might be a little too early in the season, it depends on the weather. They start "mid-march" so they might be there, might not.  <br>  <br>  Go to tons of restaurants. The thing I loved about austin was that basically every tex-mex restaurant gave you free nachos, and has live music. Try Chuy's on Barton Springs Road. It was REALLY good. <br>  <br>  If you have a car, go to the Salt Lick. It's like an all you can eat BBQ. <a href="http://www.saltlickbbq.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.saltlickbbq.com/</a> It was pretty sensational though it's outside of Austin. <br>  <br>  Break in to the Omni hotel and go up to the roof. There is a pool and a hot tub up there, and the view is REALLY good. You can see the whole city from the Hot Tub. <br>  <br>  Basically Austin is known for it's live music so take advantage. We went TONS of places to eat, a different one every day, and basically all of them had live music of some sort.<br>  <br>   If you want to go shopping, try 6th street (more bars and stuff) or south congress (more expensive type stuff)<br>  <br>  Sorry, I'm not really an expert because it's been quite awhile since I was there, and I'm from Canada so it was totally culturally different, and I didn't get to see alot of the touristy stuff because I was working through the day time..<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun!|`|N48qV69daa	We are planning on getting a bunch of friends and going down to our cabbin and  party it up!

ff279fcd17fccf6c9be19ea34e7b21b9aa	clarify your hair, then use a purple shampoo, if that still doesn't work...shampoo with regular shampoo then condition with ....yes...ketchup.  the red will neutralize the green.  think of colors on a color wheel.  the colors across form each other will cancel the other out.  a bleach wash is nothing more than bleach used for highlighting your hair, it will damage it.  if it still doesn't work go to your hairdresser and ask for a "soap cap"|`|187c083657d9bad44a324e7c62384f63aa	Why didn't you ask the guy what it was and how much it costs? Or just go to your nearest salon. A bleach wash is a hair bleaching component that is added to your hair when it's in the process of being washed.  It is intened to cover up anything you don't want in your hair, basically stripping the hair color away to it's natural color. Now since you're a natural blonde you're just fine. Putting blonde on top of the green will not make it blonde again it will make it some other color. I wish you the best of luck in getting your hair color back.|`|310f3c1b581559a40b64d0befb52df1eaa	why didnt yuo ask the eprson that told you about it? ditz.

e68d678c0aa412b21073ee7ade031ac6aa	Dont use all black because that will ruin the "smokey" apeal. Use Cover Girl pencil eyeliner 2 in 1 in "charcoal" (one end should be pencil and the other a smudge stick) and line it along under your lashes at the bottom and over your lashes at the top. Then use the smudge part and lightly smear the liner. Next use a dark navy shadow (almost black) and apply to the crease in the eyelid. Then use a gray/navy and apply all over lid.

FplTPoAyaa	Yes, it will lighten after every wash.  You could try washing it several times and see if that helps at all. I would not recommend coloring again so soon. Wait at least 4 weeks.  And do not put lemon juice over top of the coloring..you will end up with orange streaks.|`|owGsQdYraa	It should lighten as it gets washed.<br>  Try washing it everyday for a a week or so using just shampoo, don't use a moisturising one though.|`|611e46e0e7c3eb9e2c5c9a52d2766b0eaa	it probabyly wont lighten up as much as you want it to but ti will get lighter! dont redye ti because it will turn a whole dark and you dont want that! good luck!|`|qhKP68eiaa	It will.

Rn7zkS52aa	it's not great to straighten your hair, but it's good that you only do it twice a week. make sure you use something to protect it before hand. i STRONGLY recommend Aveda smooth infusion style prep smoother. you don't need very much at all and it makes straightening your hair alot easier, makes it shinier. i've been getting tons of compliments since i started using it. it is a little more costly, but the bottle lasts for a really long time. i think i've had my 3.4 oz bottle for 8 or 9 months and i have hair that is 5 inches past my shoulders. also, a tip is to just run the straightening iron over sections of hair only ONCE. the trick is to go slower, but only go over a section one time. the more you go over it, the more damage it creates. also you could benefit from a deep conditoner once a week. you can just buy one from a drugstore, but i would definitely recommend the Aveda stuff i told you about. you can buy it from any aveda store/salon or online at their website.|`|vRZolfOraa	Straightening is obviously not the best thing for your hair! Nor is any other styler that involves subjecting your hair to high temperatures.<br>  <br>  However as long as you take the necessary measures there is no need for your hair to be unhealthy and brittle. Make sure you use a shampoo and conditioner that will nourish your hair - I am sure that nowadays you can buy ones specially formulated for hair that is exposed to excessive heat styling. Also before you use any kind of heat on your hair make sure you protect it with a heat defense (or similar) spray.<br>  <br>  I straighten my hair everyday! Yes EVERYDAY! And when I visit my hairdresser she always comments on the lovely condition of my hair, I apparently have better conditioned hair than some of her clients who do not use straighteners at all! <br>  <br>  So as long as you prepare and protect your lovely locks there is no reason for an unhealthy look! And remember you can always ask your hairdresser for brands that are for heat protection that she/he could recommend.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  xxx|`|UojyaVglaa	Every time you apply heat to your hair you are damaging it. This is the price you pay for straight hair. You can, however, minimize the damage somewhat by applying a heat protector beforehand. This will not keep your hair completely damage free though.|`|qkLqlW4Caa	without heat or iron protection spray or something like it, it will cause damage because of the heat it will eventually fry the ends of your hair and the rest :(|`|49139d951a4134b87ccf7193a9401347aa	ya doin it every day is very harmful for ur hair..<br>  it wil lead to thining of hair..<br>  go for rebonding as itz safe n has longer effect around for 6 months to a year..|`|sMTVcfiVaa	YES straightening is really hard on your hair. The straightener gets up to 400 degrees. You must use a heat protector spray (tresemme is a good one) before you straighten and putting leave in conditioner or serum in after is a good idea. Don't straighten every day. Put it up on the days you don't straighten if you don't like it curly/wavy. Twice a week is okay. Every day is too much. Even three or four times a week is ok, as long as you protect your hair and you condition A LOT. Be careful how you do the straightening, too, because hair can break if you put the heat too high and  you leave it on the hair too long. It's a very delicate process, but with practice, you'll get it and your hair won't even know the difference. :)|`|AQxqS7Kyaa	Yes everytime you straighten it it's ruins your hair-i suggest buying heat protection.

U9QSOLUtaa	Yes, it will be fine to wet it. I have gotten a straight perm, and I did wet before the two days with an okay from my stylist, and the perm lasted fine. Your hair should spring back up nicely once it's dry.|`|qhKP68eiaa	No.  Part of it is letting the chemicals set into your hair, locking the curl in.  Even wetting it can release the chemicals.

0xU9Bhb2aa	Realize that because you are a blonde it is more likely the temp dye will stain your hair.  As long as the color isn't too different from your original you should be fine, especially if you already have amber highlights.  The worse that can happen is you will have a tint left over.  Might be a good idea to figure out what dye is closest to your natural color in case you need to dye it back.|`|zlXofrG4aa	Temporary dye is still going to stain your hair.  Your hair will never go back to it's normal colour unless you bleach and dye it back.  Sure, the temp colour will fade but it will never go completely away.  Especially since blonde hair is so light and it's easily stained because it pretty much has no pigment (which is what makes it blonde).|`|lYIijzpQaa	I'm also a natural blonde, and I have always been very hesitant with temporary dyes. This comes from summers of having green-tinted hair from swimming pools. However, I've heard from numerous friends that temporary dyes work, they look great and they wash out completely. I'd give it a try! Good luck.

814d67dfb8d8da001562ba0c89bd3e0eaa	Wow, that sounds JUST like my hair. Do a birds nest with it! That would be cute. Thats where you take little sections of your hair and twist it until it scrunches and loops up and pin in there with a bobby pin or hair clip. Do that all over your head, it may take some time but it is definently cool and crazy. Also you could put the top half of your hair into a loose ponytail and flip the ponytail itself over and upward through the base of your ponytail. Pull it tight and then tease was sticking up or just sleek it down on both sides. It is cute and I kinda invented it myself.<br>  If you want to get it cut then go for layers!<br>  If you just want more styles then go for sideways high ponytail that are pulled enough to the side so that it shows that YOU MEANT for it to be that way(or else ppl may think you just did it crooked) I think that messy buns are cute but they are hard to upkeep...sorta.

5yISR0iyaa	Avoid Mall chain stores. They tend to hire new recruits fresh out of beauty school. The best way to find a good stylist is to ask around. Don't be afraid to stop someone on the street that has fantastic hair. Ask them where they got it done. Word of mouth is the best reference and seeing the stylists work on someone's hair is the best way to see how they work.  If you liked the hair cut you previously got then go back to that stylist. If it was good but not fabulous then ask around. Also check citysearch for the best of salons. They kind of give you a starting point. Try and take pictures in when you see a new stylist. Dont' be afraid to ask for bits and pieces from several different pictures or to tell the stylist that you want this area or that area longer on your own hair. Being able to show them on your head where you want the longest layer and where you want the shortest layer also helps. If the stylist just wants to start cutting with no conversation prior then leave. They are going to cut it how they want, not how you want. Communication is the key to getting a fabulous hair cut.|`|iYyzJjbaaa	not at the mall. ask one of your friends or a family member if there is any one they can recomend|`|21ccedc70aa91986007a72267be9f99daa	go to hollywood. awesome hair dressers|`|5ca285ebc94390c4b884c56308642449aa	Once you find a stylist that makes you happy stick with him /her.

KsS90aczaa	Yes, it is a good school also look for John Casablancs (spelling on that one)...make sure you aren't paying to be a model, you might want to pay to take classes but you don't want to be paying for comp cards and things like that. For about 3 years I was a model scout for a local school in CT. Be really honest w/ your self, can u really model....you might want to post a pic on yahoo answers here, or email your specs and pics and I can tell you if it's something I think you should spend money on. Honestly. It also depends on what type of modeling your looking at doing...is it print (like jcpenny etc) or more like runway. Print isn't tooo hard, just have to be marketable. If ur looking for runway, you need to be at least 5'8" at min. Tall and Thin. Good skin and tone, equal proportations etc.  If your looking for plus size modeling the highest usually is size 12-14 and this is not the real plus size. Email some headshots and body shots and your bust, waist and height. Weight is extremely important and so is age. If it's something your going to "invest" in you must either must be able to have a flexable schedule or a parent who is going to car you around to shoots. Also important is where you live...are u in the middle of no where? Rural America or are u closer to major citys...ie. NYC, BOSTON, MIAMI, LA,  etc. All of this is important. Shoot me an email with the things I asked for and I will give u a trained professional opinion. I found a girls on the soap Y&R and a girl who has modeled for Coso and Teen.  My email is j.rehm@jillrehm.com<br>  Good LUCK! :) xo's JILL|`|5c9bc42f1a7ff2613e93c1fcf840204eaa	For the record, there is no such thing as a good modelling school...if you want to be a model, you shouldn't have to pay for the honour. <br>  <br>  Send your photos into modeling agencies, go fro open castings, but don't waste your money on these schools!

It does get on clothes, but it washes out.|`|1958b4e7b7296a984ff7f5718ee0b6d1aa	I switched from anti perspirant (alluminum) like 10 years ago. You probably want the anti perspirant effect(dry pits) but not the alluminum it is not really out there, but your body will produce less sweat after awhile of not using it. as for deodorant when I switched I heard most of mens deodorants are non anitperspirant and tried the speed stick one that was unscented and it worked fine. I then switched to the crystal rock which is basically salt. then for a while i would use bakingsoda which takes away the smell but it makes you sweat a bit more than normal, now I only use deod. a few times a month when my hormones produce a smell, I use some rubbing alcohol to kill the bacteria smell and sometimes some bakingsoda or just babypowder. you can also use sage (the herb) it dries up tissue/pores and helps produce less sweat but is hard to find, ask some places may be able to order it for you or you could get the grocery store type and see if it helps(haven't heard much on that food grade product)

But she can afford them...<br>  <br>  They don't last any longer than the drugstore styles.  I've had the best luck finding the middle ground at Sally's.

Any other brand will let you down.<br>  <br>  Don't use mascara over the lashes, and they'll last much longer.  You can carefully pull off the old adhesive and re-use your lashes a few times.

Follow these tips to try and reduce it as much as possible. <br>  <br>  Steps<br>   <br>  Try to identify when the hair loss started and if you changed anything with your hair. For example if you started straightening it or if you started applying lots of mousse. It is likely that this could be the reason. If you find it was due to the use of these things then stop using them. <br>  <br>  Stick to one shampoo or shower gel. If it is repeatedly changed it could cause damage to your hair as shampoos aren't natural, you would be adding more and more chemical products in your hair which could damage them and cause them to fall out. <br>  <br>  Oiling the hair also helps with coconut oil for example. By doing this, when you go out the pollution in the environment won't stick straight onto your hair and damage it. It will stick to the oil instead which can be washed off when you get home. <br>  <br>  Wash your hair regularly, unclean hair could contain lots of damaging things. Frequent washing can help keep hair clean and healthy. <br>  <br>  Wash your hair with warm to normal temperature water. Water which is too hot can also damage the hair. <br>  <br>  Try and reduce stress or anxiety that is getting to you. Tension and anxiety do not help as you will be so worried your body won't be mentally healthy so this will lead to physical deterioration too which includes hair loss. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Tips <br>  Try not to use straighteners, curlers or other chemical products such as dyes excessively, these can damage your hair if used too frequently. <br>  <br>  Oiling your hair can help keep hair healthier. <br>  <br>  Stick to one shampoo or gel. <br>  <br>  As you get older, your hair gets weaker so don't be too worried if a few strands of hair falling occasionally. <br>  <br>  Try to relax and have an optimistic view on things. A healthy mind leads to a healthy body. <br>  <br>  Doing 'Headstand' pose of yoga for about a minuite daily reduces the hair fall. But please consult your doctor before doing this pose. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Warnings <br>  If you have tried all of the above methods and nothing seems to be working, see your doctor as in some cases it could be a symtom of a more serious problem.|`|f487f18235ac897bddf905cc87e5b19faa	.|`|AA12253534	change your shamoop and use olives oil three time a week|`|g4O44XBraa	olive oil + skin of garlic to be boiled and make the paste of it and apply for continusly for a month rapid progress will appear|`|hPl2HzmBaa	Don't comb the wet hair, it will prevent the 90% of the hair fall.|`|9hFTsw7Qaa	eat sulphur rich foods lik onion daily..<br>  and also massage your hair with oil daily<br>  have oil bath twice a week<br>  this really works..<br>  but please take care to apply oil on your hair daily|`|j3kyqxGRaa	there is a drug called <<MINOXIDIL>>(im not sure about the spelling).try it.but dont forget , if you stop useing it you'll lose your hairs more than before.|`|rdZpnHZdaa	I was also feeling very bad about my hair loss.

According to wikipedia, it is the chemical treatment of hair to produce curls.  In 1938, Arnold F. Willatt invented the cold wave, the precursor to the modern perm. It used no machines and no heat. The hair was wrapped on rods and a reduction lotion was applied ammonium thioglycolate. This chemical breaks open the disulfide linkages between the polypeptide bonds in the keratin (the protein structure) in the hair. The disulfide bonds give hair its elasticity, and can be reformed with chemicals. Next, an acid neutralizer lotion was applied, (hydrogen peroxide), to close the disulfide bridges again and the hair was reformed to the shape of the rod. The entire process took 6-8 hours at room temperature.<br>  <br>  Perms today use this method with sodium thioglycolate instead of ammonium thioglycolate, at a pH of 8 to 9.5. This method takes only 15-30 minutes until the neutralizer is applied to bring down the pH and rebond the hair.<br>  <br>  About safety:<br>  Due to the harsh nature of the chemicals, it is important that contact with the skin be minimized. Modern chemicals are less irritating, but measures should still be taken to reduce contact with anything other than hair.<br>  <br>  A poorly performed permanent wave will result in breakage of the disulfide bonds through chemical reduction, because it fails to fix the newly formed bonds. This results in hair that is no longer elastic and flexible, but brittle and fragile. At this point, even combing the hair will result in hair loss. The hair shafts will experience fracture where they exit the scalp. Because the bulb of hair has not been removed though, the hair follicle is not damaged and the hair will regrow; however, the temporary hair loss may be distressing.<br>  <br>  In other words: Find someone who can do a perm well.  Don't get a perm kit to do at home; go to a professional.  A perm works best on hair that has not been colored.  Ask your haircutter if your hair is right for a perm.<br>  <br>  And it's up to you to decide if you want a perm.  Perms last generally 2 to six months.<br>  <br>  Tips:<br>  1. Bring a picture of what you want it to end up like.  This is important, so your stylist knows what you need.<br>  2. Talk to your stylist before you get a perm.  Tell her what you would like different from the picture, and tell her what you DON'T want.<br>  3. Don't deep condition your hair at least 24 hours before you get it permed -- if you do, the perm won't last.<br>  4. If you're Asian American or African American, your hair may be trickier to perm.  Find someone who specializes in perming your type of hair.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your perm!|`|4e8cd40d02dea72a780fb697201d9c7daa	A perm is just that... it's a series of chemicals that makes straight hair curly by tightening the bond of the hair strands. you can get a wavy perm as well, but usually a regular perm depends on your length of hair too. you can't wash y our  hair for 24-48 hours or else it would be a waste of time beacuse it won't hold if you do. find a beautician and go through some styles and decide with her what would look best with your hair t y pe and face.|`|1E5Kpm9Qaa	ya i would get a perm but im not exatly sure how it works sry|`|AA11119837	A permanent wave, commonly called a perm, is the chemical treatment of hair to produce curls. In cosmetology, it is termed a type of curl reformation. Humans have been attempting to add curl to straight hair for thousands of years. The ancient Egyptians did this by wrapping their hair around wooden sticks; slathering it with mud from hot springs; letting it bake dry in the sun and then removing the mud. Presumably the mud had an alkaline chemical makeup that helped to set the curls.<br>  <br>  There are two parts to a perm, the physical action of wrapping the hair, and the chemical phase. Both of these can affect the result. Important physical variables in are what type of rod is used, how the hair is wrapped and how end papers are used. The two most common types of rods are straight and concave; each giving a different curl effect. The wrapping method is either spiral or croquinole, and various types and positionings of end papers can be used with any combination of the above. Generally, smaller rods will produce smaller, tighter curls and increase the appearance of shortening the hair.<br>  <br>  The chemical solution used in the perming process is determined by the client's hair type and the pH of the solution. Classic alkaline perms are used for stronger, coarser hair. They work at room temperature and usually contain ammonium thioglycolate in the pH range of 9-10. Acid perms are used on more delicate or thinner hair. They require outside heat application and usually contain glycerol monothioglycolate in the pH range of 6.5-8.2.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Safety considerations<br>  Due to the harsh nature of the chemicals, it is important that contact with the skin be minimized. Modern chemicals are less irritating, but measures should still be taken to reduce contact with anything other than hair.<br>  <br>  A poorly performed permanent wave will result in breakage of the disulfide bonds through chemical reduction, because it fails to fix the newly formed bonds. This results in hair that is no longer elastic and flexible, but brittle and fragile. At this point, even combing the hair will result in hair loss. The hair shafts will experience fracture where they exit the scalp. Because the bulb of hair has not been removed though, the hair follicle is not damaged and the hair will regrow; however, the temporary hair loss may be distressing.<br>  <br>  A number of brands of home permanent kits are available, but their numbers have decreased as permanent waves are not as popular as they were in the 1980s. The first popular home permanent was the Toni brand. The Toni company used a set of twins to advertise their products — one with a salon perm and one with the home perm. Another brand that was a household name in Britain in the late 1960s and 1970s was Twink.|`|PIg1jz3Uaa	a perm is a permanent solution that is put in ur hair to make it curly! and no, it will not be straight again until tha perm grows out or is taken out.|`|W51ymLw1aa	When you get a perm your hair stays curly for a while (a month or few months).

a193f3c453f33517b03522aadbd95f93aa	Sure it does.  You are used to seeing your face with glasses and don't feel the same without them.  If you aren't 100% sure that you'd like this surgery performed, I'd wait.  It is a fairly new medical procedure, anyway, and meanwhile it can only be advancing and improving so maybe by the time you decide to do this (or maybe not) it'll be less risky for you.  Good luck!|`|AA12095933	you can always get a new pair of glasses just for fashion , but dramatically clearer vision is a much better reason than vanity.|`|ZFZsebCeaa	yes, yes it makes sense perfectly. i think if u decide to go with the surgery take ur glasses off everyonce in awhile so you can begin to slowley get used to yourself without them on. Then eventually wearing glasses will feel weird!
db4a7097c036b1c34576c792e8c76f1eaa	Use a strengthening nail polish. You can even use it as a base coat for your color. Nail polish will also help you not to nibble. If you keep your nails pretty...You won't want to chew on them!<br>  <br>  If you can't hit the shops...Try to work with what you have. You have to have something! Throw all of your clothes on the bed and see what you can put together. And yes, layers are good too.<br>  <br>  A messy bun always works! It can work with a dress..jeans and a t-shirt or a jogging suit. Good luck and have fun with it!|`|12d3071fd6aa5045b79152a77547a297aa	nails are protein so eat it lots of it,anything comfy and casual,half pony tail|`|NQWS4Ptjaa	1. Gelatin.. yes, it's proven that Jell-o can actually help your nails grow (in addition to helping your hair grow, too!)<br>  2. Use the clothes you already have, just layer them up, match them with different items, use belts, etc just for a new look... or go to a thrift shop.  They sell 2nd hand items at great prices, and alot of times even have brand new, name brand items at great prices (or Walmart has cute clothes for cheap too!)<br>  3. Just play it up with barettes, clips, ties, anthing.. try some curls with a curling iron, or when your hair is wet scrunch it together with some hair gel/mousse for a new curly/wavy look|`|de90498d3fbe22e1be89b78931e0380aaa	da mo you clip them da mo they grow, also use special nail growthener I cant get mine to stop growin and I need them short to play da guitar!<br>  <br>  <br>  Ross dress fo less.|`|6ad437315aface63a13be943fc87e3b1aa	go to the store and get some nail stuff that make it grow faster. or go to a nail salon and ask them. they will grow eventually. congrats on stopping!<br>  <br>  boscovs has nice cheap clothing. or just wear what u have now. try putting new things together like different layers.|`|f8b4519132fca3ad3610535a5221ae78aa	Nails...baby them along and take a daily vitamin to make sure you get what you need to help them grow.  The clothing...try your local thrift store, you'd be suprised at what nice clothes you can purchase there for a little bit of nothing.  The hair...pretty barretts or scrunchies, combs placed in your twisted hair, color it adding some highlights.

JYdW4SLYaa	No, I haven't. They look expensive! You should find a great tailor and show them the pic and they can create something very close to it at a fraction of the price.

555b7c70920382a43745fb3f008c2b5eaa	It's the heat.  Any time you apply heat to your hair, you're damaging it.  Your hair is pretty delicate when it comes to heat (fire is one of the few things that can really destroy hair), but strong in a lot of other ways.  <br>  <br>  A straightener (particularly if you straighten all the way out to the ends of your hair) will cause your hair to split at the ends or fray along the middle parts.  If you have to straighten your hair, do it sparingly, just like any heat styling, and be sure not to use a bunch of alcohol-based products while you're doing it.  Drying your hair out (with alcohol) and then frying it (with the straightener) is just hair abuse.|`|947e013054f72be3f4200c9eae8e4c5daa	No|`|aR6KApCbaa	To make sure that you don't hurt your hair it is absolutely necessary that you put a "smoothing" product in your hair first as it creates a "buffer" to the heat.<br>  <br>  Several that my hairdresser has recommended and used on my hair are:<br>  <br>  Redken Satinwear 02<br>  Matrix sleek.look Extreme styling creme<br>  Special Effect Instant Straighten Out<br>  <br>  Any product similar to these will work. Make sure you do not put it on the roots as it will cause the hair to become oily|`|d6b4c4139ce89733ca64c6a954f95ca3aa	Straightners will damage your hair by frying it if you don't use the proper products to protect your hair from the heat of the iron.  Plus it's all about the product when styling hair.  PRODUCTS PRODUCTS PRODUCTS! =)|`|415496b06997c6684e8934b957759d19aa	I think they used to but not anymore. I don't have any problems with them. They don't change the color of your hair.|`|9kaSNSPOaa	I'm not sure about the color part, but my friend says it changes her hair brown when its black, but i don't know if its true or not. Straightners do damage your hair, but if you use it on low heat, its not as damaging. You could get split ends from them, and fraying.

LD0ovIvOaa	All the guys I know love belly rings.  They are such a turn-on.  I love to see girls with tight shirts where a little bump shows she has a belly ring.  Of course, there is nothing like seeing a girl with her belly ring showing.|`|1ghmvlVraa	Belly rings can take 3-4 months to heal and can be irritated by constant rubbing such as clothing. <br>  If you're worried about having difficulty getting the piercing healed then you should consider getting pierced with a navel jewel as they get knocked around less than rings and therefore heal a lot easier. They are more expensive but I think they look nicer, heal quicker and after it's healed you can change them yourself, whearas you need a plier to change rings and this is difficult to do by yourself.<br>  DON'T wear tight clothes such as pantyhose, tight jeans or skirts (during the healing phase) because they can cause the piercing to grow out, which means that the piece of flesh taken by the piercing gradually diminishes until the ring finally comes out; after the piercing is healed you may wear anything you like. Try to avoid synthetic fabrics that don't let the wound breath, try to wear clothes that give the piercing as much fresh air as possible.|`|APPOiW7maa	just make sure that the place u get it done is clean, u don't want to get a disease, no it doesn't hurt. if u r that scared bring ur ipod w/u and listion to music when they are peircing ur belly button. as a distraction.|`|OoCw13taaa	it doesnt hurt as bad as what you think.

The lenght is another factor of the persons looks.  Take your digital camera, take some close ups of his face at different angles, develop them at Walmart or equivilant. Get the larger size ones.  Take a thin piece of plexaglass, or equivilant, a grease pencile, and start shading in the face, and decide on your own.

Also, don't apply liner on your lower lashes, as it will make your eyes look smaller. <br>  <br>  How to Apply Eyeliner<br>  First things first. Never, ever pull the tender eyelid skin taut to apply your eyeliner.  You can gently stretch the skin slightly to apply eyeliner, but don't pull it taut. <br>  Use short, feathery strokes instead of one long line, to apply your eyeliner. It'll look less harsh. <br>  Begin applying your eyeliner from the inside out. You will want to get the line as thin as possible, and as close to the lashes as possible. A slight upward curve at the outside edge of your eye will give your eye an elongated, "cat-eye" look. <br>  You can apply eyeliner before or after your eyeshadow. If you apply it before, your eyeliner will get a muted, smoky look. If you apply it after, your eyeliner will be more bold and visible. The choice is yours.|`|3adfad48b29a4b61d2b02ba3df2625f4aa	Apply the eyeliner in the inner lids both top and bottom and dab white eyeshadow in the inner corner of your eyes|`|a733b867ca2d0ace759674cdd6b98503aa	I would but black on top and bottom also try eye lash extension by mary kay it makes them look bigger and better|`|AA10829047	ummmmm <br>  you should probably have balck eyeliner and make a thin line under your bottom eyelid and on the top of your upper eyelid<br>  that way it makes your eys sort of pop out so people notice them more|`|J14pcmedaa	Dont go over board on eye liner. <br>  <br>  Find a nice colour eye shadow to compliment your eyes (dont go over board just use enough so you can see it)<br>  <br>  now find an eyeliner (black) put it on your lower inside--make it dark but not thick.  Too much eyeliner isnt a good thing, you dont want to look like...well, yeah. If you are having trouble getting your eye liner to apply smoothly...put it in the fridge for about 3 minutes :)<br>  <br>  So..once you apply your eye shadow and eye liner its time for the finishing touches. Mascara!!<br>  <br>  I heard the new mascaras with the comb like ends are good :) Make sure you get as many lashes as possible (in as less strokes..you dont want it to clump-you will end up with spider eyes)<br>  <br>  This should make your eyes stand out but it wont say "hey look at me im a drag queen" :P<br>  <br>  Another helpful tip to avoide blotchy mascara/spider eyes...is never move the mascara brush in and out of the bottle numerous times...all you need to do is pull it out....apply...put in...pull out...apply..this keeps the mascara in the bottle nice and fresh!!<br>  <br>  I hope this helps :)|`|cSMtKnqFaa	thick dark eyeliner and light colored eyeshadow should do the trick|`|f8Kpo3Jlaa	i have the same problem, this is what i do and it works wonders!<br>  <br>  liner on the top that gets wider towards the outside and extends a tiny bit past the eye and wings up a bit. when your eyes are fully open, you shouldn't be able to see the wing.  liner on the outside half of the both, on some white shimmery shadow or liner on the inside corners. <br>  <br>  also, a darker color on the crease, mostly the outside half. <br>  <br>  blend alot!<br>  <br>  then curl your lashes and add a couple coats of mascara|`|uvSdKp8Saa	On the inside bottom put a little bit of white<br>  to make your eyes Pop.Then under that put black or brown <br>  on the top  and bottom.So with the white and <br>  the black your eyes should look bigger.<br>  And if you want them to appear even larger you can use <br>  a comb mascara like (exact lash by maybelline) so your<br>  lashes look bigger too.

Since he was my best friend, I decided to be open with him and I told him that I liked him and it turned out he felt the same way. So, maybe you should tell him how you feel, if he doesn't feel the same way and doesn't talk to you anymore then he wasn't a very good best friend. So I would say go for it. But, make sure you really do like him more than a best friend because becoming a couple will be quite different.|`|947e013054f72be3f4200c9eae8e4c5daa	If he doesn't tell you who he like then maybe it's you.|`|ysYkMoKoaa	he likes you.
c47b77036beece81e6ab5ac8337e1971aa	I've had oily hair ever since I hit puberty. Let me tell you, I've tried almost all of the oily hair shampoos out there... drugstore brands, salon, all-natural... and I have yet to find a product that truly helps.<br>  <br>  I don't really think there's much we can do to get rid of this problem, but I find that any type of clarifying shampoo followed by a light conditioner on the ends only will help. The Pantene clarifying shampoo -- it's a clear blue color -- will give you a deep clean without making your hair feel like straw. I also like the Aussie shampoo and conditioner (it just changed it's name to "double mend") a lot. It treats and greasy scalp AND dry ends.<br>  <br>  Finally, don't run your fingers through your hair too much -- otherwise, it will get even more oily!|`|40068e972242ee8e108abb9ab09d95a1aa	i dont know if this would help, but if you use conditioner, stop using it for a while|`|CLpteyX9aa	Be sure the shampoo you're using is not for "oily" hair. Read the labels at the store. Could be your diet. Some say that does not affect skin and hair but my philosophy is "garbage in -garbage out". We are what we eat ya know!<br>  Try more fruit and veggie diet. Can sqeeze lemon juice on while in the shower. >seriously< it works great.<br>  Also consider a stronger shampoo like ones used in salons or previous responder about Neutrogena.. It's worth the cost.|`|b34ad91ddc626254125d663e05861daaaa	try neutrogena shampoo, it will help tons! <br>  <br>  Also, do you have hard water?

n8A9qfkbaa	Coming from a hair stylist...dont use box, but any hair color is damaging. Your striping ur natural color or depositing another color on top. The chemicals in hair color are harsh PERIOD. Thing with box color from the store, they have mixed base colors, which is why alot of "blond's" that go brunette, turn green, U will need a brown color with a violet base, not a green base. Theres Sallys that anyone can shop at and they carry everything u need for a great price. The workers there know their stuff and can help u. Gotta mix everything urself, such as the developer and hair color, equal parts usually. And its cheap. Otherwise come and see one of us, a professional.<br>  Remember though, Loreal is owned by REDKIN|`|097e844c4aeecfe4f4c0e9f6cf039ea4aa	I heard of a new one called robert craig ( look it up they have a website) that supposedly does no damage to your hair.

The colors come out good, and rarely have I seen anyone with damaged hair from it ( unless you're going to bleach it in which case it will be damaged no matter what)

You can wear a Vera Wang, but if you're slouched over or looking anxious, no dress will show you off.  Stand up straight, rib carriage lifted, and a confident look with a pleasant smile will win.  You'll watch the other girls acting like little children or even tomboys, screaming and acting silly.  Don't allow yourself to act this way.  You will shine.  Tell yourself before you go in...."I am beautiful, I am special,  I am here to have fun and enjoy myself, I am confident..."  And believe it.  It will show exactly that on your face.  Because of the excitement of the evening, don't succumb to getting too excited or overemotional, especially if something negative happens.  Conduct yourself like a mature, intelligent, confident, hot woman.  Have fun and make this a great memory.|`|rLZ2nPxFaa	go buck naked! LOL!

C83sAyo8aa	First look at the price before falling in love with any dress.  Don't go to bridal shops.  It will seem like a good idea and then when you get the pictures you will think to yourself "wow i look soo cheesy."  Try the mall.  Cache [in a lot of malls--Garden State Plaza and Riverside Square (NJ)] is good but it can be expensive.  Macy's is cheaper but a little cheezier.  I usually go to like BCBG which is also expensive.  My advice is to shop around..spend a few days and don't wait till the last minute!!!|`|8x7uNrgtaa	price definitely. find a cute dress that doesn't cost too much. i don't know any dress stores. well, actually, jessica mcclintock if its over there. but try not to spend too much money if you're just going to wear it once and never wear it again. the most, personally, i'd ever spend would be $100 on a dress. not because i don't have the money, but it's pointless to buy a dress if you're only gonna wear it once and that's what i'm going to do|`|ef4cfbb6fa2257d31ea01c6903863602aa	<a href="http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images/view?back=http%3A%2F%2Fimages.search.yahoo.com%2Fsearch%2Fimages%3Fp%3Dsweet%2B16%2Bdresses%26fr%3Dyfp-t-501%26toggle%3D1%26cop%3Dmss%26ei%3DUTF-8&w=100&h=151&imgurl=www.estellesdressydresses.com%2Fimages%2Fgallery%2Fsweet16%2Fthumbs%2Fsweet2.jpg&rurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.estellesdressydresses.com%2Fsweet16.php&size=22.1kB&name=sweet2.jpg&p=sweet+16+dresses&type=jpeg&no=2&tt=101&oid=929f5f6376669ae0&ei=UTF-8">http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/im...</a><br>  <a href="http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images/view?back=http%3A%2F%2Fimages.search.yahoo.com%2Fsearch%2Fimages%3Fp%3Dsweet%2B16%2Bdresses%26fr%3Dyfp-t-501%26toggle%3D1%26cop%3Dmss%26ei%3DUTF-8&w=150&h=230&imgurl=www.quinceanera-boutique.com%2Fdresses%2F2033S.jpg&rurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.quinceanera-boutique.com%2Fquinceanera_dresses.htm&size=6.6kB&name=2033S.jpg&p=sweet+16+dresses&type=jpeg&no=5&tt=101&oid=5fab566955506e36&ei=UTF-8">http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/im...</a><br>  <a href="http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images/view?back=http%3A%2F%2Fimages.search.yahoo.com%2Fsearch%2Fimages%3Fp%3Dsweet%2B16%2Bdresses%2Bgowns%26rs%3D0%26toggle%3D1%26cop%3Dmss%26ei%3DUTF-8%26fr%3Dyfp-t-501%26vf%3D&w=180&h=333&imgurl=www.therosedress.com%2Fdresses%2Fpoly%2FA%2F9024%2F1FF.jpg&rurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.therosedress.com%2Fdresses%2Fdresses-pg13.html&size=9.8kB&name=1FF.jpg&p=sweet+16+dresses+gowns&type=jpeg&no=10&tt=22&oid=9f5fd3369aad25e8&ei=UTF-8">http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/im...</a><br>  <a href="http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/images/view?back=http%3A%2F%2Fimages.search.yahoo.com%2Fsearch%2Fimages%3Fp%3Dsweet%2B16%2Bdresses%26toggle%3D1%26cop%3Dmss%26ei%3DUTF-8%26fr%3Dyfp-t-501%26rs%3Dmore&w=412&h=600&imgurl=www.soniasbridal.com%2Fimages%2F85.jpg&rurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.soniasbridal.com%2F15_7.htm&size=57.8kB&name=85.jpg&p=sweet+16+dresses&type=jpeg&no=10&tt=101&oid=dd1f3c7cf8665a00&ei=UTF-8">http://images.search.yahoo.com/search/im...</a>|`|1MoFmUdbaa	Try any mall|`|3d6738eeb889fb271174f657054d5c42aa	walmart|`|tN5FRtghaa	Yonkers

2T2qQ6QKaa	Hollister is great! <br>  <br>  No. You DON"T have to be superskinny to fit their clothers. They go up to size 11 in jeans. Don't listen to the people who say you have to be microscopic to fit them. Im a small at most other stores, and at Hollister I'm still a small. I'm about 115, and I'm pretty average height.<br>  <br>  If your friend is 130, she is probobly a medium. Go in one day, its a really great store, and its not scary at all!|`|QpWhfr2daa	no hollister has all sizes. u can check out the store and see what u think, but i shop there and find all sizes. some too big, some to small. but its my favorite store and its nothing to be afriad of :) u should check it out ~em|`|d9aa4d613512c7e1f46502be87ba5278aa	My favorite store! And trust me, anyone who says it's expensive is lying. I'm a fourteen year old girl who has to pay for her own clothes, so if it was too expensive.. believe me, I'd know! Anyway, some things are a tad expensive (specifically jackets/hoodies/some jeans) but you should look in the clearance or sale section to see items that are marked down if you're on a tight budget. Anyway, they have all sizes so I would reccomend going into the store to try things on to make sure you get the right fit! Also, if your friend is 130 lbs I reccomend her wearing medium, not small.|`|1e1ce72662ab036bf563f2209078cba4aa	I think what you're actually worrying about is that the people at the stores are all model-looking and super skinny. Some of them are, to be honest with you, but form my experience all people seem to be nice there. You won't feel left out there unless you're very overweight. Then, you might be the center of attention. But I'm not trying ot be mean, I'm just saying what I've learned from going into the store. The sizes at Hollister are exactly right. They're just liek the sizes at JCPenney or any other store. I don't know why people say the sizes are for size 0 models. The sizes are average. I mean in the undershirts or camis, you might have to get a size larger and sometimes even in the t-shirts. But in most henleys and sweaters the size should be just right. They're pants and sweats sizes are ok too. The only thing I don't like is their jeans. They do go up to a large size, but I have to wear 2 sizes bigger in Hollister than at any other store.  I'm a medium or large in the store and I'm taller than most people my age and I weigh about 123 lbs. I'm not the most skinniest girl but i'm definetly not fat. If you like the clothes from what you've seen online, then go to the store. It doesn't carry barbie-doll sizes. Anybody is able to shop there whatever size htey are. I mean if you're like 5 feet and 200 lbs....then maybe not, but you know hwat I mean. Hollister is my fav. store, and I'm definetly not the skinniest girl in the world.|`|AA11542671	oh i love that store, don't worry abotut he size it is kind'a smaller but i am heavery, like 170lbs, and can wear most of there clothes without looking sluty. Also try Abercrombie, it is the same companys, but the sizes tend to run larger,esspacially in pants.|`|Gy2kSIzsaa	get her a XL <br>  <br>  im a small usually but there  im a large and im like under 100 pounds|`|L4WCagQFaa	yes, you have to be model type to fit there clothes!|`|DybU2Sjraa	you say your friend way 130  and they tee shirts  are a small and yours is a XL and yes it is small there!!!|`|Kx8Gejeyaa	its okay.<br>  ive seen girls that are like 200 and wear a large!<br>  soo they're still skinny looking!<br>  well i dont think it is a great of a store.<br>  but preps yeah!|`|pQHmvZOYaa	Unless ur overweight which I highly doubt... its not. I weight 94 and im 12 years old and i can get a medium or small. I bet u could fit their clothes! And that's one of my fav. stores!!!!!!!!! Just try on one of their clothes and you'll c if they fit! Good luck!|`|tqOEWUd0aa	hollister is ugly... everything is soo plain. that's my opinion. but i'm very different from most girls. i have my own style that most girls think are werid. anyways, i don't wear hollister. i ahve some abercrombie clothes but i only wear them in the summer.

I felt like, it would crack whenever I'd smile. Then always the line, I could never get the color to go evenly down onto my neck."<br>  <br>  <br>  “I have not had to renew my topical prescription for rosacea in the past three years that I’ve been using bareMinerals.

This is a professional makeup artists dream!  I know that chanel makes a great one and i'm sure you can pick it up anywhere.  Just look for a green creamy concealer stick (usually comes in the form of a lipstick).  If you can't find this in the drugstore than go to any cosmetic counter and they can direct you.  Just dab a few dots on the center of your cheeks and pat GENTLY and you'll see the red neutralize.  It works great, trust me!|`|xbRKIJyLaa	No, don't cover them up. I think they look so cute! My boyfriend has them and I love them, he looks like a little boy! But if you really want to then you can use concealer, then apply the foundation in your skin tone, then apply powder to keep it on. Good Luck and I hope this helps!!

You can get up in the morning and save yourself the time and trouble of applying makeup to some portions of your face. It's a great choice for athletes as perspiration doesn’t affect tattooed makeup. You'll also note that this type of makeup is not only for the face. Those with scars or discoloration on other areas of their body can also go for permanent makeup. Color displaced during surgery like pigment of the areola, can be tattooed once mastectomy is done.|`|6e6e1f7918da5e943265cd184c8a8158aa	try a mask.. i use a bin liner|`|XHrTJXwlaa	I used to have the same problem I got emo bangs (well that's what they're called here they're actually just bangs that have grown out till they're just under my eyes) and I parted them in the middle then for make up I wear heavy heavy black eyeliner and I brush a little reddish blush(though you may want to use a different color) just under my cheekbones to give my face depth (basically what you do is suck your cheeks and put it right where your face starts to concave)<br>  another thing you could do with your hair is cut it into layers so that the shortest one is about a 1/3 or an inch above where your ears stop. however this hair style is very hard to maintain<br>  hope this helps|`|yj0vVHyOaa	it's not so much the makeup...try a hair style that would shape your face more..i have the same issues and i find wearing my hair up like in an up-do and having swinger bangs (bangs cut from an angle) gives my face more shape...even wearing it down with the bangs makes my face look like i have sharper cheek bones and more angular instead of round...good luck hun.|`|QJhSeX5saa	I have seen shows on makeovers where thin people have had their hair restyled to make their faces look fuller. They parted their hair on the side and got it cut, so I would guess if you did the opposite by parting it in the middle and letting it grow long your face would look thinner.|`|WE4jPMWEaa	well use a little bit of foundation then some cute blush and then straighten ur hair so urface doesnt look so round bye hun!|`|yScL4UA2aa	My advice is under the apples of your cheeks, use a little darker blush near the hairline. Maybe use more natural colors (pinks, tans, purples). A picture would help.

Also a great photo gallery of dreads.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.perfectdreadlocks.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.perfectdreadlocks.com/</a>|`|1O81tvI0aa	i know people have given you a few websites, but honestly dreadheadhq.com is by far the most useful site i've found. <br>  <br>  you need to spend awhile researching it and mentally preparing youself before going through with dreads. that sounds so well-versed, but it's true. i've had my dreads for a bit over a year now, and i've come to realize it really is a personal process and journey. <br>  <br>  but aside from all that, there are a few things you should physically do first. buy some dreadhead soap or some other residue-free shampoo and start washing your hair with that for a few weeks before dreading. also wash your hair a little less often so it adjusts to the change. while it's true that you can and should wash dreads, it's not as often as you would regular hair and you'll wanna wait at least a week before washing them for the very first time. also, if you plan on sectioning your hair (not necessary, but it's a personal choice), do that the night before or morning of backcombing. get a couple friends to help and read up on how to backcomb properly. then set aside an entire day, and start backcombing. it took me over 20 hours to backcomb my hair when i started my dreads, so i'd highly suggest getting a couple people you trust to help out!<br>  <br>  the best advice i have is spend a solid few hours reading stuff online and make sure you're perfectly comfortable with the dreading process... you don't wanna rush into it and then have messy, loose dreads after.<br>  <br>  best of luck!|`|HOvRywZvaa	If i were you I'd go get them done and you have to keep getting them twisted up as your hair grows out.

kdfQmu40aa	These days the word "emo" can mean a lot of things. It can mean a type of music, a way of life, or the way you look or act. A typical teen would say that emos are all depressed, cut themselves, wear tight jeans and eyeliner, have long hair that covers their eyes, and write sad poetry and song lyrics. I think thats just a stereotype but it could be true. Being emo is now "cool" to some kids and teens because they think having problems like depression is cool and actually a good thing. There are some teens who are actually really depressed and cut because they cant help it and there are teens and even little kids who fake being emo to fit it or look cool.  And about the cutting thing, not all emos do it. People who cut usually do it because they have real problems and not because they want to be "emo". People just think that if you cut youre considered emo because emos are suppsoed to be depressed and cut themselves.|`|aEadbqTVaa	when I think of Emo guys i think of them wearing tight girl-like pants.  not kewl ! most of them do not cut themselves.|`|HMR8vYcxaa	from what i heard most fo! but not all..ugh that is scary|`|SyMYGdDiaa	Most of them don't cut themselves.|`|cb578e1acf82406de68dfbb2d61275deaa	well it depends. they are quite and wear black, but u know there are some preppy ppl that cut themselves|`|kEtybtC9aa	they are kinda quiet they dress darker and they have cool hair and whatever and some cut themselves but for some its just their style and kinda goes with the music they listen to which is music with very emotional lyrics and stuff. people give them allotta crap about that but really, is it any different than people who listen to rap and gangsta music who dress...well...gangsta-ish? i don't think so. they are actually nice if you talk to them.|`|51d39e83dd46e0d1c0a27afc32f49934aa	My sis cuts herself but she's consiterd a preppy cheerleader. :l|`|6Pe2dp7Laa	not all of them do..they just dress darker than other ppl really..there rly nice if u take time 2 talk 2 them|`|6fOo94Z5aa	an EMO stands for "emotional rocker" it is someone who finds comfort in the rock music they listen to<br>  no they dont all cut themselves that is just a stereotype like "all blonde's are stupid", it is not true, maybe some do but i dont think that is because they are EMO, they have other problems!! i am not EMO but i have friends who are and it is not true and they dont like that stereotype!!!|`|JOWvlKY4aa	lol emo doesnt have anything to do with cutting yourself really.<br>  its mostly just a trend now emo/scene.<br>  ppl usually dress how they want and have <br>  different haircuts. usually described as scene kids<br>  most girls have a big backcombed hair, some with multiple colors in there hair, and usually skinny jeans and flats. Most of them wear hello kitty stuff, or have pictures with a hello kitty teddy, i find that weird haha =P<br>  And the boys kinda the same thing always straightened hair, in there face. Some wear makeup, and they have skinny jeans also most the time even tighter than girls haha ;)<br>  and usually skate shoes. <br>  Theres not much else to it.<br>  Ppl all just have there different styles<br>  and all have cocky attitudes i noticed.<br>  but yeah emo/scene just all a look really.|`|mf9sQToSaa	The "Emo"  people are teenagers who think poorly of themselves and have sad views on life.  Sometimes they will cut themselves so that they can feel something.  They are really nice people, but they are not-clinically depressed.

AA11143565	Be very careful. You have done many chemical processes already to your hair.  Bleaching it again may cause a lot of breakage.  These processes are best left to the professionals.   Try to find a colorist in town and have the hair professionally treated.  They may  be able to lift out some of the deeper shade without having to bleach it.|`|2db6d9Izaa	go to a hair cuttery and  get it died|`|7nY2OzYKaa	OMG honey.  STOP!  Stop doing the chemical what if game on your own hair.  Go to a Licensed Stylist!  The products you can buy on the retail market are not strong enough or governed closely enough to acheive the results you are trying for but they are too strong to be on the market.  <br>  <br>  I know, that does not make sense but trust me if you don't trust your own personal experience, No good can come from doing this at home!<br>  <br>  The stylist you saw probably did not say "I can't help".  She proably said, "We can't guarantee exactly what you are asking for"  The main reason for that is there is no way to determine "exactly" what you have already done or the current condition of your hair.  <br>  <br>  Go to a different stylist.  Call them first and ask for someone who "specializes in corrective color"  Or at least someone who has a lot of experience in corrective color!  They will not be able to guarantee the results you want but they have the products, the experience, and the knowledge to do a much better job that you can do at home with sub par products and no knowledge. <br>  <br>  DON'T BLEACH IT AGAIN.  Your hair may fall out completely.  You might have to consider getting a shorter hairstyle so the growning out period is not as long. Talk to the stylist that you trust.  Follow their guidelines and accept this as a mistake.  You may not get the ultimate results but you will definitely get better from a licensed professional than what you have already experienced. <br>  <br>  PLEASE, do not do any more chemical experiments at home.  I have corrected thousands of chemical mistakes and it is never pretty for anyone.  <br>  <br>  Good luck.

eKanayouaa	ROOK. I have mine done.<br>  I've had my belly button, my lip, my spetum (twice) my left nostril, and multiple ear piercings.<br>  Needless to say the only ones that stuck around are the bellybutton, one hole in each lobe and my ROOK. <br>  By far my rook is my favorite. I have a tiny barbell in it. It's curved.<br>  <br>  <br>  I must admit, I got it pierced at LEAST 9 or 10 months ago and it still hurts really bad to touch. Esp. when I got it holy crap.<br>  <br>  WORTH IT.|`|xjBFwsVMaa	I just looked up on information on both piercings and found that both take 2-12 months to heal I would say probably closer to the whole year. I also see that infection is more likely in a rook piercing than in a tragus piercing but still is possible. I think I would rather get my tragus pierced than the rook... but that's just me.|`|UUmp7jFbaa	i dont know but they all sound cool...|`|372a2bbf8a8fb343aa612f428f698af4aa	I have both traguses done. I went to a professional and it was clean, so don't worry. The pain is, on a scale of 1 to 10, maybe a 4. Just a pinch. However, the healing is what hurts the most. It gave me a horrid headache for the first week. Then if I bumped them it felt like they were ripped out. My body doesn't generally take piercings very well because after all of that I had two sore bumps form on the backs of both. I had them poked, squeezed, then doused with alcohol. They did heal, and they are very pretty. But if you can help it, get a barbell instead of a ring because barbells look prettier than CBRs. Hope this helps!|`|4BgoJ415aa	I prefer the rook piercing to the tragus. The tragus is just too popular for my taste. <br>  <br>  HOWEVER, if you are still open to new suggestions- <br>  <br>  I have a conch piercing.

If unsure, ask your stylist.<br>      * Hair that is swept off of the floor is not usable.<br>      * Hair that is shaved off and not in a ponytail or braid is not usable.<br>      * We cannot accept dreadlocks. Our manufacturer is not able to use them in our children’s hairpieces. We also cannot accept wigs, falls, hair extensions or synthetic hair.<br>      * Layered hair is acceptable if the longest layer is 10 inches.<br>      * Layered hair may be divided into multiple ponytails.<br>      * Curly hair may be pulled straight to measure the minimum 10 inches.<br>      * 10 inches measured tip to tip is the minimum length needed for a hairpiece.<br>      * Please Note: Shorter hair will be separated from the ponytails and sold to offset the manufacturing costs. Although the shorter hair cannot be used in the hairpieces, it still greatly helps to reduce costs.<br>      * Gray hair will be accepted and sold to offset the manufacturing costs.|`|VLTUNzaPaa	I think you should get the katie holmes bob!

I won't say I regret it because I don't. I wanted to do it; so I did. However, I am trying to grow it out again now. What I found was that I was really used to seeing my hair a certain way, and that I was really low maintenance. So, any style that needed any work other wash and go was not for me. I think you'll find something similar.<br>  <br>  So, the advice I would give you is to stick with something close to what you have but shorter. Maybe take it up to your bra strap for the first cut. Get long long layers, and maybe some bangs. That will be enough to make you look and feel better but not so much that you have to put a lot of time into it. You can always go shorter next time.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

neW2Gcguaa	im sorry you had to deal with that dumb kind of stuff like that, i would try using rubbing alchol to help the healing process maby some 1st aid cream, other than that just time will help. <br>  good luck for both of you|`|E76or3sYaa	..I am sorry -- I dunno..<br>  x|`|Zjb4p1TRaa	I don't know what you can do to avoid it, but the only thing that'll let it heal is time.

CMJQ1Q2Eaa	Look at yourself in the mirror everyday and tell yourself I am beautiful and say one great thing about yourself. It sounds REALLY STUPID, but it really does help.You can try out new styles by switching up your wardrobe. Don't wear jeans and t-shirts all the time, try skirts and nice shirts. I'm being really hypocritical, cause I wear jeans all the time. Haha. Also, wear makeup to accentuate your natural beauty. Don't load on the concealer and 10 pounds of mascara and eye shadow. Wear cute perfumes and stuff like that. Hope I helped!|`|8yQYmxVOaa	Surround yourself with ugly people|`|69bTpDqVaa	Make yourself the number 1 proirty.

LRtygRojaa	Here's how I think about it - I'm 5'9 too: <br>  <br>  If you were shorter, a little bit of extra weight would make you look fat. When you're tall, people hardly ever notice extra weight.<br>  <br>  You can wear pretty much anything and still look good.<br>  <br>  Would you rather be 5 foot tall or a midget?<br>  <br>  Modeling.<br>  <br>  (:|`|B3fpwDasaa	I am 5' 5'' and I am 14 and my mom is 5 foot.  I am the tallest female in my family.  It makes me feel like a giraffe.  Oh well, I still am not tall enough to be a model.  You could seriously model!!  You are gorgeous.|`|nuFYOoguaa	ima girl and i'm 5 9 and it kinda sucks<br>  but it gets better once u get older u start to appreciate it<br>  and its cool czuz ur not like every other 5'2 girl<br>  and u can always model;)|`|X6uWdSEHaa	i think being tall is cool.<br>  models are tall.<br>  guys like models.<br>  am i right?<br>  <br>  im 5'8" and 13.....|`|3NdKGDlHaa	I am a 5'11 guy, so yeah you might be too tall for me. Although your name is pretty gay|`|0kJjU6nYaa	5'9 is great. as long as you have the legs to go with it. AND YOU DO!|`|c8feee70b4d544d0673cd362806f0633aa	6 feet<br>  <br>  i wish i was your height. my boyfriend is 6'3" and im 5'7" and he thinks im short..|`|ta9t1qqxaa	ENJOY IT!!<br>  cause some of us wish we were you|`|AA11452842	I'm 6'5" so anything up to that is good with me..............|`|eBHqRaAZaa	Nothing is too tall<br>  You are what you are.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|AA11746317	I'm 5'8" and 15. I like it cause I'm taller than my older sister. and people notice you. but it sucks cause I can't wear high heels at dances and stuff cause I'm as tall/taller than the guys. lol|`|EmZytbxyaa	im 5'9 and 14, i like it, everyone around me is short, i like being different|`|gxo0Ln2Baa	6 feet is too tall for a girl i wish i was taller im only 5'4 its sad. :( :)|`|JGS287Eeaa	WHY DO YOU HATE IT!!!!<br>  im 5'10" and only 14<br>  i love it<br>  all my friends envy me!<br>  embrace it!
rlvrgwWvaa	Well here is a really good acne treatment I use. First I wash my face with a benzoyle peroxide wash, like Oxy. Then I use benzoyle peroxide cleaning pads, Oxy is also good for these. I have a prescription cream called differin that works very well, so I would get that if you want to. However a cream like Stride should also work well.|`|TsmqhvZHaa	try cocoa butter
u2VQYCKQaa	yea very over priced...<br>  <br>  "i can by the same damn thing on walmart shelf half price and still look sexy"<br>  <br>  <br>  haha =]|`|YfK76B6xaa	yup, especially their bras! They are not that great for the price!<br>  <br>  EDIT: If you all try a dept. store bra like the brand Wonderbra, trust me you will notice the difference in quality compared to VS!! I used to feel the same way about their bras, until I tried the dept. store one!!! Way better quality and lasts way longer! I'm a 34D too!!!<br>  <br>  EDIT: Bob!! Class has nothing to do with anything, that is soo ignorant of you!!! I'm upper class and just bc I have money does not mean I will pay more money for quality that I don't think is that great; especially if I can get a better quality for less!!! It's common sense!!!!!!!|`|wa8fPcfEaa	I loved VS until I worked there.  They have this customer service policy that if the person appears to have money, only pay attention to them.  I am no longer willing to pay $40 for a bra.|`|l0P1OsdYaa	It could depending what the Item is....I would say If you believe its too overpriced go to the annual year sale Its usually after Xmas around Jan. and its GREAT!!!!! They always seem to have everything on sale plus most things on sale are Worth it!!!!!!!!!!!|`|PFm1dI55aa	Very|`|q5S0q1CQaa	Not really, because their bras are worth it.|`|btNUf7rcaa	yea they are, but sometimes i dont mind paying|`|hwWghZY8aa	dont know..i cant get my eyes off the models|`|dVraPVrVaa	I do with that I could get my bras for $20 like some small breast women but I can't so I really don't mind paying Vicky because (1) I wear a 34D and that is a hard size to find at say wal-mart or some where and (2) I know that it's good quality and my bras will lasts.|`|RRJblUvHaa	I think certain things are okay - if you like their particular fragrances, for example, they aren't more expensive than most other perfumes.<br>  <br>  But for a lot of items, I agree they are overpriced. There are plenty of places online, if you know your size, that have better deals.<br>  <br>  If you aren't sure of a fit, however, it is going to depend how many other lingerie boutiques there are near you...sometimes convenience trumps price!|`|lvalgliyaa	They are. Sometimes they have good sales though, especially on PINK panties. If you want to pay a fair price for VS stuff go to the actual outlet not just the store, theres a difference. Like most of the malls by me just have the store...except for great lakes crossing which has the outlet where you can find lingerie for like 6 dollars.|`|0wkSf58waa	I think they are overpriced on all of their products. I always wait until their semi-annual sale to buy bras so I feel a little less guilty. I do like their bras very much and pretty much stick to those to wear, however I'd have to be hard pressed to pay full price for one.|`|7gFK2Zx9aa	I think that you get what you pay for.  Shopping their sales or discount on bulk is a great way to go.  Their products last!|`|BEvzXXVfaa	Over priced. |`|9PY430cgaa	Well, it depends on what people your talking about. I'm upper middle class, so, no. I think their prices are good.|`|aZ7FbOiqaa	I love the Very Sexy Bra's....I haven't found a better bra for me any where else. |`|th2dvrbQaa	definitely, but i still pay it because the media gets the best of me :(|`|YBjcPUWiaa	Not if you shop there during the semi-annual sale!! LOL|`|xaD36dvYaa	Heck yeah!|`|xxDjV6Axaa	Yes, they probably are but they're convenient and I love their gift wrapping.  Plus they have some really cute things at Christmas.  But as far as underclothes go, I find that other stores have better quality and better fit.|`|cd3db14d1e54f8f56d160141b3b7357baa	Yes, but isn't that the secret?|`|AA10697029	Not only are they overpriced...but for the prices you would think that they would have in their inventory bras in cup sizes larger that DD.<br>  There are some 34 & 36 DDD wearers out there.<br>  I understand their products are really comfortable and long lasting (I can't say from personal experience, since they don't sell my size).<br>  If they had DDD sizes then the price would be ok for That size, but to pay ALL of that "cheddar" for an A cup?  I don't think so!|`|KC3ciXdWaa	I think they're overpriced but I still buy their products because they're such good quality, I tried buying elsewhere and was sorely disappointed  : ( |`|RuPxMfmjaa	I these economics are determined by the little head.|`|gYRfWcleaa	Over priced and I never find bras that I like from there! 
2lKk9s5Naa	I have the same roblem, which nobody seems to ever understand. Im  a grown woman now, and im finally able to gain a few pounds ! You can try weight gainer shakes, you buy the powder at GNC ! Also you need to eat 2 pb n j sandwiches before bed. Also i still drink alot of chocolate minlk to ensure that i dont get too skinny. I drink a gallon of whole milk throughout the day, with hersheys chocolate syrup. Those extra calories and fat will help you get your weight up!|`|m5NV1GBUaa	No, don't eat those girls are just jelous. It's healthy.|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	eat a lot of steak with the fat still on it|`|NIHXUmN1aa	Go into a health food store and ask them to show you sports supplements made for gaining weight (I used to take them a lot when I played football and needed to keep my weight up)...they are called mass adders, powdered drinks...also start a light weight lifting regiment, that will add a little muscle and also make you hungrier so you will eat more...good luck.|`|f9f5eb7a2590ee5242a18dc42abeef7baa	no need for nutrition bars.  look for multivitamins with vit. B.  and lift weights - that will increase your appetite.|`|Q6usQV1zaa	THEN TAKE FROM ME.............|`|OSD5by7Oaa	yes|`|dmWnQ1MSaa	Well give it sometime<br>  your weight will kick in.

They're probably just jealous. Those health food bars aren't that healthy for your age.|`|bW2fVh9baa	Hey, try going to like gmc or vitamin world and get some protein shakes, they make you gain weight like crazy, they have stuff just to gain weight|`|pWs40Ohlaa	Eat lots of protein and get good excercise. This help u gain good weight, but not fat.|`|OhtFnfX8aa	if you eat alot then there is no way fro you to gain weight.|`|MHQkgpdqaa	eat more, but exercise to .|`|M5yDMjlLaa	gaining weight is easy!  just put me on top of you.  that's an extra 150lbs on you, babe ;)
t0WFfhRfaa	yes. hehe im a sucker for a guy that smells really good.|`|vJRMmgd6aa	yes|`|tuULGJS6aa	Just being clean is enough to suit me. Men who wear too much cologne seem like gays. I've been around some men whose scent nearly knocked me down. No perfume is better than bathing in it.|`|HIwJFtNlaa	To me, scent means a lot. I love a guy that smells good, it's the first thing I notice, next to their body of course. This may sound like a shallow statement, but it's true. I love a guy that smells good, whether it be axe or the most expensive cologne. I think it also depends on a girl's prefrence on which type of cologne, one type may turn a girl on but turn another girl completely around. But all in all, the majority of girls that I know love a guy that smell good. <br>  Don't put on too much though!|`|SHoGWZWPaa	cologne is always good, just not overkill. polo makes some good ones. the one in a blue bottle and the one in a purple bottle. they aren't cheap, but if you're going to wear cheap cologne, don't bother.|`|kUhcypC9aa	Yes it really does help alot :) x|`|QevBVANtaa	yess. A good smelling man is a turn on =]|`|oAmw8zkuaa	Heck yeah man! Ladies love a guy with good personal hygiene. Taking a shower, cutting your hair, brushing your teeth, putting on cologne; this is all contributing to your personal hygiene! <br>  This also sends a subconscious message to ladies as well as everyone, it says who you are.<br>  If exude that you take good care of yourself, and look presentable, smell good then people will take that as a reflection of your life.|`|M5yDMjlLaa	of course it does bro!  ive had girls walking in front of me literally turn around to look at me, from smelling the cologne.|`|rd5468H1aa	Of course they are, just the same way that guys are attracted to girl's that smell good...|`|PPLxDKYwaa	It's certainly a plus! My Fiance always smells nice and mix it w his own natural body scent - I can't resist!|`|4REeX6lbaa	guys that smell good do make me more attracted..|`|dd9559c1e59d3b44217363867d81b42baa	Mmm..cologne smells great..<br>  but guys have a natural smell<br>  that is amazing too..|`|bcd2f8a4de30c0766a3301b22926e0f8aa	i like men that smell like sweat|`|149681fb3263f24eef4f63c1ee76d63caa	Nooooooooo, it makes A HUGE difference,<br>  <br>  <br>  trust me ;]

Whatever inches it measures out to like 34 inches or 36 then that's what size you buy.

But its acceptable now a days although those look like they are made to be wrinkly looking, and you should never wear wrinkled clothes in public. Plus, they can be rolled down so all you skin would hang out, and thats just rude. |`|wx6PimtMaa	No, they are not tacky, and I think you should wear them. If your a little uncomfortable of where to wear them, just wear them around the house, in gym class, etc. Mainly where you'll appreciate their softness and stretchiness.|`|4f3a737236a41a6d97a4242f26f42bc6aa	if your are just going to school and you want to be comfortable, then its no problem. you should see me. one day i cute look cute in a pair of heels and the next day in jogging pants and a pullover. just depends how you feel that day!|`|AA11746317	no it's not. I have some like that (black ones) and I wear them all the time. If you feel tacky in them, pair them with a nicer shirt and some jewelry.|`|WPt9bivgaa	Good if you want to be comfortable in public but expect to be treated as a teen.

iLJtoOL4aa	BUN! PUFFED! USE HAIR SPRAYY! MOOSE! <br>  <br>  hope i helped<3 :D|`|XLRx5decaa	Sucks that you don't have curly hair because if you did, all you'd have to do is brush it.<br>  <br>  I guess you could blow dry it upside with LOTS of hairspray. Seriously, like a whole bottle of hairspray.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Edit: Teasing helps too!|`|fpyLWbVxaa	Teasing. A LOT of teasing.|`|llamLKgLaa	Okay so this is like a major flash back for me, lol.  I am a hairstylist and the best thing that I can tell you is to curl it with a curling iron and then tease the s*** out of it.  Once you've teased it, then go back in with a pick and move anything around that isn't where you want it.  The best kind of hairspray for this look is any aerosol that is labeled either Freezing or Extra Hold.  If you don't know what teasing is, you pick up a section of hair.  Hold it straight up towards the ceiling and then down towards the scalp comb it down (the opposite way of how you are holding it.)|`|BBq3xqnHaa	you tease it .<br>  take a comb and a small portion of hair and comb it the opposite way going inward really fast , and then ittll make like a little knot thing but your suppose to do it under the hair so it poofs up , lots of people at my school do it to make their hair 'volumized' but just search tesing hair on google if you still dont get it ,,,|`|qZzNkbsBaa	What my friend did was curled as much of her hair as she could, hairsprayed it a ton, and then teased it. And i couldn't find any neon belts...|`|AA11746317	blow dry your hair upside down, and then hairspray it. <br>  and you could try Claire's for the belt.|`|e0af5c7879c2041bf2239a139395ddbeaa	Hot rollers, a rat-tail comb and a big can of Aqua Net super hold.  Section your hair off and roll the bangs and top backward and the sides and back upward with the hot rollers.  Leave in until cool, then remove, turn your head upside down and shake the curls out. Lightly spray. Flip your hair, let spray dry and then start teasing. Spray with the AN to hold.  You may want to use a mousse as well.  Warning, your hair will be stiff and you may need more than one shampoo to get all the goo out.<br>  <br>  The technique is rather difficult to explain and hard to master, so ask your mother or an aunt for pointers. Also, 80s cuts had more layers than your hair does so you won't be able to get an exact replica of an 80s 'do but it will do for what you are wanting. <br>  <br>  As for the neon belt, check Hot Topic they usually have stuff like that. |`|7tZOFsHqaa	LOTS OF TEASING AND HAIRSPRAY! haha

iLuc1xyAaa	I think its nice that you like this girls style. I wouldn't worry about copying her because millions of people do this everyday by following celebrities and stylish women. Im a victim of this myself, and the vintage look is in this season. I bet this girl has an idol that she is following. Make sure you are comfortable in your skin. The many mistakes some people can make is dressing there body wrong because they saw some stylish wearing the same thing. The best thing you can do is figure out your body shape, try <a href="http://quiz.ivillage.com/diet/tests/celebdouble.htm" rel="nofollow">http://quiz.ivillage.com/diet/tests/cele...</a> to find out your body shape and start dressing for your body type. It may be different than this girls. You can still wear vintage, look stylish but you have dressed for yourself and not what this girl has worn.<br>  It could be that instead of you wearing skirts like she does, you can wear high waisted trousers and a cute blouse. Your bag doesn't need to be a school bag, it can be a cute vintage clutch bag. Vintage has a lot of style. Go crazy with it.<br>  Keep your head up high and be proud.<br>  x|`|TdGbIDH8aa	Just go for a different style maybe the scene look :)|`|bDjI55FXaa	Whats your other favourite trend?

This way you can wear all the nautical, preppy vintage too and it will just become a part of the wonderful vintage stuff you always wear. I cant recommend always wearing vintage enough!! even if you just try to find the vintage versions of what she wears theyll be unique because theyll be no way that she'll have the same thing...vintage all the way :)<br>  you should have a look at some of the cute 50s dresses on ebay at the moment, the ones that sit at the knee... they are going to be big...get there first. one day youll notice that shes copying you :)
eAhkr1ruaa	I think that true beauty, is being able to admit it when you're wrong. Knowing that you're not perfect, no one is, and you shouldn't judge people. I think that true beauty is having the power to be yourself, and follow your heart no matter what everyone else has to say.<br>  <br>  I definitely think that inner beauty is more important.<br>  ?.blondy|`|DS21ekeJaa	True beauty is when the real, inner you shines through and no one is looking at the skin and structure of you, but at the energy of you.|`|evMd2CuIaa	Both

mwEIf2URaa	I like going to Delia's myself. They have a bunch of cute clothes with a lot of different patterns. I also go to Rue 21 and Forever 21.

They always give me some ideas of what to wear. I'm not telling you to copy them, but you can see what looks good and maybe incorporate that into your style.  Look in Fashion magazines, they would give you tons of ideas, Cut out all the clothes'styles that you like.I don't know what you like so it's hard for me to tell you what to wear. If you look in a fashion magazine, you would also see fashion designers, find your favorite and buy clothes that you can afford, but with similar style to those that you like. <br>  <br>  If you need clothes for cheap, I think Forever 21 and Charlotte Russe are good places. But you can always find a local thrift store that sells vintage stuffs. A lot of interesting clothes are vintage.|`|Y6Bkhgokaa	A cute pair of jeans and then shirts from forever 21 or nordstrom.

Eb0bHX4jaa	What's a Blister?<br>  A blister is an area of raised skin with a watery liquid inside. Blisters form on hands and feet from rubbing and pressure, but they form a lot more quickly than calluses. <br>  <br>  Blisters usually just need time to heal on their own. Keep a blister clean and dry and cover it with a bandage until it goes away. While it heals, try to avoid putting pressure on the area or rubbing it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_9064_treat-blisters.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_9064_treat-blist...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  What's a Callus?<br>  A callus is an area of thick skin. Calluses form at points where there is a lot of repeated rubbing for a long period of time — such as the hours spent raking leaves. The skin hardens from the pressure over time and eventually thickens, forming a hard tough grayish or yellowish surface that may feel bumpy.<br>  <br>  Calluses on the feet, however, can be painful because you have to step on them all the time. They usually form on the ball of the foot. (The ball is the roundish part on the bottom of your foot, just behind your big toe.) Some calluses also form on the outside of the big or little toe or the heel. Tight shoes and high heels often cause calluses because they put a lot of pressure on your feet at points that aren't used to all of that stress.<br>  <br>  You can help a callus go away faster by soaking it in warm, soapy water for 10 minutes, then rubbing it with a pumice stone. The stone has a rough surface and can be used to rub off the dead skin. <br>  <br>  <br>  What's a Corn?<br>  Like calluses, corns are also areas of hard, thick skin. They're usually made up of a soft yellow ring of skin around a hard, gray center. They often form on the tops of the toes or in between toes. Like calluses, corns come from pressure or repeated rubbing of the toes. Corns usually develop after wearing shoes that are tight around the toe area.<br>  <br>  Corns take a little bit longer to go away. To help them heal, you can buy special doughnut-shaped pads that let the corn fit right into the hole in the middle to relieve pain and pressure. There are also pads that contain salicylic acid, which takes off the dead skin to help get rid of the corn. If the corn sticks around for a while and keeps hurting, you may need to see a podiatrist <br>  <br>  |`|Elxuvon8aa	after they heal up rub your feet with oils get them to toughen up so you do not get blisters again  rub them hard |`|gS0wCTLPaa	i think its called a callous...i think..|`|c3316a5f71249d75a984bd40fa3e4358aa	Go to your pharmacy and get some cream to heel the blisters. When blistered are heeled get some foam cushion pads for feet and put these where you got the blisters this time. Maybe the shoes don't fit. If you get an infection or are worried more about it see your doctor before it gets serious.

Getting eyebrows cleaned up will also open up the eye area and brighten your face, again make sure new eyebrow shape compliments you face shape. And please go to a pro, I've seen many people who let a friend try to do their eyebrows.  I've had to explain to too many people I can't put hair back.I can only even out each side.

The only way you can straighten your hair is with a flat iron. You can try straightening shampoo, but that only helps. Just use a heat protector before you flat iron.

Im guy 2. do you want a camera with a bunch of pics of you in your old clothes. or would you rather your friends email you the pics they took of you looking like a million bucks. the clothes def. + if you shop wisely you can get a lot of clothes for $150 maybe not a lot but more than one camera. for the extra money look around your room and whatever you grew out of, ie toys etc sell it on ebay. if you get $5.00 for something you paid $50 for but you don't use anymore then thats another 5 spot to go on another top or pair of shorts.|`|bDxSXwvTaa	GET THE CAMERA, WAiT F0R THE SAlES F0R THE Cl0THES. i l0VE TAKiNG PiCTUERS T00, S0 YAH...i CAN MAKE ANYTHiNG l00K REAllY CUTE 0N ME!

17Dq1XLqaa	While the process shouldn't hurt, please consider some of the consequences. Feminine deodorant suppositories (douches) can actually make you smell worse. Douching can introduce new bacteria which can cause irritations and even cause infections to other areas such as your cervix, uterus and fallopian tubes. <br>  <br>  In addition, those who do this pose a great risk to Pelvic Inflammatory Disease. If you have any further questions I would suggest you contact your doctor and they can explain in further detail.|`|AA11438887	Don't use those things. It is not necessary. Wombs are self- cleaning and unless you have an infection, which should be attended to by a doctor; nothing is needed. Normally you are always clean, so daily bathing and showering are enough.<br>  <br>  They can also cause irritation.|`|o3rI7ngoaa	all you need to do is follow the manufactoring instruction. you cant go wrong. please bear in mind that the vagina produces chemical tha cleans itself and if this is altered it can result in irritation or a yeast infection,so doctors advise ladies against it. if u wish to use it do so in moderation|`|xXzToteXaa	ive used this product. maybe 3 times and i havent had a problem. and it does not hurt. you should use it like 15 minutes or more before you take a shower. if you dont feel comfortable than dont use it.

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|MVsQ2xjIaa	I don't think you were really on 0-200 calories a day because that would mean like 3 apples a day and that's impossible or else your parents really don't care about what you're doing with your health OR you don't know what 200 calories are.<br>  Diet has never been about not eating, on the contrary. If you don't eat, your body thinks it is in starvation mode and starts stocking fat (just like animals for hibernation kinda). As soon as you start eating just a mouthful more, you will gain back the weight you lost which in fact isn't even real weight loss since all you did was burn off all your muscles.<br>  Just eat one fist size of veggies, of meat and bread/pasta/whatever and go work out. You will feel better.|`|AA11706756	im kinda in the same boat i lost 67lbs i got down 2 110lbs then i ate dinner at my families and i got home and was 116lbs its tricky cuz i usually only eat once a day and have 2 slim fasts|`|hyqHkwnFaa	you can stay on a specail k diet

AA11925968	Lol sorry but I have to say its Chloe with an 'h'...don't hate me :/<br>  But ahh you are so lucky to be getting one I love chloe, its my favorite designer & their paddington bags are so cute! A really good website to tell real from fakes is ebay, they have really helpful tips/instructions<br>  Also a chloe paddington bag is around $800+ so if your mom buys one that is far less, you shoule be suspicious that it is fake. Chloe bags are also pretty heavy mostly because of the material used, so be sure to check the quality of the bag.<br>  If your mom buys the bag at the actual Chloe boutique or a certified seller like at Neiman Marcus then its real.<br>  Xoxo

You can add dyes or scents to it too|`|Lsy6sNPCaa	just put together leftover pieces of soap , and there u go!

You have a couple of choices.  You can buy red paint and carefully re-paint them.  it will still rub off, but may keep them looking nicer longer.  The second idea is to buy Red Vibram soles.  They are sold on e-bay and cobblers can also buy them.  It is a Red rubber material that a cobbler applies just to the ball of the foot area that touches the ground.  They will not rub to a different color.  Personally I just wear mine and if they ever get too bad I'm going to re-paint.  I wear my CL's every day and everywhere so they can get pretty beat up on the bottom.  They still look good though!|`|NIlDPtNeaa	Go to a nearby shoe replace place, or look in a phone book to see if you can find any in there.

AJvjD3gmaa	A 36A and a 32B are virtually the same thing.  Your best bet is to go to a Victoria's Secret store and ask for a bra fitting.  I had always bought bras that were too small for me until I got fit properly.  If you are a 36, you shouldn't go down to a 32...perhaps try a 34B.  And, please don't listen to the other poster about pills or creams...your doctor will  practically laugh at you, tell you there is no such thing to help with your bust size, it is predetermined through genetics.  You don't want to sound ignorant or naive.|`|VUtHZEMkaa	you might grow more cus your young if you can ask your doctor if theres pills while your young to increase your size cus it sucks having small boobs when your my age. im 21|`|7GxMRQ5Daa	idts(i dont think so)|`|AA11746317	www.zafu.com<br>  <br>  |`|4TMEHji0aa	try on new bras and see what fits. i'd say you're a B cup, but idk.<br>  <br>  try on 32,34,36. those numbers are just the elastic part!<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck! <3

There's certain things that guys have to hold back on. Let give you an example, wearing small girl backpacks down your schools hallway doesn't really make you much more of a 'man' than they say they are. It in fact, it bothers me, but IDK if you say pink shirts that's ok but don't go over the limit and wear something that may make people judge you as being something else. If you catch my drift.

MVsQ2xjIaa	As long as you buy a well known brand and leave it no longer than the time stated in the leaflet you will have no problem with it. Use conditionner more often though and try to ease on the hair dryer/straightener when you have dyed hair. But other than that, your hair will grow out back in your natural color yeah.<br>  <br>  I been dying my hair for almost 8 years now and I have no problem at all. You just need to know how to take care of it|`|GQbF0Twiaa	Any dye can harm your hair but especially if it bleaches your hair because you strip your natural color|`|48SlX2Yiaa	Your hair is never the same after you dye it. <br>  <br>  Perhaps if it does not come in contact with your roots, but I got my hair dyed twice. Once just streaks, second full head. I have my black hair back. Most of my hair is soft, but there are parts that are always somewhat dry.|`|m2WGmGXjaa	Yes it will. Depending on what kind of temp. dye you use, will determine how long it takes to come out though. :P
oXpTspmhaa	I am a red hair full out and no matter how hard i try i can't tan either. so wear bright colors. <br>  such as a light blue (which looks really good on redheads)<br>  yellow (as long as it's not OMG yellow)<br>  and no matter what anyone says NOT Red and Green. <br>  Not on redheads. but since you say your hair is more brown maybe it'll work for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck =]|`|6Ss31wyBaa	red|`|DZB0WCmmaa	oooh, you're probably still a kid, that's why you're teased. The others just don't like theyr dark akne skin. Not black, black would make you look even paler. Then... not dark colours. I see red already suggested, having in mind the colour of hair and eyes, it would be good yes. May be light blue also?|`|rVbY5qBsaa	Blue, red, purple, yellow, just try to stay away from neon colors. I actually think really pale skin is gorgeous because it always looks so flawless and draws attention to the features the person as (probably your eyes). Don't listen to the haters.|`|qLvhoRpsaa	Wow, you sound a lot like my oldest daughter. She is 17, a ginger (don't call her that, she will hit you!) and if the sun even suspects she is outside, she is burned!<br>  <br>  She looks fabulous in various shades of green (pastels & kelly green especially) and a strong red (you wouldn't think so) and yellows are stunning too. <br>  <br>  You sound pretty!<br>  <br>  Peace:)<br>  <br>  P.S.

Try lighter colors, like pastels. Nothing too bright, but go for neutrals. This doesnt mean you will look boring, it means it will make your skin appear darker in contrast.

Well I'm not entirely sure that I have a good picture of you BUT. These are definitely some colors to stay away from. Yellow ( will make you look sallow/ sickly ) Pink ( unless you find just the right shade it will clash with the color of your hair quite badly) Colors to go for: Blue, green, black and white together!( dont do solid!!!), Any kind of print would probably look lovely. Also If you want to look tan I have found that Jergens gradual tan work wonderfully. I was going to provide a link to where it was sold at walmart ...however they arent showing it online sorry :/|`|EvcT7eyBaa	purple|`|AA11706756	if u cant tan u should try spray tanning and i would say lite colors|`|dEmPi9Hfaa	Colors that would look great on you:<br>  Pale baby blue<br>  Sea foam green<br>  Turquoise<br>  Pale yellow<br>  Try out some neons with black variations.<br>  <br>  <br>  Colors to avoid:<br>  Red, including brick red<br>  Peach<br>  Tan<br>  Bright Yellow<br>  Neon pink|`|bQCfOftxaa	i'm the same way..personally i like to wear bright blue shirts, deep red, brown/or anything "earthy-toned".  i pretty much wear anything - but try to stay away from too much black and pale pinks/yellows (they can just wash you out)|`|OGAh1LF9aa	I personally have really pale skin, and red and black are both really good colors to compliment your skin tone. Also, stay away from white, which will tend to make you look washed-out.|`|MHQkgpdqaa	dye your hair a blondish ,<br>  <br>   & you can get skin darkening creams !<br>  <br>  use light brown, creamy colors on your eyes <br>  and no black eyeliner.<br>   brown !|`|Jhpiy5lFaa	if u think your skin is beautiful than you shouldnt care what anyone else says.

YUMqQZBzaa	This sounds like what happened with a friend of mine who had an allergic reaction to one of the inks used - the rest of her tattoo was fine, but her body freaked out over one of the colors and pushed it all out, it burned, and swelled very badly. Maybe for the touch up ask him to try another brand or color?|`|7WYzL1exaa	I am having the same problem with my wrist tattoo. Though my ink isn't running, just fading. I would suggest giving the tattoo studio a call and seeing what they can do. If you decide to get it touched up like i plan on doing, keep putting the lotion on for another week or so and then make an appointment with the artist that gave you the tat! Good Luck!|`|0A41iPd3aa	It almost sounds like your having an allergic reaction?  I would go see your doctor or maybe even go back to the shop where you got it and ask them if they have ever seen this happen before...<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|dwGKnbVhaa	maybe is not dried it|`|3648e98700b8351146e2b5699bd638ecaa	OMG! dirty needles. go get it checked.! now!|`|HEb7MzCMaa	its probably infected go to the place where u got it and ask whats going on they will tell you|`|bTnhTR8uaa	Sounds like you may have too much moisturizer on it.  That can make the ink run...  and can cause some fugly scabbing. <br>  <br>   I notice a lot of people getting tattooed and then over-applying ointment and lotion - too frequently or just too much of it. Keeping it too moist, to the point that it's nearly turning any repairing tissue to mush. Then, while they sleep the mush hardens, turning to a scab. Morning comes and on goes more goo... that then absorbs into the scab turning it to mush again... and later, dries out to form a thicker scab.  <br>  <br>  The wrist also bends a lot and that bending can cause a tattoo to heal rather funky.  Without a picture, it's kind of difficult to tell what's going on.

FGCHhP5iaa	My hair is the exact same!....I wouldnt get it thinned though because when you get it thinned it just gets thinker and you have to go back all the time to get it done again. What I do is sometimes i braid it while its still wet and its not as frizzy, and other times i straighten it, altough it takes a really long time, but its worth it but becareful because it gives me alot of split ends.|`|k6Ip2kfGaa	Why don't you try out some products especially for softening and taming your hair. I like John Frieda's line (even though they're quite expensive) Try some hair-masks that'll give you shine and relax your hair and maybe try out some serums. (I have one from John Frieda which.. I don't really notice any difference.)<br>  Don't flat-Iron your hair too much! It'll damage and in the end frizz it only more! If you do it, try to use a protective spray on it. <br>  You could always stop by your hairdresser and ask him/her what to do. He'll probably know the answer.<br>  <br>  You could also look around online as to what to do. There are tons of good sites out there that'll help you understand your hair and then give you suggestions on how to treat it.|`|WDLnNm7Maa	try going out to a professional haridresser and buying a straighning product that will keep the frizzies and whatever down..try wearing it curly.

y0GHXozVaa	Did you just recently get it pierced? My hurts when I take it out and put it back in too, but it only after I've had it out for a while. If you're not used to taking it out and putting it back in, it will hurt. But neosporin is a good idea! And you can try to wiggle it around when you're trying to put it back in. And it sounds gross, but I put my finger in my nose facing upwards and feel for the jewellery to come through as I'm putting it in, otherwise you're sort of just blindly trying to get it through the hole. <br>  <br>  This is starting to sound a little sexual, so I'll shut up now. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps. :)|`|c3316a5f71249d75a984bd40fa3e4358aa	See your doctor.

zdQGden1aa	It depends on how well you'd like the dress to compliment your figure. You said that you're curvy (aren't we all?), so if you want a dress to make you look slender dark colors are a must. If you want to be bold then light colors are a dead given, but the style of the dress would be most important. I went with a champagne color for my prom dress with cream lining trimmed in rhinestones. The shoes would really set the dress off! Have you decided on shoes yet?

Good Luck : )|`|UAunAKdtaa	for right now try olive oil, just put it on your scalp. it moisturizes well, and conditions your horribly mistreated hair. then,after about 10 minutes, hop in the shower, wash it off well, and rush over to your beauty salon and get it fixed. your stylist will give you a product to help with your scalp and she or he will fix your color mistake.<br>  good luck!|`|qlepHpX0aa	you can't correct it your self  first because you would be double processing it and only a hairdresser can do that with out ruining your hair ( double processing can be harmful if done wrong.  It can result in loosing some of your hair or ALOT of breakage ) secondly depending on what you used and what it looks like you are going to have to put the right color on top of it or else you can make it look even worse.  ( You can distort the color even more )  I would just make an appointment with a hairdresser.   <br>  <br>  As far as your scalp burning.  Hang your head in the tub and run cool water on your head until the burning has cooled.  Then wash your hair ( dont worry about how your not supposed to do that for 24-48 hrs you would be getting it fixed anyway) and let air dry.  This will wash any of the dye residue away.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|O5nCKpwcaa	Go to the hair dressers and get it fixed proper. I've been in this situation before and this was what I was told to do!

With your hair, you should do the blond/black thing (Blond on top Black underneath), and fringe it at the top. You should also add black extentions on the bottom, and straighten them. It looks really good.<br>  <br>  Just to let you know before you get scene hair, it takes ALOT of work to style it right. It takes me about an hour to style/straighten/fringe it, plus every month or so I get a re-colour.

You obviously will not be able to dye it in basic, although once you're on a base or in your training school, you'll be able to get it styled.  The only way they style it in basic is by getting it cut, which is usually a very shotty job at best.  You're hair is probably going to be looking not so good regardless, but anything you can do to make it look as normal as possible would probably be a good idea.|`|jhNUuz0maa	The AFI 36-2903 states the hair will not contain excessive amount of<br>  grooming aids, touch eyebrows.

aeZZu1HOaa	Nothing but a hormonal change will make your hair color alter.<br>  <br>  However if you do something (like shaving it or dyeing it) you will be more sensitive to its appearance and so it may seem like the color changes.  That's just human nature, try not to worry about it too much.|`|ceebbd5b347bf3b3c44701e742d76f97aa	No. It will always grow in the color determined by your genes. Thats why women have to keep dying their hair, if it stayed dark they would only ever need to buy one box in a lifetime.
ukIX88cAaa	Anything with jeans automatically makes it casual, so don't worry. I'd say just don't wear a bunch of fancy jewelry b/c the heels seem dressy enough.|`|Y8tcUuWjaa	No!!!! Not at all if any you may even want to add some jewelry to your outfit. But then again it kinda depends on how fancy the top is. So to tone it down a little bit wear a sweat shirt thats fitted and cute! maybe gray or white.|`|Whnxbz5Kaa	I think its not to dressy the skinny jeans work it girl but I  do think you could use another top and the high heels work it hope I helped bye.|`|h4neRNGbaa	That sounds good but if the heels are high && might hurt your feet, bring along a pair of flats.

oKSYNez3aa	Yes, they do all the above!  You can get some good clothes there, but, its definately one of those places that you have to try everything on!  Hardly anything there is true to size!  You can find some really cute stuff, that will last, but, like I said, you need to pick thru it for sure!  |`|5a1PpwrWaa	forever 21 close are great. I always shop there.<br>   recommened you going there asap. that always have cute<br>  bags for 10 dollars.and cheap shirts and ncie jewelery.<br>  whatever you do dont go to wet seal. wet seal clothes are the cheap fade and shrink ones.  I learned that from my own experience ! good luck though :) <br>  ohh and if you like forever 21 youll like hertiage they are provided by the same companies. |`|yEABBdWiaa	yeah there pretty good<br>  better than primark<br>  they are very good quality for the price.<br>  but not as good as designer labels obviously.<br>  |`|9iphkDSTaa	Yes, they're great! I got a pair of skinny jeans from them last fall, and people still say, "I like your new skinnies."<br>  <br>  I also have a few shirts, and they're like new too!|`|vhK7lfkdaa	They're pretty good quality clothes. I love buying clothes from there because they're cheap and styles change so quickly that I don't end up paying that much to get a new wardrobe after some time and if I stop wearing something after awhile I don't feel guilty. I don't find it necessary to pay too much for tops because styles are always changing.<br>  <br>  The only things I do pay really good money for are jeans because I'm difficult to size since I'm petite. But their jeans, coats, tops, skirts, etc. are all great stuff. Sometimes some of it isnt but for the most part their clothes are well made, just make sure you try things on because no matter your size sometimes you will be getting a s,m, or l depending on the material or whatever sizing they decided to use, which can be annoying.<br>  <br>  <br>  I agree with Erin that Wet Seal stuff is the one that shrink, fade, and stretch. I haven't had a that problem with forever 21 and 1/2 of my clothes are from there. <br>  <br>  But yes their stuff is great even their accessories!

Cities have different age limits and rules on some piercings. If you're under 18 you usually need a parent with you, but I think you have to be at least 15 anyways. So no, I don't think there's any places that don't check ID. If you can't find anywhere though, don't let her do it herself because that would be really dangerous.|`|uxM4H10saa	a 13 year old with a toungue piercing that she had to lie to get is probably one of the trashiest things ive heard of. <br>  On top of this, theres no way she would be able to pass for an 18 year old in a shop (which, they check for ID anyways, even if you do look 18)<br>  and if she gets it doen by a friend, or just anyone thats not actually a professional, it will probably get infected.
bjfJy7zJaa	They are not Marshmallows baby!|`|DsQwrkYYaa	they wont melt because they are human hair extensions so theyre just like your hair. they probably wont get lighter, but your hair may get lighter.|`|cZ2dq8jKaa	i have human hair extensions, and no, unlike the synthetic, they don't melt, i've used them in tanning, straightened them, etc, they're exactly like your natural hair. as for geting lighter ... i'd say no, but it's not something i've ever really thought about or come across ... but they'll curl with your hair if it's humid ahahh<br>  <br>  don't take them underwater in florida, they become a tangled mess and get destroyed

How about knee boots, black opaque tights, leather jacket and either jean skirt or black skit with a silver or gold toned belt. You could also instead of wearing a leather jacket wear a corset top. Don't be afraid to accessorize either if it's a rocker theme. Long necklaces and necklaces of different lengths/styles would work well. I hope this somewhat helps you.

3X7hF6ssaa	Wow, you're really pretty. very european- looking.<br>  And yes, I think Demi's look would look great on you.  Though the bangs are so long that you'd have to keep them trimmed every few weeks, but I think you'd look great with side- swept bangs.|`|xmXH9RyAaa	this haircut would look adorable on you. it would really bring out your eyes. also it would shape around your face and really bring out your face. but the only downside is that it looks better on brunettes, but you will still look good in it regardless.|`|xY8yRwPGaa	First off- you're adorable. Secondly, yes I think it would be flattering, but you would have to grow your hair longer to get it that way. But if you're just looking for the basic bangs and layers, then yes, I think It'd look good :)|`|Cifvipzhaa	I think it would look good on you.<br>  <br>  But you do have to remember that you would have to straighten your hair every day.

Make sure it is still hot, and take a butter knife and scrape it off of the iron to get most of it off, then when it cools down wipe it down with a cloth and whichever cleaning agent you choose. <br>  <br>  As for the hair situation, that could be tricky. I would have to say wash the hair as regular, and if it doesn't come out, cut it.|`|0wkSf58waa	Hmmm this could get tricky, first make sure the iron is cool and I would use a warm washcloth and Dawn or some other mild dishwashing liquid to clean the iron. As for your daughter's hair try shampooing it out and if that doesn't work you may have to trim the area where the plastic got stuck. Best of luck!|`|LZwpxSiBaa	u will have to wipe the iron wen hot again...it will get clean ..and as far as her hair..try simply washing it wit hot water and lemon ...!! if it dsnt help thn wsh it with an egg ..!! if it still dsnt go ...u can iron hr hair again and hope da plastic can be wiped off with a tissue wen its hot in her hair..!!<br>  <br>  bst of luck...!! try cheering ur daughtr up..it can be really traumatic..!!|`|roAXNzicaa	not quite sure about her hair but it shouldnt be too complicating but my straightener melted my contacts case and got it all over it so i just waited till it cooled down and scraped the plastic off and its fine =)|`|WvTbPOVyaa	unplug the iron. Wait until both cool down, and wash/pull out <br>  the plastic.

Sexy doesn't always mean show lots of skin, especially when you have kids that age...They're reaching the age when other kids will tease them because you look, well, like a tramp for lack of a better word.<br>  <br>  Also, I've known lots of women who dress the way you say you do and it's great when men admire them, but as soon as one makes a comment they don't like, all of a sudden it's not so much fun anymore.<br>  <br>  Super low rise jeans, if you can find them because they went out of style over a year ago, (women got sick of having to pull them up every time they rose from a seat...and that ain't sexy at all!) were made for women in their late teens and 20's...not a woman rapidly approaching middle age...I don't care how good she looks.<br>  <br>  Look at the fashion magazines...NO ONE is wearing them anymore but mall babes.<br>  <br>  Seeing a woman wearing clothes that are too young for her is simply sad.|`|8kElQJCeaa	Sorry but that is just off-putting<br>  where's the dignity women?<br>  think it looks good walking around showing ur butt-crack :O wats wrong with you.?<br>  <br>  My advice is pull your trousers up and cover your a**|`|ttsttvIBaa	Are you being serious?<br>  That's really nasty.<br>  What type of douche wants to show there BUTTCRACK!??|`|PjrvZG9Jaa	That is not attractive at all!|`|tdQ45dKNaa	How about none?|`|f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	wow obsessed with your as$ much??|`|sngn4U78aa	butt clevich is a big no no!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|qP3tlhpGaa	wow. what a demented mother.|`|azbnTFW4aa	I don't think but cracks are attractive. a good crack to show is cleavage, but not but, i don't know why but i find it skanky.<br>  you also can get rude comments about it like "you could park a bike in that" ive heard someone say. i wouldn't want people saying that to me walking down the street.|`|edzuI05aaa	Its your choice to wear what you want BUT don't we have a choice if we want to see peoples butt-cracks? I'm attractive with a good figure and honestly, leaving more to the imagination is way more sexy!|`|0wkSf58waa	Honestly, I don't think any butt crack showing on anyone is attractive. It's fine to show some stomach or cleavage but I think pants that cover all of you and flatter your curves are a better bet.|`|37s0dGtoaa	I think you should show none.

AA10926522	Call your colorist at home.<br>  <br>  If you can't reach him/her, you can do the following without causing permanent damage.<br>  <br>  Ash Blonde to Ash Brown (depending on how dark your color is now) temporary mousse (the kind the old ladies use, it's a mousse you can find at any Walmart or drugstore and comes in a zillion colors.<br>  <br>  using ash toned will neutralize the red if that's what you want.  If you just want to match your highlights to the rest of your hair, find a mousse that closely matches your reddish brown hair but don't go to dark or it'll look fake.<br>  <br>  Apply the mousse CAREFULLY to only the highlighted strands you want to blend in.  If you put too much of the ASH tone on the blonder strands you run the risk of a greenish hue.  <br>  <br>  Wash it out completely at your first opportunity.  Do not use a store bought permanent color and do not use a "temporary" demi-color.  Demi color over highlighted strands will not wash out completely and your colorist will have to strip those strands and start over.  (which is horrible for your hair)<br>  <br>  There is no time limit to tone your hair.  Use the mousse to get you through your day, wash it out when you can and get back to your salon as soon as possible.|`|AA11179849	Oh goodness - I had the same issue. There should be toning products at any convient store. Mine got toned down after 2 days prior to get the highlights done so I wo'nt really matter how long you wait. Just be careful when you go out to get the over-the-counter product - don't get a shade of red.|`|AA11532022	i agree that you should not DIY.

y67OLTiLaa	First of all red streaks will not stay visible for more than a month. It will look good but just remeber getting a more natural color last longer. You can ask someone who is very good at photoshop to add some streaks to  a picture of you and you can see how it looks. I think... Loreal or some brand like that has a website where you upload your picture and you can see how different colors look, maybe try selecting sections of your hair instead of the entire thing and maybe you can see how streaks will look.<br>  And like the first answer, search google for "Red Streaks".|`|AA11045471	if you dyed your hair black then you're pretty much screwed...<br>  <br>  please go to a salon to do it-- dont do anything yourself or it'll look like ****.|`|b033u1Btaa	Search google.|`|wCTq9p2Uaa	Go to hair streaks pictures. After that, I clicked on "image results for hair streaks pictures". On images, choose small images. Then go trough the ones that you like. You should get a picture of how it looks like.

MthIvBZ3aa	I can relate to your situation in so many ways!<br>  Consider doing an hot oil treatment before you wash your hair.  Use virgin coconut oil (unprocessed).  When you buy it in this form it won't have an oil look, but will look like a jar of lard or something of that form.  Take about two tablespoons and warm on the stove.  When it has the oily look pour it over your hair and massage into your hair and scalp.  Cover with a shower cap and leave on for about 1 hour.  Rinse and then begin your normal wash and condition!<br>  If you aren't going to do the hot oil treatment, take a dap of oil and mix it with your shampoo when you are washing your hair.<br>  Also, massage your scalp at least 15 minutes a day.  This is known to stimulate the scalp!<br>  Make sure when you are detangling your hair that you comb from the outside in.   Meaning don't comb from the roots, but start at the ends and work your way towards the scalp.  This has less breakage on the hair and detangles better. Only comb when your hair is wet, don't brush!<br>  HOPE THIS HELPS!|`|MtC3CWZraa	Honey, I’m not trying to be mean, but I can’t read that.  You have a bunch of non words and no punctuation.|`|nXX9LIjnaa	Okay I'm Indian and I know exactly what ur talking about. IDK if you have and Indian store nearby but if you do buy some Amla oil (its green and looks gross but ask a store clerk if you cant find it)<br>  I know it sounds really weird but it works. On a day where your  not gonna be in any human contact, put the oil all over your hair and just sit with it all day (or even a couple hours). Wash it  out and your hair will smell, look, and feel gorgeous. It works wonders!!! then you can blow dry and flat iron  and the hair will actually be straighter than normal. Doing the oil once every 3 days will really improve the condition of each individual hair causing it to grow.

0yeSW0qnaa	Well, she has a professional stylist probably, so it would be very hard to get hair close to hers.

You can usually find it at most large chain shoe stores. Just ask if they have anything to widen shoes.

whQ282QTaa	NEVER use alcohol or peroxide. it will dry your piercing out and make it so much more worse. I wouldn't recomend using any soap either. It will wash away all the good bacteria and everything your body needs to heal it. use sea salt and hot water as hot as you can stand it. 1/4 of sea salt to 8 oz of water. use a q-tip to clean the front and back of it. and then get a cotton ball an soak it in the water and put it on ur piercing and hold firmly for about 5-10 min. Do this for about 2 or 3 weeks. and wash your mouth out with listerine half diluted with water after you eat/drink/smoke. |`|tBF9VfPqaa	<a href="http://www.bmezine.com/news/edit/A60524/artprope.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.bmezine.com/news/edit/A60524/...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|9NKoHyy8aa	Hydrogen Peroxide<br>  <br>  I see I gave the wrong answer.

Natural Lavender soap is great.<br>  Also, soaking your lip in either Lavender tea (as hot as you can stand) or salt water will help with the infection.   I used to make a very hot cup of tea (or salt water--1c water with 1tsp salt) and sit over a coffee table with my whole lip in the water.  Do this for 10 minutes, 2X/day, after washing it thoroughly.  Remember to rinse!|`|9FyWgRxFaa	Definitely do not use peroxide or alcohol that will dry it out and make it worse. I to have my lip pierced and I used sea salt and warm water on a clean wash cloth to heal mine. Just clean the area and keep it on your lip for a few minutes and if you want to clean the inside you can gargle 8oz of warm water and a pinch of sea salt for a few minutes. Thats how my piercer told me to clean it and it worked|`|zRZKdH1Zaa	NEVER use alcohol and peroxide.  It will dry up your piercings and that's not good.<br>  <br>  Betadine works very well.  Just use a q-tip and put it on the outside and inside of the piercing.  Let it sit for a bit then clean it off with water.<br>  <br>  Listeriene is always good to swoosh with too.<br>  <br>  Clean it 2 or 3 times a day.|`|azswXRDBaa	I'd go with sea salt and water a few times a day.

Some might disagree suggesting it was too "unusual" or too much like a costume, but I think unusual and even a costume can be a style in and of itself if you have the confidence and appearance to pull it off.  <br>  <br>  A Victorian wedding would be interesting though I wouldn't suggest wearing Victorian garb to someone else's wedding, only your own.|`|5jsMY4RIaa	I agree that Victorian fasion is sexy.

Most agencies require that you live  within 1-2 hours of the agency office, so you are available to attend go-sees at just a few hours notice.<br>  <br>  Why don't you want to be with an international agency, like Elite, IMG, Next, Marilyn? These are the big agencies who get the biggest clients and the most jobs. Just because the agency has offices around the world, chances are you will only ever be booked on jobs through the office closest to your home. It would be very rare as a new face that you would be sent to Paris or Brazil on a job unless you had an absolutely unique look.|`|ydHU7gYIaa	that doesnt sound safe or legitimate; an international agency wouldnt send scouts out to the us for girls, as far as i know. real agencies are bombarded with submissions and going out to get more would be kind of stupid. and agencies arent really "national"- i mean they have branches in major cities, but if you dont live in the city the agency is located in, you cant work there, which is just common sense. the fact that you were scouted makes me uneasy though. top agencies dont normally need to recruit models; they have thousands sending in photos as it is, so this sounds like it may be a scam. are you at least 5'9 with a strong face, and are you a size 2 or 4 with great proportions? these are requirements of legit agencies (although plus size models are signed also; theyre size 8-12, but the competition is a lot stiffer for them) as for finding different agencies, you need to google legitimate modeling agencies in YOUR hometown (although small towns generally do not have agencies) or a city that is very close to where you live now; an agent in new york wont sign a girl who lives in orlando, for example. it just doesnt work that way|`|Nk6NS5Lxaa	Have a look at <a href="http://www.thefashionfix.com/2009/02/new-york-model-agents.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.thefashionfix.com/2009/02/new...</a> <br>  I don't know where you are, but these agents have branches all over the place. <br>  Good luck.

7FGsxx4Qaa	Low lights should give you the effect you're after....................|`|Q4oPyclQaa	Find a punk/goth shop and buy a vibrant red semi-permanent hair colour, my favourite is called Special Effects.  It's conditioner based so it won't hurt your hair.  Don't bleach it.<br>  <br>  Wear lated gloves (like the kind you find in hair dye boxes) and put a dime-sized spot of red hair dye in a plastic bowl that you don't care about staining.  Add some cream conditioner until it's going to be enough dye to get through all your hair, you think, and mix it well.<br>  <br>  Use a tint brush and brush it onto your  hair.  You wanna use old clothes and a towel and wipe it off of any surface that it drips onto IMMEDIATELY.  These dyes are permanent on surfaces.<br>  <br>  Once it's all through your hair, let it sit for as long as you like (it won't damage your hair since it's conditioner based and doesn't use any blecahing. You can even do it overnight and your hair will feel fine) but for at least half an hour.<br>  <br>  Wash it out, style as usual, and take a look.  Does it look red enough?  This should give you a very mild red tint.  If you wanted more red, do it again with more red.<br>  <br>  Good luck. :)|`|IHw2qUtcaa	Dye it "red black", when the sun catches it, it shines red.|`|zX4dQUo0aa	i've just done this :)<br>  <br>  i used the "red-black" colour by Schwarzkopf Live Hair XXL or something like that, it turned out really good because it works on dark hair. it's in like, a blue box if that helps haha.|`|AdIrjmV7aa	Mix about 1/4th auburn hair dye with black hair dye and then dye your hair.

4onF5FSTaa	Hi, How Are You?<br>  Jogging, as stated above, will not help, because you are a size 8-10, which is usually petite.  I'm a similar size to you, I'm 6-8-10 (it depends on the shop) and i'm telling you that you neither need to jog, nor stop eating (or chop the fat from your throat.. XD).  (No-one needs to jog anyway, theres nothing wrong with having a full figure at all). <br>  As for your chin - it happens to almost everyone, it's totally, completely natural.  I've just looked in the mirror and it seems that when you laugh, if you stick your neck out a tiny, tiny bit more, the double chin disappears. Not too far though, or you'll look like an ostrich XD.  That just seems like a more flattering pose, but seriously, I really, really wouldn't worry about it at all -<br>  everyone is beautiful as they are, in their own unique, special way. Be yourself.  I'm sure it doesn't make you ugly or anything, and i can guarantee that you look at it MUCH more than anyone else does! ^_^<br>  <br>  Hope I Helped!<br>  Love, Sakura x|`|TdGbIDH8aa	I think that's a natural thing hun sorry.|`|EV1Z1AWCaa	I asked this a few weeks ago.

Some even come in Terrcloth, a well known beach-friendly fabric :P<br>  <br>  Anyway, I hope I helped you out a bit. Have loads of fun at your party and Happy b-day when it comes :D|`|98GNQuvSaa	well if your going to be out in the sun, and the center of attention then you should definitly wear a white dress. for shoes you should go with some pink or other colorful solid color, if they are new where them around the house to brake them in, you wouldnt want to get blisters from walking around at your birthday party.|`|5uVe3CPsaa	you can buy really nice swimwear from<br>  <br>  www.riverisland.com<br>  <br>  just click on the womans section and go down to the 'swimwear/lingerie/loungewear<br>  <br>  (: hope this helps, x|`|qc1fasaeaa	oh girl all you need is a really cute beach dress and a cute pair of flip flops|`|509248920483afa8396e2237322a94beaa	on a beach, you wear a one piece bathing suit, then put on a skirt and a light jacket.  when you need to swim, you can just take the skirt off.
4DYZ3JZBaa	Yes :D<br>  first of all "nice pic" lol<br>  i love the color you picked<br>  it would go perfect with your skin tone<br>  and im not sure..but in the pic it looks like your eyes are kinda hazel<br>  if they are, the color will make them stand out more :)<br>  and the color will go perfect with the hair cut you have now.<br>  I really think it would look very nice..<br>  but of coarse its all on you<br>  if YOU like that color then go ahead<br>  it doesn't mater what other people say or think<br>  if YOU like it then of course you'll look pretty :)|`|O5Z6M9Rlaa	Yes! your hair style is perfect for this.

Very good choice. :)|`|350cc6173ffb629f134cb3e382d77470aa	yes <br>  do it if you want it|`|Dd9Lc3tDaa	It will look amazing!!!|`|AA10764528	yes|`|SLx2hW5waa	truthfully, you are actually very pretty but your hair is making you look dull sorry, i think you need the fringe thined abit and into a swept fringe so it doesnt look too harsh, and i think the colour would look better/ gorgeous medium brown- this way you will look more summery and pretty<br>  xx|`|eJMIazhLaa	I think it would look awesome!!!

7CF1WKjMaa	I'm fair too, but in the summer time i get very tan, i use the Australian Gold tanning oil. It has SPF in it too, and buy sunscreen for your face, because usually the face on a fair skin peron doest get tan it just burns.<br>  <br>  so also buy bronzer for the face
BDOBSPQnaa	I've use a Panteen protection spray for breakage & heat. It's kind of like a leave in conditioner, except not that heavy on your hair..<br>  Anyways, I've used it for the past few months, and my hair doesn't have any breakage.

kCdISEGqaa	Please do not take offense to this, but, why would you want a tribal tattoo like that one?  Are you Samoan, Maori, or a member of any other nationality that wears such tribal artwork?  If not, it's just a fad, and a lot of artists hate doing tribal tattoos.  They are boring to do and are so overdone.  Besides, a true tribal tattoo has meaning behind it, not just for decoration.  They may signify membership to a certain family, a specific tribe, or the accomplishments or hardships the person has faced.  Sorry to be so negative.|`|acYPFNeFaa	its not there!|`|53e1c3e3cf69dd882ecfbbb50e404730aa	Polynesian tribal is probably what you would ask for,as i don't think we need to specify which islands work it is based on.<br>  did you notice there are chinese letters or kanji which probably belong to an earlier work running down the middle|`|RnFpjFODaa	ew tribal tattoos|`|VsLSJ65Paa	Tribal is WAY OUT OF STYLE. Go with something more modern~~|`|6zblh7Tiaa	I'll guess Samoan, cause you didn't post a pic.|`|rjac15O0aa	The photo is not there.
WO68RZdIaa	As long as their legs reach from their hips to their feet, I'm happy.<br>  <br>  Long or short, I have no preference.

lU8e0VQFaa	Yes, they can be removed, but generally they need to be cut out, which more likely than not will lead to some scarring (and the piercing itself will most likely keep you from getting employment in most areas). If you don't think it'll be something you want there forever then I would suggest not getting it, you don't want a round scar right in the middle of your forehead for the rest of your life.|`|zlXofrG4aa	Yeah but I wouldn't do it yourself.  I hope that's a given though.  Your piercer would have to do it.  There might be a scar though unless you obsessively take care of it.|`|m0Hd7Kj3aa	Removal is possible, but the method used is heavily dependent on how the implant has been treated and how long it has been in for: as a result, removal should only be attempted by a fully-trained body modification specialist. Scarring varies greatly, again depending on what removal method was used and the condition of the surrounding skin
ESAMvi4taa	Check <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons</a><br>  <br>  They have a registry there of salons across the country that have stylists trained to cut and color curly hair.
GxOsvnxmaa	get one printed especially for them at a printing shop.
rp372bcYaa	Depends on the place you are serving food.<br>  <br>  <br>  Buy fish wire, cut a small peice and put it in your peircing. No1 will ever know|`|xxSGhywoaa	Um no!  That's just gross.  I don't even like going to the grocer and being rung out by a kid that has piercings all over their face.|`|az0Z0DIjaa	YUCK!|`|fRhN5nAeaa	If you work in a restaurant or something along those line's then i don't think you'd be able to just because of health and safety. I guess it really depends on who you work for and what the rules are if health and safety havent like said no, no you cant have that, you might have an employer that doesnt mind but you might have one thats not willing to let you have it. :(<br>  I couldnt agree more with people having piercings or whatever, i liek peoples will to be different form the rest or just having it generally ^_^ I'm always saying i like this or that to people, i hope you get the answer you want ^_^ x|`|5cJrnaQaaa	Depends who your employer is. If they hire you..they can't make you take it out.

My friends do. Tongue and eyelid.|`|R7ACldBKaa	I doubt any manager of a food place would want their worker to be displayed like that (unless its a theme restaurant of course)<br>  <br>  it may be a personal health hazard, b/c you never know (that's what the owners always say)<br>  <br>  i know i wouldnt want my waitress or waiter serving me with a lipring...no offense, but that belongs out of the workplace|`|C62F31Dwaa	Well I know some bartenders are allowed to. I'm not sure if a waitress or waiter can though.|`|jI2j3wd8aa	I don't c Y not! U can ware anything u want as long as u are clean and u wash your hands.
x5NzYL8Taa	Cross it like an X or use hairspray when you put it in :)|`|czAbrzcUaa	You just need better quality ones. Tbh with this, the more expensive they are, the better they're likely to be, but don't get ripped off!|`|3CSoSRmtaa	I recommend bobby pins with a plastic coating.  They have more friction and stay in longer.  I recommend also using hair spray on the bobby pin itself then inserting into your hair before it dries.|`|8iR6XOD7aa	cross them like an X. its holds so good. <br>  or you can hair spray them once they are in your hair.|`|zjPhjKY7aa	hairspray the bobby pin area. works for me :)|`|59Sszxz8aa	use a different type of clip if they dont do it for you|`|ohmcwW6Baa	depending on the hair style.  If your doing a rockabilly freedom roll.  Or something with curls, then you should take the ends of your hair in between your finger and thumb  roll hair up to the scalp make sure to hold and roll tightly. place finger in the loop of the center of the roll. place the first bobby pin on the left side of the roll weave the smallest piece of hair in the center of the roll into the hair that is the closest to  the scalp the right side do the same thing with the bobby pin.. So maybe the tricky part of making them stay in place is to secure them by weaving the pin into your hair. you can watch tutorials on you tube and those ladies have a lot of great advise.|`|4v0Ies06aa	you can try putting more hair into the bobby pins although that might not work so you could buy some Scunci No-Slip Grip Bobby Pins from like walmart or walgreens.|`|YUcl70rbaa	crossing them like an X works but if not, Goody's makes slip resistant ones but if you can afford a few extra bucks, go to Sally's and get the professional ones (they are stronger metal and closed better).|`|eJMIazhLaa	I would buy a different brand then because I've never had a problem with them staying in my hair.
