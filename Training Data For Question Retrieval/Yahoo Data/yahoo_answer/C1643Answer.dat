Ive come across so many people who have moved here and hate it. For some reason, there are a lot of british people who are racist, especially towards other european people - they think they are taking the good jobs and are so ignorant they say they are ALL polish! I am british but personally I dont have a problem with anyone else coming to the UK as long as they are economically active, but its a shame that so many immigrants want to come to UK for a better life and end up being treated with less respect.|`|0ViseCjwaa	Your Engleesh is better than most of our existing teachers so no problemo.<br>  Me thik good idea as Engleesh teacher, but no other jobs available.|`|AA10410043	don't you know there's a recession in england too. people are losing their jobs by the hundreds every week, it makes me sick to the back teeth why foreigners want to come and take our jobs when we are struggling personally ourselves. they come here and sponge of the state. who willy nilly give them free handouts.

mcq0H3Mmaa	Hola!! no sé bien desde donde está embarcando tu mamá, pero supongo que está volando con Iberia, ya que hablas de la conexión en Barajas. Generalmente, y digo generalmente porque no conozco el 100% de los aeropuertos del mundo, pero conozco muchísimos, al área de embarque solamente accede personal autorizado, por un tema de seguridad. Podrías comunicarte con el servicio de información de Barajas a ver si ellos tienen un servicio de ese tipo, pero de todas formas te cuento que el servicio de las líneas aéreas es para todo tipo de personas que necesiten asistencia, yo lo solicité muchas veces para pasajeros inexperientes, y los acompa?aron. Inclusive lo solicité cuando la conexión era en aeropuertos por ej en Alemania y los pasajeros no hablaban el idioma y tenían miedo de no entender, y los esperó personal que hablaba espa?ol. Tienes que pedirle a tu agencia de viajes que solicite a la línea aérea el servicio de MAAS (meet and assist). Ese servicio lo tienen todas las líneas aéreas. Otro servicio de acompa?ante que tienen las cias es cuando viaja un menor desacompa?ado de menos de 5 a?os, que debe ir con una comisaria al lado, pero ahí le tienes que pagar el pasaje. No creo que haga falta llegar a este extremo en el caso de tu mamá. Simplemente lo que necesita es que la acompa?e alguien a hacer el chek-in de ida, que le expliquen bien, que le muestren las dos tarjetas de embarque para los dos vuelos (el Madrid Bologna ya se lo deben entregar junto), y que le aseguren que el servicio de MAAS está confirmado en Barajas. <br>  Hoy es feriado en Buenos Aires y no puedo llamar a Iberia, pero ma?ana llamo y si hay alguna otra opción de acompa?antes del aeropuerto mismo te lo agrego.<br>  Pero créeme que un buen agente de viajes le tiene que solucionar ese inconveniente, y asegurarse que llegue sin problemas a destino, es su trabajo!! <br>  Espero haberte ayudado, saludos.<br>  Cris|`|09b9a1dbecc6545c0d7908a63ed72c04aa	Seguramente existen pero te cuento mi experiencia: mi suegra está perfectamente de salud y ha viajado sola, con solo pedir este servicio en la aerolínea no ha tenido ningún inconveniente con su escala en Barajas.

c315470fb88e9ea62ffb520f574abd0eaa	Hola, pues como buen gunajuatense te recomendaré que hagas en el centro un recorrido a pie que incluya (puedes caminar en el orden que te digo):<br>  Alhóndiga de Granaditas, mercado Hidalgo, Callejón del beso, Universidad de Guanajuato, cerca de la U hay una iglesia antigua q no recuerdo el nombre, Jardín de la Unión que es un lugar bonito con restaurantes con terraza donde puedes comer rico a un precio moderado, frente al jardín de la unión está el teatro Juárez, del teatro Juárez caminas un poco y subes al funicular que te lleva al Pípila que es otro de los puntos a visitar ya que desde ahí contemplarás una vista panorámica de Guanajuato muy bonita que sale en la mayoría de las postales. De ahí puedes bajar por el funicular y tomar un taxi o camión o tu carro y desplazarte al museo de las momias , ve temprano porque cierran como a las 5.<br>  En otro recorrido, partiendo del centro puedes ir rumbo al castillo de Santa Cecilia te paras ahí y lo recorres, sigues después por el mismo camino y llegas al templo de la Valenciana (también lo cierran temprano, como a las 6) es un templo bonito con 3 altares chapados en oro y unas pinturas muy interesantes, y a un costado del templo de la valenciana, está algo escondido pero pregunta pro la bocamina de San Ramón, es una entrada a una mina a la q bajas con guía y con un grupo de personas q ahí esperan a q se junten, adentro hay salones con ilustraciones de todo el sistema de minas de Guanajuato, vale la pena.<br>  En la noche puedes ir otra vez al Jardín de la unión ya q es punto de encuentro de turistas, grupos de música, y se pone bien para cenar o tomar un café. Si quieres ir a un antro los mejores son el Grill o el capitolio, los dos quedan relativamente cerca del jardín de la Unión.<br>  Hay otros puntos como la casa de las 7 leyendas, la presa de la olla.|`|219bc811da8695ecb80179e4b64b4dc1aa	pues primero que nada las momias, el callejon del beso, la universidad, el mercado, el teatro jaurez, la valenciana, el pipila, unas minas que no recuerdo como se llaman pero muy interesantes, en fin con solo recorrer la ciudad ya sea un poco a pie ya te distraes mucho. espero que tengas buena condicion porque la vez que fuimos nos cansamos mucho yo creo que por la altura, yo creia que era yo porque acababa de aliviarme de una bronquitis, pero resulto que todas las demas tambien estaban cansadas y se sentian igual que yo , asi que no ya dedujimos que era la altura. suerte y que te diviertas|`|93dfd452e2719cb3ed180afe280cbb22aa	el museo de las momias,la bocamina y templo de la valenciana, el museo de la inquicision, mineral de rayas, el monumento del pipila, el centro historico en el centro la basilica de nuestra sra de guanajuato,el templo de san diego,el teatro juarez, el jardin reforma, lacasa museo de diego rivera,la alhondiga de granaditas, el? templo de la compa?ia, etc|`|gDLeO1C3aa	las momias|`|ed6e133cdc64ce6448cd3dfd0924d0e3aa	Bienvenida. ahi te va un recorrido:<br>  Puedes ir al museo de las momias (eso es casi obligatorio), a la alhóndiga de granaditas (punto importante en la independencia de México) el mercado hidalgo (venden mucha artesania ahi), el templo de la basílica, (allí se venera a la virgen del rosario que fue traida desde espa?a como agradecimiento a la requezas en oro y plata que le produjo al reino espa?ol), el templo de la compa?ia de san felipe neri, el mayor de todos que se caracteriza por su cúpula que es copia de la cúpula de la basíslica de san Pedro en Roma, El Jardín Unión, El Teatro Juarez, con un poco más de 100 a?os, de estilo neoclásico y considerado como el 2do teatro más bello del país despues de Bellas artes en Cd. México.<br>  Las plazas y plazuelas como las del baratillo, san fernando y jardin reforma. las minas de la valenciana, rayas y el mineral de cata, el templo de san cayetano, patrón de los mineros, el monumento al Pípila, con una vista panorámica de la ciudad, el fonicular te puede llevar allí en un santiamén, el callejón del beso, la universidad de guanajuato, anteriormente era parte del convento del templo de la compa?ía, despues se convirtio en el colegio del estado y finalmente en Universidad. Es de estilo Neogótico. la casa de las leyendas.<br>  ?antros? el Grill y el capitolio<br>  ?museos? el museo de las momias, de granaditas, de olga acosta museo del pueblo, bryon, el iconográfico del quijote -te lo recomiendo-<br>  por las noches hay las tradicionales callejoneadas.<br>  ?vienes en semana santa? existen representaciones de las tres caidas en los templos de la compa?ía y en el templo de San Roque - te aconsejo que vayas a verlas-<br>  ve a la bocamina de valenciana, es muy interesante bajar (aunque sea un poquito) a la mina.<br>  Dato interesante: la mina de la Valenciana tiene la forma de la corona del rey de espa?a debido a la riqueza que le dio a dicho reino.<br>  ?hoteles? los hay desde caros como el castillo de santa cecilia, el casa colorada -no te lo recomiendo porque es muy bonito, muy caro, pero si te vas a pasar tooodo el día en la calle, no vale la pena pagar tanto por ello- y hasta muy económicos como los hosteles, muy populares en el centro, con la ventaja de que puedes estar de vago y tener un lugar donde dormir y comer, despues de todo ?quién viene a Guanajuato si se va a quedar encerrado en su hotel? nadie, mejor uno barato y que te alcanse para más cosas como souvenirs.<br>  Ojo: en lugares como las momias o el pípila por verte cara de turista te querran cobrar de más, busca donde sea el precio más justo.<br>  Bienvenida y diviértete|`|2gundrhSaa	pues yo te recomendaria que tomaras un tour por que esa ciudad es peque?a pero enredosa, con las calles muy angostas y los camiones le echan el carro a uno como si no fuera suficiente que las calles esten angostas<br>  <br>  si tienes tiempo te recomiendo que recorras ese estado que tiene mucha riqueza cultural<br>  por ejemplo puedes ir al cerro del cubilete donde hay un cristo en un cerro como el de rio de janeiro<br>  o puedes ir a dolores hidalgoo san miguel de allende y luego regresar a guanajuato<br>  <br>  espero que te sirva saludos

Their are so many types of airfare nowadays.<br>  <br>  1.PUBLISH FARE-These are the common fares that can be found in online or at the ticket counter. <br>  <br>  2.WEBFARES-This fare can only be booked ONLINE.

I have done this before. (I had to get my ticket at the airport because I wanted to use a paper coupon) They would only hold it 'til the end of the day, though.

EqknJFZCaa	I've lived in the Eastern Suburbs of Sydney for 20 years and the Northern Beaches for two years. I choose the beach-y lifestyles as I love the water. <br>  <br>  A few of the things I love about the city is that it has the 'get up and go' of major cities without the craziness. I also love the outdoor lifestyle. <br>  <br>  Property is expensive, for example, a 2 bedroom, 100 m2 apartment in a trendy suburb will sell for over $1 million. <br>  <br>  There are lots of great restaurants that are inexpensive and because it is a major Australian city there are lots of entertainment options from movies to live performances and sporting events.<br>  <br>  There is cultural diversity which is great. The people are fairly friendly, but the drivers can be a bit rude and aggressive on the roads.<br>  <br>  The weather is fantastic, I grew up in Canada, and I definitely prefer the warmer climate. It can be humid and average city temperatures can range from lows of 17oC to highs of 32oC in summer and from 7oC-17oC in winter. A sunny winter day can even get up to 22oC.<br>  <br>  Even though it's a major Australian city there are still plenty of parks, outdoor areas and of course the gorgeous beaches which I think are some of the most beautiful in the world.|`|hT7BhNamaa	Josimity Sam, I have now traveled to Australia about 5 times, and planning another trip (I'm from Montreal Canada). As for Sydney Melbourne and other parts I have been to down there, it is of the best kept secrets of a lifetime. The people are absolutely fantastic, I go as far as saying some people got offended that I wouldn't have a drink with them (I ended up making time). The life style, has to be seen and experienced to be believed. The average Aussie is very hard working (what I noticed).

dbc25c3a5fe007881fbc8aaca5db777baa	?Hola! Pienso que 5 horas está bien. La visita al Louvre cansa y uno no puede recorrerlo como si fuera una carrera. Como ya veo que tienes pensado hay que seleccionar que ver. Dependerá de tus gustos personales.<br>  <br>  A mi personalmente me gusta mucho la historia así que dediqué tiempo a las antigüedades egipcias, griegas y romanas. También me impresionaron las esculturas que alberga el Louvre. Menos famosas que las pinturas pero sombrosas. Y de las colecciones de pintura elegí italiana y espa?ola. Y claro, entre paseo y paseo, ves esos magníficos reclamos (La Venus de Milo, la Gioconda,etc).<br>  <br>  Otra cosa digna de ver es el propio Louvre. Sus techos, sus paredes, por algo fue un palacio.<br>  <br>  Venus de MIlo<br>  Victoria de Samotracia<br>  Gioconda<br>  Caballos de Marly (Patio Marly) (esculturas)<br>  Esclavos moribundo y rebelde de Miguel ángel (esculturas)<br>  Cristo y Abad Ména Baouit (pintura) (antigüedades egipcias coptas)<br>  Código de Hammurabi (antigüedades orientas:Mesopotamia y Anatolia)<br>  La Libertad guiando al pueblo de Delacroix (pintura francesa  siglo XIX)<br>  El patizambo de Ribera (pintura espa?ola)<br>  <br>  Link del Louvre en castellano:<br>  <a href="http://www.louvre.or.jp/louvre/espanol.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.louvre.or.jp/louvre/espanol.h...</a><br>  <br>  Visita virtual:<br>  <a href="http://www.louvre.or.jp/louvre/QTVR/espanol/intro1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.louvre.or.jp/louvre/QTVR/espa...</a><br>  <br>  Al entrar coge un mapa( por idiomas no será) y tienes la distribución planta por planta. De todas formas en el link que te puse puedes ver en colecciones lo más importante y donde está.<br>  <br>  ?Qué lo disfrutes!|`|BPvCXcKGaa	MONA LISA! tienes q verla <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.louvre.or.jp/louvre/espanol.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.louvre.or.jp/louvre/espanol.h...</a>|`|b62399afa01b34f0624f15e861011df0aa	Pues que no pierdas tu tiempo valioso con la MONA. De todas maneras no podras verla debido a la  cantidad de gente que te impide verla  y a su distancia que se hubica.|`|25e10e7fa42dc0225585171ea774719eaa	Ya te han puesto el enlace de la página web del Museo, asi que no voy a dártela. Solo comentarte un par de cositas.<br>  La Mona Lisa, ver, ver, lo que se dice ver, si tienes suerte igual. Me explico: la han puesto al otro extremo de la entrada del Louvre, o sea que tienes que recorrerte el Museo entero antes de llegar. No tendrás pérdida, porque además de estar bien se?alizado donde se haya este cuadro, solo tienes que guiarte por los miles de japoneses con cámara que van como posesos a verla. Después una vez llegado allí, (vas a tardar, ya lo verás), el cuadro es diminuto, y siempre tienes delante los otros miles de japoneses que todavía no han podido llegar o que tu has adelantado. Horrible.<br>  <br>  El resto de las cosas, es cuestión de gustos, puesto que hay mucha pintura, escultura, etc. y claro todo depende de tus preferencias. Yo las 3 veces que he ido además de una visita un poco en general, me he detenido en las dos salas de arte Egipcio, puesto que soy una enamorada de esta cultura, y tienen verdaderas preciosidades, y además no suele haber mucha gente, con lo que se puede disfrutar perfectamente.<br>  Pero claro a lo mejor a tí no te gusta.

AA12225622	That is an interesting question.<br>  <br>  I am a California native, however I have done a bit of travel, to the Midwest and Upstate New York and was amazed by the fact that every restaurant had a fish fry every Friday.

WouBNddIaa	hi , I am from Taiwan and happy for saving your question ?  <br>  <br>  The 228 Incident, also known as the 228 Massacre, was an anti-government uprising in Taiwan that began on 1947-02-27 and was violently suppressed by the Kuomintang (KMT) government. Estimates of the number of deaths vary from ten thousand to thirty thousands or more.[1][2] The Incident marked the beginning of the Kuomintang's White Terror period in Taiwan, in which thousands more Taiwanese vanished, were killed, or imprisoned. The number "228" refers to the day the massacre began: February 28, or 02-28.<br>  <br>  In 1945, 50 years of Japanese rule ended, and on October the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) handed administrative control of the new Republic of China (ROC) province to the Kuomintang. But one year (16 months) of KMT administration led to the widespread impression that the party was plagued by nepotism, corruption, and economic failure. Tensions increased between Taiwanese and the ROC administration. The flashpoint came on February 27, in Taipei when a dispute between a female cigarette vendor and an officer of the Office of Monopoly triggered civil disorder and open rebellion that lasted for days. The uprising was violently put down by the military of the Republic of China.<br>  <br>  The subject was officially taboo for decades. On the anniversary of the event in 1995, President Lee Teng-hui addressed the subject publicly, a first for a Taiwanese head of state. The event is now openly discussed and commemorated as Peace Memorial Day (traditional Chinese: 和平紀念日; simplified Chinese: 和平纪念日; pinyin: hépíng jìniànrì), and details of the event have become the subject of investigation. Every February 28, Taiwan's president gathers with other officials to ring a commemorative bell in memory of the victims. The president bows to family members of 2-28 victims and gives each one a certificate officially declaring the family innocent of any crime. Monuments and memorial parks to the victims of 2-28 have been erected in a number of Taiwanese cities, including Kaohsiung and Taipei.<br>  <br>  ... ........ .. .. . . .|`|qcv4ICEHaa	it is a holiday where Taiwanese remind themselves that one day, the 外省人or Nationalists will pay for murdering tens of thousands of innocent civilians.  It is a day when we mourn for our dead and prepare to avenge those criminals.|`|4ab2ea36c0069d71d94055356c32ea00aa	Taiwanese sometimes have a way of naming holidays with the date.  2/28 is known as 228.  In 1947, on February 27, the police went to confiscate contraband cigarettes from a lady.  They took money as well and when she was trying to get the money back, the police cracked her in the skull with a pistol.<br>  <br>  A group of Taiwanese chased the officers and shots were fired.  The next morning (2/28), while Taiwanese were protesting and calling for the arrest of those officers, security officials started firing on the crowd using machine guns.  It sparked a time when people were killed for something as simple as walking down the street.  Many arrests were made and people simply disappeared.  <br>  <br>  2/28 is a day to remember the tens of thousands of people that died during that time period, especially on that day.  It was a horrible time for Taiwan and I'm glad we're at least in an era where that's not an immediate threat.|`|34SAe5k6aa	In Taiwan, Feb. 28th is a very special day. It's known as "Last Day of February Day," and it's the day when the people turn the pages of their calendars to March. But not until it hits midnight. So technically, they turn their calendars at the very beginning of March 1st. It's kind of like new years eve, except no one parties or even gives a crap.

AA10849579	I live in Dorchester and go to UMASS. There are some parts that are very nice (like the Neponset area). Living somewhere on the redline would be best if you will be attending UMASS. I would look for an apartment in Quincy, as they are also very affordable and convenient to the redline and the highway.|`|LcURWscBaa	Dorchester is a rat hole.  You can live anywhere within reach of the T and commute just fine.  Best of luck.|`|stUY1k7Uaa	When I went to UMB, I lived at harbor point, which are the apartments right next to the school, for a few years. I lived there with 3 other roommates, so rent was low and affordable. It was safe, although not as safe as a suburb. I know Dorchester is known for high crime and such, but living right near UMB is not too bad because it is the nice part of Dorchester, since there are tourist attractions such as the JFK library, and you will be fine as long as you mind your own business. Harbor point has a lot of families living there, and there are a couple of schools (elementary, middle?)on the same street, so there are lots of kids. Therefore, it's a bit family oriented relative to the rest of Dorchester. Harbor point is close enough to UMB that you can walk.<br>  <br>  If you want to live in Harbor point, let the housing office at the school know and they can hook you up with a room and roommates.<br>  <br>  I don't really advice living at Back bay. I personally love back bay and would want to live there, but I would definetly not want to commute everyday for 45 minutes in rain, shine, or snow.

I flew a route like this in training. <br>  It depends on the aircraft you are flying on because they all have different cruising speeds. But, I would say the average flight time is around 1 HOUR 11 MINUTES. Also, there is a headwind and tailwind factor that plays into this flight time. <br>  <br>  Enjoy your trip.|`|IBMDQpmRaa	Northwest has three flights a day from Memphis to Oklahoma City in small jets.

The good thing with this site though is, if a paid member emails you, you can email them back.<br>  <br>  And if you do find love, be prepared to be a difficult long distance relationship (LDR).

I know someone work worked for a place that was over $150 a night and the budget for food was about $2 a day.  I've visited a couple and I don't think I would stay even for free.  I really hate the wrist band thing and as soon as anyone from an AI leaves the place they are immediately marked as someone who can pay the highest price.<br>  <br>  In the town I was staying in there was an epidemic at a local All Inclusive from food poisoning.  Buffets sitting in 80 degree heat for three hours is a quick way to spend most of your vacation in the bathroom. 30 people got sick at the All Inclusive I heard about and no one got a penny in compensation.|`|65Rzxlv2aa	The best deal I know of in the Caribbean is the BEAUSEJOUR RESORT and MARINA.  It's operated by the family of the Count de Serindan since his death and is a fabulous place to stay.<br>  <br>  It's on the private tropical island of Saint-Jacques del Alises, which is southeast of Guadeloupe and northwest of Dominica.  The island has about 42,000 inhabitants, most of whom live in the capital of Port Plessis.<br>  <br>  Beausejour Resort is part of the Count's estate that has been opened up to outsiders since his death.  Each 'room' is a stand alone cabana with it's own section of private beach.  The rooms are stocked with fresh fruits and liquor every day.  Snorkeling and SCUBA diving are some of the best in the Caribbean.  The BEST PART is.. it's just $25 PER PERSON PER DAY... and that is a bargain in any language.<br>  <br>  The shopping in Port Plessis is fantastic.  ALL the shops are duty free and the merchants all speak excellent English.<br>  <br>  The only drawback is, since the Europeans discovered it, the resort is booked almost completely, but if you try to book early, you may luck out.<br>  <br>  Hope you get a chance to enjoy this beautiful island that the friendly people who own and run it.|`|2ldEGsjwaa	you must go to cancun !!!!!!!!!<br>  RIU CANCUN= (all inclusive) the best, is in hotel area and walking distance from the night life  (the best) i could go every year !!!!!!FOOD /SERVICE/PLACE IS THE BEST !!!!!!|`|yWjdRuhuaa	Those places like Cancun that others suggested are not even in the Caribbean.

xIHgTqVhaa	I'm a former Flight Attendant and I now fly a lot with my three children. I've flown both with a lap baby and a bassinet and with my under-2 with their own seat. <br>  <br>  For both comfort and safety, a car seat goes far beyond a bassinet. These are only for convenience and really don't protect a child in an emergency. In fact, they have to be stowed for take-off and landing.<br>  <br>  It would be far wiser to keep your child's seat and use the car seat on the return portion of your flight. <br>  <br>  Some airlines also have rules about them. I know one airline only allows children in it if they're asleep. In turbulence, you are often required to remove the child from the bassinet and hold her, possibly waking her. If you use the car seat, she can stay in it for all phases of the flight and will not have to be removed for turbulence.<br>  <br>  You didn't say what airline you're flying but on a U.S. company, if you've purchased a seat and bring a FAA approved car seat on board, it's your *right* to use it to keep your baby safe. By contrast, the bassinet can be dodgy. The airlines are under no obligation to provide you with one or to seat you where one can be used. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.faa.gov/passengers/fly_children/crs/" rel="nofollow">http://www.faa.gov/passengers/fly_childr...</a> <br>  <br>  Most bassinets are located in bulkhead seats, those with the wall in front. They may reserve these for lap babies. This may be true but I wouldn't compromise my child's safety by using it instead of the car seat. <br>  <br>  On a side note, many bassinets will only hold the smallest of babies. You may go through all this trouble only to learn that your child exceeds the limits of the bassinet.<br>  <br>  When the seatbelt sign is off, you are not required to keep her in the car seat. You can get up and move with her. <br>  <br>  For take-off and landing, please make sure she is in the seat, securely strapped in. There is no reason to remove her during those times. If she is unhappy, comfort her while in the seat. Most passengers are awake during those times anyway. <br>  <br>  It is a myth that children have to drink or suck on something during take-off and landing. If her ears are clear and healthy, she'll have no problems with the pressurization changes. I have never, ever had any problems with my three children in all the flights they've taken. <br>  <br>  Hope you get better seats on the way home but please don't opt for the bassinet!|`|keGOvavbaa	The answer that the airline gave you was correct -- the bassinets provided by the airline are typically only for those passengers who have lap infants, and not for those passengers who have paid for a seat for their children.  (Presumably, it's because the passengers with lap infants don't have anywhere else to put their child for a little while, and the persons who buy the extra ticket with a seat do have a place for them -- the seat they purchased.)<br>  <br>  As for whether you should simply get a refund and use the lap infant service, there are several things you should consider:<br>  <br>  1)  If the ticket you purchased is non-refundable, the best you're going to get is a credit that can be used towards another flight (less the applicable change fee on the fare).<br>  2)  Lap infants are only those children under 2 -- if your child is 2 or older, they are ineligible to be lap infants and must have their own seat.<br>  3)  Depending on the destination and the airline, lap infants may not be free.  Though most airlines in the US don't charge for lap infants on domestic flights, they do often charge for lap infants on international flights.  The charge is typically 10 percent of the adult fare, but some airlines charge based on the full fare.  If you are flying on an airline that charges based on the full fare, it's entirely possible that the discount ticket you bought is actually cheaper than the lap infant fare, given that full fare on international flights may be several thousand dollars.|`|pXkWoqKjaa	idk...<br>  it's stupid though and unfair
AA10939273	Try taking breaks at gas stations with high traffic.  The traffic can provide you with a safety cushion.  Rest stops tend to be lonely at times with no sense of security.  If you decide to stop at a gas station, park away from the main entrance but in view of the employees.  Although it is not there job to keep you safe while you nap, there always on the lookout for any potential trouble.

VYCLwKwNaa	It depends on the time of year. During the summer, if you aren't in a hurry (and don't mind mosquitoes), you could hitchhike or ride a bicycle or motorbike. Dress warm for the trip through the mountains.<br>  <br>  Alaska Airlines has a web special to Juneau right now. You could fly there and take the ferry. No way does a trip south cost $8000. You can get a cheap one way airline ticket to Seattle for less than that and take the train or a bus to Vancouver. Even if you bought a round trip ticket and threw away the return part, it wouldn't cost anywhere near even $1000. You could also look into flying from Fairbanks to Whitehorse Yukon and getting another flight to Vancouver from there, or find someone driving from Whitehorse to Skagway or Haines.(not Haines Junction---Haines on the coast)<br>  Did you look on Travelocity and other web travel sites to see what you could find for airfare?<br>  <br>  There is a rider board at the University of Alaska Wood Center where you could look for people needing riders, or ask for a ride, and you could also advertise for a ride on the Alaska Craigslist. Expect to help pay for gas and possibly your share of a hotel room. Bring warm clothes in case the car breaks down. You will be crossing the Canadian border, so you will be asked to show a passport, possibly searched for drugs, firearms, etc. and may be asked to demonstrate that you have enough money to get out of Canada back into the USA.<br>  <br>  If you wish, you could hitchhike all the way down the Alaska highway and get pretty close to Vancouver. Bring food and stories to share with whoever picks you up. Offer to, or be prepared to, be left on one side of the border and walk through, to be picked up on the other side of customs. Drivers know that if you are caught with drugs, weapons, etc. their vehicle will be confiscated, and they will not want to take that risk.<br>  <br>  If you can get to Haines or Skagway, you can indeed take the ferry down to Bellingham.The ferry (Alaska Marine Highway System) is much cheaper than a cruise ship but cruises the same waters, and you can sleep for free in the Solarium, which is a covered deck that has infrared lights. You'll need a sleeping bag. Sometimes, you can sleep on the floor in one of the indoor lounges, too. This time of year, you may be traveling with the Juneau basketball team, a school choir, etc. Staterooms are available on some ferries, but they cost $$. The solarium is a great way to meet fellow sojourners. They sell food on the ferries, but you can bring your own. No cooking on deck, though, so the best you can do for hot food is to get some hot water from the cafeteria for cup-a-noodles or cocoa. The ferry has showers, too. Once you get to Washington state on the ferry, you can catch a bus or train to Vancouver. If you mean Vancouver, BC, then expect to do the whole customs thing again. The last time I traveled from Seattle to Vancouver, there was an inexpensive airport shuttle, so you might look into seeing if there is one leaving from Bellingham for Vancouver airport. You can also just keep hitching. <br>  <br>  If you haven't hitched before: don't have tons of gear, stand tall, smile, look at the driver, don't scowl no matter how long you've been waiting, and clean yourself up. If you have dreads and ratty clothes, wear old camo. or somehow look sinister, you will be standing a looong time. Check out the driver and passengers before you get in. Keep your wallet in your pocket, not your pack, in case you get separated from your stuff. Be prepared to get out if the ride doesn't work out. <br>  IF YOU ARE FEMALE DON'T HITCHHIKE.  Call the tour companies to see if there is a bus going to Haines or Skagway, find a safe ride, look for an airline web special, borrow money from someone, but DON'T hitch or travel alone. Just Don't.|`|SHoIWZ56aa	hitch hike or jump on trains like chris mccandless<br>  into hte wild

gXJdryRNaa	I would start sorting through things now.  Take it one piece at a time.  <br>  <br>  Moving can be overwhelming so start in one room and when that room is done, move to the next room.  If you have kids at home, tell them to start going through their room and throw out the trash, donate any items to be donated and think about what they can live without (that will be packed up in boxes for the next few weeks).  <br>  <br>  Make sure you have plenty of different size boxes (including ones for hanging clothes).  If you are moving yourself (and not using a mover) don't forget special boxes for large pictures, mirrors, televisions, etc.  Also don't forget the packing material for fine dishware.  Use newspaper (or purchase a box of white paper) to use to wrap things in. Don't forget some black markers to write on the boxes what box goes in what room.  Makes unloading go a lot quicker.<br>  <br>  You don't want to wait until the last 2 weeks to do this or you won't be getting any sleep.  Spend an hour each evening going through your belongings to determine what you are taking and what you will be donating or tossing to the curb.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

pLkeooJ1aa	Most death, or most grave plots?<br>  <br>  I'd say, due to the war, and the happenings that occurred to start the war in Vietnam, their body toll is pretty high. <br>  However, The great wall of china might as well be a grave, since they tossed the workers in as they died, built over them and kept going.<br>  I don't think the Japanese would waste precious land by filling it with bodies, seeing as how their bedrooms look like drawers in a morgue. <br>  <br>  I'm not sure about the others. I would think that, due to smaller populations, places like Laos, Thailand and Singapore don't have any large, elaborate graves to speak of. I could be wrong, though.<br>  <br>  Sorry I was unable to answer your question, but I hope I helped.
wTeJulT5aa	I live in Saudi Arabia.  I am an American Muslim.  I believe that niqab (face covering) is highly recommended.  I love wearing it in Saudi Arabia because it's easy to wear here and I feel so comfortable wearing it.  When I go to the US to visit, I will not wear niqab.  I am the only Muslim in my family, so it's much better for me to uncover my face when I am around them.  I feel much more comfortable in the US wearing hijab only.  I will still wear abaya there, but I will wear the shoulder abaya and not the head abaya.  Many people in the US seem freaked out by the niqab, so I feel it's better not to wear it there.  I want people to look at Islam in a positive light when I'm there and not think that I'm being forced to cover my face.|`|AA10248239	Some of the women who do it probably are not serious about religion.  Some of them might do it through fear of being harassed.  I started wearing hijab in the USA, so I don't have a problem with it.

504EFHi3aa	You guys will have a great time!  One of my fav restraunts of all time is the eiffel tower in well... the eiffel tower.  Its located halfway up the tower and has an amazing view of the bellagiop fountains.  The service is perfect the food is the best ever.

They will know all the tricks to get it looking really good - I know from recent experience that wallpapering can be harder than it looks.<br>  <br>  As to the hourly rate, expect to pay around ￡50 per hour, but this will vary greatly - a one man business may be cheaper if it too small to be registered for VAT.|`|bdc81a350221a05348d3b5708b5daa86aa	Do you not have a friend that can help because a joiner wouldn't really be interested in the table or the wallpapering. and they would charge not far of a ￡100 if not more
XASWYw4vaa	Rome is interesting, however I've only been twice.  The first time I went I visited the Colosseum and the roman forums and such not, and they're definably one of the must sees when you visit, but the rest of the city is rather amazing as well.<br>  The subway system is easy to navigate and reasonably priced and the people are all nice enough.  <br>  There's beautiful architecture to admire when you go on a walk around the city and plenty of interesting stores besides your typical name brand chains.  <br>  despite Rome not having all your typical Italian dishes that Americans are used to when they eat Italian, the food is superb, however mealtimes are different. Something to take into account that can be a minor annoyance to people who like to have their whole schedule planned out to a tee.<br>  <br>  Over all, Rome is a wonderful place to visit, and highly recommended over other cities such as Venice and Milan.|`|4xOXiZcNaa	Of course I've been in Rome... several times, in fact... so why would I not be liked?.. I found the Romans interesting, if not just a bit daft.|`|VMXl7Up1aa	Beautiful city full of life and history and too many wops.
NM1L4B0Vaa	As someone who has travelled throughout South America and has many friends from different countries I would have to say that the coolest place is Argentina.  It is not the cheapest country to visit of all the South America countries but it is definitely still cheap.<br>  <br>  The singles scene in Buenos Aires is fantastic and they have so many different bars and other places you can meet other singles.<br>  <br>  Tennis - Argentina has some of the best tennis players in the world, so there are definitely places for you to play tennis and meet other tennis players.|`|ugvCypDJaa	Bogota DC - colombia<br>  or medellin|`|W5VqTPQRaa	All those other places are great, but I personally recommend Buenos Aires, Argentina. It's a great city with its own unique flavor and culture. There are lots of museums, art galleries, concerts and beautiful architecture and history, if that is your thing. You can go to a tango show, a soccer game, skydiving or just walk along the beautiful Rio de la Plata. It is only a short local flight away from some of the most incredible natural wonders of the world, including Tierra del Fuego and the Iguazu waterfalls. Also, BA boasts the best nightlife in Latin America (and the world?) with bars and clubs that don't shut down until well past the sun comes up. <br>  <br>  I've traveled around most of South America and Europe, and BA is still my favorite place to go. There is a reason why some many people who come here to visit end up staying for some much longer!|`|LzM4ZA4Maa	Lima is not expensive. There are many places where u can play tennis but most of them are expensive, although there are some cheap places too. If ur single then cool, most lima girls are attracted by foreigners so u may have plenty of them interested or curious about you hehe.<br>  <br>  On the contrary, Lima is too big, there is too much contamination & pollution, extreme humidity & people stealing. <br>  <br>  I don't have enough info to tell about other cities, just commenting.|`|8HhkpFUHaa	I assume by coolest you are not referring to the weather.  I love Bogota, Colombia.  Lima, Peru is also high on my list.  Comparatively, Lima is less expensive, but neither is "break the bank" expensive.|`|8gVsnVMSaa	Montevideo, Uruguay is very cool!|`|KA5u1sYsaa	The best destination in all LATIN AMERICA!!!

Winter is short, but cold and summer is.. HOT. But I wouldn't live here unless you want to live in an apartment.|`|ZAQCvcIyaa	New Hampshire is nice. It is fairly cheap to live and no sales tax. Weather is nice in the summer but cold and snowy in the winter.
mZ1tUoacaa	better go to the authorized maruti show room in your locality rather than getting predictions from public.
wo0UY4Vfaa	Eh... People worry too much. Barcelona is already loaded with tourists as it is, so you won′t stand out too much. I seriously hear just as much English on the streets there as I do Spanish. And just because Spain is in Europe doesn′t mean they never wear shorts... They do.<br>  <br>  The only thing I can think of that REALLY makes you stick out is a baseball cap. They don′t exist here.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, just go with shorts, capris, tanktops, and t-shirts. As far as being too short... That′s up to your own discretion. If you like to show off 99.9% of your legs, go for it. Spanish people will only make the same assumptions Americans would... :p<br>  <br>  If you have any questions, feel free to email me.|`|824Md65waa	Bluedevil said it right, people worry too much about standing out in another country.  Let's face it, you aren't a local and your style will probably be a little different.  Be prepared for it to be hot and dress accordingly.  I saw plenty of people in shorts and capris when I was there in September.  Worry less about looking the part and more about enjoying an amazing city and the experiences you will have there.|`|MIl0wmRgaa	go to the beach or hwaii or cancun|`|pTLcvsVfaa	I agree with the guy above, people worry way too much.<br>  <br>  Wear what you are comfortable in. No one is going to judge you, and if they do they are pathetic. It can be very hot in barcelona in the summer, I remember wearing shorts everywhere. As did other people. At night you may want to have a pair of pants or jeans. But again, dont sweat it.|`|UAMtRFruaa	Spaniards don't wear shorts. Light weight fabric and loose tops is the fashion.

AA11082761	Greyhound from El Paso to Dallas then DART (Dallas Area Rapid Transit) to Plano which is a Dallas suburb.|`|W7LGoC3yaa	There's no bus that goes from El Paso to Plano.  You could take Greyhound (if you dare) from El Paso to Dallas, but then you'd have to get a taxi or take  DART into Plano.
Qmnae2qzaa	Yes you can buy direct at the station also without reservation,but it is cheaper if you buy online in advance and either print out yourself, or pic the ticket up at the station.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Of course you can buy a ticket at the station before you leave. Check which trains are cheaper - the EC (Eurocity) or IC (Intercity) trains tend to be more expensive.|`|AA10678637	If you want really cheap, buy a "Bayern-Ticket", it costs 18 Euro and is valid for one day in all regional (slow) trains in Bavaria. As Salzburg is right at the border with Germany, it is valid there as well.<br>  <br>  You just can't use the IC, EC or ICE trains, only the slower regional ones.<br>  <br>  The ticket can be bought at any station in Munich and even from the ticket machines.
TbiSBXclaa	Canton is real nice. So is Cartersville, Acworth is near the lake and Kennesaw itself is nice.  Woodstock a little less but still very livable.<br>  <br>  Marietta is the biggest city in Cobb County but still small compared to Atlanta. It is a very nice place to live.|`|kF2TI78kaa	i don't know if this is close enough but,it's in the same general area.<br>  i might suggest lawrenceville(where i live) or lilburn,around that general area|`|LsAArkUyaa	Well, Kennesaw itself is a pretty good place. I would just avoid the south end. Acworth is just North of Kennesaw, and just north of that is Cartersville. Cartersville is nice. Still fairly small but is growing a lot. It is close enough to the interstate that you can be in Atlanta or Chattanooga in no time. I know several in White, which is north east of Cartersville. It is a very rural area, but once again close enough to I-75 so that you have easy access to just about everything.|`|8aL1bsi3aa	Cumming! =D<br>  It's growing in population very VERY quickly though...|`|QstEk6PZaa	Cartersville|`|e8851b9f0ff261603f2a648b1ce253ccaa	Cartersville or Adairsville

AA10042296	At the Mexican border you'll need the original and two copies of:<br>  Your driver's license<br>  Proof of ownership of the car<br>  Proof of Mexican auto insurance<br>  FM-T (tourist card)--get these things before you get to the counter for the temporary import sticker.<br>  <br>  And a credit card (Amex, Visa or MC).  The credit card will be swiped at the border and then if the car doesn't leave the country when you do, you will be charged a fine.|`|AcmfbJVpaa	don't go to Mexico is real bad in there and you will get kill just for your car and your documents|`|818a6c4a96262d3d9669cd5c91b5efaeaa	Yes, you do. See site below.  You need a Mexican car permit and Mexican car insurance.  If the car is financed, you must have a notarized letter from the financier , on their letterhead, giving you permission to take the car  into Mexico.  Most financiers will not allow you to  take the car into Mexico until you have made at least 6 monthly payments on the car.|`|AA11287201	It really depends on how far down into Mexico you are planning to go. If you travel beyond the tourist zone, you will be asked to leave a deposit for the value of the vehicle at customs. If you are only going to border areas then you don't need to worry about it. As for papers or permits you won't need any other than current registration to prove that the vehicle is yours.

pcHp7Dgkaa	Almost everywhere is Australia is safe, so you can largely take safety out of the equation but I'm afraid that 'inexpensive' and 'not far from the beach' are a bit contradictory. The closer you get to the beach, the more expensive the accommodation will be so you may need to be prepared to do a bit of driving.<br>  <br>  The best place for you will depend to a large extent on the type of climate you would prefer. <br>  <br>  Brisbane is subtropical and warm to hot all year around with warm, dry winters and hot, wet(tish) summers. Brisbane's bayside beaches are terrible and you will need to drive for over an hour to get to a decent beach. Mind you, when you get there, it will be one of the better beaches in the world. Housing in Brisbane is expensive until you get well out of town.<br>   <br>  Sydney's climate is temperate with cool to cold winters and very warm to hot summers and rain all year around. Sydney is our most expensive city for accommodation but it has great beaches.<br>  <br>  Newcastle and Wollongong are both nice provincial cities on the coast with good weather and beaches and not too far from Sydney. Accommodation will be cheaper than Sydney.<br>  <br>  Melbourne has a very variable Mediterranean climate with cool to cold, wet (when there's no drought) winters and warm to very hot, dry summers. Accommodation can be expensive until you get well out of town. Nice beaches but no surf. Housing can be relatively inexpensive in some of the distant bayside areas like Frankston though parts of Frankston can be pretty dodgy.<br>  <br>  Geelong is a regional city about 70km from Melbourne. That could be worth looking at for cheap accommodation not too far from the beach. Get advice about the area though - some parts of Geelong are a bit dodgy.<br>  <br>  Adelaide has a similar climate to Melbourne but isn't as variable. It's our cheapest capital city for accommodation and has nice beaches though I think it's expensive to live near them.<br>  <br>  Perth's climate is temperate though it can get very hot in summer. Accommodation can be expensive until you get well out of town.

As 1 poster mentioned though, they are not turned on and off on a schedule, they are a natural phenomenon.  You will not see them in Edmonton you need to head north away from the city lights, out past Namao, Fort Saskatchewan, St Albert, out in relatively open country.<br>  They are triggered by solar activity, not the temperature.|`|U9bQgfY9aa	I grew up in Edmonton and in 20 years I only saw them once. On a country road near Fort Saskatchewan. And it has to be very cold, like 40 below and clear to see them.<br>  <br>  The lights of the city wash them out too much to see them in the city.|`|ae8698040f8ea15e3056dce384194b3eaa	Second responder spoke volumes, the lights of Edmonton tend to drown out the phenomenon the first guy spoke of. Basically, the further north you go, the better the chance to see the lights, I worked out of Yellowknife for awhile and saw them with regularity but like the first guy says, they are random and depend on certain atmospheric conditions so no guarantees as to when or where. Beautiful sight when they do happen but city lights obscure them big time. Take a 10-12 hour drive north to Hay River or at least get way out of the city.|`|2wyDALHgaa	The reason you can't find the schedule for them is because they are completely and totally random based upon atmospheric conditions and sun spots.  One never knows when they will show.  Its a natural phenomenon and they don't follow a set schedule.|`|XXRxlBBEaa	I lived in Edmonton for 14 years and always saw them... best places to see them, go to farmland/bush type areas (north of Lake District, Edmonton).... the further you are away from city lights the better.

psbsMxSBaa	Hello there!<br>  I've been to HK twice last year!  And it's such a great place!  We actually stayed in HK Island but honestly, whether you stay in Kowloon Island or HK island, it wouldn't make a big difference at all.  Both Islands have so many tourist spots, huge malls, markets, etc...Rates on hotels are also kinda alike.  A lot of fun on both islands!  Also, islands are connected via train(subway).  So, if you're in HK island you can get to Kowloon Island in less than 30 mins. or vice versa.  :)|`|DRPThd2Qaa	Hong Kong island considered to be more exclusive where the luxury hotels, luxury shopping malls and superb buildings existed. While stay there you will experience the hustle and bustle life of the charming HK's cosmopolitan atmosphere. Kowloon is the melting pot area, and less extravagant but it does'nt mean that you can find the super luxury hotels or shopping malls there. if you want to experience the modest HK then Kowloon is the best place. There are lots of famous street market to enjoy in Kowloon. <br>  Both areas has many tourist attractions, depends on which aspect you would like to experience more. The HK island offers you the old time charms, nice hills view and cosmopolitan buzz while Kowloon offers you the true cultural shopping experience. <br>  It doesnt matter where you are going to stay, each part gives you different experience and transportation in HK is easy and cheap, use the MTR(the subway). If you are going to stay in HK island, the Central and Admirality are offers you luxury hotels and closer access to some point of interest, or otherwise Wanchai area also a good choice. Causeway Bay area is also good but a bit too far.<br>  If you are about to stay in Kowloon, the best option would be around Tsim Sha Tsui, the heart of Kowloon or otherwise try Jordan, Yau Ma Tei or Mong Kok area. Unless you are using the Airport Express train to go from/to airport, staying in Kowloon would shorten your journey time to the Airport.|`|aDVNI2aOaa	I think you should go to Tsim Cha Tsui and go to Chongking Mansion.  There, they have money changers on the second floor that gives the best rates.  Remember, Hong Kong has a lot of Canadian born Chinese and naturalized Canadian citizens of Chinese ancestry living there, and Hong Kong is as much a second Vancouver as Richmond is Hong Kong.  You can often use Canadian money in Hong Kong.  I was glad to see they sell Canadian goods in Hong Kong as they are proudly Canadian.  You don't see that these chinese are proudly Canadian in Canada until you go to Hong Kong, where Canadian hockey jerseys like the Canucks are present, showing a bit of Canadian identity abroad.|`|g0YNQdL2aa	Personally I would choose Hong Kong Island, WAN CHAI area, quite diverse, you can get a underground thingy for the 3 days ,pretty cheap, then go anywhere you like.|`|972OdSIJaa	kowloon cuz its acceseble by train but both place are good cuz the place is like london where you can just take a train to most parts.|`|ZtPdNnIZaa	u should ask which district as some of our districts r v popular & full of malls / restaurants. the most convenience district in Kowloon wil be Tsim Sha Tsui & on HK Island wil be Causeway Bay.<br>  <br>  so u can either pick 1. they hv many many hotels all aro their districts. just pick 1 w/i ur budget. both locations r wt MTR (our underground)... easy access to any other area.

The UK, Germany, Italy, Japan etc, are more densely populated.<br>  <br>  The problem is, as others have suggested, that the population is not evenly spread. The east coast is much more densely populated. The west is mostly desert and mountains, so sparsely populated.|`|d36OrpbDaa	China, as a whole country, is not actually overcrowded.  The West and Central regions are much less populated.<br>  <br>  The areas that are overcrowded are the dense urban regions, typically along the Eastern Coastal region of China.<br>  <br>  This is a problem because there aren't enough jobs or living spaces to go around in just one city with tens/hundreds of millions of people.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, the hukou system in China is like an internal passport system, which basically states where you are allowed to reside in China (your home province, special administrative region, autonomous region, or etc.).  It is extremely difficult to change this - so if you come from a poor village in central China and want to go to, say, Shanghai, you will be ineligible for residency, jobs, etc. that native Shanghai residents can get.  This would make you a second-class citizen in that new area, and poverty and homelessness can result.<br>  <br>  This would be like if, in the US, you were only allowed to live in your home state, and could not move and live/work in another state.<br>  <br>  Also, uneven economic growth and development have led to some people to leave their home and go to these big Eastern cities, even if they can't get a good job and have to work illegally.  To them, it is better than doing nothing at home and starving.  This also leads to overcrowding of big cities on the Eastern coast.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, China has 20% of the world's population, but only 7% of the world's arable (farmable) land.  This leads to a huge problem of how to feed 1.3 billion people.<br>  <br>  Finally, in response to those who have stated that Chinese people have tons of children to support them - this is fundamentally untrue.  During Mao Zedong's rule, he promoted having as many children as possible.  But this has not been government policy - or even allowed - for several decades now. <br>  <br>  In China there is a strict "one-child policy" per couple.  Infanticide and abandonment of children (usually the girls) is a sad consequence of this policy.<br>  <br>  Typically, the only people allowed to have more than one child are those that are ethnic minorities, which make up around 8% of the population of China.  Also, if you remarry and one person in that new marriage has no biological children, you can have another child.  In some cases (like in rural areas), if your first child was a girl, you are allowed to have a second child.|`|Tz2D0grWaa	simply put, everyone wants to live in one area, spreading out population would not be a problem, but, everyone flocks to where the money is, so, popluation is a "problem"|`|ZpsbW8gHaa	trampling<br>  spread of disease<br>  and the inability to match the supply and demand
3K1QW7Oeaa	What to do in the two areas???<br>  <br>  More like, what's not to do in the two areas. By the way, Hollywood is in the Los Angeles district (about northwest of Downtown Los Angeles if you want to get technical).<br>  <br>  -Hollywood Boulevard: This is where you'll find the Walk of Fame (sidewalk stars) and Mann's Chinese Theater (stars' hand- and footprints), as well as the Hollywood and Highland shopping complex, the Kodak Theater and lots of fun Hollywood kitsch. Allow two to four hours to see it all, and while it's the one don't-miss attraction in Hollywood, go there last and stay into the early evening if you can.<br>  <br>  -Take a Real Studio Tour: If you're looking for a theme park with thrill rides, go to Universal Studios, but if you want an authentic, behind-the-scenes tour that shows you how movies are made, take a tour at one of the other studios instead. The tours take about two hours and studios are closed on the weekend, so this is a weekday activity only.<br>  <br>  -Farmers Market: It's not quite in Hollywood proper, but the Farmers Market is close by and a great place to get an inexpensive meal. Some say it's also one of the best places in Los Angeles to spot a celebrity. Early risers can start their day by eating breakfast here.<br>  <br>  -See the Sign: You can see the Hollywood Sign from many places around town, but a quick drive up Mulholland Drive or above the Hollywood Reservoir will reward you with a glimpse of living in the Hollywood Hills and get some great city views, too. Allow about an hour for the round trip drive.<br>  <br>  -Hollywood Bowl: This summer concert series is one of the best outdoor music experiences anywhere. This is an after-dark activity.<br>  <br>  -Sunset Strip: This section of Sunset Boulevard has a big reputation, but there's not that much to see, unless you want to go to the clubs at night.<br>  <br>  -Stars' Home Tour: Few of today's stars actually live in Hollywood, and much of what the guides tell you is made up or just plain wrong. There are better ways to spend your time.<br>  <br>  -Forest Lawn or Hollywood Forever Cemetery: Unless you're a fan of old Hollywood and want to pay tribute to the stars of yesteryear, these places won't hold much interest for you.<br>  <br>  -Universal Studios: It would take you a whole day just for Universal, and while it's a fun theme park, its studio tour is cursory and scripted.|`|YJevRzoMaa	try  www.seemyla.com   and/or   www.anaheimoc.org|`|N8wNmQShaa	There are literally hundreds of things to do here in LA. Here is my list of “must sees”. Visit as many as you have time for.:<br>  <br>  Disneyland: The Happiest Place on Earth. Half a billion visitors can’t be wrong. #1 Destination in SoCal.<br>  Universal Studios: A theme park that grew out of a studio tour. #2 Destination<br>  Even if you don’t visit Disneyland or Universal Studios Tour, Downtown Disney District and Universal City Walk are very fun places to visit for shopping and eating. And they’re free to visit. <br>  <br>  Hollywood: Enjoy the Walk of Fame, Entertainment Museum, Chinese Theater and more. You can see a lot for free. The Hollywood & Highland complex is AMAZING. It has lots of shops and restaurants, and the Kodak Theater (home of the Academy Awards). I also like the El Capitan theater, right across the street. And the Hollywood Bowl is a GREAT place to listen to concerts outdoors. <br>  <br>  Rodeo Drive, 90210: Packed with exclusive shops, full of gawkers. They all came to enjoy the excess. Free, unless you intend to buy something.<br>  <br>  Venice Beach: Los Angeles kitsch and over-the-top culture at its best. Here you'll find Muscle Beach, street performers and tacky shops galore. Fun, VERY interesting, but I avoid it after dark, when it gets a little TOO interesting for my taste. <br>  <br>  Santa Monica Beach and Pier: Great beach scene and a classic seaside amusement park, complete with antique carousel that has been in a lot of TV and movies. <br>  <br>  Santa Monica Third Street Promenade - Downtown Santa Monica's shopping promenade is often the scene of movie star-sightings. <br>  <br>  Sunset Boulevard: Perhaps one of the world's most famous streets, it began as a route between the stars' posh neighborhoods and the Hollywood studios. It runs from downtown to the ocean, passing through the "Sunset Strip" on its way. It makes for a fun drive. When you get to the ocean, stop at Gladstone's for Fish.<br>  <br>  Queen Mary: Once the largest ship afloat, she's been docked in Long Beach for longer than she sailed, and her elegance never fails to impress. Free to visit. You can actually stay on board, for a price.<br>  <br>  Farmers Market and The Grove - A new shopping complex right next to a Los Angeles landmark, The Grove and Farmers Market coexist. Enjoy a movie or shopping, and then take the trolley to the Farmers Market for lunch or dinner. It is right next to CBS, so walk across the lot to see if they are taping "The Price is Right". You might even get in.<br>  <br>  TAAB: The Americana at Brand- The newly opened TAAB, developed by the same group that gave us The Grove, breathes new life into Glendale, and gives all those hip people in Eagle Rock and the eastern half of LA a great place to go. <br>  <br>  Griffith Park - Home of the Los Angeles Zoo, Griffith Park Observatory, Travel Town, the Greek Theatre, and Gene Autry Museum of Western Heritage.<br>  <br>  Getty Museum - The Getty's architecture is so beautiful that it keeps me fascinated. No matter whether you like their art or architecture better (or maybe you'll just enjoy the view), the Getty is sure to please. Free.<br>  <br>  Attend a TV taping - You can get free tickets at audiencesunlimited.com, tvtix.com, or see the booth at Universal City walk. It's very interesting to see a show being taped. The most popular, by far, is the Tonight show with Jay Leno. Check the NBC web site for all the details there.<br>  <br>  Places to eat:<br>  If you're from Texas, I wouldn't go to a steakhouse here. You'll only be disappointed. However, LA is the home of the hamburger, as evidenced by two listings below. Also, you want to find a goo local Mexican food restaurant, since we have great Mexican food here (and Taco Bell is NOT Mexican food). <br>  <br>  In-N-Out Burger: Multiple locations, best burger in LA, ask anyone.<br>  Pink’s Hot Dogs: 709 N. La Brea, just north of Melrose. You might even see a celebrity. Maybe.<br>  Tommy’s Chili Burgers: Look for the shack, an LA tradition. The original location is at Beverly & Rampart, a couple miles west of downtown.<br>  Canter’s Deli: 419 N. Fairfax, between Beverly & Melrose. Near CBS, you might spot a celebrity.<br>  Phillippe’s: 1001 N. Alameda. Great roast beef sandwiches. Near Union Station and Olvera Street. Watch the mustard, it’s hot.<br>  The Pantry: Corner of Figueroa and 9th, downtown. Huge portions, they never close, GREAT steak and eggs.<br>  <br>  Places to Stay:<br>  Since LA is so spread out, there is no single place that is close to EVERYTHING. Most people who come here tend to stay in Hollywood, Santa Monica, or Anaheim.<br>  In Hollywood, I recommend the Renaissance Hotel at Hollywood and Highland, the Best Western Sunset Plaza, or the Holiday Inn Walk of Fame. <br>  In Santa Monica, the Holiday Inn Santa Monica is close to the pier and reasonably priced.<br>  In Anaheim, I recommend the Howard Johnson (HoJo) Anaheim, and the Candy Cane Inn.|`|P5rfNdFEaa	Try Universal City Walk.

La Brea, just north of Melrose. You might even see a celebrity. Maybe.<br>  Tommy’s Chili Burgers: Look for the shack, an LA tradition. The original location is at Beverly & Rampart, a couple miles west of downtown.<br>  Canter’s Deli: 419 N. Fairfax, between Beverly & Melrose. Near CBS, you might spot a celebrity.<br>  Phillippe’s: 1001 N. Alameda. Great roast beef sandwiches. Near Union Station and Olvera Street. Watch the mustard, it’s hot.<br>  The Pantry: Corner of Figueroa and 9th, downtown. Huge portions, they never close, GREAT steak and eggs.<br>  <br>  Places to Stay:<br>  Since LA is so spread out, there is no single place that is close to EVERYTHING. Most people who come here tend to stay in Hollywood, Santa Monica, or Anaheim.<br>  In Hollywood, I recommend the Renaissance Hotel at Hollywood and Highland, the Best Western Sunset Plaza, or the Holiday Inn Walk of Fame. <br>  In Santa Monica, the Holiday Inn Santa Monica is close to the pier and reasonably priced.<br>  In Anaheim, I recommend the Howard Johnson (HoJo) Anaheim, and the Candy Cane Inn.<br>  <br>  Places to Shop:<br>  Third Street Promenade, Santa Monica<br>  The Grove, Los Angeles<br>  Americana @ Brand, Glendale<br>  Beverly Center, Los Angeles<br>  Citadel Outlets, Commerce<br>  Brea Mall, Brea<br>  The Block at Orange, Orange<br>  South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa<br>  Fashion Island, Newport Beach<br>  Santee Alley, Los Angeles|`|FgTkF31iaa	near  there the Hollywood Highland center (home of the Oscars) and Grumman's Chinese Theater.

h61UOPHMaa	There are many wonderful universities in Canada and you apply to them as you would to a university or college in the United States. Once you are accepted and make the decision to go then you need to get your passport and fulfill all the requirements for a Student Visa in Canada. I've posted the link to the Canadian Immigration website that has all the current information about what you're going to need to successfully obtain a visa...and weather conditions are dependant on where you are in the country. <br>  <br>  For the most part it's cold in the winter and hot in the summer...lol...you'll need to learn the metric system especially for driving since it's in Kilometers per Hour not miles, gas is not in imperial gallons but metric gallons. Laws are very similar to the united states, provinces are much larger than states...for example Texas fits into the Province of Quebec 3.4 times...we have "more than one road!"... Canada has a larger landmass than the United States and significantly less people so if you travel outside of major cities there are large areas that are unpopulated. <br>  <br>  The cost of living is higher, so be prepared, you might want to do some basic comparisons for food, clothing and gas based on your projected income. You'll find polite people, rude people, nice people nasty ones...same as the US...any other questions drop me a line and I'll be glad to give you my views...I lived in many provinces before moving to the US...|`|AA12095483	You first check out the colleges or universities that you would like to attend - you can google up Canadian universities to get a list - and then see which ones offer the majors that you would like to take.|`|azypqsphaa	u wouldn't like it|`|Twzg9s0caa	I have a friend who came from Orlando to go to school in London, Ontario and she is still living here. Just apply at universities and if you get accepted they will help you get a student visa. You just have to pay for it, or likely your parents.

UE1evlTlaa	I LOVE Mardi Gras at Universal!!!<br>  <br>  I live in Orlando and I make sure to hit one concert AT LEAST a year! Last year I saw the Go-Go's and this year I saw Ne-Yo. Both were GREAT!<br>  <br>  The concert is located inside Universal Studios (The STUDIO side amusement park). The concert is located on their newly built permanent stage in between Shrek 4D and Twister: Ride It Out. The concert is outdoors...so it is a rain or shine event. The concert runs for about 45 mins to an hour.<br>  <br>  So, if you are planning on going...to get your money's worth, I would definitely make a day of it...get a 1 Day 2 Park ticket. Start at Islands of Adventure and then head over to Universal Studios. As long as you are in the park by "closing" of the park on the given concert date you are automatically allowed to participate in Mardi Gras. If you leave to go to CityWalk for dinner or something, make sure to get your hand stamped to come back in. Also, make sure to come back in a timely manner because the lines to get in on Mardi Gras night can get QUITE long, especially the really big name acts.<br>  <br>  Check out the article I found below. It's a really good synopsis of the event and how you can actually spend your day for Mardi Gras. They also recommend ticket sources, things to do, etc.|`|tV7ZYIeEaa	I went for the neyo concert it was awesome.  Mardi GRAS festivities start at 5 wait maybe 6 over at Universal studios. The parade starts at 8 the concert is between twister and jimmy newtron ride it starts right after the parade has passed that area.

Food is good & weather is beautiful....the people are really friendly.  <br>  <br>  You can stay on an overnight boat on the backwaters which i understand is very peaceful & relaxing.  the taxi drivers are greedy outside of the hotels....so try to get a Tut Tut to travel around...the prices are very cheap.<br>  <br>  But - why go in July...it's monsoon time so you will not be able to go into the sea & it will be very hot, humid & tons of rain....which will bring more mosquitos!!  essential tip - take a torch!|`|PZJdWBQiaa	it's really good place  & this place will make you more close to nature.<br>  enjoy your trip.|`|Oc7pTOETaa	Trivandrum is an extremely hot place.

For a mere $1 you can eat like a King. <br>  <br>  Tourism has been booming here for a while , so you can find places to stay with modern amenities. <br>  <br>  Buy yourself a Lonlely Planet book for India, it is very very helpful.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your trip. <br>  <br>  PS - Don't miss their famous Ayuervedic Massage!
0pe8qW87aa	Can you look at this man and think, I would stand by you if you were in a wheel chair, badly burnt, or something else that real life throws at us. Can u imagine him doing the same for you?? Its not just about the butterflies etc. Would your family disapprove and you and him had to face the world together, with no support from your family?? Can you imagine what he would be like in 30 years time and you have been with only him in your life?? To know that you love someone, forsaking all others means that you take the realistic things into account. I don't mean to sound so boring, but they are things to have in mind when working your question out. I love my husband, and I know that it is love because I wake up everyday and thank god he is in my life, I can't imagine anyone else who I would rather be with.

I feel that importing cheap labour from China into Canada will also drive down the cost of labour in Ft McMurray Alberta so that they could stop paying so much overtime.  Also, immigrating many foreigners for unskilled labour will enable many jobs that are near minimum wage to actually become minimum wage, and to place them on 28 hours per week so that benefits do not have to be paid.  As a Human Resurce Manager, my dream is to see cutting back of over time and eventually cutting back full time to part time while producing more efficint workers, enabling foreigners a chance to come to the developing world.  This makes the world a more just place, and protectionism removed.
fd69272cc2b6016b2264e570e7b7a247aa	difficult to make any predictions nowadays but generally Malaysian weather - and also Borneo weather - is like sunny mornings, and some showers in the afternoons, with temperatures from 24-34C except in special climate zones such as Genting, and Mt Kinabalu. Wear light cotton trousers and shirts, because it is humid all year round, and always have something against the sun (like a hat and sunscreen) and something against the rain (like an umbrella) in your daypack.

6vzpHTqQaa	Which one is more fun?  Magic Kingdom<br>  <br>  The park has many rides, including Space Mountain, Splash Mountain, Big Thunder Mountain, Pirates of the Caribbean, Haunted Mansion, etc.  If you're taking little kids, they'll love it.<br>  <br>  As I've gotten older, I have gotten to fancy Epcot more.  Visiting the countries is great, and they have added rides such as Test Track and Soarin'.<br>  <br>  But, Magic Kingdom is more fun... to answer your question.|`|fMPyLqW4aa	You can get a Park Hopper option, though I think it is a rip off(unless you only play for 1 day) Epcot is more for adults and Magic Kingdom is more for kids.|`|rSq790ksaa	Epcot- Personally, it's boring. There are only two good rides there. Old people seem to love it there.<br>  <br>  I would definitley pick Magic Kingdom, there is enough there to keep you occupied all day and it's the best one, hands down.|`|9NpXU7D2aa	well i love them both but i'd definitely choose magic kingdom over epcot. <br>  <br>  magic kingdom has the classic rides like pirates of the caribbean, haunted mansion, its a small world, thunder mountain, space mountain, and splash mountain. <br>  its the most "disney" park. its what most people think of when they think of disney world.|`|J08K6Fqeaa	My boys were 10 & 9 on our trip, and they liked EPCOT better. They prefer more exciting rides like Test Track, Mission Space, and Soarin'. They also liked a lot of the educational experiences at EPCOT (much to my suprise), too.<br>  <br>  The Magic Kingdom is full of rides where you sit in a slow moving car/boat and just look at Disney animatronics. Its cool the first few times, but after a while its a bit boring.|`|giKCTfnfaa	magic kingdom definitely!  epcot is nice but there's not a whole lot to do as far as fun.|`|LixYvfoTaa	It's hard to answer that question because it ultimately depends on your tastes. Kids are an important factor--if you got 'em, I'd definitely hit the Magic Kingdom (assuming that they enjoy rides). If you don't have kids, and you're looking for something fun but aimed a bit more toward adults, then Epcot is your best bet.<br>  <br>  Magic Kingdom is the quintessential theme park. All the classics are there, including Space and Splash Mountain, Dumbo, Jungle Cruise, Pirates of the Caribbean, etc. Epcot on the other hand appeals mainly to an older demographic. It's split in two sections--World Showcase (giving visitors a taste of 11 countries) and Future World (very science-y). There are less rides here than at MK, and they may not be suitable for small children. However, in quality, I believe that the rides at Epcot far surpass the ones at MK. Soarin', Test Track, and Mission Space are the ones to hit here. If you want more information about the specifics of the rides at each park, as well as dining and entertainment information, I highly recommend PassPorter guidebooks. The guides are unbiased and contain a plethora of information.<br>  <br>  **Something to think about: This spring, the Flower and Garden Festival arrives at Epcot. If your party is interested in the outdoors, it's very entertaining and informational. However, I find it a tad boring. It's included with admission and runs from March 18 until May 31.|`|x9RDPwIZaa	It depends on what you want to do.  I don't feel it is a kids vs. adults question.  I am an adult and I prefer Magic Kingdom.<br>  <br>  Magic Kingdom has lots of characters, shows and rides for all ages.  It's magical and the essance of Walt Disney World.<br>  <br>  Epcot is more about dining, has only a few rides--most not geared to smaller children--and a few shows.  It's more "educational" in nature.  I like Epcot, but it isn't the park I'd do if I only have one day.<br>  <br>  Try: <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/1363327/how_to_research_a_disney_vacation.html?cat=16" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a>|`|nlRr07dRaa	old people like epcot better, you can experience traveling the world, without leaving orlando! best part is ifyou're old enough to drink, you can get beers from each country! =)<br>  <br>  as for Magic Kingdom, it is CLASSIC!!! if you've never been, it's a got to go to park!!!! that's where all the magic starts and all the characters from all your favorite disney movies!<br>  <br>  no alcohol what so ever in Magic kingdom|`|OoNivmTlaa	Depends on if you are taking kids.

AtjlmByAaa	Hi, these are expected to any underdeveloped countries like Phils.  There are lots of orphans because drought has a very high rate here.  Additionally, those parents who can't provide the needs of their children but still keep on making children just for the sake of their pleasure and self satisfaction and the fact that they are unaware of proper family planning due to lack of training and guidance.  Most of these kids would prefer to live in the streets and some goes under the shelter of DSWD because they were trying to get their needs that cannot get from their own home by begging from other people and to get away from mostly harsh treatments of their parents.  And, it may also a result of "high moral value" given by Phil. doctors  to the importance of conceiving and giving utmost attention to the pregnancy risks while other countries, like Norway, they don't give any medication (pampakapit) if the pregnancy is at risk, if it fails, then its not meant, how sad.  While others, some countries in Asia set a law for the nos. of  member in a family(limited to 2 siblings only).|`|tcmaLqWFaa	Their religion teaches them that any woman having a baby without first having a husband is a prostitute (whore).

ipw5zYZYaa	The product description for her book, Chasing the Dragon, says the following: <br>  <br>  <br>  Inside of Hong Kong lies the infamous Walled City. Strangers are not welcome there. Police hesitate to enter. It is a haven of filth, crime and sin. Prostitution, pornography and drug addiction flourish. Thirty thousand people-maybe twice that-live in a few cramped, dismal acres. Jackie Pullinger had grown up believing that if she put her trust in God, He would lead her. When she was 20 years old, God called her to the Walled City. She obeyed. And as she spoke of Jesus Christ, brutal hoods were converted, prostitutes retired from their trade, and heroin junkies found new power that freed them from the bondage of drug addiction. Hundreds discovered new life in Christ. Chasing the Dragon tells the whole amazing story-exactly as it happened.  <br>  <br>  Also, if you enter her name into any search engine, you will find various sites that recount her life.  Several of them say that after she graduated from college, she desired to be a missionary.  She was interested in Africa but after having a dream, she felt she should go to Hong Kong. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|3NKQUIglaa	a series of dreams and vivid experiences|`|aDVNI2aOaa	我的普通語不知道。|`|Dzt5qcadaa	because there was hot ladies and she is lesbian|`|PqdYPmzwaa	the hot ladies

ac7e0f50f58632b431b5cf5de0564ffbaa	A. No. It's a stupid idea. And I can say that because I live here, and see the consequences of the thousands of young people with the same idea. I take the subway and metrolink home, and see it all the time. Kids pimping themselves, strung out on dope, living in the streets and looking like crap, all because they had to "pursue their dream". Trouble is, 99% of them come here unprepared, with no money, no experience, no skills, and no plan. The thing that really kills me is that a lot of these kids really had it better where they were before they came, and they are either too stubborn or stupid to go back home. As a parent, I often wonder if parents know whatever happened to these young people. Maybe the kids left angry, but I have to think that no parent would ever wish this kind of life on their kids, no matter how rotten they were at home. (Just so you know, I use the term kid becuase I have one that's older than you are). <br>  <br>  And once you've seen a dead one, or hear about the ones liberated from being sex slaves in the valley, it really gets to you. That's why I don't spare the niceties when I tell people in your situation to stay the hell home.<br>  <br>  B. We recommend about $7000 as a bare minimum. Average rent for a 1BR here in a non-war zone is about $1200 per month. But with unemployment in LA above 12% and the classified ads fitting on a single page, I would not recommend coming here at this time.<br>  <br>  I don't think I could respect anyone who just "dropped everything" and left. Frankly, that's the chicken sh*t way out. If you want to diveorce your husband, fine. But at least tie up your loose ends before coming out here. You'll get a lot more respect.<br>  <br>  But why not try this? Come out for a visit. Walk the streets of Hollywood. Then see if your life is REALLY that bad. Try watching "It's a Wonderful Life" while you are at it.<br>  <br>  I don't know you, and I don't know your situation. And if I seem rather harsh, I would rather have you believe that about me and stay home ALIVE, rather than come out here and get hurt because I didn't have the nads to tell you it's not the right move.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|72f802b5a9052f334cc57c6950295e3caa	Honestly Cary, I would visit first then I would give it a shot.

Listen to him; he's dead right.|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	Oh boy, another one! Snap out of your dream bubble! Moving to LA is a stupid idea because of the economy and if you're already feeling trapped in Miami, expect LA to get worse!<br>  <br>  As of right now, because of the economy, a job opening in Los Angeles is almost non existent. With the closings of Shoe Pavilion, Linens-N-Things, Mervyns, and Circuit City, it's going to be EVEN MORE difficult. Just recently the unemployment rate went from 9.4% to 10.1%!!<br>  <br>  You will also need about $10,000 to start off.<br>  <br>  Decent prices start at $1000 mo. for either an extremely small studio or a 1bd/1ba apartment if you're lucky. There is no such thing as $550 mo. here. A minimum waged job alone will barely pay the rent. Remember, you need to eat, you need water, gas, electric, personal hygiene, etc.<br>  <br>  Bottom Line: Look elsewhere. In 3 months, you'll be back in Florida with no improvement whatsoever.|`|gDn1LVRxaa	I live in Los Angeles and have lived here my whole live. I don't know much about your specific information but all I can tell you is many, many people come to LA to be artists and it is very difficult to succeed. I recommend staying in school and finishing your degree so you have some backup plan, and visit LA before you decide to move so you know exactly where you are coming and what you are getting into. Good luck!|`|GrdPhzv2aa	Dont COME!!!!! California stinks!! Too Crowded...No Jobs...everything is expensive and with Arnold S. at the wheel its only getting higher!!!!

If you happen to be the lucky one, you get fame and success.  If not, you're ruined.  <br>  <br>  Thousands of people do this every year.  One or two become successful.  The rest end up on the streets.  <br>  <br>  I don't want to discourage you, but keep it real.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest having saved a minimum of $10,000 before you move.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	There are NO jobs here, so you may want to put that on hold for 2 to 3 years. It's terribly expensive here. A studio alone costs $900 and up. That means zero bedrooms!

hPdEZ4Ypaa	Mike, Cool inside information for you: Cruise lines will give you the military discount!!!  I can guarantee you one thing for certain. You won't regret going on a cruise, in fact, you'll want to become a repeat guest. In my opinion, cruises are the Holy Grail of vacations.<br>  Randall|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	The others told you great info on a military discount.  As for being 20, that limits you a lot.  Check out these websites.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.vacationstogo.com/cruise_age_requirements.cfm?id=npfy" rel="nofollow">http://www.vacationstogo.com/cruise_age_...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cruisesavvy.com/savvyguide/introduction_to_cruises/cruise_faq/are_there_age_restrictions" rel="nofollow">http://www.cruisesavvy.com/savvyguide/in...</a><br>  <br>   The lowest minimum age requirement for any cruise line is 18. The following cruise lines require that at least one person in each cabin is 18 or older: Cruise West, Cunard, Fred. Olsen Cruise Line, Oceania, P&O Cruises, Peter Deilmann, Regent (Radisson) Seven Seas Cruises, SeaDream, Star Clippers, and Uniworld.<br>  <br>  The following cruise lines require that either 1) All passengers in a cabin must be 18 or older, or 2) If anyone in the cabin is younger than 18 years old, someone in the cabin must be 21 or older: Disney Cruise Line, GAP Adventures, Silversea and Viking River Cruises. <br>  <br>  So it depends on who is sailing with you.  You can cruise Disney.  Or if you have a 25 year old with you, you can do Carnival and Holland.  Most others you'll need to be 21 (or married) first.<br>  <br>  Isn't that ridiculous?  You can't rent a car or book a cruise but you can fight overseas.<br>  <br>  Cruise lines charge per person so you will want someone to go with you to share your cabin--otherwise the price will be way more expensive.<br>  <br>  Carnival and Royal are going to be the most budget friendly.  Good luck!|`|X6rFPI2laa	A travel agent will be able to help you find the cruise you will most enjoy, and be able to answer all of your questions.  It will cost you NOTHING, but be of enormous value.  I always go through my travel agent, and she has consistently found even better prices than those advertised.  Have a ball!|`|fxfoA7Vzaa	Call a travel agent or Carnival Personal Vacation Planner and ask for the military rate. You can save 10-30% off of the lowest public rates. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately all of the major cruise lines require that you be at least 21 or traveling with a parent or guardian who is over the page of 25. The exception to the rule is if you are married, then it drops to 18 in most cases.|`|WWS3djdqaa	Cruises are great. They have tons of activities and are very much what you make them.. they can be very relaxing or so hectic you need another vacation. If you do choose a cruise make sure you do at least 7 days the short cruises are fine, but most people always say "I wish I had booked for longer" <br>  <br>  but if you are looking to drink, that will be a problem as the drinking age is 21... Go stay at a resort in Mexico... or Nicaragua the drinking age is 18...
bQraDPLUaa	If you are just moving here for college you should really look into student housing/dorms. As for a job you should look into your school's workstudy program which will easily work around your schedule, otherwise it all depends on you current skill set. <br>  <br>  Here is what I would consider a general budget:<br>  <br>  $1000 - Rent for a $2000 two bedroom apartment<br>  <a href="http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/abo/1067863646.html" rel="nofollow">http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/abo/10...</a><br>  <br>  $40 - Your share of utilites (gas and electric)<br>  <br>  $81 - Metrocard (might be going up to $103 soon)<br>  <br>  $200 - Food (this depends on how good your cooking skills are)<br>  <br>  $150 - Phone/Cable/Internet <br>  <br>  $200 - Entertainment (this can go down if you are conservative or up if you go out a lot, especially to bars)<br>  <br>  $1671 Per month, but there are lots variables that can bring this up or down.|`|lZVz8SwBaa	depends you could get an apartment for 200,000 all the way up to 70 million.|`|Mx07dTipaa	its expensive ill tell you that. rent for even a studio is about 900+. but it also depends on what part of manhattan you live in. The Upper east side is one of the (if not most) expensive part of manhattan. and harlem is a little on the cheaper side. i honestly think you should have a one bedroom apt. in which you share the room with your friend, because 2 bedrooms will be really expensive considering you're college students (assuming your on a budget). cabs are expensive too, i suggest public transportation such as bus, subway, or bike riding (many new yorkers are starting to bike ride to work) so you'll need a metro card. food, again is expensive, dont buy your food in the "whole foods" market or the "food emporium" where everything is fresh and organic, because its really really pricey, buy groceries in the local markets around the city instead. a good job for young adults would be cafes, restaurants, or working in the many shops and boutiques in the city. good luck with everything =)|`|nXBPXVnkaa	Your question is much too vague. It would depend on WHERE in Manhattan, your income (if any), how you and your friend plan to split costs, if you're riding the subway or planning on driving, etc.<br>  <br>  The job would be dependent on what your qualifications and skills are. Waiting tables, retail, and food service seem to be popular side jobs for the college set. You'll need the money if you're planning on living in NYC. Rent, utilities, and the general cost of living is through the roof. Been there, done that while attending NYU.

FotBoLSGaa	I live in Troy, so I dunno how far away I am from you, and I took my test via Academy Driving School. Most of the teachers and instructors there are people that teach at my old high school, so I know theyre nice. Occasionally, the instructor falls asleep during the test, ive heard from many friends, so its easier to pass. But if you are really that worried, Id take lessons, and basically what it is, is a mock road test, and they tell you what you need to work on and they give you points and everything just like a real road test.<br>  hope this helps.

I think Hollywood Studios is better, we have only been to universal in orlando once and it sucked so bad we never went back|`|rSq790ksaa	They're two completely different theme parks, in different locations and owned by different companys.<br>  <br>  Hollywood Studios has thrill rides, stunt shows, themed restaurants and it's a lot of fun.<br>  <br>  Universal Studios doesn't have any thrill rides and has a bunch of shows and movie-making demonstrations.<br>  <br>  Both parks are fun.|`|f2959c3466eb9458fc5521de90e563d3aa	The Hollywood/LA one is better. They make movies in Hollywood. When you tour the lot - it is the actual Universal lot where films are shot. Florida is just a tourist attraction, recreated to be like the original. The one in Los Angeles is a tourist attraction on an actual movie studio lot. Both have rides.<br>  <br>  Edit - Does no one remember the fire at Universal studios where several attractions were burnt down? The Universal theme park is right next to the studio lot and filming happens there all the time. The tram ride takes you through the studio lot part and is part of the theme park. The town square that was destroyed was part of many movies such as back to the future and is part of the tour ride from the theme park.<br>  <br>  The one in FL is just a theme park, nothing is filmed there really.|`|UE1evlTlaa	Disney's Hollywood Studios and Universal Studios Orlando are BOTH in Florida but are TWO DIFFERENT things. I am assuming these are the ones you are referring to :)<br>  <br>  These two parks are completelllly different.<br>  <br>  Disney's Hollywood Studios is owned by Disney and is located on the Walt Disney World Resort property. It is classic old Hollywood at it's finest. This park has a ton of GREAT rides, such as the Rockin' Roller Coaster with Aerosmith, Tower of Terror, Star Tours, Toy Story Mania, and more. But, how this park REALLY shines is through its tours. They also have great dining options.<br>  <br>  Universal Studios is located on Kirkman Road in Orlando. It is owned by Universal Studios Pictures. This park is GREAT for any movie buff because you actually get to ride your favorite movie based rides, so you feel like you are right in the middle of the movie yourself. Movies like JAWS, The Mummy, Terminator, Shrek, and more come to life. It is also perfect for television junkies. There are rides and attractions based around Jimmy Neutron, the Simpsons, and more. This park is definitely known for its rides.<br>  <br>  So, it really depends what you are looking for. Personally, I LOVE Disney Hollywood Studios. It is my favorite park in Orlando. It is alot more low-key, has great shows (such as Fantasmic), great rides (such as the Rockin Roller Coaster & Toy Story Mania), great attractions (such as the NEW American Idol Experience), and more! I really love this park. It is a bit more expensive to go to Disney, but I think the extra money is worth it. Check out the links below to learn more. They have a great synopsis of each park and what they each offer.|`|fD1ZJsUaaa	Hollywood Studios is in Disney, Universal Studios is a completely different park.|`|LixYvfoTaa	I think you're talking about Hollywood Studios at Disney World and Universal Studios. Hollywood Studios is formerly MGM-Studios and is located in the Disney World resort, and Universal Studios is one of two parks located in the Universal resort area. Both are centered around the same theme--film and television production. I've been to both parks and personally find Hollywood Studios to be more fun. However, it depends on what your taste is. Universal Studios has more rides and attractions that please adults, as Hollywood Studios is very kid-friendly and, of course, centered around Disney movies. Some highlights of each park include:<br>  <br>  Universal--Mummy ride, Terminator, and Earthquake<br>  <br>  Hollywood Studios--Tower of Terror, Rockin' Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith, and Star Tours (Star Wars-themed ride. Very fun!)<br>  <br>  In my opinion, I'd say Hollywood Studios is better.|`|lpDXCQwoaa	Well Hollywood Studios is in Disney World and is tons of fun, though I have not been to Universal.
7PQLOgKNaa	I flew to canada in Jan with Aircanada. I flew from Dublin Ireland to Vancouver but flew through london heathrow. Try and fly with aircanada. They are not as good as british airways but are much cheaper. I know that flights are much cheaper if you were to extend your trip to dublin ireland. You wouldnt neccesarily have to get on the dublin flight. The only problem would b your luggage as they check it straight through. My ticket was 500 euros all inclusive. I hope this helps.|`|1bTYCUDkaa	Buy now if you see a ticket price that you are agreeing to pay.  The fares will get nothing but more expensive as your travel dates approach.  Seats will become more expensive.|`|WRNCfhn2aa	well you should buy it now cuz the closer summer gets the more expensive it is since more people are gonna decide to go on trip and the plane tickets won't be very available...if you get wat i mean|`|kUJtfmDaaa	Right after Christmas is the best time to buy tickets. So yes now.
c8b96c428b5adcbe941b94e428a6e7afaa	PC Beach is an awesome beach - the sand is so white<br>  <br>  The goal of any hotelier is FULL occupancy during Spring Break<br>  So If Trip Advisor says it's OK - go with it<br>  <br>  Sure, there may be some college kids there, but you will have a blast<br>  <br>  all the best - have a great trip
zqEBmLeuaa	That could be a pretty good price.  The only discounts I'm seeing right now are these..<br>  <br>  June 6-   $199<br>  June 13- $229<br>  June 20- $239<br>  June 27- $169<br>  <br>  Saturday nights tend to have less promotions, but $216 seems like a pretty good price for a Saturday night at Bellagio.  However, if by chance you are going on June 27 when the rate is $169, the total price with taxes would be $184.21.  Here is the link to the site where I always find the best promotion codes <a href="http://smartervegas.com/hotels/bellagio/promotionalcodes.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://smartervegas.com/hotels/bellagio/...</a><br>  They will update them as time goes, so you might want to see if the rate you got is refundable, that way if a better deal comes up, you can cancel it with no penalty. <br>  <br>  Now I know that you said you are set on Bellagio, and I can understand why you would want to stay there, definitely.  But I feel obligated to let you know that Mandalay Bay currently has rates for $109 for the first 3 Saturdays in June and $149 for the 27th.  I think this hotel is also gorgeous, and I personally would love to stay there.  But either way, Good Luck with your rates!|`|JLA2Wncfaa	Have a look here, but if this is the best rate you can get at this moment then book it, it should be refundable and if it is then if teh rate drops call the hotel and they will drop your rate, if it goes up (which it will) then of course you pay the cheaper rate you can not lose.<br>  <br>  www.vegasuncovered.wordpress.com|`|AA10240904	Sounds good but check other Strip hotels now for better deals|`|WWS3djdqaa	Depends on the day of the week. Also let us know if you only want to stay at the Bellagio.. There are some really good rates in Vegas now. <br>  If you are dead set on this then book directly with the hotel so you can change if the rate drops.
7bYaVxRLaa	Well, if you are going more for the rides i would check out universal/islands of adventures.  These to parks probably have the most rides and they are built for people a little bit older.  They are probably my favorite parks.  And, you can get a pass so you can go to both of the two parks as many times as you want and they are right next to each other =]<br>  Disney is alright but if you are going to go there make sure you go to Magic Kingdom(the best disney park).  Although, i do agree with you, most of the Disney parks are made for kids a little younger and besides Magic Kingdom, a lot of them don't have very many rides.  <br>  If you are going not to ride on the rides but more to just hang out and watch the shows i would recommend the disney parks.<br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun in orlando =]|`|fMPyLqW4aa	Universal is more for older kids and adults.|`|rSq790ksaa	Disney really doesn't have any age limit, if this is your first time, you'll enjoy any of the parks.<br>  <br>  Out of the Disney parks, you may enjoy Hollywood Studios more because they have more thrill rides. Magic Kingdom is the best Disney park overall. Universal is also great for somene your age. There other park, Islands of Adventure, has many big roller coasters too.|`|lpDXCQwoaa	Disney a little YOUNG?!!?!??!!? Haha, it's for all ages. There are four different themed parks, I'm 15 and absolutely love Disney. The hotels and locations are amazing, the service is great too! And there are lots of fun rides like the tower of terror and rock n rollercoaster which launches you 60 mph, plus hundreds more too do. I would say that's your best choice because it has everything for everyone.|`|sCnksozaaa	universal studios is the shizz   .  i love universal, but i think that any park is for you, they dont really have an age limit|`|Aw6nZ4wWaa	Universal.I love all of the thrill rides.And they are opening a new coaster this spring.I hope it's open!|`|zyUfLvF5aa	answering a few more questions would really help you choose. <br>  <br>   If you love animals, science, cultures, and more, Disney. There are lots of great thrill rides at Disney too. I don't really like Universal to much, mostly because there is nothing at all for younger people to do, along with short people like me. At Disney, you will have a great time what ever you do, and you will really feel like a kid again.<br>  <br>  If you are maybe planning to come  back to orlando sometime in the future, and want to do the park you didn't do before, go to Universal the first time. If you go to Disney and then universal, you will be very, very, very, very... dissapointed.|`|OikuTnKuaa	i have been to disney and i'm dying to again, and i'm 16..some of the new rides are really fun. there's nothin like watching the fireworks and walking down main street haha. majic kingdom is really fun, anmimal kingdom if you're interested in animals(the ride Mt. Everest is there it was great), epoct for around the world, and mgm for indiana jones tower of terror and rockin rollacoaster. i haven't really heard much about universal but i really want to go to sea world..disney also has 2 water parks|`|1YR6c4XLaa	if you love rollercoasters and crazy rides then universal is your choice. if you like the more theme and smaller rides then disney. i've been to both. and there both alot of fun. <br>  <br>  disney has alot of theme rides, and is good to see if you haven't never been. but once you have been to disney then the next time it won't be as much fun. ;p|`|nlRr07dRaa	universal/ Island of adventures is Highly recommended they have the older people  characters Like the hulk/ spider man, Also faster and enjoyable Roller coasters! fun for the whole family!!!!!|`|LRdYCjBXaa	I would defiantly recommend Universal or Busch Gardens. If you are into roller coasters, those 2 choices would be the best.
AA11493831	We have 220 and 110 volts, which is available everywhere. But just to be sure bring a plug adaptor with you or you can buy them here too, they're very cheap less than 20 pesos. Because if your plugs have circular prongs (mostly for 220 voltage), you'll need one because the plugs here in the Philippines are for flat plugs only, at least most of them are.|`|kSt1BI6vaa	We use the two flat prongs only. 220 volts.|`|0h9aD7Toaa	The receptacles will look the same as in Canada or the US, but are 240 volt, so don't just plug into it thinking if it fits it will work. like the guy said you can get the converters cheap..|`|VGMFkcziaa	We have same outlet but not a voltage.<br>  <br>  The standard voltage of electricity used by most business centers and residents in the Philippines is 220 volts AC, 60 cycles.

f9No4eRBaa	Bottom line: As of June 1, 2009, everyone from every country that comes to Canada by air, land and sea needs a passport or equivalent travel document. <br>  <br>  Before June 1, 2009, U.S. citizens do not necessarily need a passport entering Canada by land or sea, but need valid ID that proves identity and citizenship.|`|GnY2JaEeaa	You can also just get a passport card, if you're only going to go to Canada. It's cheaper than a passport ($45 instead of $100)<br>  <br>  Until June 1st, 2009, you still need a photo ID and a birth certificate or other proof of citizenship.<br>  <br>  After June 1st, you need a passport card or a passport.<br>  <br>  Right now it's true they don't check everyone for a birth certificate, but I imagine they'll be strict when the passport rules start.|`|h61UOPHMaa	Sometimes you do sometimes you don't it's dependant on the Agent on duty...sorry it's not the best answer but it's the truth.

gLnF684Xaa	The "a" in Tagalog is always pronounced the same.<br>  Assuming you can pronounce "Tagalog" correctly you should be able to say "ang" correctly.  Forget all your English rules of sounding out words.<br>  When you say the word ang it sounds a lot like the word gong or bong said w/o pronouncing the first letter of these words and putting a little more nasal emphasis into the ng part.  Get used to this sound coming through your nose.  You must master this sound or you have no hope of getting anything but snickers in response to your speaking this language.<br>  <br>  The thing about Buttsakiss' answer is, he is pronouncing the English words bang and gang the way a pinoy would pronounce them.  This is not the same way an English speaking American would pronounce them, so as examples they are worthless to you.  It like saying, "the way you pronounce ang is like saying bang without the b".  Have you ever seen anything so silly as when a pinoy teaches Tagalog?  Hoy! Cut me some slacks :-)<br>  <br>  A for the pronunciation of the word "ng" you pronounce this word halfway between the way you would pronounce the word nong and nung if you used American English pronunciation as a guid for these words.<br>  <br>  Nakalimutan ko pala magbriep!<br>  <br>  Aba! What will you do when you get to words like buntonghinininga, tagapagdinuguan or napagsusumikapan.  Good Luck|`|07TvvktDaa	The Tagalog word ang is pronounced like bang without the "b" sound or gang without the "g" sound.<br>  <br>  ng = nung (You are correct on this one). It sounds like the Tagalog ang (but you just add the "n" sound at the beginning of the word).|`|rNyBkedoaa	ng you pronounce 'nang' not nung

I can't tell you much about a country party, but something I noticed about your story was the vegetarian farm.  That's a very unlikely scenario here.  There are farmers who only grow corn, or only grow soybeans to sell to companies, but if you're talking about people who actually grow their own food and live by their own means, it's very unlikely to come across vegetarian farmers.  I'm not saying it's impossible, but if there were, certainly they'd be looked down upon by their fellow small-townsfolk.  It's just not "normal" for a farming family.  <br>  Also, out here farm kids go to public school, and home school is for very religious or fearful people (of crime).  <br>  A farm husband would be too proud of his mid-western, small town ways, and wouldn't dream of finding work in New York City.  He would certainly be lost there.  Shopping is not a big deal for farm families.  <br>  I do believe the part where they would never have been on vacation - that's likely.|`|godXpuBDaa	As to what a party is like in western Kansas, who knows?  Likely bonfire of the hillbillies. Taking some one like this idiot I met named Jake Giaimo and passing him around like a smoke in a circle. Then dumping his crying little girl **** with a multistained shirt behind a dumpster at Safeway. Kansas City Missouri is an urban city with the hood and parks and shopping of about any city in the US. Not western. More southern than anything, former slave state. State of 2 NFL & MLB teams , Nelly (getting hot in here) and Tech Nine. Ask Arizona about what the west is like.|`|CM93goxtaa	hello i have lived in ks most my life i am a soldier now so i am no longer in ks as to your question it depends on the area u can have a prty at the lake where u fish drink build a verry big fire listen to music dance or what ever floats your boat or there is parties that are all country basicly the same with out the fishing.just dancing a few good fights beer ect then there are reg dances no beer just dancing hangeing out  and of course you college parties  lot of drunk ignerants lol i am from hutchinson ks a town of atleast 5,000 i have lived on a farm aswell and when i had parties most were at the lake if not still had fire music alcohal four willers fire works bb guns just good fun doing dum stuff no one has ever been hurt to the point of hospitalization or anything but there was a few dumm things that happend hope this helps i have a lot of stories if you would like some more ideas just ask thanks|`|SYPeab1Raa	Heres how your story should go.? They grow up in small town kansas on a farm, that just grows corn,soybeans, potatoes, etc.? Then a bank swindler comes along and tricks them out fo all there land.? Being forced out of the countryside, they move to Kansas city (it would be more realistic because Kansas City is the biggest city in the mid MID west) where the husband gets a job in an office building.? (he went to collage and got a degree in accounting)? He then discovers a million dollar accounting error, and is promoted.? The family then has to move to New York.? This where you finish the story.? To make it more dramatic it would be cool, if the family was running from the Kansas City mob.? Thats typically how it works.? Everyone from the country or small towns, moves to the mid sized to large cities, and everyone from the mid sized to large cities move to the big cities.??? And there are some people that always stay in small towns.

D2GiPPjTaa	Sandro is right...GAY =P <br>  I use to live there... p.d. if you need to SAY where Menorca is then people who answer this question SHOULD know =P<br>  <br>  It is quite boring... where are you going ?? Try the Trip Advisor Website to find out somethings near your hotel...<br>  <br>  but on the whole... the middle of Summer it will be around 25oC... but WINDY... it is an island... almost anywhere you go there will be a cool breaze... not nice when you're trying to Sun bathe... it is too cold for me as a vacation spot<br>  <br>  Depending on where you go will depend what there is to do there...it's quite cheap... but the Taxis are EXPENSIVE... so get Buses (if you can... there arn't many!)<br>  <br>  If you're looking for a party... not a good place... it is for family holidays... and crazy English and Germans who are happy to sit on a cold beach =P<br>  <br>  have fun<br>  <br>  p.d. there's lot's of pre-historic runines there =) if you like thing's like this you should look... they are like mini-stone hendge<br>  (navetes, taules, and talaiots are what you'd need to look for in a guide)|`|d752626a8e04d590b5de05ddff20f574aa	I have been there twice on  holiday.  I really liked it the people were very friendly.  I visited all round the island my fave was Carla Galdana beautiful blue sea and great swimming with the fishes.|`|YQfmBvHPaa	It is a gay island.
WWS3djdqaa	Bring a swim suit in your carry on so when you get on the ship early you can use the pool. <br>  <br>  Go the Paridise island via taxi and enjoy a hassle free beach... nobody trying to sell you things. if there are some people there look at them in the eye and say no thank you and they wil leave you alone. If you show weakness they will swarm....<br>  <br>  On Coco cay make sure you are on the first transport, so you can get your choice of chairs. If you want quasi alone time walk about 1/4 mile straight through the main area and follow the shore line to the end of the beach.. there are no ammenities there but you will be somewhat alone. There are always the old people that walk that will occasionaly pass by. Put you beach chair almost in the water that way they pass behind you and not in front of you which I find annoying. However if you want to be close to the action I suggest the secong lagoon to the left.. it is close to the food and the bars.|`|XzLUA7ataa	The weather will be hot and you will want to visit the pool and the beaches.  Take and use sunscreen, and a hat with a brim to protect you from the rays. No vacation is fun with a bad sunburn.<br>  <br>   Nassau is pleasant and the local people will welcome you, especially at the straw market where there is an array of merchandise both handmade and machine made.  You can negotiate prices, and make an offer of what you'd like to pay for the merchandise.  They'll likely counter with a compromise price.  If you wish you can get your hair braided and beaded by the locals.   There are also taxi cabs available, or horse and buggy historic tour, and they offer a comfortable alternative to walking in the hot sun.<br>     CoCo Cay is owned by the cruise line.  You'll have a fun outdoor barbeque with chicken,burgers, and ribs, all kinds of salads. There is a neat water slide for slight fee.  The water is great for wading or swimming and shell collecting, too.  The beach is loaded with lounge chairs for no additional cost. It can get windy, so take a cover up shirt. Also available is a tent where you can buy souvenirs, tee shirts, towels, jewelry.  Have a great vacation!|`|XBulMn2zaa	There really isn't much to do in either place except snorkle.  Nassau has beach and casino as well as a strawmarket that has rows of vendors selling the same stuff.  Coco Cay is the cruise line's own island, so again, it is a day for beach activities, not tours.|`|CMN09kOAaa	Day 1 is the day you get on the ship so arrive as early as possible, so that you get on right away (don't go before 11am)<br>  In Nassau, book a room at Comfort Suites on Paradise Island and you get access to the Atlantis resort all day.  The waterpark area is amazing, and it is cool to just walk around there.<br>  Coco Cay - Total beach day, if you're adventourous do the wave runners.<br>  Have a great cruise :)|`|bNrrTyrQaa	Im assuming your going on Majesty of the Seas? You wil have the most amazing time of your life! Everything about royal caribbean is great, including the ships and service, Coco Cay is a great, quiet, private island, nassau is nothing special but worth a go!<br>  <br>  <br>  Have a great time
mXB6vy6xaa	Try Mainstreethomes.com<br>  They have several communities within close proximity to Kelly AFB, and they have a broad selection of plans in the $1000. per month range.

Try not to go too far east though, when you go north of Hwy 90 - because there can be a lot of crime in that area :(.  <br>  <br>  The area immediately around Kelly AFB can really be dangerous though, from one block to another, you just have to be careful. <br>  <br>  I would suggest you perhaps stay in a hotel for a couple weeks, and then really check out the area first.  Just watch the news and you'll figure out where you don't want to be.  <br>  <br>  If you'd like to check it out first, you can look on <a href="http://www.mysanantonio.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.mysanantonio.com</a> and look for news stories, or you can also go to <a href="http://www.woai.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.woai.com</a> <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Just saw the poster's info below:  My advice, stay AWAY from Lackland Heights, Heritage Oaks and Marbach Place (unless you don't mind your children being accidentally shot in broad daylight as they play outside)!

It is also needed to return across the border into the US.|`|ubo0HWtVaa	YES!!|`|TOtkwcxNaa	Just to confirm some of the answers given regarding passports and what is required for travel across the US border:<br>  <br>  Air Travel:  A valid passport<br>  <br>  Land Travel:  A valid passport; OR; government issued photo ID (i.e. Drivers License) and an official birth certificate (not a photo copy).<br>  <br>  Sea Travel:  Same as land<br>  <br>  Effective June 1, 2009 a passport, or approved alternative, will be required for all forms of travel across the US border.  Note that although these regulations will be enforced by Canada Customs they were, in fact, brought in by the US.  Approved alternatives include NEXUS Cards, Passport Cards, and possibly enhanced drivers licenses.  Only a passport or NEXUS Card are valid for air travel so I would recommend applying for a passport if you do not already have one.<br>  <br>  For your information a NEXUS Card is a special pre-approved entrance ID and can be used at specific locations only.  It is used by frequent travellers going to the US/Canada on business normally.|`|AA10248239	These days, yes, although if you live in a border city, you may be able to get across with local ID, such as a driver's license.|`|fscgp7iFaa	Ummm....YEAH! and a birth certificate.|`|Zw7IVfqeaa	If you're driving or coming in on a boat, no. If you're flying, yes. You can drive from New York into Canada with a driver's license AND a notarized birth certificate. They keep extending the deadline of the date you'll need a passport because of good border relations with Canada. <br>  <br>  The people who answered waaaay above did not do their research. The people above me are correct, the deadline is June 1, 2009. Before that you do NOT need a passport to enter Canada via land or sea.|`|SSQ05GaEaa	If you are flying into Canada then yes you do need one. If you are arriving by land or sea, before June 1, 2009, U.S. citizens crossing the border into Canada by land or sea need ID that proves two things: <br>  1) Citizenship, and 2) Identity by way of a photo. <br>  <br>  A driver's license on its own or a Social Security Card on its own are not valid ID to cross the Canadian border. <br>  <br>  The following pieces of identification will serve as satisfactory proof of U.S. citizenship to enter Canada. <br>  US passport or passport equivalent <br>  Birth certificate OR Certificate of citizenship or naturalization AND Photo ID, such as current driver's license<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Bottom line: As of June 1, 2009, everyone from every country that comes to Canada by air, land and sea needs a passport or equivalent travel document. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|ZSOxZFLbaa	Call the State Department to be sure, or check their site, but you might as well get one.

A drivers licence would do though if you have one.|`|MTF0Rz90aa	No you don't need a passport to travel within the European member states, however its advisable to carry photo ID with you.<br>  Ja.|`|3e34f165ad30f58bf7f1417310ff9c96aa	no you will not need a passport because you have already answered your own question it is part of the UK therefore considered internal domestic travel the same applies to Scotland|`|ghAToqu5aa	no|`|AA11632160	that's a strange one, I would phone the ferry Company and ask or take you passport just in case.

f5af79d31cc0946cad302ef0300bbe04aa	Hola.  Just as you said, people have been putting crazy thoughts in everyones heads.  There are no problems down here.  The drug cartel stuff is close to the border (1000 miles away) and the political unrest is in Oaxaca on the mainland.  Cabo is a resort town.  They don't want to scare away the tourists.  Believe me.  I live down here alone and have no problems.|`|siHN027laa	The drug wars are basically over the drug routes to the states. Border states and cities, therefore, get a lot of the action along with Sinaloa.<br>  Baja south is very safe. We've been there many times, rented a car and driven north to La Paz and Todas Santos, stopping at just about every small pueblo and beach village we could find.<br>  If you want, just go downtown to Squid Roe, Gigglin' Marlin or Cabo Wabo, walk along the marina, shop, enjoy.....<br>  Yes, it can be expensive but it is a vacation, isn't it?<br>  Have fun.....<br>  Main things are.....use travelers common sense.....don't leave drinks unattended, don't leave populated areas alone at night, stay with others in the area, don't flash money, jewelry around, don't drive out of town at night (we have but have done it for years).  If you do get a car, check it out thoroughly and have them mark on their inspection ticket every tiny scratch or what ever on it. Be sure they turn the pumps back to zero before they pump your gas otherwise you'll end up paying for your gas and their last customers gas, also.<br>  But YES, it's safe...  I use the same precautions I would if I go to Miami, Chicago or L.A. !!!!<br>  If it's just you two girls, I'd even take the bus to San Jose (up by the airport) and spend a day there.....great shopping, sidewalk cafes, more peaceful than Cabo and laid back.....<br>  Use your intuition, common sense and gut-feelings.....you'll be o.k.|`|AcmfbJVpaa	the Cabos is ok but don't venture out of the hotel<br>  let me tell you the Mexican Army is all over in Mexico|`|hc89tLJcaa	I just got back last night from a week long vacation in Cabo. i went by myself and had a BLAST! I went into the city every day. And, there was never a time I felt unsafe. Just use the same common sense you use when you are out and about in the U.S. and you'll be fine. Everyone was very friendly and more than happy to help with questions, directions, etc.... <br>  Just remember not to ever take the first price you are offered when buying anything. Haggle, haggle, haggle! :)|`|3UB7mSNwaa	Hey I was in Cabo 3/1-3/8 just got back last night.  You will be fine if you just follow some simple safety rules.  The beach that you are staying on is safe and it is THE place to be in Cabo if you are spring breaking.  I have been to Cabo 5 times in 15 years and there has been a lot of growth in the past 10 years.  You can swim in the ocean at your beach, there is security guards and police on the beach.  There are some great drinking hang outs right on the sand.  The rich park their yachts right in front of the hotels on that beach and party at the beach bars.  It is very high end where you will be. BUT you need to use your sixth sense and follow some rules.  <br>  <br>  1. DO NOT TRUST ANYONE.<br>  Everyone that lives there is got a job to do and that is to take as much money as they can from your pocket book.  You will be asked by everyone that you make eye contact with a question and that will lead to asking you to buy something or go somewhere to spend money.  Everybody that works at the hotels and restaurants is on some type of commission to get you to do business with them or someone else that will pay them if they stir you in their dirrection.  If you need advice talk to other guests at the hotel.  Downtown is safe to walk around and go to restaurants and clubs but beware of doormen and host/hostesses trying to talk you into eating or drinking at their place.  They offer free stuff but nothing is free in life so beware.  <br>  <br>  2. IF YOU ARE GOING TO GET F.U.B.A.R. DON'T LEAVE YOUR HOTEL.<br>  It's okay to go out and have a few drinks down the beach and have fun with all the other people your age but don't get so wasted you wind up in the wrong place with the wrong people.  If you are going to drink to get drunk do it where you are 100 percent safe so if you get sick or pass out you are in your hotel room.<br>  <br>  3. DON'T TELL ANYONE THAT YOU ARE TRAVELING ALONE.<br>  Lie and tell everyone you are traveling with your rich uncle and his friends.  Tell people he is a consultant for Hotels around the world.<br>  <br>  4. DON'T TALK TO ANYONE AT THE AIRPORT.  <br>  When you arrive you will go through Customs and then screening.  After you have been cleared you will walk through a big room with two long counters on either side of the room.  There are about 30 guys behind these counters and they will try and get you to interact with them.  THEY ARE SALESPEOPLE.  They will ask you questions like do you need a taxi or where are you staying.  IGNORE all of these people and do not talk to them.    If you need a taxi you go outside to the "OFFICIAL TAXI PEOPLE"  they drive white vans and they are dressed in white and tell them you want to pay for a shuttle to your hotel.  Don't be afraid to be stern with people, don't be a push over, it's their job to take advantage of you.  Most of the time they are only nice to you when they are trying to screw you or you are getting screwed.  When they turn off the charm the you know you are not getting taken advantage of.  They want to get the job done and go look for the next sucker.  It will be about $15.00 for each person.  You will be riding with other tourists that will be going to different hotels.  If your van is full there will be about 6 other people.  If you want your own van its about $90.00 so if you share the ride with others you will save some money and you will feel safer traveling with other Americans.  The ride to your hotel will be 45-60 minutes.  Your hotel will probably offer the same set up for your trip back to the airport so ask them about a shuttle when you are there.<br>  <br>  5. REMEMBER EVERYONE IS A BULLSHIT ARTIST.<br>  no need to go into detail there<br>  <br>  6.  Don't rent a car you dont need one.  <br>  Waste of money, just get to your resort and take taxis.  It's to dangerous to drive.  They drive like nuts there and the roads are dangerous at night.<br>  <br>  7. PAY FOR EVERYTHING WITH A CREDIT CARD OR PESOS<br>  <br>  Right now the US dollar is climbing against the Peso<br>  Good deal to go to Mexico right now.  Last year it was 1 dollar = 10 pesos.  Right now it is 1 dollar = 15 pesos and it is going up little by little each day.  What this means for you is you can spend less US dollars for more Pesos.  Yahoo has a pocket guide you can print out and bring with you in your wallet. <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/currency/converter-pocket-guide/20090309/USD/MXN">http://finance.yahoo.com/currency/conver...</a><br>  <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/currency-converter?u#from=USD;to=MXN;amt=1">http://finance.yahoo.com/currency-conver...</a><br>  <br>  Here's where it gets tricky.  The taxis are still going by 10 to one ratio so they want you to pay in US they make more money.  Pay in Pesos.  You can get Peso at the hotel desk.  They are getting 14 to 1 dollar at restaurants but I noticed some places are 12 to 1.  If you use your DEBIT or Credit cards the bank will do the converting for you so pay the bill in Pesos.  Taxis and some bars/restaurants only take cash so you will need to pay in Pesos if you want the best deal.  If you use an ATM in Mexico you will get Pesos.  <br>  <br>  There is a new mall down the road from your hotel.  All high end sto
