I had an Aprilia rs50 for a year and then moved to an Aprilia rs125 but had to sell it due to financial rubbish. Now 7 months later i need a motorbike again, but this time i am coming from a different point, before i wanted all speed/Performance, not thinking of reliability hence the rs125 which was de-restricted to 28BHP.    This time I want a 4 stroke because i plan to commute a fair way, i know being 4 stroke i will lose some power but i still want it relatively fast, above the speed limit.   So finally, what bike would be best or should i just get the rs125 again because everything else will be slower??    (say any bike, even 2 strokes)   Budget is about ￡1,100. So it won't be new.      I am riding it on my CBT license because it's already done.

20090304102838AACwXwP	Cars & Transportation;Other - Cars & Transportation	I think my fuel line is frozen. Any diagnoses?	I think the fuel line in my car may have frozen over night on Monday night. I had less than a quarter of a tank in (my fault - but I am a wimp in the winter and couldn't bring myself to go out in the single digit weather to put gas late at night when I got home from work) so I decided to do it in the morning when the sun was out and it was going to be in 21 degrees. A little warmer than the day before.      In the morning my car started fine, I drove across the street to a gas station, filled it up to half a tank, went to start it - and it wouldn't start. It tries to start, but doesn't turn over. Luckily, I was just down the road so some guys helped me push my car back to my parking lot.      Various people said frozen fuel line, so being that it's in the 30s today and supposed to be near 50 tomorrow, I was hoping it'd unthaw. My boyfriend got it to start at 9 this morning. I went down at 10, got it to start, drove it across the parking lot (I had to park in someone elses spot, so I moved it to mine), turned car off. Went to turn back on, just to be sure - and same problem as yesterday.      So I bought fuel line anti-freeze and poured it in about 2.5 hours ago, but I checked an hour ago and the car still wouldn't start. And now I'm not sure if it's a frozen fuel line at all, if I was able to get teh car start, but once I move it a short distance and turn it off - that's when it doesn't start again.      Could it be the fuel line was beginning to unfreeze, and that's how I was able to move it, but not enough to keep it going again? Or if it was a frozen fuel line, would it not be able to start and move at all?      I really dont have the money to get it towed. (I JUST got it back from the shop a week ago for new belts.)      The battery is two months old, as well as the starter. There's fresh oil in it. All my fluids are fine. Any possible diagnoses? I just want to know if it's worth it to save money and let it warm up with the weather in my parking lot, or if I should save time and energy and just get it towed now, so that I get it back sooner.

20090304111953AAqXUFa	Cars & Transportation;Motorcycles	Could this be water getting in oil?	Got a 2007 Suzuki EN125-2A, yes a grey import but based on the GSX125.  Bought a month ago.      The problem is I think water might be getting into the oil but the bike is air cooled.   The other day I checked the oil level and the oil was dark brown(through spy glass), it rained yesterday and when I checked today the oil was light brown.      This happened 2 weeks ago and thought it might have been like it when I bought it as I never checked the oil, I drained the oil and put new in, I also found like a white sludge on oil cap.  Been riding the bike since with no problems.      What made me check it today was this morning the bike started loosing power and cut out but restarted fine and been running fine.      This light brown issue suggests water mixing but how ?   This might explain why the bike cut out - as oil not being pumped around properly.      Checked for oil leaks etc - none   Checked breather pipes - no water can get in      Anyone got any ideas before I take it in under warranty so I know what i'm talking about ?

20090304144634AAgsK3k	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Help me troubleshoot my car please?	I got a code for a misfire on cylinder 3,  The car is hesitating at idle with sudden drops in rpms.             1.  I don't know what order the cylinder numbers are assigned, so can somebody explain which cylinder is cylinder number 3 counting from the drivers most side of engine, its an in-line 4 fwd configuration.      2.  How can i verify that the injector is functioning, like mechanically functioning.      3.  The car has GM's stupid ignition module, and sparks are sent through these metal terminals on the bottom of the module, which, when installed on the engine, is in between the two overhead valve covers and is inaccessible, so how do you check for spark since there are no wires?  can i check for it with the module off of the engine? is that dangerous due to the high voltage output of it?      4.  What are some other things i can probe for to try and figure what is causing the misfire on one particular cylinder.   --------------------------------------...   -The spark plugs are new and were gapped properly   -The engine in question is the GM 2.5 liter dual overhead cam  inline 4 cylinder   -There is no distributor, or spark plugs wires, but instead a unit that bolts overtop the valve covers containing everything in one solid peice, it transmits electrical energy to the spark plugs via 4 metal prongs that protrude from t underneath, when installed the metal prongs are directly overhead, and in contact with the top of the spark plugs.

20090304140622AA8Wyvo	Cars & Transportation;Safety	I stopped too close to a stopping school bus but did not pass it...?	I am a 17 year old male from New York, have never been in any sort of trouble either with the law or even with my school.  I was driving one day and I saw a bus with the yellow flashers on coming in the opposite direction.  There was on car in front of me and we both readily slowed down.  The bus just kept slowly coming toward our two cars as both my car and the one in front of me cautiously proceeded.  I knew the car in front of me was confused as well because it stopped, while the bus still had yellow flashers on, and then the car quickly sped by the bus, leaving me in the awkward situation.  The bus then stopped completely and put the red flashers and stop signs out, so I immediately came to a complete stop where I was, not wanting to go any further and risk passing the stop signs.  As I was now, admittedly, too close to the bus, the bus driver angrily motioned for me too back up, which I did.  She then proceeded to write something on a piece of paper (I'm guessing my License Plate Number) and we both traveled in opposite directions.  No police officer saw what happened, and I am not trying to get out of it or say it was not my fault, I made a mistake and did not know where the bus driver was going to stop, and therefore I traveled too far and was in a terrible location.  I am a very cautious driver, and a worrisome person, (as you can see by me writing this questions no more than two hours after the incident).  I have not been contacted by the police, but am wanting to know what sort of consequences I am facing, and believe me I know I made a mistake and should be punished, I just don't want to go to jail!  If any police officers or others with knowledge of situations such as mine could enlighten me I would really appreciate being prepared for what is coming my way.  I feel horrible that I made this mistake. Thanks...

I took it to my own mechanic after it started stalling two days after I bought it, and they told me that the computer's codes were either erased, or the computer itself was no good, therefore they couldn't tell me what was wrong with it.    I took it back to the dealership, whose nice-guy attitude had disappeared. They refused to fix it, and blamed the dead computer on my mechanic.    The car stopped stalling out a few days later, and I figure it was just bad gas. Now, a month after I bought it, The car is driving badly and stalling again.   When I accelerate, it feels like that car is about to stall, sort of jerking- like I'm lifting my foot off and pressing it down again- all while I'm traveling down the road.

I was waiting behind a pickup truck at the red light. When the light turned green, the truck came in reverse and hit my car hard with no time for me to react. Then I pulled over to the side and called the cops. I was hoping the other party would accept his mistake, but he did not accept his mistake and rather told the cop that I hit him from behind ( I came to know this a week later through insurance agent, because he and the cop were talking in spanish and I couldn't understand them). So, the cop did not give citation to me or him. Now, this guy's insurance doesn't want to cover my car because he is lying and not accepting that it was his mistake. My insurance doesn't cover my car because it is under liability. My insurane agents called all the people in my car (we were total of 5 girls in the car) and tried to contact that guy few times, but they couldn't reach him. Everybody in my car explained to the agent exactly what happened. But finally, after 3 weeks both the insurance parties closed the file.    Now my car is wreck( it would cost me around $5000 to repair) and I want to appeal in court. I am not sure how to proceed from here.    Please please advice me.

20090227072534AACyBZ4	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Corolla engine problem.Exhaust valve stuck open?	it's a 93 corolla I-4 engine and lately It's had very poor power and runs rough/sound like it's missing.      I have done following recently but nothing in time with when the problems started- Changed plugs,fuel filter,Air filter,oil.      I thought that it might be the caty converter so I left it warm up and then felt at the back of the exhaust to see if it was spewing out air too hot. The air was normal temp for a car, but I noticed that every few "putts" of my engine I would feel the exhaust suck in against my hand instead of blow out. Any ideas/how to fix?    Thanks
