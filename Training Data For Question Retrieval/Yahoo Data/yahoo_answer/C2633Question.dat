When I push the power button to get, the window to go up it will only go up an inch or two and stop and then I have to wait for about a minute and push the button again for it to go up another inch and stops.  I continue doing this until I get the window up.  This happens for the driver side and the passenger side.  I am getting afraid to use the windows at all now.  I can’t afford to take it somewhere to get it fix, so I was wondering if any one knows what I can check myself to fix this problem.  The car is a 2002 Pontiac Firebird Convertible.  Thanks, Paul

This is the second time in six months that I've had to replace my brakes, this time they were metal on metal, I just replaced them at the end of August.  The hubcaps are really dirty, could it be the brake line?  Also, my mechanic thinks that it could be because I live on top of a mountain...I don't know, I've been living here for three years and this hasn't happened before, shouldn't brakes last longer than 7000 miles?

20090130191538AAvLIUe	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	My car was impounded for 30 days and now has a lien on it...?	have you ever heard of this? My son was caught driving my car with no license so it was impounded for a mandatory 30 days. 20 or so days in while my car was sitting at their yard I get a lien notice. Well I was out of town for a week so it sat in my mailbox all that time. When I opened it it said if I intend to get my car out on the 30th day than i need to sign and send back the Declaration of Opposition so they dont issue the lean. It had to be post marked on the 10th day. When I finally got my hands on it, it was the 10th day so I went to the dmv that day since they were the lien holder to see if they can make note that I intend to get my car out.They could do nothing about it and said to mail it in asap. So I did, that day. 30th day came and I paid $1400 to get my car out. I asked the police office why they would send me a lien notice so early when I had a mandatory 30 day hold and the officer said they do it just to start the process because it can be timely. I guess some people get their cars towed and think its too much money to get out and say forget it. They have to put a lien on it in order to sell it at auction. Long story short. Today I got a letter saying that DMV is the lien holder because my letter was not post marked within the 10 day timeline. It also says i need to put a restraining order on the lien holder and serve them as soon as possible. Im confused...Whats after that? It seems illegal to issue a lien before my 30 days was up. There was nothing I could do to get it any earlier or I would have. Has this happened to anybody?? What did you do to correct it??

She says it runs, and she'll sell it to me for 150 after she replaces the battery, gets a safety check, and replaces the windshield motor. She said there are no "real" problems with it, and assures it runs, so I'm wondering... is this worth the buy? Honestly, I haven't heard of a decent running car being sold for 150 here so I just wanna jump on that opportunity, but I asked my parents for feedback, and they're assuming that there aren't any parts being made anymore for an 81 Plymouth and that it'd be likely to break down and cause me trouble, but I did a little research and saw that there are indeed some parts being made and sold, still.      I don't know anything about Plymouths, so I'm wondering if anybody could help me out with this. How could I effectively argue with my parents?

20090130180254AAIUAYD	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	What is wrong with my 2004 Chevy Cavalier?	I have a Cavalier with an automatic transmission.  When first starting the engine in the morning it idles relatively high at about 1200 rpm when it should be about 500.  When I start to drive it shifts hard from first to second shift and you can really feel it shifting. It also shifts rough from second to third but not as hard.  Once the engine warms up it idles at normal speed and does not shift hard.   I tried to check the tranny fluid but there is no dipstick to check it with.  Could it be a low level of tranny fluid causing the rough shifting or is it something to do with the high idle, like the throttle position sensor or something?

20090130185417AAQtaAB	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Is it legal to drive a rental car and NOT take insurance from renting company AND NOT have own auto insurance?	Hello,      Here's the situation:   I don't have a car and consequently don't have auto insurance.   I'm renting a car from a well-known rental company.      My question might not have much logic but here it is:   Is it LEGAL (legal = defined by the law) to drive a rental car and NOT take insurance from renting company AND NOT have own auto insurance?      I understand that in this situation, if I have an accident I won't be financially covered since I don't have any insurance.   But will I get fine by the police if they stop me driving a rental car and I don't have insurance?      Thanks,

20090130194219AAL1xuQ	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	How do I switch out the distributor rotor on an 86 toyota corolla?	I am trying to change my distributor rotor on my car. In my repair manual it says I should be able to pull it off but I can't. I have also tried twisting and pulling which one repair website suggested to do and it does not seem to be coming off. Are there any tricks that make it easy or should I just leave it to a mechanic?
20090130195858AAJRDd5	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Toyota	What would be causing my 1986 toyota corolla to be hard to start?	I have a 4 cylinder 1986 toyota corolla that is carburated. I always have to give it gas as I am turning the key to start or after it has turned over. If I don't it either doesn't catch or sputters and dies. Sometimes I can't get anything and I have to try a couple of times. It happens most when my car is warm. When I took it to a mechanic they said it is just because it needs a tune up ( spark plugs, wires, distributor cap, rotor, fuel filter, carburator cleaning and adjustments). I have changed the distributor cap and plug wires and no change. Does anybody know which one of these things it is most likely to be? I don't have a lot of money right now and would like to only pay to fix what is causing the problem. Also I have a feeling the mechanic was trying to rip me off because the old distributor cap did not seem to have anything wrong with it.

I replaced the battery just before the yearly inspection was due, so I have been driving the Suburban to allow the computer to reset.    After about 150 miles (some Hwy, some city), my OBDII reads no computer errors, BUT when I first hook up the cable, I have two flashing codes and 6 non-flashing codes:    Non-flashing: M, F, CC, C, O, and E  Flashing: EV and OH    I believe all of these should be solid, non-flashing    Does this indicate that my car will fail inspection? Will these two flashing codes turn solid eventually?    I live in North Carolina.    Thank you in advance.

But then I saw on the odometer that it has near to 220k miles on it! I looked it up all over the internet and the Vigor is supposedly a really good car that doesn't die so easily.
