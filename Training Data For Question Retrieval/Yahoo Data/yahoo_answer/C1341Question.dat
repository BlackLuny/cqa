20090205084604AApHKfQ	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	What's with this weird dream?	Well, I have many weird dreams but this one I keep thinking about. In my dream last night, it actually started off in a dream of a dream of a girl laying in my bed looking across the street through my windows. She was holding a pencil & I saw through her eyes, her opening & closing my neighbors door with it? Then she saw a one eyed girl walk up to their door. Then I dreamed that I woke up and walked  toward the window and saw a girl walk up to the neighbor house across the street. I thought she might've just been a normal girl but I was wrong & saw that as I saw her face, it was the one eyed girl. I watched as the one eyed girl searched through her pockets for the key to the house. She couldn't find it & knocked over a pot that was right next to her. Then she looked at me & cried " I can't find my keys," then again " I can't find my keys," then one last time " I CAN'T FIND MY KEYS!" Some how I had appeared in front of her and she was staring at me. I nervously said "Hey, don't worry. It's open, see?" and I opened it for her. She got happy and ran inside. Then I got bored so I went back home and got dressed in normal clothes. I decided to go out for a walk. I met up with a few of my freinds and we were all just hanging out. I don't know why but we decided to go to my school. When we walked it everying was extremely strange. It was all multicolored with different walls different color. Everything was dark and cold. We looked up and there wasn't a ceiling, just a big sky of swirling darkness. My freinds and I were right next to our locker room and we just walked around it for a while looking. Then I got bored and looked at my freind and said, "Hey wanna go run in the gym?" and he said "sure". We just wanted to get out of that room because we had a bad feeling of that something was coming for us. So we walked in the gym and everything looked normal except all the light  were off and, you could still see though. I looked at the bleachers and saw all my freinds on our football team. I thought they all must've been there for lifting after school but wondered why they were still there the next morning. I started feeling glad I had an doctors appointment & missed the previous day of lifting. Everyone on the team got up and started walking towards me but they had an evil look in their eyes. So we ran back into the locker room and our freinds got freaked out and asked what was going on and then saw everyone. We started running away just running around the school. Then I woke up. I have no I dea what this dream was about, it was dark, creepy, but I still wish that I could've seen the rest of it.
20090205084459AAP7nh8	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Is anybody good with dream interpretation? cause i need a good explanation?	Sunday, my bestfriend and i stopped being friends and this time its for good, cause she always puts me down emotionally, she got new friends ditched me and etc... and  she was pretty much a bad friend.    Lately i everyday i keep having dreams, and shes always in it, in my dream we are always having a good time, like how we use to.    Today i had a dream i went on a cruise ship, and i made a guy friend, and i made a couple of new female friends, and the new friends i made didn't have a room, so i invited them to come into my room and told them we could share till they find a room. we were all sitting there having a good time, laughing and just being friendly, i felt popular and felt everyone liked me, and i was smiling and just feeling happy, but then there was one girl in my dream who didn't look like my friend, and when she started talking she had my friends voice, and she was describing my personality to everyone in the room, and for some reason i got mad and just woke up, i woke up pretty mad....why is that (yea the dream sounds stupid but i wana know why i keep dreaming of her everyday)

20090205085216AAKhqrI	Social Science;Economics	How much influence does OPEC have on our economy?	I know several domestic factors contributed to our economic downfall. OPEC had to raise their prices since oil is priced in US dollars. Higher gas prices obviously go up over here and hurt us.      Here's what I'm getting at:      I've noticed gas prices going up again. We're trying to pass a stimulus package (separate issue altogether) to get people back to work. Let's say we do get people back to work, then gas prices go up again. Isn't that kinda like OPEC stepping on our throats?      OPEC's collection of nations contain more than a few that are hostile to US interests. Do they smell blood in the water? Do they want to kick the superpower while it's down? Leverage oil prices/output to maybe get the US out of their land, or withdraw support for Israel?      Maybe that last one was a stretch, but I do think that this could be a problem in the near future.      Any thoughts?

Seems pretty clear that private individuals can't be trusted with that much power. What can we do to encourage our governments to adopt nationalised oil and banking industries? Seems we can't do much. But I feel so strongly that I want nothing more to do with the western world. Seems even China is moving from socialist to capitalist. So where can I go?
20090205092613AAAhamg	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Why was she staring @ me like that?	I work @ Dillards in the fragrance department.  When I was working on Tuesday, there was a woman sitting on a bench.  The bench is facing the entrance into Dillards, and the fragrance department is right @ the entrance.  Anyway...while she was sitting on the bench, she kept staring @ me. What makes this even more strange is when i noticed she was staring @ me, she kept staring and didn't look away.  So, I just went and stood behind my counter so that she couldn't stare @ me.  But, she got up and came 2 where I was and asked where the restroom was and I told her.  I was working with a customer when she came back from the restroom and I saw her past by and she looked @ me again!  It felt so weird.  What was the deal with that woman?

20090205092346AAQjt1m	Social Science;Other - Social Science	Do you agree with the following article?	I saw the programme on it this morning and the woman who wrote the report believed that single parents should not go to work because they should be stay at home with their kids rather than sending them to childcare. She also believed in 3 years unpaid compulsory maternity leave after the birth of a child. Also that parents should stay together no matter what and that single parent families are ruining childrens lives and chance of happiness. The article does not give much information but the debate on tv did. Ive summarised as much as i remembered. Any questions, just ask.

I really need to get the bottom of this question for a lot of reasons, it that has been troubling me for a while now. What makes girls aspire to be the prettiest, the coolest, part of the top girls in school? Why do girls (even the ones who don't try or seem like they care) still have a desire to be popular and well liked? I was this way in high school and I still can't figure out why I couldn't have been smarter and just not worried about what others thought of me. I need in depth answers with a lot of thought. There's more than one answer I'm sure but it's tougher to answer than it sounds.  Thank you!

I could just feel this real heavy pressure on my whole body. I was laying on my back and my whole body felt pressured to my bed. I was looking up at the ceiling and everything was kind of blurry but I know I was awake because once the pressure lifted off of me I started to pray because I was so scared. I wanted to scream but I couldn't and I couldn't move for the life of me! Not even my head.. nothing! Has anyone ever heard of something like this and if so what is the explanation for it. I've actually talked to a couple people who have said this happened to them also.

20090205095545AA8H0lO	Social Science;Psychology	This is a serious question and I'd really appreciate some help?	A little background: I'm 23, I have been with 3 men sexually in my life (boyfriend from 16-18 who I never liked sex with, boyfriend on and off from 19-22 who I really enjoyed sex with and new guy I'm dating who I've been with twice).  Growing up my parents were not affectionate. I was molested one time by a friends uncle he didnt rape me but he molested me I never told my parents what happened. I don't think I am physchologically disturbed by it but I know some people may wonder if that is the root of my problems which I'll explain below (even though it was one time and I really do think I'm over it). I also had a stalker from 14-17 who I had many physical fights with and tormented my life a great deal throughout those years. He was a guy I knew for a few weeks at 14 (not sexual) who was 8 years older (22) and wouldn't leave me alone when I tried to end it.     I ended an on and off relationship of 5 years in January 2008. Since then, every guy I've met in the past year I've liked more on the phone then in person. Most guys I met never went past one or two dates. 3 guys I've met this past year I was dating for a few months (not exclusively but we hung out and talked on the phone and were getting to the point of a relationship). So I've noticed some trends. All three guys wanted to spend time with me more then I wanted to with them. For example, they'd come hang out at my house and I'd be ready for them to leave after an hour or two but they'd want to just stay, or they'd want to hang out two days in a row and I wouldnt. I also wasn't very sexually attracted to them in person like I was on the phone, and they weren't ugly and they didnt have bad hygiene or anything but I wouldnt want to be affectionate. They all commented that I seem unemotional and they all seem to think I don't like them as much as they like me, even though I did/do like them.     I don't understand why I am so stand offish to people. I really don't want to be that way. I don't think my past is the reason because I don't feel that way, but what is the problem? Why am I so detached? the weird thing is I wasn't like this with my on/off ex of 5 years. With him, I loved sex and I was very affectionate. But he was a very non emotional man as well so maybe thats why it worked with him and not these guys? Because he was not sensitive either? I notice I also get more attracted to the guys when they are not hanging all over me. I hate when they cuddle with me, I sit on a different couch then them, or keep a distance. I feel smothered when they cuddle me. If they act like they don't want me so much then I want them more. If they tell me they like me I doubt it. I feel like I don't trust anyone and I automatically assume they are bad and find flaws to make myself not like them.     Whats my problem? How do I get over all this? I can't afford a counselor. Thank you for reading this, sorry its so long.

Si rimane così traumatizzati che una persona arriva ad odiare se stessa ed il proprio corpo. Molte donne si colpevolizzano anche! E quando la violenza avviene nella propria famiglia? Pensate ad una bimba che viene violentata tra le mura di casa... E' scioccante! Si! Ma ciò che è ancora peggio è che la persona che ti uccide (perchè secondo me se strupri una persona le uccidi l'anima) è comunque la personache ti ha messo al mondo, la persona che ti da un tetto su cui vivere, la persona che si prende cura di te...E' tutto questo fa ancora più male!   Scusate lo sfogo scritto male ma ogni giorno si sente di tutto e non si può stare zitti!!!

20081025080928AAQPYTA	Social Science;Psychology	Stress/depression/self harm?	I don't really know how to start this, but at the moment I've been feeling really low and stressed. The stress is my own fault, because I let the work keep piling up. That's because I can't concentrate in class and every time I sit down to do something I think 'whats the point?'. I have no idea why this has happenned and so suddenly. I feel like nearly everyone is better than me, even though last year I got an award for being the most academic girl in my whole year. I understand the teachers at my school, but I still feel like yelling at them everytime they say something like 'you're such a clever girl' or 'you're so organised, why haven't you done this, why haven't you done that?'. I feel like chucking aomthing at them and yelling 'I HAVE LIKE A MILLION OTHER THINGS TO DO!'. I know that's an exaggeration, but I have made a list and I litterally do have about 50 pieces of homework to do, including 10 essays. There are times in class where for no reason I go all panicy and I have to concentrate really hard on my breathing and I dig my nails into my skin.       I read this thing about teen depression and it sounds a lot like me - a change in sleeping rountine, feeling low lots of the time, feeling tearful for no apparent reason, having thoughts about running away, self harming.       A lot of this is to do with school, but it's no better when I get home, perhaps it's worse. My family love me, but every time I'm with them I get really irritated really easily and then I just go up to my bedroom and sit there, looking at how messy my room is and thinking how I can't be bothered to tidy it and feeling guilty about all the things I should be doing. Then no matter how hard I try I nearly always end up cutting myself.       Lately, I've been doing some really stupid things like climbing onto the roof of my three storey house. If anyone saw me up there they would think I was suicidal, but I'm not. I'm scared of death. I just like it. I like really stupid things, like when I'm in class watching everybody else, heads down and concentrating and then watching people on the streets walking by, thinking what's really going on inside their heads? Because I'm a good actor and I smile, get on with my friends and pretend to do work. I class I just copy down some notes and present my work well to look like I'm actually doing something.       My head is so mixed up and I don't even know why I'm writing this, because I know what the answers to this are gonna be. I know my thoughts and feelings are as importants as anybody elses. I know I should talk to someone in my school. I know i I shouldn't self harm. I know I shouldn't do things like going onto my roof. I know I shouldn't run away, because it's dangerous. I KNOW. I JUST CAN'T.       sorry,    nat, 14

I am not trying to be mean just state facts and get the rational behind this, I broke up w/ my fiance, which was a big mistake he has started "dating" this girl who is overweight, works at a disgusting bar, and isn't particuarly pretty and also drinks. This is not his type whatsoever, he has always his entire life dated normal-thin type girls, who are well groomed and attractive. I am not saying there is anything wrong w/ bigger girls, but he has always not found them attractive and said negative things about them. Also the extent of their "relationship" apparently is him going out to this bar while she bartends and I am assuming getting free drinks. Meanwhile he tells me that he still is in love w/ me, although we are not back together, and that he is very "confused" as to what to do.  He is going out almost every night of the week though, which he never used to do either, he would go out on Friday or Saturday night, almost never both nights, now he is out thru the week and on the weekends at this bar.

Girls who were abused as children.  Or neglected and dejected.  There   is a show on Oxygen called Bad Girls.  It is reality TV at its finest in   my book. =)  Anyway.  I am sure that there are those who think that   shows like this should be banned,  and not looked upon by kids.   It is sometimes borderline X rated if you ask me.  But it is  a house   full of women who have been forced to live together, along with their   bad attitudes.  There is fighting, drinking, fussing, arguing, sex, drugs,   alcohol, and so much more.  If you are a guy,  I highly recommend   this to you.  Oxygen Network, 9PM Eastern Time on Tuesday Nights.   Dont miss it !!  Now ladies.  Do you think that this show is an exploitation of disfunctional, brazen, bitter, angry, misguided women.   They need help bad.  And sometimes this show teached them how to   come to grips with reality.  And they learn from that experience.  However,  on the flip side of things.  Most people who watch this,   are being entertained at others expense.  Victimized women.  Who   need serious and extensive counseling.  Do you agree ?

We have class discussions in this class so whatever me and this guy talk about before class, the other guy manages to bring bring up the stuff we talked about outside of class in class discussions (video games, perfume, hair styles, physics vs math). they are totally irrelevent to the course but he manages to fit them in to discussions.

Now, why is this even an issue ('Why do ordinary respectable men..' ..?) if according to most women who answered my last question- such a high majority of women don't sweat men's desire or decisions to use prostitutes, porn, stripping..etc ?  Obviously it seems that some women consider it an issue.    Read on---     Guy, 52, lawyer     "I've been married once and I don't want to do that again. I don't want to get involved in another relationship. It would just complicate my life. This is an ideal solution. You know, males have their sexual needs and this takes care of them.   I can assure you this is a damn sight cheaper than wining and dining a woman, like men usually do. I would have to spend hours on all the bullshit you have to talk. This is good value.

20090205112643AAyK1hi	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Can someone explain this dream to me?	We were nomads travelling from place to place on a journey trying to get somewhere and during our trip we had to jump through different hoops and accomplish different things to survive. On the last journey it was raining outside and we had to find shelter from the storm in circulur formations of rock... that were hollow on the inside. There was a hole outside the rock where rain was leaking through teh celing and I had to steal blankets from other people in order to keep warm. I went to a rich girl's house, and stole a plastic snake (that was large) a large handerkerchief, and a couple of miscellaneous items that I thought she wouldn't need. Then I left feeling safe. Sometime later, she paid me a visit, and I was very scared that she would discover that I stole her things, I tried to concel the things that I stole through my legs.. but the gap between them was too big and it was painfully obvious to everyone that I had stolen her things. I thought since it was a dream, I could use my will and my emotions to change the shape of the supernatural realm... so that she never discovers that I stole her things and I suceeded for a while. Then she left... It was as if she discovered that I stole her things, and then forgot what happened as soon as she walked out of the picture.     Background: I wanted to write a book on chrisitan theology and I asked an african man who was doing a masters in theology at a university in germany to give me some ideas for my book that i could build on, expand, elaborate and research. He said he would get back to me today... and today no e-mail.

20090205111401AAvCplm	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	What was my dream supposed to be telling me?	Hello there everyone, and thank you for taking the time to read my question.      Last night I had a dream about an injured goose. The dream started out with me and some other people (not anyone I know) and we were in a parking lot when I suddenly found a goose walking around. As soon as I noticed it, everyone seemed to notice it, and then a girl (one of the people with me) wanted to take the goose and keep it as a pet and such.       I kept trying to tell her that the goose needed to be back in the wild with its flock. But she wanted to keep the goose as a novelty or something like that. So eventually I remember that I did get my hands on the goose and I got the chance to sneak away with the goose in hand.      Next thing I remember I was trying to get to goose to fly away but every time I tried to get him up and away he simply fell on the ground and looked like he was just lifeless. Then I remember seeing a flock of geese flying around in the near distance and then if I can recall, the goose started to talk, telling me that the flock was in fact his and he needed to get back with them.      So I kept trying to get him to fly but he still kept dropping to the ground, looking exhausted and hopeless.      One time he did get up and started to fly but it was short lived and I ended up holding him again in my arms feeling very helpless and sorry for the goose. He was very sad that he could not get to his flock and it really bothered me. I remember I felt very down and morose after his failed attempt.      The flock circled about three times and then it dissapeared, leaving me very saddened and the goose who I felt so sorry for, alone together.      Thats all I can remember to be quite honest but I was wondering if anyone has an interpretation to offer me. I am interested in all opinions.      Some background on recent events in my life include; a falling out with a good friend (however I don't think this dream deals with that) and more encompassing, I have been really trying to figure out what I want to do with my life in terms of a career and such. It has been a main focus of my life now for about 2 months, doing much research and hard thinking. I still live at home with my parents and I am 19 years old, a sophomore in college, and I havent really been on my own much throughout my life. (Besides one semester away at Sonoma State University)      My interpretation was that the goose probably symbolizes me and the flock could be possible careers or just the next step in life or such. And, although I was yearning to be with the flock, I was not ready yet or able to leave. So maybe its a hint to try and really go after a career and get out there on my own?      Sorry for making this so long, but its an open forum. Any thoughts would be much appreciated!      Thanks again for your time everyone.

They began to not value their morals and principles and even attack their own leaders, leading to assassination plots revenge, hating each other and races.      Sounds like today huh?  We are so numb to morality it's incredible.  We have next to no respect for one another, unless its a close friend or family member.  We violate almost every moral law that we have ever even thought into existence.      Are we doomed as the Romans were?

20090205101528AAp2gd5	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Is there a reason my dreams are really happening?	i need to know what is happening to me as i am scared to dream. the first dream i had was when my gran was in hospital very ill. i dreamed that there was a doctor at the end of her bed and i asked him if she was going to make it. he replyed yes. next day my mum phoned me to say we all needed to go and see her as she didnt have long left. i thought back to the dream and told them it was ok she would be fine. when we were there for over an hour a doctor came to speak to us and told us she was recovering and would be fine,. that was 3 year ago and she is stilll here.      the second was a few month after my grandad died. i lost my job and was struggling to keep up payments on my house. i had a dream that a man was in my room, he was height and build of my grandad. he told me i had to play the lottery and put on 3 tickets. i gave up playing as i had never won a thing in 4 year. i woke the next morning and i had to get to a shop to buy these tickets. i dont know why but i felt like i was being pushed to go. i did get 3 tickets and ended up getting 4 numbers and won ￡76.      the last dream was only a few weeks ago and has broken my heart. i dreamt that we were on the motorway and we took our cat with us. we got caught in traffic and the cat jumped out the window and was ran over.   on monday our cat went out as normal but didnt come home which was very unlike him as it was snowing and he hated getting wet. i shouted on him for hours but had no luck. i knew something was wrong as he hardly ever went out the back garden. a few hours later i found him lying at the side of the main road 10 mins walk from my house. i am absolutly devastated and am scared to sleep incase anything else goes wrong.       has anyone got any idea why this is happening to me?

20090205111434AAWk8ZY	Social Science;Psychology	As an undergraduate psychology student with a theory which contrasts with mainstream theory, what should I do?	The question is a little vague but i couldn't fit what I wanted with the character limit. So if you are reading this and know psychology at degree level it would be helpful. I'm in a dilemma really about sexual mate selection. I do prefer objective (peer-reviewed) research over subjective (original) research, but with my current knowledge I find I am in conflict with established, majority theories on human mate selection. I have been unable to find any study which 'supports' my view (probably because it hasn't been researched). The mainstream theories I heavily criticise for preferring 'masculine males' in human mate selection, and the evidence used is usually drawn upon comparisons with the animal kingdom (such as dominant 'apes') and poorly defined or misused used factors. I disagree with theories such as the 'sexy son hypothesis' and their conclusions because any 'advantage' is deleterious  (polygamous males are more likely to produce poor quality males as a result of harsh environments, such as stress in womb due to unfaithfulness, less attention etc) which has an impact leading to offspring producing higher risk behaviours such as drug use, drink and depression/anxiety. Whereas, 'cuter' babies receive more attention, and have better life chances (feminised-faced males perceived more trustworthy etc) because of androgynous (caring) monogamous males.      The reason why I am dismissive of such 'black and white' theories is because human nature is so complex... There are hundreds and thousands of girls who would rather prefer males with feminine characteristics (and NOT cheat with masculine men) because it shows they are open, conscientous and confident in their sexuality (there is no insecurity about 'dominating women'). Indeed, although no study to mind has looked at this phenomena, I only need to say that glam, goth, emo, visual kei (japanese rock) has alot of women lusting for men who display androgynity. I personally believe that this is because androgynous men are capable of 'peacocking', while mainstream studies have led to the conclusion that effiminate males are inconfident, I would go with the opposite and say that men who display androgynous characteristics (modern day metrosexuals) have HIGHER reproductive rates then masculine men, probably because women are more evolved then the animal kingdom and smarter at selection. It's no coincidence that countries with lower birth rates such as Britain and Japan PREFER feminine faced males when compared to third world countries (such as some African countries) where masculine characteristics are prefered due to reproductive pressures (immunity) whereas androgynous charactertistics in men are associated with socially desirable qualities, and in some way, are preferred because of 'peacocking'. While men who are effiminate are ridiculed by other men, women prefer men who 'peacock' because it shows 'confidence'.      In conclusion, I believe it is 'confidence and creativity' which females desire in offspring REGARDLESS of perceived masculinity, while confidence is associated with masculinity (tendeancy to dominate) those who are androgynous can have creativity and confidence (Ie: not conforming) which puts them at an advantage).      I don't want to sound like a crackpot, but I can't find any study which agrees with my conclusion, is it worth disagreeing with my lecturer's biased conclusion if I am tested on an end of year exam?         I can't find any study which relates
20090205112138AAWzQ93	Social Science;Psychology	What would a person 'see' if they were born, not blind, but completely without eyes?	I'm 15 and was just wondering, what would someone 'see'? I thaught this because i know that if i close my eyes, i see black, and i just presumed for a blind person it would just be black, and that in most cases is true. But what if a person had no eyes at all? Black is a shade, and is the absence of light, and white is light.. so.. i dont see how they could view any other color than them, so what would they see? Obviously nothing, but what is the nothing?? And answer, presumign that the person was born liek this, has no sense of what anything looks like on earth. because they've never seen anything.

He left behind 5 kids, a loving wife, and his 85 year old mother (who is a complete emotional wreck from this tragedy)      Since then I have had a few dreams with him in it, but one dream stood out. In my dream I was in the hospital with him and he was holding my hand and continiously saying he is sorry for the way he was leaving us all. He kept saying he was sorry for not being more careful at work, and that he loves everyone. But mostly he just said sorry a lot while we held hands crying.      When I woke up, I couldnt help but wonder if my dad is trying to talk to me through my dreams, and apoligize for the way he has left our family completely devastated. What do you think??

20090203015050AAb7nGv	Social Science;Psychology	Why is he so annoyed? is it pride?	I work with this man, we used to be good friends but feelings developed and our friendship got awkward. Basically, I thought he was more into another woman and he did seem caught between us, so I wouldn't entertain him, despite the fact he claimed they were just friends. However, he was uncomfortable if the three of us were at a social do together, so.....Anyway, it seemed to me that when I tried to be friends with him again, he was cold. He came around then and we were getting on great, but just then, he turned cold again. So I have kept my distance, I have been polite etc, but don't go out of my way to engage him in chat etc. Thing is, THIS is pissing him off. The fact that I don't make an effort to be friends seems to be making things worse, in the sense that he now barely says hello back to me even on the odd occasions that we bump into each other during the day. I dunno, is he trying to make us more distant by doing this, or is he annoyed that I won't make an effort so is paying me back? Also, if I look well, he avoids me like the plague, makes a point of looking away or pretending that he can't see me (so I'll see him doing it, even other people have noticed this and this is a guy whose entire interaction with women is based on flirtation and compliments) BUT if I look casual, he will bouyantly say hello and it is like old times. What gives?

20090205113811AAUFq5j	Social Science;Psychology	Intimidated by women in stockings and heels?	I love women's legs and feet in nylons, wearing high heels. These are pretty common fetishes I think. I don't even like to call them that, because I don't like labels and I love everything about women- I just tend to focus on those areas more.      Anyway, when it comes to women in high heels (especially those high-heel knee-boots) and pantyhose/stockings I get sooo intimidated. I'm a pretty decent looking guy, intelligent, and I have a lot to offer. But I always feel inadequate for some reason.       I love women so much, and I want to be a part of their lives, but when I see one in high heels, walking confidently down the street I just think she will reject me or will be a b*tch. I think she will have such high expectations of me, that I have to be type-A man to be with her.       I'm just intimidated by this. I don't even know if this classifies as a question. I guess I want to see if I'm the only guy who feels this way.

20090205115242AAojCep	Social Science;Psychology	I Can't Say No to People & Am Very Avoidant & Self Sabotaging?	I seem to have a serious problem. I can't tell people no. I was never this way in the past, but lately, I can't tell anyone no. I know I just pissed off a friend of mine because I commited to doing something with her and then never called her back to tell her I couldn't go or didn't want to. I just never called her back and blew her off. I had a friend do this to me REPEATEDLY and it drove me nuts and caused us serious issues, so why I am doing the same thing now to someone else, I have no idea. But I am always too nervous to call someone back when I change my mind about plans. I have anxiety, esp. when talking to people I am not really close to yet, so I try to avoid it even though in the long run it hurts them and embarasses me even more because now I have to call her back and have an awkward embarassing discussion about how I blew her off and upset her. I will do anything to avoid letting someone know I need to change our plans, if we're not good friends, including going to bed and sleeping through it. I think I justify it by continually telling myself MAYBE I'll go, I haven't made up my mind, yet, until it becomes uncomfortably late. I still haven't called my friend back, but she left me a voice message about being upset about things. I know I need to call her, but I don't want to.      I used to be a very aggressive person- beyond assertive- yet I hated confrontation. It always made me nervous. Now it makes me nervous and embarassed in cases like this. I often needlessly caused confrontation before, despite hating it, because I'd suddenly become very angry and would be really rude to people. Yet, now I find a hard time just being assertive and telling people, "Sorry, I changed my mind about going. I just really don't feel well and I don't feel well prepared to help you with this, can you get someone else?" I also have a hard time telling my friends, "Look guys, this cig. smoking around me all the time offends me because it's laying all over my lungs and I feel like you're making me choose between you and my good health." I don't know what happened to the assertive woman I used to be.      The really messed up thing is, while I wasn't this way until sometime in my adult years, I actually lost a semi-good friend once because of something like this. I just didn't want to be honest and open with her about a prob. I had with something, so I blew her off on an important ocassion rather than telling her the situation made me very uncomfortable. Then I was so embarassed about my behavior, that I never called her to explain, and we haven't talked since. I am usually hard core fanatical about not letting friendships dissolve, and am always the person in a friendship that wants to hold on to it. But lately, that is less true also. One of my new friends has accused me of not being there for him much which is true. This is partially because I can't be honest with him, yet, about what is going on in my life, so sometimes when I blow him off, I have a good reason, but I can't share it with him, as it is too personal. This makes it seem like I simply don't care, when in fact I have a good reason, but I just feel unable to tell him what is going on in my life at this stage of our relationship.      But the truth is, I have to admit, I have not put much into the friendship. I think I am afraid being his friend will complicate my life and I want to avoid it. For years after my dad abandoned me, I also debated whether contacting him was even worth it, since I had gotten used to life without him and didn't need him to complicate my life. Although, that was partially his own fault, I think. If he'd treated me like he cared, I prob. would have been more interested in keeping him around, and even now I sometimes lament that our relationship ended. Truth is, though, I usually hang on to people very closely, and still wish my ex who has been gone for years would at least be my friend again. I even miss his family, so this behavior is conflicting with other parts of my behavior. I'm really confused.      It seems to go along with other avoidant behavior I have. I have sabatoged a job I had by sleeping in too late even when I wasn't tired. I'd just go back to bed. Also, if I overslept when I had a school project to work on, sometimes I'd say, screw it, I've waited too late now and just not even try. I also self sabotage in other ways. Twice I had a high A in a class and then never showed up to the final for no good reason. I don't know why I do this. It's really embarassing to me, it's stressful and it's ruining my life and my relationships. Can someone tell me the psychology behind someone that does this BS because I don't even understand myself.

I always seem to think way too much about stuff, and then i think about my past and what makes me who i am today, which just makes me sort of closed off from people because i know no-one could understand my past, then i feel weird cos i dont exactly know what happened, and for some reason i cant express then or WONT express them because i know people will think i'm a proper freak (if you lot dont already) and it doesnt help that i cant cry!! am i just absorbing other peoples emotions and having a bad case of apathy (if it exists) or what?? im in desperate need!! i really think i will break down!!

20090219113650AACBsGx	Social Science;Psychology	Why am i suddenly being flooded with bad memories?	there doesnt seem to be anything triggering them though. so i dont know how to stop them. like for the past few hours ive been thinking about a crash i was in. it wasnt a really bad crash, just kinda smashed into a tree lol but i  was terrified  when i realised we were guna crash in the next 5 seconds. and now those few seconds, the sheer  terror,  keep playing over and over again in my head. i dont just  keep getting any old  bad memories these days-its memories of things from years ago that id completely forgotten about.      also this is a bit weird but im like, completely opposed to any physical contact so ive never had a  boyfriend. i  cant even stand kissing but heres the mad bit- when i think about the few times i managed to kiss a guy  it  i get an awful, feeling from the memory that causes me to close my eyes and kinda scrunch my whole face up at the same time as well as clenching my fists together and trying not to scream..im not really sure why, but i think its kinda like trying to keep the thoughts out, but obviously it didnt work lol      anyone know why im suddenly remembering horrible things?   or why im trying to keep the thoughts of kissing out completely away?
20090219113715AA0kAKj	Social Science;Psychology	How does one get his confidence back?	I don't know what happened, I have gone through a lot of trauma, but it never was a big deal.  But now I'm a shy person, friends are getting the idea that I'm cold, and strangers think I'm creepy now or they think that I'm a cold human being.      When in reality; I'm not! I used to be a very open minded, kind, and outgoing guy.  But now I'm shy and not confident.  I don't believe in my self anymore!      Anyway to reverse that? How can I be confident, outgoing, and open minded again? Anything will help.  Please help!      Thanks
20090219113811AAMWEtO	Social Science;Psychology	Am i being nice or do i subconciously have another motive?	im gonna make this as short as possible. my husband (then fiance) introduced me to a female and we started becoming friends when i was away. he ended up cheating on me with her. we now all go to the same church and know the same group of people. since ive been here, shes been a social outcast because i didnt want her around me or my  husband. ive forgiven them both. i notice that she is really lonely since she isnt invited to anything. ive recently decided to invite her to social events.      i want to believe that this is the Spirit of love we are suppose to have towards all people, but for some reason, that seems also too good to be true because i would expect myself to try to make her feel as bad as possible, as would most females, but i dont want to. acutally, i am really nice to her.      could i subconciously want something else???
20090219114414AAGx9G1	Social Science;Psychology	Are you more self-conscious or other-conscious?	Watch your motives for the day. Are they generally about you (your own desires and needs) or are they about others and their needs? There are no right and wrong answers here.
20090219114803AAJwtMY	Social Science;Psychology	Am I overacting or do you sense bad vibes too?	At the university, I'm taking this business Communication class. There's like 60 people in the class. Anyways we usually have homework due every week. This guy sent at the front desk right before the teacher's table.I went up to turn in my homework, but was wondering where to put the homework cause there was 3 piles. My homework was all stapled together in one not separated like it was on the table. I make light of it by laughing saying do i separate my homework and look to this guy right in front of her desk. This guy just gave this look like what the ***, but didn't say anything. The following week I turned homework in again, but had to glance at him because he's at the front and i had to get to the back where my desk is. Anyways, he gave a coldish look this time. I don't know this guy from Adam. I'm generally a quiet, but outgoing around friends. Please be mature and give your hones perspective. Similar stories, do tell.

I mean no offense by these questions and it is pretty controvesial but:      1, would you rather be raped (no other physical injuries sustained) or murdered?      2, would you rather be raped (no other physical injuries sustained) or beaten to within an inch of your life (resulting in a prolonged period in hospital with substantial serious injuries over your entire body, after which time you make a full recovery)?      3, what is your reason for answering the way you did?      4, which sex are you?      Additional questions for this section:      Are you a psychologist or councellor?      if yes, do you treat victims of rape or assault?      these last three questions are less important but feel free to answer them.      Are you religious?      Have you ever had sex?      How old are you?      Please don't answer more than once and I realise these questions are pretty sick - i think so too but I would still appreciate any answers.

20090219121101AAwvb0v	Social Science;Psychology	I forget how I used to feel about her...?	I have a best friend who is a girl and we have been friends for 6 years. But 3 months ago, I was arrested for drug related problems and was expelled from school. I am currently staying clean and straightening out my life. We only hung out few times but still talked after all that has happened. I went through a period of time where I missed her terribly. But after I got over that, it seems like everything has changed. We talked yesterday in about two weeks and I didn't feel the same. It's as if I already forget how I used to feel about her and I feel like I don't love her anymore.
