I1w0HfQbaa	I like Bobby Chacon vs. Cornelius Boza-Edwards I and II. Those were some underrated, action packed thrilling fights. I like the first one better but the second featured Chacon knocking down Edwards in the late rounds to capture a hard fought unanimous decision victory to retain his WBC superfeatherweight title. The first fight was held on May 1981 and the second on May 1983. The first fight was stopped due to Chacon's cuts and bleeding out of his nose at the end of the thirteenth round. The rematch had so much back-and -forth drama and action: referee Richard Steele taking to Chacon to the ringside doctor in the seventh and eight rounds to have Chacon's cuts checked by the ringside doctor about whether he can go on so there was drama and intensity building up in this fight. Will the fight be stopped? Is the referee Richard Steele going to call a halt to this fight at the end of the seventh round? Will Boza-Edwards win again on a TKO stoppage like he did in the first fight? Chacon had some bad cuts and he suffered a third round knockdown but her persevered and knocked Edwards down in the final round to win a brutal, uanimous decision. It was one of the greatest fights I have ever seen in the 80's. <br>  <br>  Another action fight which should get mention is Evander Holyfield vs. Michael Dokes. This was one of Holyfield's great fights which doesn't get mentioned as often when we talk about The Real Deal's career. It had everything you would want in an action fight: Dokes busy fighting style, throwing punches in bunches, coupled with Holyfield slugging fighting style and willing to swap punches mano-y-mano and his heart and determination made it one of the memorable fights at the closing year of the 1980s, this fight was held in 1989. Each round was give-and-take: Dokes winning one round, Holyfield winning another, Dokes takes the lead in this round then midway through a round Holyfield rallies back. Dokes was finally knocked out in the tenth round after a Holyfield barrage but he showed a lot of grit in defeat. This really tested both men's courage, stamina and heart.|`|kqP7GwOcaa	Hagler vs Hearns immediately comes to mind.|`|dh48AkbCaa	hagler - hearns<br>  <br>  honourable mention to<br>  <br>  leonard - hagler<br>  j c chavez - juan laporte<br>  salvador sanchez - azumah nelson / wilfredo gomez<br>  steve cruz - barry mc guigan<br>  marlon starling - lloyd honeyghan<br>  all khaosai galaxy fights<br>  michael watson - nigel benn<br>  roberto duran vs iran barkley|`|2f0d8b0ba23a243ba5699d5b29e7002baa	leonard v duran 1|`|91nAPOLtaa	leonard vs duran

He is an accident waiting to happen, If they replace him with a better corner...and the line gets more experience working together they will be perfect (the line got better as the year went on, they had to develop chemistry after Fanaca was gone).

Our strength is to build through the draft. Always have, always will. For it tis the Steeler way.<br>  <br>  Losing Washington (no big deal). He dropped way to many balls, and I hoped that we wouldn't resign him during the season. We can draft another WR if needed. Besides, Sweed is there, and if he can learn to catch footballs too, he will be better than Washington. Good riddance, let the Cards have him.<br>  <br>  Losing McFadden. Huh, okay. He broke his arm last year. That would usually suck, but the D still played well in his absense. No loss there either.<br>  <br>  I guess Washington and McFadden didn't want more rings. Too bad, their loss.<br>  <br>  The Steelers have been so good for so long. Obviously, they know what they are doing, despite changing coaches, and going through the turmoil that they had to go through during the ownership drama. There is some damn good people in Pittsburgh's front office. They know how to get the job done. They don't need no stinkin' free agents (Tony Montanya accent). If one comes along, great; if not, no biggie. We build through the draft.|`|F0sJR0jbaa	Calm down dude your team just won its second super bowl in what? 3 seasons?

pLrTfvo9aa	No. The days when they were great in the 70's and 80's were also the days before saturation TV coverage of US basketball. The kids just migrated to that sport in droves. The cricket which relied on natural talent rather than expensive academies like Australia and England suffered as a result. The next problem is that the inter island spats seemed to increase. This was evident by the waves of sackings of coaches since the early 90's. Its hard for a coach to pick the best side when he has to tip toe around the politics of inter island cricket nations who each demand their players be represented in the West Indies. Their local comp is not much to boast of but its not a problem as many of the best players migrate to English country cricket to hone their skills anyway . But all up its difficult to see them ever returning to the glory days.|`|m29y4kCYaa	They haven't played against stronger teams like India and Australia, if they do then their ranking is going to go further down.

I've been a big fan of Triple H ever since the original D-Generation X faction back in the Attitude Era.He's one of the most talented Superstars in WWE who works an excellent style of technical powerhouse wrestling.The Game can also work exciting matches and cut entertaining promos and segments.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1t1cm_triple-h-tribute_sport" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1t1cm_...</a>|`|Pvg6djVSaa	i think it depends on who you are|`|xaSEuGBGaa	No, cuz im not gonna hate someone for entertaining me.<br>  <br>  I did think it was lame though how it all played out.....<br>  <br>  Hey im HHH and im full of rage for what happened to my woman, yeah im so mad im going to swing this sledgehammer sloooooooooow aaaaassssss helllllllllll.....<br>  <br>  I know hes not going to really brain them with it, but it could have been a little more believable I think hehe.

HHH still rocks.|`|RlZvWkSIaa	No, Orton is a punk.|`|Lv89kHKpaa	I always have hated Triple H, when he feuded with Stone Cold & The Rock.

XQoH9ZI5aa	It's digressed a little.......it was like 7 of 11 or something prior to last night. Teams get hot and cold and go through these spells....I want to see it over the long term to make a final analysis.....just take last night as an example (1 for 7 on the PP).....so prior to the game it was 65% (est) and after the game it was like 45% (guess) so about a 20% drop in one game.......if you get what I am trying to say here.<br>   That said, he has a great shot and has always been a PP specialist so it should be a better PP (just not that good). I also expect that 22% shooting % to come back down to earth....LOL<br>  <br>   Sure.....a little left in the tank. 4 games has not changed my thinking that he is overpaid and his best years are behind him.<br>  <br>   The PP improvement......I think I covered that Q.<br>  <br>   You are also right about 5-5. He is a -4. PP specialist is a good way of putting it.....a 6 Million dollar PP specialist.|`|a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	1) No, I didn't think that he had anything left.  To be honest, I didn't think he had anything left when Anaheim signed him last summer.<br>  <br>  2) Since I didn't think Schnesider had anything left...that would be a yes.  But if I sit and watch it, Schneider is far less fancy than Markov, and I think that is paying off.  Smart always wins out.|`|Icze35Nqaa	I didn't expect much either but it seems to work....for now.<br>  He's a pretty good passer and and I also think that Schneider takes a lot of heat away from Markov and Kovalev and it gives these guys a little more room on the PP.<br>  <br>  Is the Habs PP fixed? Its too early to tell.
Wv0UKUdiaa	This is probably 24th time you asked this question and once again.... EPL was dominating only last season, in 2006 and 2007 the winners were Barca and Milan.... next season CL will have Milan, Juve, Bayern and Valencia, least season EPL clubs were without competition, the proof is that Barca had one of the worst seasons in the last 10 years but they still got to the CL semifinals because they had no real opponent until semi finals..... so enjoy your five minutes of fame because things are getting back to normal when Serie A and La Liga were dominating European football for 20 years .... not just 1 season like EPL!!!!|`|WdOAxQmoaa	2005,2006,2007,2008   as been all english teams. <br>  <br>  <br>  you should of put that instead of two years!!!  use man utd fans are hoplesss!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Arsenal only scored a pen? marco...roma got bloody thumped off the park.|`|eAJUfUWjaa	Calm down Freshy its not our fault that Inter are cheating scum.<br>  <br>  Sorry Marco, I know Arsenal won by a penalty but they should have beaten Roma by more than one goal, they completely outplayed them.|`|8xPYbHAHaa	to hell with this nationalism. why can't you people admire the fact that there are great players in all leagues.|`|IJvwYe1yaa	I hope not.|`|jiFHJ6daaa	hhahahha............yes...........its liverpool this time|`|cOPCNP7Laa	Umm I don't think an English team will win it and so far Arsenal scored only on a penalty and ManU and Inter drew (tho u know I want ManU to go thru this one).

yHvh7tFlaa	1- Stays. He might do what the Isles did with Comrie last year ( NOT being a homer, just using it as an example) and sign a 1 year extension right before the trade deadline.<br>  <br>  2- Sure, but are the Pens willing to get burned again on another rental player? This would have to be a sign and trade.<br>  <br>  3- Lehtonen, Legace, Toskala, Clemmenson(did this guy just get screwed or what? I know NJ had no choice, and can bring him back after March 4th without exposing him to waivers, but still........)<br>  <br>  4- Pronger, just a feeling<br>  <br>  5- Yes, I believe someone else already stated his terms. he is a list of players with NTC's and NMC's:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nhlscap.com/no_trade.htm#list" rel="nofollow">http://www.nhlscap.com/no_trade.htm#list</a><br>  <br>  6- Yes, most of their team will be available, with the exception of their top line, and possibly Montador and Selanne<br>  <br>  7- Kaberle?  I think he stays, and Leafs wait until after the Entry Draft to move him as his NTC is void until August 15th, assuming the Leafs miss the playoffs.<br>  <br>  8- Spezza, but who can afford to take on his salary? LA might be able to afford him, but I don't think they will part with prospects, such as one of their young goalies, and picks that Ott. will surely want.<br>  <br>  TB nobody goes, though I do agree moving St.Louis would be the easier of the two.<br>  <br>  ****it's a little tough for me to see, but is that Bettman that Rude Boy is pissing on,lol?|`|lYnkvRASaa	1) Somewhere else, they know he won't re-sign with them so he will have to move.  They will probably trade him for established guys under contract more so than prospects.  maybe Kaberle wants to go play with McCabe again.<br>  <br>  2) Yes, he has an edge to his game historically that they need.  It was a Pen that hit him wasn't it, Armstrong maybe so that would not be an issue anymore<br>  <br>  3) 2 significant ones- there may be some that go back the other way but I won't count them.  Philly gets one with Maybe Biron going the other way.  Fernedez gets moved also IMO<br>  <br>  4) See question 1<br>  <br>  5) no idea<br>  <br>  6) Yes, expect them to move some UFA's for youth.  I keep hearing pronger's name, he can make a lot of teams contenders.<br>  <br>  7) Vancouver in an attempt to replace Ohlund who they will be losing as an UFA.<br>  <br>  8) St louis no, at 4M actual salary (5.25M cap hit)for the next two years he is a bargain, Tampa is probably more worried about actual dollars than cap space at this point.  Spezza is probably gone.<br>  <br>  9) Not sure we need a physical center but there are not many out there.|`|5UIsGjxCaa	1. Florida needs Bouwmeester to make the playoffs. Two home games puts bums in the seats and keeps fan loyalty. Yes he will walk after the year but the damage to fan morale that trading him will produce will kill the franchise.<br>  <br>  2. Probably a good fit but Edmonton is up against the wall and needs to make a concerted run.<br>  <br>  3. Three.<br>  <br>  4. My money is on Kovalchuk.<br>  <br>  5. No but no GM worth his salt will take that contract.<br>  <br>  6. I have them as sellers on my list. Morrison, Marchant, and maybe even Pronger are said to be available.<br>  <br>  7. Tomas will stay in Toronto. The asking him for a list is to test the market. A top four puck moving defenseman with two plus years at $4MM per is too valuable to throw away. Burkie might take two firsts plus for him.<br>  <br>  8. Don't think any GM wants to take on the load of their contracts. St. Louis is probably the only one of the five with an assumable contract. None of these guys will be moved at the deadline. The contracts are too complicated to deal.<br>  <br>  9. There is nobody out there that we want on the Leafs. Kovi maybe but I wouldn't give up a draft choice for him, and that's what Atlanta wants.<br>  <br>  EDIT########<br>  There are lots of guys out there that the Leafs could use. Just nobody available on this trading day. Kovi would cost a draft pick and more. The "more" we can spare the draft picks we ain't giving up. This is going to be a selling year for the Leafs. The UFA crop this year is not for long term building. Next year is different though. This year we will pick up some pieces and position ourselves for the long run. <br>  By the way there is only 8 years between 1967 and 1975. See you later.|`|naZQqrNeaa	1)  He will stay there....rumor has it he like Latino women, sunburns, and and the cha-chas.<br>  <br>  2) No, his hair is not shaggy enough.

I don't care where he goes....just keep him off my bench.<br>  <br>  6)  I think that Scott, not my sexy Canadian boyfriend, but Niedermayer....is totally going to be dumped. <br>  <br>  7)  Florida?<br>  <br>  8)  I hope TB cools its jets this trade deadline.

Karberle stays in TO, he has given Burke a list of teams he would approve a trade for but has publicly stated that he would like to stay and Burke has also stated that he would like to keep him because he is a good puck moving defensemen still under contract for two years at under 4.5 million.  this is not an exact quote but Burke said something like this For us to trade him the deal would absolutely have to blow us away, because if i trade him im going to spend the rest of the summer looking for a puck moving defense man".<br>  <br>  As a side note, hes a good playing partner for schenn which is also a big reason why he is going to stay in the blue and white|`|ZRJkQyKIaa	1) Bouwmeester stays in Florida<br>  2) Cole would be a good fit anywhere, Pens could use him<br>  3) 3<br>  4) Chris Pronger<br>  5) dont know<br>  6) Scott Gomez, NTC  [at the end of the each season Gomez gives the Rangers a list of 3 teams he will not accept a trade to]<br>  7) Stays in TO<br>  8) St Louis goes<br>  9) Bouwmeester, but they wont|`|QxWG5kGeaa	1.

I agree St. Louis and Spezza<br>  9. Spezza<br>  <br>  And just to let you know Kabrele's list was 10 teams all from the eastern conference and it is believed that it is the 10 teams ahead of Toronto.|`|Icze35Nqaa	1. Somewhere else<br>  2. Sure, the need help on LW<br>  3. I'm gonna go with 3 <br>  4. If giggest name = biggest salary, I'll say Ryan Smith<br>  5. YES and I read that at the end of the each season Gomez gives the Rangers a list of 3 teams he will not accept a trade to.<br>  6. YES<br>  7. Toronto, he won't wave his NTC<br>  8. I'm thinking the same, St-Louis and Spezza<br>  9. Lecavalier (Montreal)<br>  <br>  One day he wants to stay in TO and the next he makes a list a teams to be traded to, I dunno what to think anymore!! I didn't know about a list 6 teams though. If he decides to wave, Burke should pull the trigger and fast before he changes his mind...again.<br>  <br>  Yeah, I heard Lawton but I don't beleive what he's saying.<br>  But other than Vinny, I would love to see Pronger or Smith in MTL.|`|rv6zl5t3aa	1. Bouwmeester- I think he'll stay with FL. He's an unrestricted FA at the end of the season and I don't really think he'll put a team up one more notch for a playoff run, like a Pronger or Niedermayer. Teams will just try and sign him next year and not pay the rental fee.<br>  <br>  2. At this point I really don't know what the Pens need to get over the hump, besides not underachiving. Cole wouldn't hurt and could give them a decent Defensive forward. I wouldn't give up too much for him though. Maybe a 3rd or 4th rounder??<br>  <br>  3. Khabibulin, Toskala and Legace. So 3.<br>  <br>  4. Either Heatley or St Louis.<br>  <br>  5. I do not know, but I see him getting dealt to a team in the bottom half of the West, trying to make a playoff run. Like a Columbus, Minnesota, Edmonton or Anahiem. Wouldn't surprise me if Sather dealt him to Anaheim for Pronger. Why not bring in another high price D-man!! Stupid Sather.<br>  <br>  6. Only if it helps them in the long run. Other than that, they'll just keep what they got and try for the playoffs.<br>  <br>  7. If he's healthy? Maybe FL for Bouwmeester? I know I said in question 1 that he won't go anywhere, but Bouwmeester is gone at the end of the year and if Karberle is heathy he's an upgrade, not like Pronger or Niedermayer, but better if FL is serious aboot a playoff run. Don't know if Kaberle would agree to it or not? Does he have a no trade clause?<br>  <br>  8. Heatley and St. Louis<br>  <br>  9. Kovalchuk. Would love to see him in Boston, but they say they are not trading him (believe it when the trade deadline is over) and I don't see what the Bruins have that Atlanta really wants or needs or is willing to give up. I'm sure we'll just end up with Tkachuk, if the B's do anything (again, I'll beleive it when I see it).|`|a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	1)  Somewhere else.  His agent and the team stopped talking long ago<br>  <br>  2)  Definitely, he's more suited to an offensive role than the role he plays in Edmonton<br>  <br>  3)  At least 2....possibly from one conference to another  ;)<br>  <br>  4)  Next Question<br>  <br>  5)  Gomez has a limited movement clause, and it can only be exercised in the off-season.  (After the Stanley Cup is raised, Gomez is to submit 3 teams he will NOT accept a trade to, and the Rangers are free to deal him to any of the other 27 BEFORE training camp starts)<br>  <br>  6) No.  Pronger MAY be moved, but that would the only big name going anywhere from Anaheim<br>  <br>  7)  Kaberle is not going anywhere.  he doesn;t want to leave.  Burke doesn't want to trade him, even though he will bring the most.  I expect Antropov, Stempniak, Ponikarovsky, Stajan, and Kubina to have new homes soon.  Kaberle stays to provide some stabilization to the young team.  Yes, he provided a list to Burke - means nothing.<br>  <br>  8)  St. Louis has said he will not waive his NTC.  Murray said this afternoon that Spezza isn't going anywhere and that Alfredsson, Phillips, and Heatley won't be asked to waive their NTCs either.<br>  <br>  9)  I would love to see that vanRiemsdyk dude in Chicago in 3 seasons!<br>  <br>  LITY|`|frDcAqyWaa	1.

I'm feeling like four, wait... no. seven... you can never have too much goaltending.<br>  4. Bouwmeester is a pretty big name that's like eleven letters<br>  5. dunno<br>  6. Yes, they have some good young kids<br>  7.  Dunno, <br>  8. TB, god I hope not, I kinda like them. Ottawa yes, for no talent goons, might as well have the whole team that way. <br>  9. Cole for Patrice Bergeron that's what I want to see... I've heard Pronger going to Boston too and that would be good too... manny is trade bait as well... but trading Bergeron is somethign I would do as GM, he is an injury risk and kinda rattled because of his injuries, he telegraphs his shots and you never notice him for positive things...
GswnLKtQaa	it's possible, cp3, d-will & nash will battle it out for the assist leader. it depends also on how the suns perform.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	No,your not and everything it's possible and even that|`|9riyyU1gaa	You're crazy.  Had the Tyson Chandler trade gone through, then it may have been possible.  But since it didn't there is no reason to think there will be a dip in Paul's assists.  With Amare out there's no way Nash will be able to average 12+ assists the rest of the way to surpass Paul.<br>  <br>  Nash has averaged the same or fewer assists post-AS break for the past 5 years.  Hes averaging 9.2 post AS break this year, down from 9.8 pre-AS.  He would need to average 12-13/game the rest of the way to get up to 10.7.  He wont be, especially without Amare.|`|kFcdwVwdaa	there isn't enough games left. nash would have to avg at least 16 assists a game the rest of the way|`|dWX9xM0caa	its possible and ur normal lol|`|ipqH3UcWaa	sure
qDE5fS3Zaa	That is an exceptionally broad question.<br>  I've climbed a dozen routes on the Tower. I think how good a time you have is dependent to two thing. 1. The people you are climbing with. 2. The route. Now this seems a no brain-er but you can be with a good group and be on a crappy route (Tad for example) and have a horrible time. Or you can be on a great route (Soler) and be with a poor group or climber and also not have a good time. <br>  That being said the routes I have enjoyed the most are: Assembly Line 5.9, Bon Homme (Horning Variation) Stepping around the corner is wicked 5.8, Soler (one of the most popular routes on the tower) is 2  pitches of sustained 5.9 (The first is a full rope length), and Durrance 5-7 pitches of 5.7 and easier, yes it can be glacially slow with all the groups but the ledges are big and you get some great views.<br>  The only one I would personally never ever do again is TAD.<br>  Hope this helps.

53986a54fb7e28986e6d815651923852aa	I was a bit surprised. I was expecting to see John Morrison put on a great showing at the MITB and perhaps win it. Having seen Puk win last year, I was hoping to see him wrestle Chris Jericho in a great back and forth match at Wrestlemania if not Austin, with Punk representing the respectful new breed of wrestlers who stands up for legends. I would say that having Punk win last night only makes this year's MITB predictable as far as who won't be winning it, but anything can happen in WWE these days so I'll save that comment.|`|NXktxy8jaa	Yes, I Knew That CM Punk Was Going To Win All Along Because John Morrison And The Miz Are Now Feuding With Primo & Carlito On Smackdown.|`|11i3Xmb1aa	I wasn't surprised. I was actually looking forward for Punk to win. But I would've wanted Morrison to also win. And then maybe he can win the MITB at WM 25 and become world champ. Because seeing Punk win again the MITB would be like reliving WM 24's MITB Match and that won't be as interesting. But throughout the triple threat match I was for Punk.|`|UWJinEbIaa	Well it was a 2-against-1 match up so the face had to win by default.

uwx7etCXaa	I think that the reason why the trophy was named after Lombardi was because of his lifetime achievements, unlike brady that only has won a few Super Bowls.  Prior to the junction between the AFC and the NFC, the Packers had won championships under Lombardi, and then proved himself as his Packers won Super Bowl 1.  He was named Coach of the Year his first year of head coach and many other accomplishments.  I don't think there could be another Legendary coach which will replace the Lombardi Trophy's name; John Madden?  I don't think so.|`|1oj4aamaaa	Never.|`|cxMsOspSaa	Hmmm, Probably between 450-500 years.|`|lPDHMOVZaa	What do you suggest they name the trophy then? <br>  <br>  The Flamming Pansy? <br>  <br>  Should they shape it into a daisy?

xU7AaQOdaa	I believe that there are different levels within the game. At the top of the batting level, you have the true greats of the game: the two you have mentioned, plus Sir Vivian Richards, Sunil Gavaskar, Gordon  Greenidge, Greg Chappell and Sir Garfield Sobers.<br>  <br>  Below this, in the second level, you have the very good players, such as Javed Miandad, Matthew Hayden, and Martin Crowe amongst many more, and it is at this level that Ponting proudly stands.|`|fsLMFIpgaa	Yes his records say its so.|`|AA11088802	sachin is on top .. and hes on 2nd|`|bettx8AYaa	i thinking there 3 batman type like belowside - <br>  supar gret batman only two for tendolkar and breadman  .....great batman for gavisakar ,broader,wagh,richard,drawid pornting,lara like that...good batman for crow,chappal,gangoli,hadon  .there also boring batman like guch,byecot,sastri,langoor and all .|`|5GUjFJjkaa	I rate Ponting much higher than Lara or Sachin.<br>  <br>  <br>  Vote 1<br>  Ponting.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	no|`|aIhVHfMUaa	Most Definately, its just that his talent shows thru in a different way, Sachin has an near flawless technique yet is still able to innovate and improvise, Ponting scores his runs thru a less textbook technique but aggresion and power, Lara...well...thank god Lara played in an age where most of his batting was captured on video, cos i just dont think there are words in exsistence to discribe the way he batted, for want of a better word, he was brilliant<br>  <br>  but what else has to be taken into account is other aspects of there games, Lara was the best batsman i ever saw, but lacked fielding ability and didnt bowl, also had a very poor record as captain. Tendulkar was, to say the least, a very handy bowler to have in your side, but once again, wasnt an outstanding fielder and also had a poor record as captain. Ponting has played in 4 world cup finals, winning 3, 2 as captain, has an outstanding captaincy record in both forms of the game and is a brilliant fielder, and has also picked up a couple of test and ODI wickets as well<br>  <br>  Sachin and Lara are both supreme cricketers, and Ponting CERTAINLY deserves to be in that group as well|`|Zl8svqUGaa	I THINK THE QUESTION SHOULD BE OPPOSITE. U SHOULD ASK THAT LARA AND SACHIN DESERVES PLACE ALONG WITH PONTING.<br>  <br>  HE IS A GREAT BATSMAN. IF U HAVE DOUBT, THEN SEE PONTING AVERAGE WHICH IS BETTER THAN LARA AND SACHIN. HE HAS DONE A GREAT JOB FOR CONTRIBUTING THE TEAM TO WIN MATCHES. NOBODY SHOULD DOUBT HIS ABILITY. HOW PONTING HAVE PLAYED IN THE PAST, I THINK HE IS AHEAD OF LARA AND SACHIN REGARDING PERFORMANCE AND CONSISTENCY.|`|04Mvb5dmaa	No.<br>  <br>  He's not in the league of Tendulkar and Bradman.<br>  He's not in the league of Viv Richards, Brian Lara, Garry Sobers, Sunny Gavaskar either.<br>  <br>  He's a great batsman but the players mentioned above were far better|`|rjWRMDYUaa	ponting is a cheater,and he never be compared from players like sachin , steve waugh , lara..|`|AQrjyQZzaa	yes he deserves the same respect as  lara and sac(k)hin|`|lrbLe6Loaa	no he cant be considered in that league
vSuWyrFTaa	Gee Sabby, I was just wondering how the ancient romans, greeks, cavemen, and the cromagnum man ever killed themselves without a firearm.............<br>  <br>   Maybe you should put this question to those elected officials who took prayer, god, and paddles out of the classroom.......<br>  <br>  Oh and lets not forget that we can advertise for cigarettes and viagra on TV but wheres the education money for our youth to make them responsible, law abiding people with a sense of morales.......<br>  <br>   Let me know how your gun control works out when you wake up one night with someone in your house and the cops are 10 minutes away..........|`|1oj4aamaaa	It's in the Constitution: “A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.” <br>  <br>  Our laws and jail sentences should be toughened on people who own and use firearms illegally.|`|Z8UV6S3baa	So, many excellent points have been made already as to why most forms of common parlance "gun control" is a waste of time at best and damaging to the safety of society at it's worst. Further, there have been excellent points that it is a right guaranteed by the Bill of Rights for very specific purpose which is discussed both in the Declaration of Independance and the Constitution.<br>  <br>  However, I want to address a couple of very specific issues that are inherent to what you are asking.<br>  <br>  1) Let's talk for a minute about suicide. My guess is you did the Wikipedia check on gun related deaths to get your "over half of all gun related deaths are suicides". So, if you follow that link to the American Association of Suicidology you can come to the report that, according to their report, based on CDC data, there were 17,002 firearms related suicides which was 52% of the total.<br>  <br>  Based on the US Census, the estimate for the US population for 2005 was 295,560,549 people. Which means that 0.0057% of people committed suicide with a firearm in 2005.<br>  <br>  So, for those 17,002 people and their families or related, their suicide was probably a tragedy and needs it's own study, but is it in any way reasonable to establish policy for the entire US based on the activities of 5 THOUSANDSTH OF A PERCENT of the population? It doesn't matter what the issue is, firearms, fast cars or fancy drugs you cannot base policy on something like that.<br>  <br>  Further, while the AAS does not go into any depth with this, only 1 in 4 suicide attempts in successful. There is reasonable data indicating that by far unsuccessful suicide attempts are by means other than a firearm. Therefore, it lends significant credence to the idea that firearm suicides really are people who likely would suicide anyway.<br>  <br>  So, in no way can those people be viewed as representative of the "common person". Further, in fact, laws EXIST TODAY which are driven to prevent firearms from getting into the hands of people ruled as mentally unstable (Highest population risk for suicide) and criminals.<br>  <br>  2) So lets look at who the "common person" is for a moment. For one, the simple question is this - do YOU think YOU should be trusted with a firearm? Depending on the study between 25% - 40% of "common persons" legally own a firearm in the US. This is based on voluntary response data which accounts for the accuracy range. The point is, that if between a quarter and 40% of "common people" believe that they should be allowed to have firearms (and a much higher percentage in some regions such as the South East) then it would seem that gun ownership is something that enough of America believes in that it is reasonable that it should stay.<br>  <br>  3) Lets go back to the part about YOU specifically asking this question. If you believe YOU should not be allowed to own a gun, ask yourself why. Do you have suicidal tendencies? Is your moral code weak enough that given this method to commit crime you will? Are you careless enough that you don't think you could prevent injury? Do you not have the emotional control to stop yourself from escalating to a firearm if you had one? If you answered yes to any of these, then by all means YOU shouldn't have one. As it turns out I and something like 100 million other people don't have those weaknesses.<br>  <br>  4) Let's come back to the math a bit. Assume for a moment that there are 100 million gun owners in the US. Let's assume for a moment that all 17,002 suicide deaths came from that population. BUT lets assume that the remaining 15,630 deaths and 90% of the failed attempts were performed without firearms and by non firearm households. Reasonable assumptions given the data. Remember 4 attempts for every success. That means:<br>  <br>  A) Households with firearms deaths + attempts = 30,055/100,000,000 *100 = 0.03% of Firearms households will have a death or attempt.<br>  <br>  B) Households without firearms deaths + attempts = 133,110/200,000,000 *100 = 0.06%<br>  <br>  In other words, using a fairly reasonable and straightforward set of assumptions the likelihood of a suicide attempt or success is DOUBLE in a non firearm household than in one that has one. <br>  <br>  Why have I spent all this bandwidth on this? Because the shooting community is constantly getting bombarded with ignorance that has a sliver of information and a bowlfull of opinion. We are not now, and never have been the problem. No statistic, no analysis, no real study has ever come close to indicating we are the problem in any way form shape or manner.<br>  <br>  What do I think of gun laws? Most of them are political expediancies that devalue Americans, kill US jobs and attack basic freedoms. Do I think guns should be in the hands of the common person? Damn right.

There should be no need for me to register my guns when I buy them, Criminals don't register theirs. <br>  <br>     And that is the whole point on Gun Control. It is geared toward the Law Abiding Citizens and not the criminals that create all the problems, with or without gun control. Gun Control is such a liberally created thing. It is back to making themselves feel like they are doing something and they can also get all their little drones to make them think that they are changing the world for the better when in reality they are doing absolutely nothing to benefit the general public accept trying to create more people for the criminals to prey upon. Let's remember criminals are criminals for a reason.

I'm sure this is obvious though, so no disrespect.<br>  <br>  My personal opinion on suicide with guns is twofold:<br>  <br>  A) If a person really would like to commit suicide, he/she will find other ways to do so, even if they do not have a gun.<br>  B) Although I do admit that using a gun may seem like a very easy way to end your life, and that some people may not be attracted to any other slower, more painful methods; You can not take away all guns from citizens just to be sure that they won't shoot themselves with them.  This is backed by the constitution.<br>  <br>  I wish that I had kept an article I read a while back debating this very subject.  Basically, one lawyer made a point that was very clear and straightforward to me:  The state (at the point and time of this article, probably within the last year to two, again, I apologize for not being able to give specifics) Vermont, at that point, had the fewest gun control laws in all of the U.S; and what state had the least gun related deaths in the United States?  Vermont.  This point reflects my ideas on gun control pretty accurately.<br>  <br>  What the government should be focusing on is keeping weapons out of the hands of criminals.  I live in California, and a law has been recently passed that now requires a 10 day wait for any person buying a new gun.  Background checks are also required.  Although this may be a step in the right direction, there seems to be a major problem with this philosophy:  Not all criminals commit crimes with brand new guns.  It is more common that criminals use older unregistered guns to commit crimes, and it seems to me that it should be of the up-most importance to get these current weapons off of the streets, not just prevent criminals from buying new ones.<br>  <br>  Hopefully with new technology, we will be able to better monitor where all of our weapons are, and just maybe, what they are doing.  But until then, I think that it would be a hindrance to our cause if law-abiding citizens were no longer allowed to own guns and defend not only themselves, but other innocent law-abiding citizens as well.  As the saying goes, "If owning guns becomes illegal, than only the criminals will have them."|`|G2I9spZ7aa	In my opinion, have a gun it's not a bad idea.<br>  for example, in Indonesia.<br>  lots of artists there have a gun to protect themselves just in case there's a robber.<br>  but there was a case that one of the artists who has a gun misused it by shooting to the sky to avoid the crowded from his/her fans.<br>  for common people, if u r a " big " man/woman, u still have to consider to having a gun just in case something unexpected happen.|`|bgxYKsGiaa	its not the guns that kill people people kill people and the RIGHT TO KEEP AND BARE ARMS !!!  and its always gangs and crack heads that kill people its not the good ole country boys down here that live by them and more people die from car crashes and alcohol a year than shooting|`|uVPTbx9Vaa	People who have guns may commit suicide but many others who do , do it in different ways.

OOeoFvB6aa	I'm trying to picture what could go wrong that you would start a turn with a stem and then end up in the splits.  I'm going to guess that you ski with your weight really far back and you get your tail edges stuck in the snow so deep that you can't continue turning, and then gravity pulls you down, opens your tips up and into the splits?  Does that sound about right?<br>  <br>  If this is what is going on then there are a few fixes for you.  First, do what Jim says and practice skating someplace flat.  That helps with a number of things, especially feeling your weight forward, on the proper part of your ski.  You skate by walking in a duck walk (like a reverse wedge) and then rocking back and forth.  If you do this while your weight is forward you'll start to skate.  If you skate a lot to warm up you'll be in a nice forward position once you get on the hill.<br>  <br>  Once you get on the hill try this, it should help you get your edges unstuck.  While you are sliding across the hill with your skis parallel, point your downhill knee out, or down the hill, just a little.  This will flatten your downhill ski and will actually start your skis turning downhill - but without your edges stuck.  You have to be patient, it's a slow move, not a fast one, but if you really want parallel turns, this is the first step.<br>  <br>  Let's say you're going to turn right.  Turn your right knee out, or point it sort of downhill, (flattens your right ski) then put your weight on your left ski - keeping them parallel the whole time.  You'll slide into a parallel turn before you know it.  Assuming your weight is in the right place (forward).<br>  <br>  If these tips don't work, then you'll have to ski with an instructor who can watch you and see what you're doing wrong.  It's hard to change your movements and body position without feedback right on the mountain.  Have you seen yourself on videotape?  That might help you figure things out, too.  My experience is you don't look anything like you think you do!<br>  <br>  We all learn at different speeds and in different ways.  You WILL master the parallel turn. Keep at it, don't get discouraged!|`|OrG2fBbKaa	Thanks Willie, so here goes a guess about someone stuck in the stem turn and stem christie rut.  This is typical of a skier who is reluctant to trust an early weight transfer to the new outside ski.  This takes some trust and the ability to balance on the big toe edge of your ski.  Start with some skating exercises in both directions for about 1/2 hour. Focus on pushing off of the edged ski and gliding on the other ski, then rolling your knee towards your other leg and pushing off of the edge again.  When you have a reasonable skill at this, try to use a skate entry in your turn instead of a wedge or stem.  While you do the skate, move your body in the direction of your turn, this should put you ahead of your skis and on the proper edge through the turn. If this is not a solution, then take a series of lessons from a qualified professional instructor who can diagnose other possible problems. These may include boots that are not fitting properly, the need of cants, foot beds or major balance problem.   Without watching you ski it is nearly impossible to diagnose the problem 100% so I am guessing about much of the problem.  Good luck and have fun.|`|qyATAaeXaa	You've got to loosen up first. The stem christie is a very rigid turn. Bending your knees and twisting your lower body only are keys to a good parallel turn. You've also got to get on your edges more and learn how to shift your legs through the turn. <br>  <br>  Jim W or one of the other instructors who are regular answerers will give you more specific info. I'll star this so others can see it who might help with better info.|`|NjSGh9H0aa	Try jet turning. I can imagine my father spitting out an entire cup of coco when I say this, but seriosuly, jet turning. You need relatively high back boots. Only do this on a soft and shallow slope at first. It is fast, and requires a good amount of courage. To do this, you need to lean back into a quasi-sitting position as you start the turn, and you need to use your boots as lever fulcrums for your legs, so that you can apply enough power to parallel. Do not try this on moguls, or on difficult conditions. This works on steep to semi steep as well. It's kinda like wedel, only with a broader stance and more in common with base parallel. One more thing. Do not force a parallel turn by using ancle and leg muscles to force your skis into alignments. This has painful and draining results, especially on your kneebones.|`|k4UKTpedaa	Just make your turns on one (outside) ski only, lift the other one and let it float next to your turning ski. Try this for half a day or a couple of hours. Then try you parallel turns with both. Remember your turning on one ski only, the inside ski should just be floating and waiting for it's turn to turn.|`|rFQXKD64aa	As Jim W mentioned in his answer, the main problem is daring to do the moves properly... so practice is in order to work out your parallel turns! <br>  This website has a bunch of online "ski lessons" and suggests simple exercises you could try out to learn how to do parallel turns : <a href="http://www.winter-sports.com/EN/Ski_lessons/skidding.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.winter-sports.com/EN/Ski_less...</a>|`|SZq1gyNBaa	One thing that might help you learn how to parallel turn is look wear you are going.  So if you want to go left, look left.  your skis will have the natural tendency to turn towards the left.

While Little League doesnt get involved in the schooling things generally the better players tend to be good students...why you ask? Because they have the discipline to accomplish any goal put in front of them, often we find kids who do poorly in school arent "coachable" and those kids very rarely end up on All Star teams or even doing well on their team.

7Xridrxaaa	Roma's midfield is nonexistent because of their formation. That lil diamond they form in the middle of the midfield just produces so many spaces on the wings and Arsenal and Manchester United are teams that have potential on the wing. Ronaldo, Evra, Clichy, Nasri, and even Eboue was looking good because of that, but that is Roma. Juventus plays much differently and more conservative much like their Italian counterparts. We might see a lot of breakaways with Amauri and Del Piero from Juventus. If Del Piero and Amauri are having a good day then Chelsea should be wary of letting an away goal slip. Other than that Chelsea can win this cause man by man they are the better team.|`|PseiMJd2aa	they won't as Chelsea<br>  face a former manager Claudio Ranieri, have Deco and Essien,  injured - Del Piero and Trezegeut return for the italian team<br>  On the other side Chelsea are re-building a good team morale|`|A1ohtlWsaa	I agree there not as physically good and I predict a 1-0 win to chelsea|`|53RXsXPZaa	do not compare chelsea to arsenal they are nothing a like|`|op4fEbEVaa	Chelsea will destroy them|`|hVQ3phWnaa	Juve' s average age is not 30.2!!!!

3Iyu7hrcaa	Mets fan is more difficult.<br>  <br>  Highest payroll in the NL, yet nothing to show for it...two of the biggest regular season choke jobs in the last two Septembers.<br>  <br>  No titles since 1986, while even the Marlins have won twice in that time.  <br>  <br>  <br>  The Mets are basically trying to be the Yankees, just with less success.<br>  <br>  Yankees make the playoffs almost every year.  They have higher expectations, but I don't think that makes it tougher to be a fan.  Their last title was a little while ago, but not nearly as long as the Mets.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT:  Since they beat the Mets, I think.|`|fQIxah8laa	I think it's more difficult being a Mets fan because they've unfortunately failed to make the playoffs two years in a row. Hopefully all that will change this year. Sick and tired of all the haters calling them chokes.|`|ZyfYh4vdaa	A Mets fan it seems like everyone is out to get you|`|6tGYe5roaa	I think that it is more difficult being a Mets fan. There is a large majority of their fans who have never seen their team win a World Series or were too young to remember it. Also, the past two years have been very painful for them.<br>  <br>  The only thing difficult about being a Yankee fan is having to deal with the haters. And honestly I have learned to ignore them so it does not bother me anymore. Sure the Yankees have not won a World Series since 2000 but I don't think anyone can classify that as a painful drought.|`|qyqxp4abaa	Met fan.  No doubt about it.  Then again how would I know?  Never been a Yankee fan.  <br>  <br>  I was born into the NL; have a picture of my mom holding newborn me in a hospital bed wearing a Brooklyn Dodger cap.  Broke my father's heart when they left.  Casey and the Mets helped heal it.  Despite 1969, 1973, 1986 and 2000, they've broken it many times again since.|`|WaaFCtuOaa	I have no difficulty being a Yankees fan  & what, the Yankees haven't won a WS since 2000 & guess what, neither have the Braves, Cubs, Tigers, Blue Jays & about 90% of the league.|`|v4EKrWGFaa	Very easy to be a Yankee fan really. Besides the BoSox they are the biggest band wagon team in the bigs. Being a Mets fan has to be far more difficult. Being in the same town as the winning-est team in history! C'mon that has to suck. All the national media pays attention to the Yanks. The Mets are only mentioned as punch lines. Even if the Yanks fail miserably with the huge payroll they just blame their highest paid, highest profile player, then act like victims of A-rod's personal problems.|`|Q5gfCe1Qaa	Yankees Fan. They have to deal with gettin ghte "BEST" players in the game and having unlimited spending, still to be disappointed by not making the playoffs. <br>  <br>  The Mets fans are cool because they know deep down that the Yankees will only prove to disappoint and watch Pedroia absolutely take them over. <br>  <br>  GO SOX!|`|6b6ff719959d29a5aa770465d592c901aa	As far as being a fan at the stadiums - much harder to be a Yankee fan. Brought my family twice last year to see the yanks, first time I thought it bad luck. Second time we left in third inning - what a foul mouthed xxxx. Mets fans seem to want to win, but its ok if its just a fun game. Yank fans seem to think they are owed victories.|`|fbkF6Ojcaa	More painful and Difficult being a Mets fan. Choking 2 years straight. Not winning since 86 and they only won because of the redsux Bill buckner. Also the Mets payroll is big as well and the RedSUX too.<br>  <br>  Ps.. Boston sucks. Worst.City.EVER.|`|ySFQ2TDWaa	Id say Yankee fan. Im actually a Yankees fan, so I know it is. Many calls you for a bandwagon fan etc. But when Yankees play the Mets I think its harder to be a Mets fan. Just my thoughts.. haha, I like your point Red sox shine in '09 LOL =D|`|nEYVRaA3aa	Yankees because they buyout 99.9% of free agents expect to win and they don't and if you don't win you get booed so Yankee's fan Mets just have a hard time in there pin im very excited to see mets in action i say 96 games won|`|LbJqU82waa	i root for both and have no problem, loser!
HxET88bDaa	Ok, he is not a "great" yet....he has more to prove but he probably had more shots on target last night that the whole Inter team! If it weren't for your goalie you would be in trouble!! If you look again, your players were quite dirty at times, but i admit Carrick took advantage of one situation and Ronaldo at another point but let's not try to make excuses....we dominated most of the match bar about 15-20 mins.|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	Man u >> Inter<br>  Arsenal>> Roma<br>  Liverpool>> madrid<br>  Chelsea>> Juve<br>  <br>  and I hope<br>  <br>  Lyon>> BARA after two weeks<br>  <br>  Anyways don't feed yourself with false assurances Ronaldo played good.|`|7Xridrxaaa	When doesnt Ibrahimovic posture like a great player?? I am sorry but Ibra always ends up dissapearing in big games. That includes the Milan game from like 2 weeks ago even if they won.|`|MjPd9vyYaa	Well my friend....it is the Daily Mail.<br>  I mean honestly since when did the English press speak the truth?<br>  But then again all the football press is bull.|`|VpiYSQVnaa	lol..what else did u expect the english media to say??|`|wQUkZm2Oaa	Can't be worse than declaring Ibrahimovic as the best in the world, can it? <br>  <br>  It's all a game Freshy, the press are always trying to hype players up. Imo both were poor last night and at most both players are good not great. The word great just gets thrown around these days by the media.<br>  <br>  Edit: Not you dude, Mourinho said it.<br>  <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/european/championsleague/4781213/Jose-Mourinho-Manchester-United-should-fear-Zlatan-Ibrahimovic.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/footbal...</a>|`|tIBZ9Gi3aa	Ibrahimovich was vastly inferior to Ronaldo in the game.Can YOU get any more biased against Ronaldo?Ronaldo had more shots on target than the whole Inter team.|`|eAJUfUWjaa	Oh shut up, your the biased one. Bashing the EPL at every opportunity, yet not realizing how stupid you sound. AnD the Italian press are bias too, I bet they even defended Roma when they lost 7-1 at OT...ha ha.|`|JCRdicqXaa	Nothing at all to do with bias.<br>  Ronaldo played like he was meant to be there.<br>  Ibra played like he was meant to be at home watching TV.|`|WdOAxQmoaa	Ibrahimovic is over-rated simple !if inter think they have one of the best players in world then...there's sumthing wrong with football.<br>  <br>  ronaldo took your defense apart,not just with free-kicks.|`|HQKuzxulaa	That's the Daily Mail's idea of impartiality. It doesn't get any better.|`|Wv0UKUdiaa	Which game were you watching?????<br>  <br>  <br>  C.Ronaldo > Inter<br>  <br>  <br>  ... it's a disgrace!!!!|`|W9l1Y6pPaa	Haha. They're just so... One of a kind.|`|2HxRylr2aa	This is a typical statement from the English media, they always think that they are the best while we all know that there national team is getting worse year after year. Also, i remember that when Cristiano Ronalado caused Rooney to be eliminated from the World Cup 2006, all of the English media and players started talking trash about Ronaldo, but when he said that he will remain in England, they say he is a great player.|`|cOPCNP7Laa	Umm tbh that is pretty much EXACTLY what the Italian press said…. I think you're more biased than the English press on this one :P<br>  <br>  Edit: Just saw Moratti on TV talking about how Inter had a hard time stopping him... I stand by my answer above.

Italian football isn't what it was.|`|iQvkT8Doaa	How many off days for 44 years|`|El7C2JsMaa	Its funny how you're allowed an off day but if any Man Utd player under performs its because they can't turn it on against the big clubs!<br>  <br>  The real question is why can't you accept that you were outclassed by a better team?!|`|7Xridrxaaa	haha inter is merda!! i am sorry but after not getting anything out of home you guys will need something special at Old Trafford.

Although United will win at home|`|O5KOwhovaa	If you believed the ITV commentators, you'd think Man U had a divine right to win that game last night.

9074478db0544852db1911805014119aaa	I have found you can use just about any team on there and win games.  It all depends on how well you play and how well you know the team your playing with.  Most people on there do not switch teams that they play with every game.  Most have played with those particular teams for quite some time, so therefore they know the offense and defense of that particular team inside and out.|`|13c029a1fcf229bbce8ad3b12d160cf1aa	I'd say go with the Bears or falcons.  The bears if you like the close games but like defense and interceptions.  The falcons are better then in real life because vick becomes dependable and dusnt get hurt for the season.  He can also run, Dunn is a good target at rb, crumple at tight end is an unexpected target and you have jenkins at wide receiver|`|4909f6c47584b258424324ed86d8da55aa	i believe the ravens r very good on there|`|dc3dcfbcb22c5bd74d1733cec8e0325baa	miami, especially because of the hype before  this year.

aUDXJbiqaa	i think that you should have your pp slides focused on common water safety and rules that you have been taught on ever since in a swim class or so forth. tell all the rules that some one needs to know if they want to go swimming and be safe at the same time. include some images of how to do that safety or rules [if there's one on google in image search...or should do so in images section of pp program. as it would be good if you include maybe updates stats to show on how important it is for that rule of safety...and so forth. <br>  this should help.
7BHIyMFmaa	Santino = comedy gold. It's almost a shame that they don't let him actually wrestle, he's a more than competent worker. I like how he never calls Beth Phoenix by her name, he always calls her "Glamazon". You would think that if they were an item he would call her Beth, but not Santino. It's just another example of the little things he does that add up to comedy genius.|`|LhDL1RRhaa	I Totally Agree.. I Was Laughing The Whole Thing Was Hilarious..

p4bKdf2Zaa	Tate Forcier is going to be one of the best true freshmen quarterbacks anyones seen in awhile. I been reading a lot about this kid, and WOW. He has a cannon, hes the most accurate passer out of his class. He runs a 4.5 40. He has quick moves, he knows where everyone is on the field. Hes only 6'1ish and weighs 185, but he enrolled to Michigan in January. He will prob be about 200 by season. Coaches say hes been the most ready by any QB they ever seen coming out of HS.

Z8UV6S3baa	So, some variant of this question comes up fairly often. The physics of the situation are actually pretty simple. <br>  <br>  The short answer is, modern magazines are designed such that you can keep them loaded virtually indefinately from the standpoint of spring wear. You will have feeding problems from debris and such getting into the mag from prolonged carry long before you get spring wear issues.<br>  <br>  Now, how can this be? Well, all materials have what's called a stress - strain curve. It is simply a graph of stress applied going up the X axis and strain or deformation experienced going along the Y axis. Steels have a particular characteristic in these graphs in they have an elastic region and a plastic region. This means that up to a certain amount of stress/strain the steel will recover with no permanent effects (we'll discount cyclical wear effects for now as they are very, very slow to occur and the average shooter will never be cycling their mags into the 10's or hundreds of thousands of times) and then after that it will take a permanent set.<br>  <br>  Spring designers (yep, it's a real job) design springs to have a certain amount of travel while making sure none of the material in the spring experiences plastic deformation. Thus, the springs in a magazine are specifically designed to be able to take however many rounds the mag is set up for and stay within the elastic region of the curve and not have any permanent effects.<br>  <br>  So, don't worry about unloading it to save the spring. It isn't going to matter one way or another. <br>  <br>  Thinkingblade|`|kQSSz2X2aa	Constantly loading and unloading your mag will wear it out a lot faster than just keeping it loaded. Springs wear out from repeated compression and expansion, not a steady pressure. As long as your springs are still functioning there's nothing to worry about.|`|xlqeCvxnaa	Good quality magazines can be kept fully loaded for years, even decades in some cases. But if you have high capacity magazines you could load them two rounds less than they can hold to ease the tension, just to make sure.|`|bHr7nGAvaa	Actually, keeping a magazine loaded doesn't wear out the spring nearly as much as constant loading and unloading.  I wouldn't worry about it, go ahead and keep it loaded.|`|h4TxVSp3aa	The thing is fine, just do what you feal comfortable with.|`|Ekx7G30jaa	No problem carrying the 9mm.  I keep my mags loaded for long periods of time, but every so often, I will remove the shells from the magazine.  It's not good to keep constant pressure on the magazine spring.  <br>  <br>  I also have a bunch of magazines so I am swapping them out.  <br>  <br>  I have never had any problems with the hollow points getting deformed.  I carry Federal HST 124 grain +P and mine and have not had any problems.  <br>  <br>  I carry the Smith & Wesson M&P in both full and compact sizes.
LnJjS8BRaa	No, there's been a myth out there for ever that ninjutsu is so deadly that it's outlawed everywhere. The fact is you can find it in most major cities across the planet these days.<br>  <br>  Look for Bujinkan affiliated schools to maximize your chances of not getting suckered. <br>  <br>  If you have a ninjutsu school in your area check it out... but check out other martial arts available and pick the one that is taught the best. Good luck.|`|C0sT0PPyaa	come on man seriously because its called ninijitsu its mysterious and illegal? NO|`|3DnX9NmAaa	No, Ninjutsu is not illegal in any country to my knowledge. In fact, there are some very well known Bujinkan shihan that teach in the UK. Just find a Bujinkan dojo in your area and apply for admission.|`|1fac5a761af3a94ccdce3f25d3999768aa	Hi there<br>  <br>  No its not against the law. I have during my training experienced many strange things mostly the type of individual this art seems to attract but religious problems too. Our club got booted out of a training hall by the local parish church many years ago because they said it wasnt very christian? Thankfully we now operate from a privately owned dojo! :-)<br>  <br>  So the real problem is close minded people or the un informed. Many people already have a deep implanted idea of what they think this art is? The simple fact is its no different to koryu jujutsu or aikido when practiced by people who really know their taijutsu but they are in short supply outside of noda!<br>  <br>  Due to UK law getting your hands on some of the weapons is a major problem because of the offensive weapons act! Weapons like the fundo, senban, shogee, shuko and more recently the bog standard katana are all banned in the UK. You have the football hooligans to thank for that back in the1980's!<br>  <br>  Thankfully you can now buy soft foam, rubber or wooden equivalents to train with! To be honest no one really needs to have a real pair of shuko anyway! The foam ones do just fine!<br>  <br>  As for it being deadly! A knife and fork is deadly in the wrong hands?<br>  <br>  Peoples lack of knowledge regarding what this art is cause more problems than anything else! TV and the ninja nutters just make matters worse. <br>  <br>  Most of the serious practitioners no longer call it ninjutsu because they are fed up of the problems it causes. For this reason the best clubs advertise classes simply as taijutsu!<br>  <br>  Best wishes<br>  <br>  idai|`|r5AMG8g7aa	Because you Bro says, LMAO .......  No but the police might laugh if you should start running around in a ninja outfit. More likely, they would take you in for questioning. <br>  <br>  I doubt that it is illegal anywhere as long as you act responsibly.|`|Qpx6gCwFaa	No, that's a load of crap. <br>  <br>  There are plenty of Bunjikan dojos in England. <br>  <br>  But you're not allowed to assasinate anyone if that's what you mean.|`|UHTcpdkVaa	Only the flipping out and killing people part...|`|A4clgOtbaa	No martial art is illgeal however if you misuse a martial art you WILL be kicked out of your club and even possibly stopped from joining any other club it can be extremely dangerous so whatever you are tought do not i repeat do NOT misuse save it for when you can use on the mat or when someone attacks you|`|Ek0eDO00aa	No, there are several centres in the UK. I know there's one in Croydon and one in Hammersmith.<br>  <br>  All martial arts can be deadly. Some of the moves I learned in MMA could cripple if used on the street. Krav Maga does weapons training and you learn to defend at all costs.
958Zy0FFaa	Travel around Australia, then head north to Indonesia.<br>  <br>  Go to the south coast of NSW, Aus in winter it picks up the SE swells and are normally un-crowderd|`|oFiStmkGaa	Lucky you!<br>  <br>  I would head off to Indo, as long as you know how to surf decently, because if you wipe out badly there then there's a possibility of kissing your surf trip bye-bye. But reason I say Indo is because you can hire people who will take you on their big boat and take you to all the spots. Let them do the leg-work and cook your meals. Tell them what you want and I'm pretty sure you'll get cooking 6ft surf. If one bay is huge they could easily find another bay close by with smaller waves. Yes you might run into a crowd or two but some skippers know the place well enough to find uncrowded surf. Best bet is during their winter as well, April to October I think, but check surf guides to help you there.<br>  <br>  Go to England, guaranteed small surf! Also best bet is during their winter to get decent size surf.<br>  <br>  South Africa is good too during their winter too, summer is also good for some spots but not for JBay. JBay is great because if Supertubes gets too big you can always move further down the point to the spot called The Point, which if it gets to 10ft is still very chill to surf as it's quite flat, but rarely gets that size. Also, down the coast is Cape St Francis with fun beach breaks and a good point break called Seal Point. Can get crowded, but compared to international standards is not considered crowded. South Africa is very chill, but be prepared to drive a lot between breaks.<br>  <br>  Brazil is also quite decent during their winter without getting too big, but beware, it can get heavy crowded at good spots with loads of "hotshots" in the water. Mostly beach breaks though so can be fickle. The island of Florianopolis down south is fantastic, so many breaks and such a chill place, this is where they used to have the WCT event at Praia da Joaquina. And not too far away, only a short drive south of Florianopolis on the mainland is where they have the current WCT event at Praia da Vila - Imbituba. Also, Praia Fernando de Noronha is also fantastic, a jewel of an island a few hundred kilometers off the north-east coast of Brazil. This place pics up a lot of swell since its way out in the ocean and is insanely hollow even on small days. A bit like France really.<br>  <br>  Maybe even try Australia, both east and west coasts offer great surf. Probably their winter as well is best. Never been there but hear it's a great place to surf but can get heavily crowded.<br>  <br>  But if I had the cash I would go to Indo, because the chances of getting good and lots of surf are high. And if you have the spare cash, do Hawaii, or at least go watch the Pipe Masters. These are the "must doos" on every surfer's list.<br>  <br>  But don't trust me, check surfing websites, maybe try surf tours because they provide decent local knowledge of places and they do most of the leg-work for you. Unless of course you like adventure and prefer to do things oneself.|`|xo5rqZ2Caa	Victoria Area such as secret spots in torquay and east melbourne if you can find them or just take th crowed most the time theres not many people anyway.|`|jPHLqk87aa	paia bay.<br>  that's what i recommend.

Cara pariolina non so per che squadra tifi ma se sei juventina continua pure ritorneremo forti e combattivi come sempre. ci vorranno 3 o 4 anni, ma almeno dalla serie A continueremo a dare filo da torcere a quegli spioni dell'Inter che sembrano cosi' santarellini.

Non esiste la differenza tra i termini "tifoso" e "delinquente", così come non esiste la differenza tra tifoso "buono" e tifoso "cattivo", poichè potenzialmente un tifoso "buono" , se spinto da una carica emotiva importante, può diventare improvvisamente, e a volte anche inconsapevolmente,  un delinquente.<br>  <br>  5) Chi gioca al calcio in cambio di denaro è essenzialmente un uomo violento, senza scrupoli, senza un titolo di studio valido ed egocentrista, e maggiore è il guadagno, maggiore è la sua carica di violenza, di egocentrismo e di ignoranza. E' una montagna di muscoli che non ha nulla da perdere, poichè ha concentrato quel poco di cervello residuo nelle zampe inferiori.<br>  <br>  6) La maggioranza di giocatori di calcio (famosi solo apparentemente perchè assoldano i mass media per mostrarsi tali) sono persone fallite nella vita, così come lo sono i tifosi che si impersonificano in essi.<br>  <br>  7) Chi gravita nel mondo del calcio ad alti livelli è un poco di buono che si è arricchito dal nulla, e come tale resterà sempre e comunque..<br>  <br>  8) Le ricchezze dei giocatori (per quanto esorbitanti) non daranno mai un buon frutto: sono destinati lentamente a svanire perchè sono soldi rubati alla società, come i soldi derivati dal gioco d'azzardo o da pratiche illecite. Inoltre i giocatori stessi non sono neanche in grado di gestire il denaro, poichè sono tecnicamente incapaci  a causa del loro basso grado di cultura, e vengono sopraffatti dai manager senza scrupoli.<br>  <br>  9) Chi dice che esiste un calcio pulito, o ha qualche parente prossimo che guadagna con il calcio, oppure è una persona di bassa cultura.<br>  <br>  10) Il calcio non morirà mai, come la droga o le sigarette, perchè ormai troppe persone ci guadagnano, anche lo Stato che ne detiene il monopolio. Il calcio è un male necessario per la gente di poca cultura, così come il gioco d'azzardo, l'oroscopo, il lotto, i maghi e i cartomanti.|`|a255ec6d36ceb5e114a03a5769e71888aa	si sono veramente soddisfatta di stare senza calcio tutto ruota intorno ad un pallone esistono anche altri sport ma vorrei si fosse arrivati a stare senza calcio senza che NESSUNO DEBBA MORIRE è ora di dire basta al calcio e a tutto ciò che ci gira intorno|`|c9c8367270cebbcbb765497e8ad0c9a9aa	ERA  ORA    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|22329f3f46367ee9034238b563148e58aa	No, ma posso farcela: tanto siam campioni del mondo...Piuttosto, è avvilente pensare che possan succedere cose del genere, e che appunto il fatto di aver vinto il Mondiale non abbia cambiato nulla...|`|263e5cfc6a23c8dd23ebf7877c81af3baa	sigh ....... sigh... no ..... rivoglio i gol ...... sigh|`|391558a4ef51aaa1d8343816bbe9de4eaa	si ... sono tutti più tranquilli e in città c'è meno traffico ... secondo me se proseguono così in 6 mesi si disintossicano tutti anche della Simona Ventura ...<br>  Magari una partita ogni tanto ... il calcio piace anche a me ...|`|LARsfZfpaa	assolutamente no...speriamo che domenica prossima si giochi|`|Y6VUDgUyaa	mi associo a "doctor"|`|b536c8e14ed51cfe62ac9ab8ee215f46aa	io si, e molto !!!|`|c7c4513b902aa74f2d7625c8b5a92162aa	si, se devono esserci morti!!!!!<br>  preferisco un mondo senza calcio che un mondo di morti per colpa del calcio!!!!!<br>  BASTA ALLA VIOLENZA NEGLI STADI!!!!!<br>  SE AMATE VERAMENTE IL CALCIO, NON DOVETE ESSERE VIOLENTI!!!!!

YTZyM0fCaa	his average is dipping, but his other number numbers arent tat bad. 16 HR, 55 RBI, 49 runs scored, and 14 SB. beltran really never was a big batting average guy. even last year when he hit over 40 home runs and drove in 116 runs he only hit .275. i have him on my team and im holding on to him. i recommend you do also, unless you REALLY need a guy with batting average. w/e you do, dont drop him. at least trade him. good luck|`|rvvLDUp4aa	I think he is going to have a blow out second half. If he's on your team, keep holding on to him.|`|0iMYQ3STaa	He's never been an average guy, last year was an anomaly. <br>  <br>  Sorry Beltran lovers/owners, these are Beltran's true colors. Either trade him, or get used to it.|`|01153ee4a5c79fd2f89196319c887bd1aa	Beltran is an awesome player, but I was also surprised to see that his average isn't usually as high as it was last year.<br>  <br>  He was one of my three original starters, but when he started to slump, I put him on the bench for a while... I've added him back to the starting lineup, but as was indicated many of his points right now are from other stats than his battin average.<br>  <br>  At this point, i'd call him a good 4th Outfielder, yes he does really well sometimes, but if yer looken for consistantcy, right now he's struggling.

ea5d3bd72b30b35cee341b84c4025d7baa	Josh Smith is one of those rare athletic player who can be a monster playing forward. He's a typical SF (6'8) that's being force to play PF for most of the season and he doesn't dissapoint. He doesn't have that popularity because he plays for a bad team, simple as that. Yet his talent has been compare to Shawn Marion, which I think you can get J-Smith at a discount, since he is going to blossom. Not many forward can get that much block shot as Smith (207 blocks in 2006-2007 season), so he's an ideal player over Amare. If you have depth, then I suggest to go for it.|`|5e139c7a4ce33c2ed8dd82f77c83bd25aa	are you crazy lol Amare Stoudemire is so much better look at the numbers, rebounds, steals, points all which u need in fantasy.<br>  <br>  Josh Smith<br>  <br>  PPG  16.4<br>  RPG  8.6<br>  APG  3.3<br>  SPG  1.4<br>  BPG  2.9<br>  FG%  0.439<br>  FT%  0.693<br>  3P%  0.250<br>  MPG  36.8<br>  <br>  Amare<br>  <br>  PPG  20.4<br>  RPG  9.6<br>  APG  1.0<br>  SPG  0.9<br>  BPG  1.3<br>  FG%  0.575<br>  FT%  0.781<br>  3P%  0.000<br>  MPG  32.8|`|ab11c77db248f05b2e7090761918cc61aa	It really depends on your needs.  Amare won't block as many shots as Smith, but his %s will be WAY higher.  Do NOT overlook %s...many people do, but they are very important.  Smith's 14 or so shots per game will hurt your fg%...he shoots so much.  Amare's 7ft's a game...and last year he shot 78% from the line will help you (well...should help you depending on your team...if your team is already shooting over 78% from the line, he'll hurt you...but smith hurts more).  It also depends on what other centers you have.  If you only have 2 more, I would not do it.  If you have 3 more, then maybe.  It's all about need.  Smith plays the sg/sf spots so it would also depend on your needs at those positions.  Myself, I would not make that trade.  Amare and his center spot is way too valuable.  Smith's %s are hard for me to stomach and if you are going for blocks, I would look elsewhere...like at Outlaw for example.|`|RkFT7V9Baa	Good! Smith is the ONLY SG that provides massive (more blocks than 90% of centers and forwards). You can get Amare's stats somewhere esle. He is the most overlooked player
2fa0c14266b4adfa5e7018131d478e57aa	Powercleans, powercleans, powercleans. They'll give that explosive pop to flatten ballcarriers. Of course any good ball player can't neglet the bench press and squat if they want body strength. That's just the weightlifting.<br>  <br>  As for drills, the jump rope will increase foot quickness. Jumping over a cone (side to side so when you jump to the left your right foot is closest to the cone and vice versa) for 30-45 seconds at a time will give you an explosive first step. Unfortunately, speed is basically inherited, but leg strength will help you get to your top end speed quicker. So resistance running (up a hill, in soft sand such as the kind at the beach) will do that. Good luck buddy, let us know how the season went!|`|eec8931a40932c706d901901b3e77ad0aa	your school should have summer conditioning fo rfootball.. if not.. Heres what we do.<br>  We bench , squat, clean, all that for 1:30 minutes.<br>  then run the 40 yrd 8 times as fast as we can non stop just a 10 second rest to catch out breath. <br>  thats for getting faster and stronger..<br>  now to get explosive and quick. Just put lines or if u have cones put em about 20 yrds apart and go back and forth as fast as u can, around do an 8 shape around then make sure u touch the cone. Make sure you study ur plays because u need to be smart to be a LB GOOD LUCK DUDE! IM WORKIng out too for the season cant wait|`|5NvXqdcMaa	FASTER: <br>  Get a resistance band and do some side steps (step way out to get some good tension).  You will also want to do some agility drills (such as back pedal then sprint forward; shuffle to one side then to the other as fast as you can).  Also get a backpack and load some weight in it and do some short sprints.<br>  <br>  Bigger: <br>  Lift weights, pushups, crunches, pullups<br>  <br>  Stonger: <br>  See above|`|5b09f1eeb355a7dd0ff8b23e44f61062aa	up downs....jog in place really fast....someone says like "Down" and you go to the ground fast as you can...legs go down and hands and face towards ground...do that and get up as quick as you can...keep repeating these things....make sure more jogging in place quickly then going down though.....its very tiring....but helps for sure|`|hr1tHSJyaa	gain wait work out
TE6Ba7Spaa	Don't listen to that useless info above me. It sounds like he doesn't even know who Fletcher is.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't trade Jackson for anyone except for LT.(obviously) He is worth too much and with a downgrade from the RB position could hurt your team too much assuming he's your best RB. Don't trade him.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|rvvLDUp4aa	You should probably get more than that.

9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	Fielder....Delgado is struggling this year so far but even when healthy he doesnt hit for a high average. Fielder will hit as many HR and possibly get as many RBI's plus he is a legit. .300 hitter with a much higher upside than Delgado. For my money it is easily Fielder at the moment!|`|eEVSSVOtaa	Wow. Need you ask. FIELDER. He is a monster that can just rip the ball al over the place like Adam Dunn and Ryan Howard, Manny Ramirez, David Ortiz, A-Rod and Carlos Lee. He is hitting it hard and getting it done. Not to mention he's hitting .293 with 14 Long Balls, and 35 RBI. Pitchers are going to start calling him KING soon. This guy has more upside then standing at the bottom of the Grand Canyon. He is going to do this for years too as long as he stays healthy. He looks like a damn bull with a baseball bat in the batting box. If you want to talk about Brute Strength. He is it, and he is no joke. Get him, or keep him. He is Fantasy Gold.|`|MdEnr9kcaa	Prince Fielder by far, I'm trying to get fielder in my league right now.  I'm thinking of offering a solid starting pitcher for him.|`|jNDR6xzaaa	Fielder.

57497a3ba571961b43f57cbee6e33aa7aa	Ordonez is 1 of the hottest hitters in the league and should be in everyones starting line up.  Soriano is heating up big time, I live in Chicago and watch every game trust me on this.  He is hitting over .300 and already has around 15 doubles.  I would choose Beltran over Sheffield for 1 reason.  I don't like having 2 guys on the same team for off days.  Willingham is on a bad team although he has a nice stick.  Swisher is the odd man out.  Griffey is a good backup but compared to your other 3 he should only see the lineup on their off days.  You could make a huge trade with Willingham Shefield and Swisher.  How did you come across that many outfielders anyway?!|`|PkCBIrNpaa	1. start Mags and Beltran for sure<br>  2. look at who's hot amongst the other 4<br>  3. Swisher and Sheffield both have 1B eligibility I believe so you can slot them in there if you like<br>  4. if this is a public league remember you have a util spot you can put one of them in<br>  5. trade an OF for another position u need|`|944a2a3b7b6d64f8b034ce9272adc29caa	I think its a safe bet that Beltran should start, Soriano should get into a hot streak soon, hopefully, i mean hes always been pretty good you know? and I want to go wioth either ordonez or sheffield.  I think you should keep both and start trading away the 3.<br>  <br>  goodluck with your team.

Furthermore, obviously they would have to give the better seeds better odds ... that just doesn't happen in real life ... there are never 4 #1 seeds in the final four, and a 12 seed has beaten a 5 seed the last seven years (or something like that).  Anyway, you can do some research on the teams if you want and/or listen to radio talk shows or watch ESPN, however no one is going to give you a complete bracket that is guaranteed to have exact odds ... the ESPN analysts don't even win their pools all the time (ex: Tony from PTI said today that he has never won).|`|0e292e1d3111ae9afaf7103682329c09aa	Here man, i think this is what you want<br>  <br>  <a href="http://teamrankings.com/ncbt/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://teamrankings.com/ncbt/index.php</a>

Do some uphill as well.|`|gefJwsosaa	i think so......... you need to exercise so that you will not get tired easily when running|`|AA11903783	Yes, of course. Your legs are what you need for running and a weak leg will not get you far. Don't do it abruptly, though.

yLQLBqVLaa	Since Cena is the Champ is all about Cena, tell me is that fair. there are some young superstars that want to shine , but he is like a big wall right now, until he is not the champ everything will flow ok....Believe me cena fans if he loses the title they will still love him..Main word is "Hot" , but most people dont want to see a pretty face winning , they want more action|`|01ee00687ebc38f27717ff052f633f4caa	Randy Orton, The Hardys and Cena are their main headliners.  What's really unfair in the WWE is that they have an entire other roster of unknown guys in the back who never get to wrestle on TV.  They get to do house shows & dark matches.  I would love to see some of them come out some time.|`|AA10846501	it's not only cena why people are losing interest it's the whole damned company ... cena is getting stale. and him beating khali was just too too ridiculous. the wwe has this guy like a god or something. He can't be beat, he don't back down from a fight, he made khali tap out, yet khali knocked him out in less than 10 seconds on raw with his bare hands. the guy needs to get his butt kicked some more. He is always too damn sure that he is going to win matches, he never goes into a match thinking that he may lose.<br>  <br>  the wwe writing team is getting lazy they are only focusing on writing stories for the chosen few. and everybody else can just become jobbers, or just hang out in the back until we find something to do with you. they need to involve all the guys on the roster in some story or the other and make them interesting. they have guys like val venis and vicera on the roster for one purpose only, to lose matches. <br>  <br>  They have become too predictable, the  minute u see val or big vis or someone else they cast aside in the ring you know they are just gonna lose the match and make the other guy look good. on raw tonight the whole damn world knew that lashley was going to win the gauntlet match because they know that the wwe refuses to do anything new unless a big star is put on the shelf so they are going to drag out this vince and lashly crap until people get sick of it... nothing at judgement day  was shocking it was all expected.. same thing for wrestlemania, and the royal rumble. <br>  <br>  the wwe is just sucking more and more every week. and they are going to drive themselves out of business. .|`|VFJQly42aa	If John aint the Champ then i'm canceling my yahoo.|`|mUAiXQfEaa	I hate wrestiling so who knows, but the guy does seem to cocky from what i have seen on clips of wrestiling.|`|hVwDy5NEaa	To me he just doesn't seem like a realistic champion.

z89bRq1laa	Well people don't like Kobe, they like his skills.|`|OBke2ynzaa	Ok, buddy, hop off your soapbox and chill out!  Like was said, people like Kobe the basketball player, but necessarily the "former adulterer."  And just becuase he did have an affair in Colorado doesn't mean he "cheats" like you say.  He may, he may not.  Who cares?  But you label him as a bad person, but you don't know him.  You are not the judge of him.  You say you are pure but you are not pure of heart if you are bragging and boast that you are better of a person than he is.

But he's going to have to suck up his pride & play for vet minimum until he demonstrates that he has an improved work ethic & can produce on the field.  I wouldn't be surprised if the reason he's not playing right now is that he and/or his agent won't accept a low-ball one or two-year contract.<br>  <br>  He also has to be willing to sign with a team that won't carve out a starting role for him.  He needs to realize that he's going to have to work & compete to regain a starting WR gig again.  He might be shopping for an opportunity to start, but no team in the league is going to pencil him in as a starter until he proves himself worthy over several weeks of practice.|`|453b597895ecdf3c4e24c0be5e2e1c1daa	I think he will and I think a good fit for him would be NFL Europe or Arena League!

7qerLR1oaa	No!!! Stop you are getting a rookie second wide reciever for a former two time rushing champion. The new coaches in Zona are from Pittsburgh.. their main objective is a strong offensive line and pounding the rock. Edge is the fantasy sleeper of the year and if he can even come close to his old production his trade value will soar. Number one running backs are priceless in fantasy and you will find this out if you trade edge. As far as your defenses are concerned if you dont like Jacksonville check the waver wire for the best matchup a defense has and pick up that defense, it will prove to be close to Baltimore in effectiveness.|`|5b09f1eeb355a7dd0ff8b23e44f61062aa	good trade...i'd do it......i think calvin will be a great receiver and will have a good rookie season...balt d is also better then j-villes and your RB's is still good without edgerrin|`|4PLPzFdNaa	TRADE RIGHT NOW.<br>  if edge does anything like last year he will suck majorly...do you want to take that chance????<br>  Baltimore defence is worth them both even without calvin<br>  CALVIN WILL WIN ROOKIE OF THE YEAR<br>  <br>  Farve is getting old and his skills are diminishing...driver wont have a good a season as last year all your other recievers suck get new ones and trade tatum bell they have kevin jones tatum is 3rd down and their playbook with Mike Martz is pass 3rd down|`|9FYj1LEMaa	I think if your going to trade a Starting RB, then your better off going for a different receiver.  Even all star rookies need to adjust to the skill level in the NFL. (see Reggie Bush weekly stats 2006)<br>  <br>  Jacksonville for Baltimore is a even trade giving Baltimore a slight edge for a better 2006 season.|`|amS7ghnBaa	I would not make this trade.  Edge will have a MUCH better year then last.  Arizona now has Pittsburgh's offensive coordinator and offensive line coach.  What was Pittsburgh dominate at all these years?  Running the ball......Edge will be a top 12 RB take that to the bank...If you feel you need to trade him for an upgrade at WR I think you can get a better WR then Calvin Johnson.  Don't get me wrong Calvin Johnson has the POTENTIAL to be a beast.  However, he has a pro bowl WR on the other side who will get more catches then him in Roy Williams.  Plus, Jon Kitna is wishy washy.  Id try and get a guy like TJ Housmazili because without Chris Henry he will get more looks.  I see him getting 80+ catches this season.  Hope this helps

AA11462380	Hmmm......yes and definetly NO. <br>  <br>  Yes: W.McGahee is a hell of a RB and he definetly do well behind that line in Baltimore!!!<br>  <br>  NO: A. Unless u really were desperately in need of a backup QB, J.Campbell probably was not the best answer. This would be because J.Campbell does have weapons, but they are few and far (S.Moss and C.Portis).<br>  <br>  B. Cam Cameron is the new coach in Miami. He was the former offensive coordinator in San Diego. Stop me if U know what I might say next (LT light in R.Brown???)<br>  <br>  and C. Calvin Johnson=6'5 240 rookie WR in Detroit+ Mike Martz's offensive system+ J.Kitna 4,000 yd last year+ R.Williams on the other side+CJ81 as a No.2 there???= <br>  <br>  75rec, 1100, 12td?!?<br>  <br>  so for short............maybe yes but mostly NO...|`|2a8aced08792dbec6f549be460dde041aa	all depends on calvin ... if you have confidence in a rook, then it's a bad trade ... if you're skeptical, then it's good.|`|NFcSezfeaa	lol you serious?? you should have been able to get campbell off the waivers for crying out loud. but i guess willis is the best of the four mentioned, so if your wrs are good it was a good trade.|`|W9V746DMaa	I don't like it.

You wont need any more pitches yet.  Work on a curve on the side during warm ups, Just be sure that you arm is fully developed and you are throwing it correctly.

I know that the Colorado fans payed taxes to have their stadium built (still paying taxes) and now they could be cheated out of 1 home game per season? To what?

Everyone talks about Honduras being the better team...but the reality is that they didn't score....Mexico scored....on its own goal but they scored....and they didn't!!  At home...and they couldn't score!!   After Vela was red carded.....Mexico almost tied the game with that header remember??   With 9 players!!  <br>  <br>  WHY DID THEY CELEBRATE THAT MUCH......because beating Mexico to them is LIKE Winning the world cup!!  All Central American teams feel that way and when they beat Mexico, they feel that their on top of the world....because that is the only thing they could be proud of....other then that....What has a Central American team won??  Or to be proud of??  Guatemalans like to talk trash...and look at their team!!  La SUB-40 compa!!  They are hurt that based on the fact that their teams try there hardest and they still fall short of qualifying to the world cup while Mexico plays like crap and still moves on!!!  That's what eats them up inside!!  Suffering....but always qualifying!  Them....always suffering but falling short!   When Mexico, USA, Costa Rica and Trinidad and Tobago(half of the ticket) move forward, lets see who keeps on talking! |`|U8X7v28Vaa	i completely agree with you<br>  <br>  if it wasnt for the autogol they wouldnt make it to the hexagonal|`|56365ccf12a9d3741995e9c3c1032fdbaa	I agree.  Why the extreme celebration?<br>  <br>  Now, I didn't get to see the game, but if I had, I would've been pulling my freakin' hair out.  It's just terrible from what I hear.<br>  <br>  Oppose this opinion all you want, but the Mexican team was playing a whole lot better when Hugo was still coach.  Even players like Villaluz(and the others that play like crap now) played really well.<br>  <br>  Now it just seems like the players don't really play with their all and the ones that do, have to play both attack and defense and in the end, end up getting really tired before the game finishes.  <br>  <br>  I dunno if it's Sven's strategy or lack of motivation, or what, but this HAS to get fixed before the next rounds...|`|71Y5RSEIaa	they are happy NOT because they beat mexico per say, they are happy because they qualified to the next round when jamaica could have easily took their place. it was so close.. even mexico could have not qualified (of course it was soo  unlikely to happen). i think your thinking that the reason they jump for joy is because they defeated a team like mexico. well thats not the case. it was a HUGE relief when they won and now they have a great opportunity to go to south africa 2010.<br>  <br>  EDIT: you guys are taking it too far. if you didnt lose and it was another team who lost to honduras, they would celebrate too... its because mexico lost that you guys are so concerned on what the hondurans do.|`|wjfTWdShaa	It doesn't bother me, I think its pathic that they're celebrating a mediocre display of football by their Honduras national team. If the tables were switched and Mexico pass with an autogol the way they played on Wednesday, the Mexican press would still be critisizing them as they are now. 
AA11322117	Tim Duncan -- he has more individual awards (NBA MVP 2x, NBA All-Star MVP, Finals MVP 3x) and team awards (NBA Champion 4x) than any of the other players on your list.|`|bMafoz6paa	Tim Duncan|`|3fTWxAuZaa	steve
AA11322117	Awesome video.<br>  To answer your question, I believe that it's almost a pre-requisite to master the skill of dribbling to become a top-tier point guard in the NBA.  I'm sure Nash, Paul, and Williams can all mimic Conley's drill.  However, by and large, I think most NBA point guards neglect the fundamentals of dribbling, which is why a consistent floor general is so valued in the league. |`|SjPAkqawaa	Mike Conley has streetball skills. NBA PGs are not trained to handle the ball like that but most of them are pretty slick ball handler too.<br>  <br>  The first NBA player with mad ball handling skill is Bob Cousy. He played 80's game in the 60's. <br>  <br>  The most natural ball handler I saw is Magic Johnson. He said he fell in love with basketball in 3rd grade and always dribbles a ball wherever he goes. In the streets, market, school. He always dribbles. When he comes in the NBA, he is like one with the ball and your only chance to steal that ball is after he passes it to a teammate.|`|bpL9jQqFaa	it is going to be tough for most  Point Guards to master this skill the way that Michael Conley can do. he is good and also fast.|`|3teWTOPqaa	I think Conley is a good player and the video is pretty sick, but he needs a good coach or a experienced to guide him along, and that's not going to happen with Memphis.<br>  <br>  As for the skill, I seen Amare do it in one of his commericals, and I remember T-mac did the thing in one of his, so I guess it's not that rare among NBA players, but I can't do it that well I admit.|`|dDhTMacAaa	Yes, in fact, I do think many point guards can master the skills he shows. That is part of the reason they are in the league.<br>  <br>  As for Conley, ESPN had him as the most talented point guard in last year's draft, and I agree. I think Conley will be a star for Memphis before we know it.
AA11322117	It's a fair trade, but I personally wouldn't make this trade if I were you.  Remember, you'd have to drop a player in a 3 for 2 trade, so it's really like Maggette, Barbosa, and Mayo for Martin, Oden, and [Thomas, Moon, or Collsion].  I think Magette and Mayo will have fine seasons, and I think Barbosa will be consistent but clearly, Martin is the best player of the group.  With Artest gone, he will be the second best fantasy shooting guard in the league (other than Kobe -- 3rd best if you count Wade as a shooting guard).  Plus, you're already thin on centers, so you'd have to make another trade for a center to compensate for this trade.  Like I said, it's a fair trade, but given your team needs -- and the fact that you have the best player in the deal with Martin -- I would not make the trade.  Good luck.|`|8KWuDE2Gaa	No I wouldn't do it.  Oden has potential to be a 12 rbs and 2 block guy.  Not to mention he is one of your starting centers...and you can't count on trading Barbosa and Mayo for a center either.  Keep with what you have on this one.  Martin will be above average and Oden might surprise you.  |`|gUKPJB66aa	bout even

j29eHSDqaa	This season... D-Wade.<br>  <br>  Just because he played at a high level at Olympics and begins the season "healthy".<br>  <br>  But Arenas is injured and we can't be sure about how he can came back.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...|`|AQmcZ0gYaa	Wade|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Gilbert Arenas had the highest scoring trio in the NBA this year w/ Caron Butler and Antawn Jamison and could not be healthy enough to take them far cause they always run into LeBron.<br>  <br>  However, you said if both Wade and Arenas were both healthy. I would take Wade because Arenas has had the highest scoring trio in the NBA for like what 5 years now. He has been relatively healthy and even had Larry Hughes instead of Deshawn Stevenson and only took them to the 2nd Round. Alpha Gilbert did go to the 2nd round they beat the Bulls in the 1st Round. But, then got swept by the eventual champs in Dwayne Wade, Shaq and Miami.<br>  <br>  In the playoffs.....<br>  Wade (1) - Arenas (0) - That's all that really matters....<br>  <br>  Plus, Wade has a ring and his best trio was in his rookie year when they had Caron Butler of Washington and Lamar Odom and they got to the 2nd round almost to the ECF lost in 6. <br>  <br>  If Wade did this with a less known Caron and Odom, who is not as good as Arenas.Then Wade is better.<br>  <br>  Plus, Arenas had Jamison in Golden State and they blew.|`|xeEOTsyYaa	Dwayne Wade. When Gilbert gets out of the first round, let alone wins a Finals MVP in maybe the most profilic individual series ever, tell me. Until then, Dwayne Wade by far. Arenas is a ballhogging version of Kevin Martin.|`|7X1H2AfWaa	Dwyane Wade because he has better stats and arenas can just shoot and get like 3 assists. D-Wade can shoot well, rebound and assist, like a lebron or kobe one step behind.|`|e8998d8c8bdf12a545b0dfe2fd77052caa	Wade. Led a team to the Championship.|`|DkwgogXZaa	Wade|`|AA11322117	Arenas is the more polished offensive player, as his outside shot is far superior to Wade's.  Indeed, Arenas is a sniper from anywhere on the court and could easily lead the league in threes if he was healthy for a whole season.  However, in terms of overall ability, Wade makes up for his poor outside shoot by other attributes that few players in the NBA possess.  For example, Wade has a bigger, more muscular frame than Arenas, which allows him to hold his own on one-on-one defense.  Additionally, Wade is a more athletic player than Gilbert, which makes him a more intimidating help-defender on the low block (as Wade's block numbers for a combo-guard are incredible).  Additionally, Wade also has a better ability at getting to the free throw line becuase of his athelticism (which is also a reason he gets injured so much).  Both Arenas and Wade are excellent passers and they are both savvy at playing the passing lanes for easy steals.  However, overall, Wade has the better all-around game, but offensively, Arenas doesn't get enough credit for his polished game.|`|rZmiyAqJaa	You can pretty much substitute any name you want on there for Wade and you'd still have the same answer. Arenas is nothing but an hugely overpaid, loudmouthed, playground player. If he wasn't a decent shot, he wouldn't even have a job.  Luckily for the leauge, and in the name of guys who CARE if they win or lose, he's already on the downside of his pathetic career. |`|16plOHuxaa	Wade is overall better because of height, young, attacking the basket is much more harder than three point range and he was named one of the hottest nba player, while Arenas shoots in the center of the 3pt line most of the time.|`|8FuwpE56aa	PLEASE HELP ME WITH MY QUESTION! i don't know about basketball but want to learn. please answer my bball questions!! <br>  thanks!!!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtpCj2xQbl6XiizjliLeK4nsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081016150043AAyrN3x">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjMJcI0GYaSLdk6dDbEIAp_sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081016144537AAGUR5W">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|0ytjj1EGaa	Wade Is A little Bit Better Than Arenas|`|l6RDDidsaa	Wade|`|yrBa2BNvaa	dwyane wade. arenas just has better range, but wade would kill him any day|`|Nz2rnhKyaa	Dwyane Wade<br>  Wade can do everything for you from slashing, playmaking, defense.

If you ask me about the NFL that is a different story.

hzttr76Maa	That's great for us. Since the Warriors are such a young team, Nellie will help develop Anthony Randolph into the system, and players like Brandan Wright and Bellenelli will improve. DeMarcus Nelson will help us while Monta is out, and Nelson will surely help us out during these rough times.|`|cf3b4c9a1788b436ca969afa64100affaa	Rather get Brandon Roy for 2 years.|`|kYBlgFQAaa	I'm glad to see Nelly will stick around for a couple of more years.  He may not lead them to a chapionship anytime soon, but he will keep them competitive.  Things are not looking quite so certain for Chris Mullin.  The division in the front office seems pretty apparent with many of their recent decisions.  Overall, things are looking up for the W's.  They have a lot of nice young talent in place.  Hopefully Nelly is able to develop it.  |`|3teWTOPqaa	I am happy for you guys, but I still think the Warriors need a few solid veterans in the mix with their developing youngsters.
DSJOxz0Qaa	The sad truth is that Kurt Warner is probably one game from being in the hall of fame.  Had he beaten Tom Brady and won that second Super Bowl for the Rams I would say, "Yes" he will be going to the HOF.  But the Hall of Fame is a very select group and unless you have superior numbers or you have won the big game multiple times as part of a dynasty you will be left out and unfortunately for Kurt he fits right in the middle.|`|9NDL5YQJaa	No, but he is kinda close.  2 time MVP, Superbowl MVP,  3 time pro-bowl, 2 time all pro first team.  He had three of the best QB years in a row 1999, 2000, 2001.  He won the superbowl.  25K yards, 162 TDs in his career.  |`|16561360453f1fcbaf919e880b04e02caa	Did he retire?

If he does get elected it'll be well down the line when they consider "well, he did climb the ranks of professional football, i guess that's worthy of something."  Suffice to say it's not a good bet to make.|`|E8yBW7u9aa	Warner has all the necessities to be in there, just by looking at the MVP honors he's received.  Jim Kelly never won a Super Bowl, but made it.  There should be no reason Warner wouldn't make it.  And he's a GREAT person too!|`|CvnoMSvuaa	not first time but by the second or third time cause he had a late start in his career he was in the AFL before the nfl and besides the superbowl he doesn't have much |`|mYnMeVVAaa	Yes Yes Yes, he needs to come back to the rams maybe then they win a few games.|`|bfd831fc22129c8c522639f390e60fc3aa	The HOF is special.  That said, KW would qualify for the HORG.  Hall OF REALLY GOOD.  Nuff said.|`|aa0fa91a713ec1ba11d8340d1da5ad85aa	I don't think so. He hasn't really had a HOF career.  Just a few good years.|`|JV5rlRyWaa	I think he deserves it|`|mvu0yrF8aa	yea he should be in the H.O.F. |`|MdOHwfABaa	He had a few years of success and then he had alot of years with no success at all, so I think not.|`|5oouAmkDaa	I think yes.. because when he was with the saint louis rams he was a monster...he was named superbowl mvp and has won many superbowls...he may not be his best right now but he once was |`|AA12103453	He almost deserves his own little spot in the Hall. I mean what other player is known for jumping from the Arena League to the NFL? Yeah he had a few good years, but come on he hadn't played much more then a few years in the NFL. I don't think he is going in the Hall though, unless it is a weak class. He's good but just not quite to that level.|`|X7O0Uxqxaa	No chance.

That's right, Kyle Orton.

e1ab168779ab47ff5a7f208e221eba8aaa	Rain on the faces will mask the tears of joy and despair very well.|`|o8ldhBfsaa	Well the Ferraris were fast in damp conditions in practice one but looking back at Silverstone, Monza, Monaco and Spa, Ferrari seems to lose control when in heavy rain. <br>  Yet the race isn't about who will be better, Massa or Hamilton? It is about Hamilton not making mistakes and winning the title or Hamilton screwing up and losing the title, Also Massa can hand him the victory. <br>  Wet conditions aren't usual in Brazil meaning a tricky race especially sector 2 which is tricky enough at dry conditions so mistakes are more possible. Hamilton doesn't need to be faster than Massa more than he needs to complete the race even if in 5th place. <br>  I think Hamilton wants it dry this time.<br>  As a Ferrari fan this is the only time this season I don't mind it raining too much, but any day I prefer a dry race. <br>  In rain conditions I think Alonso chances might be the highest also Heidfeld & Barrichello will have a chance in scoring some decent points  which  means tiny mistakes from Lewis can mean 3-4 cars slipping infront of him, not good. <br>  Massa isn't a good driver in rain so far but Kimi isn't good this year also, plus Ferrari promised that wet issues are over so rain may not be so bad afterall.|`|AA11861088	Hamilton can win if it's wet. Barrichello could get a shock win if a shock win happens. Remember Hamilton at Fuji last year? Remember him at Silverstone this year? The Ferraris have not been at their best in the rain this year. Although, the records will show Massa as the winner at Spa. Hamilton can be overly aggressive at times like at Monza pushing Glock onto the grass. So punishment and steward inconsistency is not out of the question. Barrichello to win in worsening conditions. Hamilton to do enough to seal the championship. Massa is too unpredictable(meaning he still might win) in the wet for me. So I won't try to predict his result.|`|aKKrJy0Faa	hamilton will try to push somebody out and he gonna spin and get ino gravel trap and his car gonna remain there for the rest of the race....or maybe .....forever....as an tribute to him!!....then it will become an wat say...eh....hmm....like what the bridge is for valencia...eiffel tower is for paris..taj mahal for india.. hamiltons McLaren for interlagos.....lol...<br>  <br>  first TD would be frm headsiwin...sure|`|kQa5qYYZaa	Never mind rain, even a safety car period will make Hamilton champion.  I worry about Ferrari's response whenever a safety car gets deployed.  <br>  <br>  It is looking good for Hamilton.  Once he makes it past the first corner tomorrow, the championship is over.|`|N7fNwIQSaa	It really spices things up!|`|JNs2qOVsaa	Usually i'd be jumping for joy at the news that there was a rainy race coming up, but not this one. We all know what the Ferrari is like in the rain (Silverstone?)  and we all know how lewis performs in the rain, but im desperately rooting for Massa to Clinch the championship in brazil. But saying that if Lewis does win in the rain it'll be a nice silver lining if its an exciting race.

1X8c2hEFaa	I have to go for Tim Duncan. I said tim duncan because he has proven a lot of things so he could be the best power forward of all time. Tim duncan carried the spurs to a lot of playoff. Since he was a rookie he was a candidate for the mvp. I didnt pick chris paul because he is too young. he hasn't proven that much.

He made Mo Peterson into an elite three point shooter.<br>  <br>  In terms of ballhandling, he's unmatched. He makes decisions while driving to the inside better than anyone besides LeBron.

Cant go with Paul cuz his jumper's still a little too eratic.  Plus his slight frame make him vulnerable to bigger, heavier guards like D. Williams, J. Kidd, or C.

dfa5e417572672af276d59d46c4ce702aa	Bryan Colangelo is said to have narrowed it down to two players, presumably Andrea Bargnani and LaMarcus Aldridge.  <br>  <br>  Colangelo has been enamored with Bargnani for a couple years now and the Raptors even hired his old coach in Italy as an assistant.  Granted, that hiring was in the works before the Raptors landed the top pick of the draft and before Bargnani had even declared for the draft.  <br>  <br>  Chris Bosh has advocated for LaMarcus Aldridge.  They've been working out together in Dallas and have become close friends. <br>  <br>  So, both have ties to the teams and both have impressed in workouts.  Still, I think the Raptors will take Bargnani.  I don't see Aldridge becoming a center in this league and I think they're trying to pull Bosh away from having to play center.  <br>  <br>  Answer:  Andrea Bargnani|`|11f67ece1475a18e8928d0a70e1f021baa	I say Bargnani probably but maybe Rudy Gay.|`|AA10543553	Adam Morrison.|`|3f686a2c858f0082a4b95aef159716d6aa	Brandon Roy the Raptors need to get another point guard because they will probably lose Mike James because of contract issues.

Sure, it's a bit crazy, but if he would somehow pull it off, he'd go down in history as not only one of the all-time great players, but the crazy guy who scored 44 points the day after Obama was elected.  Too bad it didn't happen.|`|AA11322117	Great idea, except... MELO CHOKED.  If Melo's going to say that, he needs to back up his talk.  That's just like Ruben Patterson proclaiming he was the "Kobe Stopper," only to have Kobe make a game-tying and game-winning shot in his face in 2004.  It's one thing to talk it, but Melo's got to walk it before I believe him.|`|TjCUwheSaa	to me who cares what he said i really did then vote an be side obama is not full blk he's have blk an white so i don't know whats the big hype|`|3teWTOPqaa	good job Melo.|`|fHxpycJSaa	He's the biggest talker in the league.

Yeah it wasn't a guarantee but still all I take from it is  last night he was more concerned about his own stats and accomplishments than his team.  Making a statement like that displays nothing but selfishness.  Then to back it up he scored 28 and his team lost to the Warriors.  Nice Melo.  Nice.|`|NJtjJA8Baa	Well, he came up about 15 points short, but he played well against the Warriors. I respect his effort, but the Warriors still broke it open at the end.

twRyCmSVaa	Depends.<br>  <br>  If Lebron and Paul are taken, I suggest Amare or Kobe. I actually think Amare may have better stats than Kobe (not neccessarily pts because as u know, pts isn't the only category in fantasy basketball).|`|8KWuDE2Gaa	I think so.  Amare will be linked to Nash and Nash is getting older.  Kobe will give you some good steals, above avg. 3s, pts, and good assist out of the SG slot.  |`|e8998d8c8bdf12a545b0dfe2fd77052caa	yes. he is worth a # 1 or 2 pick.|`|AA11322117	Absolutely.  If you're using standard settings - FG%, FT%, 3PM, Pts, Rebs, Assts, Stls, and Blks - then Kobe contributes in ALL of these categories -- a great asset for roto play.  Conversely, Amare (also a reasonable number 3 pick) gives you no 3pm and his link to Nash is undeniable.  Still, Kobe's points are most likely to go down this year (with Bynum's return), whereas Amare's are likely to go up (with Marion out of Phoenix).  If you want consistency and a covering of all stats -- go with Kobe.  However, if you want to get a rarer position earlier in the draft, Stoudemire is a good pick here too.  Of course, this is all assuming James and Paul are picked prior to your team -- as both of these players should be ranked as 1 and 2 respectively in either roto or h2h leagues.  Good luck.  Note -- if you don't have a FT% setting in your league -- Dwight Howard is an excellent 3rd pick (I'd actually take him over Stoudemire if FT% wasn't in the league settings).

LeBron's getting better every year so this could be the year where he starts being the top fantasy producer and there's no way your seeing a centre close to Amare's value if you pass on him at no.2.  Kobe never got his finger fixed because of the Olympics so I'd be wary of him.|`|PBuBIoCDaa	Chris Paul Lebron Kobe Then Amare
h6Eiq7CYaa	no don't do it.bush and Mcallister are splitting time with eachother and besides why would you want to get rid of Peterson|`|SVWxTi3taa	I wouldn't. Bush isn't a great fantasy player. He gets catches but he's not an every down back. In addition, McCallister is still trying to recover from a season ending injury. This also would mean trading a top 5 player for a maybe top 20 (Bush) and maybe top 40 (McCallister) and putting a lot of stock in one team's success.<br>  <br>  Peterson is maybe one of 3 or 5 guys you just do not trade right now in the NFL. Especially not for beans. He's trying to rope you. Don't get sucked in.|`|OlJYkbIXaa	You CANNOT let go of AP.|`|kAyhalUvaa	Depends on who else you would have to drop for them. I'd stick with Peterson though because if you have the two of them, I would assume you would only start one of them, which puts you in a position of having to guess each week, which is going to come out on top. Whereas Peterson is a guaranteed starter. If you have a three deep RB league and you only have one other legitimate starter, then I guess I would consider it. |`|faefe7527b3f7853f92c92e78224b6d2aa	Is your league a point per reception league?  If so, try to get Bush and a good WR then do the trade because Bush will get you points for catches and rush yards.  If not keep Peterson, he is a monster!|`|kaPHGf4Baa	i would. reggie bush is very valuable because you know he is gonna get catches. mcallister is gonna get touchdowns as well|`|gigAdxChaa	No way Jose.<br>  <br>  Why use two roster spots to equal the points Peterson points up in one spot. 
XHhJ8ffRaa	Although Marion Barber is a good pickup, giving up Ravens D for a useless Cards D and not so good Henderson is unacceptable. Out of five weeks, Henderson only had been good in a week or two. Colston is coming back so Brees will definitely go with his #1 WR instead of Henderson. Crayton is probably a bit better than Henderson.|`|1VQ1CqeYaa	DON'T DO IT<br>  <br>  You're giving up the best defense in the league and the 2nd best pass catching running back.  Gore is especially valuable in PPR leagues.<br>  <br>  I like Barber, but Devery Henderson is a bum that is to inconsistent to even have on your roster.  Stokley and Crayton are far better options than Henderson!<br>  <br>  You'd be making a mistake, and if I were in your league I will snatch up Stokley as soon as he hits the waiver wire.  Crayton is fast with good hands, and plays for one of the top passing teams in the league.<br>  <br>  Whatever decision you make, good luck!|`|36caca57ecd51ae84c9babc1799f1f9caa	gore for barber is alright(i like gore better, just cuz barber splits carries with felix) but there is no way henderson is better than crayton or maybe even stokeley.......... henderson will be riding the pines starting next week when colston n shockey come back.<br>  <br>  <br>  so i think this isnt a good trade and you should stand pat for this week and look at the overall picture not just this week.............. good luck|`|KQ2tPRR1aa	dont do it gore is better then barber for one and two henderson will soon find himself as the the third string receivers when the starters return like colston<br>  and your defense is amazing <br>  DO NOT DO THIS TRADE|`|cCIQdtlmaa	do it|`|xvs2OLrNaa	if u have to do it for this week then u should, but this will hurt in the long run

I don't know how to play chess so therefore I find that boring.|`|kNCfeSkZaa	Same reason Aussie football is boring to me I don't know what the heck is going on, don't understand it, just like you don't understand what is going on in Yankee Football.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	Why do you think it is?<br>  <br>  I'm guessing you're not American, because most folks outside the U.S. and Canada seem to have a problem with all the downtime between plays. But for those of us raised on American football, that's just part of the ebb and flow of the game. You get short, intense bursts of action followed by longer stretches of regrouping and strategizing for the next play. But those bursts of action can be absolutely thrilling. And the overall game is like a chess match, watching to see what the offense will run this play, and how the defense will counter it. Throw in some amazing long passes, circus catches, fast runners cutting through holes and tightroping up the sidelines, last-second field goals, brilliant touchdown catches, and bone-crushing tackles, and you've got an amazing, exciting spectacle on your hands.<br>  <br>  My guess (and no offense) is that you just don't understand what's going on. My wife was indifferent to gridiron ball until I taught her what was happening on the field, and now she watches the games with as much eagerness and excitement as I do.<br>  <br>  Do you like rugby at all?

He is also on the cover of the magazine. <br>  <br>  It appears from what he says he is quite busy with life doing different things which include:<br>  <br>  Motorbike racing<br>  Advisor to Ferrari on both road and race cars<br>  Involved in a luxury skyscraper Business<br>  <br>  One of his quotes is,"There were a few possibilities for me to return, but I made the right decision"<br>  <br>  So with that info, my conclusion is, NO he will not come back as a driver but he has not left Formula 1 as he is still an advisor to Ferrari.|`|u5ktfBULaa	Seriously, people need to stop asking this question.<br>  He stopped when he thought was the right time, years have passed since then, he hasn't gotten any younger.<br>  Unless old age damages his brain and loses the common sense he had back then it's not going to happen.|`|Ck2Xqc8Maa	i sure hope he does but i cant see it happening. i bet he wants to though, but he is 40 nearly |`|QidW9DRfaa	He's pretty much attended all the races this season as an advisor anyway but as for driving competitively again?

If he did he'd only ever drive for Ferrari and they have drivers under contract for the forseeable future.

He has virtually every F1 record already so he doesn't need to prove himself, although he probably can still win many championships! I'm sure he'll be a multiple WC in the Grand Prix masters series too in a few years time.|`|AA11861088	No. He races bikes and plays soccer to not get bored. He used to love testing and the fact that he still does occaisionally means he gets to ring the neck of the latest f1 monsters. (By that I mean drive the cars to the limit. Not choking Ecclestone and Moseley-lol!)|`|O4CimCZuaa	Although he does enjoy the sport, I doubt very much that he will come out of retirement.

Ferrari also have two contracted drivers, and I doubt Schumacher would consider anywhere else. |`|b0TKUh2Iaa	I doubt he'll race in F1 again but he's far from in retirement - his ugly mug has been a constant fixture at race weekends all season!|`|R2nAcaAFaa	no, he'll die in the retirement. |`|wOwHliwjaa	Nope..............I hope not.

They were already ranked in the top five and  they beat the number one team.  My thought is that if you are ranked highly and beat the number one team, then you are the number one team.  They were most certainly aided by Alabama having the week off.  If Alabama had played and notched an impressive win, they may be number one.  Of course, losses by Missouri and LSU helped as well.

The Big 12 is superb this year, but many of them haven't met this season just yet.  The SEC is just as good, maybe better, and they've been picking each other apart since early on, any one of them who comes through undefeated is definitly deserving.  Penn State shouldn't jump Texas, as their conference is weak, but Alabama probably won't either since the next couple games are tougher for Texas than them.|`|9ysR2tR7aa	I loved it.

e4ekb1amaa	Depends upon what you mean by the best QB...<br>  <br>  I think Randall Cunningham was the most talented QB the Eagles have ever had - he was a very unique QB, and was literally the entire offense when he was playing. He played for the Eagles during a period where the NFC East won 7 out of 10 Super Bowls, and was easily the most competitive division in the NFL. He was a constant threat to burn teams through the air and on the ground, and as Buddy Ryan always said - those Eagles teams were one or two offensive linemen away from a Super Bowl. Cunningham never had a pro bowler playing offensive line for him until he went to Minnesota, where he enjoyed his most productive passing season. <br>  <br>  Cunningham led the Eagles in both rushing and passing yards for 4 seasons in a row. Think about that.... That means he made essentially every play - he couldn't just hand off to a back like Westbrook (he didn't have a back like Westbrook), and he was running for his life behind a patchwork line. Not only did he run and throw - he did it effectively. His 1990 season is easily the type of season any scrambling QB dreams about. Despite minimal surrounding talent and playing in the best division in the NFL, he managed to lead his offense to respectability.. In 1990, the Eagles had the 3rd best offense in the NFL - Cunningham led the team in rushing and passing yards, and him and his TE Keith Jackson were the only two pro bowlers on the squad.... That's absurd. <br>  <br>  It was no secret - the only way to stop the Eagles was to stop Cunningham. Yet it was rarely something that defenses accomplished. Of course, he got injured the following season, and never quite was the same, but had he stayed healthy or had some more talent around him, that late 80s/early 90s eagles team would have had a super bowl title. <br>  <br>  McNabb makes a fine argument, but I think Cunningham was more integral to the teams success. When Randall was injured, the unit that finished 3rd in the NFL in offense with him as QB finished 25th the next year with Jim McMahon at QB. When McNabb has been injured, the replacements always seemed to do alright (obviously not as well as McNabb would have, but still were productive). McNabb also had a much better line (a very overlooked asset), and a back who makes a fine argument to be listed among the best in the league. <br>  <br>  Perhaps McNabb's biggest advantage is having an offensive-minded coach. Andy Reid makes great use of gameplanning and getting production out of marginal players. Buddy Ryan barely understood anything about offense other than it was what he wanted to stop when he was coaching defense. He would literally throw Randall out there and let him do what he felt was best. <br>  <br>  So I think Cunninghams the best QB on the list, and I don't know that there is another QB I would ever take above him when he was in his prime. That being said, McNabb will undoubtedly have the best career, and God-willing will be able to finally bring a Lombardi Trophy to Philadelphia.  |`|dD6bmcTZaa	1.McNabb<br>  2.Cunningham<br>  3.Jaws|`|2CuuIT70aa	McNabb<br>  Cunningham<br>  Jaws|`|mvu0yrF8aa	Randall Cunningham cause he was a very good scrambling qb.|`|8ZSJn0cxaa	I don't know about the other two, but McSadd is very pathetic. I don't mean to hurt your feelings if you're an Eagles fan, but personally, I hate McNabb. I believe he's never going to win a Super Bowl title. He's what some of the other NFL fans call a fragile crybaby. Even Ben Roethlisberger, Tom Brady, Jason Campbell, and other QBs are better than McNabb.|`|c104e62da085666729ad7d666f2621c9aa	I think a healthy McNabb is the best, but (and I am a HUGE Eagles fan) his propensity of getting injured means that I have to place him second on this list to Cunningham. Cunningham SHOULD be a hall-of-famer (<a href="http://www.slate.com/?id=2070146)." rel="nofollow">http://www.slate.com/?id=2070146).</a> However, if McNabb stays healthy and in Philly for a season or two (and plays like he did in the frist 3 games, minus the fumbles) the answer will switch to McNabb.|`|l182Kum3aa	Donovan McNabb|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	Geez...People on here are either on McNabb's nuts or are too young to remember Randall Cunningham...who was the last good QB of the Vikings 10 years ago, BTW...<br>  <br>  Give me Cunningham over McNabb any day...|`|FKN9kBvLaa	Mcnabb no question.  He's their all time leading TD and yards qb, and he has the best TD/Int rational of any QB EVER!  I think he is the most underrated QB of all time.  When he has no weapons and the team doesn't produce, everyone's blaming him despite the fact that since he has a much better record and better stats than the beloved Brett Farve since he's entered the league.
ejrVotg8aa	I thought Favre showed his true colors earlier this year, that he thinks he's bigger than the team. And I think he was hurt when the Packers showed him that he wasn't. They made the right call and looking at the season so far, it's clear that they have. I think it was pretty classless of Brett but I have the feeling it wasn't as harsh as it seems. I have the feeling he didn't search out the Lions staff to feed them info. He was talking to Millen and it just happened. I wouldn't put it worse than Spygate, but it falls in line with the real Brett we're getting to know. He needs Big Irv to slap him back in line. |`|qThmcR1Aaa	Agree with you 100%. He has betrayed the organization and the fans that loved him, supported him through good times and bad, and helped make him famous. This is how he treats us -- like a selfish, spoiled little brat who throws a temper tantrum when he can't get his way. I'm just sorry I spent 16 years rooting for him.|`|E1Qo10f2aa	I think the Packers front office betrayed  Favre with the greatest betrayal, now he is free to get back at the Pack, when and where he wishes.

UhopY5t5aa	Edwards and Coles<br>  Edwards cuz he is going up against Cincy and they are just an all around awful team this year.  Word is Anderson is getting the start which could be a good thing for this game, the fact that he actually has experience means he knows how to get Edwards the ball where as if Quinn were to step in it might take him a while to find his rhythm just like Cassel in NE<br>  Coles cuz he turned into a prime target last week for Favre catching 6 passes one of which was a TD.  Against the cardinals I would expect him to do the same same thing. |`|938c884b01a162594f2dea609ff3c42caa	DeSean Jackson has become the Eagles' #1 WR during their injury woes, and the Bears have not been stout against the pass this year, so he's a definite play.<br>  <br>  I'm tempted to dust off Braylon Edwards for the Cinci game since the Bengals' D is shaky & the Browns/Bengals games have been good for fantasy points in recent years.  Feeling lucky?<br>  <br>  Arizona's D is underrated & Coles hasn't been getting as many looks as Cotchery for the Jets, but he'd probably still get 3-5 catches and 40-60 yards, and possibly a TD.<br>  <br>  VJ against Oakland would be the safest play, even though Chris Chambers seems to be getting the most love from Rivers.

7sWWt72waa	Even though the Jags are playing Houston, you should start Eddie Royal. He is in a much better offense, passing game wise, and Cutler has shown great confidence in him already. Jerry Porter has been hurt all season, and I cannot think of why he would become a stud right away. They (the Jags) are a run first offense facing a decent pass rush in the Texans. The Broncos face the Chiefs who cannot stop a sneeze or their own bleeding. It should be pretty ugly for the Chiefs 'defense' this weekend. |`|938c884b01a162594f2dea609ff3c42caa	Royal, no question.<br>  <br>  Even when Porter comes back, he'll have to win a starting job against Matt Jones, Reggie Williams, and a recovering Troy Williamson.  Unless you have a big roster & can stash Porter away, there's no need for him to be on your roster right now.  He needs to produce points for a couple weeks first.|`|uMDM0xQraa	I believe Jerry Porter is hurt, and also the Jags aren't a strong passing team. Denver is playing the second, if not for the rams, worst defense in the league...Cutler gonna spread it all over the field....<br>  <br>  Royal all day!|`|LyGgENV1aa	Eddie Royal.....the broncos have been lighting up the opposition with passing touchdowns....Royal and Marshall r gonna have a field day with the saints this week...
aG3lSLBCaa	Walter Payton   4sure.   Emmitt had alot of help at Dallas<br>  <br>  NO ONE has ever accounted for more ALL-PURPOSE yards then Walter Payton. Over 22,000 yards that record may never be broken<br>  <br>  Rushing, Recieving, passing, Kick off returns, punt returns, and Field goals  Walter did it ALL<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|8ZSJn0cxaa	Smith and Payton were legends of their time, but I'd rather have Walter Payton as an RB if I was a football coach.<br>  <br>  Today I'd either want Willie Parker, Clinton Portis, Reggie Bush, or Brian Westbrook (even though I hate the Eagles). Mostly Parker because I think he's a FAST player on the field, and cause the Steelers are my favorite team. |`|mvu0yrF8aa	obviously Walter Payton|`|m8yOGvMSaa	Either Payton or Barry Sanders!

Emmitt had *alot* of help when he was in Dallas. 
mvu0yrF8aa	go to the redskins team site|`|9lDqqQ8Iaa	I believe they are in the $120 range. I remember that we were offered club level and they were approx. twice what we are paying for our $64 upper level seats. If you are interested, I am selling the next two home games (Rams, Browns) for $120 a pair, including a free cash lot permit which is worth $52. |`|hq46T7UWaa	The Redskins are ultra shady about their prices because they want to up sell you when club seats become available (other ones rarely become available).<br>  <br>  But since they sell out nearly every game, face value doesn't really matter...market does (supply & demand). If the skins are bad or are facing someone mediocre you can find tickets cheaper than face value.
SEcM9EDZaa	The head coach in Oakland is nothing more than a figuehead so it really doesn't matter who he is or how long he lasts.

EfQAdSipaa	Farve is my man|`|XHhJ8ffRaa	They both should be good start. Although Rodgers is banged up, GB is lacking a running game so Rodgers should pile up some passing yards. Favre is going against a weak D so he too should have good game. Favre has an edge in terms of health.|`|cLlY0pE5aa	Favre|`|938c884b01a162594f2dea609ff3c42caa	Favre is a safer bet than Rogers mainly due to Rogers' health.<br>  <br>  Favre is coming off a bye week while Rogers is still recovering from the Falcons.  That's the main thing that jumps out at me.  Both Cinci and Seattle have poor defenses, and neither the Jets nor Packers have established strong running games, so either one is a good pick.  But I'd go with Favre.|`|wjHuqATXaa	Favre...Rodgers has been struggling and CIN is garbage|`|dILpu2n0aa	Farve for sure|`|uksTzIRraa	U got 2 solid QBs and both with great match ups. CIN D sucks and Eli torn up SEA last week. <br>  Rodgers threw for 3 TDs with a bum shoulder and well Favre is Favre and he did throw for 6 TDs 2 weeks ago. So with that said I would choose Favre just cus he is getting in the groove with his new teammates and Rodgers might hurt his shoulder in the game at anytime..<br>  Good Luck!|`|ZsnTZmn5aa	Favray!!!!!  He dated Mary in "What about Mary"  Hilarious, who saw that coming?

kgBPU4xxaa	Johnson is the best long term pickup of that group. He's also integrated into the passing game. It's hard to believe he's available in your league. If you had needed one for this week McClain would be a good option. |`|938c884b01a162594f2dea609ff3c42caa	They'd all be good pickups, but I'd go with Chris Johnson.  He's getting 19.4 touches per week (including 20 last week).  He's clearly the primary back in that offense.<br>  <br>  Le'Ron McClain is doing very well for fantasy owners, but he's only getting 17.8 touches per week (and only got 13 last week.)  Baltimore also plays five of the next six games on the road & the schedule gets quite tough during playoff time.<br>  <br>  Tim Hightower is a short-yardage TD vulture, certainly, but he's only getting 9.2 touches per week.  He has a bye next week, but then has a reasonably easy schedule ahead of him.|`|QXACiXvXaa	Hightower would be a good pick up but if Johnson is out there you have to get him.  He's having a great season and seems to be getting better as the season goes on.|`|IQZNkeNzaa	Dude pick up johnson right away I have had him for a few weeks and he is playing great.
938c884b01a162594f2dea609ff3c42caa	The only downside to starting Eli Manning is that the Giants may get a big lead & then start emphasizing the run.  Regardless, he should have a very good day.<br>  <br>  Tampa Bay's defense may be a challenge for Delhomme, and Hasselbeck is just starting to get his WR corps back.<br>  <br>  Brandon Jacobs will get the majority of fantasy points for the Giants' RBs.  I'd start Westbrook (assuming he's healthy.)|`|p6BSvLIraa	I would go with Eli Manning against Cleveland's defense.  He should tear them apart especially with Plaxico Burress back as well as Amani Toomer.  I would watch Westbrook's progress, he has 2 broken ribs, so unless you will be on Sunday morning checking statuses, I would put Derrick Ward in.|`|G4CMn8hDaa	Manning, he should have at least 2 or 3 TDs against the Browns. I would wait till Saturday or Sunday morning to decide on Westbrook, because of his ribs.
bU83AJtuaa	Ray Rice received an "ok" amount of carries last week, simply because BAL was behind and had to pass and he and McGahee are better receiving backs than Le'Ron McClain. He highly doubt he'll receive anywhere near as many looks this week<br>  <br>  Tashard Choice? Hes behind Marion Barber simply because King Felix is hurt, Tashard may get you a couple of points because he gets 1 or 2 tackles on special teams, youd be better of picking up a 3 year old and starting him.<br>  <br>  Rudi Johnson has been seeing most of the carries in the D and with Orlovsky starting the Lions arent going to Air it out as much (especially with the loss of Roy)<br>  <br>  So I'd take Rudi over those 2|`|HrhdhoZgaa	rudi johnson is the best out of them
dfeb00a8727feb0b038ed889d65e5c7aaa	Curtis and Faulk.|`|UPWtKwz0aa	Kevin squared!  Wait to see what Morgan does.  Curtis was the man last year and Faulk should get carries with Morris out.|`|d22cd2fe77adbd4fdd019748568853bdaa	Morgan & Curtis, unless your playing  me this week
6i8ZrnATaa	kevin faulk is the best out of these choices and he will run big against STL and he did it to denver last week who has a better D|`|AA11594209	Kevin Faulk, no doubt, with Morris injured and Maroney out for the season Faulk will get most of the touches and don't forget Cassell loves to drop of the ball to Faulk in the backfield, so thats receiving and rushing yards. Williams just doesn't get enough touches especially in the failing wildcat formation and the phins are playing against a tough Bills d-fense. And Josh Morgan.......who? pretty much self explanatory!!!!
vwZIhpqnaa	Thomas.  
sCavhy9haa	I would start Curtis and Holmes...Olsen is too much of a wild card, but for that matter so is Holmes.. I like Ben throwing to Holmes more than Orton to Olsen.|`|Nae32k07aa	holmes<br>  curtis|`|fd699e2b4fff6fe7adedd8b10fd1506caa	I would start Greg Olsen for sure. He has been Kyle Orton's favorite target as of late and the Bears are playing against the Lions 31st ranked pass defense this Sunday. <br>  <br>  I would also start Kevin Curtis. The Eagles are playing against the Seahawks and  look for Curtis to catch a long TD pass this week.
lV0IKNoFaa	I project success for you in this order<br>  Holmes<br>  Olsen<br>  Curtis<br>  Hightower<br>  Grant<br>  <br>  I am a Packers fan and I do not, nor have I ever, bought into Ryan Grant.  Why did the Giants keep three RB ahead of him ?  Geez, I wonder.  Oh I don't want to come to training camp because I want a bigger contract.  But I'll stay in shape.  Bullshit.  Bullshit.
j29eHSDqaa	Nice team, but....<br>  <br>  Strong at Points & assists.<br>  <br>  Weak at Blocks & Steals.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ---------------------------------|`|AA11322117	It's a good team but be careful -- Baron may be out for the first month of the season, and Monta won't be back until December.  I think you shoudl trade those guys for active players to garner more points.  I love the Miller pick, he's going to break out in Minnesota.
AA11322117	I believe it has to do with the offensive schemes of Avery Johnson as compared to Phil Jackson.  In the triangle offense, George was able to capitalize on his 3 point shooting ability by having more spacing on the floor.  This also allowed him to drive to the whole without as much traffic.  Conversely, in Johnson's system, George has to play an offensive scheme that is more oriented to the low-post kick-out standard, which focuses more Nowitzki.  Lastly, George's age and his disposition (whether or not he likes the team or his role on the team) should be factored in too.|`|3teWTOPqaa	He has always been a role player, and he plays the triangle offense pretty well, and that's not the offense in Dallas, plus when he was with the Lakers, he always had Kobe or Shaq to make him look good.<br>  <br>  I am hoping J-Kidd can help Dallas into a contender.|`|8c150d798507c1b0ae472762150207b6aa	What up Clyde 22,<br>  <br>  With the Lakers George was more of a spot up shooter, and during his tenor with the Lakers- because of Shaq's presence in the middle- Deaven could spot up for Open 3(s).  Off course Deaven was pretty inconsistent back then- but you give any shooter wide open looks they should be able to hit them.<br>  <br>  I think Dallas' offense was a bit more motion oreitned which Deaven has not always been good in that setting.  i think also in Dalls part of it is mental (Mark Cuban put Deaven in a tough spot) last year with the whole Jason Kidd trade thing- and definitely that got to Deaven's head.  i don't think it's realistic to ever expect Deaven to average 25 points a game (i can't remember him doing that with the Lakers- if he did it might have been over a 2 or 3 game stretch).<br>  <br>  I think Deaven is a role player who the Mavs can hope to get 8 to 10 points a game.<br>  <br>  Nickster|`|wgyHdDa0aa	any players used to play for the lakers suck! look at shaq,smush, divac, george, the list can go on! i suck now i am playing for the boston celtics!|`|ZTR6YWZCaa	Thats easy...no Shaq for opponents to double team and give him easy wide open looks

AA11322117	Defense is all about positioning.  If you find that you're not quick enough for on-ball defense, then see if you can help your team by a defensive scheme (i.e. floating defense or defending the passing lanes).  To work on defense, the best thing to do is to practice with someone else and try to anticipate their moves.  Be careful to focus on footwork -- as this is an underestimated facet of a defender's game.<br>  <br>  As for driving to the hole, develop a taste for it by practicing on a smaller goal where you can dunk.  After a few throwdowns, you'll gain some confidence to try it on regulation.  The main thing with driving is tto keep you head up and to not fear contact (as it is inevitable).  Good luck, and keep working on that J.|`|wmWrcN0faa	If you can shoot then knock down a few shots so your defender will guard you closer.  Then use a pump fake to get him off the ground and you can drive right past him to the hoop.  <br>  As far as defense, it basically comes down to quickness, you have to use your quickness to always stay between your man and the basket.  And if your man doesn't have the ball you gotta always keep one eye on him, and one eye on the ball wherever it is.|`|90AqRYSlaa	The only advice I can give you is to work tirelessly at the things you need to improve on.  Try doing drills and exercises that help improve your quickness.

RgLHREIbaa	I thought Heikki was brilliant in 2007 and was excited to see him at Mclaren. But have been completely underwhelmed by him this season. Hopefully he will push Lewis a bit more this season but I'm not holding my breath|`|AABTSionaa	I do not see Heikki beating Hamilton.  Overall, he has not been on par with Lewis.  McLaren has a great car but Heikki is 7 in drivers points.  He will get better and be in the 3 to 5 range but do not see it...unless Lewis wrecks or blows engines more.|`|AA11861088	Some thought the floodgates would open when he got his first win. But he's most likely to pick up wins on tracks that are better suited to the McLarens if Lewis fails to finish. That's judging by his performances this year. But maybe cars with less aerodynamic grip and more mechanical grip will suit his driving style more. He did well in GP2 where they had slick, ungrooved tyres and less wing and no power steering. So maybe he'll have learned enough in 2 years to adapt better than hamilton to the changes with power assisted steering. But Hamilton won the GP2 Formula. So you never know

It was a legal goal because the ball came off the defender last and as such the Swiss player could not be offside.The reason the linesman had his flag up is because he thought it was a Swiss player who had touched it last,but the ref had seen it come off the Korean player and rightly over-ruled the linesman.Sorry Korean fans but there will be no rematch and there are no grounds for one.|`|09abc82fdc1f5a6a466451dc9f826a04aa	We are talking about FiFa 2006 not what happened 4 years ago.

Off-side after ball is touching the defender is still off-side. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.fifa.com/en/news/feature/0,1451,107252,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fifa.com/en/news/feature/0,14...</a><br>  <br>  The above is the flash link explaining off-side rules.<br>  The ref. was wrong.|`|7d4e6a2a32d1ce41a94da2d14e5691a0aa	i dont know about what happened in 2004<br>  but this game was totally wrong<br>  the referee was totally on swiss' side|`|847d3a66143b3b2f4b053154e1c8a5aaaa	Koreans say it was offside because they lost,<br>  but you guys are not the only ones who are lost!<br>  And do you know better than the referee about the soccer rules?<br>  Than how come you aren't one? Do you have a proof? <br>  When you get one, let me know.??<<br>  I'm Korean as well (kinda), and i'm also sad that we lost, but don't you know that you guys acting like babies and not accepting the fact that we lost is really ambarassing?<br>   And even if the second goal was offside, we still lost. So stop wasting your time blackening Korea's reputation and forget about it. DOn't you have better things to do? Like saving the world? k

The more shyer girls had a friend hold a towel in front of them and changed.  I have managed to get in and out of a swim suite at the beach by wrapping a big towel around me, and holding it together with my teeth.  My arms are inside, so I can change easily.|`|60tROVS3aa	Many of the girls on my swim team, when necessary, can do a deck change one of two ways. I’ve seen girls with really long towels do exactly what the guys do when they deck change but instead of tying the towel around their waist they tie the towel closer to their shoulders and they don’t seem to have a problem with it and it does a good job of coving up. Another way I’ve seen is actually changing underneath clothes. Where the girl will deck change her bottom half and just bring the suit up under the shirt she is wearing. They then take the bra and shirt off and viola, their good to go. |`|opKfRfm8aa	haha also you can tie your swimsuit over your top, and then pull ur top off. it works best when you only have a bra on, but with a shirt on it still works. i do it alot at the beach cuz there arent any bathrooms|`|JMCrknqCaa	when i took swimming in high school, we just changed in front of our locker and the girls who were not comfortable changing in front of others, changed in the shower stalls.|`|X5fo6Cfjaa	We deck change by having two girls hold the towel while we change.If you try it yourself,it can easily fall down.It's happened to me before.|`|cF1x7Zlxaa	dude<br>  <br>  theres this amazing invention called a locker room.....

The manager at liverpool is the favorite to lose his job next and a loss here could spell the end of his tenure. I think that liverpool need to win or tie, and get 1 away goal. Another thing you must remember is that madrid dont have much pace on the wings except for ramos and they play narrow. So i believe liverpool should play like this.<br>  <br>  GK-Reina<br>  RB- Arbeloa<br>  CB- Carragher<br>  CB- Skrtel<br>  LB- Aurelio<br>  CM- Mascherano<br>  CM- Alonso<br>  CM- Benayoun<br>  RW- Gerrard<br>  ST- Torres<br>  LW- Babel<br>  <br>  Attack Real Madrid and you can always switch to a 4-4-2 defensive.|`|8zgFyfibaa	So you're trying to play like the italians (anti-soccer) if liverpool were to play only defensive and use the counter attack the liverpool would loose, real madrid is playing good and liverpool needs to play offensice if they want to go to the next round. <br>  <br>  I say for liverpool to win the should use the <br>  4-3-3 formation.|`|A1cCdluFaa	4-4-2 ( positions left to right)<br>  <br>  In goal: Reina (obviously)<br>  <br>  at the back: Aurellio - Agger - Carragher - Arbeloa<br>  <br>  midfield: Riera - Alonso - Mascherano - Benayoun (2nd half subbed for Babel)<br>  <br>  Upfront: *********Torres********** - Kuyt<br>  <br>  that would be my team.|`|uUitKmJMaa	Reina<br>  Arebeloa Carragher Skertal Aureilo<br>  Kuyt Masherano Alonso Riera<br>  Gerrard<br>  Torres.<br>  <br>  Gerrard would be playing off torres in my formation...<br>  <br>  No gerrard i'd use.<br>  <br>  Renia.<br>  Arebeloa Carra Skrtal Aureilo<br>  Benayoun Mash Alonso Riera<br>  Kuyt torres.<br>  <br>  in a 4-42|`|lkNJNnlSaa	Yeah i would agree with that team.<br>  <br>  But if Gerrard were fit i would put him in place of Benayoun, leave Kuyt where he is and bring on Benayoun later in the game (bench).|`|1WgOj89kaa	Reina<br>  Aurelio<br>  Carragher<br>  Skrtel<br>  Arbeloa<br>  <br>  Alonso<br>  Mascherano<br>  <br>  Riera<br>  Gerrard(If Not, Benayoun)<br>  Kuyt<br>  <br>  Torres|`|YgUCXYuxaa	gerrard is fit and is playing. as long as we keep lucas as far away from the pitch as possible we will be fine|`|sx78czbxaa	The same one as yours.|`|jiFHJ6daaa	______________ Reina ______________<br>  ________________ _________________<br>  ________________ _________________                                           _ Carragher _ Skrtel _ agger---Aurelio _<br>  ________________ _________________<br>  ________________ _________________<br>  _______ Mascherano _ Alonso ________<br>  ________________ _________________<br>  __ Kuyt ______ Benayoun ____ Riera __<br>  _________________ ________________<br>  _________________ ________________<br>  _______________ Torres _____________|`|EIsnATLxaa	Reina <br>  arbeloa carragher skrtel insua-if he is there if not aurelio<br>  mascherano  alonso<br>  kuyt  riera<br>  stevie g//babel if stevie dont play<br>  torres<br>  <br>  <br>  i'd bring on benayoun last 30mins

Eq6LEVq0aa	If a captain was forced to declare say after 150 overs test cricket becomes a limitted overs match, and that for me takes away what test cricket really is.<br>  <br>  But i think what your saying is right, I mean the test in Karachi for me was an absolute waste of time, it looked like batting practice to me.<br>  <br>  Test cricket lies in the pitch, the ICC should enforce rules on how the pitch is to be prepared for test cricket in all the different countries.We want to see good equal pitches that suit both the bowlers and batsmen but we don't want to see the same type of pitch in every country. I think it's basically up to the ICC to step in and enforce some rules in regards to the preperation of the pitches in different countries.<br>  <br>  If all the test matches were like the one in Karachi, test cricket would have been dead and gone by now, it's upto the ICC to stop dead drawn matches from occuring.|`|Vv465eJMaa	Pitches are awful these days around the world.They are flat,slow lifeless and offer no result.Just like the international umpiring panel,there should be the same for test pitch preparers.They should be flown over 2 weeks before test and prepare a good track which offers a bit for both batters and bowlers.The pitches should turn or spin more as it wears.<br>  Antiqua in the old stadium,the recent test was the nearest to getting a result for 7 years,ridiculous.|`|8T0Z0Y17aa	It would have to be a limit on overs, else a bowling side may bowl their overs with a deliberate slow over rate to stop a team getting as many overs as they could do before a forced declaration.|`|ZT9I6uJLaa	i agree with simian..............test cricket is the original format of cricket.........it is original.........t20 is jus nt cricket.......it has an interface of cricket and industry..........|`|xU7AaQOdaa	There is more than one form of Cricket.<br>  <br>  T/20 fulfils a commercial need, but there is more to the greatest game in the World than cheap thrills!|`|OJtFNjfvaa	No, Tests are perfect they way they are|`|561a42dcf730fd97fc3a2ebd788ea961aa	yes ,.. but that depends ...on million factors..<br>  cheers~|`|1ayvDGcLaa	It seems the majority of your responders (so far) would prefer to have boredom foisted on us in the name of tradition.  I heard somewhere that Karachi had around only 200 people in the stands.<br>  <br>  I wonder what your responders would say if they were forced to watch these dreary matches (from the stands).  Would they have the same appreciation for tradition?<br>  <br>  edit*<br>  <br>  since you raised the commercial aspect of cricket, another thought is to link match fees to the entertainment value the teams provide. If they entertain the audience they get a bonus and if they drag on; the captain gets penalized.<br>  It reminds me of  the Roman world where gladiators would live or die based on performance|`|i99wjcNYaa	Interesting suggestion and I think it is a viable option. I highly doubt it would ever happen but giving 150 overs seems good and it may encourage people to play slightly more shots on flat tracks. However I personally was quite excited this morning with the possibility of a world record being broken so it would cut out the possibility of world records.|`|AA10576425	I don't know if that is a good thing. But definitely they changed the rules half way.. When cricket was started first, they did not have limitation of 5 days.. They can bat for a week if they can.. That's why there was no restriction on when a team should declare..<br>  They changed the duration to 5 days.. We have been seeing many draws after that!<br>  Probably a better solution would be to prepare sportive pitches.. Rather than batting or bowling paradises..|`|v811KD7raa	what about the overwhelming majority of tests for which such an outcome doesnt occur?<br>  <br>  changing well-established rules in response to rare occurrences seems unnecessary to me<br>  <br>  if people want pop-cricket they can watch 20-20 games.  theres absolutely no need to dumb down the proper game to cater for their tastes|`|cuq2Dv8vaa	GOOD SUGESTION.<br>  but i dont think itll be implemented.<br>  them test also would also be kind of limited over matvh|`|ocPlxCIeaa	This would Change the basic meaning of "TEST' Cricket.<br>  <br>  Cheers !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|iGhaHeCHaa	No|`|QDgVDqZ4aa	The captain of the batting side may declare an innings closed, when the ball is dead, at any time during a match.<br>  <br>  A captain may forfeit either of his side's innings. A forfeited innings shall be considered as a completed innings.<br>  <br>  A captain shall notify the opposing captain and the umpires of his decision to declare or to forfeit an innings. <br>  <br>  The captain should declare a innings if they have a high enough total because most captains take the piss and carry on batting the whole time because they are scared of losing.<br>  <br>  They should declare so the crowd gets involved and they gey a good game for what they are paying for.<br>  <br>  Test cricket is the longest form of the sport of cricket. It has long been considered the ultimate test of playing ability between cricketing nations. It remains the most prestigious form of the game, although the comparatively new One Day International and Twenty20 formats are now more popular amongst some audiences.|`|TVuA386waa	Put simply.... No.  As briefly as possible,  here is why.<br>  <br>  You are correct in as much as the recent Test in Karachi sending out wrong signals about Test cricket, but that doesn't mean that the answer is unnaturally curtailing the innings. Doing that is akin to allowing the proverbial tail to wag the dog. Instead the ICC should in such cases be looking at the home authority with a view to punitive sanctions for preparing a pitch that fails to offer a fair contest between bat and ball.<br>  <br>  Simply removing the option of a captain to bat on at his discretion would change the fundamental nature of the game. As any cut-off point approached the bowling captain would simply resort to ever more negative runsaving bowling tactics safe in the knowledge that in a few overs he can just walk off without bothering himself with the effort of bowling the other side out. And that would be like the middle 25 or so overs of a typical stultifying ODI innings,<br>  <br>  And what would you do if the maximum innings length was say 150 overs and the fourth innings of the match commenced with six full sessions left. Do you simply walk off after tea on the fifth day if not all wickets are taken but the side batting hasn't scored enough runs to win? Is it a draw? Or abandoned as a no result?<br>  <br>  To be brutally honest, it is a terrible idea. The whole point of Test cricket is that it offers captains virtually unlimited scope in their tactics, so long as they have the skill available to them to execute such tactics, and therefore presents the opposition with the TEST of overcoming that tactic with a superior one, or superior execution of skill, or both, in order to win the match.<br>  <br>  If you can't be bothered to watch proper cricket then there are more than enough ODIs and 20/20 to keep you amused.|`|aIhVHfMUaa	Absolutely Not!!<br>  <br>  personally, i think it has nothing to do with whether the Captain declares or not, i think the main problem has nothing at all to do with the captains and that they should not be forced to declare<br>  <br>  the pitches on the other hand, now THERES YOUR PROBLEM!!!<br>  <br>  for FAR to long now, curators have been preparing absolutely dull lifeless pitches that no bowling attack in the world could possibly take the 20 wickets required to win a test match. also authorities have alot to answer for in regards to this, they are known to tell curators to prepare wickets GUARANTEED to last 5 days, so they can get the maximum amount of money from sponsors and TV rights, the administrators that are doing this have absolutely NO REGARD for test cricket<br>  <br>  groundsmen world wide should be forced to prepare wickets that what i regard as perfect, some pace and bounce on days 1-2, that will fade into very good batting conditions for days 2-4 and on day 4, there should start to be some assistence there for the spinners, which would increase for day 5<br>  <br>  that way there is something in the wicket for all 22 players in the match, but i dont hold my breath waiting for it to happen accross the board, but sometimes today it does happen!<br>  <br>  when it does, it makes for the best matches to watch|`|8dhe15MUaa	no way|`|IDBasYahaa	No, they shouldn't be forced to declare.<br>  <br>  There should be more stringent regulation on the groundsmen who are preparing the wicket to produce one that will create a result.|`|AA11088802	no.. declaring of inning is the one of interesting aspect of test cricket.. as gilly's decision against england when butcher made match winning century is the best example... so leave it on team skipper and enjoy it.. yes sometime we have to forget these kind of matches which we saw recently|`|fsLMFIpgaa	Agreed it can become very tedious, but in all fairness I don't think the rule should be changed. I know Ponting grates on my nerves at times when I am sure he should declare & doesn't.|`|Qq2MKeXUaa	No, that is not cricket.|`|wPlfPc0gaa	It is time to think about forced declarations in test matches. Since timeless tests are not feasible anymore, if a test should yield a result, the captains of either teams should be forced to play for a win. Nowadays captains are too conservative and their priority is not to lose the match. Restricting the no. of overs will force captains to be aggressive in their approach to the game.<br>  Option 1: <br>  In a test match, there are about 450 overs. 6 overs will be lost due to innings changes. So effectively 444 overs remain. To be fair both side should allocated 222 overs in the match. A team can decide when to declare (if they are not bowled out before that) in the first innings between over 1 & 222. The remaining overs will be the second innings of that team. This will allow captains to explore newer strategies of tactics in test cricket. As a measure against slower over rates, the no. of overs a team failed to bowl should be deducted from their overs while batting. And if some overs are lost due to unavoidable reasons / force majeure, overs should be deducted equally from both teams allotted overs (if the match is not in its fourth innings) <br>  Option 2:<br>  Only the first innings of both teams should be restricted to 150 overs. If a team gets out within 50 overs they should be allowed to make up for it in the second innings. Alternatively, in the first innings each team should be allowed to play 5 sessions only.<br>  Option 3: <br>  Split the 444 overs into 4 equal halves. If a team is bowled out before that, the remaining no. of overs are added to the other teams innings. If team A bats first and gets out before over 111, (say 80) team B's first innings will have 142 overs. If B get out in 100 overs in their first innings, the 42 overs should be added to B's 2nd innings and so forth. This will force the bowling team to bowl well and the get the opposition out as early as possible and the batting team to be careful not to throw away their wickets.<br>  <br>  If a team maintains good overrate some extra overs could be squeezed in. These overs should be added to the final innings as batting in the fourth innings is considered to be an arduous task. Not only that, a team which thinks they'll be the one batting in the last innings will try to maintain a good overrate.

Enjoy your summer!|`|4qT0TfMZaa	We're American Civil War reenactors.

195d481e791fe6dd37323b342df9fa94aa	yeah<br>  im glad this time it was for a win|`|GswnLKtQaa	I agree!, D-wade's been on fire lately. It's a good sign! Moon also impress me.<br>  <br>  the game vs detriot was amazing d-wade was playing pg, and cook was hitting shots.<br>  <br>  D-Wade for MVP!<br>  <br>  edit: Our next game is againts the Hawks it's a must win because we can get to the 4th seed if we beat them!<br>  <br>  Let's go Heat!|`|vFbzBo4eaa	Dwayne Wade is a great player and he put 50 points career high and 15 assists career high too.He's been great and is a really MVP candidate but i would rank him as the second best player in the nba.The bets player in the nba is LeBRon James,in this thing is jus based on stats.So yeah <br>  he's on a roll|`|2eGMXYaIaa	I am not a Miami fan but D-Wade is playing great.  The problem is that the talent around him isn't very good compared to the other top teams.|`|Oes7TRNVaa	he's been my favorite player since i moved to Miami in 04'. Im not suprised at all. I really think he is the closest thing to Jordan. nobody can guard this guy NOBODY.<br>  <br>  D-WADE 4 MVP|`|aUGM3ju6aa	DWYANE WADE IS THE WORLD'S BEST PLAYER!|`|sNQrJ6cfaa	I totally agree with you!!!!!! Damn the loss in Orlando was bittersweet. The Heat lost by 23 points but D-Wade and Dwight Howard put on an incredible show. At this point you figure what is he going to give us for an encore to his 50 point career night, well nothing less than 16 whooping assist to send the struggling Pistons back to Detroit. To me D-Wade should get more merit that what he is receiving and to me he deserves a shot at the Most improved player (at least when you compare him to last year). Defensive player of the year is another good possibility. So yeah i agree with you, he is young, charismatic and on a roll!!!!|`|38f16af5e5fc1e44e0b50a5058b0ad41aa	It would impress me more if Orlando hadn't blown them out by 25|`|QmUbe395aa	yep he's a beast
u8GHTJEEaa	Good call. The Lakers DO NOT want to see the Spurs in the WCF.  The Lakers know the Spurs are the only team in the Western Conference that can take them out in a 7 game series, which this one will be.|`|bmL7Ryw2aa	I heard differently on ESPN last night.  i heard even with the Spurs completely healthy, they can only give the Lakers a scare, and the Lakers should come out victorious in 6 games.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	I don't think so that's true because Lakers are really great team<br>  They have to many weapons to win a team:Great strating line up,great bench,great shooters and great defenders|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Oh really? Now who said that? And for the record the Lakers are not afraid of anyone.|`|P93I8CHtaa	so true,they are a team that can beat us,we dont want them in the finals,plus we will be heading there|`|kFcdwVwdaa	do you believe everything you hear? the Lakers dont have any competition in the west right now. they are cruising, and bynum is injured by the way. even if we didn't have bynum, like we didn't last year and took the series 4-1, we will still have the advantage, we are bigger and more athletic than your team. besides that, we have KOBE. I think if the Spurs win on their homecourt the margin will be around 5 but when they play in L.A. its going to be a blowout. sorru to spoil your day. OH and you guys dont have "Big Shot" Rob anymore, he is the one that matters in the playoffs. you'll see, Lakers in 6|`|38634d724472d6d2e903c2fa2cae8951aa	San Antonio could easily beat the Lakers. I'm not sure if I would even call it an upset. Personally, I'd rather play the Lakers in the finals than the Spurs because I think my Celtics have a better chance against LA. Yes I know we lost twice but KG was playing with the Flu the 2nd game and the refs gave LA some really cheap calls.|`|vJyF8siJaa	Last time we played what happened? Blowout with our complete line-up. When spurs won it's only by a point. Lakers will possibly also have homecourt. Plus we beat the Spurs last year 4 games to 1. If we meet the Spurs again it's going to be the same result.|`|2Xx0Cm2Caa	I think your right about them meeting in the conference finals, they are both great teams.  I'm taking the Lakers in 7 though because of Bynum and Gasol overwhelming Duncan and wearing him down.  I also agree with your margin of victory around 5 points.|`|1AzCDrO6aa	it will be a good match but I dont think the spurs have enough to beat LA. duncan is a step slower now and manu have a lot of injury lately. LA in 6.|`|ur1bnkrZaa	i agree with eveything you said but it gunna be the lakers in 6! <br>  i have been to the future and all i see is purple and gold.|`|5b5b8e8087fb0045161251b9ffd1a88baa	I disagree in fact it's the opposite the Spurs don't want to see the Lakers in the Western finals. Lakers in 5 games|`|XLv4hhAnaa	Lakers > Spurs in the Playoff|`|aa8d66371ff46d7a821623d9f0e9c6bfaa	Well lets look at history Lakers usually lose game 4 it never fails lol it will go 2 game 5 r 6 and depending on the seat it'll be home for Lakers n where taking it even if its not home Game 5 r 6 is ours 4 the taking ...Lakers do great when Kobe does great but not all the time do they win...Lakers do AWESOME when the whole entire team does AWESOME...so in saying this if my Lakers in which I love n have much faith in will SPANK ANY TEAM ESPECIALLY THE SPURS!!! When the Lakersssssssss...play AWESOME meaning everybody including Kobe then there is no stopping the Lakers at all no questions asked...But when Odom ain't scoring like he should Pau letting the otha team push him around down on the inside when Fisher nor Farmar r making it 4rm the outside n Ariza jus lost n Kobe left 2 sink r swin then it gets hard 4 the Lakers cuz not saying Kobe won't swim cuz he usually does well but if this at all happens during the playoffs then Lakers future 2 be champs looks pretty dim. GO LAKERS!!!|`|ISQAWUf2aa	because lakers would beat the spurs easily.|`|JD5NQxeNaa	I think it will be a rematch of the 2006-2007 NBA Finals. San Antonio Spurs v. Utah Jazz. With the winner winning in the same result as that year in 7.
hMkb7H31aa	So obviously the blibla, being a free agent, got the best offer from the Indians.  Since it wasn't in the news, Boros was likely not the blibla's agent and everyone is very happy about that.<br>  <br>  The blibla will definitely help the Tribe right from the start of the season.  After having a monstrous spring training, he will lead the league in hits, doubles, triples, HR's, innings pitched, strikeouts and unassisted double plays in the field. <br>  <br>  The blibla is a living current example of what a true professional baseball player can achieve without the use of performance enhancing drugs. The blibla is a throwback player of the highest caliber.<br>  <br>  Everyone is happy for him - especially Kerry Wood, the Indian's new closer. <br>  <br>  The blibla rules.|`|EASHSCe3aa	I am not sure who that is, but the person I look to for increasing our team is DeRosa!  He will be a leader and lights out defensively and Offensively.<br>  <br>  Blibla???|`|WeEjc79Uaa	Where exactly do you come up with this stuff?|`|2ISGwSK7aa	You are annoying.
FXG0mYW9aa	No they won't because Berkman is out for a wile and they need him and Carlos Lee as a combo not just as one.|`|KR1FdEZgaa	no not at all. i think the cubs will win the central, reds will get wild card.pirates, brewers and cards. then the astros. sorry.|`|v4EKrWGFaa	They don't have enough pitching, not a chance buddy. Sorry :(|`|fQIxah8laa	Nope. But hey you never know.|`|qivUrJ3Naa	No chance they might just come in last.|`|yM8NiXmLaa	My money would put the Astros in 4th. With Berkman out for a bit and I was an opposing pitcher, that isn't a very scary lineup without Lance in there. I believe that the Cubs are the favorite, based on their depth and the many power threats that lie in that dangerous lineup and they have a solid rotation. The bullpen is their only real question mark. And I believe that the Cardinals are going to make an unexpected run and capture the wild-card. With a healthy Chris Carpenter and Adam Wainwright, that is one of the more scary 1-2 punches in the league. They have the reigning N.L M.V.P and their top prospect Colby Rasmus looks to get a starting job while moving their very good leadoff hitter, Skip Schumaker to second base. They have 5 or 6 guys with 20+ home run potential. Their bullpen has improved, so I expect the Cards to stun some people like they did last year. Then the Brew Crew, then the Stros and the Reds, who have improved a lot during the offseason, and then the Pirates.|`|CO2o0YYMaa	I think the Astros will be in the Top 4, although if they finish ahead of the Cardinals, I will be happy!|`|b30195e932765839f31a572f8d05c0f8aa	The Astros are going to have a decent team this year but I believe they come up short in a tough division.|`|BZ5z5pXqaa	yes...right below chicago..milwaukee...st louis..they should outdo the pirates and reds

JiEvzbjVaa	make sure you have a lot of power when you go int o the spin. keep your leg low first, then lift up and out. stretch your arms and leg to balance easier. try making sure your spinning leg is straightened, and point the other foot.<br>  some people think that when doing camel spins or spiral, all they need to do is bend forwards a lot, and their back leg will jut pop up. <br>  well, nope, it doesn't go like that.<br>  so practice and get the right position for the spin first, and then work on centering the spin, not leaning too forwards or backwards, and looking straight ahead.<br>  too help the spin last longer, put your arms in three position- <br>  right handed-<br>  extend left in front, right on the side<br>  change to both arms extended to the side, <br>  and then stay in the camel position, while you reach back, and grab your hand behind your back.<br>  hope this helps<br>  :)|`|lnRMmSeyaa	dont get too frushtrated, ive been stating for 6 years and camel is my worst spin so i still kinda suck at it, but if you start getting too frushtrated your spin is going to be even worse then before, so go practice spirals, and camel positions on the wall then come back and try it again.<br>  <br>  but make sure you have enough speed going into your camel so you can really push yourself around to get good speed in the spin, then bring your shoulder blades together and make sure both legs stay very straight, if your standing leg stands to bend it will make you go on a very deep inside edge and you will probably fall, just remember these key things and with some on ice help from your coach you should have your camel in no time<br>  <br>  figure skater of 6 years <3|`|akA3oJx6aa	Make sure your body is parallel to the ice. Your spinning foot should bend a lot going in, don't swing your arm around to fast. My coach taught me that when you step into it, you should be able to keep a blade guard or something that between your stomach and thigh.<br>  <br>  Once you get into the spin, slowly rise up so you don't lose your balance. Keep your weight over the spinning foot and keep your shoulders even, don't lift one up or drop a shoulder. Your arms should be stretched behind you or something.<br>  <br>  Your free leg should feel like it's stretching out, not up. Practice your camel position with a regular straight spiral. Your legs should be straight and stretched, and the free leg shouldn't be higher than your hip.<br>  <br>  I hope it helps. For more, you can ask your coach. :)

xhKQdlheaa	Just start exercising a little more to get your body prepared. Like something simple as 100 jumping jacks a day should help. Adjust it to how active you already are though. In example; If you have the time, do like, 300.<br>  And stretch, definitely stretch. A lot.

BiMkowVMaa	Durant's ceiling is so high... he has improved across the board this season and I think now the Blazer will be known for passing over Jordan and Durant for two bigs with bad wheels.<br>  <br>  Oden is no Sam Bowie and he fits the position the Blazer needed to fill, but I just think Durant is going to be a scoring champ and an offensive power house for years to come. <br>  <br>  Oden will be a really good player in time.. this is technically his first year in the league. He just needs to stay healthy and work on his post moves... his defense will be his money maker. It's too early to say he's a bust.|`|AA11488609	No.  The Blazers are looking for a complement to Roy, not a replacement.  Oden may not be a superstar in the NBA, but he'll be effective down low and they can use some help there.|`|JD5NQxeNaa	Stats may make it one sided. But, I believe Oden was the better choice and believe in a 2 sided choice. Being that a big man is a dying breed and a commodity. Blazers have their scorers they need d and Durant is not a physical player nor a multifaceted player. All he can do is score.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	No,not at all.He was the best chioce on the 2007 draft.why?Here's the deal for you.Like the first of all,Durant wouldn't fit well in the team because he's a scorer.And the Blazers will not be good for rebounding and practicly team who have great centres like:Howard and etc.Would easily defat the Blazers.<br>  <br>  So yeah,Oden was the best chioce for that draft.Because he's a great power dunker,great defender,blocker and rebounder.His defense was the key why they picked him on the draft nad the reason why he's so great and his power dunks.<br>  <br>  But you can't blaim him because he's a centre.And true centres are rare thing in the nba now.He will devolp his stats,his points,boards and blocks and other statstic are going to be improved.When he reaches that he's almost ib his top of the game.What do centres do then?Cetres like Shag,Malone and etc.Devolped their leadship skills and try to improve passing.And that's why Oden is  great but Durant is a forward and he can score,pass,steal,block,rebound,lead nad etc.His postion is giving him a chance to do more things than the C's spot.<br>  <br>  So it was the best pick from the draft because ODen is a great C and player and he will very domainting more than he's now and bettee than now.Go Oden,he'sa future superstar|`|GswnLKtQaa	No, and it's early too tell. right now the Blazers are 4th seed in the West. imagine is Roy, Aldrige and Oden were in their primes they would be title contenders.|`|KdhNCnEjaa	Yeah, I think they did, God did Danny Ainge call that one. He was probably the only GM who would have taken Durant #1 overall.|`|sNQrJ6cfaa	Honestly last year i would have told you that drafting Greg Oden was the best decision that the Blazers could have done. Durant was in a terrible team (and still is for that matter) but he was young and still inexperienced. His shot selection was not the best in the world either. Greg Oden although he was injured he still had the image as when he came out of OHIO State, the tough inside player that could be a franchise center for many years to come (Tim Duncan anybody). <br>  <br>  Things have not worked too well for Oden this year though. You can call it a mix of frustration and bad luck. His second year in the NBA has turned into another injury plagued calamity for the young center and the Trailblazers. Durant on the other hand has improved dramatically!!!! He is among the scoring leaders and will likely challenge Wade and Lebron for the scoring title. He is showing more leader like qualities and his team has been improving ever so slightly since the beginning of the season. Pair him up with another high draft pick and the Thunder could be looking at the playoffs next year in an weak eastern conference where the 6,7 and 8 playoff spots are taken by teams with less than .500 record. <br>  <br>  In the end, no question about it the Blazers have to feel frustrated with their draft choice. Greg Oden still has a lot of potential but the amount of injuries that have mounted on him is leaving me with a sour taste. Ilgauskas is the first guy that comes into my mind when i think of Oden.|`|VRnJ6aqBaa	Nope. its hard to have a big man that actually fill the middle. On that team oden doesn't need to score with th offense they have, only block shots, score a couple of baskets and rebound. he is just in his rookie year so he will be okay|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	It's a bit early to tell, but it sure looks like it more and more. Considering they already had Aldridge I can see why Portland drafted Oden.|`|0hPrhdcaaa	i dont think so but if they did, they're forgiven for making moves to get roy and aldridge instead of foye and thomas the year before|`|vzH7f7V5aa	No. They are doing fine.|`|1AzCDrO6aa	no but it looks like it will be since oden is always in the injured list.
0tpLq6meaa	Flip a coin and make your choice. Simply no difference. Both are top Quality bows. You would be happy with either.Most companies that have great success on the target ranges have great shooters that create the success the company has. Chance Beaubouef won the Las Vegas open twice shooting Hoyt's, and was hired by PSE for the express purpose of winning Las Vegas with a PSE bow, and did just that the first year he shot for PSE.|`|ZKikquiOaa	That's like saying which is better a Ferrari or an Aston Martin.  Either one will outshoot anyone alive, meaning that the limit in performance is the archer itself rather than the bow.  The determining factor boils down to personal preference.  Try both, go with what you like.  Most decent archery store will have both and will let you try them out, failing that see if any local archer will let you try out theirs.  Archers are usually very good about that as long as you ask first.<br>  <br>  Hoyt will sometimes make the argument that there has been more winner using Hoyt, well that's only because they got more money and they give away more bows to the top shooters than Matthews do.<br>  <br>  Actually, out of the recent US Olympians, Jenny Nichols shoots PSE, Khatuna shoots older model Hoyt, Butch shoots Hoyt, Vic shoots a Matthews prototype, and Brady also shoots Matthews.  If you go back further then you will see more Hoyts.  The Canadian team uses all Hoyt.  But then we're talking about recurves, which is an entirely different market than compound.  The recurve market is dominated by Hoyt, Matthews is almost nonexistant even though they acquired the Sky brand (Earl Hoyt's company after he sold Hoyt to Easton).  In the compound market, Matthews is more prevalent, and I believe the asker is talking about compounds.|`|uzNm9KtYaa	I can recall the not too distant past when Hoyt was the bow of choice for the U.S. Olympic archery team.  That's about as good a testimony to quality that I would ever need.

The booing will probably go down. But I doubt it.|`|kGXU1Dotaa	No not at yankees stadium but he will at fenway,not that it's going to bother him a few yrs ago after Arod was caught cheating with that Blond Stripper the yankees went to fenway and the fans all wore blond wigs and masks Arod goes to bat and KILLS Paplebomb with a homer that got us the win,boston fans think because they boo Arod that he gets all scared but he just answers "BIG TIME" time with his bat.They can boo all they want it won't affect Arod he's used to it.|`|6tGYe5roaa	I honestly don't think that the crowd will initially boo him. He might not get the warmest reception when he is announced Opening Day but I don't think he will get booed. However, the second he starts screwing up (not getting hits, making errors, etc.) they are really going to pile it on.|`|bVbFAyzjaa	there might be a mixture of boos and cheers, but considering how passionate and harsh yankee fans can be, he'll probably hear a lot more boos than cheers.  and he deserves it.|`|QEqGukjZaa	everyone gets booed at Yankee Stadium..but Arod will get mixed reaction|`|Y4RS35M7aa	We can only hope so.  <br>  <br>  Between the League Owners, Bud Selig, and the fans, it's hard to know who to blame and what to think about A-Rod, Maguire, Sosa, and all the other 100 abusers.  <br>  <br>  If MLB is gonna be about who gets the best steroids, then they should say so.  At least we, the fans, would know what to expect.<br>  <br>  BTW, Cubfan is correct;  steroids or not, A-rod's still a over-priced loudmouth me-first disappointment who gets booed all the time!|`|4YdbC6ekaa	Yes, and he will deserve every boo he gets.  People need to stop giving him credit for coming clean.  If not for the leak via the Mitchell Report, he would never have said a word about cheating.<br>  <br>  If the Yankees want to win a championship they should unload A-Rod.  He has proved during his entire career that no team can win with him.|`|XOtN0mzNaa	Yes.  They have booed him for other things so he will get booed about this too.  However, it will die down eventually.|`|d11198287fd025ed5755e805b28b06adaa	During the year A-Rod will be booed at the stadium. For his poor performance or a error, not for his steroids use|`|2ISGwSK7aa	Until AROD shows up in October, he will get booed.|`|AA10425091	I wonder if they will throw needle and threaten his family like with Bonds..but then again Bonds is black and does not talk to those racists media white washed scum bags...|`|AA10252869	Yes but he gets booed a lot anyway|`|cLWOtPeYaa	He probably will, he was booed at thier spring training game today. but I hope not. people are taking too much out on A-Rod.
