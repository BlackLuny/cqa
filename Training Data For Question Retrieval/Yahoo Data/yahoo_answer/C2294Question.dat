20070330083117AAaR8zA	Education & Reference;Teaching	Qualche laureato di lingua inglese che mi aiuta a risolvere questo problema grazie.?	ecco il brano:One says Mexico: one means, after all, one little town away South in the Republic: and in this little town, one rather crumbly adobe house built round two sides of a garden patio: and of this house, one spot on the deep, shady verandah facing inwards to the trees, where there are an onyx table and three rocking-chairs and one little wooden chair, a pot with carnations, and a person with a pen. We talk so grandly, in capital letters, about Morning in Mexico. All it amounts to is one little individual looking at a bit of sky and trees, then looking down at the page of his exercise book.   ecco il problema che devo risolvere: I see the following words which all have color: adobe, garden, shady, trees,onyx, carnations sky, book. look and see the picture that   DHL is painting. Which colors are there,and how do they work? Colors have textures and shapes: compare adobe and onyx, carnations and , carnations and trees. So color affects one (a reader) not only visually but also sensually. Not only what do you see, but what do you feel, physically   and emotionally? How do the colors and associated textures come   together as a composition, and to effect what in the reader?

20070422141851AA5CpRY	Education & Reference;Teaching	Bonjour ! Je cherche des témoignages de profs qui travaillent chez Berlitz. Etes-vous bien traités ?	J'ai eu dernièrement une interview chez Berlitz. Dans le specimen de contrat re?u à l'issue de l'entretien, pour examen et réflexion approfondie à domicile, avant de répondre fermement à leur offre, je vois que certains  aspects de ce contrat posent des questions et font potentiellement problème. Berlitz est une multinationale de l'enseignement des langues, avec environ 500 centres dans le monde. Leur site internet est bien s?r débordant d'auto-satisfaction, et je pense qu'il fournit très peu de témoignages francs et véritablement crédibles. Je suis un jeune prof de fran?ais, sans expérience du métier. D'une part, j'ai déjà eu, il y a des années, des échos peu flatteurs sur la manière dont Berlitz traite ses profs. D'autre part, la manière dont ce contrat est libellé laisse dans l'ombre, dans l'incertitude, certains aspects importants du métier. Je suis donc à l'écoute de tous témoignages, favorables ou critiques, sur le vécu professionnel de  (ex) profs chez Berlitz. Merci à vous

She always picks out the tiniest errors when grammar and spell check says my essay's perfect. I'll spend the longest time trying to reword my sentences so they aren't awkward, but my essay is always marked up with errors I never even knew would exist. I also lose points for not enough supporting detail, but I don't know what else to add. So, I keep doing very bad on her essays... She gives FCAs and I follow them, but it's never enough.      Also, whenever she has a test... I seem to never answer the questions the way she wants.. I either think she's asking something completely different, or I just don't get the main point of the question she's asking.   And if I /do/ answer the question correctly, she picks out random unnecessary grammar errors to make me lose points.      I'm only in my Freshman year of English, in High School. And I just don't know what to do. She doesn't give extra credit so there is no way I can bring my grade up.      Before this class, I've always done great with English, except for the occasional misinterpreting questions and awkward sentences.. I don't get why I'm doing so bad now... Help, please? I got my first C because of this class, and I'm really not happy. Is moving down a level the only thing left to do?      Please and thank you... :(

I am currently planning a series of lessons based on images in poetry and the children need to look at poems which include surreal, surprising and amusing images.

20090205144616AA5Vx5b	Education & Reference;Homework Help	What do you think of my essay?	Kuv Yog Hmong. I am Hmong. I am the daughter of six children and according to my culture, it’s a tradition to understand the concepts of a Hmong girl. I am the oldest daughter and I try to augment and expand the rules of the elders and ancestors to my younger siblings. And I am living as an American, which it has changed my perspective and attitude towards my culture, my family, and I and I’m sure it has impacted my family too.    Coming from a different background, I have to struggle living in the American way, no, in my people’s way. I have to learn to cook and cleaning, maybe a little less on cleaning since it’s common sense. But as a Christian, I am most lucky to have understanding parents when it comes to religion and when we have food parties. My parents are a little less strict about me, whether if I’m hanging with my boyfriend over at my home or that I don’t have time to come straight home from school to help babysit my one year old brother.    During the day, I go to school and stay afterschool. Mostly for honors pre-calculus so I can get help to gain more understanding of it’s sine and cosine and the unimaginable confusing calculations that I have to combine since 7th grade math. I help students who are involved with my classes, including newcomers from Thailand. I try as much as I can to explain them what the word precipitate means in Hmong during chemistry or what the instructions are. But because of the lack of Hmong in me, it’s much more complicated than it seems.     After school, I go home and babysit and clean. I can become erudite when it comes to showing my siblings that I know better, so they can know best. Its important that graduating high school is an insatiable amount of learning, you must want to know more. Wanting is somewhat a passion, so it can help you become less negative about doing things.

20090205163613AAvp2yj	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	How to discipline 5th grades when nothing works?	I am a first year teacher for 5th grade in a private Christian school. I have 19 kids in my class. I made the mistake of being too nice to them when I started teaching and smiling and just being myself. I treat kids like they are mature and talk to them in a nice manner. I am nice and friendly and joke around when I teach and such; that is just my personality. Well, the kids got too comfortable with me. They talk when I am talking and laugh and crack jokes while I am talking. They have their own conversations about things while I am talking. For instance, yesterday we were working on poems in English and talking about summer. Well, they started to talk to about summer amongst themselves, yelling back and forth to each other. Not the whole class but always the same 5 or 6 kids. And then I would say "be quiet, no one should be talking when I am talking" and it would get quiet but the very next time the same thing would happen. And then today one of the kids was making fun of retarted people. So, I told him about why you don't make fun of them and showed him a pic online. So, the whole rest of the period, he was making faces looking like retarded kids while I was turned around. Nad causing the whole class to laugh. And this sort of stuff goes on all day. I like these kids a lot and they all like me and talk to me and such after school and at lunch and all like I am their friend. Plus it doesn't help that I look extremely young and I am not a boring, strict adult, but a fun one. But, they don't treat me with repect. And it is not just me but other teachers also. Every teacher complains about my class and how bad they are. So, taking away snack doesn't help and taking away lunch recess doesn't help. Detention doesn't help and I have talked to their parents and it keeps happening. The parents sign the detention forms like it is nothing. So, the kids don't care about the punishment. Should I make them go sit in the Principal's? They are afraid of her. But this happens all day that it will be such a nusiance to have them go downstairs all day like that. Or threaten them that  they will spend the period down there if they even once act up? I am tired of telling them to stop, tired of using a chart to move names up to a punishment and tired of getting a scratchy throat yelling at them. When I yell them they obey but I heard that you should not yell. I even thought about having them write a long, three page, typed paper due the next day. What will work???What will get the respect back and discpline these kids?
