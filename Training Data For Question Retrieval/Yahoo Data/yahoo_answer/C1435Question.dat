20070507105614AADEgR6	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Warum gibt es mehr Politessen als Politeure. Liegt es in der Natur der Frau so zu sein?	Politesse ist der umgangssprachliche Begriff für weibliche Dienstkr?fte im Dienste einer Gemeinde oder einer Landespolizei (Polizeihostess [PH]). Das Kofferwort ist eine Neusch?pfung durch eine künstliche Zusammenfügung aus Polizei und Hostess und sollte wohl auch ausdrücken, dass diese Polizeihilfskr?fte h?flich für Auskünfte zur Verfügung stehen.      Sie ist in der Regel zur Ahndung von Verkehrsordnungswidrigkeiten im Stra?enverkehr, v.a. die des ruhenden Verkehrs (Parken), eingesetzt.      Politesse ist kein Ausbildungsberuf. Die Vergütung erfolgt überwiegend nach BAT VIII.      Politessen tragen zum Teil eine Uniform mit einer Kopfbedeckung im Stil der sp?ten 1960er Jahre.      M?nnliche Politessen werden üblicherweise als Hilfspolizist, regional auch als Politeur oder als Polizeiangestellter im Verkehrsdienst (Bayern) bezeichnet.

Una joven casada, abandonada por su marido excesivamente entregado a los negocios, se deja seducir y va a pasar la noche con su seductor, en una casa al otro lado del río. Para volver al día siguiente muy temprano, antes de que regrese su marido que está de viaje, debe pasar el puente. Cuando va apasar el puente, un loco se lo impide haciendo gestos amenazadores. Corre entonces a buscar a un barquero, que le pide el importe del billete. Ella no tiene dinero y el barquero rehúsa cruzar el río sin que le paguen por adelantado. Va a buscar a su amante y le pide dinero. El se niega sin dar explicaciones. La mujer va entonces a buscar a un amigo soltero que vive por alli y que le profesa desde siempre un amor platónico, sin que ella, por su parte, haya correspondido jamás. Le cuenta todo y le pide dinero. él también se niega: ella se lo ha buscado al portarse tan mal. La mujer vuelve al barquero, que se niega de nuevo a cruzar el río. Entonces decide pasar el puente. El loco la mata.      Hay que clasificar a estos personajes de más a menos según su responsabilidad. Un 1 al más culpable, un 2 al segundo, etc… y dar un porqué. Pueden responder con seriedad

20090131091113AA9PIYB	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	What good does feminism do for black women?	I hear how proud some women are of Elizabeth Cady Stanton. When in fact she was racist against black people. As it says here"   "Stanton declared, 'I will cut off this right arm of mine before I will ever work for or demand the ballot for the ***** and not the woman.' While her frustration was understandable, Stanton's position arguably helped do two things: (1) fragment the civil rights movement by pitting African American men against women, and (2) establish a basis for the literacy requirements that followed the Black male franchise. At the time, Stanton's position caused a significant rift between herself and many civil rights leaders, particularly Frederick Douglass.

20090131125716AApgMsW	Social Science;Psychology	Psychology of men in relationships?	I've been dating this guy for a few months and I really like him alot. Lately, he's been distant with me. We don't talk or spend time as frequently as we used to. We did talk about it and I told him that I noticed that he's been different. He told me that he was just really stressed about work and other things that were going on his life and that he it had nothing to do with me. Is this how men usually react in a stressful situation? Do I take his word for it? Should I forget about him? Should I just give him space? I don't want to contact him and keep asking me because I know that would push anybody away. Thanks alot for your help!

I went out to have a cig and I saw this flyer on the table.  It was like a rehab place, like for people who have drug, mental problems, and eating disorders.  I am starting to get really scared because if they make me go to this place, I am going to run away.  I would rather have bulimia kill me... ugh what should I do if my parents tell me I have to go...

20090131120650AAM3Uxs	Social Science;Psychology	Survey: Is a Cluttered House Bad for Your Mental Health?	Recently I read an article about how  a messy apartment can make you fat. I think a disorganized house (like mine!) might also make you go a little bonkers.      For the past month, I've been so busy that I've resorted to half-hearted cleaning shortcuts. We're talking quickie sweeping, a fast pass on the stove with disinfectant wipes and plenty of candle-burning and deodorizer-spritzing when guests turn up. Things got so bad the other week that I almost called a maid to clean my dinky house...lol      The most stressful thing about a messy house is that I can't concentrate. I do a lot of work from home, so when I see my unmade bed out of the corner of my eye, I get distracted from the task at hand and just think, Ugh, I need to make the bed, do laundry and hang those picture frames. On the flip side, when I come home to a tidy houset, I want to do a little victory dance--and it's much easier for me to focus.      Do you think that a cluttered house makes it harder for you to concentrate? Do you think it can even make you fat?
20090131130007AAgpVvX	Social Science;Psychology	Can someone help me with this, I am trying to convince my dad that seeing a psychologist is ok....?	What can I add to it or How should I change it?      Many of the arguments and the resulting rages, tantrums or cold shoulders that arise between people in close relationships can often be traced to differences in perception and communication style.How we see and make sense of the world around us influences how and what we communicate to others. (Sound Familiar?) This usually becomes apparent to anyone involved in a relationship with someone who has AD/HD         I know something happened with you in the past that resulted in your extremely biased (and sometimes ignorant) opinion about psychologists and psychology in general. This letter is going to clear up some of the things you may have been misinterpreted. You once said "they will say I have all these disorders, put me on anti depressants that will make me suicidal, show up on job history etc..", this could not be more opposite from the truth. The reason I want to see a psychologist is because I strongly believe I have attention deficit disorder.      Although there are no "cures" for attention deficit disorder, there are many options for treatments. None of them I can assure you will lead to other disorders, or anti depressants. These treatments involve medicine that will significantly decrease symptoms such as Ritalin, Adderall, or Concerta.

So, Susie's 13 (listen closely), and Safia JUST turned 14 in the beginning of the year, so she turns it, and throughout the year she just stays 14, however ONLY 'till August does Susie turn 14, and she STAYS 14 till NEXT year, AUGUST, so far away in the year. However RIGHT when the year changes, poor Safia DIRECTLY, once again changes age, turning 15.. while Susie is only the "little 14", and turning 15 with time, EIGHT whole months later...      THIS IS SO NOT FAIR!!! :((   I'm really pis   ssed off........ Am I actually AHEAD of age?? I need to do some thinking.. you know how BAD it sucks if I am??

The dream started off at my house, and I was with two other boys. I know the boy who raped me very well. We used to like each other, or we still do. I don't know the other boy well at all, I've never talked to him before in my life, but I do know who he is and that they are both friends.      The boy I don't know very well distracted me. He found ways to get me into my room by myself. Once he accomplished that, the boy I do know very well came into the room and raped me.    Even though I may have feelings for him in reality, in that dream I didn't want to know him at all. I woke up frightened. In my dream I was frightened. I didn't know what to do. I felt so helpless.      The next day I saw him and everything was fine. We talked like we did before and I gave him a hug.    I don't know if this dream means anything, but I am going to be careful when im around him, especially if its just us..alone.      Before this dream happened, we did talk about being sexually active. I will admit that. But now I don't want to at all. Im scared that something bad could actually happen; like my dream.       I don't know what to do or think.   Help!

I was just curious if the same results were observed, prospectively, in young ladies.      Thank you.

I have seen this countless times where these Feminists use space to engage in such conversations irrespective of whether they have addressed the question being asked.

20090131142259AAZzxtI	Social Science;Economics	Economics questions (macroeconomics)?	1)  http://img522.imageshack.us/img522/9499/...    An aggregate demand shift from AD 0 to AD 1 can be caused by       a) an increase in the price level.    b) a decrease in the price level.    c) a decrease in government spending.    d) an increase in money supply.      I'm pretty sure this would be an increase in the price level, but I wanted to make sure.      2) Coal is used as a source of energy in many manufacturing processes. Assume a long strike by coal miners reduced the supply of coal and increased the price of coal. This would cause       a) the short-run aggregate supply curve to become nearly vertical at all levels of output.    b) the short-run aggregate supply curve to become flatter.    c) the short-run aggregate supply curve to shift to the right.    d) the short-run aggregate supply curve to shift to the left.      3)  http://img105.imageshack.us/img105/4073/...       Suppose the equilibrium output is $600 billion, an expansionary monetary policy __________ equilibrium output and __________ the price level.       a) leaves unchanged; increases    b) increases; decreases    c) increases; increases    d) decreases; leaves unchanged   I know what a monetary policy is, but I'm not sure what an expansionary monetary policy is and if it would affect the answer or not.      4)  http://img222.imageshack.us/img222/462/i...

Out of noware the idea that "what if this world isnt real" pops up and you spend days, weeks thinking about this.   You come up with all sorts of ideas, getting scarier as time goes on.       With each "realisation" (Robots didnt create the world, I did and I'm the only one in it, no one else is real) You feel physical sensations that seem to back up the authenticity of this.      Question is: Is it possible for someone to make up very elaborate "therories" based around one idea.       And can the body create sensations based on scary thoughts?      Dont become concerned, this isnt about me. I cant say who is going through these things but I am interested in these answers.      Yes i asked this alot, but no one replies to it.
