I think  you want it a bit bunched right? Anyway pull around to see how tight you want it. Better to cut bigger and take in later. If you want them to wear under pants, I'd take a old sweater , cut off the sleeves if they fit on your legs and stitch those up. Your fabric lady should know how to sew also, ask her.

YaeG1cjhaa	http://hort.ufl.edu/shrubs/ALOBARA.PDF  Looks like your aloe is good to go in almost any soil acid to slightly alkaline, clay to loam. pH should be 5.6-7.5 and the only thing that you should really avoid is salinity as it is not very salt tolerant. If your water is alkaline you might want to use RO or distilled. The good news is that salt is leach-able and if you are planting in sandy soil it is fairly easy to get rid of salts without increasing the threat of root rots which usually appear on those grown on limestone soils.|`|AA11498082	Agree with Arcto.

There are more than one type of pH meter, for liquids (hydroponic) and for substrates as soil.    There are also a lot of nutrients to make the soil able to increase yield.    You can find this equipment and much more directly on www.hydroponics.eu    Good luck!

0z8Ek5d1aa	Assuming it is bare metal....    Clean it  and prime it with an oil primer first.    If it gets a lot of sunlight, use a rust inhibitive acrylic (latex) paint for better gloss and color retention than an oil.  If it does not get heavy sunlight and rust is a higher concern, go with an alkyd (oil) topcoat over the primer.     I would use the same paint for both sides.  A lot of metal paints are interior/exterior anyway.|`|3eb0DIxGaa	Latex will work fine. The same exterior paint can be used on the interior.

N4IvZmPiaa	First off...When you say you burnt off 20% in the propane tank, are you looking at the guage on the tank and seeing 80%? If so you've used very little fuel so far. We only fill tanks to a maximum of 80 or 85% to allow room for ther propane to "grow" as temperature changes...We never fill them to 100%.    As to the furnace installation... There a lot of installers out there, but most of them work with Natural Gas on an everyday basis, but only do propane work rarely, if at all. You should always ask contractors if they work with propane regularly before you hire them to service or install propane equipment. There are definite differences in the installation that they might miss.     The installer should have known pretty quickly when they fired the furnace the first time that something was wrong. The flame was probably very yellow and lazy. That is why it created so much soot. The flame should be blue. They should have seen by the rating plate on the appliance what fuel it was set up for and known that the conversion kit had not been installed. As to the valve being "off a little bit"...if they followed the proper setup procedure it would have been correct the first time. A valve doesn't go out of adjustment by itself. It sounds like this guy didn't know how to check and set the regulator pressures correctly. On a natural gas system you only have to adjust the pressure at the appliance. On a propane system you have to check and adjust the tank regulator, the second stage regulator at the wall and THEN the appliance gas valve. I doubt he did that.    I would suggest you have someone competent clean the furnace and inspect the entire installation to make sure it meets code requirements and is safe. Then take that bill and call a meeting with your original installer to discuss the situation and see if he's willing to refund you any of your money for unnecessary service calls. If it doesn't go well, I would make a subtle comment that he left an unsafe installation in operation and put you and your family at risk. That might shake his pursestrings open a bit...    Good luck with it!    EDIT: It is NOT your fault that the appliance wasn't converted! It is up to the installing technician to check that. They are supposed to be the PROFESSIONAL that was hired by the (forgive me!) uneducated consumer who doesn't know any better. The installer should never have connected the fuel to the appliance if there was any suspicion that it was not converted and safe to use for that fuel.|`|ww12lItvaa	It wa terribly illegal for the first guy to have hooked up a natural gas furnace to propane without the conversion having been done.     Document everything and sue him for all costs. You have a very strong case... except over the mouse nest.     He actually put you in danger. Although you did say it was a propane furnace and it wasn't. It was a natural gas furnace that can be converted. But it was his job to know the difference.    Here, we have the propane supplier do all conversions.|`|QomVD1ceaa	You should report him to your local building code inspector. Then i would sue him. Your lucky your house did not blow up. N/G runs a higher pressure 11 inches water column  Propane runs at 7iwc.|`|GaLw1qMwaa	they 1st technician was ok for charging 3 out of 5 times.  however, he should have known that not having the correct orfices would result in too much soot.   if he told you that would happen PRIOR to install then yea its your fault.  but if he didnt then he needs to fix the problem free of charge.    i personally wouldnt have paid him more than twice. after that i would have gotten a second opinion.    so call him up ,act professional and tell him whats going on and that you feel he should clean it free of charge considering you have paid him more than once.   if he refuses go to small claims court or go to the local newspaper.    if he is smart he cares more about his good name then a few hundred bucks. but please realize he needs to make a living but it does need to be an honest living.    Next time before you hire a HVAC tech ask them if they warranty their work and for how long. that way if you have to call them back within the warranty period you dont have to pay additional!
AA12289981	If there is carpet, this may be where the odor comes from.  Carpet and other fabric-y things notoriously hold smells forever.  You could try shampooing the carpet.  Or better yet buy a big box of Borax (laundry detergent) and sprinkle it all over the carpet (seriously), then stomp all over it to get it really far into the carpet fibers (seriously), let it sit for a good long while, then vacuum it up.

eatd3s42aa	The tankless water heaters have filter screens at the cold water inlet and they need to be cleaned occasionally. Another option is to install a tank type water heater after the tankless unit , this will act as a holding tank for the already heated water and that water will be hot as soon as it gets to the tap. The tank heater will not kick on as much as the water coming in is already heated|`|QomVD1ceaa	I have one of these. Your tank might be to far from your faucet.|`|jaHkY4Rbaa	Try insulating all exposed hot water pipes.    It sounds like the tankless heater is quite distant from your application.    The money you supposedly save with a tankless heater is being wasted when it is installed too far away.    Personally, I do not understand how a tankless system is more efficient than a tank of maintained hot water.      In a gas system, I would assume too much heat would escape up the chimney, because the flame has to be fast and furious.
5d9034dca457ea37161d033c4b4a434eaa	Go with a large company like Brinks or ADT. They are reliable.    Most places offer deals like free activation of an existing system or $100 install for a new system. Both usually mean you have to sign a 2-3 yr contract.    There are many levels of alarm systems. A basic one would monitor the main doors for opening and have glass breakage sensors. More advanced systems monitor each window for opening and also have motion detectors.    Some systems even have cameras, and let you log in on the Web and check on your house.    Expect to pay from $25-$75 per month for monitoring.    Use common sense when specing out your system. In other words, don't pay extra for window sensors on second floor windows that would be hard for a burglar to get to. One exception would be if you had a toddler. This way you would hear a chirp if they opened their window!    I have Brinks and have been satisfied.|`|pjGueC4xaa	ADT is the way to go!  Both my homes are protected by them.

FlsrXuJOaa	I don't have experience personally growing one, however I do have some info on them. I work at a retail nursery and we do not carry them for the following reasons:     -grafted plants can often times be less sturdy than non-grafted so they can be more prone to break at the graft point during an ice/heavy wind storm.     -the biggest reason is that most fruit trees are prone to a lot of bug/pest/disease problems. When there is just one fruit type to deal with, they are easier to control, but when there are several different fruit varieties on one tree, you will constantly have to spray for pests and diseases.     hope this helps. they are definitely cool, and if you are willing to deal with the possible downsides, I would still say they are worth a shot. the worst that can happen is that they won't work out. also, you probably won't find one a a retail nursery, so you might have to go through a catalog. good luck!

ivKcxwUqaa	For phalaenopsis, at our nursery we use 2 parts bark, 1 part perlite, 1 part hygromite, and 1 part chopped sphagnum moss. Pop the plant out of it's pot and clean the roots off. Cut away any papery or mushy roots. You can put it back in the same pot or in a slightly bigger one depending on the state of the roots. Put a little mix in the bottom then the plant. You don't want to bury it any deeper then it was in the original pot. Fill in around the roots. Water by soaking it in your sink to the level of the pot with a diluted (quarter strength) 20-10-20- Orchid fertilizer (you can up this to full strength after your plant adjusts to the new food). You will need to water more often with the new bark until it starts to break down. Plastic pots keep the most moisture, terracotta dries out quickly. To disguise a plastic pot, and conserve moisture, slip it into a larger pot without holes in the bottom.|`|36a3ynpJaa	Orchids are epiphytes so they normally live in a bark medium.  You should be very careful about fertilizer though since they will burn easily.    They should be repotted when they become root bound and the roots start to come out of the bottom of the pot.  Usually before that there will be suckers that can be transplanted to make new plants.|`|bEoiVqa7aa	Repot phalaenopsis right after blooming when new roots are beginning to show.

"Seedless" watermelons are hybrids that are formed from crossing two different types of watermelons, one of which has the tendency to not produce seeds.  The cross produces a watermelon with seeds, but those seeds when planted then do not have the ability to produce seeded fruit.  Get it?  Actually, when you buy a packet of seedless watermelon seeds, there are a few regular watermelon seeds in the packet too.  You have to have at least one of these plants growing along side the seedless plants for cross pollination.  It is all rather complicated, isn't it?|`|J4l00elBaa	I dont know thats a good question! 
gwK4jolhaa	If your DRAIN lines are  ABS or PVC ,(plastic),this is simply a matter of expansion and contraction of the line.  It heats up or cools down depending on hot or cold water.As it expands and contractsit is probably moving against an unlike surface.  For instance often times holes have to be drilled in wood members in order to get the pipe where it needs to go.The pipe is ran through the holes and does come in contact with the wood.Hence rubs against the wood.  This is most likely what you are hearing.  No need to be alarmed.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	There's a troll in there and he's complaining 'cause the water's too cold...poor l'il guy.

The contractor did a lousy job fastening the pipes inside the walls.|`|G4TJ8nibaa	Considering that water hammering doesn't occur when water is flowing AND it is a supply side problem (NOT a drainage problem) I doubt that could be the problem you are having. A knocking sound on the drain side  usually indicates a leak. Its the water dropping on a hard surface. Not being able to hear the sound this is only a guess. But see if you can isolate where the noise is coming from and check that area (up & down) for dampness.  Good Luck!

Turn the blinds around to vacuum dust from the other side. Don't press too hard or you'll dent the blinds.   Step2Use an anti-dust spray and a dry cloth as an alternative to a vacuum. Or place a towel underneath your blinds and use a damp cloth and a multi-purpose household cleaner for aluminum blinds.   Step3Take your blinds outside to clean heavy dirt accumulation. Place a drop cloth underneath them and hose them down. Use a soft cloth or sponge with a mixture of water and multi-purpose cleaner for tough dirt stains. Turn your blinds over and clean the opposite side. Rinse off any soap or cleaner with your hose and allow them to dry.   Step4Put your blinds in a bathtub filled with warm soapy water if you can't clean them outside. Soak them for roughly half an hour, wipe them off and hang to dry. Make sure you don't bend your blinds or scratch your bathtub.   Step5Clean both sides of your wooden blinds with a soft, dry cloth and wood cleaner.   Step6Dust fabric blinds with a light vacuuming, using your hose attachment. To remove dirt, use warm water and a mild laundry detergent. Blot heavily stained areas rather than rub.

Do the dishes, clean counters and tables. Pick up the random clutter around the rest of the house. If you're going to dust, do it before you do the floors.     In your room, first thing is make your bed. You can use it to sort stuff on it. Second, put clean clothes away. Then handle the rest of the clutter.    In the bathroom, put your cleaner on the toilet and then clean the rest of the bathroom. This way, the cleaner has time to sit on the diiirty toilet before you clean it.    Don't forget to sweep and vacuum, if you have the time/energy go ahead and mop too. Do the floors last though, this way if you've knocked anything on the floor when doing the counters/tables or dusting, you can vacuum it up. Also, since you've already picked up the random clutter, you don't have to pick stuff up as your vacuuming.    Make it fun and dance while you're cleaning!!! It'll go by in a flash and your mama will super happy.    Hope it helps! :D|`|wstEJRofaa	I don't like cleaning either, but it's what I do for a living and what I do when I get home from it :/    I clean around 4 houses a day ... it's tough but I still do it.

qGlMX67eaa	wow that is cool! my venus flytrap died yeah, it was sad, but the part i forgot was the rainwater and sunlight|`|wLADk4OPaa	Any size tank will do.  But make shure that you only use  [rain water] because the slittest   hint of clorine will kill your plants.|`|oIRLs6Spaa	You should really consider growing your carnivorous plants outdoors.  Typically carnivorous plants are difficult to keep alive in terrariums.    I am more knowledgeable about growing Venus Fly Traps, but Sundews, Pitcher Plants and Butterworts all have similar growing requirements.    There are really only 4 things Venus Fly Traps (and most carnivorous plants) require to stay healthy:  1) Sunlight - at least 4 hours of direct sunlight a day  2) Water - rain, distilled or reverse osmosis water only  3) Soil - Nutrient poor soil such as peat moss  4) Dormancy - Venus Fly Traps require a 3-4 month dormancy period during the winter    Venus fly traps like lots of light. Try to give it at least 4 hours of direct sunlight a day. The more you can give it the better. It is best to grow your fly trap outside where it can get plenty of sun and catch its own food. You don't actually have to feed a Venus Fly Trap anything other than sunlight and water. If you do choose to feed it, don't over do it. Feed it only insects and at most only a couple a month.    Venus fly traps need clean water. Usually tap water will not do. It is best to use distilled water, rain water, or reverse osmosis water. Venus fly traps need water with a TDS (total dissolved solids) measurement of 50 ppm (parts per million) or less. In order to get this, you probably need to use distilled water or reverse osmosis water or rain water. Their soil should be kept wet at all times except during the winter when it should be just moist. It is best to use a tray and set the plant in an inch or two of water.    If you need to repot, for soil you can use a combination of peat moss and perlite. Most growers use a 50:50 mix of peat moss and perlite. I have been leaning toward using pure peat moss lately. Venus Fly Traps aren't picky, but be sure to use some form of peat moss or sphagnum peat moss with perlite or vermiculite to ensure that the media is nutrient poor.    Without a winter dormancy period, your plant's health will start to decline and it will eventually die. You can read more about dormancy here:  http://www.flytrapcare.com/venus-fly-tra...    If you have any more questions, you can join the forum on my site and ask them there:  http://www.flytrapcare.com/phpBB3/

PaisCoq5aa	go to your local home depot, they sell 24"x24" sheetrock panels, cut the punch out into an even square, for example take a knife and cut the holes in the wall to even dimensions, for example 8"x8". Than put scrap pieces of wood inside the wall, halfway covering the existing sheetrock behind it. Than put screws into the sheetrock so they hit the wood and hold it up temporarily. than place your cutout piece into the whole, and screw it into those wood scraps you earlier placed in. Than using joint cement, i recommend the premixed 1 gallon bucket of joint cement for homeowners, skim a think coat onto the gaps and than put joint tape over the seams. Let that dry. than place a second coat but this time feather it out well past the repair spot that way once it is painted it doesn't look like a hump on the wall. At this point after it drys, sand it using a sheetrock sander, regular sandpaper will clog up. if necessary apply a 3rd thin coat feathering out even farther. Than sand, after this be sure to apply primer before you paint, trust me, this way the paint will not bleed threw, also take a piece of old paint off wall and go to home depot for a paint match. and prime and paint and your all set. good luck|`|V9HNzXFuaa	Sounds like your husbands bad temper needs fixed more than the holes in the wall...|`|4z0Rk4Ddaa	If the wall is made up of drywall yes you can fill in the holes with plaster and then sand it down than paint the wall the same color as the rest of the room.

Using a scrap of drywall works best, as it will be flush with the rest of the wall once you are complete.     Materials:  Scrap of drywall  Lightweight spackling compound.  2" putty knife (plastic)  several wood sticks, such as paint stiring sticks  Wood Glue.  Knife or saw for cutting drywall.  Wall color paint to match  paint brush.    1. Glue some sticks accross the hole, to the backside of the drywall. This will give you something to  glue the new drywall patch to. Let the gue dry.    2. Cut a piece of drywall to the size of the hole, and glue it over the opening, to the sticks you installed in step 1. The patch doesn't have to fit perfectly, you can have quarter inch gaps or so around the edges.    3. Get some lightweight spackle, and spread this over the patch, filling in the cracks around the edges of the hole. Let this dry. Smoothe it out with a putty knife.    4. Get a can of spray texture, and spray lightly over the patch. The nozle on the cans needs to be adjusted to match the texture on the wall. Practice on some cardboard till you get close to the same look as the wall.    5. Paint to match the wall color.

If you are keeping one as a pe,t make sure to provide it with a dark place to hide.|`|CZfUO2kcaa	I don't think so. Moles are made for underground living. 1. Nearly blind 2. Huge claws for digging through soil 3. Diet of earthworms and grubs 4. Super sensitive nose, though not for smelling, for feeling. Their noses are like our fingertips, used for feeling their way around their environment. The ground stays at a pretty constant temperature, so I don't think that moles have the ability to survive in temperatures that swing to the extremes, also sunlight hurts their eyes.    A mole may come out of the ground if it is sick, but a mole on the surface is not normal and should be dispatched, as it may have diseases or rabies or fleas, or all three and more!

You can literally spend hours:  http://www.sherwin.com/visualizer/    I think "vanillin" (  6371) above the chair rail & "muddled basil" (  7745) below it might be a good choice.

If you didn't want linoleum, look into tile, BUT keep in mind that tile will always be cold to stand on even in hotter climates.  If you do go the tile route, then splurge and get in floor heating.  To expensive?, then get hardwood.  If you want something different, look into cork.  Soft and warm to stand on, extremely durable and friendly to the environment.    Good luck!

Of course, you could store boxes of soap, razors etc. in a mirror-fronted cupboard, which look good, and hide everything away, while still keeping them close by.
AA10283947	I am so glad that you asked this question, the billing system in the UK is a stitch-up for the ordinary punter.  The Ofgen people say you can easily switch but it is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT as there are so many tariffs being bandied about that you would need to be a full time lawyer on nights to make any headway through the maze.  If they or the Government really wanted the people to get fair priced energy they would make THE TARIFFS universal through-out all suppliers so that we the customers could start from a level playing field, never mind the over complication of EASY swap, we need to know about what we are swapping into and at what clearly defined true  cost.  My local shop charges me for a pint of milk not the first gill at such a price and the second gill at another price, a pint is what I ask for and that is what I pay for and it is easy to see which shop is charging more for milk that it's' competition.  I worked in the Energy industry for many years and I fortunatley can do the sums, but I do wish I and others had no need.  OFGEN get of your arrse.|`|HBK9aIhxaa	If you don't have a standing charge, For example, Scottish Power "no daily service charge plan" youll pay a higher rate for the first 1143kWh used each quarter, then a lower rate for any other energy you use.    Usually this information is printed on your bill, otherwise you can ask your supplier for a breakdown of charges.    Gas retail prices in the UK have nearly doubled in the last 3 years and are still very expensive. The increase in gas prices has not been due to gas supply or demand, rather than the ability of gas suppliers to control and set prices according to the world price of crude oil|`|oKFAt7Lsaa	You need to know what sort of account you have with your gas supplier.Some people are on economy 7 or other pricing plans where the first say 500 units are charged at one price and any subsequent units are charged at another tariff.

d9f5eef57376876109b9a113a7c9af2eaa	The kind of mulch will not affect the tree surviving.  A newly planted tree's biggest issue is watering.  They usually die from not getting enough water, or drowning from an over-enthusiastic waterer.  And established tree generally needs to extra water outside of regular rainfall, but a newly planted one does not have an established root system yet, and will need assistance for the first 6-12 months.    Mulch is used to keep down weeds, retain soil moisture, and the color chosen is purely aesthetic.  The tree doesn't care what color the mulch is.    And most dye mulches are dye with plant dyes - they are not an issue for the plants.|`|Yfjh3kBAaa	Dye coloring doesn't make a difference, the tree will live.  What causes the tree to die is if you mulch incorrectly.  You should only apply 2-3" of mulch.      Mulch not only protects the roots by reducing soil compaction, but it also keeps mowers/weed-eaters/and humans away from the root zone.  It also helps in slowing down water, and filtering it smoothly into the soil.|`|a2ce1097a86fb1054145f9a23192a355aa	If a newly planted tree dies, it is not because of the mulch, no matter what color the mulch is.    The most common cause of death would be improper planting.  When you bring a plant home from the nursery, it must be planted at the same depth it was planted in the nursery container.    Mulch is used to make the planting look more attractive, to cut down on the number of weeds that will grow in the mulched area and to help hold in moisture.  When it's really hot outside, the mulch also shades the ground and keeps the soil and roots cooler.|`|eBGGXGBxaa	I have used red mulch in my garden and did not have any problems with it.

XBasaB72aa	That depends!!!  Let's explain what is involved in Dumpster Pricing.    Rates for Dumpster vary greatly across the US and even across local Counties. There are two big pieces: landfill costs and Local Municipalities. Landfills charge by the Ton or in some cases by the Yard. The "tipping" charge (to tip the contents of a Dumpster into the landfill) varies greatly from one part of the country to another. But, did you know that the type of Waste also makes a huge difference? Most Dumpster Rental companies do not want you to know this "dirty little secret" (pun intended). Let us help you get the lowest possible cost by proving you the right type of Dumpster Rental at DumpsterSource.com. Municipalities also come into play. Some have special fees and taxes associated with Trash Disposal. Others have "Franchised" their area creating a fixed price with a monopoly hauler. Yet others compound this problem with the need for Special Permits to rent or place a Dumpster Rental. It can be very confusing so call 1-888-423-8677 for help with Dumpster Rentals.    Of course the Dumpster Rental Size also affects Pricing. Larger dumpsters cost more because they hold more tonnage. Tonnage is a large part of a Dumpster Rental. You pay for the amount of tons or yards you dump (or tip). Larger Dumpster Rentals also require a little more fuel to truck around. Fuel Service fees are now common practice across the US. We at DumpsterSource.com negotiate the best possible rates for Fuel Fees and Environmental Fees.    How Does DumpsterSource Price Rolloff Dumpster Rentals?  DumpsterSource prices Dumpster Roll-off Container Rentals several ways. Typically we charge an "all-in" flat rate for each container type. This avoids hidden charges or fees that the typical homeowner may not thinkto ask about. Call us and we'll talk it all through with you! Or visit out site at www.DumpsterSource.com to check for pricing and schedule online.    Let's get back to the biggest driver of Dumpster Rental Pricing: Tonnage. Most Dumpster Rentals will have a Tonnage Allowance (see DumpsterSource.com for details). We set the Tonnage allowance based on tons of experience (get it?). The typical job will not exceed the tonnage allowances, but, sometimes they do. Let's look at the process to understand what happens: every Dumpster crosses an Official Scale (State Monitored) on their way to the landfill or transfer station. If your Dumpster Rental weighs more than your max allowance then extra tonnage charges will apply. Let me give you an example. Take our most popular Container the 30 yard Dumpster. Lets say the "All in" price is $450 with a 4 Ton Allowance. And in this case extra tons are $50 a ton. If your Dumpster crosses the Scales at 3.987 tons then your Price remains $450, however, if it crosses the Scales at 5.1 tons then you owe 5.1-4=1.1 ton at $50/ton or $55 additional to cover the overage. Confusing? Not too hard to figure out. What is more important is that you get the right container in the first place! Depending on your job type and the type of debris you have DumpsterSource.com will help you select the right type of container for your job. Ask us about Specialty Containers such as Shrub and Brush or Metal Recycling or Concrete. If you have special waste type like Concrete you need a Specialty Container. We will help you choose the right Dumpster Rental - 1-888-423-8677 or dumpsters@iws.com.|`|pjGueC4xaa	$ 375 for a 15Y, just rented one this week, cleaning out mother-in-laws house.  This is the best way to go.  They will take everything from old paint cans to refrigerators and A/C units.    If you put the dumpster were it is visible from the street (driveway) you may actually luck out and have someone stop bye looking to see if your throwing out anything metal.  This happened to me, a couple of guys in a van were looking for any scrape metal and actually crawled into the dumpster to pull out what they saw.  This made more room for me.      If you have to put the dumpster in the street you are required (in most towns or cities) to get a permit.    The outfit I rented the dumpster from said I could have it for 5 days.  And you can't load over the side-walls so make sure you get the right size for your needs.|`|Vl4ZLrf5aa	I recently finished up a construction project using an assortment of dumpsters. Let me share my experiences :)    First of all, what's good and reusable should be listed on freecycle.com. People will gladly haul off all that usable stuff because it's free....this will save you buckets of money since you now won't have to pay to throw this stuff out.     What's recyclable should be recycled too....paper, cardboard, plastics, glass, wood etc. Most cities will pick up all that recycling at no charge as well...or you can toss it into the back of a pickup truck and drive it to the center yourself. Plus, you might even earn some cash for the stuff you take in :)    Getting to the trash: A 3 yd dumpster costs about $15 to have delivered, 20 a day to '"rent" and $20 to dump. A 30 yd dumpster costs about $350 to have delivered and dumped. Getting the smaller dumpster and having it dumped every day is cheaper than rent than a bigger one ~ and if you can divert the recycling, then the cost goes down even more.|`|60db7e648583c2d8bbd2fc79bd2f0368aa	A "roll off" dumpster would probably be best. The 6yd and 8yd dumpsters are normally rented by the month. I believe they rent them by the day and then they also weigh them. Not sure. I've had them here where I work, but I don't remember the exact cost. Also....Be aware of where they will drop it.

Such as dry-rot, excessive spanning (meaning the builders exceeded the minimum length without proper support)...  Grading is also a factor.  Structural lumber, which is wood used for supporting loads such as a floor, should be stamped "structural or better."  It may be the builders cut some corners and settled for   " 2 or better" graded lumber.  Check the stamp...

XgOIlU0eaa	i'll assume that the blower motor in the indoor unit [ air handler]  always runs when it should...its the outdoor unit fan motor thats the problem??..if so,,likely it needs a new motor..even if the capacitor was bad,likely the motor had run hot for a long time [weeks,months],,the difference between a heat pump in heating season and cooling season is that in cooling season,you will notice a problem soon after it begins due to no cooling,or noticable drop in cooling...in the heat mode,heat pumps arent very good heaters anyway,can be tough to distinguish between a heat pump thats working ok but struggling with the cold outdoor  temps, and a heat pump with a problem..therefore that motor is probably bad due to running all that time with a bad capacitor...motors fail in different ways..just because it turns freely with power off doesnt mean the windings are ok...as long as the capacitor is good,a motor that doesnt start up and get to speed quickly after being energized is bad...if it does start up and sound ok at 1st,it might be overheating after running a while...basically,as long as it has power and capacitor is good, [ and correct uf],there is no excuse for is not to be able to run for hours at a time,esp if its cold outside,which should help keep it from overheating...so go ahead and replace the motor if you know how...be sure to get same rpm and = or slightly greater horsepower..also be sure that new capacitor is the correct microfared [uf] for the new motor..if it isnt,then you will have to replace it with correct one for the new motor.........dan|`|Jy15drCtaa	Without even knowing what unit you have, your issue is not unknown, nor is it unusual. The Capacitor is certainly not your problem. Your course/heat interchange is. It is called many different things, depending on where you are located, but the unit is always the same.     This is the device that tells your unit when to operate, and at what capacity. Usually, this issue is caused by a faulty stat (thermostat). Or, and more importantly, someone either adjusted the programmable settings or heat intelligence program (unit specific) to your system.     My money is on a faulty thermostat. Most programmable units can be corrected without even spending a dime. Write to me, tell me what you currently have (both unit and thermostat wise) and I will present you with a generally simple solution. If, however, after hearing all that you might say, I might come to a conclusion that you may not be happy with, but one that is likely necessary.  So please don't yell at me for being honest.     BUT, My money is still on the simple and inexpensive solution.|`|Ncu1wJU4aa	Heat pumps are a bit complicated to be able to walk you through a trouble shooting procedure.

pffEqA9aaa	Having another person's home attached to yours (on the top or any other side) helps to "insulate" your home from the temperature swings of nature.    The type of insulation you're talking about is put into the walls and ceilings to act as a buffer between your home and nature (helping to keep the sun's heat out and also the furnace heat in during the winter)...  and yes, many rentals don't have enough insulation.|`|3W18HDxxaa	yes   they do skimp on insulation  in the roof and every where else,    all the new units i have worked on  are poorly made
AVzQs5Uhaa	depends on the bed, most beds you just get these wooden slants that they sell i guess its there versionof a box spring that you don't need one. I bought my bed frame there (the head and foot board, and what the mattress and box spring sit on that's a complete frame). You buy the whole frame like head board,foot board,legs and frame that the box spring and mattress sits on. You have the option of purchasing the slats as your box spring and putting your mattress  on that ,which to me doesn't seem so stable or purchasing a mattress and box spring separately and not using the slants(that's what i did, it gives more comfort and support) this  is the bed that I purchased : http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/produc...    that is considered the frame with out the mattress and mattress topper that they have one there. Hope this helps, oh I forgot to mention that you also have to get whats called amid beam for the bed its like this piece of metal that goes from the head to the foot of the bed down the center and is like this thick expandable piece of metal it also give support to the bed and mattress and  it  is usually  included in the price. if you are able to go  into the ikea store I would suggest it because their employees are more then willing to help you with what you would need to get. The bed pictured above was the bed that i had purchased and  it took me all of maybe 15 to 20 mins to put together.
jLP6cZBPaa	Basting stitches-a loose temporary sewing stitch to hold layers of fabric together until it is sewn in the seam.  They are either hand or machine sewn to hold your  pleats in place before the seam is sewn.    Topstitching -To sew a row of stitching close to the seam or edge of (a garment) on the outside of the fabric.  After you sew the waist band on the skirt place a row of straight stitches on the outside of the waist band close to the seam.  Look at a ready to wear skirt and you'll be able to see what it looks like.  Good luck.|`|e248fbf4bda3b339c8800122c1551870aa	The raw edge is where the material was cut, basting across it means you're putting a simple straight stitch to keep the cut ends from fraying.    Top stitching the pleat means you are sewing the pleats together across the top so that the pleats stay pleated.

QNGzjvRKaa	If I understood correctly you will be removing the downspout from the sewer line and need to seal up the sewer line...right?  Plumbing supply / home center sells an item used to seal a leak/crack in you pipe...should work for you.  You need to know what size your pipe is; I'd guess a 3 or 4 inch line.  The kit consists of a rubber gasket and two clamps.  Put the rubber part over the area to be sealed and put the clamps on - one at each end.  Tighten up and your pipe is sealed.  Of course you will need to do something with the downspouts also.  Try to extend them away from the foundation of the house as much as possible to fight infiltration of water to your basement.|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	Go to Home Depot and get the roll up plastic ends that fit over the downspout, it keeps them out of the way when it's not raining and allows the water to slowly seep into the grass or surrounding areas.|`|3W18HDxxaa	Info Info    so the down spots run to the sewage pipe ?  what is the ?    are you wanting to seal around them  where they enter the pipe ?   or remove them from the pipe ? and seal  the opening ?   use a Silicon caulking or foam|`|vl6OtBfWaa	If you seal the downspouts they will fill with water when it rains wont they?    You can dig a hole in the ground 3 feet deep 24 inches in diametre and fill it with pea gravel and route the downspout into it.  The water will drain into the water table that way.    Dont be too small on the size of your hole you dig,  too small and you will just flood your grass in heavy rain.|`|Qtdm5q9jaa	i suggest u buy a inspection cover to put in place of the removed downspouts .

v3xEtuLLaa	This should take him about a day to complete.  If you pay him $300 for the labor, along with the price of materials, you will still be coming out ahead.

Hope this helps.|`|2f9824f26c5c0aff862cb30b3373b9a3aa	You would be getting a good deal and if the guy is reliable it will be a quick job unless there are complications.  Most states will let you do a panel change out and the fee is between 75 and 100 dollars for the permit so I could see the whole thing costing you 500 dollars for parts and labor.  Pretty good price considering electrical contractors usually go for around 60 to 80 dollars an hour.|`|AA10263113	Since all the wiring circuits in the house already exist, I don't see why you would need more breaker spaces than you now have. You don't need more breakers unless you are going to split up some of the existing circuits into two or more, or add new circuits.  The melting was caused by poor connection of the breakers to the box which caused the contacts to overheat. The breaker may still be ok, unless its external contacts are deformed or excessively corroded.  Depending on how old the box is, it may be difficult to find one compatible with the circuit breakers you now have. Try to find a box identical to what you have and use as many existing breakers as you can. make sure they are properly seated in their connector and the cover is properly installed.     Get the manufacturers part number and look it up on the Web to get a ballpark figure on what the parts should cost.

a6kZ2q8Kaa	My very next step would be to check if there is power getting to the burner. Is the fuse blown or the contact breaker thrown out, or is the plug top fuse blown if you are using such an arrangement?  The next step is to check if the water circulation pump is operating? The burner could be stopped running because it is up to temperature - this could be the case and yet the heat is not being delivered to the building because the pump is not working - in such a case the burner would be stopped and no light on the reset button.   Check the temperature gauge on the boiler - if there is one.  The next step is to check if the burner starts if you increase the boiler temperature by say five or ten degrees. After the test return it to its original setting.|`|07a647b6a4d7e292eacb07b50a5536b1aa	The fact that there is no light on the reset button indicates that there is no electricity getting to the unit.|`|SCByDpqOaa	No power getting to the burner, if you have power to the pump & programmer it maybe out on a manual reset overheat stat.

Which no doubt is what your friend might be thinking.     What I would do is show her exactly what you were sewing, and the report from the sewing machine shop, plus your invoice that you had paid to have it looked at, and how the repairman said it absolutely wasn't your fault....and then, I would pay her nothing.     Your comparison of the 35 year old car is an apt one.    Oh, and you've probably figured out by now that it's never wise to borrow an old piece of machinery from anyone. Old machines get used to a certain style of use, and the gears get worn down in a certain way which is why they tend to break down when someone else uses it.

Connect it with the black from the fan and you will be set.    If you do not have a fan that will allow a light kit, you will need a new fan.

XgOIlU0eaa	i didnt know roto-rooter fixed boilers.,or chimneys....anyway,i dont know of very many 5 yr old boiler problems that would take several hours to fix,except maybe a" low water cut off " problem on a steam boiler..is it a steam or hot water boiler??. that must have been a lot of chimney work!!  if something was wrong with the pilot,,whether its a standing pilot or intermittent spark pilot,it shouldnt take long to diagnose  and repair that,,maybe 60-90 minutes at the most...what was written on your reciept as to what took all that time? any parts used?..did they have to install a chimney liner?..maybe you could ask a reputable local hvac repair co. what they would have charged for that job...my guess is the roto-rooter guy didnt know what he was doing and had to keep trying things until it worked....either that or they "padded the bill" by taking all day....did he have to use the phone a lot for assistance??....anyway,,post added details as to what exactly you were charged for and we can tell you what that normally would cost.........to answer your original question,,not much maintanance needed for a newer hot water boiler....steam boilers need to be periodically drained,also newer type electronic low water cut off sensers are supposed to be removed and cleaned yearly,although most people dont have that done and things work fine,,yearly check-up no guarentee that boiler wont have trouble during the season......dan|`|xNOloeJgaa	Have a professional come in to be sure that everything is cleaned and oiled ( if need be0 properly!|`|hDtJOY2vaa	the only maintenance you have to do to a gas boiler is every fall,clean it and make sure that the pilot light is clean,and the thermocouple is clean,ia"m surprised that you called rotor rooter and that it took them a whole day to fix it,it sounds like you got hosed,

256fe92c1f48eeee32f2750edc89baafaa	Look for a cast iron compressor that is oil lubed.  The 'oilless' ones are really loud and will drive you nuts sooner or later.  Pretty much any compressor with a motor, drive belt, compressor will be iron pump and oil lubed and reasonably quiet and durable.  And pretty much any compressor where the motor and pump are all one unit will be oilless, aluminum pump, and loud as hell as well as less reliable.    An old used compressor that's made well will probably work better, last longer, and run quieter than a more expensive, brand new oilless one.  You get Craigslist where you are?

N4IvZmPiaa	A lot of people will give me grief for saying this, but really any of those portable heaters are designed and fall under the category of a construction heater in the gas handling codes. They were never meant to heat any part of a living area while people are inhabiting it. That being said...I know everyone uses them in ice fishing huts, garages, sheds and homes in a pinch. Just remember that these are unvented heaters. They are using up the air that you breathe, and they are putting products of combustion into that air.     The rule of thumb that we use is 1 square inch of fresh air supply for every 1000 btu's. So if it's a 20,000btu heater you need a 2 inch by 10 inch opening to provide adequate combustion air, and ventilation for the spent gases. I would recommend opening a window slightly at each end of the trailer when you use it. As I said above, everyone uses these things...but UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES should you have this running while anyone is sleeping in there! These units can easily start to produce carbon monoxide if the air supply is not adequate or the fuel runs low. Also carbon monoxide detectors are an absolute must have!     I've used the Mr.Heater line of products and fine them good and reliable, but just please be careful in how you use them! I don't want to read about you in the paper!|`|V9HNzXFuaa	You can use them, just be sure to crack a window or 2 because they do put out carbon monoxide and deplete the oxygen in the air.  You should have a carbon monoxide detector if you will be using them.|`|80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	I bought 1 at Lowes about 2 weeks ago.  Current end-of-season (here in Richmond, VA) sale meant 25% off.    Side of box says "vent-less"  "99.9% free".    But papers inside the box advises you to have an opening at least 4 1/2 inches * 4 1/2 inches to let oxygen into your living quarters.    Also bought a 20 pound propane tank to go with this 20,000 btu heater.    This heater (Big Buddy ?) operates with a fan which will run off of 4 D size batteries - which is good because I wanted somnething that could run when the electric power was off.  Heater will work without the batteries but you will not get the heat spread out as far from the unit.    Heater has 3 setting - about 5,000 btu; 9,000 btu, and 20,000 btu.    I ran it the first 4 hours at 5,000 then set it up to the medium level for about 4 hours and then all the way up for overnight.  Worked fine.  Used most of the 20 pound propane tank in less than 24 hours.      Doesn't have a thermostat setting which would turn  itself on & off. This is on more expensive units that have higher btu ratings. So it stays on - once you turn it on.  But at this low heat output, it probably would need to stay on to keep your living space warm.    Does have an oxygen depreciation sensor - if you don't have that 4 1/2 * 4 1/2 opening to the outside and it removes too much oxygen from inside your living space - it will turn itself off.    More as a safety precaution - I bought a 12 foot hose to connect to the 20 pound tank.  Didn't feel comfortable with the tank setting within a few inches of the heater - but that's more of a personal preference.      Without the extra 122 foot hose, you can only connect very small (1 or 2 pound?) can to the heater.  Which would not last longer.      If the tank leaks, 12 feet vs 6 inches wouldn't make much difference before the gas fumes contacted the flame.    Also purchased a fuel filter to connect between the 12 foot hose and the burner.  All total, about $200.    But (as I tell my wife) if the heat / electricity goes out - the roads would probably be undriveable - so what would you do - freeze?    Unit are sold at Lowes with higher btu ratings and with the auto thermostat - but I was told they would need at least a 100 pound tank.  I agree.  And that this tank would have to be outside the living space and installed by a professional plumber/installer.  Cost ?      If I was going to all this expense, I would have a gas company install a 50,000 or higher btu unit and a 200 pound tank outside.  If I could go thru a 20 pound tank, at 20,000 btu within 24 hours - I would have to consider the worse storm I have seen here has taken 3-4 days for everything to melt and power to come back on.    We were going thru a bad cold snap and power outage when I bought this portable unit.  People were almost fighting to get their hands onto these units.  Overall, I'm happy with mine - but it is only rated for heating about 700 square feet.  So you would probably have to close off some rooms to stay warm.|`|aTbLf3PHaa	NO unvented gas heating appliance is legal to use inside an RV period.  In fact regular "vented" heating appliances aren't legal either.  All RV gas heating appliances must be of the "Direct Vent" or "Sealed Combustion" variety.    Many folks are aware of the problem of Carbon Monoxide (CO) buildup but many do not consider the fact that when a gas appliance burns it uses air to sustain combustion.  In a sealed compartment (like an RV), once this available air is consumed, the appliance begins to burn inefficiently producing large amounts of CO.  Twenty-two parts per million CO is enough to impair.

jaHkY4Rbaa	Is the popping sound coming from the junction box or the fan ?    I would be 100% sure that there is either damaged insulation on one of the hot wires, or you have compressed a wire between metal surfaces.    Popping sound usually indicated that there is arcing, so somewhere should be burned evidence.    If the switch is popping, then you have connected a hot wire to a neutral or ground.  Again, it could be the feed wire insulation damage when you were hooking up the wires.      OR    The white wire in the junction box, is actually the hot wire.    Disconnect the fan, and determine which wire is hot, with a meter or sensor.|`|hDtJOY2vaa	it sounds like you have a short,which means that one of your wires is touching the ground due to insulation breaking down through wire.|`|Iy0si0HYaa	you have something wired wrong,the white strip ussaly indicates a neutral hook that to white and try that.|`|PE8vFmGcaa	Remove the black wire with white stripe from the black from the ceiling and connect with the white.

Ovj7Nf25aa	The best you can use is plain vinegar. What I do is I set the machine to shortest cycle and let it run as a prewash so the all the dirt becomes moist and loose.  Then, I pour a whole small bottle of vinegar inside the machine and turn it on in the regular cycle. Vinegar will not only clean the inside of the machine, it also deodorize, keep the drain clean and help to keep the drain pipes unclogged.    The same thing goes with your washing machine.  Every couple of months, let it fill up, pour a whole small bottle of vinegar and let it complete a cycle.  The inside of the washing machines will be clean from residues and the drain pipes will stay unclogged as well.|`|3W18HDxxaa	mix  bakeing soda with water  add it to the washer, run it with out cloths|`|Zbn8A7Geaa	They actually make cleansers for dishwashers.

JoeeBzXraa	The spring you found, is the spring tension-er for the belt.  You can replace it, and you should be good to go.  It probably popped off because either a) the belt is worn out and stretching, or b) you hit some snow that made the blower die out.  Either way, the spring goes down on the lower belt roller and back to the block.  Real easy to fix.  Keep it.  I have had my 20" toro paddle snow blower for well over 15 years, and It keeps going like a champ.|`|r1D9P4Vyaa	You are lucky to get 8yrs out of that one.

Just check the oil before using it, keep it full, then check the gas, pull the cord! off you go, Good Luck!

v3xEtuLLaa	Did you sand and prime first?  That's a VERY important step.  Sanding between coats is a good idea as well.  Did you use a roller or brush?  A roller will give a smoother finish than a brush.  Give it a light sanding and another coat, hopefully that will help.  One thing to think about, though.  Semi-gloss shows a lot more flaws than a paint with less sheen.  I usually use satin finish when I paint trim.  It gives a soft lustre and is easy to clean, but it isn't too shiny.  Hope this helps.|`|YY24gmRpaa	When I paint doors, I use a roller to get the paint on fast and a little thicker than normal.  Then quickly using a good six inch brush lightly go over the whole surface with long strokes.  The idea is not to remove any paint, just smooth it out. Be careful when painting the edges and do not get any on the sides.  Let the painted side dry thoroughly, at least 24 hours in a warm well ventilated location. I also drive two large nails in each end and set the nails on the saw horses so that the sides do not get messed up sitting on anything..  Simply touch up the nail holes  with paint when done and nobody will ever know they are there.|`|65dd1e82844d8a77bcb832fac12281edaa	One of the problems could be the paint started to dry before you finished painting.This can show irregularities in the paint.I would try painting the door with a small sponge roller and quickly brush the door in long strokes from top to bottom.Hope this helps!!|`|PRx6j6YQaa	did you prime it first? is it the wood grain showing thru? it may take one or more coats to even the paint out. if using brush use long strokes|`|Sxlcyua5aa	Is the paint dry or are you looking at it while it is still wet?   If it is still wet then let it dry and see how it looks.   If it still looks irregular then give it another coat.   Make sure you stir the paint thoroughly before giving it another coat.   What you are probably seeing is that the pigment was not uniform in the can that is why you probably have an uneven coating.   Nothing wrong with semi gloss for trim.   I like it because it because I can wipe it when it is dirty.   But the more glossy the paint, the more flaws it shows in the surface.   Good luck.|`|13vZXQG6aa	If the paint is not old or hasn't been frozen, most likely you are either dry brushing it or you have the environment pretty warm to where it's starting to dry too quick and you're brushing over the existing painted portion which will make it look irregular. Also, depends on what you mean by irregular. Like stated earlier, did you prime? And if so, how many coats of finish have you put on it? Does "PLAIN" mean it is raw wood?
fe0b006f74120e4970825a1b8eb125b3aa	Builder is probably right that it is settling. However the real question is if he or his engineer (if any) acted negligently and built a substandard foundation that is settling so soon. Settling does happen - but a good foundation plan and based on good geotech work will generally minimize this and what you are describing is not minimal. You should ask the builder for a copy of the geotech report and his plans used to obtain his building permits. In this information will be the geotech signing off on the foundation plan. You should then determine if the builder followed the plans. If no information is forthcoming from the builder then you could either contact an engineering or architect firm to review your problems and come up with a fix and an estimate of cost. Present this to the builder.  Alternatively you could contact your insurance company (homeowners insurance) - check your policy and state law first to make sure they cant simply cancel your policy when they hear the bad news - insist that they do something ie make the contractor provide a permannet fix to the problems or they will be on the hook for it. Good luck.|`|mtmMQH4Xaa	Some things are beyond a builders control.    The bulging in the stairwell is either a bad drywall job or one of the studs warped after installation.    the cracks where ceiling meets wall. if it's an inside wall and you live in a cold climate, roof truss can heave up creating a crack.    Most plaster cracks happen in the 1st year due to shrinkage and a contractor would be a fool to even bother with fixing any cracks in the first year.    The crack in the cinder block, if just 1 block my guess is it was cracked when installed..    All new homes settle and dry out to some extent, some more then others.     The moisture level in a new home is high and when heating season begins you start to really dry the house out.. Cracks are going to happen.    If I had been the builder, I would have explained this to you and assured you that I would be back to fix it all up for you. no sense wasting time fixing a few cracks now then you calling every month because you found another crack.|`|1nbYdXE0aa	This usually occurs during the first heating season on new houses.  What is happening is the lumber in the house framing is aclimating to an average moisture content.  As your heating system is used more and more this winter or even the a/c in the summer, the lumber in your home is drying out naturally which can cause cracks in drywall. On large vertical framing areas such as stairways where the drywall is stacked on top of each other it really shows up.  This usually involves cutting out along the crack - applying new fibermesh drywall tape and then mud/sand over that. These cracks on tall walls usually run horizontally. On 8' walls it usually is in the corners and at top corners of doors/windows. The center wall of a home might also show some cracking at the ceiling. This is called truss uplift and has to do with the moisture content in roof trusses which can pull & twist the bottom of the truss so much that it cracks the drywall.  Your builder is correct, however you need to keep a log of when you talked to him about this problem, or better yet send him a registered letter w/ proof of receipt mailed to you. List all the problems and date(s) you spoke to him/her about them. Someone at his/her office will need to sign for this letter which proves it was received.  Explain to him/her that at some point it needs to be considered as settled down - then it needs patched/primed and painted.   Many homeowners insist on semi-gloss finish but I suggest a flat paint in the stairway which will help hide the patched area much much better than semi-gloss.

UNUJNgHxaa	I am going to try and answer this question with out getting to involved with theories. Here goes. Air expands and contracts as it gets hotter and colder. IF you add air to a mattress on a hot day, and it cools off the air pressure will decline, making it look flat. If you inflate it on a cold day the exact opposite will happen. It will expand and be over inflated. So to answer your question, Yes it can deflate without a leak. In your situation I think it is leaking. Fill the bed up with air. Fill the bathtub up with water and completely submerge the bed in the water. If you see bubbles then you have a leak. You may have to put some pressure on the bed. I hope this helps. Good luck.|`|AA10343094	are you sure your'e closing the valve properly? it could be leaking out the valve that you use to fill it. otherwise, throw some lightly soapy water on the seams first and lay on it (just do a little bit at a time) and look to see if it bubbles. if it does, just get yourself a patch (available at most hardware stores) and apply to the spot that was leaking after it dries. if it's not the seams, then check underneath and see if you set it on something sharp and remove and plug as described above!|`|vl6OtBfWaa	Yes,  most materials are pourous and lose air if your mattress is old or made of inferior materials or been exposed to the sun or salt water it can lose air without having a leak.|`|Vk1Aj44Waa	happens to mine|`|BqPr9jDUaa	I would put soap and water on the seams and look for bubbles to make sure its not leaking at the seams. You could also listen for leaks near the valves since that is another common problem area. I have never had a blow up mattress that didn't leak somewhere eventually.|`|Iy0si0HYaa	it has a leak somewhere it can be very hard to find a leak if it's small.have you tried soapy water if not get a spray bottle and mix about 2 tablespoons of  liquid dish washing soap fill the rest with water and re inflate the mattress as tight as you can then spray and watch for bubbles.if you've already tried that.then if you have a pool lay it in the water and look for bubbles do one side then the other, you'll find it. be sure to check the valve too|`|Qtdm5q9jaa	the material they are made of does perish over time and becomes permeable to air . in other words the air escapes through the material it is made of
h7qkIGsKaa	Next day.     Lining paper doesn't always make much difference as it was meant to be an underlay for wallpaper and never meant to be painted.|`|4uB0bbhnaa	usually 24 hours should do if the room is heated and well ventilated|`|AA11304025	1 day if the room is warm|`|uEjh3CAbaa	the next day or to be sure leave it a couple of days and do all skirtings,window sills and door casing in between.|`|AA11966831	Leave for a good 24 hours to dry out then you can paint it. when you do the paper might bubble but don't worry when it drys out it will stick back to the wall. happy painting|`|0AaiHizlaa	I would leave it for a couple of day's(about 3) and while that's going on you can do the other jobs like painting the ceiling etc etc.    Then you can come back to it a few days later.    Make sure the room is well ventilated,..it will help it dry quicker!
fel6dgh6aa	Try www.HGTV.com.|`|G4XiBNMzaa	I am unsure about a video, but you can purchase books at Home Depot, or any gardening store. These books are very detailed as to how to trim (prune)  rose bushes. Home Depot carry a variety of these kinds of books. Or go to your local nusery to get help.  Good luck
68e7a125a67f127a280f01fc8dbf5901aa	I have used many different types of paint, and they all are adequate. Some are better at covering darker colors underneath in fewer coats. I like Behr from HD, my house painter hates it and swears by Benjamin Moore. I buy cheap Color Place paint from WalMart for projects, and haven't had any trouble. More important than the brand, in my opinion, is surface prep. If the surface is dirty, greasy, peeling or pock marked, no paint will stick well or look good.|`|jaHkY4Rbaa	I have had very good results with General Paint's Breeze line of acrylic latex paints. (for more than 25 years in the renovating business)    easy to apply  good coverage  easy to patch and match  durable finish  quick curing  good colors
omegLbOAaa	play around with the Sherwin Williams color visualizer to help you imagine how the colors will look together. It is the best paint visualizer on the web, imho. I like how their color palette is laid out, I like that you can search by color family & color name, the "painted" rooms look the most realistic, and it suggests coordinating color schemes. You can literally spend hours:  http://www.sherwin.com/visualizer/    I think "melange green" (  6710) & "pearly white" (  7009) might be a good choice.    You can take a photo of your house & upload it to the makeover gallery on this website:  http://www.roomvues.com/  You can get color suggestions & for $5 they'll photoshop them onto your room so that you can get an idea of what it will look like.|`|ee33b2a393b166491be1cc514e3f4156aa	I like your idea but think a medium shade of green would look more vintage, or a soft celery shade.|`|AA11305474	I love that combination and have done it for clients and in my own home.  It is a very sophisticated and elegant look.  Go for it.|`|NXptHm5zaa	ya that would look good|`|ozfFa4PZaa	I think that a light green would go well with the brown trim, that is if it a dark brown. But is the brown is lighter than your idea sounds great!|`|9WxIYtEfaa	I would just make sure you like it by getting the paint chips and comparing it against your trim. If you don't like it, you can always paint over it! Paint is cheap!
f3bef099bbfd0ae82346540f2d1b01d6aa	if you have a fairly old boiler it may be that ..........a boiler is the same as a kettle ...think of a kettle boiling ...it pops ....same with a boiler over an average age ...it may be that ............. theres not a lot you can do with it other than giving it a flush and putting a chemical in it to reduce the noise or  clean the system ....... if the noise is all over the house then it could be the pipes expanding as they heat ... a way to reduc e the noise is to get some felt lagging and insulate around the pipes where there pass through the joists under your floor boards ..hope this helps|`|bxlYleZkaa	it is the hot water causing pipes to expand.|`|HSho71EPaa	Air....somewhere. When you bleed the radiators, start with the lowest and first in line with the boiler and finish off at the last/highest.     Don't just let the air out....let a little water out as well...and use a cloth!!    Good Luck|`|2AXTmluFaa	poltergeist.|`|z44rR7H7aa	ye thts proberly coz of warming up my ones do it sometimes the pipes vibrate and if they aint screwd into the wall they will hit sompthing and make a noise OK by     and plz answer my question http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|oxqXDBR9aa	The best product to quieten kettling in an old cast iron boiler is Fernox mb1. you need to drain the system, put the Fernox in the header tank and refill and bleed system.

wKQbNvm9aa	Never had to do this myself, but maybe flour or oatmeal would work, or both together.  Flour is used to make the paste for paper mache.  And if you ever had oatmeal stuck to the baby's highchair, you know it turns into cement!

When I poured it into the jar, by the time it cooled, I couldn'teven insert an ice pick in it because it was so hard!  I simmered it for about 1/2 hour I think.
