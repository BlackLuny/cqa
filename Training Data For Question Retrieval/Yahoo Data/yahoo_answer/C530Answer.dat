VPlKbDplaa	If you have both gained 3 stones in weight and have depression too I recommend getting your thyroid function checked at the doctor's. Go and mention this to your GP and ask him or her to check your thyroid gland function. It sounds like you might have an underactive or sub-optimally functioning thyroid gland. I would do this first before contemplating taking any pills to lose weight. <br>  <br>  Also, there is no magic pill to lose weight as it really needs to be a combination of supplements and healthy eating and a good exercise program. But you need to check your thyroid function first and proceed from there. Because if it is not functioning optimally then it will be difficult to lose weight without rectification.<br>  <br>  Other than that I would suggest regular exercise such as brisk walking for half an hour a day minimum. Avoid refined foods as much as possible and avoid fatty foods. But for heath: do eat oily fish and use a little extra virgin olive oil in your cooking.  Go for lean cuts of meat if you are not vegetarian, steamed fish, steamed vegetables and lots of salads. You can still eat some cakes but make them a treat, a reward for sticking to a good diet and exercise plan. <br>  <br>  You could also consider taking apple cider vinegar in water. There are some claims to success with this as a slimming aid. Just add a couple of teaspoons of apple cider vinegar to a full glass of water and drink this three times a day before your main meals. <br>  <br>  For the depression: Lemon balm capsules or tea might help. You may find also that if you start regular exercise that this could also help with depression as the endorphins released upon exercise are known to have an anti-depressant effect. <br>  <br>  If your thyroid gland  turns out to be alright then take sea kelp tablets or add seaweed to your diet. These are rich in iodine that promotes a healthy thyroid gland and helps boost the metabolism. Make sure you get enough B Vitamins too - consider Brewers Yeast as a supplement. <br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|Rk46lIBwaa	I am afraid no such entity exists, if you want to stand any chance at all of losing any weight you need to both diet and take regular vigorous exercise.|`|xJW1RSaAaa	If you want to loose weight for good do not follow a faddy diet, they actually make you fatter in the long-term.  Try eating healthily - cut out sugar, over processed and fried food. You can eat as many vegetable you like if they are steamed, or lightly cooked, make soups with pulses, stri fries with brown rice and a bit of tamari sauce, sushi, smoothies - home made only without icecream and yoghurt!<br>  <br>  Remember to use hardly any salt too! Drink lots of water, not soda as this really heaps on the extra calories in your diet and artifially sweetened drink contain cancer causing chemicals.<br>  <br>  You might have an imbalance of miinerals in your body that has caused you to become depressed and comfort eat, or you have some unresolved issues. I used to be 3 stone overweight too, now I generally eat really healthily and I don't drink as that causes lows, comfort eating and makes me crave fried and processed food - so a no go! I now go to the gym 3 times a week, or I just go to yoga and use my exercise ball and step in the evenings. I have a small son who i have to fit around, and try to do some exercse even when I am exhausted at the end of the day so you have no excuse!<br>  <br>  We also sold our car so we all have to walk everywhere - walking is the BEST way to burn fat so get to it. You could even buy some weight bracelets to add some oomph to your regime. Perhaps buy an IPOD and downloads lots of music and podcasts of plays and radio shows you like to get you in the exercise mood!<br>  <br>  Just remember there are no quick fixes, herbal pills may work but you'll get fatter afterwards, trust me, this is the best way!|`|akcGfgdcaa	<a href="http://www.healthydirect.com/category/Category-Slimming/d.jsf;jsessionid=044F644339DD584098DEAEE96F906AD9.www2" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthydirect.com/category/Ca...</a><br>  <br>  Hopefully you'll find someting there, but as much as these pills may work, you need to do some form of exercise and change your diet up if you want to be able to lose weight and maintain that loss.|`|GM3zog4Jaa	Hoodia is a herb that naturally supresses appetite. <br>  You can buy it in good health shops.

utVANWDWaa	I've had 5 root canals ... 2 in the front, 2 in the back an 1 on the side. They give you shots to numb you down - after that you don't feel a thing for the rest of the day! <br>  The shot is the only pain you will feel.... It stings and can hurt a bit but it only lasts like a second.<br>  <br>  You may experience pain AFTER your root canal is completed, when your home.

After the first couple times I had sex, I didn't like it and said I'd never do it again but it gets MUCH better. The first time usually isn't so great.|`|v1nUmhLTaa	It is different for everyone.

f4bBgJqLaa	I have a tongue piercing, and it is bad for your teeth to have a metal stud (like the one they first pierce it with) because it knocks against your teeth and damages the enamel. After my swelling went down I bought a plastic stud, which is less harmful because it is softer, just try not to knock the stud against your teeth if you can help it! :-)|`|tRKAgC6faa	idk if tongue piercing is bad for them but lip piercings can be because they rub up against the gums and wear it right off.|`|Jm1PnGdMaa	Tongue piercings over time knock the enamel off of your teeth and can cause rotting of the teeth.

Tc23KWgzaa	I'm a patient, not a doctor.  Zoloft usually works well.  But if it doesn't, it will be a real bear to get rid of it.  It causes lots of withdrawal symptoms.  It wouldn't be my first choice for an anxiety med.  (I've tried them all).<br>  <br>  You've got a whopping case of anxiety, sweetie.  I know getting out of the house is really important, but going back to school will raise your anxiety level at least 20X.  You're not ready for that.  Going to a psychiatrist (medical dr. specializing on mental problems) to get medicine is a really good idea.  You also need a psychologist (therapist) who can help you work on the feelings that cause your anxiety.<br>  <br>  Finish out the year in homeschooling.  Work with the doctors.

You need vitamins and minerals and amino acids.|`|3uaIuxz8aa	A psychiatrist will know what medication to put you on. It may be zoloft, or something else entirely. Medication should be used in conjunction with talk therapy. Best of luck. <br>  <br>  PS. It's okay if you don't have friends from high school. I never did. It's not about the people, you're sent there to learn. so LEARN.|`|6w7FKrlfaa	i am on 300 mg of zoloft daily for anxiety.  it doesn't help me at all.|`|lpDyjosfaa	Yes, Zoloft is an SSRI (selective-serotonin reuptake inhibitor). These help greatly with anxiety disorders, including social anxiety disorder. You will feel much better and more social, too! Your problem sounds pretty severe, though, so Zoloft might not be the right drug for you (it's not extremely strong). Ask your doctor what medicine he/she suggests that you take. Note that it might take up to a year to find the perfect balance of medications to best help you. You should definitely go see a pyschiatrist as soon as possible before your condition worsens and develops into complete agoraphobia (the fear of leaving your house or going into public areas). You should also be having regular therapy sessions, which will help tremendously.<br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  Kat|`|I2Tw4zOAaa	Meditation really helps you calm yourself down and breakdown anxieties.  You can find a balance that allows you to open up to others without the fear of rejection.

Judging from your picture you shouldn't have any trouble with guys.|`|PcPswmv5aa	I have struggled  horribly with these SSRI's (prozac, Paxil..)  Please be very careful.  The withdrawal is really difficult.  They have proven that exercise is just as effective.  Placebo's also have been just as effective.  The best idea would be to go to a certified Cognitive behavior therapist for strategies for working on your social skills.  Drugs will not fix the shyness.  Drugs will not reverse what has made you shy.  Fix the root issues.|`|REZXqRdoaa	To me personally zoloft isn't a good anxiety medicine, it's known to be an anti-depressant.

Medication may be called for and useful, but with some help you may be also be able to resolve your issues without it. From what you've described of your situation, it sounds very likely that some skills and techniques a therapist could help you learn might work. Either way, a therapist who specilizes in working with anxiety (and that's not everyone) would be a good first step, and he/she could then assist you in gettng connected for medication, if needed. They won't be able to prescribe it themselves unless they are a psychiatrist, since only a MD can prescribe the medication. (That doesn't mean you should look for a psychitrist first - most of them tend to be really busy and not give as much "therapy time" as a counselor, psychologist, or social worker would.)<br>  <br>  I do strongly encourage you to seek out some professional assistance soon and to know that doing that is a sign of strength, not weakness. It's simply doing something to take care of yourself. One of the problems with anxiety is that longer you let the pattern run, the more likely it is to keep repeating itself and perhaps get worse. So not doing anything actually makes it less and less likely that it will fix itself or you'll "just grow out of it". Because you're still young, now is the time to break the pattern, whether through therapy, medication, or a combination of the two. I've worked with teens for over 30 years and believe the earlier you start, the faster and easier it will be to overcome these difficulties. <br>  <br>  Best of luck,   Geoffrey|`|31SFWKNvaa	I think your anxiety sound really bad.

13k2WKx8aa	You should have gone to the doctors.<br>  <br>  There's a problem with your eustachian tubes. I get the slight popping every time I swallow, but that could be seen as normal (as could yours on a normal basis). When you swallow, the eustachian tubes open up to equalize the pressure in the airspace in your ear with the pressure of the air around you (ever felt the pressure and equalization in a plane, in a high-rise, or going up and down hills in a car?).<br>  <br>  Do you plug your nose when you sneeze? You'll notice that the feeling can be replicated if you plug your nose and try to blow out through it.

If only for a few days, it could be something as simple as an ear infection, but there's no way to tell unless you see a doctor (or nurse who knows what she's looking for).

Drnpe4T5aa	Check out the CDC website for norwalk virus or norovirus (it's called both).<br>  Yes, you have a virus - it's just not a very strong one.<br>  But you can still pass it on, so keep on top of careful handwashing.<br>  **********************<br>  Please note, I did *not* say you had a “little case” of the flu.<br>  Because you have a milder/weakened stain, your immune system is keeping it bay.<br>  Viruses live to multiply.  Viruses not only multiply, but they are constantly changing - this is why we still have yet to find a real lasting cure for the common cold.  At best we can treat symptoms.<br>  Traveling from one host to the next is risky business for viruses.  If the virus comes to land on a door knob that is wiped off with a cleaner, some of the viruses will die, except for the really strong ones.  It only take a few of these really strong (virulent)  viruses to *really* mess you up, in the truly icky sense of the word.  <br>  However, if a virus can jump from one host to another with little or no necessary effort (picture a preschool with kids constantly touching things or putting things in their mouths, setting them down, then another child picking them up an mouthing the same object, etc, etc…) then it is not *just* the strong viruses that are multiplying, but also the weaker ones as well.  This makes that viral community as a whole, weaker.   <br>  If a particular strain of virus is passed around several times this way, it weakens it further, to the point that, when a person catches it, their immune system has very little trouble putting a stop to the multiplying viral infection before it even gets to take a strong hold.  (Which is why, if you have ever been a part of a larger scale infection cycle, like when one family member gets it, followed by another, and then another, you will often see a decrease in infection time as well as diminished symptoms)  <br>  Yes, some strains of the norovirus are more prone to certain symptoms – eg: vomiting vs diarrhea.  However, regardless of strain, if the strain you are infected with is stronger, you will have worse symptoms and a longer-lasting illness.<br>  Also, as you shed the virus for up to 3 weeks (according to the CDC) - *not* just for 24 hours, you can continue to infect others if you are not careful with your sanitary practices.|`|01Mu3wUeaa	There is no such thing as the "stomach flu".The most common stomach bug virus is Norwalk virus.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you possible do have itThere isn't such a thing as having a "little case" of it.You either have it or you don't.It sounds like you have a different strain than the typical projectile vomiting strain (consider yourself very lucky!)<br>  <br>  <br>  You two should be feeling better by now but expect to be a bit off for a few more days.<br>  <br>  Here are prevention tips:<br>  <br>  Norwalk virus<br>  (Just remember that hand sanitizers will not kill this virus.House hold cleaners such as Lysol will also not kill you.You must use bleach.)<br>  <br>  The Norwalk virus causes viral Gastroenteritis which is known as the nasty 24 hour bug that causes explosive and sudden diarrhea and projectile vomiting.Usually non life threating but can cause complications in the very young,elderly and those with compromised immune systems.<br>  <br>  PREVENTION-Wash your hands before preparing food/eating food and most importantly, TOUCHING YOUR MOUTH/NOSE/EYES.<br>  <br>  The ONLY way to become infected with this virus is if you ingest the contaminated fecal/vomit particles through your eyes,nose and mouth.<br>  <br>  It is impossible to "breathe" in the virus BUT possible to become infected by breathing in aerosol "spray" droplets from someone vomiting right next to you.(the droplets settle within minuted but can still infect someone until cleaned with bleach)<br>  <br>  Even if your whole family breaks out with this virus, you can prevent it by washing your hands for at least 15-20 seconds with warm water and soap.Remember that you are not killing the virus, you are washing it down the drain even if you use an antibacterial soap (which only kills bacteria, not viruses) hand sanitizers are also not successful in killing the virus.<br>  <br>  If a member of your family comes down with the virus, let them know to wash their hands AFTER a bowel movement and vomiting.<br>  <br>  To clean infected areas, clean with BLEACH.Clean bathrooms (all infected areas) with a bleach solution as soon as possible and be sure to prevent cross contamination and wash your hands afterwards.Especially children! wipe down all commonly touched objects like door knobs, faucet handles, light switches, toilet flushers etc.<br>  <br>  People are STILL contagious even after 24 hours after their symptoms settle down so it is always important to wash your hands after the rest room (which you should do anyways!)<br>  <br>  The key to staying Norwalk virus free is to keep sanitary.Wash your hands after using the bathroom...you could prevent other peoples misery as well as yours!!<br>  <br>  TIPS:Do not share any cups/plates/utensils with an infected person and be sure to wash in a bleach solution to prevent cross contamination with the rest of your family.

AA11091145	When SSRI's poop out, you are still on the medication so you don't get withdrawal symptoms.  A typical SSRI poop out would be you are on the medication for six months and it worked well for depression and anxiety.  Six months later, the medication is no longer effective and the depression and some of the anxiety may return.  You don't get those flu-like symptoms of withdrawal until you actually stop taking the medication.  <br>  After six months you could increase the dose of the SSRI or just switch to another one which is cheaper and works better.  You can then rotate back to the original one in another six months and it would work again.<br>  <br>  The older antidepressants are stronger and can work well for years and years.  Wellbutrin also doesn't seem to poop out, but it is not a SSRI.  I agree with the above guy that they is a lot of unknowns of SSRI side effects.|`|0Ye3d4C3aa	for me when i build up a tolerance i dont have withdrawl symptoms, they just no longer work, and i have to begin a higher dose. but i have stopped taking my lexapro before with out slowly lessening my doses, and the withdrawl was horrible.|`|PcPswmv5aa	There is so much the doctors and scientists don't know about SSRI's.  The answer is yes it could poop out.  I took Paxil for a couple of years.  I got fat and my thyroid slowed way down.  It was HELL withdrawing.  Then I got on prozac and took that for a few years.  It was easier coming off of it but not by much.  I feel these drugs have really been over prescribed in society.  I wish I never was put on them.  I read all the journals on them and they have proven that exercise is just as effective as the SSRI's.  They have also proven that placebo's are as effective.  Most all of the studies were done in foreign countries were they could manipulate the result.  Horrible folks allowed these drugs.  Sorry if I am a bit jaded..... experience.|`|Yu7y6yfraa	Hummm......  Benzediazepines tend to have a long half life.  Basically, they remain in your system well after you have stopped taking them.<br>  <br>  Most of the antidepressants that I have taken, do not stay in the system  very long. My psychiatrists have always tapered me off of antidepressants while gradually moving onto different <br>  antidepressants.<br>  <br>  What is IBS?  just wondered.<br>  <br>  I have been treated with these types of MDS for about 26 years.  It seems like  every time I find an antidepressant that works great; after a year or 2 it stops working.  It gradually begins to work less and less.  <br>  <br>  I have ADHD, severe depression, bipolar II and extreme anxiety attacks.  My psychiatrist told me that that this is a common problem with people who are Bipolar I or II - the antidepressant discontinuing to work.  I have never had any withdrawl effects.  I too have taken Valium for about 15 years, but have never had a problem with addiction from it.  I think the ADHD makes my body react very differently to many drugs.  I feel nothing from the Valium.  It just stops my hands from shaking.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped.  Maybe you can find something helpful within my rambling.<br>  <br>  I wis you well.

lpDyjosfaa	That is practically the dictionary definition of bipolar disorder (also commonly called "manic depression"). Bipolar disorder is a genetic mental illness that is defined by intense mood swings - periods of mania (excessive energy and happiness, the feeling of being 'driven' to restless action) and periods of severe depression (fatigue, hopelessness, the whole shebang). These 'periods' of mania/depression generally last anywhere from around 3 or 4 days to 2 weeks at a time.<br>  <br>  A combination of medicine and therapy, regular exercise, and a healthy diet is the most common treatment for bipolar disorder.

You should definitely talk to a doctor and give medication a shot. It didn't work for me, but I've found ways to cope myself. I can't tell you how to do it tho, it doesn't work that way. You have to figure it out yourself by paying attention to things that set you off. I also agree that meditation is a great way to find your balance. Good Luck! and see a doctor.|`|I2Tw4zOAaa	This is called being bipolar.  It's a result of worse than just normal hormonal imbalances.

In the meantime attempt to find an inner balance through meditation, it does wonders.|`|0Ye3d4C3aa	if your mood changes are long cycles of days or weeks, then it could be bipolar, but if it just changes at the drop of a hat, it sounds more like a depression disorder. talk to a different doctor if yours isnt helping. until then, yes exercise does help, and so does eating healthy and keep your blood sugar constant, so have a couple of healthy snacks in your day as well, and get the right amount of sleep.|`|CARmP1zLaa	Borderline is something else.

In fact it's extremely hard to meditate when your mood swinging like that. I have bipolar and I control it with medication. I've also tried suicide before.

5IrunL2Xaa	Accutane is very effective, but it does have some severe side effects. As previously mentioned, dryness of the mucous membranes (nose, mouth,  eyes), thirst, plus your blood has to be monitored (triglycerides) by monthly liver chemistry tests.  Additionally staying out of the sun is advised.  Accutane is a vitamin A acid and in my opinion the severity of the side effects correlated with the effectiveness of the medication, although the side effects were quite annoying, but manageable.  I took it for twenty weeks and that was 25 years ago.  My acne was significantly reduced from that point on.  <br>  <br>  Additionally you must ensure you will not become pregnant (your doctor may require a prescription for birth control pills) do the degree of birth defects that it would cause. <br>  <br>  I don't know what age is appropriate, but you Dr.  would be able to advise you.|`|voC0qW5vaa	Yeah it sucks, i totally get it, I went on the Accutane course about 6 weeks ago, and it's working really well, but not without side effects. I've had dry lips, blurry vision, flushing, stomach pains and at the beggining a really bad flair up, but i have stuck with it, and the side effects have gradually gone away, and I now have really clear skin. I think it was worth it myself, but I've heard the side effects can be more severe. Then again they could not happen to you at all, it all depends. Hope this helped!
OO46VOIhaa	They will probably try but all you have to do is say NO!  I think it's absolutely RIDICULOUS that they send you a female nurse and expect you to accept it, but you don't have to.  Tell them you want a male nurse and they'll always comply.  I also make sure that if I need to be shaved they do it while I'm still conscious.  If you're unconscious they will probably have a woman do it even though they promised they wouldn't.  So I always INSIST that they do it before so I know a guy did it.  I don't trust female nurses at all.|`|0vLWaGeraa	They'll try.  Ask for a male nurse and they will find one.  There's no reason you have to have a woman.  The worst part is that it's usually a nurse's assistant or a tech which means it might be an 18 or 19 year old girl with little or no training or education.  Put your foot down.  They would never choose to cancel your surgery instead of finding a male nurse.  You can also shave it yourself beforehand.  If you do they could try to send a female nurse to verify that it's been shaved correctly but again, all you have to do is tell them you want a man to check it.  They can't force you to do anything.|`|nG2SM6Pdaa	Where I work we don't shave them anymore.  Back when we did it was done by orderlies.|`|E39LrR3kaa	I certainly would never let a woman do it.  That is unethical.  Have an orderly do it or do it yourself.|`|pzgzUs2aaa	depends on surgery... if its "down there" then prob.  just like if you have brain surgery or sumthin they shave ur head|`|P29yKG3Haa	No.  You will definitely get a man.|`|DJZ801yvaa	No.  It is done by male nurses.|`|eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	Yes, it's true.  Although, you can do the shave job yourself before checking in the hospital for the surgery.  A nurse will still likely check to make sure things are shaved closely enough and  you still need to have the scrub job done.  It can also be done by a nursing assistant or a surgical technician, and there are males as well as females.  Most places will also wait to do the job until you have had a sedative, so you don't mind and don't really care who does the job.  Regardless,  it's not nearly as personal for them as it is for the patient obviously.  And if you are having surgery in the region, there will be a lot more people getting a peek at the equipment than just the person doing the shave job.  Keep in mind, it's personal to you, but the medical folks have seen the area a lot of other times, and will see it again in the future.  One part is pretty much like any other, and most are not that memorable.|`|GB1f4sEEaa	If you have to be shaven in that area for a surgery, you can request a female nurse or a male nurse, which ever one you feel more comfortable with.|`|kB4EJUKgaa	Any nurse, male or female, shaves any area that is about to receive surgery.

She's either pregnant or there's an underlying cause for the late period. Better to be safe than sorry. You say she isn't on birth control, has she ever been on it before and come off it recently?

Always ask your doctor or someone with requisite qualifications to professionally assess medical situations.<br>  <br>  Now, from my knowledge, as the initial poster mentioned, there is a seriously abnormal spread between your systolic and diastolic pressures.  You might want to try again to make sure that you're getting a correct reading.  <br>  <br>  If it is a correct reading, you're creeping into stroke territory with a systolic pressure that high.  Everything else seems reasonable for your age.  The result you got may also be from doing something/taking something that could increase your blood pressure, although, I am less likely to lean towards this because of the spread - the pressures normally move together.<br>  <br>  Check your blood pressure again and see what happens.  If it's still that high, get in touch with your doctor and discuss the situation.  Medications such as atenonlol or propranolol are excellent options for blood pressure situations like this - they do the job well, they have relatively low side effects (as well as complementary ones, too), and they don't cost very much in generic form. :)|`|5gG2OfHIaa	I think you should repeat your testing a few times to get a "clean result."   Certainly, your young age would not be contributory to elevated blood pressure.  Your systolic to diastolic spread seems to be abnormal.  I am not qualified to opine on your bottom line question of whether your one reading of 143/53 warrants management.|`|c8ebe8705eaf13a28547213ca1de8013aa	There is a great deal of confusion about the significance of blood pressure readings amongst lay people and physicians alike.  It may surprise you to know that at this time neither physicians or nurses are taught the proper technique of taking an accurate blood pressure.  I have written an article titled 'Accurate Blood Pressure Measurement' which I will be pleased to send to you but it is likely to be confusing if you do not have some medical background.  Blood pressure is under the influence of the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (I do not make these names up).  Blood pressure follows what physicians refer to as diurnal circadian variation.  This means that blood pressure rises and falls during the course of any given day.  Blood pressure is lowest during sleep, reaches its highest peak around 11 AM and a second peak around 4 PM.  Since blood pressure varies the most accurate and reproducible blood pressure is obtained upon awakening.  I refer to this as wake up - go to the bathroom - and then take your blood pressure.  First thing in the morning blood pressures have a well defined goal based upon more than 200 studies of 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.  The goal for first thing in the morning blood pressure is 115/075 mm Hg or less.  For every 20/10 mm Hg increase above this there is a doubling of cardiovascular risk.  Thus a person with a first thing in the morning blood pressure of 135/085 mm Hg (which may sound quite normal) has twice the cardiovascular risk of someone with a first thing in the morning blood pressure of 115/075 mm Hg.  If you wish to check your own blood pressure a fully automated digital unit should be purchased.  Consumer Reports rated the RelyOn unit (for sale at WalMart for $50 when I last checked) as a 'Best Buy'.  There is one (of many)  potential area for error in blood pressure measurement and that is the shape of your arm.  Relatively thin people's upper arm is cylindrical.  As people become increasingly over weight the upper arm tends to become more conical.  If the latter is the case then only the upper portion of the bladder inside the blood pressure cuff is able to occlude the artery creating a tourniquet effect.  Much higher pressures are required to occlude the artery and every if a so-called large blood pressure cuff is used the blood pressure tends to be falsely elevated.  Studies have shown that more than 20% of blood pressures taken by physicians and nurses are in error.  In the past only mercury weighted blood pressure units were used - these never require calibration.  Although the amount of mercury in these units was quite small meaning that if the glass cylinder broke and the mercury spilled it would harm even an infant.  Nonetheless fear of mercury toxicity has caused virtually all medical providers to use aneroid blood pressure units and these require calibration.  Studies have shown that 25% or so of aneroid blood pressure units being used in a medical setting are not calibrated and therefore the results by definition are not accurate.  There are a host of other variables that effect blood pressure measurement other than a blood pressure taken first thing in the morning.  The time of day has already been referenced but it is of note that from the lowest to the highest reading of the day the blood pressure may vary by as much as 50/25 mm Hg.  Therefore blood pressure readings taken at various times during the day are by definition not reproducible.  Your activities during the 30 minutes prior to the blood pressure measurement are also an issue.  If you are stressed, rushed, have smoked a cigarette, or consumed caffeine within 30 minutes of the blood pressure reading then this will increase the blood pressure.  Indeed - simply walking from the physician's waiting room to the examination room and having your blood pressure taken promptly by the nurse will falsely elevate the blood pressure.  The proper technique is for you to be seated for 10 to 15 minutes before the blood pressure is taken.  Note that I said 'seated'.  Most of the time you are sitting on the examination table when the nurse takes your blood pressure.  The arm is not 'relaxed' and this tends to falsely elevate blood pressure.  The proper way to take a blood pressure is for you to be seated in a chair with an arm for your arm to rest on.  The bend of the arm should be at approximately the height of the space between the 4th or the 5th ribs.  This approximates the apex of the heart and is referred to as the phlebostatic axis.  If you find a physician who knows what the phlebostatic axis is I will be very much impressed indeed.  An accurate blood pressure requires that the blood pressure cuff is of the right size for your arm and properly applied - snugly.  In addition the center of the bladder inside the blood pressure cuff should be aligned with the center of the crease of your arm known as the antecubital fossa.  The rate at which the cuff is inflated and deflated is of

Your dosage may be changed at that time. Your dosage may change constantly throughout your life. So once you are stable, still get blood tests at least every 6 months.|`|696vFx8Xaa	Just having hypothyroidism is not a big problem if there is no other abnormalities. It is just that you need to supply thyroxine orally until your gland becomes functining again (it may not always). Keep doing your Thyroid function test done every 3-6 months depending the level of control of your thyroid hormone.<br>  <br>  About the dose of thyroxine, it generally starts from 25 microgram a day upto ~200 microgram a day. So, i am a bit not clear about your dosing regime, please check the drug cover and find it out. Thyroid supplement has no side effect until you are not hyperthyroid.<br>  <br>  For the rest of the prognosis you should post the reports:<br>  FNAC of your thyroid gland<br>  Thyroid function test<br>  USG or CT scan of your thyroid gland / Neck.<br>  <br>  if you are just adolescent or pregnant or lactating then the hormone level comes back to normal in a few months time. These are the time of demand of higher thyroid hormones.|`|0nyWiro9aa	One can not judge severity based on the TSH alone. Some people walking around with a TSH of over a hundred and others can be gravely ill at much lower levels. The TSH is used in monitoring therapy and for diagnosis. You have already been diagnosed and so it is used to adjust your levels to within therapeutic range and to where most of your symptoms have been alleviated. You still have aways to go to get it down much more with increased dosage.|`|84821087cda14dd0bdf6bd3bbda14952aa	Welcome to the world of "MAKE BELIEVE HEALTH."  Thyroid medication is a very lazy way to make a feeble attempt at correcting your problem.  It is synthetic hormone therapy and you will be given a life sentence of taking that junk for the rest of your life.  Do you actually believe you are deficient in a drug?<br>  <br>  Doctors are lazy and take the easy way out by prescribing medication to solve this problem.  I know, I used to have the problem and was taking the maximum dosage of Synthroid.  This drug damages your body.<br>  <br>  There is a reason your thyroid is not working correctly.  And the test you are talking about, the TSH is not a conclusive test and only an indicator that your thyroid is not making enough hormones.  By giving you synthetic hormones, you are generating a deficiency of hormones being made by your thyroid and create a dependency on the drug.  Does that sound like health to you?  Even if your doctor has your T3 and T4 hormones tested, there can be problems with that test.  These hormones are subject to stereo chemistry and of the two mirror images of this hormone, only one is active.  To lump both in a test and make a determination of it's viability is NOT GOOD SCIENCE, but is being done most of the time.<br>  <br>  By giving you the hormone, you have NOT solve the underlying "root cause" of the problem and so your body is not working correctly for a reason.  Did your doctor tell you what is causing the problem, or did he just treat the symptom and ignore why your thyroid is not working well?<br>  Does that sound like he is doing the right thing by you?<br>  <br>  There are many reasons the thyroid becomes weak and does not work well or not produce the hormones.  The T3 hormones are made up of 2 parts iodine and 1 part tyrosine amino acid molecules.  The T4 hormones are 3 parts iodine and 1 part tyrosine amino acid molecules.  If you are deficient in iodine, for instance, how can your body make the hormones?  Did your doctor test you for iodine deficiency?  Don't you think he should have?  Doesn't that sound like a very basic problem that could be solved easily, instead of giving you drugs?  Also, if you are deficient in iodine, your thyroid only uses about 4% of your intake of that necessary mineral.  All of your organs need it, including your skin, etc.<br>  <br>  If you are a woman, been on birth control pills, this can definitely create this problem because the thyroid is part of the endocrine system.<br>  <br>  Do this one very simple test:  Get a bottle of "tincture of iodine" from your local pharmacy.  It's very cheap and used on wounds, so it is readily available to everyone.  Paint a 2" x 3" patch on your forearm or on your chest early in the morning.  Every few hours, check on it.  If you can't see it, note the time it took for it to disappear.  It should be still visible after 24 hours.  If it isn't, you are deficient in iodine.  If it disappears in a few hours, you are severely deficient and this could be a major factor in your thyroid deficiency issue.  <br>  <br>  If you have had any root canals, amalgam fillings, or teeth extractions by typical dentists, this could be a major contributor to your problem.  <br>  <br>  Do your homework, your doctor obviously is not interested in doing that.<br>  <br>  good luck to you

Boy you have your hands full.  By the way I am a woman so don't let the name scare you.  When I was almost 30 I started going to the YMCA everyday, and that helped keep my weight down for many years.  Now I am 65 and you guessed it.  My weight is up too, about 55 lbs.  But because I exercised from 26 to 55 my body built muscle and muscle weighs more than fat.  I did aerobics everyday and did body building for a few years, road a bycycle nearly 40 miles a day for a year and 1/2.  Walked on a treadmill and gazelle and still do.  Even tho my weight is up, I can still wear 10's-12's.  That tells me that exercise paid off in the long run.  Most people are shocked that I weigh 165 lbs because like I said muscle weighs more than fat.  And not only that I even look younger than your average 65 year old woman and work harder than most of them.Every summer I cut 8 acres of lawn on a tractor, take care of a pool and flower beds on the property.  Eat less meat and more vegetables.  That will help.  Have your thyroid checked.|`|39e46128b8ea5a82c45af42790e8132daa	Get a gym membership!

25Whzu2waa	Pull-ups ARE a bicep workout my man. However:<br>   -Do chin-ups (palms facing towards you)<br>   -Do pull-ups (palms facing away from you)<br>   -Do neutrals (the two bars sticking out where your palms would face each other)<br>  <br>  Use proper form. Don't yank yourself up like you're running away from something, and don't jump to start, or "swim" on the way up to aid yourself. You should be using your upper body ONLY. <br>  <br>  If you do it properly, you'll affect the outside of your pecs and your biceps the most. Wide grip pull-ups can also work on your back muscles. If you want pecs, do the push-ups like in the commercial too; in fact, the only exercise that's really not good in that commercial is the dips.

Three times a week is a good starting point if you can, and if not, it's a good goal to shoot for.<br>  <br>  Cycling is good for firming up, but the best exercise is weight training.|`|862f8e3d565cf11bb982e86b1a4dcdefaa	Did you eat before hand? You always need to eat before exercising. <br>  <br>  Try doing the class 2 days a week, gradually increasing if you feel like you need it more. Your legs were burning because they were doing MORE than usually. It will get easier as you go, as your body gets used to the extra work, but the burning is GOOD.
CmLDcfMfaa	I have never tried the berry juice but I have tried colon cleansing for weight loss and it is temporary.  <br>  <br>  I have lost an average of 2 pounds a week by keeping track of what I eat at www.everydayhealth.com  After you sign in click on My-Calorie-Counter.  This formula below might help you to know how many calories you need:<br>  Weight-Loss Calculation<br>   <br>  Q: I have a desk job that requires little physical activity, so four to five times a week I do the Curves workout for 30 minutes. In order to lose 2 pounds a week, how many calories should I be eating? <br>  — Mari, <br>  <br>  A: While I'd need your height, weight, and age to calculate this number specifically for you, most people generally need to eat approximately 10 calories per pound of weight to maintain that weight without strenuous activity. To lose 2 pounds of weight per week, you need to decrease the number of calories you take in per day by 1,000, or expend that extra energy in working out, — which is hard to do! Try cutting 500 calories from your diet and burning 500 calories with vigorous exercise average woman will lose weight on a 1,500-calorie-per-day diet, while men can lose weight on about 1,800 calories per day. I would not go below 1,200 calories per day, however, especially since you are exercising. <br>  <br>  <br>  Dr. Apovian is director of the Nutrition and Weight Management Center at Boston Medical Center and associate professor of Medicine at Boston University School of Medicine.|`|QioaQk1Eaa	WARNING!

You should wait it out, it'll come.|`|6QdtfSQRaa	its not unusual for periods to be late once in a while - or sometimes even skip a peiod, it happens. there are lots of reasons it can be late including stress, illness, weight loss etc. dont worry about it, if you want you can always go to the doc to put your mind at eas, i personally wouldnt worry about it.|`|cWjrtIlKaa	You could just a missed, sometimes this could be cause from increased activity (not necessarily sexual), or stress related. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry about it unless you put yourself in the position to be pregnant.
UZJ7wVc8aa	If you want to gain weight in a good weigh,t you'll need to exercise. If you don't, you'll just get fat. Gaining weight & muscle is a two step process: you have to eat more and lift weights or engage in some sort of strength training routine.<br>  <br>  The most important rule to remember if you want to gain weight is to eat more calories than you burn. Only by doing this can your body use the excess energy to build muscle. If you eat less than you burn, there is no way to gain weight, it's as simple as that. Your first step is to figure out how many calories your body burns per day. Use this calculator <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a>  to get an estimate. Now eat more than you burn and you're on your way to gaining muscle.<br>  <br>  Gaining weight is as simple as eat more than you burn but if you want to gain muscle, you also need to exercise. If you just ate more without lifting weights, you'd just gain fat and become unhealthy and overweight. When you lift weights (or participate in any strength training) you're actually causing some damage to your muscles. <br>  <br>  When you rest, your body uses those extra calories to repair and rebuild the muscles. When this process is complete, the muscle is stronger and a bit bigger than it was before. You obviously won't notice a difference right away, but over time you will find yourself becoming stronger and bigger.<br>  <br>  You need to keep your diet clean to gain the right kind of weight. Stay away from sugary and simple carb foods such as candy, foods made with white flour, soda and other junk. These foods will promote fat storage, something you don't need. Stick to foods made from whole wheat flour, oats, brown rice, lean sources of protein (chicken, some cuts of beef, fish), nuts, beans, legumes and protein shakes - yum yum. If you need more details, go to the Guide to Gaining Muscle -  <a href="http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/gainweight.html" rel="nofollow">http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/g...</a>|`|6jSxYrZnaa	Your diet should be based on lean meat and vegetables. You don't have to worry about amounts - it's impossible to overeat on this kind of food. Lean meat is filling but eat as much as you can. Grains, starches and sugars (the bad carbs) are what makes us store bodyfat. Avoid them completely.<br>  <br>  The people saying you can't gain weight without exercising and without it being fat are wrong. Dead wrong. Couldn't be more wrong if they tried. Body composition comes down to what you eat for the most part.|`|uiGx0rPVaa	NUTRITION!<br>  1. eat organic<br>  2. eat wheat free dairy free gluten free foods<br>  3.

This made me gain weight faster<br>  4. eat small portions of food (Like a small fruit salad, salad, or HEALTHY smoothie) every 3-4 hrs.<br>  5. (I checked your weight and height) and saw that you need to drink about 40 oz of water per day.<br>  6. Take MULTI VITAMINS.<br>  7. Eat LEAN MEAT fish, turkey, chicken breast, and eggs.<br>  8. replace olive oil with grape seed oil<br>  <br>  Vitamin List:<br>  if you're a woman take wheat germ, to limit risk of cervix cancer<br>  <br>  MALE OR FEMALE:<br>  Take BEE Pollen sold in health foods store once a day.

EeRVBRxtaa	I got my braces off last year and umm I never ever noticed them any different until the doctor showed me the old sculpture of my teeth.You'll probably see them in about a month and after he tightens them too becuase he moved the braces position because your teeth moved to a different location you'll probably notice more after he tightens them.And no they don't move when they are tightened they move while you have them on when he tightens it its because they had moved|`|7xc8jgLXaa	your teeth will move VERY gradually. It helps more to take a picture of your teeth and then continue to take pictures at regular intervals (such as once a week or everytime you get the braces tightened) to really see the progress.<br>  <br>  You could ask your orthodontist if your teeth continue to move even though the pain you probably felt from the tightening is gone.|`|pnMjJ3s1aa	you might see it in month after u got ur braces|`|4VOTwqgPaa	It'll be a couple of months before you actually start seeing the changes. They'll be moving for a few days each time they get tightened, then your gums will start getting used to the new position and you'll get them tightened again, and the cycle begins again

25Whzu2waa	Ok, here we go.<br>  <br>  1) Ok, first off, squats are incredible for your legs AND your lower back too. This is how you do it:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYbu_wdleU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PYbu_wdl...</a><br>  You bend down, sticking your *** out, and make your legs 90 degrees at that angle. When you push up, it's through the soles of your feet, and don't rush it.<br>  2) Bench in different ways. Everyone knows how to bench (if not, here:<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4ALL2yls5I)." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4ALL2yls...</a> Do wide-grip, normal grip, and close grip. That'll make your pecs/triceps a lot bigger.<br>  3) Since you only want weights, I can't add in pull-ups, though they're incredible. Do bicep curls PROPERLY (here:<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cwhv315rNt0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cwhv315rN...</a> WATCH WITH SOUND). Don't use any other part of your body than your biceps to hoist it. If you can't anymore, then don't. Plain and simple.<br>  4) Deadlifts will also help the rest of your body (here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHE_Ca-dnoo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jHE_Ca-dn...</a> READ THE DESCRIPTION TOO). Repeatedly pull the bar up like a squat from the ground, then back down again.<br>  5) Last, your shoulders. Overhead presses are excellent for that (here: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sebbhlKhs2E)." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sebbhlKhs...</a> Like the opposite of a pull-up, try and square your shoulder blades back to feel it the most. That'll help shoulders get wider too.<br>  <br>  Running before all of this will provide all the gains you want faster, but since you only said weights, I won't include that in it. If you do all of the exercises correctly also, you will gain muscle flexibility as you go along. WARMING UP IS NOT STRETCHING ALL THE TIME; IT'S DOING LIGHTER WEIGHT BEFORE MOVING ON. <br>  <br>  All reps should be 10 times (if you can't do a certain weight, move down; likewise, if it's too easy, move up), 3 sets.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and good luck. ^_^|`|LreZmTwFaa	if u use a heavy weight that only allows you to do 6-8 reps then that would increase muscle size and strenght.<br>  <br>  Now if you use a lighter weight from which you can squeeze out around 12 reps then that would increase definition along with some cardio too|`|GL920Xv5aa	Military Style.

VsaEOX9vaa	Of course it's normal! That's part of the design of nature to make sure that you enjoy carrying on your purpose of reproduction.<br>  <br>  If it hurt or you didn't enjoy it you wouldn't get the driven urge to find a female and try to make babies. This is why "nature" makes it enjoyable for any species on earth to make babies, it's to keep the species from dying out.<br>  <br>  Just on the "anyone notices" bit, have you noticed how many females' eyes drop to a male's crotch? This is part of nature, too. They need to see if you're going to be able to be possible father for their child.<br>  <br>  This is why males normally look at a female's breasts, will she be a good feeder for our children, we look at female hips, are they good child-bearing hips?<br>  <br>  We can't escape the driven purpose that we are here to reproduce our kind.|`|A1yHDCwxaa	I think so.

SltEwVX7aa	the formula is easy:  you take in more calories than you burn.<br>  <br>  Since you're a growing teen, you probably need to inhale a bunch of calories.  Teens need to eat when they're growing, but usually the urge to eat hits before the growth does.  For others, it's while the growing is happening.<br>  <br>  As with any diet, it takes work on your part, and yes, putting on weight is a diet.  Keep a log of what you eat for the next three or four days.  You'll need to track what, when, and how much.  There are charts on the web that will give you the calorie count of what you ate.  Some food is easy.  Yogurt, for example.  If you eat the whole container, the calories should be on the label.  <br>  <br>  Total your calories for the day.  Then add about 15 percent (check your list and see when you can/could add "seconds".)<br>  <br>  Trust me, you're putting on muscle as you're growing.

VHVkgzKmaa	I am not a big fan of Yasmin to begin with, but yes, that could possible be it. The pill is basically just a dose of hormones that makes your body think it's preganant so it doesn't release an egg. When you took both pills, your body got even more of that hormone, making you yourself feel pregnant and made you experience sickness that goes along with that. If I were you, I would have just waited until 8 pm again to take the next pill.

RUcNozayaa	Good for you! i'm thinking about it as well.<br>  <br>  First off, you can live a healthy life without meat. If you couldn't, then vegetarians and vegans wouldn't be alive. You just have to make sure that you get enough protein from other foods (tofu, nuts, beans, etc)<br>  <br>  Secondly, the only way to lose weight is to burn more calories than you take in. Meat has a significant amount of calories, but if you substitute meat for something of equal caloric value, then you won't lose any weight. By the way, I checked your BMI, and it was 20.4, so you are at a healthy weight. You might just want to tone up, which would require exercise. Exercise creates micro-tears in your muscles, and when they are repaired, your muscles get bigger. <br>  <br>  Also, it might be nice to know that one pound is about 3500 calories.|`|AdBSJYiLaa	amm.. i'm a veggie girl , <br>  but, you don't have to give up with meat!<br>  doesn't matter!<br>  you can loose 3 kgs per week eating it!<br>  just don't too much!<br>  the portion should be like the measure of ur hand<br>  not more not less<br>  excersising 1 hr per day, drinking water.. 2 L<br>  <br>  and y'all do it!<br>  <br>  and eating veggies and meat!<br>  <br>  i eat veggies with fish(salmon,tuna,beans,SOJA MEAT)<br>  <br>  c'mon,, u can do it:)|`|2xONxGv5aa	Not nessicearly.

jRqXZV6Oaa	The two previous answers are correct, it is RNA, not DNA.  But if what you are eluding to is inserting the coding into the cowpox virus in order to make a vaccine, it still won't work. <br>  <br>  HIV is a rather rapidly mutating virus - this means it changes it's code frequently.  If you were to sample the HIV present in infected individuals world-wide, you would find thousands and thousands of individual viral codes.  So by the time scientists would be able to make a vaccine and produce it and administer it, the virus they started with would have changed its code and may no longer be susceptible to the vaccine made.  Besides, it would likely not be effective to the other thousands of viral strains that have mutated to be different form the one they started with.  <br>  <br>  In other words, it just wouldn't work, because even if you got vaccinated against one strain, you could still possible be infected by another strain.|`|ZuYTZ80Gaa	It won't do anything much.<br>  <br>  first off the HIV virus is an RNA virus not a DNA virus.<br>  <br>  If theoretically the new "virus' successfully can implant itself into a cell (which is unlikely since the mechanisms of entry/cell preferences for both viruses are different), and start replicating, it will replicate according to the genetic blueprint.  Hence, you'll end up producing more normal HIV viruses, since that's the blueprint you're going by.|`|eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	Well, HIV is a member of the retrovirus family.  That means it doesn't contain DNA, and it works by inserting it's RNA into the chromosomes of a cell to manufacture DNA.  It also can only enter cells that contain a certain type of transmembrane protein- like that on the T-cells of the immune system.  Cowpox is also a virus, not a cell- and it also lacks DNA.   Think of a virus not as a complete cell, but more like an protein envelope containing letters that belong can be inserted in a chromosome.  You have to insert your virus into a living cell- you can't insert one virus into another one.  If you could manage to combine the two viruses, there's no imagining what you would end up with.  It could prove even more deadly.

U9n960GYaa	The part that is responsible for the creation of the hormone "Insulin"..  In a type 2 diabetic, the insulin that is produced is slowed or the insulin itself is deformed to the point your body cannot utilize it properly.  Insulin is used by the body to "unlock" the cell membrane so the glucose can enter into the cell to be used for energy.  If the insulin is not there or is deformed, the glucose cannot get into the cells and, thus, builds up in the bloodstream..... To much glucose in the bloodstream is known as diabetes..<br>  <br>  Type one is a different story.... it usually starts at a young age and is where the pancreas either produces very little or no insulin at all.  Insulin injections are required for type 1 diabetics.  The cause of the shut down of the pancreas is still a mystery, but many researchers believe it is due to the immune system attacking it...<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you out !!!

Just restrict your calorie consumption to 1,000 a day and do cardio for an hour every day. You'll loose 10- 15 pounds for sure.

Anyway, the burning will pass in a few hours to a day. <br>  <br>  After he urinates a few times, things generally improve. He is allergic to the stuff, and make sure he never uses it again.

AA12208063	You possibly need to eat more.  Too many calories burned and too few consumed does not make for weight loss.  The other possibility is that you are not burning what those machines way.  They way overestimate calories burned.  500 calories in 35 minutes is VERY suspect and I doubt if you are burning about half that.<br>  <br>  Don't just eat light.  Know your portions.  Make sure you get enough protein and fat.  Consider adding a protein shake before and after your workout.<br>  <br>  And get rid of bread, rice, pasta, and potatoes.  Replace them with veggies and meat and the weight will come off.|`|6jSxYrZnaa	Because you're doing it wrong. As Mr Angry says, get your nutrition fixed. No grains, starches or sugars.

It will bind them to fat and if it burns the fat with the toxins you will feel sick.  <br>  <br>  You could try a steam bath followed by a cool shower and/or a colon cleanse.  The skin is the largest eliminating organ the body has that is where the steam bath comes in.  And sometimes a backed up bowel <br>  <br>  Also the egg yoke is very high in cholesterol - the worst type of fat for the body.

RhPNV1ohaa	Exactly - your bowel has been streched way out.  After eliminating you needed a fast for two days and then to slowly start eating food again.  The 8 lbs of backup is just collecting in a streched and weak bowel before it had any time to recover.<br>  <br>  Some deep breathing exercises would help you eliminate more easily as well.  I'm sorry your doc did not understand how to help heal the bowel other than to empty it.  That's a good start but he also needed you to continue to give it a rest for healing purposes.  <br>  <br>  At this point in time I would try to just eat much more on whole foods as grown that you can.  That way you can eat all you want and still have few calories.  Your bowel will recover and you will feel better soon.|`|31gN5L58aa	you need to call your doctor and ask...<br>  it may be a bigger problem than you realise|`|Nq5tE1h0aa	it takes a while for ur new food to get all the way down the tube so to speak|`|wYBur7c7aa	Same thing happened to me, i'm only a teenager though so it could be different for everyone. i had some prune juice, and some type of medicine[sorry i cant think of the name!] and i started to exercise for half an hour and well a few minutes i had no problem.

iwpwC93maa	Very potent hallucinogen that is entirely natural, it is a plant. The main chemical in it responsible for the effects is Salvinorin A. I have smoked it a couple times, but only enough once to actually "break through" (reach desired effects of hallucinating, etc). Basically when you smoke it in a pipe (the main method, or bong etc), you almost instantly feel the effects. Now Salvia is extremely powerful, and legal so far. It COULD possibly be considered THE most powerful hallucinogen, since is can basically change your perception of anything on all levels, meaning ALL senses. It can make you hear things, and DEFINATELY see things, thats the main deal with Salvia. The duration however of the effects is very short. Two, to five, to possibly ten minutes longest, depending on the potency and amount smoked.<br>  <br>  The one time, which was my first time, that I broke through, I was not prepared for the "trip" that it sent me on. I immediately in my mind, with my eyes closed, went back to the place that I bought the Salvia from, and seemed to BE the place. I mean this as in I was a pair of eyes navigating and viewing the interior of the shop via the walls. Then I opened my eyes, and the floor in front of me in my shed was sliding under me as I was sitting, as if I were in a helicopter looking down viewing the ground travelling under me. Anything that was behind me was trailing its colors into a rainbow tunnel void. This is a good example of the power of Salvia Divinorum. It basically cut and paste and mish-mashes perception of reality. <br>  <br>  Now in your case, the relation between this hallucinogen and schizophrenia is unclear. For example though, acid is known to bring out "dormant" psychological disorders like Schizophrenia (google Syd Barrett or Peter Green), and I have never done acid, though I KNOW, I just KNOW, that Salvia is stronger than acid, however Salvia is entirely organic unlike the chemically synthesized LSD. There was however one case, that is used against Salvia to have it made illegal, of a boy who commited suicide following repeated use of Salvia over a certain period of time. According to his journal notes he wrote of his experiences with Salvia, it brought him to the conclusion that "existence in general is pointless". This seems to be so far the only negative occurence associated with Salvia other than having a bad trip, which only last the duration of the effect.<br>  <br>  Personally I never felt changed after using Salvia. Hope this info helps though, I don't think theres much else relevant info I can give other than telling you to keep researching.

6TSwoU3yaa	At 17 a lot of guys are still in the throes of puberty.  It is not all that unusual to find the body chemistry still mixed up.  So the point is you do not need to dispair over the odd things you think are apparent in your body.<br>  Instead, make sure you choose a healthy lifestyle, with lots of outdoor activity that stimulates muscle tone and strong physique.  You need to ensure your circulation is strong, and one of the best ways to achieve that is by walking or running long distances in bare feet.  Wearing footwear does not help the body grow one little bit, and is almost as bad a form of mutilation as circumcision.<br>  So young man, get out there and live a full and happy life.  Be patient if you still have a year or two to deal with some issues, but don't let that hamper you.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	Lol<br>  <br>  <br>  Don't listen to them, you're not necessarily a transsexual just because of big hips.<br>  <br>  Maybe you just got a more female-looking distribution of body fat. It happens. Depending on how severe it is, you might want to bring it up with a doctor. S/he can tell you whether you're just overweight or might have some hormonal imbalance. <br>  <br>  My guess though is that you are fine. Fat or not, those might be the first place where you put on weight, so some exercise might get rid of them. It's worth a try - try the obvious first :)|`|CC6dSdJmaa	You need to consider whether you would feel happier living as a guy, or as a girl.

85e0a1e338cd29e0c7340bdce2fd51d5aa	If the molar that gives you pain has been capped before, suspect a infection in the nerve under the molar cap.Some times x rays will not allow the dentist to see the problem.Chances are it is the tooth and not the jaw unless x ray of jaw shows it is worn excessively.Also suspect a swollen lymph node under the jaw bone toward the back of the jaw.In a swollen condition from bacterial infection you would experience pain when chewing that would make you think it was a tooth causing pain.You may have a scurvy type condition from lack of vitamin D and other vitamins which can cause facial pain in the jaw area .I hope this info helps you recover.

mqXyDTwwaa	Body cleansing and detoxification have been referred to as an elaborate hoax used by con artists to cure nonexistent illnesses. Most doctors contend that the 'toxins' in question do not even exist. In response, alternative medicine proponents frequently cite heavy metals or pesticides as the source of toxification, however no evidence exists that detoxification approaches have a measurable effect on these or any other chemical levels. Medical experts state that body cleansing is unnecessary as the human body is naturally capable of maintaining itself, with several organs dedicated to cleansing the blood and gut.<br>  <br>  Professor Alan Boobis OBE, Toxicologist, Division of Medicine, Imperial College London states that "The body’s own detoxification systems are remarkably sophisticated and versatile. They have to be, as the natural environment that we evolved in is hostile. It is remarkable that people are prepared to risk seriously disrupting these systems with unproven ‘detox’ diets, which could well do more harm than good."<br>  <br>  Highly restrictive detox diets such as Water fasting or the Master Cleanse are not the safest form of weight loss. These diets, if done improperly or for too long, may result in nutrient deficiencies. Of particular concern is lack of protein, which may result in wasting of muscle tissue, due to insufficient amino acids for repair. With less lean muscle tissue, the body's metabolic needs decrease, which hampers weight loss efforts unless calories are lessened further in the diet.<br>  <br>  Finally, while many testimonial and anecdotal accounts exist of health improvements following a "detox", there is a severe lack of quantitative data. And some changes recommended in certain "detox" lifestyles are also found in mainstream medical advice (such as consuming a diet high in fruits and vegetables). These changes can often produce beneficial effects in and of themselves, and it is accordingly difficult to separate these effects from those caused by the more controversial detoxification recommendations.

You don't need to lose weight at this point in your life.  You need to grow into the weight you have.  Weight at the start of puberty is building material your body will need to grow your adult body.  Skimp on building material now, you will have a weakened body later on.

Maybe you just have difficulty dealing with emotions and expressing yourself.<br>  <br>  Autism (now known as Autistic Spectrum Disorder) has three main areas of characteristics. Social, speech and imagination. A developmental speech delay is common in most cases and presents itself in preschool ages. <br>  <br>  Those with Autistic Spectrum Disorder have difficulty understanding what it means to be social and maintain relationships. Simple things you and I take for granted like; how to conduct a conversation or share.<br>  <br>  Thirdly, the imagination is unlike your average person. This can vary from person to person but from experience it is very one dimensional. It's either black or white; no grey area (hence the difficulty in social skills).<br>  <br>  There is almost always a particular skill that someone with an Autistic Spectrum Disorder has. Drawing, maths etc and they excel at this.<br>  <br>  High stress levels; sudden loud noises leave the person confused or scared. A routine is almost always followed in everyday life and everything has it's place. It is a very complex conditon and one that needs sensitivity and patience to deal with.|`|DtGFWUP5aa	Look up Asperger's Syndrome. It is a very high functioning form of autism and these people live mostly very normal lives, but have trouble perceiving nuances, anything not literal, facial expressions, sarcasm and things like that.

I can't even think of healthy chinese food... Salad? lol.|`|GkmeJuwzaa	Well, one of my favorites is just plain old steamed vegetables. If they don't have that get steamed chicken with veggies or broccoli or something. And some places let you get the sauce on the side, so ask for that. Also it's helpful to get a broth soup before your meal and then pack away half your meal. Egg drop, hot and sour, vegetable, and wonton are all good choices. Eat rice SPARINGLY. No fried rice, white rice is okay in small portions. If they have brown rice get that. But try to stay away from fried greasy stuff. Good luck!|`|DgeMlKDaaa	uummm food from chinese restaurants is really unhealthy for you. it has alot of grease and fat in it. i dont even believe their steamed vegetables are healthy.|`|1UID5JtNaa	stay away from fried rice and watch your portions of the rest.  pretty much anything fried in oil is going to have extra calories.|`|cCo0Ivisaa	honey...

Drnpe4T5aa	Fevers tend to go up and down.  It's awful to watch your children when they are sick and there is so little you can do to help...<br>  However, when a viral infection fades and then the illness picks up momentum again, it is suspicious.  I would have him looked at for a possible secondary bacterial infection.  <br>  Your doc can tell if the infection is taking a bacterial turn by doing a blood test (doesn't take a whole lot of blood).  Have your son's ped check his C-reactive Protein (CRP) level.  This is an inflamitory marker in the blood that can give the doc a better idea if your son's flu is still the same or if he is starting to get a secondary infection.<br>  If it were me (I'm a mom of 4:  10 - 8.5, 5, & 17m) I would watch him overnight.  Give Tylenol and Ibuprofen, both if needed.  Make sure to keep track of when you gave him the doses if you do both - Tylenol can be dangerous if overdosed, and that gets easy to do when you are bleary-eyed tired at 3 am.  <br>  I wouldn't risk picking up worse germs in the ER unless his fever really went up overnight or his breathing becomes labored.  But get him in in the morning if you can.<br>  Try to keep his fluids up.  Dehydration can actually make the fever go higher.  Have him drink about 1/2 cup every hour.  <br>  Good luck.  You probably have a long night ahead of you - but try to get some rest.  ;)|`|eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	As long as you can get the temperature down below 102 with Tylenol and Motrin, and he is able to drink fluids, and makes a bathroom call every 3-4 hours- you can just call to check in with the pediatrician.  This is the 3rd day of a virus, which usually lasts betwee 7-10 days.  His immune system is getting ready to mount the major offensive, and elevated temperature is a good first line defense.  The body cells work quite well in the elevated temperature, but the flu virus can't.  It interferes with the virus' ability to replicate, which limits the numbers the body must fight.  Fever is not the enemy as long as you can keep it below 102.  It will not go down to normal until he is more recovered, and you don't necessarily want it to either.  Keep him resting, and just offer easy to eat foods like soup frequently, and push the drinks.   Alternate the Tylenol and Motrin, every two hours, so he's still taking them four hours apart.  He'll breath easier in a cooler air, and if he's semi-upright.  Have him suck on hard candy to help with the cough, it will provide a steady source of energy as well as help thin the secretions, and bathe that poor sore throat.  If you have a vaporizor or humidifier, that's a good way to add moisture to the air.   Lacking that, a pot of water simmering on the stove will work as well.  They do feel ratty, and miserable, but he should start feeling more human about day 5 or so.  The fever should also start going down closer to normal about then as well.  Of course, depend on your mom alarm.  If it doesn't feel right, take him to see the doctor.|`|3QIWdvG1aa	Usually, you'll need nothing more than bed rest and plenty of fluids to treat the flu. But in some cases, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral medication such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza).<br>  <br>  These drugs, which treat both influenza A and B, work by deactivating an enzyme the virus needs to grow and spread. If taken soon after you notice symptoms, they may shorten your illness by a day or so. Oseltamivir is an oral medication, but zanamivir is inhaled through a device similar to an asthma inhaler and shouldn't be used by anyone with respiratory conditions, such as asthma and lung disease.<br>  <br>  Both medications can cause side effects, including lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and trouble breathing. They can also lead to the development of antiviral-resistant viruses.<br>  <br>  In November 2006, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the maker of Tamiflu to include a warning that people with the flu, particularly children, may be at increased risk of self-injury and confusion after taking Tamiflu. The FDA recommends that individuals with the flu who take Tamiflu be closely monitored for signs of unusual behavior. Discuss possible side effects with your doctor before starting any antiviral medication.<br>  Lifestyle and home remedies<br>  <br>  If you do come down with the flu, these measures may help ease your symptoms:<br>  <br>      * Drink plenty of liquids. Choose water, juice and warm soups to prevent dehydration. Drink enough so that your urine is clear or pale yellow.<br>      * Rest. Get more sleep to help your immune system fight infection.<br>      * Try chicken soup. It's not just good for your soul — it really can help relieve flu symptoms by breaking up congestion.<br>      * Consider pain relievers. Use an over-the-counter pain reliever such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) cautiously, as needed. Remember, pain relievers may make you more comfortable, but they won't make your symptoms go away any faster and may have side effects. Ibuprofen may cause stomach pain, bleeding and ulcers. If taken for a long period or in higher than recommended doses, acetaminophen can be toxic to your liver. Talk to your doctor before giving acetaminophen to children. And don't give aspirin to children or teens because of the risk of Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease.<br>  <br>  Prevention<br>  <br>  These steps can help you stay healthy, even at the height of flu season:<br>  <br>      *<br>  <br>        Get an annual flu vaccination. The best time to be vaccinated is October or November. This allows your body time to develop antibodies to the flu virus before peak flu season, which in the Northern Hemisphere is usually December through March. However, getting a flu shot later in the flu season may still protect you. It takes up to two weeks to build immunity following a flu shot.<br>  <br>        Keep in mind that the flu vaccine doesn't offer complete protection, especially for older adults, but it can reduce the risk and severity of illness. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), when the match between flu vaccine and circulating strains of flu virus is close, a flu shot is between 70 and 90 percent effective in warding off illness in healthy people under age 65. It is less effective in older adults. Health experts recommend vaccinations for people over 50 because the flu shot may reduce the risk of flu-related complications, hospitalizations and deaths.<br>  <br>        Healthy people ages 2 to 49 alternatively may receive the flu vaccine via a nasal spray called FluMist. It protects against the same strains of influenza that the flu shot does. Like the flu shot, FluMist is given every year. Because FluMist contains live, but weakened, flu viruses, it shouldn't be given to pregnant women, people with weakened immune systems and those with chronic illnesses. A study published in 2006 found that FluMist was only between 30 and 57 percent effective in preventing the flu in adults. However, another study in 2006 found that giving nasal spray vaccine to school-age children helped to reduce the spread of flu in the community. And in 2007, researchers compared the effectiveness of FluMist with the flu shot in children ages 6 months to 5 years. The children treated with FluMist experienced about half as many cases of flu as did those treated with the shot. However, FluMist increases the risk of wheezing in this age group — especially in those who already have asthma or recurrent wheezing and in all children under age 2. In 2007, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) therefore approved FluMist for children older than 2 years who don't have asthma or recurrent wheezing. Consult with your doctor about which form of vaccination may be best for you or your child.<br>  <br>        You can get the flu vaccine from your doctor, at public health centers and many pharmacies. In some areas, flu vaccines are also available at senior or community centers and at supermarkets.<br>      * Wash your

As long as we are talking about normal quantities of caffeine and alcohol.<br>  <br>  <br>  Like, you didn't have 25 venti cappuchinos and you're gonna wash it down with a bottle of 151, right? <br>  <br>  You're fine.|`|aG0fIRV3aa	okay, im sorry but<br>  all alcohol is harmful!<br>  and yes it will harm you!<br>  not for the fact its mixed<br>  but for the fact your drinking<br>  it at all.  now im not<br>  saying drinking is stupid,<br>  im just telling you, this<br>  question, is dumb to put on here<br>  because the fact<br>  it seems like your asking if alcohol<br>  is harmful.<br>  and i dont think it matters..<br>  but yes it will harm your body<br>  in the case your drinking it at<br>  all!<br>  <br>  so okayy:)
FicyC2TXaa	He should consult the hospital at once.<br>  <br>  Pain is not  a normal side effect of chemotherapy, and withdrawal is not a possibility.|`|51jR2Lmlaa	It is spelled chemotherapy, other than that I don't know much about it.|`|d5dKlgEPaa	Its just the effect of the medicine. It is very hard on your body, and its going to be a long strugle for them. It can be very painful, can make you very sick, and weak, it really takes alot out of you.|`|rGMv0AMtaa	*Chemo Therapy<br>  <br>  It is literally a poison they pump into your body.  The idea is to kill the cancer cells, however the body takes a huge toll.  They have meds they can give to aide in the pain...|`|r97pNcztaa	well first of all its CHemotherapy, and it takes all your hair off (sometimes), but basically it kills any cells that multiply (like your hair)|`|CNZn1qhJaa	I believe it's called "chemo" therapy...|`|sH9lfyeNaa	Sorry, I have two friends that are very close to me, one had chemo and the other one had chemo and radiation both.  The one who had just the chemo had the same effect, and he called the hospital and told them, they gave him some kind of shot that made him better, and it helped with his appetite.  My other friend had a tumor that was growing around his asaphagus and he was unable to swallow, however, he did not have the pain, but they put a stint in his esophogus so he could eat.  His appetite was completely ruined and he never got a shot for pain or to help his appetite.  I have not seen my friend that only had chemo, I hear he is doing well.  My other friend had surgery and they got all of the tumor, but had to take all of his asophogus and restructure using his stomach.  He can eat now, but very little.  Chemo is a harsh remedy as well as radiation, they both hurt and sometimes they are not successful.  I hope that your kin comes through and all is well.  I guess some people have pain and some people don't.  Even without the pain, my friend had no taste for food, he said everything tasted horrible, so he survived on protein and health drinks only because he knew he had to have substinance.  I wish I could answer your questions with definites, but when it comes to cancer and the various treatments, there are no definites.  Ask your kins doctor, or even the nurses, they should be able to help.  I'll be praying for you and yours.|`|z0torDIWaa	The pain is common with chemo. My uncle went through it and unfortunately lost his battle. But the chemo is physically and mentally enduring.  One because of the actual chemical being drained into your system. Two becuase of the fact that it is a long time, sometimes over an hour, most of the time a lot longer. Because of this a person may feel tired and have pains.  Also, since he/she is just beginning the chemo treatment, their body is not used to it. Have them consult their doctor to see if they could take an aspirin to reduce pain/swelling. Be sure that they do consult a doctor, that is very important.|`|zqWKHbcmaa	it's hard to say because chemical, radiation , "and cancer" all cause pain potentially<br>  <br>  .. i did know an old lady who was fortunate enough to have the cancer eat away at the part of her brain that processes pain though ... sorry that probly doesn't help you much|`|K119R72Caa	cemo can be pain and very sad to see but the over all effect is just to try to make the person better.

I remember when I first got mine it once took 4 months for me to get another one. In fact, mine were irregular up until I was 17 (although they didn't take AS long to come) and started taking birth control for acne. If it wasn't for that, they would probably still be messed up.

So it's all good.|`|cbuVCw97aa	yeah..you're body is still trying to regulate its self and your period won't come on every month like you expect it to, so just sit & relax, it'll come on soon enough, and don't worry, if the problem still persists more after 3 or 4 months from now, then you may want to consult a doctor..hope everything works out fo the best.|`|L1GmfZYOaa	sounds like you have hormonal imbalances... you need to see your doctor to regulate it.

Along with eating healthy,  workout every day, wear a garbage bag over ur upper body, under a t shirt and sweeater, tucked into ur pants, run on the track or treadmill for 15 minutes, then walk for 45 minutes, do this every day for two weeks, make sure to drink a full glass of water after every time, with one teaspoon or sugar and one teaspoon of salt. Then to drink alot of water regularily, after doing this (4x a week) for two weeks, then just workout 4x a week no garbage bag, id reccomend 20 min on the treadmill, 10 min walking on an incline. Also a trick is to put preperations H on ur stomach and buttock, it sucks out extra water and toxins, U could also take these pills called red devils, they are illegal but they work, u have to take them early morning and they help to loose weight. <br>  <br>  These are all unhealthy and stupid ways to loose weight. <br>  <br>  I did the garbage bag thing, for one week straight, i felt like **** after each workout, so exhausted and just terrible. I didnt loose weight, but the second week i just did regular workouts then suddenly i dropped 5 pounds and my stomach is loose. i wasnt fat to begin with it was more of an experiment, but i dropped 5 pounds in a 10 day span. However i felt sick most of that time, my legs ached to all hell from the 50 min of walking and my body was just a mess. But my legs were so toed after etc....and my stomach is flat as hell now
hzWtMS3zaa	Depends on what she was going through. I assume something very bad by the way she is acting. I don't think you were being selfish, but missing the good times you two had together. She seems depressed about something, send her a letter or leave her a message saying that you love her and that you really do miss her. Tell her why you feel bad and that you wish her well.<br>  <br>  What you're feeling is totally normal. I've been through something like this before, too. You haven't been bad or anything to her, it seems. Try not to beg her, though. She may feel like you are being annoying, when you seem to be trying to help.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you and your friend.|`|Yu7y6yfraa	You are not crazy.  You are not bad.  You sound very normal.  Jealousy is one of the most painful emotions a person can feel.  Throughout history many people have killed themselves and others over it.  Of course, I do not recommend that you do this.<br>  <br>  The best thing for you to do is to give your friend her space.  No person want to feel smothered; and, everyone needs their own room.   Also, if she needs her space, she does not have to explain herself to anyone.  No means no whether it comes with an explanation or not.  <br>  <br>  Work on makin new friendships and maybe devoping some new hobbies.  If she is a true friend, she will start wanting to do things with you again.|`|a8Pq2Lmdaa	What you did was normal.  Since you already apologized there is not much you can except wait.

If you really want to know what is going on with her than ask her nicely...but do not push her....pushing can sometimes make it worse.. If you still wish to be her friend....ask for forgiveness, be sincere and relaxed, promise her you will do what she asks this time.....see what she says.|`|4qPpgop2aa	You shouldn't feel ashamed.

3QIWdvG1aa	What causes meningitis?<br>  <br>  Viral meningitis is caused by viruses. Bacterial meningitis is caused by bacteria.<br>  <br>  Meningitis can also be caused by other organisms and some medicines, but this is rare.<br>  <br>  Meningitis is contagious. The germs that cause it can be passed from one person to another through coughing and sneezing and through close contact.<br>  What are the symptoms?<br>  <br>  The most common symptoms among teens and young adults are:<br>  <br>      * A stiff and painful neck, especially when you try to touch your chin to your chest.<br>      * Fever.<br>      * Headache.<br>      * Vomiting.<br>      * Trouble staying awake.<br>      * Seizures.<br>  <br>  Children, older adults, and people with other medical problems may have different symptoms:<br>  <br>      * Babies may be cranky and refuse to eat. They may have a rash. They may cry when held.<br>      * Young children may act like they have the flu. They may cough or have trouble breathing.<br>      * Older adults and people with other medical problems may have only a slight headache and fever.<br>  <br>  It is very important to see a doctor right away if you or your child has these symptoms. Only a doctor can tell whether they are caused by viral or bacterial meningitis. And bacterial meningitis can be deadly if not treated right away.
OO46VOIhaa	It is possible for a doctor to do it alone, that's how it was when my friend had his but most likely you will need an anesthesiologist, depending on what type of anesthesia they use.  There doesn't have to be a nurse but sometimes they want one anyway.  I hear they like to have a nurse there to hold your penis out of the way but there are much better ways to do it.  If you tell the doctor you don't want a nurse he probably will do it without one but if the doctor thinks it's necessary than make sure it's a male nurse.  Although it's unethical and disgusting they quite often try to send a female nurse in but you can insist that they don't.  If the doctor is too arrogant to honor your request remember that qualified doctors are a dime a dozen.  Find another one.  But you MUST be FIRM.  A woman does not belong in that situation.|`|4jYg8k0Qaa	As you can see, some doctors do this alone and others use an assistant.  Mine had a physician's assistant.<br>  <br>  Why do you "need" to get a vasectomy?  I ask because you should be sure to consider all of the risks associated with vasectomy.  For most men, it works out well, but for those (like me) that develop congested epidiymides, sperm granulomas, leakage, and entrapped nerves, it can be a very painful and life altering decision.  Mine resulted in a medically-necessary reversal which relieved much but not all of the aches and pains that I'm still nursing 4 years later.<br>  <br>  Again, I'm not opposed to vasectomy since it's clear that most men end up OK with it.  But, the incidence (or even existence) of Post-Vasectomy Pain Syndrome is kept hidden from most men by the urological community (where urologists pull down $10k every Friday afternoon) and Planned Parenthood.<br>  <br>  Get the facts and assess your own personal risk factors and odds of having a successful or PVP-laden vasectomy.  I wish I had looked into it more carefully, as I possessed several well-documented risk factors (high sperm count, prior hernia, over-active immune system to name a few).|`|uM2IZBobaa	The doctor doing my vasectomy had a nurse to assist.  It was a female nurse, but I really didn't care if she saw my package or not.  I am just average when it comes to size, but I have never been self conscious about this aspect of my life.  You are probably never going to see them again any way so why worry over it?|`|0vLWaGeraa	You don't have to "hope" it's a man.  Tell them you will only accept a man.  A vasectomy is an easy procedure so there are probably many in your city that can do it.  If your doctor doesn't cooperate then go to another.

AA10450066	I think about body temperature.If you blow smoke into your hand is it hotter than your body?
mqXyDTwwaa	There's no way to tell. Weight loss depends on total calories consumed, not certain foods eaten. If you gave up bread, pasta, and meat for 40 days, but ate 10,000 calories of other foods, you'd gain weight. If you ONLY ate bread, pasta, and meat for 40 days, but the total calories eaten were less than the total calories burned. You'd lose weight.
goch9Twpaa	Hi, and yes it works!<br>  As the threat of cancer amplifies, more and more individuals start to seriously consider cleaning their colons. Moreover, the medical society is similarly in the same quest of unraveling the solid steps on how to clean the colon to ensure a perfect health.<br>  <br>  Understanding How Colon Cleansing Works<br>  <br>  Throughout our lifetime, you eat a variety of foods regardless of their nutrient contents. The digestive system itself contains at least two gallons of body fluids, liquids, and food. Since these substances may be too much for the colon to handle, some of which line up the colon and fail to be released.<br>  <br>  As a result, you suffer from constipation, colon blockage, and then health degradation. Thus, the best mandatory option that you must stick with is to flush out all of these substances. There are times when your body system doesn't react to the natural method of flushing out your feces so it's time that you seek the best colon cleanser.<br>  <br>  How to Pick Out the Best Colon Cleanser<br>  <br>  There is basically a spectrum of colon cleansers out in the market and you'll just end up confused if you don't start on the right track. Here are a few insights that would help you pick out the best colon cleanser amidst the multitude of products.<br>  <br>  Go all-natural. Be sure that the colon cleanser product is made up of genuinely organic components.<br>  <br>  Look into its fiber content. The regulation of your bowel movement would be more enhanced by fiber. Generally, you'll need lots of it!<br>  <br>  Assess its benefits. Among the benefits which you should look into include the following, relief from constipation and bloating, supports the elimination of organisms, aids in the cleansing of the intestinal tract, and promotes the general health of the internal organs.<br>  <br>  If you are looking for the best natural colon cleansing product, i highly recommend checking out the source link!<br>  <br>  Good Luck ;)|`|fCUnZPnwaa	I have been having a problem in my colon for many years. I have tried many thing′s to get my health back. I talked to many doctors, tried many drugs, but nothing workd for me, until I stumbled on a natural colon cleanse called Bowtrol. I started to take it few weeks ago and I can tell you that today I feel a lot better in all my body. I′m not telling you that I am fully cured but I feel a lot better.

A woman gets pregnant from a man's sperm penetrating her egg.  If he just had a tiny bit of ejaculate on his hand you're almost certainly not pregnant, since the vaginal fluids are pretty acidic (poisonous to sperm), so a lot of them die off.  Then they have to split into two groups if they make it to the fallopian tubes, where your egg most likely is.  The little swimmers would THEN have to find the egg - pretty difficult since there is no force of attraction between sperm and egg.  Your chances of being pregnant are slim.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|ZuYTZ80Gaa	With any genital contact there is a small theoretical risk (ie. if during fingering there was some semen on his finger).  It's likely that it's something else that's causing the delay in your periods but it's something that you should rule out (ie. take a pregnancy test) or see a doctor (who will likely first make you do the same thing)|`|ttsn24hfaa	the only ways you can get pregnant is from having sexual intercourse and getting it medically injected so no you cannot b pregnant|`|16bWGB14aa	You can't be pregnant from getting fingered and it's normal for teenagers to have an irregular cycle.
Eec9JeXbaa	hmm, if you're not pregnant, which you should check by blood test, if home tests are negative... maybe the pill you're on is no good for you.<br>  <br>  Sometimes they stop your ovulations and stop periods completely. Which is not good. I know few friends with the same problem, they switched the brand of the pill and got their period pack..<br>  <br>  Go and spk to your doctor about it.|`|EZLtESP1aa	I take Aviane also! I was taking Lutera but my Target pharmacy doesn't carry it so they gave me Aviane. To be honest, I liked Lutera better, since ive been on Aviane, I feel a heavyness almost like cramps or gas..Lutera didnt do that to me. But remember also, the longer you are on a pill there is a chance your period can disappear. If the doctor says your okay its probably just gonna come once in awhile now. Good luck|`|EMbaak9waa	Get your doctor to give you a blood test and a ultrasound. That may help.|`|jrWpHYAPaa	Have you been taking the pill continuously without taking any of the placebo pills (no hormone)? If you take them without stopping one week for your period you won't get a period.<br>  <br>  And are you still on the pill? If you stop taking the pill in the middle of the month, you can totally mess up your cycle.<br>  <br>  The pill usually gives you lighter and shorter periods anyways.<br>  <br>  Usually lower back pains is a symptom of pregnancy.
82JPSNwpaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Ok, 100 push ups and 100 crunches per day, what will this achieve and even if you really could do it? Drinking a lot of water what would this achieve? The answer not really a lot.<br>  <br>  It seems perhaps your a bit insecure about your physical appearance, welcome to being a teenager. Your body type is very much genetically determined so there is not a huge amount you could do to change it. Attempting that exercise will result in you just strengthening your triceps and abdominal a bit but it wont get you ripped. Maybe if your suggesting that you need to eat healthier this is worth doing and may be partly responsible for your smaller body frame.<br>  <br>  Whats your running like, successful runners tend to have smaller body frames so maybe you give this a try. Its certainly a better way to get in shape than what your suggesting and will help build up and tone muscle around your body.|`|6jSxYrZnaa	Very little would happen.|`|tIldpr7vaa	no, u need to workout with weights to build muscle, hundreds of crunches and pushups will do little if anything.<br>  Also u need to eat alot of good protein rich foods.|`|j2gDHCSyaa	FOR THE MOTHEROFLIVINGHELL<br>  OF COURSE YOU WILL!!!!!!!<br>  CRUNCHES MAKE U GAIN MUSCLE<br>  DO 100 PUSHUPS,100SITUPS,&LIFT SOME WEIGHTS FOR 10 MINUTES FOR EACH SIDE.

XhirXRkpaa	It's hard to tell where you would place with those times--there are too many variables.  However, it sounds like you are turning into a fast runner.  The 400 is probably one of the hardest races to run, and you are already getting pretty good times.  Keep up the good work.|`|01bd66fcd1adbf6b22cf0169df571d8aaa	I only did track in high school, so these might be a little fast for you, but a good 100m is under 13 sec... but your 400m looks good, so you should try for middle distance (400 and 800m) since most middle distance runners are not very good sprinters, just like I was never good at anything longer than a 200m =)
AA12208063	No.  You are better off just fasting for 1-2 days and drink water.  There is nothing magic about the lemon water diet and without protein your body will eat your own muscle tissue.  So one week is a bad idea.<br>  <br>  Either fast no more than 1-2 days with water or eat healthy and light (veggies, lean meat, etc.) and drink lots of water for about a week.<br>  <br>  I get bloated sometimes and eating clean and drinking lots of water always fixes it.|`|mqXyDTwwaa	Body cleansing and detoxification have been referred to as an elaborate hoax used by con artists to cure nonexistent illnesses. Most doctors contend that the 'toxins' in question do not even exist. In response, alternative medicine proponents frequently cite heavy metals or pesticides as the source of toxification, however no evidence exists that detoxification approaches have a measurable effect on these or any other chemical levels. Medical experts state that body cleansing is unnecessary as the human body is naturally capable of maintaining itself, with several organs dedicated to cleansing the blood and gut.<br>  <br>  Professor Alan Boobis OBE, Toxicologist, Division of Medicine, Imperial College London states that "The body’s own detoxification systems are remarkably sophisticated and versatile. They have to be, as the natural environment that we evolved in is hostile. It is remarkable that people are prepared to risk seriously disrupting these systems with unproven ‘detox’ diets, which could well do more harm than good."<br>  <br>  Highly restrictive detox diets such as Water fasting or the Master Cleanse are not the safest form of weight loss. These diets, if done improperly or for too long, may result in nutrient deficiencies. Of particular concern is lack of protein, which may result in wasting of muscle tissue, due to insufficient amino acids for repair. With less lean muscle tissue, the body's metabolic needs decrease, which hampers weight loss efforts unless calories are lessened further in the diet.<br>  <br>  Finally, while many testimonial and anecdotal accounts exist of health improvements following a "detox", there is a severe lack of quantitative data. And some changes recommended in certain "detox" lifestyles are also found in mainstream medical advice (such as consuming a diet high in fruits and vegetables). These changes can often produce beneficial effects in and of themselves, and it is accordingly difficult to separate these effects from those caused by the more controversial detoxification recommendations.|`|eb603a32531b733c208d6a3685da0228aa	No, it doesn't work.  Nothing you can drink or eat will magically cleanse your colon, and truthfully you don't need to do it anyway.  Your colon is set up to be a self cleaning system, and all you have to do to keep in in good working order is to eat properly.  That means eating a well balanced diet of real foods.  While lemonade is a fair source of vitamin C, you'd have to sweeten it just to be able to drink it.   Vitamin C is water soluble, meaning what you don't need for that day gets filtered out by the kidneys and flushed away.  The same for the water, which makes up most of lemonade.  The sugar gets converted to glucose for use, or stored as fat.  That's about all lemonade is, and all it can do for you.  You are not a walking bag of toxins and waste, anyway.  While you can remove true toxins, like heavy metals from the body- the process of chelation requires some really nasty chemical mixes that must be given via an IV, in hospital, and while you are monitored closely by doctors who know what they are doing.  That process is also really hard on the liver and kidneys, as well.  Otherwise, if you wish to do yourself and your colon a favor, just return to normal healthy eating habits.  Your colon will do the rest.  Skip on the faddish cleanses.  Most are just expensive laxatives, and diarrhea is not anyone's friend.  It does away with the good bacteria you need for proper digestion, as well as what few unfriendly gerbies you  may have.  It upsets and stresses the body far more than it benefits you.  Stuff like the clay preps are just crazy.  Kaolin is not absorbable by the body, and it tends to make you constipated anyway- which is why kaolin puts the Kao in Kaopectate.  You know, the stuff you take for combating diarrhea??  If you really feel bloated from too much salt ans such, drink lots of water based fluids and go easy on the salt and sodium.  Eat your fresh fruits and veggies, peels and all.  Eat wholegrain foods, and go easy on red meat and refined foods.  That is what your body is designed to use, and what will do the most good for you.|`|ZqXUduJMaa	It's not lemonade you are supposed to drink, it's just lemon juice in water - no sugar! And a week is too long for your first fast. It should be three days max!<br>  <br>  Ease into the fast by not eating or drinking anything unhealthy for a week - no fast food, no soda, only good unprocessed food. Then quit meat and dairy for two days before, and the last day, eat only vegetarian soups.<br>  <br>  Then you can fast for two or three days, drinking only water with lemon juice.. You might feel very weak, so do this over a weekend, when you don't have to go to work or school.<br>  <br>  Then ease back into foods by starting with the soups - basically reverse the week before.<br>  <br>  Detoxifying will cause you to feel sick, and may cause your skin to break out.|`|BwJOeHDEaa	no..its not, the best thing that works to cleanse your body is just drink alot of water and eating hella fiber and raw veggies, and if you want to you can use a fiber supplement of metalucil or something like that|`|uiGx0rPVaa	That lemonade thing really works. But don't take it 24/7. If you do, you'll get ill. Take it when absolute necessary.

Diets like this are very bad for your body, forcing it to work extra hard to process fat for energy, so I doubt it'll have much time to focus on removing toxins.  Your body has natural processes for this, so don't mess around with them.  They work just fine by themselves.  Just eat less, eat organic, and try to eat more fruits and veggies.  Your body will get rid of the toxins by itself.|`|01bd66fcd1adbf6b22cf0169df571d8aaa	I'm not sure if having diarrhea for a week straight is all that cleansing, well I guess your bowels, but I'm not sure if that is very healthy either. Just eat more fruits or other fiber rich foods as well as more greens, that will help and be healthy!|`|f68vMXQNaa	Actually its called the "master cleanse diet" which is water + lemon juice + cayenne pepper + maple syrup.

4BBjhHAnaa	Antibiotics are for bacteria.<br>  <br>  All flus are viruses.  No virus can be combated with antibiotics, they are completely different organisms.  The only weapon the medical world has against viruses is vaccines.<br>  <br>  A vaccine introduces a small amount of the pathogen to your body so that it can learn to fight it on its own and consequently build the necessary t-cells.  The problem there is diseases that come in many different strains that are not similar enough for one vaccine to teach our body how to fight all the strains.|`|ZuYTZ80Gaa	Antibiotics target bacteria only by messing with their cell structures<br>  <br>  Bird flu is a (inflenza) virus, and doesn't have the same cell structures, hence you cannot use antibiotics.

They can be used to treat various problems like to straighten , to lengthen teeth or to reduce a gummy smile . <br>  <br>  For more information<br>  Check <a href="http://www.gadkarisclinic.com/dental-veneers.htm." rel="nofollow">http://www.gadkarisclinic.com/dental-ven...</a>|`|oRxjZ606aa	Internal bleaching would be the best option to lighten your natural tooth.  This requires simply reopening the tooth where it was opened for the root canal, and placing a bleach soaked cotton pellet for a week or so.  The process may have to be repeated several times.  I have had moderate luck with this.  A crown or veneer would be the other option. These can be shaded to match your other teeth.  These are a bit more expensive and will likely need replacing every 10-15 years.  Internal bleaching is the most conservative and cheapest approach, but it does not always work.
BILIAKSOaa	It's okay. Tell her to eat right. You can look up diets online. My grandma is actually overweight. She lost 30 pounds so far off this really good diet. Go to a nutritianist and talk to her. Maybe she can make up a plan for your mom. For exercise by the Wii Fit. It's easy, fun, and active. I've heard about a lot of people loosing weight from using this game. There are choices of baseball, bowling, tennis, golf, and boxing. If you don't like that she can always start walking for a little bit and once it gets easier she can increase her time. Maybe in a couple months she can start running ! Hope I helped & good luck.

The amount of loss, of course, will vary from individual to individual.<br>  <br>  The main reason is that Metformin slows down the production of glucose in the liver so the amount in your bloodstream is lower, thus, you burn up what you have faster and in turn, you lose weight...

iOugBxLTaa	I wouldn't suggest you to run at 5am. It's a little too early. If it was me, I would want more sleep. And remember, sleeping is healthy. Also, a mile is a little too short. I normally run a least 3 miles per day, if not, two. Just eat a lot, sleep a lot, and exercise a lot, and you'd be fine. Don't worry on losing weight, worrying on being healthy. 140pounds and 6,2" sounds pretty healthy to me. So, keep it going!|`|6jSxYrZnaa	You are 6ft 2", 140lbs and "pretty buff" in the upper body? I don't think so. Someone like you should not be thinking about losing weight.<br>  <br>  Get some chow down you.|`|844DGAMmaa	That's not a workout, you need to develop a solid routine to start seeing results. <br>  <br>  The running is good, look into HIIT to enhance it, and try to go further than a mile. Lifting weights will not help you lose weight in any way, but you should lift heavier. Try lifting 40-50lbs for a shorter period of time. Your muscles will develop faster than lifting 20lb. bells.

CC6dSdJmaa	Yes, it is known as 'Blue Balls'<br>  Blue balls is the slang term for a congested prostate or vasocongestion, the condition of temporary fluid congestion in the testicles and prostate region caused by prolonged sexual arousal in the human male. It is often accompanied by a cramp-like ache of prostatic congestion and pain/tenderness or edema of the testes.|`|lQ8p2QKkaa	No, it's not true.

Usually when a guy is close to ejaculating but can't for whatever reason (like his masturbation session was interrupted) he gets something called blue balls, or testicular congestion. This is a painful cramping feeling in the stomach and balls, but it does go away.|`|COAngXmKaa	It doesnt get painful unless he has gone days without ejaculation, then the prostrate glan begins to swell causing an uncomfortable sensation. Also it can be painful if he has an erection and doesnt masturbate, the penis gets too hard and this can be uncomfortable too|`|etmtgJ7maa	If a guy is really horny and doesn't do something about it sometimes irritation in clothing can be really annoying but absolutely not painful....|`|vucMO9Glaa	Maybe if you run into a wall or something and it's still "pointing" out.

nF0Eaa2Gaa	Women are affected more because the vagina provides the perfect environment for it to thrive on. Men rarely have symptoms except for the strain that causes genital warts.<br>  <br>  The immune system can keep most strains under control and symptoms go away after a year or two unless you have a strain that causes cervical cancer. But keep in mind that there's no cure for HPV so once you get it you'll become a carrier and can still pass it to others even if you don't show symptoms just like herpes. More than 80% of the sexual population has a strain of HPV which is why doctors are so nonchalant, it's very common.|`|QtJH37KRaa	I have to get paps every 3 months for 2 years. I have HPV as well. Your body usually takes care of it by its self. Oddly enough I am in school almost done to be an GYNO. You can not spread most types of HPV unless its warts. Most women are at risk, and most men have it already, yet there is no test they can take. Don't over react he is fine, and should be until you are cleared up, you are are that worried about it use protection until you feel more comfortable. <br>  I felt the same way until the chapter on Hpv  last year lol.
6k5fhFyBaa	You're not supposed to use q-tips in the ear canal. See a physician to have your ears irrigated and examined to make sure there is no damage. You're probably using the q-tip too hard or you may have a scratch inside your ear.|`|GQTaKHCvaa	You probably scraped it too hard. You're not actually supposed to put stuff in your ear.|`|TiJ9ZISGaa	you are not supposed to clean your ears ever other day, or every day. it dries them out to much.

xBd96wvRaa	First have a blood test to make sure the staph infection is no longer in your blood /system. <br>  <br>  My count was up for over a year before it no longer showed traces, during that time my joints especially in my hands.<br>  <br>  Try immobilizing your wrist for a week or two with a brace, like one of those cast like ones that has Velcro. You may have used it to quickly and not given it enough time to completely heal. <br>  <br>  Take Alleve to decrease the swelling - not long ago the active ingredient was available only with a prescription. The swelling with only hinder the healing process.|`|OGbxnRkjaa	This could be a result of ongoing infection or it could simply be a result of the injury itself.  Lets face it...you have been operated on and have had that part of your body immobile for a long time.  There is bound to be stiffness and pain in the surrounding joints.  I also wouldn't be surprised if you develop carpal tunnel as a result.  Talk to your doctor about getting on a good anti-inflammatory and pain medication.  Mention 'Meloxicam' and see if your ortho doc thinks it could be right for you.<br>  <br>  Best wishes!

Just finishing up here first, then I'll be off. There's plenty of point to going to bed. REST is one of them.|`|pLacTaMPaa	There is a temporary way out, you should top up with full 'nights' of sleep to prevent the negative impact on health - but for long periods it is possible to use a method employed by emergency service operatives - notably firefighters in the USA combatting forest fires would do a short shift of a couple to three hours, then take a fifteen to thirty minute break - still they sleep, and probably at the threshold of fatigue powerful enough to make them sleep if they try avoid it - but by all accounts the method works and much more time spent using wakefulness in ratio to time resting can be drawn upon like an extra reserve.<br>  <br>  Again, must stress actually resting fully in a bed for eight hours or more to get the full benefit....<br>  <br>  I have to admit there's a really nice feeling you get when you're so tired you need to prop your eyelids up with matches - cannot rightfully say whether a desire to experience that makes a person a 'sleep anorexic' though....|`|WzKrZoHQaa	I think you can't go for more than 11 days without sleep otherwise you go mad or even die.  You HAVE to sleep in order for the body to repair itself and for you to dream - everyone dreams in order to keep themselves sane - no joke, even though you may not remember it you dream nightly.   If you just want to kip on the sofa and not go to bed them fine but you still got to sleep.|`|asAWGIgnaa	me it is a waste of time, and i could do so much witht the time i spend sleeping lol. but i do love sleep i couldnt live without it, actually no one could literally, but it is lush, i love it.!!!|`|aYoscopKaa	Rest, chill time.

jgRRsG8Daa	I wouldn't know whether this is a mental disorder or some sort of aberration but this brings to mind a nice yarn which I shall proceed to narrate as this seems to be the right time for it.<br>  There was this guy John who was in need of money.So he asked his friend Joe to lend him five grand with the promise that he would repay <br>  the amount exactly two months thereafter.After a month John found that he was not going to be able to repay Joe on the due date.He hit upon his friend Jack  on the day the money was due to Joe and borrowed five grand with a promise to repay exactly after two months.<br>  Now with the money he got from Jack he repaid Joe as promised. When the day came for John to repay Jack,he again got the money from Joe with the same promise.Now Joe was impressed with John's prompt repayment and had no hesitation in advancing a similar sum on the day John was to repay Jack.With the money borrowed from Joe ,he<br>  repaid Jack on the due date.Now this arrangement went on,on a regular basis and neither Joe nor Jack had any doubt that the money would be repaid.After a couple of years John got tired of running between Joe and Jack and so devised a new strategy.He got both Jack and Joe together and introduced them to each other.Thereafter he proceeded to instruct them both that on the day the money was due to Joe,Jack should pay Joe the amount and on the day the amount was to be paid to Jack,Joe should pay Jack ,the arrangement to continue indefinitely.<br>  Now,it would be right to ask your helpful friend to fine tune the above strategy so that the arrangement between his two friends,the borrower and the lender can be made permanent on the above lines.|`|L5rUAciZaa	no it is not any kind of disorder.<br>  if u wanna help its called charity<br>  but if u borrow from any one and give a charity,it is called foolishness.<br>  so be good but not foolish,<br>  be confident and dont fear about anything.<br>  have self-confidence|`|gXBPLitzaa	Some ppl are like that.

I tried this but it didn't work for me, although I do know people who did find it helpful. Something else you can look for is a local depression support group- its usually run through a church but there is no religious aspect to it, look out for groups such as Sunshine and showers, they can be advertised in lots of places.  The thing I liked when I went to one was if your feeling low and don't want t talk, you don't have to but if you do want to talk you can and someone will be there to listen.<br>  <br>  Has your brother been put forward for support from your local mental health service? I was put under this scheme and found it really worked for me. It worked to the point, where on Friday I was discharged from their services and taken off of my medication!<br>  <br>  I really hope your brother gets the help he s desperately needs. Hang in there, there is light at the end of the tunnel, all you can do is be there for him and let him know your there if he needs you, even if he just wants to off load his feelings, just listen to him. <br>  <br>  Good luck, if you want to talk feel free to e-mail or IM me.|`|b378fc3361a04779c15bf427c58b87afaa	I have a friend who suffers like your brother, and to be honest, the medication becomes part of the problem.

82JPSNwpaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  If your eating a regular balanced healthy diet then there is nothing more you need to be consuming. You do not need to increase your protein intake because your body only requires a certain amount for regular function and muscle hypertrophy, which can be achieved in a healthy diet. Increasing protein intake above this will just result in your body removing it shortly after.<br>  <br>  Having just read your previous question, maybe you need to address your training regime. Are you performing the appropriate exercise and in the right amount?|`|6jSxYrZnaa	It doesn't really matter if you eat three or five. Just eat as much lean meat and green vegetables as you can.

WRONG! Shes a child. children dont need to wach their weight unless theyre dangerously obese|`|j5rHgDSkaa	Well I was anerexic from ages 11-13 on and off. The best, healthy, way to lose weight is work out. She should run about a mile every day. Then after she runs a quick mile she shouldn't feel hungry until about dinner. Then she can eat whatever her parents serve in moderation. A good way to make sure you don't over-eat at dinner or even breakfast and lunch would be to chew each bites 14 times. It forces you to eat slower and therefore to eat less. And remember to only eat when you are hungry. Only drink water. Healthy foods such as salads, cheese, soups, sandwhiches make you more full faster and more full longer. Hope this helps :)

nY3QnYYAaa	Here's the thing, you've been able to live 21 years without "love" so clearly you can live a fine life without it and not need it ... I know that sounds rhetorical but it's true.<br>  <br>  I think the same thing about society. I have my 2 close friends and I'm satisfied. I don't need a "partner" like society tells me I do.<br>  <br>  I'm not much of a people-person either.  I just don't mesh with the general public: our views are different.<br>  <br>  You're not missing too much. Granted, by design, humans are built to love. I don't go for that though. I have no sex drive what-so-ever and don't want one. I don't need someone to make me feel "complete" like we are told via TV and the like.<br>  <br>  Here's something to consider: you know pain is real. You get punched/slapped/whatever and it hurts a lot. You don't know love is real because it's not a manifestation. It's just an emotion which is a mental mindset. They have pills to alter emotions proving that, well, what we perceive can be changed. However, if we are hurt, we physically feel it and there is evidence.<br>  <br>  No partner means no liabilities/hostages if you are ever put in a situation like that (not very likely, but true).  Yes you will die, we all will. It's a fact. It is real.|`|ISHIDwawaa	yes, love is part of our hierarchy of human needs. <br>  <br>  Do you have sexual attraction to anyone, do you masturbate, do you fantasize about sex, do you have sex? <br>  <br>  If so, then you have a sex drive, and all drives need drive reduction by acting upon the drive. So in essence you will have sex with someone, then you will start to love them. <br>  <br>  Love is a basic human drive just like hunger is. <br>  <br>  Have you got any medical conditions, anything from head aches, to anemia? <br>  <br>  Your lack of drive could easily be an imbalance of nutrients in your diet. <br>  <br>  Have you had any horrible experiences in life related to relationships, anything from parents fighting to your dealings with the opposite sex in general? <br>  <br>  Are you attracted to the same sex? If so your fear of acting upon this out of guilt could be part of the problem as well. If you are attracted to the same sex don't be ashamed of it, many people are born this way. <br>  <br>  Are you just in fear of failure and don't want to act upon your needs because of this? Fear of ultimate failure from death to losing someone is a possibility. <br>  <br>  If we are all just going to die someday then why live, why watch a movie if its just going to end, why go on a roller coaster if the ride just ends, point is all things come to an end. The point of life is to enjoy it for the moment you have it.|`|yE2vM76naa	<a href="http://www.envisionsoftware.com/Management/Maslows_Needs_Hierarchy.html#Social_Needs" rel="nofollow">http://www.envisionsoftware.com/Manageme...</a><br>  <br>  that article might explain a lot.<br>  We need people - we are social creatures, but if our lower order needs are not filled, then our social relationships will still leave us feeling somewhat empty|`|tL5vlITcaa	"Is love necessary for a healthy life?"<br>  Yes,<br>  "am I missing out on what life is all about?"<br>  Partially.<br>  <br>  "Part of be doesn't believe in love and thinks it's just a silly human emotion."<br>  An another fellow misanthrope :D

I imagine if you have diagnoses for depression and anxiety that you have probably been prescribed medication.  Studies show drugs for these diseases work best when used in conjunction with psychotherapy.  <br>  The feelings associated with depression and anxiety can be overwhelming.  No one can expect you to conquer them on your own.  A therapist will be able to help you break down and analyse the root causes of your diseases, and can help you develop a plan for dealing with them a step at a time.|`|qVdvwWUbaa	I usually over-analyze the situation and yes, I do try to solve the situation myself.

IgNADy1Taa	It's impossible to tell whether you are heading towards a more severe disorder - never ever question if you are, just tell yourself that you are NOT becoming anorexic, because affirmations like that will really help to keep your mind sane. Mindpower is an amazing thing! <br>  <br>  From what I can tell, there is no reason why you might be becoming anorexic. I say this because:<br>  - It's true that teenage girls have recently become weight conscious, and strive to be skinny like certain celebrities...and out of my group of highschool friends, 4 out of 6 of us experienced disordered eating and a distorted body image at some point. Out of us 4, 3 are now pretty much fine! (Well...still trying to eat sensibly, and whining about being fat, but really it seems most women of all ages do that at some point!)<br>  - Crash dieting and binging are not necessarily signs of anorexia. Crash dieting, or restricting heavily to 1 meal a day might be the sort of thing anyone might try to lose weight - and binging tends to follow from that. It's not a healthy way to eat, but it is not necessarily anorexia.<br>  - I think there is a common misconception about what anorexia is. It is probably the most severe eating disorder (1 out of 7 anorexics end up dying from it) and it involves having a distorted body image and also refusing to eat and hating food so much that it goes far beyond crash dieting - and binging is less common among anorexics because much of the time they genuinely hate food and can't bear to eat or even look at it. This is why on many "pro-ana" forums, there are girls perhaps similar to you or I who want to lose weight and idolise skinny celebrities, and often they are criticised by people claiming to be "real anorexics" (as opposed to "wannarexics") and they say that if you were truly anorexic you would not be swapping tips about the best appetite suppressant etc. because an anorexic relationship with food is much more severely disordered. Since it is such a severe disease, many anorexics have had traumatising personal experiences which perhaps triggered it, or other mental disorders. <br>  <br>  Even if you never come close to being anorexic (which I truly truly hope), be wary of getting too deep into a general eating disorder (Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified = EDNOS). The category of EDNOS covers eating disorders that do not fall into the category of anorexia or bulimia. It does include people who crash diet and binge and have a distorted body image. However, it seems as if you only want to be skinnier because you think it looks good, as opposed to hating your body because you wrongly think you are fat. To me there's a difference there...again, the majority of young girls nowadays would not hesitate to admit they want to be skinnier, because hardly anyone is naturally as skinny as people like Cheryl Cole! <br>  <br>  I think if you continue to restrict with food intake, your binges might get worse and things might spiral - so if you can, it would be good to stop it now. You do not want to mess up your metabolism at such a young age! And never ever start to think you are too fat, because from your stats you blatantly have no reason to be losing any more weight!|`|Qi7bwkeYaa	You're not gonna be anorexic you eat like a pig<br>  and some days you eat very little thats just bcuz your bodies growing..If you have never done anything about your weight then what is there to worry about..<br>  Plus you are no where near under weight so there you go..|`|CC9MO4AJaa	Normal teenager.  Ask a doctor if you are worried, but you seem to be at a good weight.|`|eRw2MYhgaa	Actually I don't think your in any danger.<br>  <br>  It's not healthy to skip meals but many teenage girls do this and they are not anorexic or have eating disorders.<br>  When you start counting your calories every time you eat and wont go over a thousand a day theres a problem.<br>  Also anorexics hate food.<br>  Well I did when I was.<br>  Almost all of them hate it.<br>  Its all you think about.<br>  Your so obsessed with your own weight and what your eating or what your not eating that you could care less about other peoples weight.<br>  <br>  Many teenage girls are extremely jealous over skinny girls but its normal. <br>  Besides if your 16 and weigh 125 thats perfect :]<br>  keep eating what ever you like and dont worry about your weight.|`|66XYz9HGaa	Clearly you feel kinda weird about your relationship with food, otherwise you would not be asking this question. I think if you're worried about it, it might not be a bad idea to talk to a counselor or someone about it, and see what they say... can't hurt, and you might learn something from the experience. Might as well nip it in the bud if there is any problem instead of letting it develop into something that can be deadly!|`|323b11de615c9e145ce9d2b8cfa82d25aa	It's perfectly alright being that weight because your tall, and being really skinny isn't all it's cracked up to be. I'm 16 5"5 and weigh 90 pounds and I am constantly getting made fun of b/c i'm so skinny. So don't try to be super skinny because you won't look right being that tall. Your fine just where you are.|`|rIx1Mnneaa	I don't think so, because I'm pretty much like you.<br>  I even starve myself for a few days sometimes and only drink water with lemons (without sugar).

I will tell ya this , there is way to much pressure to be skinny and that should come to a stop and disallow models to be to skinny not only for the pressure of girls out there but for more important there health. <br>  <br>  Just like being to obese is bad for heart and health.  Just exercise and eat 5 - 6 small meals a day (if you can,easier said then done sometimes) and you will feel and look great. We have to remember WE CANNOT LOOK LIKE SOMEONE ELSE. We can just make ourselves a healthier look and feel good about ourselves and that's all you need if you like yourself so will everyone else.  No one is perfect and try to remember this a lot of those pictures of models are airbrushed and computer touched up. So relax and be confident and if you like to eat keep going.<br>  <br>  5 7 and 125 lbs is good do not get any smaller , do weights and a bit of cardio and trust me you will stay healthy and look good.|`|pPvLDANFaa	hey.. okay you sound exactly like me. i do the same exact thing.. i'm 20..and it all started when i went to college. On weekdays at school I eat normal..and then as soon as the weekend comes..i go home & binge so much that my stomach hurts. it's literally so disgusting. i always think i'm the only one, but trust me..there are others out there. i keep telling myself that i'll stop but it never works. My doctor said that I am like 'pre-anorexic' and i have overcompulsive eating disorder. I'm constantly obsessed with food & thinking about it all the time. It's not healthy hahah. So if i were you, try going to see a psychologist before it gets worse. you don't want to end up sick honey. good luck & don't worry about it, you're beautiful as you are!|`|AjBpAPpdaa	a slight disorder, don't loose any weight, you sound fine|`|AarbyJRSaa	Normal teenager. When you start telling your parents you already ate, and you didnt, and when you start going to taco bell and ordering everything on the menu and then forcing yourself to throw up. Then you should start to worry. Right now your fine.
ffpdB1tzaa	I'm not a dentist, but it sounds like what your dentist did is remove some decay.  When he removed all the decay he could see the nerves or what is called the "pulp" of the tooth.  When the decay is deep enough that your dentist can see the pulp, that means that the nerve needs to be removed, as opposed to just putting in a filling.<br>  <br>  He then put a temporary filling on the tooth, which serves two purposes:<br>  1.  It helps to calm the tooth down so it is not so painful, which will help until he can remove the nerve.<br>  2.  It protects the inside of the tooth until your next appointment.<br>  <br>  At your appointment next Thursday, he will remove the nerve, which is called a "root canal."   He has to use several tiny instruments to clean the inside of the tooth; that's why it takes a long time.  The dentist will be able to numb you for the root canal with the same kind of injections he gave you before he started the drilling he did today. Many times the dentist will put a numbing injection right inside the tooth during a root canal.<br>  <br>  You should not feel any pain at all during the root canal, maybe just some pressure.  if you do feel pain, let the dentist know right away and he will fix the problem.  <br>  <br>  You can also call a couple of days before your appointment if you are nervous about the procedure and ask for nitrous oxide.  That is a gas you breath in during the procedure which will help make you less nervous.  It also makes the time seem to go more quickly.<br>  <br>  I just had two root canals done this last week, and I am feeling so much better.  There was no pain during the procedure.  I had a little pain afterwards but nothing like the toothache I had before going to the dentist.
0TGpz08paa	Self pity is when you feel sorry for yourself and feel like the world is against you and that you're the victim<br>  Mental Illness is when you really do not feel good mentally and when you really need to seek help from a doctor. <br>  People choose to self-pity themself..mental illness is not something you choose..it's just something that happens|`|2cBdyqUOaa	thers such a fine line - thats why its hard to sometimes diagnose the illness.<br>   :)|`|Lj59lazWaa	Do you mean what's the difference between simply "feeling sorry for yourself" and having depression, where feelings of self pity also occur?<br>  <br>  Depression occurs on a spectrum.  Everyone experiences self pity, but self-pity becomes a serious problem when it is recurring, excessive for the situation that causes it, leads to other negative feelings (i.e. self pity leads to other negative feelings and even actions, such as self-destructive behavior) and impairs your lifestyle or quality of life.|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	I agree with the others - it is the magnitude of it, and whether or not it affects your ability  to live your life.

BUkGcdkJaa	A couple of things you need to check out:<br>  <br>  Bad posture can occur when you lack muscle tissues in the midsection. Your abdominal muscles, obliques and spinal erectors are what support your posture. More muscle density, strength and muscle size will keep your body standing straight up. You would be amazed how much taller you feel after working out for a few months.<br>  <br>  The other thing to do is see a chiropractor. You could have some spinal imperfections that are ruining your posture. Get an x-ray to see if you have a healthy spine. (nice proper curves and healthy vertebrae discs.)<br>  <br>  The other thing is just awareness of course. But you will find you will stand much straighter and taller when your midsection is tight and hard. I know I did.|`|niq3ETl0aa	Stretching, yoga, awareness.

AltO9qZ6aa	You obviously enjoy PE cos I was thrilled that I could use my period as an excuse!<br>  As long as you're not swimming then being on your period will not make any difference! However, if you are swimming then talk to your mum/nurse about tampons. <br>  <br>  As far as holidays going, it can be annoying. Especially if you have a long car journey (I had a couple of bad experiences!) Again, think about tampons if you want, if not just stick with pads (that's what I did!)|`|EkZDP3Oyaa	You really just have to get used to it.  And your next period is kind of a random thing.  Most people have one period and then their next one isn't for a while.  Just make sure you have plenty of pads or tampons and change them before you start your p.e. class to prevent any leaks.  It's really not that difficult.  Just make sure you carry a purse with you and keep a stash with you at all times just in case you start.|`|ZUEFfHkBaa	Omg don't worry! Everyone thinks they can't exercise if they are on their period and this is completely untrue, i have very heavey periods, and i exercise and run about loads when i'm on, i even go on my trampoline! Don;'t worry, as long as you have a thick enough pad on you'll be find, please don't stress!<br>  Are you sure you're eating enough if you haven't had a period for two weeks? That can be seriously unhealthy and you could become infertile if it carrioes on, but don't worry if you're eating healthily, it's probably just irregular periods, good luck ! :):):)|`|DpMnmrK8aa	Every girl goes through this. It can be hard and even want you to skip P.E lessons and things that you enjoy. It is important not to let your period rule your life. Your not alone, I suggest you take extra pads/tampons to school in your bag with you. Even discuss it with your teacher if it is really bothering you, I know its embarrassing but if they are understanding they will understand. Talk to your friends aswell, I'm sure they are in the same boat.<br>  <br>  If you are really that worried, I would talk to your doctor about the options open to you, as they can subscribe things to help you through and even stop your periods for awhile. Don't go to a chemist and abuse the medicines there. Don't be afraid and carry on with your lessons and holidays as normal.<br>  Good Tip: Drinking lots of water will help by making your period lighter and easier to manage with when exercising.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and hope things get better and feel better for you soon. Hope that helped :)|`|LQvvZ5EHaa	all girls think this, so don't worry.<br>  for holidays, if your period does clash, there's medication you can buy that will delay them.<br>  as for p.e, honey, that's something that you can't avoid forever.<br>  there's no reason not to do p.e while on your period<br>  (:|`|zAtQoTwraa	Sorry dear there isn't much you can do about it :(.

Bang1YAraa	First, you need to talk to your dentist. I suggest that you do so in a different day than the one you'll have the fillings done. Before the procedures, of course.<br>  <br>  Tell him you had to take diazepam to undergo the procedures. Trust me, it is more common than you'd imagine the amount of people who need to take some pill to visit the dentist's office.<br>  <br>  Also, you could ask him some information on Nitrous Oxide. It will surely help both of you!|`|n0rJH0l6aa	Can't you have them gas you? That would be a lot easier than a needle. Although in all honesty there is nothing terrible going to happen at the dentist, and all in all its going to save you a lifetime of pain. So just think of all the pain you're being relieved of.|`|SetgMzrAaa	OK listen all you have to do is if you have an i-pod take it to keep you occupied!|`|D3As94Dnaa	Don't cancel the appointment it will hurt more if you don't get it. Befour you go in just take a few deep breaths and a drink of water. Remember that the dentist isn't there to hurt you, he is there to help you. Try not to panic just relax. Don't over react about anything it just makes matters worse. Please remember you'r not alone there are other people with this phobia. Take a friend along for support if you have to. All you have to do is follow these tips <br>  <br>  Stay calm, Take 5-10 deep breaths<br>  Take a bottol of water and take little sips of that.<br>  Take a friend along for support hold his/her hand and when you get nervouse just squeese it tightly.<br>  Remember nothing bad is going to happen<br>  Say out loud or in your head "Nothing bad is going to happen" repetedly or " everything is going to be O.K"<br>  you will be  fine.<br>  <br>  xx hope this works|`|84f4374bdc6d86131ec48ade47938d4faa	I have to go to the dentist for a filling tomorrow too.  I don't like it but I think of all the people in the world who are really sick and in tons of pain and think oh well, this is only for a few minutes and it will be over.  Dentists are used to nervous people and you won't be the worst patient he's had to deal with by a long way.  Don't take diazepam, you don't need it.  Try some Bach remedy if you feel you need a little bit of help - you can get it from Boots or the health shops.  You will be fine and you will have nice healthy teeth afterwards.  Best of luck!|`|G6t2O9Kmaa	Just shut your eyes and pretend you are somewhere else. Bring an MP3 player with some relaxation music on it.|`|AA10406285	Communicate your fears to your dentist ahead of time. Let him or her know the extent of your phobia. They should be able to offer some suggestions that will help you.

A slow increase in stages, starting with possibly showing you a picture of a dentist.<br>  2. After/with each stage a relaxation technique is bettered, and so slowly, as you are confronted in higher levels of your fear you equally master a technique to not let it bother you.<br>  <br>  Research it on the internet, ask a friend who knows or does psychology or if you're loaded actually get a therapist.<br>  <br>  All the best.<br>  <br>  Remember that our fears are what define us, but so are our teeth!<br>  <br>  Don't let it get to you, read this article of a young girl here in the UK who died as a result of a fear of dentists. When she was young the dentist cut her tongue by accident, and at a later date she had to have some teeth removed. This led to a fear not only of dentists but also of opening her mouth. She starved to death after the hospital therapist misdiagnosed her thinking she was not eating for attention.<br>  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornwall/7893485.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cornw...</a>|`|aY6EjDwjaa	don't cancel<br>  i used ot be real scared of the dentist too (though not quite as much as you)<br>  then i went for my first filling and it was great, the dentist gave me this painkilling gel (that tasted of bananas) for my gums and showed me how the drill worked (i was curious) and though it hurt a little bit while he was drilling it was short and sharp and after the filling was in (the fillings are weird, they taste like hospitals smell...) i was happy id gone, cause face it, nobody likes having holes int heir teeth!<br>  so basically the dentist is fine, now mine has a t.v in the ceiling so i want to go more so i can watch goldenballs XD lol<br>  dont be afraid of the dentist, they're for your health, and want to make you better, like doctors (they pretty much are doctors)<br>  BTW tell your dent. about the ceiling t.v thing, might help him out with customers and so on:D

UZJ7wVc8aa	You can eat whatever you want on a diet as long as it fits within your daily calorie allotment.<br>  <br>  If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn). <br>  <br>  Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.<br>  <br>  Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories.

It's a harsh reality but its true. Try joining a gym and eating fuit!<br>  <br>  Another good way if you are having a hard time, is to eat weight watchers brand food/sweets! They are low in calories but taste delish!:) You can buy weight watchers treats in Tesco or dunnes stores or any super market really!(i do appologize if you are from the US, as i dont think you have that brand over there!)  <br>  <br>  Try taking up a sport or something.:)<br>  <br>  You don't ned to loose alot of weight as you are not heavy!<br>  <br>  but if you want to loose a few pounds, there are my suggestions!<br>  <br>  Oh! and if you for example, you ate a biscuit and a chocolate bar and you want to work it off....DO NOT do sit ups straight after eating them!! ALWAYS do a cardio work out(e.g running, cycling) before a toning work out(sit ups).! otherwise you will just get muscle under fat!! which is not pretty!!<br>  <br>  If you want my mothers diet, just contact me and i can give you a time table list of what foods are in the diet :)<br>  <br>  Good luck my friend!<br>  <br>  xxxxxx|`|lFpQCpPAaa	Exercise! I try and do a bit extra for each treat I eat. So maybe a walk to cancel out some ice cream?

uKmNYqGgaa	I take generic Wellbutrin SR (150 mg) in the morning, and Lexapro (10 mg) with dinner, for depression and anxiety.  I've been taking that for over two years, and it's working very well for me.<br>   <br>  The Wellbutrin SR seems to help me to be more alert and active - and wanting to do things - while the Lexapro makes me more mellow, and it helps me sleep better, too.  They are relatively low doses of each medication, which keeps side effects at a minimum.  I really can't tell I'm taking any medication at all.<br>   <br>  The good side effects... you'll feel better - if you're suffering from depression.  It has really helped me a LOT!<br>   <br>  It takes a couple weeks to start working, and four to six weeks to build to it's "full effective" level.<br>   <br>  If you're thinking of taking Lexapro, and they want to put you on more than 10 mg, consider taking Wellbutrin SR instead of increasing the Lexapro.  That keeps the side effects of the Lexapro down (drowsiness and sexual).<br>   <br>  One more thing... I've found (by experimenting) that taking my Lexapro with dinner works the best for me - I sleep better at night, and I'm more awake the next day.

2TTAxrclaa	I am a black guy and I know this question is not directed to my group but I would like to drop my 2 cents on this matter. <br>  White men, dating or not dating black women goes far beyond a matter of simple preference. Given the long and turbulent race relations between caucasians and people of African descent there are a lot of social pressures that influence whether an individual would date someone from outside their race or ethnic group. I believe that while a person is growing up, their minds are slowly socialized to accept certain standards. This includes standards of beauty and what kind of intimate relationships are socially acceptable.<br>  <br>  The United States (and I am assuming you live in the US), is indeed a  very diverse nation. However, it is still very segregated. Although legally this ended in the 1960s, all the different ethnic groups, black, white, asian, middle eastern choose to self segregate themselves, for a myraid of reasons.<br>  <br>  As a result of this self segregation people grow up around people who are just like them. If we are to use white males as an example, they grow up in communities that are predominantly white and hence from a young age, they are socialized to feel attraction toward white females. This is because all their closet male friends, family and even complete strangers are hooked up or paired with white women. Thus, when they begin looking for a significant other they first turn to the white women group, because that is what they are used to. To try and date a woman from another ethnic group/ black woman would involve "too much work". White males would have to extend their social boundaries and meet African American women before they can even begin think about dating black women. Now, I am sure you understand that we humans simply prefer to do the thing that is most convenient to us. As a result to have to go through the work of expanding your social network/ horizons is just too much effort and so many white males simply look for what is most familiar and what is most common to them.<br>  <br>  Lastly, the media does not help in the least. African American women are constantly portrayed as aggressive, verbally abusive and arrogant.<br>  One of the respondents to this question said "Omarosa" gave African American women a bad rep. In some respects this is very true. There are very few black people in mainstream media as it is and then among the few a large number tend to be very loud and "ghetto."  These are qualities that I believe men in general do not find as attractive in women. <br>  <br>  Matters are made even worse when one considers that the media makes out African American patois to be a sign of ignorance and a lack of education. Again, because of these images that we as a society are bombarded with would make any man who is not part of the African American community and who does not understand or is not accustomed to how the women of that group behave may be put off. One example would be the male respondent to this question, who said that he would not mind dating black women so long as they were not ghetto. <br>  <br>  I hope this makes sense and is helpful, it is just my two cents on this matter. Please, note that I feel the same general concepts apply to all racial or ethnic groups. I simply addressed it to whites and blacks because that is what the question asked.<br>  <br>  I myself am an African and I only moved to the US very recently. I will tell you honestly, when I first came here, I was reluctant to interact with black women, simply because of the images I had been exposed to in my home country ever since birth.|`|4bWUiIVdaa	Because they're scared of us hahaha.

All the white guys on here who say they don't like black girls' cultures or their music preferences or whatever other stereotype, way to generalize! *note the sarcasm* Don't be stupid. Every person is different, it doesn't matter what color they are.Yes I'm black, but that doesn't mean I am required to listen to hip/hop or rap. I listen to rock and all kinds of stuff. Just because I'm black doesn't mean I'm required to act ghetto. As you can tell I speak very proper. And another thing. There is no "speaking white". You can't speak a race; that's extremely ignorant. I speak proper, that's the way I was raised. Doesn't make me any less black because, oh wow, my skin is still brown even though I don't speak ghetto, surprise surprise!! <br>  <br>  I can't stand white guys that automatically say no to a question like this. Have you met every single black girl in the world? You haven't. A black girl may have a flat butt, no curves, thin lips, blue eyes, and blond hair, doesn't make her any less of a black girl. So please don't say no you would never date a black girl because we don't listen to the same music or we are all ghetto and aggressive, and then turn around and say you're not racist. That makes you racist.<br>  <br>  I don't date skin colors. I date personalities and looks. I've dated a white guy for 6 years, I've dated a mexican guy, I've dated an asian guy. It doesn't matter. Don't judge people based on their skin color before you even get to know them or better yet, before you even meet them!<br>  <br>  Why can't everyone try to be color blind?

k9ojRx60aa	Check it out dude.  I get it, I really do.  I have lived my entire life with skinny weener.  I knew it was, not right, so I measured. 4.25.  Really?  I thought I was cursed.  I have been with quite a few women and no matter how well I pleased them, no matter the great orgasms I gave them, I was not happy.  I have tried the regular jelqing exercises and my penis just kept getting longer, not fatter, granted I started with a penis lenght of 6.5 and increased to around 7.5, length was not what I was going for.  Emabarassing as it might be, I become obsessed.  The answer I believe for you and me is the ballooning technique.  I have made gains, now I am right where you're at in girth.  Happier?  Yes.  Satisfied?  No.    Take amino acids.  Balloon. no pain no gain. if you are serious, you can make it happen. it is working for me slowly but surely.   But in the end, if you are right with yourself, that is what is attractive to girls, when you are confident and can use your mouth too. learn to please them well before you even penetrate and it won't fail you. don't mean to be crude but it is the truth|`|xN8B6334aa	vacuum. dear lord why are you worrying about it?|`|t89erxkVaa	First off, calm down.

Yyt8ZjU2aa	"But if the real you is not who you wanted then how do you cope?"<br>  <br>  That's a good question. You have to learn to accept yourself. Regardless of how much you "disapprove" of yourself, self-acceptance is the most important factor towards redemption. You cannot try to improve yourself until you have learned to fully accept yourself. (All your flaws, strengths, struggles, and fears included.)|`|7O3r2QuHaa	lol......u dont have to come to terms with not being your real self.  peoples personalities are determined mostly by their brain chemistries, along with environmental factors.  if you modify the chemistry in your brain, you can become a different person. take for example, an extremely shy individual, when given prozac, will over a couple months become an extremely talkative individual. (in many cases, but not all).  <br>  <br>  give someone an unselective MAOI medication, and the same thing will happen. give someone oxycontin or extasy, and they will become much more social than normal.|`|j5DoL2NHaa	I think I can see how the two are compatible, especially in your case. Self-acceptance can lead to confidence, but it doesn't need to. It also has to do with how you perceive others. I know some people with very low self-esteem who manage to not give a **** because they have a realistic view on other people; their worth and the threat they pose. Basically you should try to change how you view other people. I think its hard to not be shy myself, especially when I'm this tired and depressed. But I know that I'll bounce back someday, more vibrant than ever.|`|xefsno3qaa	This actually might not be "who you are" but issues you have developed branching from experiences you have had in your life.  Have you gone and talked to anyone about these issues to find out WHY you are like this?  (a professional of course)  Accepting who you are comes with accepting things you CANNOT change, like your height, sound of your voice, body type, and the general way you compose yourself.  Stuff like that.  Being shy and nervous are not necessarily your "personality"  Maybe the shyness, but not the nervousness.  I really think if you had someone to help you work through the why's, then you can work on the how's.  No matter how old you are, there is always room for self improvement.  Do you think a guy is an asshole, then he is destined to ALWAYS be an asshole?  Personalities change all the time, in fact, generally they change every seven years - along with your tastebuds, likes/dislikes, etc.  If you don't like your personality, fix it.  I am not saying there is ANYTHING wrong with you, because I am extremely shy too (in the beginning) and I dont think there is anything wrong with that.  But if you want to change, change.  Sometimes the "real" you is masked with a bunch of emotions/ideas/feelings that were created by your environment.  Fortunately, they can be molded, changed, worked on, etc.|`|il9Tdmchaa	First of all the real you is who you are now a product of all your past experiences. If you want to change you can because you have control over who and what you are. You can take small steps to start to be more outgoing. Start by just saying hi to a stranger in a store. No conversation required but you've made contact with another person outside your comfort zone. You can go on from there. There are relaxation techniques you can learn so you're not so nervous. I've been the same way and am slowly working on becoming the person that I want to be and not who I am at the moment. When I'm done I will be real the way I want and not faking it.
vNM21JZnaa	Not sure exactly on this issue. However any reddness and inflammation is indicative of a possible infection or trauma to an area.  It looks as if their may be an infection in the soft tissue, and that has the potential to become very serious in a diabetic patient if there is existing diabetic neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease.  I would get is evaluated by a podiatrist asap, until then keep it elevated as much as possible and clean.  Wrap it with a dry dressing, and possibly use a topical antibiotic ointment in case infection is present.  I wouldn't stress out over this, but definitely have it evaluated by a professional knowledgeable in dealing with patients with diabetes and feet problems. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|25a903128a710f9935672e9f69763d85aa	Could be almost anything?

il9Tdmchaa	Wanting a rhinoplasty  in itself isn't bad. What you need to get over before having the surgery is that you're going to be a different person after the surgery. Don't hold back. You need friends now and they aren't going to care one way or the other how you look.  You need some confidence now and realize that you're beautiful. After the surgery you probably will be more confident but do you really want to waste 2 years of lonlieness waiting? Don't hold back live life now and you can still look forward to the day you can have your surgery.|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	I think you need counseling more than you need plastic surgery, unless your nose is so large that it is disfiguring (and that is doubtful). I think you have been blaming a lot of your problems on your nose, and you will find that fixing your nose will not fix you, not one bit.  Since you are too young to get plastic surgery, consider counseling.  Some free computerized counseling you can get it at moodgym.anu.edu.au. They have a test you do that they use to identify "warpy thinking" that isn't quite right, and is causing you problems. Then you work on those thought patterns you have that are making you miserable.  <br>  <br>  I think it is really strange to not want to get close to someone because you are worried about your nose. That is very, very distorted thinking and I think you have serious issues. I'm enormously fat from taking bipolar medications, and I don't avoid meeting people because I'm fat and maybe I will slim down one day? I am sure your nose is way less noticeable than my weight.  There is something seriously wrong, and you need therapy. Based on what you have written here, I think it is unethical for a plastic surgeon to do work on you.  And then for you not to even want to go out because of your nose - this is seriously problematic.<br>  <br>  You have raised HUGE red flags here, the plastic surgery will not help you, you are in for a horrible life if you do not get professional help.  I really believe that.<br>  <br>  PS I am NOT anti-plastic surgery. I just think what you have written here is the kind of thing plastic surgeons look for when they DENY a patient surgery, because the patient is looking for surgery to cure mental problems.|`|ldpDzaolaa	No, because self image is important. you will be the same person, only other's will react to you differently, because we are so superficial. It will give you a new confidence and you will have to adjust to yourself, it takes a full year for complete healing,but you will see results right away, just some swelling and changes until it settles down. you won't regret it, just go to someone who gives excellent results, be realistic, it depends how natural you want it or, a bit upturned that will drop over time, (that's the best) cause our noses do drop over time as we get older, just not something that doesn't fit your face, a few millimeters makes alot of difference. Be comfortable with who you work with, the expensive and most popular aren't always the best, either.... fyi. don't get addicted with body dysmorphic image to have other unrealistic changes, our faces change with time. you just want improvement, not overall body image and dysfunctional changes.|`|TmYTjJT8aa	Plastic surgery is pretty expensive....<br>  <br>  Personally, I think that doing something like this to "feel like a new you" is more like "escape from the old you"<br>  <br>  But, there is nothing wrong with having high hopes. If you really want this, then go for it. But make sure that you really want this and promise yourself that you won't regret it once you get it.|`|T2o9ptUlaa	You have to realize that not everyone likes generic beauty.

But for people who are anxious, weed tends to make those people paranoid.<br>  <br>  Here are some natural ways to get rid of anxiety.  If nothing works, then maybe other medications perscribed by doctors can be used as your "crutch".

It can calm the nerves but it can also make you paranoid.  I would seek other solutions.  I tried smoking pot to make me feel better and it just made it so that I couldn't think very well.  I have social anxiety and I know that pot will not help that.  Alcohol would help but it's not a good solution either.  Stay away from drugs even if you have a sincere desire to be better.  They're illegal and self medicating is not the answer.  An anti anxiety medication may help.  I just cope by ignoring my fear.  Then I don't want to get out because I know it's going to be a battle against my fear.  Sometimes it does go away and it can get better.  It wouldn't hurt to pray.|`|xCCyGtv2aa	It is not advisable to use any drug that has not been prescribed for you by a medical professional.

There are numerous alternatives to drugs or alcohol.|`|bxYdZ0q4aa	It could go either way....sometimes weed causes some people to become paranoid which may make the anxiety worse or it could do the complete opposite and just chill you out....hard to tell....maybe try with close friends first or just dont do it.

nOFvdF9yaa	I don't know your age, that's a little problem. Moreover the test that showed 7.2 was fasting or random----you didn't mention! Well, to me, 7.2 is not high level. 5 to 6 is better. Crossing 7.5 is the symptom of real diabetes as a fasting sugar level. I don't know even what did you eat before that testing! You know, if a normal person drink a glass of sherbet full of sugar, his sugar level may show 8 or 10 even but for a short period. I'm a diabetic patient under medication & my doc told me (assured me) that even 9 would be all right. It's true that a normal person should carry a level of 4.5 to 5.5. Isn't it better to wait till Thursday? No panic please. Sometimes panic increases some diseases.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	the test the doctor did is called an A1C, or glycosylated hemoglobin, normal is under six, so at <br>  7.2 yours is indeed elevated and you do have diabetes.  you need to stop worrying tho, as that can affect your blood sugar too.  Ask  your doctor to refer you to a nutritionist that specializes in diabetes management, then you can learn what you need to know to live a long healthy life.<br>  In the meantime consume no refined sugars, eat fresh vegetables fruit and meat and limit bread products or anything made with grain.  You will do fine if you learn what you need to know from a nutritionist.|`|BhFeii5Xaa	I think your number is from the HbA1c blood draw? <br>  <br>  Normal numbers are from 4 to 6, so yes, 7.2 is a bit on the high side.

Yes, stress can make them higher.<br>  <br>  You will probably be given a choice to do weight loss, more exercise, and dietary restrictions or oral antidiabetes medications, more exercise and dietary restrictions.<br>  <br>  Fasting and HbA1c don't necessarily go together. A1c is an average of the percentage of glucose molecules clinging to red blood cells for the last 90 days. there is absolutely no way a meal just before blood draw will change that nor will fasting for days. It is for the other items they tested that they required the fasting. Such as the Lipids Panel.|`|6gmLk9jHaa	I have diabetes. I had about for three years now. Everyday I have to check my blood sugar. And I have to take a shot. I take a shot about 4 times a day. This is a special medicine for diabetics. This medicine is called insulin. I started taking insulin about a few months after I found out that I had diabetes. If your blood sugar is low than you have to have sugar to bring it up. You can eat swt things like regular soda, ice cream, and other things that have a lot of sugar. You have to drink diet soda and a lot of water. Because when your a diabetic you can be thirsty a lot.

It is highly likely that you do have diabetes. But don't worry! It just means that you would have to start being more careful about the foods you eat and make sure to exercise more. You would have to start making sure you exercise. It could mean you will need to take insulin depending which kind you have. It's ok! It's just different, and it does take a little time to get used to. Most of all, if you're worried, talk to people about it. When I found out I was diabetic, practically the first thing I did was log on to the American Diabetes Association website (first link) and find out what all this meant. After a little research and exploring, I found out they have chat rooms. Depending on your age, you can make up a screenname and password and start talking to people about it. This should help you get the answers you need and become more familiar and comfortable with it. Also, seeing as I'm a diabetic, if you want, you can talk directly to me on the chat. I'll be under "celestescribe". But don't hesitate to talk to other people, too! Good luck! The second link is a list of all the different chat rooms you can try.

There are tons on this site that come with a prescription, but there are a few that come in non-prescription only.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.coastalcontacts.com/halloween-lenses/cHalloweenLenses-p1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.coastalcontacts.com/halloween...</a>

Its like resettign the defualt settings before you go hacve fun. Also lubrication will help with some pain maby caused by the friction so good luck now!!|`|F6K4mNBUaa	You vagina will stretch in time. Perhaps when you feel pain try to stimulate your external parts so it distracts you from the pain. <br>  <br>  ***Also, make sure you guys use lots of lubrication for the time being. <br>  <br>  Sorry if I grossed anyone out.|`|vSv3wXweaa	use durex lube one of the ingredients will help this. other than that see your gyne, she can perscribe 'weights' or 'cups' that you wear all the time to help stretch you|`|1Jw5GCNOaa	Don't do it as fast|`|LdT97HWCaa	have a baby so your pussy stretches|`|IrsTJ51Qaa	how bout dont jam it all in yourself lol|`|MenTTJ8zaa	just tell him to go slow, your ******** will morph into the appropriate size and in a while itll all be good<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  answer  mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Am3IxMyythvdWVuaFppUPLTTxQt.;_ylv=3?qid=20090222100322AAVkR4W">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|vnlgWEzGaa	use vaseline ;)|`|0y6hw5c4aa	seems that your vaginal walls are still tight. ask him to go slower and if that doesnt work try new postions...it used to hurt when i got on top but we try other positions now and its fine. if that still doesnt work, you should try KY...your probably too dry down there..|`|uPUTjMxxaa	stop he must be  doin it to hard and he might be hitting rong parts ......... lol lmao sex is suppose to hurt !!!!! thats y u say ugbh ugh ugh lol|`|7abc8a12212468a52586c2c62d6edd72aa	SLOW down and enjoy,take it easier,talk to him.|`|HzjeKsDJaa	its an exit not an entrance

hHSsMyNpaa	Braces are a fair amount of trouble really so you will have to decide if you want to go through with it.  Ask the ortho what could happen in the distant future if you don't get them.  Don't just take the orthos word for it that you need them.  Have him explain to you exactly what and why. Orthos can find some reason for just about anyone to get braces.  If you get them and don't follow the program you could make yourself worse and end up having them for a long time, for several years or more.|`|DCe7GVJAaa	leave your teeth alone.they look good.if your that selfconsious worry about  it later.|`|4fLxvOHhaa	Your teeth look fine, if you're self conscious about them then get it done you will regret it later on.

A side effect of bulimia is low potassium AND electrolyte imbalances, so that's very plausible, but a racing heart is not usually related to either of those things. You should go to the hospital just to make sure, even if it means finding out about your purging. xx|`|sF13O9Fmaa	Please get help, remember your heart is a muscle and when you don't get enough calories your body burns muscle as well as fat, you will eventually if not all ready be wasting away your heart which will result in a heart attack.

f1bLjTrVaa	i know exactly how you feel same thing is going on with me. It is most likely bevause of the cold weather its called the winter blues. this happens to me every year and the second it turns warm everything changes and i get happier. just wait it off im sure you will be fine and trust me your not alone it happens to alot of people like my friends its happened to too and we usally just sit around not wanting to do anything.|`|AA11967904	Go and see a doctor your starting to go in to depression and the lack of enjoyment in things that you use to have fun with is a serious sign of depression and will only get worse.|`|xVJdgoIyaa	frikenphone is right. its winter blues. things may or may not get better on there own. but to be safe, you should talk to your doctor. it might help to research winter blues/depression.<br>  <br>  hope you feel better.|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	Has anything significant changed in your life? For example, did someone die, a parent lose a job, or were you in sports or some other extracurricular in the fall, and now that's all done, so you don't get as much social support?  did a best friend move away? If things like these have happened, it is normal to feel bad, and those bad feelings are telling you that you need to do something to make your situation better.<br>  <br>  If nothing much has happened, it sounds like you are coming down with a mood disorder. Some of us just have something wrong with our brains, and we get this problem. In other cases, a person may have been emotionally or sexually abused, and the person starts getting more problems as they go thru the teenage years. Teenage and 20's are when most people come down with mood disorders. Especially suspect this if others in your family have mood disorders - they can be very genetic.  I suggest you talk to your mom or dad about this, and if the symptoms are causing quite a lot of suffering, ask for them to arrange for professional help for you. A therapist may do the trick, but it isn't enough for everyone, some people need meds.<br>  <br>  In the meanwhile, make sure you get as much social support as you can - hang out with friends a lot. Make sure you don't listen to sad music - sad music can really make moods a lot worse. Make sure you get a lot of exercise - that is a proven help (and often hard to do in winter).  If your thoughts are painful and going on awhile, distract yourself by reading a novel, watching a movie, playing a videogame, playing cards, etc.<br>  <br>  Do make a point of talking to your mom or dad about this - they need to know, and they have probably gone thru similar experiences in their lives & may have some good advice.  This way they will be ready to help if you get worse, too.
WEM5n41Oaa	Just go up to her and talk to her.  Introduce yourself.  You could try to sit by her in class.  I wouldn't try to hang out with her right away.  If you could sit next to her you might become friends and then later get to know one another outside of class.  I know that I am attracted to people like that.  I want to console them and understand what's going on in their lives.|`|Y0DugutZaa	hey, dont try to push things, maybe just say hi a few times and then try to chat after a while, she probably wouldnt mind someone paying her attention and being nice to her.  (she sounds like me 2 years ago and i would have really appreciated someone just saying hi now and again) so all i can say is good luck and thank you for caring about those around you.
AA10213842	anyway hcv infectious blood enters your bloodstream. this includes sharing drugs (straws and dollar bills as well as needles). toothbrushes, razors, blood recipient, mass innoculations, skin grafts.<br>  just going to the nail salon can result in hcv infection...these are just a few ways to get it.<br>  <br>  hcv is NOT a true std because of the lack of blood under normal sexual intercourse. again, i could bleed and provided the recipient didn't have an open wound, hcv infection would not take place.<br>  <br>  just remember: blood to blood only.<br>  <br>  good luck!

It takes time for your body to digest food. I also don't get why you want to keep eating, but I guess that's none of my business. Give it time to digest and you'll be hungry. You don't even have to think about it; it does it for you ;)|`|uZQ9GDSlaa	Maybe you would be better off eating 5 or 6 smaller meals a day, instead of huge meals that make you so full.|`|mKBveDhHaa	eat gum like no joke. wenever i eat gum (actulaly im eating it now) and im hungry lol
BLD9EEWNaa	Wow- I'm really glad you asked that because I've been having serious problems with that myself (paranoid schizophrenic).  It was okay, just seeing strange things that I assumed weren't really until I saw some construction workers working on a roof, and for some reason pointed them out, and no one else saw them.  That's what really freaked me out- if I imagined something so normal, then what else have I seen that isn't?  I mean, the dead children and the demons and golems and miniature animals I can figure out fine, but the people sitting on park benches and the construction workers???  If you find out how, please let me know.|`|29e999153715416dcc6bab042f16f0c4aa	As a schizoaffective I often have to ask other people what is real or not and sometimes I look like a fool doing it, but it's necessary either way. I too see visual disturbances. Those are easy because I can mostly tell that flashes of light or wavy patterns aren't real. When I see people out of the corner of my eye then that makes it a little harder. I also hear things too. Hearing things is an even harder reality to separate. This is the one where I have to ask roomates if they heard anything. More often than not they don't hear what I'm hearing. I usually find it difficult to tell what is a real voice and what is a fake one. I'm pretty new to this so I still have a hard time distinguishing certain sights and sounds. <br>  <br>  When the conversation is weird it's usually the other person. If the person starts giving you funny looks then it's you. I've experienced both. I guess I'm not the best person to answer considering my experience with this stuff, but I hope I have helped somewhat.|`|Ep7fwAtFaa	For me when I think I am seeing/hearing something if I am around someone I know I ask them if they do also. If I am not around I know I simply ask myself is that at all possible. Usually when I start to see/hear something I try to get into the doc. or another professional and talk about it.|`|NPWc3Ej7aa	As a schizophrenic, I ignore anything or anyone that seems stranger than usual. If it persists, I ask someone near me if they understand what is happening. If they say they do, then I figure its real. If they give me a questioning look, I continue to ignore it.
e0KPhvqCaa	Your 12. Chill out. You have plenty of time. Everyone is different and just because one article says you should be here and not there doesn't make it so. Do yourself a favor and let nature take its course.|`|0y6hw5c4aa	they usually start growing after you hit puberty (like after your period starts) and it also reflects on your ancestors. ask your mom and grandmom when theirs starting growing.<br>  <br>  i was 9 when my boobs starting growing, but my period didnt start till i was 11, and the women on both sides of my family have big boobs, and so do i, (im 42dd) and they are still seeming to be growing, also eating a lot could influence then to grow. but its not great having big boobs i have back problems like a motha f*#@a and i cant stand for long periods of time<br>  <br>  but good luck|`|xiFNmvOvaa	Your just growing, and you might just be a late bloomer which isnt bad also. I know i didnt start really developing till middle of 8th grade. You will grow no matter what it just sometimes takes longer.|`|9uZAluGhaa	it's growing, the breast bud gets puffy then flat then puffy again, that means its growing.
wTkvkWscaa	Aw, man, my freshman year of high school I was the same way. I had NO friends, and gym was just awful. I had it third period, so all through second period I felt like I was going to puke. I finally started talking to some kids in the class, and making some friends, and it got better.<br>  <br>  So that's my suggestion. It might be scary at first, but try to put yourself out there a bit. If you made some friends in the class, you would probably feel less nervous.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|epQrN1v1aa	same wit me! its your first day you say? it is normal the other kids just wont admit it|`|nigSXGtyaa	This is normal for many middle school kids.  The transition from elementary to middle school can be very tough on kids.  I was like this even when i was in 8th grade on sunday i would be nervous.  The thing that helped me was thinking of the fun things that you would get to do in school the next day and thinking of the time you would get to spend with your friends the next day and eventually you will feel better and better about going to schoo.
lQ8p2QKkaa	You should begin with 35 pushups and add 2 per day(so in a few weeks time.. There will be a hell a lot of pushups..

I have had sex multiple times and it continues to hurt at the beginning. Just like you, after the initial penal entrance, it is wonderful. So all I can tell you is to maybe use a lubricant or lubed condoms to make entrance easier.<br>  I hope this helps!|`|uzIiaT4oaa	Foreplay and lubrication.|`|4adEwhkZaa	That means your body is not ready yet. I think you need to do it by yourself and find your weakness and and strengths. Yes, masturbating. Masturbating is not a bad thing and doesn't affect anyone negativley. For you, you will be able to know what feels good and not. Just play with yourself and you will learn a lot from it, trust me! By the time you know what your body wants, your sex will be much better.

8Xbc4ok1aa	Weight-bearing exercise and impact loading stimulate bone growth. Generally, three 20 to 30 minute sessions a week are sufficient. If you can and want to do more, go for it! Activities such as walking, running, aerobics or climbing stairs are also excellent forms of exercise to aid in bone growth. <br>  <br>  You should incorporate calcium rich foods into your diet as much as possible. Dairy products and calcium-fortified foods as mentioned earlier are great choices. Try to get between 1,000 and 1,500 milligrams a day. <br>  <br>  Do not shy away from dairy products because of the fat content. We now can purchase just about any dairy product available in a low/non-fat version. Milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, cheese all come in low-fat or non-fat varieties. <br>  <br>  Consider vitamin K. This vitamin switches on a bone-building protein called osteocalcin. Experts say 100 micrograms (mcg) a day may be best for bones. Food sources include spinach, Brussels sprouts, roccoli, asparagus, cabbage, coleslaw and collard greens. <br>  <br>  Stop smoking. Smoking increases your risk because it accelerates the metabolism of estrogen, making less available to stimulate bone growth. <br>  <br>  Eat cereals fortified with vitamin D. For your body to absorb and deposit the calcium you get from food, you need vitamin D. <br>  <br>  The supplement option. There is always the supplement choice! <a href="http://www.sato-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.sato-growth.com</a> and <a href="http://www.bestsato.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bestsato.com</a> l have tried this and it works. ( for adults l suggest 8 month or pro versions)<br>  <br>  Set a time to take that supplement! Plan to take your product at a specific time each day to make taking it a habit. <br>  <br>  Make it magnesium. This mineral actually makes up part of your bone. Your daily goal should be 400 milligrams. Good food sources include nuts, dried beans, crabmeat, spinach, wheat germ, wheat bran and chocolate - yes, chocolate! <br>  <br>  Fortify with calcium. If you do not enjoy foods high in calcium or suffer from lactose intolerance, look for foods fortified with calcium. Cranberry juice and breakfast bars are good choices.|`|j7rBM2yTaa	See Emma's story in the link below.<br>  <br>  A bit drastic!|`|S5ZYHiFaaa	you should try strapping some weights to your shoes, then dangle yourself a couple feet off the floor by your wrists. do this for about an hour a day, two days out of the week, and your joints will stretch out and make you at least a few inches taller.

5d0506fe6f86fded69f53c9e28c5f779aa	You will want to contact MassHealth directly to discuss if and how much they will cover for Invisalign. I do believe Invisalign accepts MassHealth, but for the actual amount covered is not something Invisalign could tell you (at least not without them calling MassHealth with your information). You'd have to call MassHealth to discuss what coverage you have and how much you'd be covered for orthodontics such as Invisalign if you have orthodontic coverage.<br>  <br>  MassHealth Customer Service Center<br>  1-800-841-2900<br>  <br>  I was just fitted for Invisalign and have already had a disappointment to do with my insurance coverage. You can read about it at <a href="http://my-invisalign.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://my-invisalign.blogspot.com/</a><br>  I detail not only my insurance issue but other topics and questions I've had answered along the way.|`|W9231Egtaa	can't answer the insurance question, but in response to the above poster, you may not need your teeth filed and spaced as described.  i didn't.  and even if you do, it's not as terrible as this person makes it sound.|`|AA11864514	I currently have Invisalign!, so I may be able to help!<br>  With a Hotel Trades Insurance, Invisalign costs up to 4,000. Take my own dental work, it cost 4,200.<br>  It's pricey but definitely invisible. <br>  <br>  Some things I should mention- as a head's up- are that you better rinse after you eat (EVERY TIME), You may not know but even after you take a swig of water, food still remains caked in your molars. With Invisalign, it eventually makes it's way to the front of your teeth, showing the world the wonderful remnant's of your lunch.<br>  <br>  Another thing, when you begin the dentist will shape your teeth with thin keys and inches of metal mesh. They'll stick the key between two teeth that need work and then work the mesh between then. On bad ones you will be in pain and bleed and will definitely want to claw the eyes out of your dentist. They will not be gentle. I wasn't bad enough I wanted to cry but very uncomfortable, make sure they have good, strong, armrests before using them as pain transfers.
Fzvfa6bxaa	OK, <br>  <br>  there is nothing that you can do at home to help an umbilical hernia.  In puppies, small ones may close on their own and never cause any trouble.  <br>  <br>  Larger ones can get fat or a loop of intestine caught inside it.  If it does, and then starts to close off "strangulate"  the blood supply will be compromised.  This makes it an emergency for your pet, and will be VERY painful.  <br>  <br>  I definitely suggest that it be repaired surgically either ASAP or whenever you have her spayed if you haven't already.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!
13k2WKx8aa	Spray the toilet and sink knobs with lysol.<br>  <br>  Keep a clean house.<br>  <br>  Do laundry instead of leaving it in a pile on the floor (someday I'm actually going to do this on a regular basis).<br>  <br>  Good hygiene practices. Shower when you wake up and before you go to bed.<br>  <br>  Most importantly, don't rub your eyes. Most of the diseases you're going to contract in your lifetimes are going to come in one of two ways. Through breathing, and through rubbing your eyes. Yes, you can contract things from your eyes.<br>  <br>  Also, and this is another big one, exercise regularly. Keeping a healthy body will give you a damn near impervious immune system.|`|bIj65VE9aa	Don't share drinking glasses or food.

Oxycocine is incredibly addictive and causes paranoid delussions and nerve activation which makes the user feel surges of pain throughout the body, as well it cou causes depression following the high and that i why people on it end up commiting suicide. Weed is one of the leading causes of peranoid schitzoprenia. It is also highly addictive and dangerous, esp. because it usually has high levels of growing agents and fertilizer, highly toxic bug sprays etc. This kid is not loving or accepting himself. otherwise he would be taking care of himself rather than persuiting addicitive risk behaviour. I would phone the police using the anonymus line {Crime stoppers} if you care at all about him. This is illegal and harmful, he can kill himself and others and should be thrown in jail. Your sister has made a very poor choice and has probably been using herself, espcially if she allows him weed.

fk9AvB25aa	It could be chaffing, an allergic or some kind of reaction to some product he used, in grown hairs, ordinary pimples, boils, or pearly papules. <br>  Genital herpes usually looks like raised blisters or open cut like sores. The blisters can either appear in clusters or as a single raised blister with a ring around it. The first out break is usually the worst but that doesn't mean that it's usually the biggest. Your friend may also experience some itching, burning or tingling where the pimple is. He may also have swollen genitals, burning and or trouble peeing. If the out break was even worse then he might have flu like symptoms.<br>  A better way to tell would be if he went to the doctor and had the pimply thing tested for herpes.|`|AA11846603	Herpes are painful blistery sores.  I would tell your friend to get an STD test ASAP...you dont want him spreading that **** around!|`|qj1RLVEuaa	it could be blister from rubbing that area of the skin alot. if its only one its probably not herpes cause herpes spreads all over the genital area.

xmibEEdcaa	Migraines are usually around the eye and temple, and only on one side of your head.  What you have sounds to me more like a tension headache -- which isn't to say it doesn't hurt!  Tension headaches can be very painful, and yes, the pain can make you feel sick and sensitive to light and noise.  It could be a side-effect of your allergy, or it could be that you pulled a muscle somewhere in your neck.  Sometimes tension headaches just happen.<br>  <br>  Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, etc.) is usually best for me for tension headaches, because it has mild muscle relaxant properties. Take some ibuprofen and lie down in a quiet, cool, dark room.  If your neck and shoulders are stiff or hurting, try putting something cold on them for a while.<br>  <br>  If it doesn't get better by the end of the day, or if you start having these headaches frequently, then you should see a doctor.  With luck, though, it will go away in a few hours and not become a recurring thing.|`|CoiOMTiBaa	It could be either. It could also be a sinus headache to go along with your allergies. You should probably try something more like suddafed or benadryl. If you've never had trouble before, chances are your problems are not migraine related. Everyone does not have migraine; migraine is a neurological disorder. There is a common misconception that a bad headache, where one might be nauseous and sensitive to light, is a migraine attack. This is simply not the case. Even in the event that you are having a migraine of sorts, you should still consider Benadryl. Even in the emergency room, liquid, intravenous Benadryl is given as part of a cocktail with steriodal anti-inflammatories in order to help to calm a migraine attack down. There is nothing one can take over the counter to stop or "fix" a migraine attack and very little that a doctor can give you. Pain killers are inadequate and inefficient for fixing migraine attacks. The best things for you would be an allergy/sinus medication or IBU, which is an NSAID. See your primary care physician if things don't improve.

UZJ7wVc8aa	If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn). <br>  <br>  Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.<br>  <br>  Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories. You can find some more information at the Beginner's Guide to Dieting - <a href="http://straightdiet.com" rel="nofollow">http://straightdiet.com</a>|`|eRw2MYhgaa	I lost 10lbs so far from that special K challenge.<br>  It really isn't that hard and is tasty!<br>  <br>  I care a lot about my weight and I exercise on a regular basis.<br>  So if your already exercising then you should try the special K challenge.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Hon, this is not like when your friend gets a new cell phone and you wish you had one too.  You want it because it is a step toward being a grown woman and all of your friends are talking about this period thing and you don't fit in.  Not unusual to want to be like your friends and do the things that they do.  But this is different than anything else your friends have and you don't.  Each girl's body develops hormones at a different level.  Maybe your friends are taller or weigh more and that is why they have developed their hormones before you.  If you have pubic and underarm hair for over a year and have discharge, you may be close, but girls start anywhere from 9 to 17 years old and all are normal.  If your friends had cancer and were talking about it, would you want that too? <br>  <br>  You might be careful what you wish for.  Once you start, for the next 40 years you will have 3-10 days out of every month that you bleed from your vagina.  You have to deal with pads and sometimes smell.  You have to run to the bathroom at school and check between classes to make sure you haven't bled on your clothes.  What you should really be doing right now is doing the happy dance because you don't have periods yet.  Once they come, they aren't like the cell phone, you can't just wish they would go away and get rid of them.  <br>  <br>  So be happy for now and know that if you are female, you will not escape having periods.<br>  <br>  best wishes..|`|QJHE3z1raa	1. you dont want it; you say you do but you dont<br>  2.

2QuGuphYaa	Just ice it.  I highly doubt you broke anything.  The swelling and pain would be much greater if anything was broken.<br>  <br>  Ice on for about 20-30 minutes tops every couple hours.  Also, keep the leg elevated as lowering the amount of blood that enters that area will reduce the swelling.  If you happen to have an ace bandage then wrapping it up will also help.  <br>  <br>  Another thing that will help reduce swelling is taking an anti-inflammatory such as Motrin IB.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I would suggest delaying making any unnecessary trips to the ER for this as the original poster suggested.

39e46128b8ea5a82c45af42790e8132daa	Masturbation is sexually pleasing yourself. So if you've ever touched yourself in a sexual manner, you've masturbated. "Masturbation refers to sexual stimulation, especially of one's own genitals (self masturbation), often to the point of orgasm."  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masturbation" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masturbatio...</a><br>  <br>  The hymen is a very thin piece of skin partially or fully covering the vaginal opening. Most women are born with one, but since they are so fragile, many women don't make it to their first sexual encounter with an intact hymen. Things like tampon use, masturbation, horseback riding, vigorous exercise, etc., can break a hymen. Many cultures look to see if there is a hymen intact on a women to determine virginity, however, this tactic is flawed as the hymen can be torn through other various activities that are not related to sex. Just keep in mind that having a hymen doesn't necessarily mean that you're a virgin, and not having one doesn't mean that you've had sex. <br>  <br>  Virginity refers to whether a person has had sexual intercourse or not. A woman whose vagina has never been penetrated by a penis is still a virgin. A man whose penis has never penetrated a vagina is still a virgin.

iLrp65oXaa	There are so many problems with this I don't know where to start.<br>  <br>  1. Don't take diet pills.  They don't work and can cause serious health problems.<br>  <br>  2. Don't drink energy drinks.  The high caffeine levels can produce similar symptoms to those you described.<br>  <br>  3. Don't take the above together.  They are both (usually) diuretics and if you are exercising can make you very dehydrated if you aren't drinking lots of plain water.<br>  <br>  4. You exercised for 3 and a half hours.  Is this more than normal for you?  If so it could make you feel light headed and dizzy.<br>  <br>  Try drinking lots of water to rehydrate yourself.  When you go to the bathroom and your urine is any darker than clear yellow it means you are dehydrated.  Eat something with protein in it.  If you still feel like that call your doctor.  And from now on don't put that crap in your body.|`|Afm3iyfbaa	well u just did the stupidest thing you could do to your  body. your heart is beating fast cause all the suger u had, then u played ddr and your heart raced even faster, thats also why your getting dizzy. dont sweat it though just sit down and drink a glass of water. if u keep feeling like that go the docters. if u have any oter health or fitness questions email me.|`|AA10605011	It's not advisable to take 2 diet pills and also an energy drink together. There is a huge probability that  the diet pills you took contain enough caffeine and your energy drink definitely has caffeine. This makes your heart race faster and when the effect wears out you feel exhausted. <br>  <br>  My advice is do not take 2 diet pills in the first place and do not take energy drinks with your diet pills. Be careful next time as too much caffeine is not good for ones health.

teXYeBxBaa	I assume you are firing this person for reasons other than NPD. Based on what you said, you are afraid of his reaction to your termination. First of all, make sure someone is in the room with you so that you have a witness in the event this winds up in litigation.  Don't do this by yourself. You may be surprised at his reaction. Narcissist are very concerned about appearances, since they think they are the greatest thing since sliced bread. Don't be surprised if he quietly retreats, exits the building to never be heard from again. It is important for him to appear to always be in control.  Narcissist ALWAYS believe they are better than everyone else. By losing his temper and causing a ruckus, he won't be able to consider himself better than than ones firing him,. He will not want to lose his ability to play the victim, you can bank on that.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|angW1Lkfaa	You going to fire someone because they are in love with themselves?

AA10135767	I've had this before. It's a bacterial infection - greenish tint and fishy odor.  Don't be embarrassed.  It's a normal thing that can happen.  And it has absolutely nothing to do with any kind of STD.  Mine came after I'd had surgery a few weeks prior and was taking antibiotics for a while.  It was clearing out of my system and this resulted.  But it can occur just like a simple cold can occur.  You will need to see your doctor for treatment.  It's weird but I was given antibiotics and was told that a yeast infection could occur in response.  I never got the yeast infection fortunately, but it's crazy how women's bodies work.  Take care sweetie.|`|Ghu73ELNaa	Sounds like a yeast infection. Go to the doctors and they will prescribe you with antibiotics to clear it up.

But when I started getting arthritis, everyday life became difficult. The more I walked the worse it [the arthritis pain] got, the pain was like a knife twisting inside. Sometimes my hip would give out, it just wouldn't support me. Then there was the sharp pain. Before surgery, the pain was absolutely debilitating. I was getting totally disabled. I couldn't walk. I couldn't stand. That's when I decided that I needed to do something. Once at church I met an very old friend of mine who suffered from the same pain as mine and that’s when she recommended me Fly2india4health Consultants in India , my first thought about surgery in India was fear. I researched on my condition and my possible treatment options. I also spoke with the associate orthopedic surgeon with Fly2india4health Consultants who gave me educational material to help set my expectations after surgery. I was also been told that I would be up the same day as surgery and I was. The most important thing after the surgery is exercise. After surgery, I didn't have to take a lot of pain medication - maybe for 2 or 3 days. I attribute that to the skill of my surgeon. I was driving two weeks after surgery, Had I known it was going to be this easy, I would have had it done much earlier. If u need any orthopaedic care I will certainly advice you to go to Fly2india4health Consultants!<br>  <br>  Source:<br>  <a href="http://www.fly2india4health.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.fly2india4health.com</a>
AA10451841	The pulse you feel is your aorta -- the main artery coming from your heart and conveying blood to your body. Your main pipeline. Thin people can sometimes appreciate pulsations from the aorta. Other times, it can be a sign that the aorta is enlarged -- an abdominal aortic aneurysm, or AAA, which can be dangerous. A doctor can examine you and order imaging tests like ultrasound or CT scan if necessary.|`|dfJ8yM4Qaa	Better than no pulse right ?|`|AA11846603	Most everyone has a pulse in their abdomen.

But if your parents had poor diet, or had an illness when they were growing, that could have stopped them from reaching their maximum height potential.<br>  Milk is a healthy thing to drink, but too much can actually limit your growth! 2 glasses a day is recommended. If you are eating healthy food each day then you don't need vitamin supplements, but if your meals are not very healthy either try to change them or to get vitamins.<br>  Keeping fit may help you to grow. I don't know of proof either way. But some stretches do improve your posture, and that makes you look an inch or so taller.<br>  If your height is a big issue for you then I do have loads of tips on how to make yourself look taller than you are.

I said, "I don't know what to do. How can I make you feel as good as you make me feel?" His answer was simple and made perfect sense:<br>  "Do to me what I do to you."<br>  <br>  So I did. Whatever he did to me I did back at him. It was fun, and together we learned how to please each other, and what things one of us might like that the other did not, and vice versa.<br>  <br>  One evening, BEFORE you actually get between the sheets, have a talk with your girlfriend. <br>  Say something like this:<br>  "Honey, I really want to please you and I know you want to please me,  too. Tell me what you like best."<br>  Listen to her. THEN, after REALLY LISTENING, say to her, "I'd like to tell you what I like, too."<br>  Then tell her what you like to have done to you.<br>  Then kiss her and say, "Let's go try those things."<br>  Everyone wants to not only feel loved and wanted, but to feel that they are pleasing their partner.<br>  <br>  Since you are BOTH new to sex, you might also get a sex manual like "The Joy of Sex" and read it TOGETHER.

jnuBYMAiaa	Testicular Congestion, better known as "Blue Balls" is the retrograding of semen back into the testicles. This usually happens when the male is beginning to orgasm or is the middle of one when all stimulation of the body stops, causing the semen to not be ejected, going back into the testicles. This makes the testicles real sensitive, uncomfortable and engorged until the male is able to ejaculate the built up semen. You can do more research on this online or at a library. Hope this helps.|`|AA10667393	You could look it up.<br>  Most common: sore testicles due to sexual stimulation not resolved by orgasm.<br>  <br>  Second, rare: blood leaking into testicles from burst blood vessel in penis.|`|pGSfFI6aaa	Its when your testicles hurt and are very sensitive when you are having sex but not ejaculating.

I stopped drinking soda (I'll still have some every now and then but for the most part i've replaced it with water), when I crave chips, or any other kind of junk food I don't deprave myself I get it but just eat a lil until my craving is appeased then give the rest away or throw it away to not have the temptation around. <br>  <br>  I also started reading this book : You on a diet by: micheal f roizen, m.d and mehmet c. oz. m.d. that teaches you how to lose weight without having to stay away from your favorite things. <br>  <br>  Also just start walking a lil more than you already do I know it doesn't seem like much but trust me it helps I've already lost weight.

A lot of pills make you gain weight all over, not just in one area.  Don't just take b.c. for increased breast size because it can also have side effects such as weight gain, hair loss, mood swings, risk of stroke, weak bones, etc.--all depending on what type and depending on the person.  If you think you might need it for a good reason, then talk to your doctor and mother about it.|`|IA5SuFkdaa	well even if it makes other people's boobs bigger it's always gonna have some side effects, and i would say they're not worth it just for having an inch of bigger boobs.|`|v92aRylQaa	I suppose it could, but it could also make you gain weight - therefore bigger breasts. Wait until you're 21 when you've stopped growing. I was an A cup and went to a C cup overnight.

The larger the dosage of hormones will more than likely increase your breast size – but you should consult with your doctor. <br>  <br>  The use of birth control to increase your breast size is also convenient and easy to use. You simply take the pill and let it work its magic.<br>  <br>  Well, there is some bad news here. The possible side effects of using birth control are weight gain, fluid retention, mid-cycle spotting, headaches, mood changes and nausea. Another con is that when your partner finds out you are using birth control (especially if you are single and sexually active) they may not be so accommodating when it comes to wearing a condom.<br>  <br>  What could be the biggest disappointment is that when you finally stop using the pill all of the desired effects usually disappear. There could also be some long term effects from using birth control that you should discuss with your doctor.<br>  <br>  In the end it’s really up to you. Many find that the half cup to one cup results of using birth control to increase breast size is not worth the many side effects. Other breast enlargement alternatives such as herbal breast enhancement pills help to regualte your hormones and increase breast size naturall|`|Nc7clhzIaa	No.  That is a myth.  Only take bc pills if you are having irregular periods/preventing pregnancy.  You are only destroying your body more by taking something that is not regulating anything in your body.  The only trick to bigger boobs are implants & push-up bras.  You still have time to grow too.  I started taking them at 17 & never noticed a difference in breast size.|`|Eec9JeXbaa	not necessarily. Mine never got bigger from taking the pill. I think it is just a myth that ppl want to believe. It changes the hormone balance in your body, so they might appear fuller, but not noticeably. <br>  I wouldn't go on the pill if you're not ready to have sex, those pills are not good for you to take if you don't need them. <br>  <br>  being on the pill for many years can stop your periods and mess up your system, so don't go on it until you're ready.|`|70pknKHraa	NO. No. and No. <br>  <br>  First of all, don't take any drug of any kind unless there is a medical reason. Drugs have all kinds of known and unknown side effects. <br>  <br>  Second, respect yourself. You have to live with your body the rest of your life. Believe me,  one of the most popular medical procedures in 2008 was "breast reduction (spelled  R E D U C T I O N) surgery" - Many women are seeking to reduce the size of their breasts.<br>  <br>  Take heart and enjoy being a 16 year-old Respect yourself. Love yourself, and do something special for yourself. Don't take anything just to "make your boobs bigger." Promise me you'll listen.<br>  <br>  Good luck for a full, happy life.|`|B2rZ98rhaa	No.  Do not take any medication that you don't have to-it has many side effects.  There are a lot of growth hormones in the food we eat, so that may make you larger just from eating.  Please wait to have sex, it complicates your life in so many ways.  Take care of yourself.|`|RVlkauBRaa	Well im on birth control because of my periods, and because im sexually active. But I will admit my boobs did get bigger since ive been on it :s<br>  <br>  They were like a b, now there a d.<br>  But maybe that was just me growing :p idk.|`|2CYfjPA6aa	Lol. The only thing it does is make you gain weight like crazy. Yeah sure your boobs might get bigger but so will your butt.. I seriously would   not take birth control in hopes of getting big boobs. You'll just gain a ton of weight.|`|UL1I46ylaa	my friend is on birth control (the shot) and yes, she did get bigger boobs but she also gained about 40-60 pounds.<br>  Not the best idea, condoms work better.<br>  Or those little boob exercises xD|`|kJhZw0HYaa	I don't think you should just to have bigger boobs. I your not going to have sex don't take birth control. I am sure you boobs are big enough.|`|X3QBqLSHaa	No, don't try them.|`|TUVI7FLlaa	wait you still have time to grow when you are 22 still no hope for your boobs then take|`|LBg4DNpCaa	It makes you gain all over. If you need to take them do it|`|CDb0SlJQaa	no|`|yVepdTi1aa	yeah it makes u fatter which makes ur boobs bigger|`|9mafrWGvaa	Birth control pills are a hormone regimen, so for many women it does make their boobs bigger. This can happen for the same reason that you developed boobs in the first place (new hormones being produced by your body during puberty). <br>  <br>  Growing boobs is probably not the best reason to start taking the pill, but there are benefits. It regulates your period cycle so you can plan much easier. Studies have also shown that women who have taken the pill for more than 5 years have a lower chance of gynecological cancers. Then of course if you do have sex you will have pregnancy protection without having to wait for you to go on the pill.<br>  <br>  Also know however that the pill only helps prevent you from getting pregnant. It is not any sort of protection from STDs.|`|hzWtMS3zaa	No, and that is a bad idea.<br>  <br>  Taking birth control just to try to make your breasts bigger is somewhat naive. Don't bother trying it. You should only use birth control if you are having sex and don't want to have a child. Or if you are using it for your period. The best thing to do to get big boobs though, is the wonderful waterbra!<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|e25c06f563f6c8856bff52c0a4ce928faa	Yes they can. But i woudlent take them for no reason. Everything has side affects. You should look into them first and way out the pros and cons. I know some but im not 100 percent since i heard them from another girl|`|1y19FVukaa	they will stimulate ur hormones which makes ur boobs grow however, they are really bad and they are cancerous|`|vM4mR94waa	no because it does not make your boos bigger|`|83vlkzuWaa	uhhh no   notin makes them bigger then sugery or groth duhh ur a gurl right u should knowwww

6k5fhFyBaa	MSG has various detrimental effects, which include triggering asthma attacks and exacerbating migraine headaches. Studies have shown that oral ingestion of MSG can provoke asthma attacks in patients diagnosed with asthma, and bring about symptoms of the Chinese Restaurant Syndrome (CRS). The CRS is a collection of symptoms that include sweating, headache, flushing, and in more serious cases, swelling of the throat and chest pain. Although it was believed that MSG is the cause of CRS, no empirical studies have found a causal link between them. There have been studies showing MSG to exacerbate migraine headaches as well. Excess glutamate, acting as an excitatory neurotransmitter, causes over stimulation in the brain prolonging the migraine attacks. In more serious cases, MSG may even cause neuronal death due to over stimulation.<br>  <br>  Not only is MSG found to induce asthma and migraine attacks, but is also linked to diseases such as obesity, Type 2 diabetes and Alzheimer’s disease. Metabolizing glutamate after a MSG-rich meal induces the release of glucose into the blood stream. This in turn triggers the secretion of insulin by the pancreatic islet cells, so that muscle cells can take up glucose. Obesity is characterized, in part, by high levels of plasma glucose and insulin. Studies have shown that mice injected with MSG became obese and eventually lead to insulin-resistance and the onset of Type 2 diabetes. Moreover, MSG has been shown to stimulate appetite in humans. Subjects that had MSG-rich meals exhibited more stimulation to eat and ate more often than control subjects. The elderly are more susceptible to over stimulation of the brain caused by MSG, and risks degeneration of nerve cells in the brain leading to Alzheimers.
3QIWdvG1aa	Initially, the flu may seem like a common cold with a runny nose, sneezing and sore throat. But colds usually develop slowly, whereas the flu tends to come on suddenly. And although a cold can be a nuisance, you usually feel much worse with the flu.<br>  <br>  Common signs and symptoms of the flu include:<br>  <br>      * Fever over 101 F (38 C) in adults, and often as high as 103 to 105 F (39.5 C to 40.5 C) in children<br>      * Chills and sweats<br>      * Headache<br>      * Dry cough<br>      * Muscular aches and pains, especially in your back, arms and legs<br>      * Fatigue and weakness<br>      * Nasal congestion<br>      * Loss of appetite<br>      * Diarrhea and vomiting in children<br>  <br>  When to see a doctor<br>  If you have flu symptoms and are at risk of complications, see your doctor right away. Taking antiviral drugs within the first 48 hours after you first notice symptoms may reduce the length of your illness by a day or two and may help prevent more serious problems. Seek immediate medical care if you have signs and symptoms of pneumonia. These include a severe cough that brings up phlegm, a high fever and a sharp pain when you breathe deeply. If you have bacterial pneumonia, you'll need treatment with antibiotics.<br>  CausesUsually, you'll need nothing more than bed rest and plenty of fluids to treat the flu. But in some cases, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral medication such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza).<br>  <br>  These drugs, which treat both influenza A and B, work by deactivating an enzyme the virus needs to grow and spread. If taken soon after you notice symptoms, they may shorten your illness by a day or so. Oseltamivir is an oral medication, but zanamivir is inhaled through a device similar to an asthma inhaler and shouldn't be used by anyone with respiratory conditions, such as asthma and lung disease.<br>  <br>  Both medications can cause side effects, including lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and trouble breathing. They can also lead to the development of antiviral-resistant viruses.<br>  <br>  In November 2006, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required the maker of Tamiflu to include a warning that people with the flu, particularly children, may be at increased risk of self-injury and confusion after taking Tamiflu. The FDA recommends that individuals with the flu who take Tamiflu be closely monitored for signs of unusual behavior. Discuss possible side effects with your doctor before starting any antiviral medication.<br>  Lifestyle and home remedies<br>  <br>  If you do come down with the flu, these measures may help ease your symptoms:<br>  <br>      * Drink plenty of liquids. Choose water, juice and warm soups to prevent dehydration. Drink enough so that your urine is clear or pale yellow.<br>      * Rest. Get more sleep to help your immune system fight infection.<br>      * Try chicken soup. It's not just good for your soul — it really can help relieve flu symptoms by breaking up congestion.<br>      * Consider pain relievers. Use an over-the-counter pain reliever such as acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) cautiously, as needed. Remember, pain relievers may make you more comfortable, but they won't make your symptoms go away any faster and may have side effects. Ibuprofen may cause stomach pain, bleeding and ulcers. If taken for a long period or in higher than recommended doses, acetaminophen can be toxic to your liver. Talk to your doctor before giving acetaminophen to children. And don't give aspirin to children or teens because of the risk of Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease.<br>  <br>  Prevention<br>  <br>  These steps can help you stay healthy, even at the height of flu season:<br>  <br>      *<br>  <br>        Get an annual flu vaccination. The best time to be vaccinated is October or November. This allows your body time to develop antibodies to the flu virus before peak flu season, which in the Northern Hemisphere is usually December through March. However, getting a flu shot later in the flu season may still protect you. It takes up to two weeks to build immunity following a flu shot.<br>  <br>        Keep in mind that the flu vaccine doesn't offer complete protection, especially for older adults, but it can reduce the risk and severity of illness. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), when the match between flu vaccine and circulating strains of flu virus is close, a flu shot is between 70 and 90 percent effective in warding off illness in healthy people under age 65. It is less effective in older adults. Health experts recommend vaccinations for people over 50 because the flu shot may reduce the risk of flu-related complications, hospitalizations and deaths.<br>  <br>        Healthy people ages 2 to 49 alternatively may receive the flu vaccine via a nasal spray called FluMist. It protects against the same strains of influenza that the flu shot does. Like the flu shot, FluMist is given every year. Because FluMist contains live, but weakened, flu viruses, it shouldn't be given to pregnant|`|01Mu3wUeaa	And what kind of medications did they give you? the flu is a viral infection and not a bacterial infections.Do not take any antibiotics that they give you as 1: they won't work and 2: taking antibiotics when you don't need them is very unhealthy for your body|`|LDLGUtQRaa	sounds like hepatitis to me

I was stuck at my weight loss goals and this brought me through it and made me lose a lot of weight.  So in my opinion it helped me lose weight tremendously.  I know a lot of that dieting stuff is expensive but I found a free trial of Acai Berry(I think it only cost me like 7-8 bucks at the time for shipping.)  The site was   <a href="http://theweightlossplace.com" rel="nofollow">http://theweightlossplace.com</a> -  All I did was try it out for a month and I was sold,  I saw the results I wanted to and like I said I was in that plateau with my weight loss.

Even more than blueberries! Besides that, the nutrients in acai berry supplements help many other diseases and maladies, from diabetes to arthritis to blood clotting. It really is a worthwhile supplement to add to your daily nutrition.<br>  <br>  Acai has great anti-aging benefits, will cleanse and detoxify you, and has destroyed cancer cells in recent studies. You really can't go wrong by adding an acai supplement to your daily vitamin regimen. So far it's working for me by helping my digestion, curbing my appetite, and by giving me more energy each day... I don't even get sleepy around 3pm anymore.<br>  <br>  Acai berries are a great weight loss aid. The berry’s natural concoction of essential fatty acids, fiber, phytosterols and amino acids work together to help your body burn fat more efficiently, process food more quickly and shed the unwanted pounds that you’d like to lose.<br>  <br>  The fatty acids and amino acids aid in both muscle development and proper digestion, both of which are essential to fat loss. The fiber helps your body to move food out of your system quicker and also to help you feel full, as do fatty acids. Phytosterols help fortify your digestive tract, moving waste materials out and absorbing nutrients more efficiently.<br>  <br>  Let me tell you what I recommend, and then I'll tell you why...<br>  <br>  I recommend you get a free trial of Acai Power from <a href="http://barbiefood.com/acai-free-trial.html" rel="nofollow">http://barbiefood.com/acai-free-trial.ht...</a> <br>  This is the product I use, and honestly I feel better every day.

0nZnmb8Zaa	people can get really tired from mono. sharing drinks and other food items can cause you to have mono if u dont be careful|`|3QIWdvG1aa	Mononucleosis, also called “mono,” is a common viral illness that can leave you feeling tired and weak for weeks or months. Mono goes away on its own, but lots of rest and good self-care can help you feel better.<br>  What causes mono?<br>  <br>  Mono is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). It is most often seen in adolescents and young adults. Children can get the virus, but it often goes unnoticed because their symptoms are mild. Adults usually do not get mono, because they have immunity to the virus.<br>  <br>  Mono can be spread through contact with saliva, mucus from the nose and throat, and sometimes tears. Because the virus can be spread through kissing, it has earned the nickname the “kissing disease.” If you have mono, you can avoid passing the virus to others by not kissing anyone and by not sharing things like glasses, eating utensils, or toothbrushes.<br>  <br>  As soon as you get over mono, your symptoms will go away for good, but you will always carry the virus that caused it. The virus may become active from time to time without causing any symptoms. When the virus is active, it can be spread to others.<br>  What are the symptoms?<br>  <br>  The most common symptoms of mono are a high fever, a severe sore throat, swollen glands and tonsils, and weakness and fatigue. Symptoms usually start 4 to 6 weeks after you are exposed to the virus.<br>  <br>  Mono can cause the spleen to swell. Severe pain in the upper left part of your belly may mean that your spleen has burst. This is an emergency.<br>  How is mono diagnosed?<br>  <br>  Your doctor will ask you questions about your symptoms and examine you. You may also need blood tests to check for signs of mono (monospot test) and the Epstein-Barr virus. Blood tests can also help rule out other causes of your symptoms.<br>  How is it treated?<br>  <br>  Usually only self-care is needed for mono.<br>  <br>      * Get plenty of rest. You may need bed rest, which could keep you away from school or work for a little while.<br>      * Gargle with salt water or use throat lozenges to soothe your sore throat.<br>      * Take acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) or ibuprofen (such as Advil) to reduce fever and relieve a sore throat and headaches.<br>      * Avoid contact sports and heavy lifting. Your spleen may be enlarged, and impact or straining could cause it to burst.<br>  <br>  In severe cases, medicines called corticosteroids may be used to reduce swelling of the throat, tonsils, or spleen. Mono is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).<br>  <br>  Cytomegalovirus (CMV) causes some cases of a mono-like illness. Much less commonly, a mono-like illness is caused by different viruses, such as hepatitis B, rubella, and HIV. Toxoplasma gondii, a single-celled parasite, can also cause a mono-like illness.<br>  How mono is spread<br>  <br>  Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can be found in saliva and mucus (and sometimes tears). EBV is not spread by casual contact. You can live in the same house with a person who has mono and never become infected with the virus. But a person who has a weakened immune system may be at higher risk for infectious mono. It's possible that people who have had mono can spread the virus even though they no longer have symptoms.<br>  <br>      * EBV lives and grows in the nose and throat. Any fluid that comes from these parts of the body, including saliva, tears, or mucus, can be infected with the virus. The virus (EBV) is spread when people come in contact with infected fluids.<br>      * EBV can be spread through intimate contact or sharing of saliva. (A brief kiss on the lips is not likely to spread EBV. It is spread when saliva from an infected person gets into another person's mouth.)<br>      * You can get EBV if you share a drinking glass or eating utensils with an infected person (through sharing saliva).<br>      * In rare cases, someone can get an infection after receiving blood from a person who is infected with EBV.<br>      * Most people get infected with EBV at some point in their lives but never get mono symptoms. EBV "sleeps" (is dormant) in the body. It can become active from time to time and spread to others. When it reactivates, most people do not have symptoms. Many healthy people carry the virus and spread it every now and then throughout their lives. Lifetime carriers of EBV are the most common source of EBV infection.<br>  <br>  Contagious and incubation period<br>  <br>      * You can pass the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) to others for several weeks or months during and after the time you are first infected with EBV. The virus can also become active and spread to others from time to time throughout your life.<br>      * There is a small risk of spreading EBV through blood products. If you know you have mono, you should not donate blood.<br>      * It takes 4 to 6 weeks for symptoms to develop after you come in contact with EBV. This is called the incubation period.
u4LLFhORaa	have a check up from a doctor|`|j1yLZ7ozaa	Do you suffer from diabetes? Are you at risk of developing diabetes meaning overweight, eating unhealthy, do not exercise, have sedentary line of work, have diabetics in your family, etc?<br>  <br>  One of the diabetics’ symptoms could be metallic or sweet taste in mouth, so if you are at risk, you should have it checked.<br>  Have you been taking any drugs (medicines)? Different metabolic or gastrointestinal disorders could be causing bad breath and weird taste in mouth, so if your problems persist, why not have a word with a doctor about it and do some tests if necessary?<br>  <br>  Or do you use OUST? If you use OUST it sprays nasty sweet stuff into the air that never goes away. My mom uses it in the bathroom and I can barely go in there.
xzwZ3lt3aa	Don't listen to these kids telling you that you can die if you go to sleep. That is an old wife's tale and not true. If you have a severe head injury, you should be woken every couple of hours. With a mild concussion, there is no need to worry. If you went to the hospital, they would probably tell you to take tylenol, and rest.|`|vkIkFgqiaa	I don't think you can get a concussion from a ball hitting you sorry. I'm not trying to be mean.|`|AA12066269	You could have a minor concussion but a doctor would probably send you home and advise that your parents monitor you.  With minor concussion the best treatment is rest.|`|2I5XqMDzaa	go to the doctor. if u go to sleep with a concussion u could die. it happened to a friend of mine although she was only paralyzed =(|`|DoS1Ow2jaa	YES! go to a doc straight away this sounds quite serious... and yes with concussion if you fall asleep you can die|`|lDtDgI2Eaa	try to stay awake for 24 hours so you dont fall into a coma- and if you dont feel better in 24 hours then go see a doctor|`|k23GYs9iaa	if you have a concussion, you can't go to sleep. the doctor will make  you stay awake because you may slip into a coma. i don't think its likely because it was your face instead of your head. but if you are worried go to the hospital. a bruised brain is no joke. !!|`|5ocMGqlMaa	Anytime the head is involved in an injury, and especially if there are symptoms after, you need to be checked out; even if the symptoms seem like nothing.|`|jydc3MDeaa	I had a concussion a couple of months ago and I had the  headache and nausea like you, but also had some memory loss. I went to the hospital, but there really isn't anything they can do for you there, so they sent me home. Since you didn't lose consciousness or had any memory loss, it is probably a very mild concussion and you will just have some lingering symptoms the next couple of days. <br>  <br>  If at any point you pass out, start bleeding from the ears, or suddenly realize that you don't remember the last four hours, definitely go to the hospital.
JuvkVZvnaa	poor circulation|`|J9HEPVdaaa	Its because you are not moving around enough. Instead of being calm, get up and cause some racket! What do you think you are anyway, about 700 years old and have bones made of sawdust? Go -do- something instead of vegetating online! Just because I'm vegetating doesn't mean you have to!
HsDEPhdLaa	Targetted weight loss is quite difficult, some peeple would declare impossible, but the sole diet which really showed results for me is wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box underneath, they have a few free trials in stock, it has been featured in Reader's Digest and CNN. I melted away thrity pounds, it really does produce success!
5e0c2b6e245998c415bb4509ecae5500aa	I agree with the above answer that it is a need.  I do NOT agree with her that is a "human right".  In some cases we need health care in order to live.  However since it requires the service of another person it is not a right.  Nobody has the right to take anything, be it services or goods, from another person without their consent.  Health care is a service provided by trained individuals for others to BUY from them.  Just like food or shelter.  No one has a right to someone else's food if they're starving, and they don't have the right to someone elses services if they're dying. <br>  <br>  It's not a right, just like social security is not a right.  But by getting the govn't involved people see it as their "right" and it creates havoc down the road, because people expect it.  <br>  <br>  So a gov't should consider it as a want, and not a need, so they aren't tempted to socialize health care.|`|nEVoabeSaa	It is a NEED!<br>  You being a Human NEED, food, water, clothing, a roof over your head to keep you dry and a place to create heat to keep you warm. As long as you have that, you will LIVE. However if you fall ill, well you really NEED a Doctor or health care, otherwise you will die.<br>  Wants are something different, I want the best steak in Town, with the best bottle of wine in the World. I want only the purest of water to drink, I want the best and latest designer clothing. I want at least ten large ranches in various places with at least fifty bedrooms in every ranch house. I can want all I wish too, but unless I have the money, no way am I going to achieve all my wants.<br>  So basic life has needs, because if you are not fed, you will die. However, food, is food, it is not the best steak available.<br>  I think that Health Care is a Human Right.<br>  Best of Luck
iLrp65oXaa	Good carbs or whole grains are slow digesting and keep your full longer.  They also usually have fiber that helps your cholesterol and bowel health.<br>  <br>  Simple carbs (sugar, white pasta, white bread) are quickly digested and lead to blood sugar spikes and plummets that leave you craving more food.  They also have next to no nutritional value.|`|6jSxYrZnaa	Whole grains are not "good carbs". They are bad. All grains are bad. Starches and sugars are also bad. These make up the "bad carbs". Vegetables and fruit make up the "good carbs". <br>  <br>  The first thing to appreciate is that bread, pasta, rice, and all those other bad carbs are not natural. They have not existed for most of our history - they only came into being 10,000 years ago with the onset of the agricultural revolution. That's only 10% of our history. We are not physiologically designed to eat them. Why then should we expect them to be good for us?<br>  <br>  Being specific, bad carbohydrates cause your body to overproduce insulin. Elevated insulin causes us to store bodyfat and also prevents you from burning already stored bodyfat. The rate at which carbohydrates enter the bloodstream as sugar varies - the slower the rate of entry, the lower the insulin response. The rate of entry is measured by the Glycemic Index. The lower the GI level the better. Anything over 80 is very bad, anything under 40 is very good. Bad carbs are also totally deficient in vitamins and minerals. We hear about the "fibre" in cereal and what not. However, there is way more fibre per calorie in a vegetable than any whole grain food. The same is true of any other essential nutrient. Bad carbs are empty and they make us fat and unhealthy. The only thing they have going for them is that they are cheap, easy to mass produce and addictive. In essense, containing insulin levels by getting carbohydrates from vegetables and fruits, is key to health and weight loss.<br>  <br>  This is, frankly, the tip of the iceberg. All the illnesses and diseases of Western civilisation - cancer, diabetes, obesity - are caused by eating this stuff. Those hunter-gatherer societies that do not have access to grains, starches and sugars don't know anything of cancer. When they succumb to Western influence their health will deteriorate. It always does.<br>  <br>  I can recommend some reading, ranging from the easy to the difficult.
sQu3LLqtaa	Boys usually stop growing at 18 so your son is likely to peak at 6'2.|`|13k2WKx8aa	Yes he is Ma'am! ^_^<br>  <br>  Growth normally doesn't stop until around 16-20. Remember though, he might not have as many dramatic growth spurts, but he still has a few inches left in him. At that rate, I can almost guarantee that he's going to break the six-foot mark without a problem.<br>  <br>  Genes are funny things.|`|654c7643984cd6b3f7f0f00356056e81aa	He will most certainly add another several inches--he might even hit six feet...and he will bulk out somewhat between now and when he graduates high school.  Young men grow until they are about 20.<br>  <br>  It is very important that you have him eating healthy meals and snacks, as he can still put on weight in the form of new fat cells; once we stop growing fat cells can only shrink or expand.  So, as fat adults, we can cause those fat cells to grow fatter....the trick is for him not to add new ones now, as he continues to grow and bulk up.<br>  <br>  Healthy eating and life style habits implemented now will last him a lifetime and add years to his life.<br>  <br>  My son was a string-bean at 12-13, and now, at 18, he is 6'-2", 175 lbs. and still growing...he drinks milk, mostly, not soda, eats lots of fruit and veggies and has turned out nicely....as will your son!
RXI8ImdIaa	It's possible that they could interact with other medications that you are taking, if there are any. <br>  <br>  I'll tell you for sure though - "male enhancement pills" do not work, you are wasting your money.<br>  <br>  think about it - if someone discovered a REAL pill that would increase penis size, don't you think it would be the news of the decade?

Although I was<br>  really embarrassed, I asked my doctor what my <br>  options were to get a bigger penis. He recommended <br>  a clinically proven product that really works called <br>  VigRxPlus. I’ve been taking it for 7 months now, <br>  and my penis has grown a little over two inches<br>  with no side effects! <br>  <br>  This is definitely the best product that I have tried. <br>  Don’t waste your time and money on other <br>  products. They just don’t work!

S7rc6mp7aa	I paid only $60 for mine because of this great plan I have. www.healthsavings.ourperfectcard.com I signed up online over 5 years ago now and they have saved me thousands of dollars over the years. From fillings, exams, xrays, cleanings...etc. All services are included in this very affordable plan. They even had my benefits active in 2 hours and was able to use them the very same day. It may vary where you live, but the savings are great. good luck and hope this helps.|`|xbOjNKRFaa	It can cost around $200 for a filling but it keep in mind the larger the cavity the more damage that has been done so the cost may go up. If you wait to long to get the cavity filled and it continues to get bigger it can being to impede on the nerve of the tooth. If that happens you will most likely need a root canal and a crown. So the sooner you can get it fixed the better off you will be.
RXI8ImdIaa	Also if you have insurance, see if your doctor can get you a referral to a nutritionist. That would be the ideal person to talk to!|`|BHGAAAJVaa	Yeah talk to your coach.  I do know that you should eat a lot of protein though.|`|L2InbUACaa	Eat meat, beef and what not, and bananas.|`|PmT8dPEqaa	(aside from working out)<br>  <br>  Drink lots of protein shakes, eat bananas and meats...pasta too =]|`|3bsxb9J3aa	drink more milk.and eat red meats.|`|dfJ8yM4Qaa	ask you gym or football coach.They know you better than we do.|`|vH8QmDESaa	Simply the easiest way to gain weight is to go out and buy protien shake mix (CytoGainer is made specifically for people for need to gain weight) but hold on that is it? No... There a cost, money because protein ain't cheap ma. Second time and dedication.  Go to the gym and find even the football coach or someone you know who lifts a lot.  Usually they would be delighted to help a new person.  Not having protein shakes isn't going to ruin your dream but you are going to have to stay hydrated and heat a lot of healthly foods.  More or less your out to gain muscle.<br>  <br>  So weight lift at least three days a week it is the minimum times you should lift a week.  Go to bodybuilding.com is has a lot of execrises for you to do and has videos of people doing them.  It has workouts you can adopt and design around yourself.
2jMFurDoaa	yeah that is abuse!<br>  <br>  get the hell away from him its only going to get worse. leave him before it gets physical.<br>  <br>  thats emotional and verbal abuse.|`|gkqmrIAGaa	This is horrible abuse. For your own self respect, pride and self esteem you have to get out of this relationship. It always gets worse not better. You want someone who is going to treat you with the love and kindness that you treat him with. This is very, very sick. It might help you to get a little bit of therapy to build you self esteem and to find out why you are putting yourself through this. Think about it you have made the choice to take this. You have a choice to love yourself and find someone who loves you in return. You are in for a life of the most awful misery and this is just the beginning. You cannot love him this is not love that you feel it is a dependancy on him and the way he treats you and you have to get help so that you will know that you deserve the best. You can't see this right now. Please talk to a professional you don't have to tell him what you are doing. But it would be the best for you to get out now. Because when he sees the changes in you and that you are getting stronger he will not like it and will probably get worse.|`|YO1w7gpiaa	It wasn't that long ago that I was sitting in a relationship, much like the one you are in.   I kept my commitments and promises to him, but he turned around and trashed me in return.<br>  <br>  This is/was emotional abuse.<br>  <br>  You deserve respect.  This fellow doesn't know how to "be a man".<br>  <br>  There is something that happens in the head of a woman who lives in a relationship of abuse.  She believes she can control the situation, that there is something she can say or do to make the abuser stop his abuse..........but that is a false belief.....................only HE can stop his abuse.  Only HE can change his mind and his behavior.<br>  <br>  Part of his problem is that he doesn't believe HE has a problem, but the fact is HE IS THE PROBLEM.<br>  <br>  Sorry to say, the very best thing an abused woman can do, in an abusive relationship, is to leave...to let him live with the consequences of his own behavior and attitudes.   The very best thing she can do is to leave for her own safety - and sanity - and because she cares about herself.<br>  <br>  A woman who recognizes the abuse, but chooses to stay, is enabling the abuser's behavior.....feeding the fire within him...letting him act disrespectfully...letting him look like a fool.<br>  <br>  And so, while you are still alive (and I nearly died!!)  When he gets agitated, call 911 and get out...........forever............run for your life.<br>  <br>  Abuse is not love...it can never be love without respect.<br>  <br>  (It took a long time to interpret your wording and read this question through -- next time please use spell-check)|`|4yrqRS4qaa	emotional abuse<br>   <a href="http://www.thisisawar.com/AbuseEmotional.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thisisawar.com/AbuseEmotional...</a><br>  domestic violance<br>  <a href="http://www.thisisawar.com/AbuseDomestic.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.thisisawar.com/AbuseDomestic....</a><br>  <br>  each of these sites have links to where you can get help or more info<br>  <br>  he is very abusive, this is not right, no one should be treated that way<br>  good luck,<br>  take care of you|`|X3500GATaa	Verbal abuse....

Does it take that much longer to put an A in front of the nd?|`|TKf6z1vHaa	It sounds like you are in an unstable relationship and yes this is abuse. Your fiance should not be treating you this way. He needs to treat you better. You have done a lot for him and he is not reciprocating the behavior. I would suggest couples therapy and if that doesn't work, you need to look for someone better, b/c you can do some much better. He sounds really immature and like a jerk.|`|PEN3hha7aa	after having said all that it sounds more like you don't love yourself rather than you love him.  no self-respecting person would put up with that under the guise of love...  you are trying to fool yourself and you are not doing a very good job of it. and you know it.  Get Out Now while you still can...|`|hk5f8yxVaa	Emotional abuse. Get out - now.

3QIWdvG1aa	Topic Overview<br>  What is scabies?<br>  <br>  Scabies is a very itchy skin condition caused by tiny mites that burrow into your skin.

Even people who keep themselves very clean can get scabies.<br>  How is scabies spread?<br>  <br>  Scabies mites spread by close contact with someone who has scabies.

But if you have had it before, symptoms will probably start in a few days.<br>  How is scabies diagnosed?<br>  <br>  A doctor can usually diagnose scabies based on your symptoms. Scabies is especially likely if you have had close contact with other people who have had similar symptoms.<br>  <br>  Sometimes a doctor confirms a diagnosis by looking for signs of mites on a sample of your skin.

To avoid dangerous side effects, be sure to follow your doctor’s instructions carefully.<br>  <br>  If you have scabies, you and anyone you have close contact with must all be treated at once. This keeps the mites from being passed back and forth from person to person. You must also carefully wash all clothes, towels, and bedding.<br>  <br>  After treatment, the itching usually lasts another 2 to 4 weeks. It will take your body that long to get over the allergic reaction caused by the mites. If you still have symptoms after 4 weeks, you may need another treatment.

First use a cotton swab to gently clean the area then clean it with antibacterial soap or you can use peroxide. Do not use alcohol as this may dry your skin. You should be cleaning your piercing at least 2 times a day. Piercings can take up to a year to heal. Do not remove the piercing in case you need to see a doctor, this will help to keep the tract open for drainage and to prevent deeper abcess formation.

However, getting sick is very irresponsible and if it's because you just didn't finish your homework or a project, you are wasting your parents' money on it. Have fun.

Depression often keeps people unmotivated to take care of other health issues so it needs to be addressed since he is bipolar.  He will have to take his meds or you will need to leave him.  He will not get better and behave better towards you without his mood stabilizers.  If he is not willing to take his meds and work towards a more stable life, you have to take care of yourself.  Also ask yourself honestly if he is a risk to himself or others?

XTepTcoCaa	Symptoms of Colon Cancer  Colon cancer is a cancer of large intestine (colon) or rectum (end of colon). What are the symptoms of colon cancer? Read on to get the information about colon cancer.<br>     Colon is the last part of the digestive system. It is a tubular, muscular organ that measures about 4 feet in length. Its main function is to extract salt and water from the solid wastes, before being eliminated from the body and to store and control an elimination of fecal matter. Colon cancer begins in the large intestine (colon) or it starts at the end of the colon, rectum. It is also known as colorectal cancer. Some other rare types of colon cancer are carcinoid tumors, lymphoma, sarcomas and lymphoma. Cancer of colon and rectum is the forth-leading cause of death by cancer in females and the third-leading cause in males. According to the American Cancer Society, every year approximately 1,12,000 people are diagnosed with colon cancer and about 41,000 people are diagnosed with rectal cancer. Well, what are the causes of colon cancer?<br>   <br>   Causes of Colon Cancer<br>   <br>   <br>   In most cases, colon cancer starts as small, benign clumps of cells, known as adenomatous polyps. Over time, these polyps enlarge and degenerate to develop adenocarcinomas, a type of colon cancer. People with adenomatous polyposis syndrome are at the greater risk of colon cancer. This type of colon cancer is more common in the people below the age of 40 years. In case of hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer syndrome, colon cancer may develop without the precursor polyps. It is generally related to genetic abnormality.<br>   <br>   People with ulcerative colitis or Crohn colitis, uterine or ovarian cancer or breast cancer, present or in the past, and people with family history of colon cancer are also more vulnerable to colon cancer. Some other risk factors are obesity, cigarette smoking and diet (not having high-fiber diet). Abdominal pain and tenderness in the lower abdomen are the early symptoms of colon cancer. What are other signs and symptoms of colon cancer?<br>   <br>   Symptoms of Colon Cancer<br>   <br>   In most types of cancer, no symptoms are noticed in the early stage. That's why the cancer remains undetected until it reaches the advanced stage. The same happens in case of colon cancer. Many people don't experience noticeable symptoms during the early stage of the disease. When the symptoms appear, they may vary in severity, depending upon size and location of the cancer. There are significant changes in the bowel habits such as constipation or diarrhea. There are certain changes in the consistency of stool for longer than two weeks. You may experience abdominal pain with a bowel movement, persistent abdominal discomfort such as pain, gas or cramps.<br>   <br>   There is chronic rectal bleeding, which is associated with iron deficiency anemia, fatigue and weakness. Sometimes, rectal bleeding can be detected through a fecal occult blood test. When the tumor enlarges, there may be a partial or complete blockage of colon. In such condition, there are certain symptoms of bowel obstruction such as abdominal pain, abdominal distension, rectal pain, vomiting, nausea and unexplained weight loss. There may be a sensation of incomplete evacuation even after the bowel movement. Whenever you notice the changes in the consistency of stool or presence of blood in stool, you should immediately consult the doctor for an accurate diagnosis.<br>   <br>   Diagnosis and Treatment of Colon Cancer<br>   <br>   <br>   Most colon cancers are caused by adenomatous polyps. Screening can be done to detect polyps before they grow to develop cancer. If colon cancer is detected in the early stage, there are more chances to cure it. Some of the common screening and diagnostic procedures for colon cancer are stool blood test, stool DNA test, flexible sigmoidoscopy, barium enema, colonoscopy and virtual colonoscopy. Once a person is diagnosed with colon cancer, certain tests including chest X-ray, abdominal CT scan and MRI scan are performed to determine the stage of the cancer and to detect whether colon cancer is spread to liver or lungs.<br>   <br>   The treatment option for colon cancer is decided depending upon the stage of cancer. There are three major treatment options such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery. In surgical procedures, the cancerous part of colon is removed, known as colostomy. In case of inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis or familial adenomatous polyposis, entire colon and rectum is removed. If the cancer is in the early stage and localized in a polyp, then it can be removed completely during colonoscopy.<br>   <br>   Colon cancer is, no doubt, a life-threatening disease. Since the symptoms of colon cancer appear mostly in the last stage, it is better to avoid them by regular screening and following a healthy lifestyle. There are a number of options for colon cancer screening such as annual fecal occult blood testing, colonoscopy every 10 years, flexible sigmoidoscopy and|`|AAZ3sNCgaa	Recent studies show that those who consume trans fat have had higher rates of colon cancer.  Your diet also has a big affect on how your digestive system will work and feel.  Visit a regular doctor first to get their advice before assuming the worst.|`|3jFm0rWdaa	There's no reason that should cause cancer.<br>  Are you sure you don't have a gall bladder problem? That would be a lot more likely.<br>  But why doesn't your MD deal with these questions?<br>  But a colonscopy is a waste of money unless you have symptoms like bleeding or something.  And most people who have bleeding have it from hemorrhoids.|`|fACWmhuFaa	Personally I think this is a dietary issue, are you eating enough fibre? you should be having between 20-30 grams of fibre per day, are you drinking 6-8 glasses of water per day?, breakfast should be a high fibre cereal, apples are an excellent source of fibre, as are most fruits.Really you should be avoiding foods with a high proportion of carbs, carbs cannot be broken down and absorbed into the intestine, so will cause flatulence. Avoid beans, peas, broccoli and cauliflower and rasins and prunes as they all fall into this category. If a change of diet doesn't work, then look into a colonoscopy,your bowel habits do point to a low fibre problem
il9Tdmchaa	I think it would be a great idea to see a doctor. You can tell because you came up with the idea and no I don't think you're paranoid but that's the way I felt the first time I went. You have legitimate concerns (they don't have to be life threatening) and they should be addressed by a doctor. Please make the appointment and put your mind at ease.

When they say that Tampax only opens width-wise, they aren't lying. Tampons shouldn't have "sides." I suggest trying a new tampon brand, Playtex, and seeing if that works any better.

It is common with bleach and strong cleaners.  The skin on the neck and face is fragile, and scarring may occur.  I know you don't want to go to the hospital, but you could have a 2nd degree burn.  Burned skin is easily infected, and that can be life threatening.  <br>  <br>  You need medical attention.  Now.  It may be minor, but you could also be compromising the permanent appearance and functionality of your skin.  I've worked in burn units.  You don't want an infection.  I promise.  Additionally, the chemicals can continue to burn even if you wash the skin.  They react with each other (hair dye and magic eraser), and with the cell membranes in your skin.  Once in, washing won't get them off, and more damage will occur.  <br>  <br>  Best of luck.

Make school a wonderful home for you and get a group of friends you can talk to that are healthy. Don't even think about your Dad.

Plus it is so exciting and you are always learning stuff everyday... Plus having that beeper/radio always ready to go off will keep life very exciting.  it is what saved me.  I felt like you did.  Put the red light on your car and become a super hero.  Do it.|`|Phr0pahEaa	this is my advise:<br>  i think you should go to collage. Collage is good because it is like a fresh start, nobody knows you so can start on a good foot this time. Think back on the things that you think you did wrong and set a goal not to make that same mistake. Just keep on going and don't try so hard. "Just be you".<br>  best of luck!|`|SQtqVc09aa	If your a fair student, then go to college. Not only does that give you hope for the future, but if you live on campus, you can recreate yourself and become the person you want to be. Basically, it like a second chance.|`|7vm3iBsQaa	Well, why do you hate your life? Did something happen that made life hateful? Don't think about doing anything bad. When you get older and out of college, maybe things will get better. You might be happier once you are living on your own. Don't judge your life now, wait a little bit, and things might get better. if you really start to hate your life more, where you become completely depressed, go to a doctor or someone that can get things strait. Also, I don't think you are wrong for hating your life, but you are wrong to feel that you don't know what you are going to do with yourself. just keep waiting. good luck|`|Yyt8ZjU2aa	Hey, melancholy cantaloupe! <br>  <br>  I feel your pain. I know how depression/hopelessness can feel. It's hard to deal with such negative feelings. Luckily, you're not clinically depressed. Perhaps you feel as if people don't like you, so you automatically assume that they are hostile/unfriendly. You seem to be very aware and perceptive. Volunteering out of school and participating in school activities both show much potential for success. I think you are being a bit harsh on yourself. You will gradually become more adapted to things as your life progresses. You seem to be on track for someone your age. If you keep your eyes open and work hard, the future will seem much less daunting than it does now. Good luck. And recognize your strengths for what they are!|`|uLtwGhTfaa	In some ways I can relate to you, except I've improved. But you sound awfully smart, really. What do you wish to be different? If it's possible to make it happen , do it. Forget about other people, treat yourself in ways you wouldn't , make yourself feel better. What do you want to be when you grow up? You seem like you can make it happen. It will get better, don't think about suicide.

xCCyGtv2aa	It sounds like the best solution for you will be to plan ahead next time.  If you know that staying up late during a holiday will make it difficult for you to go to bed early the night before school starts, then you probably need to start going to bed earlier several days ahead of time.  I know this is difficult when you're a teenager and want to spend as much time as possible with friends and enjoying your time off, but a consistent bedtime will help you in the future.|`|ea22e726e25a0f023424734447b2abf2aa	next time about a week before you go back start going to bed a little earlier, for now... read a book, it always makes me tired|`|6TVAut8naa	Just relax.<br>  Stay up for as long as you feel for.<br>  When you get tired, then sleep.<br>  <br>  Get up for school when it`s time.<br>  Even though you only get a few hours sleep.<br>  Soon you will learn.<br>  <br>  You don`t need to force it.<br>  But be silent, so you won`t wake others up.<br>  <br>  Enjoy your nightly freedom.|`|ISHIDwawaa	Don't take pills, but how about vitamins? <br>  <br>  Get a multi B-complex vitamin. Ask your mom to get you some allteral at GNC. You probably have a vitamin B shortage, its common for girls to get this when they hit puberty and causes a whole host of problems.<br>  <br>  tryptophan is also good, if you don't want to take it in a pill form eat some peanut butter, turkey, whole grain bread, milk, whole grain cereal, soy beans, or other foods rich in tryptophan.

xCCyGtv2aa	It sounds like you need to discuss this problem with a mental health professional or a doctor.  No one can make a diagnosis for you without seeing you and speaking with you personally.  Bipolar disorder cycles between mania (think hyper) and depression.  People with average brain chemistry do not feel energized after only three hours of sleep, but people who experience mania sometimes do.  <br>  <br>  I strongly recommend seeking medical help right away.  Please do not be embarassed to do so.  If you do receive a diagnosis of bipolar disorder, it will be important to take your medications exactly as they are prescribed, even when you are feeling really good.|`|VHrZumEIaa	I understand. Get to therapy Asap.|`|NlMm6JOTaa	You sound more depressed than you do bi-polar.<br>  I am bi-polar and sometimes i am on top of the world. <br>  The very top.<br>  And everything crashes.<br>  I would def go see my doctor to get a few names of therapist he/she recommends. <br>  Go luck hun.|`|xNBFsEnsaa	The anxiety could lead to a loss of sleep a loss of sleep would lead to constant agitation (anger, aggravation, irritability), This would make you want to be left alone and lead to the thoughts of suicide. These thoughts would lead to lost interests and the isolation. If you want to get better then you have to face what ever caused your anxiety. In other words the anxiety caused everything, get rid of it and everything else should go away. OH AND YOUR DEPRESSED!!!!|`|PcPswmv5aa	Hi.  If you know what triggered it then that is where you start.  You mind is reacting to this trauma trigger.  It does not mean you are 'bi-polar'.  This is an overused term that has never been proven by the medical community.  Talk to a pro about the trigger and with the strategies she gives you, you will begin to improve.  Stay away from prescription drugs.. they do more harm than good.  Your reaction is a totally normal one to a traumatic event.  It happens to so many people.  Now you can start working on your mind to improve your thoughts.  Get to work!|`|TmYTjJT8aa	i think it's obvious that you're depressed. bipolar(ness) is like when you change your emotions constantly... basically like how a woman has mood-swings when she has her period, but if a person is bipolar it's way longer than a week.
b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Having a late period occasionally is not too unusual.  The more you stress about it the later you may be.  Try not to worry too much since you know you aren't pregnant and I am sure you will start when you least expect it.<br>  <br>  best wishes..|`|4adEwhkZaa	Its normal through a women's life to have irregularity in their period. It will range from shorter days to longer lengths between each period. A week is actually a short time missing a period so your fine. I once had a period that was late for 2 months and I never had sex before. It came though. Yes, you will feel a bit nervous and I did too. But its normal and theres nothing truthfully to worry about.|`|a2ol5COXaa	you can just wai a little longer and see,<br>  or go to a doctor, and ask whats wrong
wUMc0hqDaa	Well, it all depends on the reason for your depression, the easiest thing to say is to think of times where you were happy and things that make you happy. happiness is anything that make you feel good about yourself. don't rely on eating to make you happy. you don't want to binge and eat. Think positive and know that there are better days ahead|`|QqY8YgGDaa	-Help others<br>  -Draw cartoons and send to news papers it will change your mood<br>  -I think Tamilnadu ex CMJaya selvi was like you and one answerer above told her to eat and she got the body of elephant!<br>  -You can   write e mail messages to me through this section by clicking my profile|`|LgvOUScvaa	Could it be seasonal?

uVMlNvLoaa	Yeah, that's totally normal. You might experience amenorrhea while on the depo shot (lack of period), or light spotting during the duration of the shot until your body adjusts. I wouldn't worry about it.|`|ME62Mtv4aa	so did your period stop after they gave you the shot? Or you haven't got another period since the last one when they gave you the shot? Sorry a little confused.|`|3a1d98e5d06e33a288cfd5d40b0c4470aa	I can only offer you my comment from personal experience. After I received the depo-provera, now many moons ago, my periods stopped altogether for 4 years. <br>  <br>  During this time, I gained weight, because I enjoyed partying. As soon as I lost the weight, the periods came back. I believe I was extremely lucky that I never got pregnant at that time. I was young and wild, including curious like any youngster. <br>  <br>  I think that side-affects vary from person to person and I wouldn't worry too much about it. I presume you received the shot from your GP and are under medical care of a kind. If you are worried, you can go to a clinic or contact the doctor that gave you the shot.<br>  <br>  If your period stopped that is fine and BTW these are the side affects. The bumps on your face may be related to needing a clean pillow case or having to wash your hair. Maybe change your soap or perhaps moisturiser cream. I do not believe that your skin is affected by the depo-provera. Still, one never knows. Each body acts and reacts differently.|`|FOjumhZqaa	Well usually women who get the depo shot don't have periods at all, I know when I was on it, I didn't get nothing the whole time.  If you don't like not getting a period you should probably switch to a different birth control.|`|xrQQ9Zuyaa	The progesterone in the shot probably stopped the period. What happens next is unpredictable. You may not have another period until you stop using it, you may have unpredictable spotting, you may have regular periods (not likely).<br>  <br>  I am not a fan of this kind of birth control because it only gives you one of the two female hormones, you are being deprived of estrogen. We really do not know what happens with young women who are deprived of estrogen for a long time. There is some suggestion that they are at increased risk for osteoporosis. One shot won't do this, but continuing it might.

0pQKy43yaa	Its normal to worry about what people think, but I think your over-thinking things. You just have to learn how to accept yourself for who you are. Your boyfriend dumped you because he said you cant keep up with his lifestyle??? Honestly that's a lame excuse. He doesn't deserve you, and one day reality is going to hit him and he will realize that fame, money, sex, drugs. All that stuff is worthless. Hes headed down a really lonely road. And yes you will feel good enough when the right man tells and shows you that you are good enough for him.|`|TmYTjJT8aa	well, when you worry about people not liking you, they might end up really doing so. when the dude told you that you couldnt handle his lifestyle, i think he and his band mates already figured your insecurities out. all of that description you posted is because you have a low self-esteem.|`|WEM5n41Oaa	Don't sweat it.  I feel the same way.  Do something for yourself each day.  Buy yourself something nice or treat yourself to a bath or a good movie.  Love yourself.  We all care soooo much about what other people think.  I'm overweight and I've had to love myself even though I don't look the way I'd like to.  I get insecure and down on myself sometimes and I pray to God for help.  I sometimes feel like everyone hates me and sometimes there is some truth to that.  But really I don't hate you and I wouldn't if I knew you in person.  Get yourself together and the right relationship will come along.  What your dealing with is your own inner demons and you should not sweat it.  Your OK just the way you are.  I pray and I know God exist but sometimes He doesn't answer.  Cast your burden on the Lord and He will sustain you.

uVMlNvLoaa	A PAP test is a exam done by your gynecologist or general practitioner to determine for abnormal cervical cells.<br>  <br>  They insert a kind of tubular-device inside of you (some people find it uncomfortable, I didn't have a problem with it) and then widen it, and just put in a cotton swab and swab your cervix and the surrounding area.<br>  <br>  They then look at the cells under a microscope to see if you have any abnormal looking cells, and if you do they will advise you from there to see if you need any further treatment. <br>  <br>  Medical experts advise you to get one once a year as soon as you turn 18 or start being sexually active.

AA12358000	4 Stars,<br>  Not being aware of your medical qualifications, I will deal with this subject in some detail. If you are aware of the details, please pardon this explanation.<br>  In a stage IV decubitus ulcer – “bed sore” – the wound extends through the skin and involves underlying muscle, tendons and bone. The diameter of the wound is not as important as the depth. This is very serious and can produce a life threatening infection, especially if not aggressively treated. All of the goals of protecting, cleaning and alleviation of pressure on the area still apply. Nutrition and hydration is now critical. Without adequate nutrition, this wound will not heal. Anyone with a Stage IV wound requires medical care by someone skilled in wound care. Surgical removal of the necrotic or decayed tissue is often used on wounds of larger diameter. A skilled wound care physician, physical therapist or nurse can sometimes successfully treat a smaller diameter wound without the necessity of surgery. Surgery is the usual course of treatment. Amputation may be necessary is some situations. The treatment for a decubitus ulcer involves keeping the area clean and removing necrotic (dead) tissue, which can form a breeding ground for infection. There are many procedures and products available for this purpose. The use of antibiotics, when appropriate is also part of the treatment. Some deep wounds even require surgical removal or debridement of necrotic tissue. In some situations amputation may be necessary. The second portion of the treatment involves removing all pressure from the involved area(s) to prevent further damage of tissue and to promote healing. Frequent turning is mandatory to alleviate pressure on the wound and to promote healing. As mentioned above, along with cleaning, removal of dead tissue, and alleviating pressure, the individual must have increased nutrition to allow for proper healing of the wounds. Without all of these elements being in place, the wounds will not heal and, in fact, will quickly worsen.<br>  <br>  <br>  ALL ANSWERS SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY RESEARCHED, IN ANY FORUM AND ESPECIALLY IN THIS ONE. -  MANY ANSWERS ARE FLAWED.<br>  <br>  <br>  The information provided here should not be used during any medical emergency or for the diagnosis or treatment of any medical condition.

y4SUDnpaaa	I'm not any kind of professional in mental health but my common sense tells me people are, especially young people,  more likely to be attracted to people around their age because their  association and exposure is mainly with those of comparable age. They would naturally feel more comfortable with their peers. As for adults who are exposed to a variety of people of different ages, I think it is personal preference as to whether they prefer older or younger mates.|`|l0HlqDDMaa	No not really. They may be looking for something in a relationship that is typically found in persons outside of there age group. An example of this would be a 20 year old looking who has a stable career being attracted to older people because of the this similar characteristic. <br>  <br>  I could be considered a problem however if the relationship is used to replace the need for nurturing that is typically given by a parent. This can be a sign of attachment, boundary, and personality disorders.|`|upvLAyyzaa	No...as long as you're an adult...then its not considered abnormal to date someone who is older or younger than you.  Now if you're talking like younger people....like a 15 year old and a 40 year old....of course that wouldn't be right.  So as long as you aren't breaking any laws, I don't see why it would not be considered normal.  My boyfriend is 8 years older than me.|`|XgmO8YIkaa	i dont think so if ur over a cetain age<br>  <br>  if ur older than 21 it doesnt matter unless u marry like a 50 year old which is ewwwww <br>  <br>  do u get my point <br>  hope this helps|`|Vwqaen0saa	Hmm<br>  <br>  Let me think about this|`|33f4c852804fa42db9a7cbb912480080aa	No...Lots of relationships are people at least 5-10 years apart...I think maybe 15-20 years may be pushing it...but not 5-10 years...<br>  <br>  The key is what they have in common, not the age difference...|`|WXExyAlWaa	No. People do talk about things like the Lolita complex (older men/younger girls) but it's actually fairly normal for couples to be made up of an older man and younger woman - though, biologically, a woman hits her sexual peak later than a man does, so the most sexually compatible by age couple would be a younger man with a woman in her early-mid thirties!
3uaIuxz8aa	oh absolutely.<br>  <br>  i'm 19 and i get super horny before my period. My boyfriend loves this "time of the month" lol.<br>  <br>  Just be sure to not indulge in those cravings without the right kind of protection. (birth control or condoms) I'm also talking about protection for your emotional well being.|`|2324ca2619e6dee826826d027a6a3effaa	Yes! I always do. It has a lot to do with when you ovulate. It makes sense that your body wants you to "do it"  a lot before you ovulate so the chance of conceiving is better. Just make sure you are using great birth control!!|`|YPbbBKGaaa	Its normal because as long as you get periods you can have sex and babies +_+|`|uBmomdQCaa	yeah, its absolutely normal.<br>  Im 15 nd I got really horny before my period that I just wanted to go to a party nd hump every guy i saw.<br>  xx|`|aotINbL3aa	i do sometimes not all the time|`|AA11277812	nice
0b719092b4d69772e046d90f96e26879aa	I use Playtex Gentle Glide tampons, and they are easy to get in and out. Don't remove it too early (say after 2 hours) but never leave it in for more than 8 hours. I usually take mine out after 5 to 6 hours.|`|q0Dg8a1haa	You need to take it out every 4-6 hours or so.<br>  <br>  Though I've never actually used one before, so...|`|9EkFrApiaa	Buy ones with a plastic applicator as they go in smoother.  If you bleed heavy, change every couple hours or you are fine for half the day.  I even sleep with them.  Just follow the directions and you will be good.|`|4adEwhkZaa	It depends on the product. The box will tell you the limit to take it out. Also it depends on your flow.If you have a heavy period, best to you use super tampons. I have pretty normal periods and they can be heavy. I use sport tampons because they are small enough for me because I'm small but absorb a lot. I normally keep mine for about 6 hours. Hint that you need to take your tampon out are leaking. Don't have it it too long however but have it long enough so it can absorb and easily be taken out|`|1d9TrIKCaa	Ok :)<br>  You will know when to take it out, because it will start to leak and you will feel it. But NEVER leave it in for more than eight hours, even if it isn't leaking. Try to use the SMALLEST size:regular: and try not to use super...Also regulars Don't hurt to take out, and supers KILL ME!!! Anyways, a good starter is Playtex Sport regular...Hope i helped :)|`|16bWGB14aa	Take them out every 4 to 6 hours or if the flow is heavier take them out every 2 or 3 hours. Try playtex gentle glide or playtex sport/regulars they're both really comfortable and easy to insert and there will be instructions in the box about how to put them in.|`|XKoYg5Whaa	you should change it every few hours<br>  and ou dont have to change it every time you pee either.<br>  maybe the first few days<br>  but as your period gets lighter <br>  you dont have to change it as much<br>  i use tampax pearl.<br>  with the plasitic applicator|`|zW5OWgXtaa	The 360 playtex is best and cheap to. And it depends on how much comes out. So you should change it maybe 2 or 3 times a day, and you can get into a squat position and put a mirrow under your legs and spread open your vagina hole and then get the tampon in. You can first try with a q-tip.|`|CHe30rdiaa	i started with the playtex sport, they slide in pretty easily.<br>  i'd say after five or six hours (sometimes more, sometimes less) but it just depends on the flow. or when you notice leaking is definitely the time to change it but don't leave it in for too long.<br>  so lets say you put one in in the morning, then at lunch, then maybe when you come home from school or around dinner and then before bed (you'll develop a system once you get used to them)|`|qTqjlHDtaa	i think playtex sport is a good brand.:] or tampax pearl:] and you shouldn't leave a tampon in for more than 8 hours thats the max, but don't even leave it for 8 hours, you never want the risk of toxic shock syndrome. so 6 hours should be long enough. good luck=]|`|ULo8Cwdfaa	Use plastic applicators instead of cardboard, they are much better, and go in smoother. <br>  <br>  I use the sport ones. and it depends on your flow whether you should get light, regular, or super.|`|SQLSOeHcaa	THE ONES WITH THE PLASTIC APPLICATORS ARE THE BEST!<br>  <br>  <br>  CLICK ON THESE LINKS, GREAT INFO:<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Use-a-Tampon" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Use-a-Tampon</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.simplydiscrete.com/14.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.simplydiscrete.com/14.html</a>|`|HlT6Zq37aa	definately playtex sport or maybe tampax pearl<br>  the 360 opening is wayy better tho so id go wit playtex sport<br>  n around every 3-7 hours<br>  :]|`|CmVetzjZaa	well it's not if you know when you should have it in for a certian period of time around 3hours or 4|`|D7vdPDOOaa	well you should switch your tampton every 6 hours same with a pad. so if your on a heavy flow then change it every 5 hours but you need to change it every 6 hours for sure. and you just pull on the string to ake it out obviously. buy any brand beacuse they are all the same but get it from a good store like wal-mart, or pharmcy but not the dollar store beacuse thet are cheap so they are obviously not gona work to good. hope this helps|`|qoI6lrvZaa	personally, I'm a "pearl girl." Tampax pearl is the greatest brand ever. Pricey, but great. you sound young so i'd go with junior or slim sized tampons. take it out every 4 to 6 hours. In the beginning you might want to change your tampon every 2 hours until you decide how heavy your "flow" is. Once you have decided on the proper size and absorbency, 6 hours should be fine. To take it out you just pull straight down on the string at the end. If you see blood on this string then you know it wont be long until some severe leakage occurs. You shouldn't have a problem. Tampons are so much better than pads!|`|VpAOZZyoaa	use tampax i think it is called.. and use the regular size. if you have a heavy period then take it out every 1-2 hours also if you cant feel it anymore, then it is time to change it. (i do that) <br>  if you are light, then you will be able to fell that it is kinda hard still and that means it is still good to use. I wouldnt sleep with it in. it is not good for you. If you are light then you dont need to sleep with anything but if you are heavy then use a pad or whatever you use now. ANd remember not to keep it in longer then 5/6 hours. The box says 8 hours but dont listen to that. <br>  <br>  hope i helped!|`|10Eh9sP6aa	I just know because I go by how the flow is if it's heavy I'll take it out every 1-2 hours if it's light I'll leave it in for 4 hours. You can get ones that have a little skirt or whatever you want to call them so if you get really worried get those and also if it's your first time you should wear a pantie linner too. Good luck! :)|`|HUTM1xXdaa	i use pearl and tampax sport i love them they are very comfortable and you dont even know you have one in. taking them out is different for everyone it depends how heavy your period is, if its heavy check it at least every 3 hours sometimes sooner if its light you can let it go longer|`|CXSVaiBMaa	i like the playtex sport or tampax sport idk wut there called something sport they are the easiest to put in. yea it tells u how long they can stay in usually about 4  hours or if ur leaking it prolly means its full and u need to take it out|`|wobRTCvHaa	it doesnt really matter what brand to use,<br>  as long as its plastic, thats the best kind.<br>  and you will kind of know when to take it out, it<br>  will start to like slide out a little bit. if not,<br>  just like every 3 or 4 hours.|`|yFKQFeeJaa	Always start off with the super super tampons with no applicator.

8Ak1FehYaa	when I use to worry myself into insomnia I use to mediatate, just think about the fact of sleep, sleep sleep, that was all I woudl think about as much as often as I could, sleep sleep sleep, I would not allow anything else in my mind but going to sleep, being religious I woudl say the lord's pray,over an dover again, but if your not relgious this will nto help, evetually my mind would calm down and I would relax and fall asleep. or I would eget p and do soemthign with my time and then I would be so sleepy that I would fall asleep the case being that I had soemthign to do and I was keeping myself awake until I did it.|`|3JUKOGOvaa	i know how you feel when ur up. when i am manic and ready to goo i have a puff or two of a joint and it usually kills the mania as well as helps me sleep.

xrQQ9Zuyaa	You are unlikely to have a growth spurt, that happens just before and during puberty. You are finished puberty, and you will almost certainly remain 5 ft 1 in. That is a perfectly good height for a woman, well within the normal range.|`|0ixo6bkdaa	You will probably grow about 2 more inches!|`|OqjxyYxqaa	you are going to be short fo' life! get over it and practice standing on your toes to see over people that are taller than you. you will fail at life and eventually become a hobbit with furry toes.
DOfe4s4Paa	well....  1st of all drink plenty of water.  exercise ,yoga,meditation..is a must.  avoid/limted consumption of fatty foods and saturated foods.  if possible eat a banana 1/2 or 1 hour before your lunch.  that will help u to eat less.|`|a0v3q3J4aa	Hm...it is entirely possible that you have too much sodium in your system?

Try upping your water intake.|`|QbcnDDxUaa	try exercising and meditating..also do yoga..it will definitely help
9U5GV6xmaa	I would use those bottles of Neet, or Nair. Rub on, wait, then shower off. You can use a razer blade for armpits, and legs.<br>  <br>  I have never shaved my legs, as I am one of the lucky few, who has hairless legs!!!My arms have a bit of hair. If I would do anything for your arms, I would shave or use the Neet.<br>  <br>  But think of the bright side. I bet you have great hair on your head, I would love that, and great for styles!!

They slowly destroy the hairs making them grow back finer and lighter.<br>  <br>  If you don't fancy that then you could try a number of things, feel free to experiment with whatever you want.|`|EgPIOWgbaa	I have lots of hair on my arms and legs too. But now I shave my legs. When it comes to your arms, be proud! When it comes to summer and the sun is out, rub lemon on the hairs and sit in the sun.

t4DP30r6aa	These are too many questions to answer directly.... However, a couple of things you need to be honest with yourself. Why do you want to adopt vs have your own baby? Is it fear of the birth process? if so epidurals are available and the baby is a great reward. Adoption is a tricky concept, you have to be willing to have additional problems that you may never know the answers to. For example research continually shows that although nurture is important we can not get past the fact of nature. You may not know history of diseases in that child's family, such as psychological or physical. Inevitably the child will one day know that they will be adopted.. Probably not until later in life (like teens) but it will be an issue when it comes up. You will need to be prepared for this and willing to work through this, also willing to work through it when/if the child decides to attempt to find their own parents. And of course a child will yell at you " I don't have to listen to you you're not my mom!" at least once after they find out. That's what teens do when they are upset. If you are serious about this you need to do some research. First, why not read the classic "what to expect when expecting" that will give you a good idea of what happens "after you find out your pregnant". Then find a book about adoption. First, ask yourself are you ready for a baby at all?|`|lY2XI8kUaa	the blood drawn thing isn't too bad if you get someone who knows what they are doing. it is the best thing to get it done, so you know if you have any sexually transmitted disease or if you are anemic, diabetic and things to that nature. you will have a few (like 3 or 4) the first trimester, then the second one you will go 2 times a month and the last trimester every week. or at least that is how my doctor did it. most of the time complations are rare, and most of the time things go right. i got my pre-pregnancy body back pretty fast, but i also ate healhtly through both pregnancies. you cant tell i had 2 kids either. you should be able to drink 2 cups of coffee while pregnant. i drink soda and it didnt hurt my kids. i hope this helps some.|`|PTsuqdJhaa	well with the blood i am pretty sure you can refuse it, but it would be best for you and the baby if they take it because that can tell them if anything is wrong that may affect the baby and yourself.  After you have found out that you are pregnant make an appointment with a doctor, they will give you another test, then a pap smear, and set you up for appointments after that to come in for ultrasounds and check ups, as well as setting you up for prenatal vitamins.  Visits can occur in a hospital or in the doctors office, which ever they would refer you to- you can either have a midwife come to you or choose a hospital.  A midwife will get you comforted and ready for your labor.  When you are in labor they will help with your breathing and is responsible for the times you need to push and the delivery of the baby.  You wouldnt need to be in a hospital with so many people around but i would say because of the medications in the hospital it would be better.  If you dont take care of yourself, because your immune system is low from taking care of yourself and the child, complications may be higher than normal.  There is a chance, but most likely you will have gained weight that you may want to lose in order to return to the size you were before.  When it comes to caffeine, try to stay away from it altogether.  I am guessing once in a while it may be alright, but not everyday.<br>  <br>  <br>  I honestly dont know the cost and process of adoption but i do know that the child will not hate you.  If anything you are giving it a home that their parents couldnt give them.  You will get to choose the child that you want.  You should know which child you and your husband will love, it will come naturally to you both. <br>  <br>  I would suggest that after a home birth you go to the hospital and get admitted.  You may not need to but to make sure about the complications, you may want to.  I believe that the midwife will stay with you a while after you have the baby to make sure everything goes well.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

K5uoaetaaa	No.  Birth control actually stops you from ovulating, and although you have a regular bleed it is not a menstrual period.  It is not a good idea for a child to take regular strong doses of hormones for no good reason, so don't.|`|4d609fcce5f5f73d048fa387f7f37eacaa	Short answer: No. It won't help.

You will need a prescription from your doctor and can buy them at the pharmacy.  The cost depends on which pill is prescribed.  Your doctor will probably recommend vaccines before you travel too.
0Jdubcj2aa	I don't know if there is a name but I understand where you are coming from as I have been asking myself the same question for ages. For example, I kept getting eye pains. I went to the Doctor and they said I was fine..just need to wear my glasses more. I thought, 'oh, is that it?!' I don't know why but I felt, like, kind of disappointed in a way! That has happened a few times now. I think with me, I liked the attention and love i was feeling from my family and boyfriend so when I realise I am ok, I feel bad as I want to be loved and made to feel important or something. PLEASE don't feel alone in this. I think maybe we need to get some focus in life. Try doing things you enjoy and that make you feel special even if it's cooking or simply playing some sport or something. Hope I have helped you. x|`|C2ngW2hvaa	This is strange- but I really want to obtain an eating disorder.  A doctor told me I was in the middle 50% for my height and I was 'average' and I thought to myself "average? I wish I were underweight" and now I have been trying to diet and I obsess about weight/body image/ what others think/etc but it's not a full blown eating disorder (I haven't lost much weight) and I envy those who do have an eating disorder because they have lost so much weight.  <br>  It sounds so ridiculous (and it's so wrong) but I guess I know where you're coming from.

She gets hers from mostly stress (anxiety) school and friends can be hard sometimes. Anyway, what helps her is depending on your weight she is overweight so her doctor told her she can take 4 advil but take only 2 if your average weight, goes into a dark room with nothing on (tv off radio off cell phone off) and puts a cool wet wash cloth over her eyes and lies down. Try to take a nap. You might be starting migraines, she started with them only 3 months ago.I hope this helps, feel better. <br>  P.S.

But if it doesn't you should probably go see a doctor, something could be going wrong.|`|sdUgxmYzaa	Try taking medicine & laying down in a pitch dark room and see if that helps and if you still have it after a few days then go to the doctors.|`|4mcFd5Juaa	You may have a migraine, or you could be coming down with a flu.

Eventually the cancer will grow large enough to invade nearby organs and tissue and that is when problems with pain can begin. A large tumor pushes organs out of the way, compress the heart, invade the organ, press on nerves . . and create a constant painful situation . . this is if the cancer stays untreated. The tumor will continue to grow and eventually reaches a point where it shed malignant cells into the blood stream or lymphatic system and sends new cancer all over the body. Those cells begin to grow and create new tumors everywhere .. again pressing on nerves, compressing organs, pinching off the colon, interrupting the normal functions of the human body . . untreated the body eventually cannot function any longer and the person will die from lack of oxygen, lack of liver or kidney function, or a burst tumor . .any number of things . .bacterial infections. <br>  <br>  So, the answer is . . in the final stages cancer can become agony. Fortunately there is palliative care to reduce the suffering and patients are given as much pain medication as necessary to stay comfortable until the pass away.|`|hBmafVYoaa	Goodness yes.|`|MLvwZ7uAaa	I think so.

I got usted to them, and when they switched the type of contacts from the smaller ones to the larger ones, I got usted to them right away.

I never go without them!<br>  Good luck!|`|SCeIOtZpaa	I remember thinking how weird they felt in, but I forced myself to wear them a few hours a day.  It took FOREVER for me to get them in, getting them out was really easy for me.  Just make sure they are not inside out when you try to put them in - that always makes them pop out and can cause a lot of frustration. <br>  <br>  I have had contacts for 8 years now, and sometimes they still bug me and I wear glasses for a day or two, but out of the 365 days a year I probably wear my contacts 300 days a year.|`|ZtECjEPyaa	i got my contacts about 4 weeks ago. when i first got them they were REALLY hard to put in and out and it was really fustrating. sometimes i would be late to school becuase i just couldn't get them in (and sometimes when i did, they made my eyes burn). they can get really annoying but overtime as you keep putting them in and taking them out, you'll get used to them. now i can't even leave the house without them! AND i can get both of them in, in like less than a minute =]. So the thing is, yes they will get annoying the first time you get them but its worth it because in a week or two, they'll be really easy to put in!|`|aXXTHpHBaa	Omg the beginning is a living hell!

Removing them is way easier than putting them in so don't worry. And make sure your hands are clean. Hope I helped.

uVMlNvLoaa	My mother taught me this neat trick to prevent the blood from leaking when you sleep on your back.<br>  <br>  Take a piece of tissue or toilet paper, fold it up, and then fold it into between the cheeks of your buttocks. It prevents it from leaking through onto you and your mattress.<br>  <br>  Overnight pads are nice, but I don't use them alot. They can really help with heavy periods though.<br>  <br>  It doesn't really matter what you wear to bed--just don't not wear anything!<br>  <br>  When you wake up, change the pad or insert a tampon, and wipe yourself well--might take a few wipes and wads of toilet paper if you flow is heavy at night.|`|QJHE3z1raa	1.overnight pads are amazing.<br>  2.

(i recommend the ones with wings) since your tossing and turning while you sleep the wings will prevent anything from slipping to the side of the underwear. [:<br>  and when you wake up check to make sure you didnt stain the bed. blood is very difficult to wash off. <br>  so if you by any chance did stain your bed use hydrogen peroxide - let it soak and wash with cold water.<br>  and make sure you change to your regular day pad in the morning. use a wipe if you want [: it'll make you feel fresh and you get all the overnight bacteria  out. (thats what usually causes itching or infection)<br>  hope this helped a bit<br>  -andreaa<3|`|AA10358331	Since my periods are a little weird, they tend to lighten up in the evening. So i use regular pads. (Before I was on birth control i did use over night pads).  To me they don't feel like a diaper, but you can tell that its there. I Normally sleep with some type of shorts on when i sleep, just in case it does leak. It is possible that i can leak because the blood can go anywhere before its absorbed by the pad. If you don't want to sleep with shorts, you can always sleep with a towel under you. Any time I wake up and half to pee at night I always go instead of waiting. Just in case the blood has leaked. When I wake up, I would clean my self with the flushable wipes, change the pad and start getting ready for the morning.|`|0b719092b4d69772e046d90f96e26879aa	Use over night pads for when you sleep. They are just longer than normal pads, so they don't feel like a diaper. It doesn't matter if you wear shorts or pants to bed-it's whatever you prefer. When you wake up, just throw the over night pad in the garbage, and put in a regular one or a tampon (if you use those).<br>  <br>  xoxLina|`|CqldGgFCaa	i use regular <br>  overnight are to bulky and yeah kinda like a diaper<br>  and you can wear shorts as long as you have underwear on underneth<br>  and when you wake up you go to the bathroom and change it|`|K6XZ18uHaa	i just wear regular ones, but sometimes i wear 2 if its heavy.  you don't really need to wear shorts thats only if you're paranoid that its going to leak.  just change it when you wake up.|`|xwgH7dRSaa	I just use regular pads. They are not the most comfortable things in the world to sleep in, but it isn't very uncomfortable either.  I always wear just a tshirt and panties to bed, so I don't think it would be dangerous per se to not wear shorts.  Now, you may have a leak on the sheets, but it is pretty easy to clean up.  Just run some cold water on the stain and rub the spot to get some of the excess out.  Then, spray it with some prewash spot spray like Spray N Wash or something and then wash them.|`|wTvlreI7aa	It's best to use overnights because you have to go all night unless you want to wae up to change it (I don't).

Vk7kkrcLaa	if its still painful after removing the lens then this is the classic sign of some sort of corneal infection or severe abrasion. you need to go to eye casualty or the doctors asap, they can prescribe drops if it is an infection and lubricants to help ease the pain<br>  <br>  also, leave you lenses out for the nest few days or until the problem completely resolves.|`|968YIknKaa	could be a corneal problem like bacterial ulcer or infiltrative keratitis.<br>  <br>  gotta go to the eye doc

Add whatever portion your insurance paid plus whatever your out of pocket was, and a replacement should cost about that much.<br>  <br>  2) If it fell out because there is decay underneath or if the tooth cracked then it could cost more to fix it depending on how much tooth structure is remaining. It could be as little as just replacing the filling or as much as a root canal and crown. <br>  <br>  Only a dentist can tell you exactly what you need to restore your tooth. They will take an x-ray  and let you know. Most offices work out payment arrangements with their cash-paying patients, so just ask.|`|N6TCELEzaa	Depends what country you live in obviously!

4xThujMcaa	Hun, the pressure of the water will stop your blood flow, so going swimming without a tampon is fine! If you will be in the water for the whole session then don't worry and relax! <br>  Though If you are in and out of the water (e.g. Diving/Lifegurad training) The it could be a slight problem if your flow is heavy, because your flow will start again as soon as you are out the water. <br>  <br>  If you are in the water the whole time just make sure that as soon as you get out instead of hanging around, go and put your pads on straight away! <br>  <br>  However it would be better to use a tampon if you are comfortable with using them. If you aren't comfortable it really doesn't matter. You may find that when you get older you will want to use them.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped x|`|ypII7xzbaa	Well personally tampons are a HUGE pain. So, this is what i do, if the flow is too heavy, then I guess I'll wear tampon, but since im kinda self conscious about it, il put a panty liner on (it doesnt come out, its ok :]). But if its lighter, then put the panty liner on, then before you get freaked out about the whole "leaking" thing, take a shower and get yourself completely soaked (you're supposed to take showers before hitting the pool right?). Then it gets even lighter. Then you shouldnt have a problem. I hope this helps!! Good lluck|`|FpwRrOwxaa	I don't know. It depends.

278113a07b7b6648ec6e32639de20bf9aa	Well, that's odd because my mother, who has been an asthmatic for 20 years, started putting honey in her tea instead of sugar and after a year noticed her asthmatic symptoms improving.  <br>  <br>  I know she eats peanut butter, too, but people who are allergic to peanut butter are HIGHLY allergic.<br>  <br>  Milk - I understand that one.  I have (undiagnosed) asthma.  I didn't want to go the route my mom went w/ the inhalers and steroids.  I actually am symptom free as long as I avoid dairy products and most yeast (which is difficult to do).  I drink rice milk or almond milk, and just have cheese occasionally.  The thing about milk (and dairy) products are that they are prone to produce mucus in the body, which aggrivates asthma.  I have noticed this for me.  My mom still eats huge bowls of ice cream almost every night.  If she would cut back, I think her symptoms would be reduced as well.  It's not something she is willing to sacrifice for her health, though, unfortunately.|`|4ASDeXsgaa	I have asthma and can have as much peanut butter honey and milk I want, there is no correlation with this causing inflammation of the lungs
Ghu73ELNaa	Your hymen is not 'ripped', its streched or torn and its probably already happened before now either playing sports or some girls are even born without them. <br>  Sex is often painful the first time but shouldnt hurt that much if your relaxed and wet (get some foreplay going on to make you wet e.g your partner to finger you etc)<br>  <br>  And of course its not bad for you!!! Sex is what were here for, its natural and the only way to reproduce.|`|IFd94XDkaa	It hurts but it doesn't have to be bad.  Relax, the more tense you are the more it will hurt but if you relax and get into it you may not have any pain to speak of. <br>  <br>  Make sure your guy gives you lots of stimulation because the foreplay causes your vagina to lubricate and loosens the muscles. Very important!!  In fact if he gives you an orgasm before penetration it will cause your vagina to lengthen slightly.<br>  <br>  It will help with the pain if either you or he is stimulating your clitoris while he is penetrating you for the first time, it will distract you and relax you if you allow yourself to get into it.  Once he is in you, he should stop and let you adjust before he begins to move, then he should start moving in and out slowly as you continue to adjust.  <br>  <br>  You shouldn't go for marathon sex right at first. Tell your boyfriend that he shouldn't try to hold his orgasm back. Guys sometimes have the idea that they should be able to go forever before orgasming. That is fine for later but for your first time he shouldn't try to last a really long time. It will end up being painful for you if he does. <br>  <br>  Again, I want to stress that having your orgasm before penetration will be best for you. It's highly unlikely that you will have an orgasm during penetration. Thinking that you will, will lead to frustration and that's not good for either you or him.|`|AA12269955	Sex tends to be messy simply because of your lubrication and his ejaculations, but if you're worried about excessive bleeding, don't be. It is very rare that you'll bleed enough to be concerned over.<br>  As well, you've probably ripped your hymen before now during daily activities, such as excercise, bike riding, etc. And if you're partner is careful and responds to your body there shouldn't be a problem. <br>  What makes you describe it as ripping through your hymen anyways? Sex is not (usually) a violent act, there shouldn't be any "ripping" through anything|`|wol6ECnQaa	First, If your hymen is already broke due to other activities that can break it, you shouldn't bleed. It's only when the hymen rips for the first time that you will bleed. A few table spoons of blood +/- you can expect.<br>  <br>  The most important thing is to be well lubricated before penetration and to take your time. Make sure he eases himself in you and not just jam it in. If you have to guide him then do so.<br>  <br>  You will feel pain initially yes, but don't worry because this is actually a pleasurable learning experience so loosen up.|`|PGTM31Vdaa	Geez. Ripping sounds so violent.<br>  Some girls report a lot of pain, some girls report no pain at all. It depends on the girl's body and the guy's as well. <br>  When a hymen tears, yeah, it's going to hurt. You're busting skin open there. Most of the time it'll bleed, but it's normal. If it is your first time, you might want to put down a towel or use old sheets just in case it does get messy. There's no gushing of blood or anything though. Just go slow.|`|vPzA4eqzaa	Not to put you off or owt but it hurts like hell the first time! I wouldnt say it is messy though. A lot of girls tend to bleed after their first time so dont be worried if this does happen. You will just have to see through the pain and think about the pleasure.|`|nLXfeQbpaa	It does not hurt and it's not messy at all. <br>  The blood is minimal and hardly noticeable<br>  If you've played sports and swam alot then it could already be broken.
kjW1fmmPaa	That is just sad and unhealthy.  Don't let the media brainwash you.  I know some girls who prefer darker skinned males, it can be very attractive and you can pick up lots of exotic looking girls that way too.  Please don't be ashamed of your skin colour, the world is messed up enough as it is.  White people try to be gangsta and "act black" (whatever that actually means), and black people (men and women) buy skin bleaching creams to try to be more white.  Everyone wants to be someone else.  It really is sad.<br>  <br>  You can get a job no matter what your skin  colour.  I am not saying there is no discrimination because obviously there is, but I wouldn't want to be hired by a discriminatory employer anyway.  Just get an education and wear a nice shirt to get a job, lightening your skin won't get you a job that education won't.  Just try to be happy with yourself, and say F*** society!

If it keeps going, you can always go to your doctor and get checked - they can give you something to help. Only way you will know what it really is - since it has already been 3 wks, that's a bit long and you might want to consider the MD visit this week.   Definitely go to the MD if the mucus turns yellow or greenish as could be a sign of infection (of course if you start feeling bad, or start running a temp.)<br>  <br>  You may suffer from panic attacks more right now if you are having difficulty breathing-  I know that can happen to me with a cold.|`|z0torDIWaa	hmm well i was going to say either allergies or a cold...<br>  but then i saw the white mucus stuff. i have no idea with that?!!?!? maybe like an infection? i dunno are you sure it was white? like really white or just tinted? thats sooooo weird.

3QIWdvG1aa	Home treatment is usually all that is needed for a sore throat caused by a virus. These tips may help you feel better.<br>  <br>      * Gargle with warm salt water to help reduce swelling and relieve discomfort:<br>            o Gargle at least once each hour with 1 tsp (5 g) of salt dissolved in 8 fl oz (237 mL) of warm water.<br>            o If you have postnasal drip, gargle often to prevent more throat irritation.<br>      * Prevent dehydration. Fluids may help thin secretions and soothe an irritated throat. Hot fluids, such as tea or soup, may help decrease throat irritation.<br>      * Use a vaporizer or cool air humidifier in your bedroom.<br>            o Warm or cool mist may help you feel more comfortable by soothing the swollen air passages. It may also relieve hoarseness. However, don't let your room become uncomfortably cold or very damp.<br>            o Use a shallow pan of water to provide moisture in the air through evaporation if you don't have a humidifier. Place the pan in a safe location where no one will trip on it or fall into it.<br>      * Do not smoke or use other tobacco products and avoid secondhand smoke. For more information, see the topic Quitting Tobacco Use.<br>      * If you suspect that problems with stomach acid may be causing your sore throat, see the topic Heartburn.<br>  <br>  Consider taking nonprescription medicine for your symptoms.<br>  <br>      * Use nonprescription throat lozenges.<br>            o Some nonprescription throat lozenges, such as Sucrets Maximum Strength or Spec-T, are safe and effective and have medicine (local anesthetic) that numbs the throat to soothe pain.<br>            o Regular cough drops may also help.<br>      * Use a decongestant.<br>            o Decongestants make breathing easier by shrinking swollen mucous membranes in the nose, allowing air to pass through. They also help relieve a runny nose and postnasal drip, which can cause a sore throat.<br>            o Decongestants can be taken orally or used as decongestant nasal sprays. Oral decongestants (pills) are probably more effective and provide longer relief but may cause more side effects.<br>            o Do not give decongestants to a child younger than 2 unless your child’s doctor has told you to. If your child’s doctor tells you to give a medicine, be sure to follow what he or she tells you to do.<br>  <br>  Medicine you can buy without a prescription Try a nonprescription medicine to help treat your fever or pain:<br>  <br>      * Acetaminophen, such as Tylenol or Panadol<br>      * : Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)<br>            o Ibuprofen, such as Advil or Motrin<br>            o Naproxen, such as Aleve or Naprosyn<br>      * Aspirin (also a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug), such as Bayer or Bufferin<br>  <br>  Safety tips Be sure to follow these safety tips when you use a nonprescription medicine:<br>  <br>      * Carefully read and follow all directions on the medicine bottle and box.<br>      * Do not take more than the recommended dose.<br>      * Do not take a medicine if you have had an allergic reaction to it in the past.<br>      * If you have been told to avoid a medicine, call your doctor before you take it.<br>      * If you are or could be pregnant, do not take any medicine other than acetaminophen unless your doctor has told you to.<br>      * Do not give aspirin to anyone younger than age 20 unless your doctor tells you to.<br>  <br>  Additional home treatment can be found in topics related to sore throat.<br>  <br>      * If you suspect allergies are causing your symptoms, see the topic Allergic Reaction or Allergic Rhinitis.<br>      * If you have laryngitis, see laryngitis.<br>      * If your sore throat is caused by sores in your mouth, see the topic Mouth Problems, Noninjury.<br>  <br>  Symptoms to Watch For During Home Treatment<br>  <br>  Use the Check Your Symptoms section to evaluate your symptoms if any of the following occur during home treatment:<br>  <br>      * Drooling or increased difficulty breathing develops.<br>      * Inability to swallow or drink enough fluids develops.<br>      * A muffled voice develops.<br>      * A new rash or fever develops.<br>      * Signs of dehydration are present.<br>      * A persistent sore throat or fever develops.<br>      * Symptoms become more severe or more frequent.<br>  <br>  Prevention<br>  <br>  There is no sure way to prevent a sore throat. To help reduce your risk:<br>  <br>      * Drink enough fluids to prevent dehydration.<br>      * Wash your hands often, especially when you are around people who are sick.<br>      * Identify and avoid irritants, such as smoke, fumes, or yelling, that cause a sore throat.<br>      * Do not smoke or use other tobacco products and avoid exposure to secondhand smoke. For more information, see the topic Quitting Tobacco Use.<br>      * Avoid contact with people who have strep throat.<br>      * If you have mononucleosis, do not share eating or drinking utensils to prevent spreading the virus to others. A brief kiss on the lips is not likely to spread mono; it is spread when saliva from an infected person enters another person's mouth.|`|1cec78892e2912eecfe0874cf01092afaa	tonsillitis is the inflammation and swelling of the tonsils due to a bacterial or viral infection.

Why?<br>  <br>  Mostly there isn't an effect on daily routine. I did used to get such bad cramps I vomited - had to stay home those days, otherwise there isn't a problem. <br>  <br>  Bad things: the pain, the mess, the heavy unexpectly bleeding that makes you think "sh*t this on on my trousers isn't it?" the tiredness, bloating, sudden craving for foods (sometimes, chocolate, sometimes crisps, sometimes vanilla yoghurt... that might just be me). It's just not pleasant. Especially when you're staying with someone and worry you'll sleep funny and blood will leak onto sheets (did happen a few times - no idea how).<br>  <br>  Good thing: knowing I'm (probably) not pregnant. (my mum still had periods while she was pregnant with me)<br>  <br>  It's not as if we lose a lot of blood. About 2 tablespoons I think, over 5-7 days. It's messy, and makes me feel a bit drained when it's heavy, but no where near enough to threaten how I do my job. A few painkillers for cramps/headaches and carry on. Sometimes it doesn't stop the pain completely, which makes me a bit grumpy. When bleeding is heavy I wear a high absorbancy tampon backed with a pantyliner and change it every few hours. A few extra bathroom breaks is maybe the only effect on my routine.<br>  <br>  Young girls often want it to start to feel grown up, it's a kind of rite of passage, but after that first few times, it's a chore and marked on your calender as 'here we go again!'<br>  <br>  I'm actually on birth control that's stopped my periods (checked with doc, it's fine) - I'm happier without my period!|`|LHxDNIWGaa	I absolutely dont like anything about getting my period!|`|LnTgn2YTaa	the only thing i loveabout it is days of work and school XD

o0JD0hitaa	Yes - Reiki does produce a lot of different sensations<br>  <br>  The most common ones for me, my students, and others I've talked with include: heat, cold, tingling, "magnetic" pulsing drawing the hands in or pushing them away, and a feeling like flowing water. I've had a few students report a feeling of an occasional breeze going up and down the arms. People also generally feel good when doing Reiki - I've been known to do hours of Reiki without feeling hungry at all until I stopped (5 hours later) - and then I'm ready to eat a horse.<br>  <br>  People who see colors will see all kinds of mists and colors as well.<br>  <br>  Enjoy it and play with it. Seek out others who share an interest in Reiki and healing. Consider studying other valuable approaches.

gNBO8M71aa	Look up Keratosis Pilaris.. see if it looks familiar. It's VERY common. I've had it since I was nine.. I'm 27 now. Or it could possibly be folliculitis. Without more of a description of symptoms, it's hard to say. But the two ideas I listed above are probably the most likely.
7ajz1w2Raa	It will kill all bacteria, viruses, and other organisms that could be in the water.  It will not get rid of any chemicals though.|`|lEX3CjWlaa	It will kill most all harmful bacteria and other things that could make you sick. Some organisms may survive but would not affect you. <br>  <br>  Though recommended boiling times vary, I've alway used 1-2 minutes.<br>  <br>  Try this website:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.survivaltopics.com/survival/how-long-do-you-need-to-boil-water/" rel="nofollow">http://www.survivaltopics.com/survival/h...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this Helps|`|v0596BTeaa	Yes, boiled water is fairly sterile.  However, in most countries, water is chlorinated and is perfectly safe for adults to drink straight from the tap.  You may want to boil and cool it for babies, or for medical purposes, e.g. bathing wounds.

Go listen to some music, or go workout (I hate working out, but when I'm angry or depressed it works -so- well!).<br>  <br>  I'm under a lot of stress lately being a pharmacy major at college, so working out helps a lot (except when you're sick... that's usually a bad idea).|`|inA6ZLeAaa	As a parent, I know for a fact- your Dad is not hating you. He may be a little upset with you, But we parents love our kids with all our heart and more. You are too young to take all this so personally.

Pray to God that everything will get better, He works miracles everyday, join a youth group and you will get awesome support.

ZuYTZ80Gaa	This is fine, the chemical structure and action of cephalexin is very similar to amoxil.   <br>  <br>  With any antibiotic, some medications may not work as well (i.e the birth control pill).  There is also a chance of antibiotic associated diarrhea, and if you start having terrible diarrhea see your physician immediately.

So unless you can deal with the consequences of unprotected sex, you should continue to use a condom.<br>  Even with both there is a possibility of becoming pregnant. Nothing is for certain, so it really doesn't hurt to double up on protection|`|nLXfeQbpaa	yes! my mom had all three  children on the pill. <br>  it is not effective what so ever even if you take it perfectly. <br>  try something called Depo Provera. <br>  Its a once every three month shot.

It won't hurt.|`|AA11599407	No, they are not.|`|4d609fcce5f5f73d048fa387f7f37eacaa	It depends on your level of comfort in taking risks. The pill is about 95% effective. Using another form of birth control would lower this risk even more.
uVMlNvLoaa	If you insert them right, which is fairly easy to do, they do not hurt, and you can't even feel them! I love tampons and they make my life considerably more comfortable.<br>  <br>  Start out with the lower-absorbency ones (they're smaller and more easy to experiment with), and then as you get comfortable with it you can up the absorbency. Make sure you get ones like Playtex or Tampax that have plastic applicators--you don't want ones without applicators (very very awkward to put in).<br>  <br>  Don't worry about them getting stuck, or being lost in your vagina--they're no where they can go, and they're very sturdy and can withstand a lot of pulling!|`|tGcNmDUZaa	I am 14 and tried tampons from my first cycle 6 months ago, I didn't have much luck with applicator they'd go in funnily and I could always feel them, but when I tried OB tampons without applicators, they worked great. I use Boots own brand because I find they are even better than Tampax! They didn't hurt me at all, I think as long as you are gentle and don't force it in it shouldn't hurt at all. Give it a try if you like, make sure you read the instructions though. Good luck!|`|pC1H7kO4aa	I was a little freaked about using them the first time, but then when I did it I was so happy because pads are ridiculously annoying!<br>  But no, tampons don't hurt at all. You might feel some discomfort if you put it in wrong, but that can easily be fixed. :]<br>  Trust me, they'll be your best friend!|`|CqldGgFCaa	no they dont hurt at all<br>  <br>  heres the instructions<br>  <br>  ok<br>  you open the package<br>  you hold the tampon<br>  you push the first part of the tampon up your vagina<br>  push up the first tube until your fingers are touching your skin<br>  then push the second tube into the first tube<br>  then pull out both tubes<br>  keep the tampon in for 4-6 hours <br>  if you feel any discomfort remove it and try again<br>  to remove relax your muscles as much as possible then slowly and gently pull the string out <br>  :) hope i helped if you need more help look at the directions there are pics there :)|`|0b719092b4d69772e046d90f96e26879aa	Once you get used to putting them in, it doesn't hurt. The first time can be a bit painful, as you are not used to the angle. The instructions are in the box. You just have to position it at a 45 degree angle (pointing towards your lower back), gently push it in, and remove the plastic (or carboard) applicator :)<br>  <br>  xoxLina|`|aDSuIzuoaa	no not at all. at first its discomforting because you are thinking about putting it in and stuff. but after its fine!!  you wont even feel it!|`|NRzBs8Noaa	Get thinner pads because tampons can hurt.

LljdBOUCaa	Hi im sorry to hear that your daughter has cancer<br>  i know how it feels to know someone who has cancer its really stressful and painful my husband had cancer before he died (he didnt die from cancer ) well what i would do is go up to the school and say i dont care what ur thinking about what ur doing later i want u to do it now or i will sue the school i dont want my child to be bullied and all schools are ment to be bullying free so if they dont stop it u could sue  them|`|qkuMPSczaa	i'm so sorry. let her know that there are other kids like her in the world. Also, when I was in elementary school they made us watch a video about kids with autism so maybe you could suggest to the school about learning about cancer and how it effects many people and also how it's uncontrollable. Oh yeah, consequences aren't oing to help much. Making the kids learn abou how bad cancer really is should make them realize what they had done wrong. The, they will tart to be friends with your daughter. Hope this helped.|`|WdzACevnaa	Children are very mean at that age. There really is nothing you can do except encourage her to not be like them. Most children grow out of this phase and you can only hope it happens fast|`|Z5AvRGQfaa	I'm so sorry thats really sad.Maybe if it's at school you can talk to her principal and\or teacher.Just because she has cancer doesn't mean she has to be picked on.Good luck.|`|6C5NDSBSaa	How awful. Kids can be so cruel. <br>  The only thing I can think of is maybe...have you discussed how she would feel about being homeschooled?|`|WX7pUlepaa	i am soooo sorry, kids can be really mean.<br>  <br>  i have tourettes and i get picked on all the time, i remember on day in class were were talking about a war and my teacher said " because of the conditions they had tics and fleas" and this kid looks at me and says " so pretty much they were dogs" and anyone who knows what tourettes is knows that its a mixture of tics and all of my class knew that so i know he just said that too be rude.<br>  honestly nothing the school or you tell them will stop them from picking on her, im homecoming queen and i still get picked on for my tourettes.<br>  but what you can do is make her feel more comftorable,get her into a sport, or take her to a place where other kids have cancer so she dosnt think shes the only one.<br>  <br>  hope this helps(:|`|wUMc0hqDaa	Wow, reading this truly touched my heart and even kinda brought tears to my eyes. i am sorry to say that there are some people who don't have compassion and doesn't seem to understand individuals situations unless they are in these situations themselves. what i can suggest to cheer her up is to always let her know that you are there for her and that she has nothing to be ashamed of and that some people are just cruel and itll take time. ALso always let her know that you love and care for her and that there is always someone she can turn to.|`|gIMZaY02aa	I think K-Lo is on the right track with suggesting homeschooling.  It might seem opposite to what she wants(real friendships), but I know how traumatizing bullying can be, and I can only imagine it is amplified by her issues with cancer.<br>  <br>  Definitely look into teaching her yourself at home.|`|wwi7SKVpaa	That is SUCH a sad story. What I would do is tell your daughter that she is the most beautiful girl in the world and that the kids that are picking on her are the ones that are ugly. Maybe you should talk to the parents too.|`|PTsuqdJhaa	OMG i am so sorry to hear that about your little girl, and you are right it isnt fair!  You should have a talk with the LAUSD about it.  Try to convince them that maybe educating the children about cancer will help.  It may be tough but pictures definitely will help.  Children shouldn't be doing that and there definitely should be consequences, which i wouldn't think they are giving because it is still going on.  If it is a specific child i would recommend talking to the childs parent(s) about it. Also I am sure she will find a friend soon.  Many kids can be very cruel and I know your little girl doesn't deserve it.  I am really truly sorry that your little girl has to go through that and i do wish and pray that they will stop.  good luck! and I hope you can find the best ways to take care of it :) just don't give up hope!

SCeIOtZpaa	Spiders can bite at night and you aren't always aware of it until you have a mysterious bump or a red bite mark.  I would go to a walk in clinic, urgent care, or see your family doctor asap just to get it checked out.  If it is a spider bite, some spiders have powerful venom and you will want to get it taken care of as early as you can.
PTsuqdJhaa	the first time i had my period, when i saw the blood i started crying.  It wasnt because i was bleeding, and i wasnt cramping, I was just overemotional.

Unfortunately there isn't much else you can really do and by them finding out it could actually do you a lot of good. Why do you feel the need to cut anyway? Hopefully this will show you that you shouldn't do it anymore. I know life is very tough but you can't physically take it out on yourself; have you tried getting therapy? Talking to people will let all of your negative feelings out in the open and will give you the starting point to coping with your problems in the future. If the cutting is on one of your arms only then pull up your other sleeve for them indicating that you want them to do it there, but ultimately you have to get help and if they find out about it things will only get better from there.|`|3oswni4Vaa	well firstly i wouldn't cut yourself so you can avoid these problems.<br>  but don't panic, just act normal and if asked about them, say you picked up a cat that began scratching you a lot|`|mIWrf609aa	ok, here's what you do, go to this website:<br>  www.helpimanemofag.com/wrist|`|SaJ0kQOTaa	Cut more so they look accidental and say you fell off your bike or something. <br>  Or actually fall off your bike.|`|AjU48L5Xaa	Put makeup on it is the only suggestion I could give.|`|xeHMCisXaa	Be sick tomorrow and skip the shot is what I would do.<br>  <br>  Tetanus shots are just shots that if you ever stepped on a rusty nail or something, that it doesn't kill you from the rusty particles in your blood stream into your heart.<br>  <br>  If you are not really around that type of environment getting cut my rusty object or such, what is the real point of needing that shot?<br>  <br>  Tetanus shots are every 2-4 years I believe.

It's easy to get embarrassed and then not find out what you need to know!<br>  <br>  As for ways to do it, you have several options:<br>  <br>  1. Fingers. They're the old standby, and they work. Focus on your clit--experiment with different speeds and pressures. Start by rubbing lying on your back, and then try lying on your stomach and grinding your hips to rub against your fingers. Experiment, and know this is how most women try it for the first time!<br>  <br>  2. Showerhead/bath faucet. A favorite of many girls. If you have a detachable showerhead, simply adjust the water temperature, lie down in the tub, point it at your clit, and enjoy! Note that the lying down part is important, especially if you're new to this--don't want to slip!<br>  <br>  3. Vibrator. No, you can't go out and buy one at your age from a sex shop. However, take a look at those "Face massagers" and "Back massagers" at Wal-Mart--believe me, they will do the trick. Again, focus on your clit (are you catching the theme here?).<br>  <br>  Above all else, have fun!|`|w7d2H3vzaa	hmmmm|`|H0oylQOwaa	well u can just rub urself down there|`|E76r5xSxaa	It's probably nervousness.

5843355184faeff731f1a94bbecb55e4aa	If your OB/GYN had thought that the bruise was related to a burst blood vessle and if it was felt this was consistent with your symptoms, I would seek the opinion of a vascular surgeon.  <br>  <br>  A neurologist would be appropriate if there was thought of some type of nerve compression.  <br>  <br>  It's unusual to have numbness localized to such a small spot on your knee.  Numbness can commonly occur in the outer boarder of the foot and is often associated with low back pain, but just above the knee is a little unusual for a neurological problem (unless it was the whole front of the thigh).  <br>  <br>  Sounds unusual, either way.|`|WqkOI7RDaa	You have a circulation problem.

As hookah smoking is also actively marketed very much faster than cigarettes, when comparing with cigarette smoking, hookah smoking also equally dangerous, which may lead to lung cancer. <br>  <br>  The belief of the experts is that regardless of inhaling any amount of tobacco smoke the origin will lead to lung cancer. <br>  <br>  so in technical terms you are still in the possible 87% chance of getting lung caner.

Also yams/sweet potatoes.<br>  <br>  <br>  In more serious casesAbdominal pain is caused by inflammation (for example, appendicitis, diverticulitis, colitis ), by stretching or distention of an organ (for example, obstruction of the intestine, blockage of a bile duct by gallstones, swelling of the liver with hepatitis), or by loss of the supply of blood to an organ (for example, ischemic colitis).<br>  <br>  To complicate matters, however, abdominal pain also can occur without inflammation, distention or loss of blood supply. An important example of this latter type of pain is the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). It is not clear what causes the abdominal pain in IBS, but it is believed to be due either to abnormal contractions of the intestinal muscles (for example, spasm) or abnormally sensitive nerves within the intestines that give rise to painful sensations inappropriately (visceral hyper-sensitivity). These latter types of pain are often referred to as functional pain because no recognizable (visible) causes for the pain have been found - at least not yet.

I didnt start my period till i was 14 and at tht point my boobs were AA they stil were an A wen i was like 19 but now im 22 and they are a DD!!!! so b patient!|`|tL73W0VZaa	Yes, they're going to grow. Since you're thirteen, and you got your period last month, you'll probably see quite a change in size within the next six months.|`|m5gJKkLcaa	They should do I guess....|`|OR8hrr0aaa	lol you have another 5 years of growing dear :)|`|D3As94Dnaa	Of course they will, it may take 1-2 years or even a few months. If all your friends all have bigger breasts then don't worry everybody changes. I am only 13 and I have pretty big breasts (Not trying to make you feel down) but my mother has huge breasts and she developed at 16 so I think you should wait. If you would like to make them "appear" bigger just go to a shop that sells bras and ask for some chicken fillets. Just wait a few more years.|`|4d609fcce5f5f73d048fa387f7f37eacaa	They will probably continue to grow throughout your lifetime, based on your weight, pregnancies, etc.<br>  <br>  When I was your age I probably wore an A or B. Now at 34 I wear a D. When I was pregnant I wore an E! :)<br>  <br>  It will also depend your genetics, so look to your mom and grandma for what the future may hold.|`|bJqVZqseaa	I am 19 and my boobs are a 34AA aswell :( <br>  I would get a boob op but will never have the money, i suppose you have to enjoy your body and love it for how it is.|`|acvtjdHBaa	Yes they will grow, compared to how large your mom's or grandmother's breasts were, that's how large your breasts are probably gonna get, I'm only 16 and my bra size is bigger than my mom's!|`|stsSDAwJaa	You are only thirteen okay? So just relax. Sometimes breasts can grow as late as 22 years old. Don't worry, you have plenty of time to grow boobs. Trust me.|`|N8cAwzxzaa	Yes, they'll keep growing until you're at least 17. Mine stopped growing around then, but then I put a bit of weight on so they got bigger with regards to that. At 13 your body has only just begun to change.|`|mBbwqo0uaa	apparently bodies actually don't stop properly growing up until your 21, so you got plenty time (y)|`|qTqjlHDtaa	yeah since you started your period they might even grow a bit faster.:] they will keep growing until your 18 =]|`|LwJHPcesaa	As you have just started your period, this means that your body has properly started to develop now. So just be patient and they should start to grow quicker now.|`|LMMzmeWfaa	When i got my 1st period i was an AA aswell dont worry im nw a B and hopefully still growin:))

UlsHRSH5aa	I don't know anyone without a thumb, but I have several acquaintances that have lost or damaged fingers.  The key to doing well is to carefully and rigorously follow the physical therapy plan you are given.  It is crucial to keep the tendons and muscles limber while they heal from this.<br>  <br>  As for the toe implant, I imagine that's a decision you can make later.  You might want to talk to some people (yahoo is a good place to start, but I will bet there's a discussion group that discusses just this topic on line somewhere) who made the decision both yes and no to see what their thoughts are down the road.  <br>  <br>  Talk to your doctors about how your age influences their recommendation.  Is your hand or foot likely to suffer down the road when you have so very many years left to use them?<br>  <br>  You are not alone in thinking that this tumor was nothing - its often diagnosed late because that's what most people think.  But your experience is one of the reasons why people should see their doctor when something unusual is going on with their body that lasts for more than a few weeks.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you as you decide what the right course of treatment is for you.
AA11020187	You are not being clear. Is this happening during your period or has it be ongoing for 2-3 months straight? This is not a symptom of either cancer, but if it has been ongoing you need to get to a doctor or hospital ASAP regardless of the cause.|`|34d2e55662fa047f84fc8828a81ce35faa	Not to be rude but it's just the normal for some people with having your period. Some people bleed heavy and some don't the clots that are coming out is just the protective layer of your stomach lining that your body builds up every month in preparation for a possible pregnancy. When you don't become pregnant the body will start shedding the old lining and prepare for the next one hence the clots. The bad pains are cramps due to pms. Unless there is high family history of cancer I wouldn't worry about it. It doesn't sound like cancer to me just a bad period. You can get an over the counter pill called Midol and it will help take the pain and other symptoms of pms away while you are going thru your period. I hope this has helped and God Bless!|`|0w1f6Dh1aa	I have to disagree with the poster who said that heavy bleeding is not a symptom of either cancer - it most certainly is a symptom of cervical cancer! I speak from experience - heavy bleeding was the reason my Stage 2B cervical cancer was diagnosed.<br>  <br>  If you are bleeding heavily during your regular menstrual cycle it's probably nothing but a heavy period. But if you are bleeding heavily in between or when you don't expect to be, see your doctor! Now!|`|AA11075313	I dont think so but plz consult your physician as soon as possibly, do not wait so long  this is for your own best<br>  good luck

XTqpWDXPaa	First, smoking weed really isn't as bad as all of the anti-pot commercials tell you, and they are all pretty much propaganda.  So, you really don't "need" to do anything.  But if you feel like you should, talk to her in private(1 on 1).  Don't attack her, because that will only cause her to become defensive and you won't get anywhere.  Just ask her simple questions about *weed*(not her smoking weed) and get a dialogue started, the rest should come naturally.  And remember it's very important not to attack her.<br>  <br>  P.S.<br>  It sounds like you have never smoked before; and its a great way to bond with people.  If you aren't too opposed, try it with her sometime.  You might find out that it isn't that bad!!|`|PVe6jK78aa	I ask if i can buy a dime bag. Its marijuana not an actual drug. I'd be concerned if they were doing something bad but don't push your feelings onto someone and lets them do their thing.|`|UReU5V9Faa	Ask to join inn|`|YTXoBgVsaa	If she is doing it alone- just ask her whats going on. Don't do it infront of your friends but maybe pull her aside and privately ask if everyrthing is okay because she isn't acting like she usually does. <br>  <br>  If she is smoking up with others it may be a question of peer pressure, just ask her to hang out. The more she sees herself being close to you, the less she'll be with her other friends, the less weed she'll smoke.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|1NSPKg1baa	Weed is not that bad for you. But first I should ask: How old are you? And what state do you live in? And how much and often is she smoking?<br>  <br>  If you are younger than 16, I would say that you don't need to be smoking. And depending on the state you live in, you could be facing serious charges. Some states will put you in jail for having just a tiny tiny tiny amount on you! I'm not kidding, it happened to me, in Tennessee. Now I live in NYC and they just write you a ticket, just like a parking ticket. It doesn't go on your record or anything. Check www.norml.org for the state-by-state laws.<br>  <br>  If she has no friends except for you and your friends, where is she getting this weed? And who is she smoking it with?  alone?<br>  <br>  DO NOT tell her parents or anything like that. Just talk to her. Try to find out what's going on with her. Maybe she's depressed. Maybe she is just having fun...<br>  <br>  Do some research on weed (and not at government sites) and see how you really feel. When I was a kid, I thought that like...weed and crack were the same, thanks to my schools anti-drug programs. It's not like that. <br>  <br>  Just talk to her. Tell her how you feel. Good luck.

I8fAJ1Bdaa	Poppy tea is a rather good legal painkiller.|`|exMPHWKHaa	Well theres a couple things but I do not believe they are for pain. There is Salvia which is a very strong psychedelic similar to LSD and you can buy it at any smoke shop. Its illegal in some states though check your laws. It is legal to buy LSA in the form that it came in like the morning glory seeds. You just can't extract it. There is Nutmeg which is a weird trippy drug. You could try getting nitrous oxide from whip cream cans but again thats not for pain. Sorry bro can't help you out if your looking for something to help with the pain I just recommend smoking marijuana as this really helps with pain. this of course is illegal though. Well there is opium tea which you can extract from poppy pods. But this is heavily dangerous and a lot of people die this way you have to know what your doing. look it up on erowid.org EDIT: Yes I realize salvia is a stronger psychedelic but it does have LSD quality's. An example would be its visuals.|`|IMvg8zajaa	nope, sorry|`|2lx4cgYPaa	you can make poppy seed tea, which is kind of dangerous.<br>  you can also make your own alcohol<br>  AND do not listen to the guy who said salvia is anything like LSD salvia is extremely strong in comparison, yes it is legal because it only lasts a few minutes.

Uy90ml9Saa	Diabetes actually isn't anything to do with a defect in insulin. It has to do with two things, the pancreas, and the body's resistance to insulin.<br>  <br>  Type 1 diabetes, or typically referred to as juvenile diabetes deals specifically with defects in the pancreas, for some reason it isn't making enough insulin, is withering away, (autosomal destrucion) or for some reason it can't keep up with the bodily needs to counteract the hormone glucagon. Which causes the weight loss, and many symptoms children or generally slender people have with type 1 diabetes.<br>  <br>  Type 2 diabetes is more related to body mass and is referred to as adult type diabetes. While there is some genetic tendency to have type 2, it is more of a result of diet and being obese. When an individual consumes large amounts of sugars on a regular basis, and is also obese, over the years they may become resistant to the hormone insulin because the body has had to constant churn it out for years. This resistance causes many diabetes symptoms, such as limb loss, loss of sight, heart attack etc from the elevated amounts of sugar in the blood stream.<br>  <br>  In either case insulin isn't defective, it deals with either the pancreas or the body's natural resistance to insulin.|`|ULbkPIGdaa	Diabetes develops due to a diminished production of insulin (in type 1) or resistance to its effects (in type 2 and gestational). Both lead to hyperglycemia.|`|bLgVcTZKaa	both forms of diabetes mellitus do.there is no defect in the quality of insulin as such,but the quantity(diabetes mellitus type 1) of it and the body's ability to utilize it(diabetes mellitus type 2)<br>  <br>  diabetes insipidus on the other hand has to do with a deficiency of or insensitivity to anti-diuretic hormone(vasopressin)

nLXfeQbpaa	Yes it would because your body isn't strong enough to support a baby and your body knows that. <br>  So it really could be delayed because of that.

uVMlNvLoaa	It's okay to douche at anytime during your cycle, technically, but I would highly advise against it. Douching messes with the pH of your vagina and increases your likelihood of yeast infections and UTI's.<br>  <br>  Leave the cleaning job to your vagina--it knows what it's doing.|`|8EHYNBNtaa	There's really no point to douche while on your period, you're still going to be bleeding.

I've dealt with the same type of issues.  Sometimes I think that I look great and sometimes I think I look fat and awful.  I am overweight but I don't let it stop me.  You should appreciate yourself for the person you are and the way that you look.  The truth is you are probably somewhere between ugly and handsome.  But don't even look at it that way.  Looks aren't everything.  Find a solution.  I know people who shave their heads bald on purpose.  Go with it.  Work with what you got.|`|7AxSbpvsaa	There is nothing you can do about it.

xNBFsEnsaa	I believe it's a little bit of both. You want someone who is like her because you were actually in love with her. I believe you should just tell her how you feel instead of trying to find someone who is exactly like her.

I think your heart is telling you to stop denying the fact that you still have the feelings for her. I think you need to wait a while, to actually do anything. I know it's gonna be hard, but if you do something at the wrong time everything will just get worse. But for now, I suggest that each time she talks to you, take the effort and talk to her back like you always do. I think that you just need to be friends for now and slowly let her know your feelings piece by piece. Just become one of her friends, then one of her closest friends. And when something goes on in her life, go and save her.|`|QpP9kMAMaa	It sounds as if you are feeling less of yourself & it's coming out in your dreams. Is it that maybe you need an outside interest or that maybe it is time that you go on a date or two?|`|Phr0pahEaa	you left her for a reason just think about that.|`|89eff262f6bea247dc65af0dfdb2e666aa	You love(d) her because you thought she was the most incredible person you'd ever met. You're having nightmares because you want them to become dreams again. The reason you haven't found someone interesting is because subconsciously your comparing them to her, the thing is you're only comparing her good traits to the other. You don't take into account the bad traits that she has. I can bet that the break up was more of her idea, and being the nice person you are reluctantly agreed. You're not crazy nor lonely. This is just a withdrawal, more than likely you're having these dreams because your brain(you) just want to go back to how things were. All fine and dandy, but the truth of the matter is that they won't be again. Things change, this is just how life works. <br>  <br>  My advice is that you don't pursue her anymore, keep dating other girls, if you feel like you didn't really connect with the person on the first date ask for another but do something YOU like, if she seems contempt by what you like then that's a good sign and a new branch of life on your relationship tree.    <br>  Life is a trial and error kinda thing. Gotta keep at it.
q1Q8JcCEaa	I had pinworms this past fall and the doctor said the same thing to us. The medicine is chewable and is a little chalky and I stopped seeing the worms after the first day. I think that the worms dissolve because I didn't see them in my feces anymore.
xCSZ3M3Raa	I ws just told I have 10% total disability and permanent restrictions also. Tuesday I am going for an independant medical exam that I have requested from the work comp board, because the original work comp doctors said there was nothing more they could do. Have you requested an IME from work comp?  If you haven't you should try that first.
bsuOclQMaa	I sometimes get sick when im on my period. I can get anything from  a fever to hardcore throwing up all while having intense cramps! I've been to the doctor for it, its normal, but you should get it checked out, whats normal for me may not be for you.|`|6Btmg7Tcaa	It used to happen to me, it started for me within the first year of me starting. I would get terrible cramps, start my period, throw up for two days, then sleep for another two days, it was insane. <br>  It was only when I threw up in school and they bawled my Mum out about it she took me to the doc. They tried me on various tablets but eventually put me on the pill, I was only 12 at the time but it did work. <br>  <br>  Go see the doc to see if he/she can give you anything, i would only recommend the pill as the very last option though. But if your anything like me and leave this, it'll happen every month|`|kAIxH7w6aa	I feel dizzy and experience some of that during my period too.<br>  <br>  I would however check out with a doctor, better safe than sorry!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|OqjxyYxqaa	You are sick. Go see a doctor
ESd9hk21aa	Size doesn't really matter, what matters is how you work it and how you move lol. Seriously, if you know what you're doing, size doesn't matter.

GIwnLv8Vaa	I developed a bulging disc between lumbar 4 and 5 by running too much on the jogging trail. I'll tell you what I did. You'll have to decide what is applicable in your case.<br>  <br>  1) Aleve is a good Non-steroidal medication that is sold over the counter.The doctor can prescribe a stronger form of the drug in the name Naproxen.The doctor can also prescribe Tramadol which is a narcotic and good pain reliever if it gets really bad.<br>  Back ice packs are a good idea also.Usually they can be placed around the waist area for the best relief.<br>   (They connect with velcro) You can buy them at most pharmacies<br>   -- example at the site below:<br>  <a href="http://www.shapeupshop.com/fitness/recovery/ice_heat_wrap.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.shapeupshop.com/fitness/recov...</a><br>  <br>  2) The lunge exercise is good for sciatic conditions.<br>   An example is at the bottom of this site:<br>  <a href="http://www.halhigdon.com/15Ktraining/Strength.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.halhigdon.com/15Ktraining/Str...</a><br>  <br>  The spine-health site gives good info too:<br>  <a href="http://www.spine-health.com/conditions/sciatica/sciatica-first-aid" rel="nofollow">http://www.spine-health.com/conditions/s...</a>|`|YvuCN6qWaa	Oh man.. I'm sorry.. I was 13 when I had sciatica in my right leg .. I was pretty much a cripple haha I couldn't walk or do anything. Well, I'm sorry to tell you you cannot get rid of the pain permanently because sciatica happens because of a back problem or something related to that nature. You can take ibuprofen (aka motrin) to help relieve the pain but that only lasts for 7 hours or so. Other than that you should see a doctor and get x-rays of your back and see what's wrong. Then maybe you could ask what could be done after that. Good luck :)
QJHE3z1raa	means its either your period or it will start soon|`|YMbaFWA2aa	It just mean your period is really close to come.<br>  Brown discharge is dried up blood that's why its  little red .<br>  Put a pad on trust me.|`|yXJWYTWfaa	maybe its something to do with your diet, like your eating a specific food regularly or lacking a nutrient in something else e.g. iron. <br>  if you suffer from an eating disorder than that might be related;<br>  or maybe you've got a bun in the oven. ;) (your pregnant.)<br>  <br>  if your discharge continues to carry on like that, <br>  then i would consult to your doctor, and have a check.

If there is, (depending on how serious) you can go to the ER to have them clean it out & bandage it, or you can wash it out really well on your own. Then just keep applying Neosporin or Polysporin to the wound and put a bandaid on it until it heals over, or until a hard scab forms.|`|xO1LQWbZaa	Rub an alchol pad on the cut or peroxide three times a day and dress it with a steral dressing every time your clean it.

EHQCkDaqaa	depends on where you are getting it done. if you mean in the lobe part of your ears, no. What hurts more is the next few hours, your ears getting used to the post. The gun that they use to pierce your ears is scary, but isn't bad. If you are getting cartilage or something pierced, then yes, that does hurt.. Make sure that you go to a tattoo parlor or something instead of a "Claire's" type store. If they don't do it correctly, they will just break the cartilage instead of poking a hole in it, which won't heal correctly, and you'll have to take it out anyway.|`|xmibEEdcaa	If you get it done by a professional, then it won't hurt at all.  They have a kind of "gun" they use and it's remarkably painless. There will be a little pinching sensation and a loud noise, and it will be done.<br>  <br>  The trick is keeping it really clean afterwards, so it doesn't get infected. Practice good hygiene with the piercing (and I do mean *good* - be anal retentive about it), and you shouldn't have any pain.|`|aUd5Dnbraa	Not too bad, hardly hurt at all except when you get your cartilage done.<br>  Hurts even less to get your lip pierced though.|`|RW566BSUaa	To the first person who answered.

xmibEEdcaa	Oh God, Guitar Hero! That game totally killed my hands, too. Especially my pinky finger and wrists. Ow.<br>  <br>  Take a couple of pain killers and give the game a rest for a few days. Rubbing some Ben Gay into my wrists helped me, but don't do that if you're sensitive to methyl salicylate. They'll feel better tomorrow.  The hard part will be staying away from the game for a while.  That thing's addictive!<br>  <br>  When you do go back to the game, see if you can find a way to hold the guitar neck that doesn't strain your hand quite so much.  Be aware of how tense your left hand is getting, and try to consciously relax it a bit. Also, play in shorter sessions. No more marathons.<br>  <br>  ETA: Heh.

iK3YYRaTaa	Treatment for Diabetes<br>  Successful treatment makes all the difference to long-term health, and achieving balanced diabetes treatment can be the key to living with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Treatment varies for each individual, not simply on the type of diabetes that they have, but also more individual-specific diabetic treatment differences.<br>  <br>  When treating diabetes, management strategies should be planned along with a qualified health care team. Never make changes to treatment schedule or management routine without consulting a medical professional, no matter what advice you are given elsewhere. <br>  <br>  The following information on treatments for diabetes is from the National Diabetes Fact Sheet: National estimates and general information on diabetes in the United States (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Atlanta , GA : US Department of Health and Human Services, 1997):<br>  <br>  "Diabetes knowledge, treatment, and prevention strategies advance daily. Treatment is aimed at keeping blood glucose near normal levels at all times. Training in self-management is integral to the treatment of diabetes. Treatment must be individualized and must address medical, psychosocial, and lifestyle issues." <br>  <br>  A variety of different factors have a role to play in treating diabetes, but the importance of balanced, co-ordinated diabetes treatment for all diabetics cannot be underestimated. Regular and successful treatment decreases the risk of each patient developing diabetes complications. The basics of diabetes treatment are broken down into each diabetic type below. <br>  <br>  Treatment of Type 1 diabetes<br>  Type 1 diabetes treatment is a daily task. Lack of insulin production by the pancreas makes Type 1 diabetes is particularly difficult to control. Treatment requires a strict regimen that typically includes a carefully calculated diet, planned physical activity, home blood glucose testing several times a day, and multiple daily insulin injections. <br>  <br>  Treatment of Type 2 diabetes<br>  Treatment typically includes diet control, exercise, home blood glucose testing, and in some cases, oral medication and/or insulin. Approximately 40% of people with type 2 diabetes require insulin injections.<br>  <br>  Good luck>|`|BhFeii5Xaa	<a href="http://www.phlaunt.com/diabetes/" rel="nofollow">http://www.phlaunt.com/diabetes/</a><br>  <br>  There is a lot to read on that site.<br>  <br>  Most diabetes is treated with medications: antidiabetes oral medications and/or injections.<br>  <br>  It is also treated witht herapy in the form of more exercise - movement, and with dietary changes.

k6bUrwcKaa	Well, if your period has been irregular like you said until age 14-15, then it could be that. Also, there are some STDs out there that can mess up your period, so if you are having oral sex, then you should get checked out by a doctor. If no semen had any way of getting into your vagina, either by sex, or having a guy finger you with it on his finger, or getting it on your hands and touching yourself down there, you're not pregnant. If you are worried about being pregnant though, take a test. I would still advise going to get checked out or ask your partner(s) if he/she has had sexual relationships with anybody besides yourself. If so, you might want to get checked out for that. Hope I helped. Good luck :)|`|0b719092b4d69772e046d90f96e26879aa	I would visit the doctor. It is possible that you are pregnant. Take a pregnancy test and go to the dotor's to get tested for STDs.

The discs that sit between the vertebra, act as nice soft cushions, dehydrate as we age. It starts at the age of 25/30 and continues until we are 60/65, whereupon the discs are no more. You do not state your age? Anyway you cannot rebuild this, unless you can stop the aging process and we cannot. Best of Luck|`|YvuCN6qWaa	You can really fix it - it's a permanent thing. All I have to tell you is to drink more water than others usually have to (10-12 cups instead of 8) to hydrate the discs. Also, I have this medicine called Glucosamine - it says on the bottle that it constructs cartilage to promote mobility and flexibility. You can Google it. I have two disc herniations and I was told to drink two pills daily by my chiropractor so yeah.. Hope I helped!|`|2c9c1875416bc3d1d977b4f658279178aa	There is no proven way to regenerate cartilage.  If it does not repair/regenerate on it's own, no supplement or addition to your diet will help it along.  Some people swear by certain supplements like glucosamine, shark cartilage, or gelatin.  While they may relieve some of the symptoms and keep your spine a little more mobile and pain-free, there is no evidence to support their use for cartilage regeneration.  If you're interested in trying supplements/diet changes, type in a search for something like "rebuild cartilage" and you'll get lots of results...or check with a nutritionist, or a store like gnc for some ideas.<br>  I know how painful that can be...good luck.|`|VQlXF8Ucaa	You don't overcome a degeneration problem.  You can take Glucosamine/Chondroitin supplements and those do help.  Also talk to your doctor about giving you some pain medicine.

sQu3LLqtaa	About the only sugar that you can give up is table sugar, honey and high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) and sweet foods loaded with such sugars.  HFCS is a common preservative that is often added to foods but these preservatives are usually identified by numerals only so you don't really know what those numerals are concealing.<br>  <br>  Natural sugars occur in all carbohydrate foods or they are formed when complex carbohydrates are broken down and they are OK.  A lot of processed foods contain added sugar and it is very difficult to live without such common every day foods such as bread and cereals and many others.<br>  <br>  If you want 146 incentives to steer clear of sugar you can see the list in <a href="http://www.rheumatic.org/sugar.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rheumatic.org/sugar.htm</a> .|`|5esm3e1Baa	Dependent on your current sugar intake, you will need to replace refined sugars with unrefined sugars, as your body may experience mild shock if you simply stop eating sugar altogether.  It is not a question of willpower, as sugar is not a drug, but rather it is a necessary component of a balanced diet.  <br>  <br>  Give up something else instead, like texting or television.|`|cbp7Gukbaa	If you completely give it up your just torturing yourself,just lower the intake.Drink soda but dont drink it every day|`|8x0oe23aaa	let me think if didn't have sugar*dies*that's answer's your question i hope.|`|zhk8o514aa	Life without sugar...please bury me.|`|ZRgkgJeDaa	i dd not give up sugar completely but  approx 20years ago there was a sugar shortage( give or take 5 years) it was around lent and i tried to give it up for lent i ended up cutting sugar down from 2 1/2 sugars in tea and coffee to 1 it tasted like crap , but only for a few days, now having more than a level spoon in tea or coffee is like drinking syrup. it is not to hard if you really want to do it|`|GsV67vUNaa	About 10 years ago (I was 16) I got told I was clinically type-2 diabetic, and since then I've given up sugar. So much so, that I managed to reverse the onset of diabetes, and now I live a healthier life!|`|UlhKFXneaa	Have given it up completely, and don't miss it at all.<br>  <br>  Best way to give up is to put a tiny bit less in your cup each day, until it's not worth putting any in at all.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|tVF9O1Olaa	I think giving up all sugar is a bit much as there is sugar is many foods, foods you may not realise have sugar in! Why not give up soda, chocolate etc instead of saying sugar?<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT-there is sugar in things like bread and yoghurt etc they are not junk food and yes i eat these alot. I don't think you are giving up the wrong thing, i just think you should think more about it as sugar is in a lot of things. Its your choice but i think you will be limited on the things you can eat! Even fruit has natural sugar in!!

If you do one of the apheresis procedures, they will take your blood through the tube into this machine that separates the red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and plasma.  Then they take one of those components, say if you're donating plasma they'll store that and return the rest of the blood back into your body though another tube.  It doesn't really *purify* the blood, if that's what you're thinking, but I'm guessing that this blood purifying procedure you're talking about has a similar process of taking blood out, modifying it, then returning it back?  <br>  <br>  No, donating blood is just donating blood, and they don't do anything to enhance your blood when it's returned if you're having the apheresis done.

Jelq and penis exercises take some time to see the result.  You can read more on my blog<br>  <br>  natural-penis-enlargement-secret.blogs...|`|GB1f4sEEaa	Stretching will increase the size of the erect penis but takes a commitment for any noticable effects. I would suggest going to google and search "penis stretching".|`|ZkwtldYlaa	You should be happy with what you have.<br>  <br>  However if you really feel the need to increase your penis size,then you should try out these :<br>  <br>  Here are four good natural penis enhancement techniques I recommend for rookies. Done properly and consistently, they should add close to an inch or two to your penis in six weeks.<br>  <br>  1. Penis stretches. This one is very simple. Just take your flaccid penis and stretch it as far out in front of your body as it will go. Do it gently and gradually and hold it there for thirty seconds. Rest ten seconds between sets and repeat this at least ten times.<br>  <br>  2. Jelqing. This is another great technique for rookies. Get your penis halfway erect, apply lubrication, and grip it tightly at the base with the thumb and forefinger of one hand. Slowly slide that hand up the shaft toward the tip, pushing as much blood into your penis as possible. When you reach the tip, immediately grip the base the same way using the other hand and repeat. Do this nonstop for ten minutes.<br>  <br>  3. Ulis. This is a great exercise to increase girth. It is also very easy and does not take much time. Achieve a full erection and grip the base of your penis the same way you would if you were jelqing. <br>  <br>  Squeeze as hard as you can without causing discomfort. Your penis shaft should swell and your penis head should get big and shiny. Hold for ten seconds and rest for ten seconds. Repeat this three or four times.<br>  <br>  Do this routine every other day and make sure you warm your penis up before each workout by wrapping it in a hot washcloth for five minutes.<br>  <br>  4. A larger penis can be achieved with the use of penis enhancers. There are many forms of penis enhancement products such as pills, patches and topical oils. However, one unique natural product that can produce significant results and makes use of the body's natural abilities comes in the form of a liquid called super-vir <a href="http://www.super-vir.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-vir.com</a><br>  <br>  Always remember, if you are not satisfied with what you were born with, it is never too late to do something about it!|`|AwHauqasaa	Your thinking of jelquing. That is the name of penis enlargement exercises your are talking about. the idea is that you stretch the main muscle that contains the blood in the penis (when erect) thus allowing it to grow.<br>  <br>  With a traction device he has used some of these and manage to get an extra inch in about 8 months.<br>  <br>  You can read more at his jelquing website <a href="http://www,penishealth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www,penishealth.com</a>|`|5HKhla0Paa	I tried those exercises and they don't work. If<br>  done incorrectly, you can actually permanently<br>  damage your penis.<br>  <br>  I tried just about every penis enlargement product <br>  method, but nothing worked. Although I was<br>  really embarrassed, I asked my doctor what my <br>  options were to get a bigger penis. He recommended <br>  a clinically proven product that really works called <br>  VigRxPlus. I’ve been taking it for 7 months now, <br>  and my penis has grown a little over two inches<br>  with no side effects! <br>  <br>  This is definitely the best product that I have tried. <br>  Don’t waste your time and money on other <br>  products. They just don’t work!

Allergies can develop to things you've never been allergic to before...basically your system gets overloaded.  There's also the chance it could be some sort of bug bites...maybe mites or something hiding in your hair tie.  There are also some skin conditions that cause itching and bumps...like eczema.  Itching will make it worse.  Your best bet is to take a benadryl and apply some anti-itch cream.  If it continues, see the doctor or school nurse.

Iyvt7ibmaa	It's the nicotine rush along with the oxygen depravation when you first smoke. It normally only lasts the first two or three puffs. Since you smoke little, your body isn't used to the nicotine entering your bloodstream in such a fast pace, and isn't used to the lack of oxygen that's being placed by the nicotine. This, along with the fact that nicotine acts as a chemical that can cause your blood pressure to drop, causes that light headed feeling, or the feeling of being high. <br>  Hope that helped :)|`|df805281ce1bc1c7c3de30c04dbcb458aa	I think your mistaking high with being lightheaded and that can happen when you smoke.

Cut her a bit of slack, yes it's been two years, but this is still brand new in her life.  She's going to have this disease forever (or until a cure), so it does take a little accommodation!  <br>  It becomes dangerous if your sugar's become way too low - but there a lot of warning signs with that.. her mood changes, sweaty, heart racing, confused.. the lows can kill you quickly if you don't catch them, but they're hard to miss.<br>  <br>  It becomes dangerous if you let your sugars run high for a long period of time - like if they're constantly in the 14's lets say.  If she gets a bad reading every now and then, don't freak.<br>  <br>  It's nice you care about your sister, I'm sure she really appreciates, but make sure not to jump down her throat too much, or nag her - that becomes extremely frustrating.<br>  <br>  If she takes care of herself, she can lead a healthy and normal life just like you!|`|AA11599407	Diabetics can expect a shorter life span, the best defense is to be very particular with all aspect of care, meds, diet, etc. It is very hard for juveniles but they must be encouraged and as they get older they will do better.|`|BhFeii5Xaa	A friend of mine was diagnosed 54 years ago with diabetes. She has not been all that careful about taking care of herself, especially when she was a teenager, but it isn't anything connected with the diabetes that is killing her right now.

This response is coordinated by white blood cells known as CD4 lymphocytes. These lymphocytes are also the main targets of HIV, which attaches to the cells and then enters them. Once inside, the virus inserts its own genetic material into the lymphocytes and makes copies of itself.<br>  <br>  When the new copies of the virus break out of the host cells and enter the bloodstream, they search for other cells to attack. In the meantime, the old host cells and some uninfected CD4 cells die from the effects of the virus. The cycle repeats itself again and again. In the process, billions of new HIV particles are produced every day. Eventually, the number of CD4 cells in the body decreases, leading to severe immune deficiency, which means your body can no longer effectively fight off viruses and bacteria that cause disease.<br>  <br>  How HIV is transmitted<br>  You can become infected with HIV in several ways, including:<br>  <br>      * Sexual transmission. You may become infected if you have vaginal, anal or oral sex with an infected partner whose blood, semen or vaginal secretions enter your body. You can also become infected from shared sexual devices if they're not washed or covered with a condom. The virus is present in the semen or vaginal secretions of someone who's infected and enters your body through small tears that can develop in the vagina or rectum during sexual activity. If you already have another sexually transmitted disease, you're at much greater risk of contracting HIV. Contrary to what researchers once believed, women who use the spermicide nonoxynol 9 also may be at increased risk. This spermicide irritates the lining of the vagina and may cause tears that allow the virus into the body.<br>      * Transmission through infected blood. In some cases, the virus may be transmitted through blood and blood products that you receive in blood transfusions. Since 1985, American hospitals and blood banks have screened the blood supply for HIV antibodies. This blood testing, along with improvements in donor screening and recruitment practices, has substantially reduced the risk of acquiring HIV through a transfusion.<br>      * Transmission through needle sharing. HIV is easily transmitted through needles and syringes contaminated with infected blood. Sharing intravenous drug paraphernalia puts you at high risk of HIV and other infectious diseases such as hepatitis. Your risk is greater if you inject drugs frequently and also engage in high-risk sexual behavior. Avoiding the use of injected drugs is the most reliable way to prevent infection. If that isn't an option, you can reduce your risk by participating in a needle exchange program that allows you to trade used needles and syringes for sterile ones.<br>      * Transmission through accidental needle sticks. Transmission of the virus between HIV-positive people and health care workers through needle sticks is low. Experts put the risk at far less than 1 percent.<br>      * Transmission from mother to child. Each year, nearly 600,000 infants are infected with HIV, either during pregnancy or delivery or through breast-feeding. But if women receive treatment for HIV infection during pregnancy, the risk to their babies is significantly reduced. In the United States, most pregnant women are pre-screened for HIV, and anti-retroviral drugs are readily available. Not so in developing nations, where women seldom know their HIV status, and treatment is often limited or nonexistent. When medications aren't available, Caesarean section is sometimes recommended instead of vaginal delivery.

E1B3o80naa	I just had the same thing happen to me and I was trying to research what it could be.  It have 4 in one armpit, and 3 in the other.  I was also in a hot tub a few days ago.  Seeing that you were in one too, that makes me think it has something to do with the hot tub.  Hope yours is feeling better, mine are so painful.  Advil is really helping.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I am adding to my answer now.  I have done some research and it looks like it is called hot tub folliculitis.  It says it will clear up in 2-10 days.  Hopefully is goes away soon, cause it hurts!!!|`|271d63aa0f46b41decb6d6a9f2574fadaa	Could be swollen lymph nodes, indicating an infection some place in your body. See a doctor.|`|SCeIOtZpaa	If you only had one I would suggest that you probably had an ingrown hair, because those can be really painful when they occur in the armpit, but since you got one on the other side too, I would definitely think it's something different, and like the previous poster posted, there are lymph nodes in that area, so you should look into it. Ask your doctor, or go to an urgent care facility so you can make sure it isn't serious...

y4SUDnpaaa	I understand how much you want to help her but this is way too serious for you to handle on your  own. The respondents have given you plenty of sensible reasons for her behavior but none of them or you can change her. She needs t see a psychiatrist as soon as possible. When you make the appointment either ask to see the doctor for 15 minutes of her session  or have a phone conference before he sees her so you are sure he has the facts she may or may not tell him. Don't indulge her by treating her like a baby and please stop trying to figure out what to do on your own. If you had the expertise to solve her problem you would have done it by now.|`|9EVcTnUWaa	You say that you've talked to her doctor but you don't say that she has a therapist.  She needs help dealing with her past what ever it was so that she can move past it.  You need to get her an appointment with a child psychologist as soon as possible.  You might also want to have some family therapy with her so that you're both on the same page as to what she needs and what it would take to get her better.  You also don't say if she's ever been tested for an psychological problems or learning disabilites.  I really think that she needs a therapist someone who trained in childhood and adolescent psychologist. IF you can find one who has experince with child hood traumas that would help you and the doctor specifically figure out what her issues are.  Also as an adopted child she might be dealing with some issues that she's not felt comfortable dealing with you about.|`|4yrqRS4qaa	your daughter sounds very ill and i think any suggestion here is not enough. hopefully you have theapists and drs working with you who are specialized in what kind of help she needs.<br>  it's got to be very very difficult.|`|AA10500537	take her to a psychiatrist   soon|`|tKr7sXEJaa	this is a disease called infantalism that happens when a child may have been abused or somehting. i read that she was adopted so that may have been that in the past something happened.

It happens to my sister a lot so she lays on my bed and sobs for hours or talks like a baby and eats baby food. But a therapist is the way to go, therapy is the best way to help her. The reason she is like this was she had a traumatic childhood and wants to re-live it in a more positive manner.|`|stsSDAwJaa	You need to find a psychiatrist, because this could quite possibly require medication. While I was reading your post a thought occured to me (it may be a reach depending on your standpoint): You said she was adopted right? So perhaps she's trying to re-live her childhood, because she might have been neglected or something like that. Well anyways, if I am wrong, then I'm sorry. Oh, also, you shoul not encourage this behavior, so don't treat her like a baby. You SHOULD, however, try to encourage her to act and dress normally like she does at school. Try your very hardest to be patient with her, and speak softly when you try to persuade her to act normally. I hope this helps, and good luck. :D
14e3f62e4aadac6dc3e97d2ea1b5e895aa	If you had the dental work done on the same side of  your face where the swollen gland is, it could very well  be from the dental work.    I would like to suggest that there may have been some  infection in or around the root of the tooth that you had  capped.  When the tooth was repaired, there was no place for the infection to drain and therefore it might be  sitting there with no place to go and your lymph gland  is trying to supply antibodies to kill the infection.    The only way you can know for sure is go back to  the dentist that did the work and explain it to him/her.  they can either prescribe an antibiotic or maybe just  open the infected spot and let it drain.  good luck!|`|CHQqhz7baa	Dental work can cause the most devastating infections because once the tooth is closed off, the infection has access to the blood stream so you need to go STRAIGHT back to the dentist and make sure you take some antibiotics to clear it up. If you cannot see him straight away go to your doctor asap and get onto some antibiotics.
PlEEZTRsaa	No,it may be infected,make a call in the morning,you should not be charged any more monies,they must fix what you had already paid for.|`|Td5t0S54aa	no not at all normal  get an x ray done   consult a new dentist  he has messed up ur teeth    improper or incomplete root canal treatment  in the mean time have antibiotics and pain killers  dont chew from the affected side    its a dentists advice|`|IDgSVPBxaa	Not to have pain after two weeks. I should know I've had eight root canals done over the past 10 years.  The pain never last longer than a week at the most.  So I would call the orthodontist or surgeon who did your root canal and have it checked out IMMEDIATELY.|`|VDmh1N3Aaa	No it's not normal. You need to see your dentist right away. Actually I would go see a different dentist as this should not have happened. Makes me wonder what the heck they did to you.|`|AA11673068	No its not normal...Last time I had under gone RCT..and I had the same problem...I immediately went back to the dentist..it may be because there was some pus thats formed inside..check with dentist again...|`|Gmlv2Ou2aa	is the root canal fiing completed? there is apossibility where cleaning of the roots ahas been done and amedicine placed inside for observation for few days. visit your dentist for knowing about the condition. if the pain doesnt subside then the tooth would not be a success in rot canal trt.

It is possible to eat to much of it and that isn't good. My understanding is that 50-60 grams is usually plenty, although you can probably get away with a little more. You might want to take calcium supplements because high protein leaches calcium from the bones. Also make sure you eat lower fat sources of protein. Your workouts sound good and it is good to give  yourself a few days off like you are doing. Good luck.|`|3WqFyJPyaa	veryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy niceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee... keeep it upppppppppppppppppppppppp
tIldpr7vaa	you have to be lifting weights for extra protein to have any effect. taking in extra protein without working out is pointless, u will see no muscle gains from protein alone.<br>  <br>  but if u r lifting weights, u should be taking in about 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight daily. that would be alotta of meat, so thats where protein shakes come in.|`|cxzQVRYiaa	I heard somewhere that the bigger your muscles get, the smaller your penis gets.  I haven't noticed any difference in myself yet, but then again, I only joined the gym last week.|`|9ZUFDDqoaa	i don't know exactly how it works, but protien does aid in building muscle. Umm, I would chose a better meat since ham is LOADED with salt. Try chicken or turkey. An increase in protein is good, just don't overdo it or you could get protein poisoning. Especially from lean meats. But, that's if you eat like massive amounts of protein. I think you'll be just fine.
9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	No, all hormonal contraceptives carry some degree of DVT risk. If you have a family history of blood clots then you'd need to avoid the Mini pill - progestogen only. The combined pill would be more suitable for you.<br>  <br>  The only other options are the Copper coil IUD- problem with the copper coil is that it typically makes periods heavier and longer. The female condom is another option or male condoms.|`|39e46128b8ea5a82c45af42790e8132daa	All hormonal methods have that same side effect.|`|MvMMIxjIaa	i didnt think there is anything u can take orally, u could consider the femidome( female condom) or a copper coil that contains no hormones, but they can cause heavy bleeding, Your Dr. is the best one to advise u on this as he/she will have to prescribe it for you and answer any of your concerns, they can also monitor your progress on which ever form you choose. good luck

It sound to me like you need closure on whatever the issue is.  I'm no psychologist, but I can tell you that when something is really pressing or important and we don't address it, then it tends to fester and resurface unexpectedly until we confront it, come to terms with it and then we can sort of let it go.|`|EZt7ZHIiaa	It's a tough question to answer because "irrational thoughts" is such a broad category of things that you could be thinking about or what you are having a hard time with right now.  The way to deal with irrational thoughts of a relationship after a tough breakup, is a little different than dealing with irrational thoughts of constantly wondering if you left the oven on even though you've checked it a thousand times.|`|uJKTR4d2aa	Come on guy, it looks like your TRYING your HARDEST to be able to say you have a mental disorder.

If you are prone to stress, worry and anxiety, getting a stupid thought out of your mind can seem impossible. Believe me i know.     people advise to write down your feeling and worries, compartmentalize them and them forget about them..this has never worked for me either.     sometimes i get a little thought in my mind and it spirals until i'm in a frenzy over something that hasn't happened and might never....personally i cant relax ever.     it would help if you said what your thought were...  cheers|`|8Ak1FehYaa	sounds as if you are OCD about something you cannot controlk and you want to control it so you make yourself think about it until you find a way to control it or solve it, I do this to myself, to change myself from thinkign about soemthing until i resolve it, I have to stop worrying about it, I busy myself with other things to get my mind of if the thing. Trying to do things in our own power will driv eyou crazy instea d of giving it to God (if you are religious-if not sorry for bringing it up) but sayign that is easy, doing it is hard, if you let go of it then you loose control, and its hard to do. But its making you unhappy so...you have to realize you can;t control people or situations and you can let things you can;t control make you unhappy or you can let it go and be happy.|`|iybezfi6aa	Okay.

2c556debd7c1c18834aeac39fbfe496caa	Unfortunately you can't get help without your parents, but you can talk to a counselor at school..The counselor can recommend you need to seek professional help..Parents sometimes forget what it's like to be a teenager and maybe they didn't have all the anxiety you have , so they don't think it's anything but teen hormones..Don't give up seeking help. If talking to the counselor doesn't work then I suggest you call 911 and tell them you don't want to live anymore..that will definitely get your parents attention..Please don't harm yourself..Life is such a blessing and Your needed here on earth..Good Luck to you.|`|GBRmOem8aa	Well sweetie there is places that you can go without your parents help.... You can go straight to a therapists office or to the police station... trust me they helped me.... you can go there and say that your parents don't want to help you with your depression and you feel you need help.... and they will ask for your information and they will tell you where you can go an they will help you find people....  you don't always need to turn toyour parents for everything.... you can find what you need on your own, you just need to work harder.... I understand not being motivated and not wanting to talk to your parents.... I am 16 years old and I have been through a lot myself... since I was 12 I have been depressed and using drugs, cutting, not eating, running away, and definitely no commnunication with my parents or anyone for that matter.... recently I got the help I needed and it allowed me to open up with my parents and others a little bit.... there is still a lot they don't know... but hey who needs to know everything right? Sweetie I think you can get the help you need without your parents and I think that you definitely need help for the depression.... And so you know dying is not fun, I have died 2 times... from overdose.... and it's not a great thing... and I have no idea who I was or anything about my past anymore... so really you need to get the depression taken care of.... and I know you can do it....   Good luck, dear.|`|NWqtXfOHaa	well i would go talk to the preacher at your church.they can help you in so many ways.he could even talk to your parents of its needed.i went through depression not to long ago.i talked to a doc. and one thing they told me to do is get a book and write down how you feel andwhat's brothering you .then you can give it to your parents or someone you can trust not to judge you.sometimes it's your best friend,preacher,or school consler.also you can write the things you like about yourself and the things you don't like about yourself and the things you don't like about yourself you can decide if you can change it or not ,if you can't do anything about it find a way to deal with it . but i realy think you should talk to your preacher at church they can help you ,he can give you things to read in the bible that will help you.  but just remeber you're so special to so many people and just because your parents don't understand doesn't mean they dont love you cause they do ,they just don't know how to handle this.I pray you talk to your preacher soon .just remeber your special and there's so many people that love you.
xmibEEdcaa	Is it not only on your forehead, but also right between your eyes?  It could be a sinus headache - there are a lot of sinus-y head colds going around right now, and often the headache's the first symptom to show up.  <br>  <br>  Try a decongestant like Sudafed or one of the over-the-counter medicines that are specifically for sinus relief, and see if that helps at all.<br>  <br>  If you determine that it is your sinuses, then you might also find it helpful to breathe in some hot steam.  Either take a really hot shower or fill a bowl with hot water and just lean over it, inhaling.|`|TOd1ZowPaa	Rub your temples, or lay down on a pillow with an icepack.|`|HypqcnJaaa	Stop partying!!!|`|VQlXF8Ucaa	What you are describing are actually sinus headaches.

KtJmEx1zaa	Actually, eating a lot of kale is helpful, but if you eat olive oil on it that will really satisfy your appetite.

Cats could live on milk, but those on pasteurized milk got sick and developed genetic weakness in a generation, and past 3rd generation they were dead.

fwWO14fIaa	the truth is it is possible but it isn't healthy, the best way to lose weight is gradually week by week, aim to lose 2 pounds of fat every week, and that's 8 pounds of fat loss in a month. the best way to do this is to eat 500 less calories a day, this can be done either by exercising or watching your diet.|`|R0gbfIJXaa	I think you would have to do a lot of running or high intensity cardio to do that.  I think that running for one hour at a fast pace burns about 700 calories. You would also have to do some strength training probably. The more muscle you build, the more calories you will burn at a resting state. When you do strength training, make sure to let your muscles rebuild for two or three days inbetween. I usually do arms on day, take a day off, then do legs.
lyuWTIo6aa	my number 1 solution any NEUTROGENA acne wash..i STRONGLY recommend the grapefruit extract daily wash..its a daily cleanser that mosturizes your skin while getting rid of acne. you can find this at basically any drugstore or department stores like walmart kroger of meijer. and the most it can cost you is 7 dollars. but i use it everyweek and it makes a huge difference... also eating a lot of oranges gets rid of oily skin|`|DwinhfBraa	You are probably going through puberty and you should shower or bathe daily.

I know how hard it is (i'm 16, 127 lbs)<br>  i'm still in school and it's tourture when they have cookies and pizza. It's gonna be hard, so do it only if you wnat to lose weight, not because you want some guy to like you, or you want to fit in more or w/e. I also suggest you do stength training to tone up and not look like a bag of cellulite. Of course cardio to actually lose weight. I think i heard you have to walk an hour at face pace before you consider running to get your heart use to it.<br>  Don't skip meals because it's bad for you.

You aren't burning fat.  Since you do go to the gym be sure not to eat after you work out, it's counter productive.  After you workout your body replenishes the used up energy from the exercise with whatever is currently being digested in your stomach.  If you don't eat, it will have to tap into your reserves (fat), thus making you burn calories from fat.|`|DkO1hedOaa	Sorry, but you can't do that to yourself. You will overheat MAJORLY.  Not a good idea!<br>  If you wanna loose weight, you have to work for it. Eat healthier, exercise a lot, etc. Don't starve or overexercise yourself though!<br>  The ideal way to loose weight is to eat six small, but healthy and filling meals per day. This keeps your metabolism going. REMEMBER: when you stop eating, your body creates fat so you do not starve to death.<br>  Also, exercise! Run, and do crunches and sign up for a yoga class.Just get your body active and burning calories!<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|31ijHkkmaa	Hi there!!<br>  <br>  You sound like your pretty self confident and that actually really helps your body.

Mro8j1yYaa	okay just relax... i know its really scary and whatever but just know that everyone goes through it.  Your mom is going to find out eventually so just tell her.  Trust me she will be happy.  She may even cry haha. Stayfree and Always seem to be good brands of pads.  I don't usually wear pads bc tampons are much more comfortable but bc it is your first time pads are probably better.  Hmm i would say change it every 2 hours maybe? it depends on how much blood you have. You can usually read on the side of the box how much is heavy or light. Just get a regular pack.  Your going to be fine!!

I used heavy pads just to be safe.  My mom gave me lighter ones, but I was too nervous to only where light pads at school.  <br>  <br>  A couple years later I used tampons (and that is what I mainly use now) but those are definitely something I would have your mom talk to you about - because those are sometimes a little trickier.
XOlnc8iBaa	You would sleep maybe 2-3 hours. Your body clock is on, and even sleeping pills cannot stop it. You can be woken up but you will feel drugged, groggy, and you'll be in a very bad mood. You will wander around, get nothing done, coz you switched your brain off, but your body wants to move. You will be like a walking corpse, I know coz I did this for years.
N5HS6QU6aa	I am so sorry to hear about your sadness and hopelessness.  It seems your boyfriend had a mental disorder that wasn't being treated.  It's hard to have a loved one who has something wrong and won't or can't get the help they need.  Our love cannot fix their illness, so never think you could have done more to prevent his suicide.  <br>  <br>  My husband has had mental health issues since before we were married and I finally left him after 4 years and 2 children because I couldn't fix it for him and he didn't get help from a professional.  It's hard to live through another persons mental illness.  Its easy to look at them and see what they need to do, but so difficult when they don't listen to our advice.  <br>  <br>  Anyways, I went through this whole story with a point in mind.  We need to take care of ourselves.  We may go through crises and think we need to weather the storms on our own.  If all we learn from those that we've loved who have suffered, its that we need to get help when help's needed.  If that be from family, close friends, a support group or through individual therapy (all of those things together would be awesome), but it needs to be done.  I started with individual therapy and the rest came after that.<br>  <br>  You deserve the best life has to offer.  You deserve to be happy.  You deserve love from someone who isn't toxic and that will come soon enough.  First and Foremost you need to love yourself.  If you don't love yourself, it will be one of the biggest challenges you'll ever face to be able to do that.  I'm finally at a place where I've realized my needs are important.  I'm important.  My life is never going to be perfect.  None of us can ever control what happens in life, but we can strive to be the best person to face those tough challenges when they arise.  I was finally able to leave my husband, but that took years.  I needed to first love myself.<br>  <br>  Peace will come to you.  Have faith.  You are strong and your strength will help you face the tough roads ahead.  You will get through this.  Just show up for therapy even if it means you just sit there and say nothing the entire hour.  All it takes, in the beginning, is a commitment to "show up" no matter how you feel.  It starts with this day.  And, tomorrow starts with tomorrow.  If you just manage to get through the day without looking forward or backward, just concentrating on how to make it through THIS day, the future won't look so bleak.  I promise you that you CAN do this.<br>  <br>  Well, I've blabbed and blabbed and hopefully something I've said speaks to you.  Get the help you deserve.  You are strong, you are capable and I believe in you.<br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  Amy|`|5wJLH3cmaa	you poor thing :(<br>  i am 15, so i have to admit i am no expert on matters of the heart, but in my opinion, you won't find love until you both love yourself and are capable of loving someone else. that sounds pretty cliche i know. <br>  from the way you are talking, you might have a bit of depression, or rather maybe Post Traumatic Stress Disorder which isn't majorly serious but seeing a therapist would help. <br>  do you have any family you can visit? good friends? maybe your loneliness could be helped with a visit to someone you love, not in the romantic sense.  <br>  you'll find love. just don't give up.|`|872fcc76954a83920779a9df510b118baa	hun i just want to say i know how you feel.  it's not common to feel as low are you are right now, but keep your head up and look forward.... you are stronger now since you've been through this experience. just remember you can always talk to me about anything.  i had a suicidal parent growing up and i lost a parent early in life.  i know it's affected my outer life in ways still.  but i can take the challenges i've faced and turn them into something beautiful.  i know you can do the same.  remember this life were given is ours to navigate and you can do whatever good in your mind it is you dream of doing along the way.|`|5T32VHavaa	I'm so sorry about your boyfriend, I know what that's like.. <br>  Don't give up on yourself, it is not worth it. I know what it's like to feel sad, empty, or alone. It's horrible. But it WILL get better. Keep yourself busy, and I would make an appointment to a psychiatrist, you need to talk to someone. People care about you, you're definitely not alone|`|SjZ2lgQyaa	I just lost a loved one recently as well, and it's not fun. It feels like the grieving will never end, but eventually you will feel better. In the meantime, maybe it would help to talk to a counselor. Just so you can talk to someone about your feelings and it may help you cope better. Or you could talk to a family member or friend.<br>  I am sorry for your loss!|`|8lEZAwvYaa	You have just lost a loved one so its understandable you will be feeling down, but if this continues i would advise you to go to your doctor, you cannot let this eat you up, good luck huni<br>  <br>  xxx|`|cfc6c0f015d8ca942aaceca074dfb71aaa	First of all, I am sorry for your loss. You are going through the stages of grief, which is normal. Having a person close to you die by suicide is very distressing. Just remember, you didn't have anything to do with his decision. It was his and his alone. Love is a funny thing, when you least expect it, boom, there it is. As soon as you can, begin reaching forward toward normalcy. I hope there is someone you can talk to, a friend, clergy, even your boss. Talking about your feelings, even the angry ones can be helpful. If you feel you have reached rock bottom, the only other direction is up. I have found for myself, that if I start writing about what I feel, what I do everyday, it starts to help. Then I read back over it a few days later. Sometimes I just go outside and work like crazy in my yard, really physical stuff. Anything to break the feelings of despair and anger. Don't let this go any further without seeking professional help. When you are ready for love again, I bet it will be there. Good Luck.|`|vkjNVrBUaa	too much of an "I' story in your life.  just be in the present moment and you'll find the vast majority of moments have nothing to do with this story you keep telling about yourself.  mostly you just tell your story to yourself anyway.  nobody else really has the time to listen to it.  it sure keeps away your boredom, though.  you keep up this dramatic story because you believe facing the present moment is boring.  but really it's your key to happiness.  your life story is miserable.   you might not feel so important and serious, but happiness will require you to become more of a nobody.
jgvfU1d3aa	Hi<br>  I've had my braces on for just over 3 years... One of the main problems with my teeth was that the top teeth rest over the bottom. However this is being fixed!<br>  <br>  You will probably get normal fixed braces to both bottom and top teeth, then the orthodentist will add some hooks to the braces. (They're only little (:  ) You'll then have to wear some small elastic bands which can be put on the pairs of hooks on your teeth. How you put the elastic on depends on what your o'dentist tells you. I have to wear 2 elastics. One on the right side of my mouth and the other on left. They'll pull your teeth together, so you'll probably not be able to eat or talk with them on, so you'll wear them at night. After the treatment you might have to wear a permenant retainer on the back of your teeth to stop them shifting back.

wwRbkCMraa	Usually losing weight is simple numbers. You need to know your basic metabolic rate (BMR). Once you know your BMR then you can design a diet lower in calories than your BMR.<br>  <br>  But.... it is not always that simple. You could also have metabolic anomalies or even hormone irregularities that can make losing weight virtually impossible. <br>  <br>  Start with the simple stuff. Calculate your BMR right here <a href="http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calcul...</a>  then alter your diet if necessary.<br>  <br>  Now, if you don't see results after that you may look into the hormonal or metabolic areas. Also make sure you are being realistic, and that you do have weight to use. Don't forget... celebrities use tons of drugs and have personal trainers!

AIsvSsEKaa	Hey man, I've been there.<br>  <br>  There is a lot of bad advice out there. Some good and some really really bad. <br>  <br>  The best thing to do is to see your doctor. There are different reasons for going bald and sometimes medication can help. But you really need to know what to expect so you can plan your hair style. Since you are 23, you may be able to change the balding process. <br>  <br>  Buzzing your hair is a totally good thing to do. It always looks great and is super easy to maintain. If you want some clinical advice, try the following web site. They are the American Academy of Family Practitioners. <br>  www.aafp.org/afp/990415ap/2189.html <br>  <br>  I don't think they sell anything, but they have great information.

wLWgCRFcaa	You don't need to get them removed at all ever unless they are crowding the rest of your teeth.  Removing wisdom teeth for no good reason is just a money grab.  My family dentist warned me about that a long time ago, and I listened.  I never had mine removed, and they've been no problem.  Just  be sure you clean your teeth properly, as wisdom teeth are far back in the mouth and take more diligence to clean.|`|fvuEtkROaa	If they are not impacted or pushing your other teeth out of alignment, there does not seem to be a reason to have them removed.  I am not a dentist, but I believe "if it's not broken, don't fix it."  Other people may have a different opinion.|`|NKurMFuTaa	If you're dentist/oral surgeon suggested getting them removed now, discuss the reasons with them. The potential problem is the teeth could shift and cause major changes in the rest of your mouth. Some people never need the wisdom teeth removed though, and you may be one of these lucky people.|`|j2VDYbeoaa	Sure, go ahead and wait till you have insurance. Keep in mind cavities are common on wisdom teeth. I had my top wisdom teeth removed about 15 years ago due to decay, and just 2 months ago had the bottom ones out for the same reason. The bill hurts more than the procedure!!|`|utVANWDWaa	Not everyone needs their wisdom teeth extracted if they grow in normally.

4d609fcce5f5f73d048fa387f7f37eacaa	What do you mean by bad?<br>  <br>  Is it harmful? Not especially. Often it's recommended for large breasted women to wear bras to prevent sagging. With an A cup, it's not really a problem.<br>  <br>  However, the social norm in the US is for women of a certain age to wear bras. You can tell when a woman isn't wearing a bra, and people will make assumptions about you because you are operating outside of the norm (they might think you're slutty, or a hippie, or...? Get what I'm saying?). If this is not a big deal to you, then be bra-free, my friend.|`|MvMMIxjIaa	No, its not bad not to wear a bra, at ure size there is less chance of sagging, and also if ure comfortable that's all that matters. Your skin elasticity is very good at ure age so be free!!! The only reason we wears bras is for support i.e the over shoulder boulder holders!!! & for shape under clothes.|`|xrA4DxRLaa	Well, that's completely up to you.

No! My wife was a sexy 32 A too, She went braless a lot.|`|S1jddreQaa	Kinda, I mean it up to you, but it might be a good idea to wear one.<br>  <br>  Edit: well thats ok, as long as your nipples aren't like sticking out, lol.|`|zuQawLygaa	It might look kinda funny even if you can't see your nipples just the shape of you breast. But it's really up to youu. If you don't like wearing bras try a sports bra they are so comfortable and most of the time it feels like your wearing nothing. Hope this helps :)<br>  <br>  <br>  But if you wearing a real bra you will look fuller in size if you want to look larger. If not stick with a sports bra. But then again it's really your decission.<br>  <br>  <br>  It's not unhealthy for you not because you don't need that much supports but socially other people might think it's a little strange considering that most girls around the age of 17 do wear bras.|`|vzQBmR4Paa	its only bad if nobody notices.|`|tMJhvpeEaa	it's not bad at all|`|Am0xRpEjaa	yeah they are gonna sag in the future

v1nUmhLTaa	Your hymen is the thin skin covering the entry to your vagina. It can be broken by sex, as the others have mentioned, but also by riding a horse, doing gymnastics, masturbation, doing the splits, or any number of other ways. Some women are even born without one.<br>  <br>  There is a restoration surgery, usually done by women in religions or ethnicities that require proof of virginity. However, since the only way to lose your virginity is to have sexual intercourse its absence doesn't actually mean much if you haven't had it.<br>  <br>  If you want to tighten your vaginal walls, Kegal exercises can help. Avoiding penetration for 2-4 months can also return the walls to their original or near original state, making them feel tighter when once again penetrated.|`|N8cAwzxzaa	Hymen? Your hymen is the film inside you that breaks when your first have intercourse. It is the thing that makes you a virgin. There is no tightening or untightening of your hymen.<br>  If you're talking about your vagina, think pelvic floor. Like holding in a wee, hold it, then release.|`|pLirJP9Taa	Your hymen cannot be tightened. After you have sex, your hymen is gone. the hymen is the skin covering at the entrance to the vagina. The vagina itself cannot be tightened. Only through a waiting period will the muscles and tissues have time to relax and will tighten over time. My suggestion is to not have sex and it won't be loose.

I worked off 25 pounds, it clearly does produce results!

BGPuQsXuaa	I am 14 and use a leg press machine. It basically works the butt, hamstring and basically the whole leg. It is very effective and has trimmed my legs. I also combined leg curls with it. It is not painful, but gives you the workout burn that tells you you are doing the exercise correctly. awesome workout and really tones those legs. Before doing the leg press, run or warm up on a treadmill.

2yI17yqFaa	The formula for losing those extra pounds is easy - eat less and move more often - the issues surface when we in reality try to put that into practice! There are plenty of stumbling blocks out there aren't there?! The one thing which really showed results for me was wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box below, they have a small number of free trials remaining, it has been featured in Reader's Digest and CNN. I lost twenty pounds, it really does work!
UZJ7wVc8aa	The key to starting an exercise routine is to make the changes slowly. You can't go from being sedentary to active overnight and hope to succeed. Start out by exercising 1-2 times per week and eventually moving up to 3-5 times per week. Only increase the amount of exercise you do per week when you feel ready.<br>  <br>  Exercise routines also have to be well rounded to be successful. You need elements of flexibility, cardiovascular and strength training. You don't need to go to the gym to get a good workout, but having access to that type of equipment is a definite plus. Flexibility isn't very intensive and can be done on most if not all days of the week. It won't directly help you with your goals but it will lead to better performance - it will make exercising a lot easier.<br>  <br>  Cardio should be done 3-5 times per week while strength training should be done 2-3 times per week. The more weight you want to lose, the more you need to exercise.

It's just because they're tense usually and putting in a tampon while you tense is really painful you were probably just relaxed and that's why.

Hope this helps!
i6uzNQcJaa	it depends on your diet too|`|Gh2Yydl3aa	about two weeks just stick to ur routine
R0gbfIJXaa	I am pretty sure that you can't sneak anything on that diet. The idea is to make your body start burning off fat, and to do that it can't have anything else to burn, thats why you can't have any solid foods. I had a friend who did it and lost maybe 10 pounds in a week, but it was all water weight because she put it right back on once she started eating again. I heard it was good for 'resetting' your diet because once you finish, you arent supposed to crave anything you used to eat so you can start on a fresh diet and supposedly you wont crave the bad foods you used to eat. I don't know how well that works though.|`|Jz0GtOUjaa	It is possible to lose weight fast but you should be realistic and comprehend that if you lose weight quickly then you will inevitably put it all back on again just as quickly.

UZJ7wVc8aa	Everyone has a problem spot. It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.<br>  <br>  When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat. <br>  <br>  The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs. You can read more about fixing your trouble spots at the Guide to Reducing Body Fat - <a href="http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/reducebodyfat.html" rel="nofollow">http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/r...</a>|`|YL1NQ8ntaa	The lowest impact exercise I know, that is stress on the joints, is in-line skating. You will end up with leaner thighs, but they have more muscle. If you are into another exercise or sport which stress the knee, in-line skating will strengthen the muscles around the knee. I recommend working for endurance. I skate an hour and try to cover 8+ miles so I am not lopping along. Your stomach benefits as long as you maintain good strides and posture. <br>  <br>  Best Wishes.|`|hz6Lo0wraa	Cardio workouts. Run, jog, jumping-jacks, whatever works for you. Then start toning the area with your standard sit-up type routines. Always remember you want to continually change what type of exercise is working out each muscle. For example, do not do the same types of squats each day. Buy a few workout videos. This way you can workout at home with no eyes checking you out. Once you build a collection, you can just pick what type of workout suits you that day.|`|72WcarmPaa	For the stomach there is the crunch or sit up. For the legs I would suggest doing squats, they are very good for your legs and buttocks.
9pLdhuBnaa	No, I have never taken the birth control shot Depo-Provera before.  I did consider trying it a number of years ago but chose not to because it had a side effect potential that was very risky for me.<br>  <br>  However, from having talked to some who have used it one of the most common side effects that can occur because of it is weight gain which is mostly water due to the hormones in the medication.  Another very common side effect is that of mood swings.
MQ5Sq6wfaa	I highly doubt you would be riding uphill all of the time, unless it's a bike at the gym.  <br>  <br>  Burning the most calories comes from a combination of increased heart rate and resistance.  For example, if you use an elliptical machine with no resistance you will burn significantly less calories than if you up the resistance on the machine.  <br>  <br>  So, in my opinion running requires more effort and in my experiences elevates my heart rate more (especially if you run on an incline).  Bike riding is MUCH easier on your knees, feet and hips though.|`|TdjVHLOfaa	I would have said running -- because your using every muscle in your body to move and use the energy, providing more movement and more calories lost....<br>  <br>  bikes, just build muscle in legs, and tone stomache etc etc... <br>  but unless you do it that often -- you wont see much results.<br>  <br>  help this helps!! :)<br>  x|`|2qPtGTNcaa	Given that you ride uphill, definitely the bike. It burns 17% more calories than running, on average.|`|g10l9fKiaa	Defiantly running. Requires more of a cardiovascular workout which is what burns fat and calories. Biking will build more strength and tire you out without much of a heart rate. Though it really depends on how hard you push yourself for each.<br>  <br>  Running burns more calories as long as you push yourself and get your heart rate up.
9ee9c3634dd96d7e269a10b75b658e85aa	I don't think that you have a problem, though you should take some time to understand WHY you enjoy the sensation of pain before you truly make a final decision on that. If it's sexual, and only spanking, then it could be as simple as the sharing of sensation between your bottom and your genitals. Both areas of your body share a number of nerves and blood vessels in common. A spanking will slowly start to infuse the entire region, including your sexual organs, with blood and warmth, creating arousal. If this sounds like the process as you know it, then there's nothing odd about it.<br>  <br>  There are other legitimate reasons to enjoy pain that still don't make you mentally ill. However, I've only presented one option. To truly figure out your own mind, you have to decide what turns you on about the pain, and then consider why that is.|`|hBmafVYoaa	It's really not that weird at all. Very common indeed.  Certainly not a mental illness.|`|0HAn67yZaa	no, i think you just have a fetish.|`|3oswni4Vaa	this is not a mental illness; it is just called a fetish and some people do enjoy inflicted pain on themselves.<br>  but put simply, you do not have a mental illness.<br>  cannot say it clearer than that :D dont worry about what other people say :-)|`|e00fc1c299d34a3d8c47805b7ceab0a4aa	Pain and a bit of a red bum are fine. Its if you get to being beaten half dead and such that you should worry|`|rQBbK6iEaa	Well, having been a psychotherapist for many years I have to respectfully disagree with the first four responses and say, "yes, you COULD have a mental illness." Mind you, I'm not saying that you DO have one. A spanking fetish by itself certainly doesn't qualify as a mental illness. And sex can be very primal and intense, so sometimes pain tied in with sex can be part of that intensity. However, you say a few other things that would be warning signs to me if presented by a client. <br>  <br>  First, how a fetish is acted upon can range widely from occasional spicing things up to being the only way to be aroused or satisfied sexually. The more essential it becomes to getting sexual satisfaction (especially with a primary loving partner) the more likely it is to be (or become) a problem. And in the case of spanking or pain, the same is true for the intensity needed. <br>  <br>  Second, you say that you inflict pain on yourself. Most folks don't - in fact they try to avoid it. For many people self inflicted pain is a way of trying to release anxiety, or to feel connected to oneself. Folks in my line of work would generally consider that an unhealthy way to try and resolve those issues.<br>  <br>  Third, you say the harder it is, the more you crave it. I don't want to read too much into your word choice, but wanting it harder and "craving it" suggest the possiblity that you might be trying to achieve something through the pain that "pain" isn't actually capable of providing. If so, there are a couple of problems with using pain in that manner. First, our bodies tend to adapt to pain - so it takes increasingly higher amounts to get the same effect. And second, if you keep upping the ante, it gets increasingly dangerous. <br>  <br>  My suggestion? Well, since you're asking whether or not you have a mental illness - it would suggest that you at least have some degree of concern about all of this. Find yourself a therapist (and not a rookie for this type of situation) and explore it deeper with someone having adequate experience and expertise to truly help you resolve your concern. Don't get hung up on whether it's a "mental illness" or not; just go to understand yourself better and get clear about how you want this as part of your life. The internet is great for getting opinions, but that not always the same as useful help. You are talking about something that can become dangerous to you - and something that MAY be a component of a mental or emotional disorder. If it is only a fetish the worse that can happen is that you determine that to be the case and you make plans on how to enjoy it while keeping yourself safe. On the other hand, IF it is something more - my experience is that without treatment it has the potential to create significant problems and could have serious implications for your overall quality of life. <br>  <br>  Good luck,   Geoffrey
AA10713139	sorry to hear about your broken pelvis. I can relate.<br>  I currently have a healing fractured pelvis. It's now been<br>   about 7 weeks and I'm finally walking without<br>  any walking aids. However I can only stand/walk <br>  about 15 min max. <br>  <br>  Hang in there. This takes time and my fracture is not<br>  as serious as yours. Once I accepted it, I decided to<br>  make the best out of it by taking some online courses.<br>  Also, I didn't isolate myself. It really helps to have <br>  some sort of support person to talk to. You will heal!|`|jlQHB9dvaa	Your doctor should be answering all of these questions, not anyone here on the internet.<br>  As you go along with your recovery, doctor will tell you when to start walking more, keep you updated on your recovery time, give you pain meds when needed, and he will have to order physical therapy and let you know where to go and when to start going.<br>  Listen to his advice only, not anyone here.  They don't know your exact situation.

UZJ7wVc8aa	If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn). <br>  <br>  Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.<br>  <br>  Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories. You can find some more information at the Beginner's Guide to Dieting - <a href="http://straightdiet.com" rel="nofollow">http://straightdiet.com</a>|`|9ZUFDDqoaa	yeah exercise more and eat less. Get on a high fiber diet (works for me!) and eat a lot of protein to gain muscle. Make sure you do a combo of cardio and weight training. Don't do anything serious if you're just starting an exercise routine. You don't want to stress out your body. <br>  <br>  I do light weight/strength training plus some cardio everyday and I eat pretty healthy. But, you do this everyday, You should notice results in a week. I did. <br>  <br>  Ok, there is NO magic pill out there to make you lose weight. Maybe to aid along with a healthy diet and exercise. uhh, i'm not trying to be rude here, but you can't just sit on your *** and expect a miracle, sorry.<br>  <br>  I wish you luck on your weight loss journey though!
UZJ7wVc8aa	Everyone has a problem spot. It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.<br>  <br>  When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat. <br>  <br>  The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs. You can read more about fixing your trouble spots at the Guide to Reducing Body Fat - <a href="http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/reducebodyfat.html" rel="nofollow">http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/r...</a>|`|UZKg2odzaa	crunches will only work your upper abs. you also need to work your side and lower abs to get a toned stomach. <br>  <br>  try doing lots of cardio, that is the only way to burn off the fat that is on top of your abs.<br>  some other excersizes that would be good to do are leg lifts, side crunches and planks. <br>  fitnessmagazine.com has tons of examples :)
zrEDyQxGaa	Aripiprazole can cause severe muscle stiffness and tremors. Maybe you should talk to your doctor? Good luck. :)|`|pvYy6iTSaa	Stu - Yes, your recent shaky legs could be due to Abilify (aripiprazole).<br>  Some of the most common side effects associated with aripiprazole are anxiety, blurred vision, constipation, cough, headache, insomnia, lightheadedness, nausea, rash, restlessness, runny nose, sleepiness, tremors, vomiting, weakness, and weight gain. Long-term use may lead to a potentially irreversible condition with involuntary movements of the jaw, lips, and tongue. A potentially fatal complex referred to as neuroleptic malignant syndrome has been reported with anti-psychotic drugs, including aripiprazole. Patients who develop this syndrome may have high fevers, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, irregular pulse or blood pressure, rapid heart rate, excessive sweating, and heart arrhythmias.<br>     You need to stay in touch with your prescribing and treating physician, making absolutely sure he/she knows any and all prescription and non-prescription medicines you may be taking, along with the dose and frequency of each.  Careful cooperation is essential for better control.  I wish you success and hope your other problems will lessen.

UZJ7wVc8aa	Gaining weight & muscle is a two step process: you have to eat more and lift weights or engage in some sort of strength training routine.<br>  <br>  The most important rule to remember if you want to gain weight is to eat more calories than you burn. Only by doing this can your body use the excess energy to build muscle. If you eat less than you burn, there is no way to gain weight, it's as simple as that. Your first step is to figure out how many calories your body burns per day. Use this calculator <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a>  to get an estimate. Now eat more than you burn and you're on your way to gaining muscle.<br>  <br>  Gaining weight is as simple as eat more than you burn but if you want to gain muscle, you also need to exercise. If you just ate more without lifting weights, you'd just gain fat and become unhealthy and overweight. When you lift weights (or participate in any strength training) you're actually causing some damage to your muscles. <br>  <br>  When you rest, your body uses those extra calories to repair and rebuild the muscles. When this process is complete, the muscle is stronger and a bit bigger than it was before. You obviously won't notice a difference right away, but over time you will find yourself becoming stronger and bigger.<br>  <br>  You need to keep your diet clean to gain the right kind of weight. Stay away from sugary and simple carb foods such as candy, foods made with white flour, soda and other junk. These foods will promote fat storage, something you don't need. Stick to foods made from whole wheat flour, oats, brown rice, lean sources of protein (chicken, some cuts of beef, fish), nuts, beans, legumes and protein shakes - yum yum.

7k8iwvvOaa	Aspartame has a very very long list of side effects connected to it.  Many feel it should not be allowed in food products because of this.

teXYeBxBaa	I was hypnotized to stop smoking several years ago. I left the Dr.s office and had absolutely no craving. My mom went with me and went for a session too. She walked right out of the session and lit up a cig.<br>  It's my understanding that all people can't be hypnotized. It depends a lot on their ability to be suggestible. Some say you can be to strong minded to be hypnotized.  With that being said, whether or not hypnotherapy works is going to depend a lot on your personality type. <br>  Hope this helps.

PUXmTrnMaa	ask your self this question. If it were true do you think 60% of our population would be obese? If we could just take a pill and sit on our butts and loose weight do you think the fitness industry would be a $200,000,000 buisness. I think you get my point. Nothing and I mean nothing will take the place of proper nutrition and exercise. If it were easy it wouldn't be so special to have a tone sexy body :-)|`|VbvrG9NJaa	no <br>  diet and excersise always works|`|NK9Qc46Paa	I have been through it all and know what's it about.  The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.  <br>  <br>  Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.  <br>  <br>  First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...<br>  <br>  This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.<br>  <br>  However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at <a href="http://starturl.com/efblc" rel="nofollow">http://starturl.com/efblc</a> along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.

I know, the thought of doing that to one of my cats doesn't appeal to me at all. My cats are my sanity pills. They've never morphed into other cats when my blood sugar is low, so they are a reference point that helps me get in touch with reality. <br>  <br>  The answer above is very good.

The danger is not injecting air, because you do NOT inject anything in this way, but the danger comes from possible infection and uncontrolled bleeding and/or bruising.<br>  <br>  I suppose that is IS possible, but I have never heard of a vet recommending that blood glucose testing be done in the home.  It is VERY difficult, even when you are trained and experienced.<br>  <br>  If your vet has indeed recommended that you do this, then return to the vet and have him SHOW you how it is done, and let you practice a few time in his presence, until you feel comfortable doing it alone.

84821087cda14dd0bdf6bd3bbda14952aa	Stop drinking and eating ANY so called DIET drinks or foods.  All those artificial sweeteners increase appetites.  The word "diet" is used very loosely in America and marketing types have learned the buzz words that get people to buy.<br>  <br>  Eating primarily carbohydrates is another way to increase your appetite.  Contrary to popular indoctrination of Americans, low fat foods cause your body to slow it's metabolism.  This is due to the way Leptin hormone is produced in your adipose tissue (stored fat tissue primarily).  This hormone sends a signal to the hypothalamus that you are starving.  We were designed to eat fat, not a lot of carbs.  In fact, primitive man ate mostly wild animals and wild fish, all of which contained lots of animal fats.   They are very little carbohydrates.  They all died with all their teeth and NO cavities and were very resistant to disease.  They lived long lives, contrary to the statisticians of today that are manipulating the data to prove we are living longer.  The more babies born, the more people, right?  O.K., if you look at the total number of people in the world, it is increasing.  This gives the appearance of all of us living longer.  It's a joke.  America has 53% of it's people with chronic illnesses according to the CDC report of 2005.  In 1905, the same CDC reported less than 5% chronically ill.  America is the sickest nation on earth now and we can thank the food and agricultural industries for this and the medical industry for allowing it to happen in the name of making huge profits.  <br>  <br>  Carbohydrates are like the kindling on a fire;  quick, fleeting energy that leaves you hungry within a short time.  Fats, on the other hand, give you long sustained energy, satisfy your hunger for long periods and provide the building blocks for many hormones, especially to the endocrine system of complex relationships in the body necessary for making hormones and antibodies.  Low Fat diets are dumb and simply BAD SCIENCE designed to put big bags of money into the food and agricultural industries and so called "Weight Loss Clinics."  <br>  <br>  If you will notice, all the people promoting "Low Fat" stand to gain economically from making you believe that indoctrination.  And as you will notice, they promote using vegetable oils that are one of the worst things you can put into your mouth.  Vegetable oils are very unstable and rancid when you buy them.   To mask the stench, the manufacturers put deodorizers in them so you won't smell it.  That strong odor you smell at Fat Food Restaurants is rancid oil.  People get so used to it, they think it smells good.  It's all designed to extract money from you at their low cost production.  It's not about health, but about profit for them.<br>  <br>  Also, many times that feeling of hunger is a hydration issue.  When your body is dehydrated, you will feel thirsty, but also hungry.  <br>  <br>  The average person needs water at the following rate:<br>  <br>  Take your total body weight and divide by 2.  That number is the amount of water in ounces that you need to drink each and everyday.  Along with that, you should consume 1/4 teaspoon of "air dried sea salt" in conjunction with each quart of water you drink.  This puts the electrolytes in your body that will give you proper hydration.  The typical white table salt you buy in stores like the Morton Salt, for instance, is terrible for you and has loads of chemicals added.  Avoid that junk.  If you drink ANY diuretic drinks like, sodas, coffee, tea, alcohol, commercially prepared fruit drinks, energy drinks, etc., these all dehydrate you and you will need to add more water to the total to compensate for the water loss due to these diuretic drinks.  Take the total ounces of the diuretic drinks and multiply by 1.5 and add that total to the original total to come up with the proper amount of water you need to drink each day.<br>  <br>  So, the best way to curb that appetite issue is to avoid ALL processed foods, ALL soy products (except for fermented ones), limit your carbohydrates to less than 75 grams per day, eat more good fats and lots of it, and get hydrated properly, and most of all avoid ALL drinks and foods containing artificial sweeteners.  If you want something to be sweet, add STEVIA.  Stevia is a plant that has been used as a sugar for centuries and contains NO sugar, NO calories, and is 30 times sweeter than sugar.  It is all natural and does not have the same effect as the artificial sweeteners.  It's a cheap substitute, so the FDA has rejected approving it for decades to protect the sugar substitute market, even though 25% of all sweeteners used in Japan for over 40 years or more has been Stevia with NO side effects of any kind.  In fact, you can buy stevia pills for improved health.  The more you learn about the FDA, the more you will realize it is NOT our friend in any way.<br>  <br>  good luck to you|`|zFb022Iiaa	I hear...<br>  Avoid caffeine<br>  Drink water<br>  Eat healthy small meals more often|`|MHMndoCcaa	Keep yourself busy and not bored, because when yur bored...it makes yu just wanta eat, and sumtimes people can mistake hunger for thirst...sumtimes i get really bored and i feel soooo hungry, but i drink sumthing and it fills me up barely, but im noot so hungry, or i just eat a little snack .....|`|4BE2ZSdZaa	eat sme almonds they reduce your appetite, drink pleanty of fluids, have a low calorie soup before your main meal then you wont eat so many calories|`|TWm5Smlaaa	drinking lots or water!

UZJ7wVc8aa	Getting a nice set of abs is such a misunderstood process. It's actually a lot easier than most people think which is why most people are in a never ending quest to get that perfect six pack - it's because they're doing all the wrong things.<br>  <br>  When you eat more calories than you burn, your body takes those extra calories and stores them as fat somewhere on your body. For some people, the #1 fat storage area is around the thighs and for others it might be around the stomach - it differs from person to person. Sometimes the fat is perfectly distributed around the body so it's not as big of a concern. <br>  <br>  If an excessive amount of fat is stored around your stomach, the reason that you're not seeing your abs is because your body fat percentage is too high. What you need to do is create a calorie deficit (take in less calories than you burn) so that your body is forced to use its fat stores for energy. After a few weeks of doing this, you'll notice that your abs will start to show.<br>  <br>  You first step is to figure out how many calories you burn each day. Use this calculator <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> for an estimate. Now you need to increase the amount of calories you burn by exercising more and decreasing the amount of calories you eat. Cut out junk food such as fast food, candy and sugar. Eat foods that are high in fiber: bread and pasta made from 100% whole wheat, brown rice, oats, fruits and vegetables.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't ignore targeting your abs with sit ups, leg raises and twists but doing hundreds of sit ups won't do anything about the layer of fat that is covering them. Cardio and calorie restriction should be your main focus.

XQ02V1u2aa	You would not believe all the things that anxiety can do to you. <br>  I was diagnosed with an GAD 4 years ago. <br>  <br>  You need to eat healthy. Even though you don't like it. sugars, and (ESPECIALLY) caffeine will make your anxiety worse. <br>  Anxiety can cause depression, fatigue, insomnia, and all sorts of weird things. <br>  <br>  You need to change your diet and exercise.<br>  That'd be the best thing you could do. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped. Here's a list of symptoms of anxiety: <br>  <a href="http://www.anxietycentre.com/anxiety-symptoms.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.anxietycentre.com/anxiety-sym...</a>|`|pBxLZFGzaa	Anxiety can totally cause this!!! What you need to do is schedule relaxation classes! I would advise yoga, MAYBE pilates, or any other nice thing to do. Maybe a massage once a week. You really just need to get rid of the stress that has built up inside of you for all of those years.<br>  <br>  It could be anxiety, or, it could be something called: The Emptiness Syndrome.<br>  <br>  If it's The Emptiness Syndrome, then the reason for your semi-depressed state  could be that you feel as if you've lost a huge part in your life. Are you coming close to the end of something, or did someone die in your family? Are you coming to a new experience that you don't exactly want to go through? If this is the case, then you need to think about exactly what it is that you feel you're going to miss or regret. Then, accept it. Say: "It's ok, I'll move one, and I'll live." Think about the greater things that will happen when you move on in your life, and think of how happy you and everyone else will become. You're 22, and coming to the end of your college, years, and I believe that's exactly what you feel bad about. If this is the cause, still go to yoga, (It healed my mother) and if you need it, talk to a psychiatrist, and they can help you get through your depression and anxiety, or emptiness. Good Luck, and I really do hope you feel better!|`|5e4Et035aa	holy crap! dude please dont do this to yourself! i dont no what i can say, uhm get a girlfriend, that is caring and understanding! and just stay with her! you'll become more happy|`|31SFWKNvaa	Definately could be anxiety.

wwRbkCMraa	Usually losing weight is simple numbers. You need to know your basic metabolic rate (BMR). Once you know your BMR then you can design a diet lower in calories than your BMR.<br>  <br>  But.... it is not always that simple. You could also have metabolic anomalies or even hormone irregularities that can make losing weight virtually impossible. <br>  <br>  Start with the simple stuff. Calculate your BMR right here <a href="http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calcul...</a>  then alter your diet if necessary.<br>  <br>  Now, if you don't see results after that you may look into the hormonal or metabolic areas. Also make sure you are being realistic, and that you do have weight to use. Don't forget... celebrities use tons of drugs and have personal trainers! We should all be so lucky 8)<br>  <br>  I have been doing the crossfit workouts and they have shredded my body big time (removed my body fat).

SQv8DGb7aa	I can recommend that you do something called "interval training"<br>  <br>  Although you are asking for something daily.. It doesn't mean because you work out daily, you get better results!<br>  <br>  Your body needs the rest in between these exercises and that will speed up get fitter and slimming down quicker!<br>  <br>  Whether you run,cycle,use a cross trainer or do rowing- this will definitely work for you. <br>  <br>  Try to do this interval 3 times a week. Thats it, nothing more than that. <br>  I have done this myself for the last 3 months and I look and feel great.<br>  <br>  Let me explain:<br>  <br>  1.Run (my preferred method) for 20 mins, every 2nd day. Start of with warming up for 5 minutes running at a 3/10 pace.( Working from a scale where 10/10 is the fastest you can go and 1/10 is almost walking)<br>  <br>  2. After your warm up, run a 8/10 pace for 1 minute and then return to a 3/10 pace for another minute.<br>  <br>  3.Continue doing these different paces until you get to your 16th minute( By now you would have done 5 fast intervals) and then you "cool down" for the last 5 mins (16th-20th minute) at a 2-3/10 pace. <br>  <br>  What you are basically doing is, forcing your body to work hard at adjusting all the time with the different speed levels and that leads to one thing- BURNING OFF MORE CALORIES!<br>  <br>  Do this only 3 times a week along side some healthy eating, and you will see results very quickly!!<br>  <br>  P.S <br>  You can also mix it up by instead of doing 1 minute fast, 1 minute slow for 5 intervals- to a 30 seconds fast and 1 1/2 minutes slow for your second week. Then return to your original exercise the following week. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!

It might be that you will need to be put on an antibiotic and given an inhaler to loosen whatever is affecting your breathing.|`|CeEnwf9Vaa	I will say that since you are not my patient and I have not examined you it is hard to say ....... however I would say that it is possible that you have pleuracy. This is fluid or air that collects around the lung in between the pleural sac in which the lung itself is contained. It is quiet painful and can take a long time to resolve. You will need to be on antibiotics for a while if this in fact is the issue. try steam baths and such to help loosen the phlegm and possibly some mucinex. It helps thin the mucous in your chest. Drink lots of fluids and do not sleep with a fan blowing right in your face.
HvH9X6ksaa	its not as big of a deal as how many calories that you are eating as it is where they come from    just try to eat more vegetables, fruit, but don't cut down on calories too much because that's not healthy    the best way to stay in shape is to work out. crunches, jump rope, and running are three very good ways to loose weight|`|Qj4zN2C4aa	Make sure you're not eating too much saturated fat + exercise more.<br>  Don't cut back on any more calories though, that could be dangerous.|`|UZJ7wVc8aa	If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn). <br>  <br>  Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.<br>  <br>  Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories. You can find some more information at the Beginner's Guide to Dieting - <a href="http://straightdiet.com" rel="nofollow">http://straightdiet.com</a>|`|wwRbkCMraa	Usually losing weight is simple numbers. You need to know your basic metabolic rate (BMR). Once you know your BMR then you can design a diet lower in calories than your BMR.<br>  <br>  But.... it is not always that simple. You could also have metabolic anomalies or even hormone irregularities that can make losing weight virtually impossible. <br>  <br>  Start with the simple stuff. Calculate your BMR right here <a href="http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calcul...</a>  then alter your diet if necessary.<br>  <br>  Now, if you don't see results after that you may look into the hormonal or metabolic areas. Also make sure you are being realistic, and that you do have weight to use. Don't forget... celebrities use tons of drugs and have personal trainers!

Z5q8CCIWaa	When you wake up in the morning you're a little stiff. During the day you loosen up. By the time its night you're about as loose as you can get. A subconscious factor may also come into play. During the day there are people out so you're more aware of how you look. You're alone at night, so that's not a problem anymore.<br>  Then of course the weather. Even though its cold day and night, its always colder at night. Heat is a huge limiting factor; its natural to have more energy at night.<br>  Lastly, if you're a teenager, then your internal clock has something to do with it. Adolescents have their peak energy at about two different times. From about 2pm-4pm and about 8pm-10pm.<br>  Of course, this doesn't apply to everyone, it's just the average teen.|`|72WcarmPaa	I am sure there is a reason for this and maybe more than one. <br>  <br>  Could have anything to do with the weather?<br>  <br>  Perhaps it is your internal clock, I know people how feel drowsy between 15-19 or but after that they fell just fine.<br>  <br>  Do you eat well for breakfast and lunch? That could be a factor, if your breakfast and lunch are small that could account for this, lack of energy!|`|HeAEMpCTaa	During the night, your legs actually get longer, not by much, but still longer. When you get up in the morning, they go back to their regular size. The increase in length probably helps you run faster.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!
GGjjtHmHaa	every woman puts out 1-2 unfertilized eggs a month in her parts, and once a month you bleed out for 3-8 days or how ever she bleeds, and that washes out the egg and replaces it with a new one. ALSO! one thing that is an important detail is that women ovulate 15 days after their period. meaning that 15 days after they finish bleeding, that's when they can have a baby, well....that's when their most likely to become preggo...<br>  hope i helped|`|D6p979QMaa	Menstruation is a woman's monthly bleeding. It is also called menses, menstrual period, or period. When a woman has her period, she is menstruating. The menstrual blood is partly blood and partly tissue from the inside of the uterus (womb). It flows from the uterus through the small opening in the cervix, and passes out of the body through the vagina. Most menstrual periods last from three to five days.|`|ttsn24hfaa	ok the eggs that exit your body are stored in your ovary and when its time for your period it starts slowly traveling through the fallopian tube and while it doing that your uterus is slowly building up a lining of blood so that if you get pregnate there is a cusion for the growing baby.if you arent pregnate your uterus sheds the blood and  and the egg along with it and this is called ovulation(your period)|`|wp5d4LmEaa	A period is a normal natural part of life. It is the thing that will allow for you to eventually become a mother. <br>  <br>  What will happen is usually for 4-7 days out of a month your body will release blood from your uterus thru your vagina. It is sometimes accompanied by some abdominal cramping.|`|qvH2JzcZaa	k well obviously u didn't take the science class that explained all this. haha lol. well when she goes into puberty a lining on the inside of her uterus builds up so that if she gets pregnant the baby will b alright. so when the egg didn't get fertilized and she didn't get pregnant the lining needs to go somewhere so it goes out the vag. and thats her period bud.|`|2K5Ebc38aa	Aww! Good for you, man.<br>  Its...Basically, the uterus of a woman, where the baby grows when she gets pregnant, sheds the inner lining. It comes out in the form of blood, through the vagina. It happens for around a week every month, its normal, but nooooooot pretty at all, unpleasant for the woman and the man she's with. XD|`|e7c3bba97d419b82754a63263dac1a5daa	Is a pain in the *** for women and girls,known as the curse cos eve ate the forbidden fruit, so now all women have to suffer this thing once a month!!|`|dcWN4v6Jaa	You should ask your mom. It's kinda a private thing for girls. Also don't make a girl annoyed when she has her period. We get mood swings and get mad easily. Well, a period is simply bad blood in our body getting out. So we buy these mini diapers of some kind. We get them every 6-8 weeks.|`|BRDqfAy3aa	discover everything below - menstrual cycle, period and more ...|`|IFGgQ99iaa	ok first, u use a lot of "lol"'s  :P <br>  a period comes once a month and is when blood comes out of your vagina. it lasts 3-7 days.  <br>  it comes when you are ready to have a baby. it usually starts at age 12, 13, or 14. <br>  hope i helped :)|`|dVzPKGGiaa	.................its uncomfortable|`|2cR8w61paa	Your 16 and u don't know???? wow and why would you want to know that????? you know Im not even going to explain it...|`|FAiN6rPfaa	why don't you ask yo mama

DMeKUJ6Saa	I think that it is great that you want to help your friend. <br>  <br>  You could both try losing weight together or doing it for charity. This is a great way to motivate him and encourage him to lose weight. <br>  <br>  Also he could try doing light exercise every weekend e.g. going on a 10 mile walk  (or a distance he can manage) and then stopping for a healthy picnic. This makes a great day out and it also provides exercise. <br>  <br>  Good luck!

MQ5Sq6wfaa	I have been a vegetarian for three years now.  I generally eat a lot of pastas and carbs, because I too find it difficult to incorporate vegetables into a lot of meals.  Isn't that funny that being a vegetarian it's still hard to eat enough vegetables?  haha.<br>  <br>  Here are some very fast and very cheap recipes I use from time to time:<br>  <br>  1. I personally LOVE to steam broccoli, squash and asparagus for about 10 minutes and grate sharp cheddar cheese on top with salt, pepper, and a bit of garlic powder.<br>  <br>  2. Vegetable soup with a cheese sandwich is always a nice choice.  You can buy some really nice vegetarian vegetable soups, but be careful to make sure it doesn't have beef in it, as some "vegetable" soups do.<br>  <br>  3. I make a mean fried rice.  Pick up a pack of fried rice seasoning from the asian section of your grocery store.  Cook about 3-4 cups of COOKED rice (so like 2 cups or so of dry rice), beat up 3 eggs, dice up about 4-5 stems of green onions, and cook 1 cup of frozen peas.  Also have some soy sauce and olive oil on hand.  Heat up some olive oil in a pan and put your cooked rice into the skillet with the chopped green onions.  Stir fry this until the onions start to look just a little brown.  Add the packet of seasoning and dash some soy sauce in with it, I generally put about 1/4 a cup or so, but you might like more or less.  Stir fry this for a minute or so, just to mix it in.  Push the rice to the side and scramble your eggs (I usually salt, pepper, and garlic powder the eggs while I beat them, and put a spoonful of butter in the skillet to pour them on top of.).  Mix in the scrambled eggs with the rice and then add the cooked frozen peas (to cook the peas you just put them in a microwave safe bowl and put in a little butter, salt, pepper and garlic powder).  Mix this all up and add some salt, pepper and garlic powder if you'd like.  You might need to add more soy sauce, just taste it and see what you think.  This is an excellent recipe, I promise you will love it.<br>  <br>  4. Shells and tomato juice: Tomato juice is a very good source of the nutrients we need from vegetables.  Steaming them tends to take away their value, so tomato juice is great here.  Buy a box or bag of shells (not small or large, just the regular ones) and cook them, then get a can of tomato juice (my parents can me some every year, but the store bought is decent).  Cook the pasta, drain, put over the tomato juice.  Salt, pepper and garlic powder to taste.  I usually use a lot of garlic powder here.  This goes great with a bit of garlic or texas toast.  If you are like me you can just toast regular bread and just add butter and garlic powder haha.<br>  <br>  5. Vegetarian chili: Get a medium size pot and mix in 1 large can of tomatoes.  You can use diced, but I prefer the larger chunks.  Mix in a can of tomato juice.  Add one can of black beans, and one can of kidney beans.  Add a packet of chili powder.  Serve with crackers or fritos and sharp cheddar.|`|06Rlukp7aa	I like to buy the marinades people use on meat and stir-fry vegetables in them. I like doing this with zucchinni, bok-choy, and bell-peppers. I also like cooking zucchini with spaquetti sauce, in a frying pan. The pre-peeled baby carrots are so convienant I usally keep them around. Nothing is simpler than a sandwhich. Healthy bread, spreads and your choice of veggies (cucumbers, tomatoes, etc.) are all you need to be good to go.|`|1eb4856ca6dd666139688d5134e04f8daa	Most people don't know how to use veggies so they avoid them altogether.<br>  <br>  One of my ex bf's used to steam asparagus stalks (cut 1" off the stem) and serve it with butter, mashed potatos and pork cutlets.<br>  <br>  Today I made a salad (great timing!) made of mustard greens and thinly sliced cabbage. <br>  <br>  Then I chopped red/orange/yellow small peppers into strips, crushed 6 garlic cloves and some fresh ginger into a mortar with a pistil, diagonally sliced 3 stalks of scallions, sliced up cooked chicken breast and tossed it into a bowl with fish sauce and a little lime juice. Then I tossed into non-stik pan with Stir Fry Oil (it's made of soybean oil/ginger/onion/garlic) and served hot over the greens with almonds.<br>  <br>  You could try going to NibbleDish.com and get some ideas, they're pretty creative there.|`|wwRbkCMraa	How bough smoothies... most are fruit, but you could improvise???<br>  <br>  Raspberry <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hektCX4zu9w" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hektCX4zu...</a><br>  Peanut Butter <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYIWANSZPww" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYIWANSZP...</a><br>  Strawberry <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUMuOyFpGh4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUMuOyFpG...</a><br>  Protein Ice Cream <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyKAY8J5XoE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyKAY8J5X...</a><br>  Pomegranate <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yIZE9lYTEc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yIZE9lYT...</a><br>  Oreo <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TQBhriecC0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TQBhriec...</a><br>  Tropical <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYNaY-jJ0RE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYNaY-jJ0...</a>|`|PUXmTrnMaa	I know this may sound stupid but if you really consider it, it makes sence....V8 juice.|`|BwJOeHDEaa	when i have bad day and we end up eating mac and cheese or hamburger helper (i know your vegitarian) or some other meal in a box..then ill add some brocolli or peas to the maccaronni and maybe a can of corn to the hamb helper, or ill make lettuce wraps..those are pretty good too, just pieces of lettuce and wrap up tuna, or humus, up and enjoy

qzVGaVWgaa	yea its not a scar the skin will renew itself in a week or two just keep it moist.  this happened when i had a band aid on my face and i stressed out too but it always resolves|`|PhS1xUw2aa	It will go away in a few days. The scar is probably from some lite blood or other fluid that connected to the gooey part of the band aid and caused them to stick together. And then, when you pulled the band aid from the abraission it stuck to the band aid and ripped the cut open. I believe you will be okay; apply some extra virgin oli oil to your sore and that will help speed the healing process. Olive oil is a wonderful aid to speed up the healing process. It provides a protective barrier from dirt and dust, keeps moisture on and lets air in to help with the healing. Try it and find out for yourself. Olice Oil is a wonderful source for the body. I pour a small bit in my hands daily and rub them together, I then rub into my hair and the rest on my face to provide wonderful enzyms into my skin! <br>  <br>  My friend says; use vaseline, and that is what I taught her sometime ago.

77936a89e6dfac91fabbe31c9176827aaa	Hi<br>  <br>  I don't think that the Doctor forgot something inside of you , is practically impossible that something like that happen without any other complication like fever or death . At this moment the scaring process is taking place and could take up to 18 weeks( usually between 12 and 16). Another possibility is an hernia. Just in case you should get an appointment with your Doctor to make sure that everything is OK.|`|AA10003191	It's likely scar tissue. Give the surgeon's office a call|`|NKurMFuTaa	It could very easily be scar tissue that's forming. The body goes through a long healing process after any kind of surgery, and four weeks is a very short amount of time to expect to be completely better. Give it time, especially if it's not causing any complications. There are many checkpoints and safeguards in place to ensure nothing is forgotten during surgery, and though it does happen, it is a very rare occurrence.
AA10451841	Hardness, or "induration" can just be from scarring, but it can also mean infection.  If you have pain, fever, chills or redness, or if you have any concern at all, pay your surgeon a visit or at least call the office.

JmdnlQsHaa	i think you look dead cool as you are.  but if you wanna gain muscle try eating more healthy carbs (eg brown bread, brown rice, wholemeal pasta), healthy protein (egg whites, lean fish, lean chicken/turkey) and lift weights 3 times a week, 2-3 sets of 6-8 reps, with a weight that makes it impossible for you to do 10 reps (so that your muscles will grow)

At least that's what I called it ;)<br>  You're pretty young, so the weight you're carrying will probably disappear in the next 2 or 3 years. But be careful. <br>  It's easier to gain weight than to lose it. Just get in enough exercise and drink your water. It sounds like you just need to gain muscle. You might be a little young to be able to gain a lot of muscle, but it won't be long. Just start now and when puberty comes around you'll bulk up a little more.<br>  Patience patience patience. Good luck!|`|HvH9X6ksaa	even if you think you are eating good, pay close attention to what kind of food u are eating, if u are getting enough protein, calcium, and carbs and that kind of stuff,  it helps to write it down.  try running   runing for long distances even if its more like jogging will help loose alot of weight|`|0ERZ9fkGaa	ur at normal weight
BGPuQsXuaa	It has actually been shown that when you jog or run outside, you use muscles that cannot be activated on a machine. I would recommend getting a treadmill to begin exercising. Remember that expensive is not always better. Overall, yes it is a good deal. But, I would recommend using it for those times you cant get outside like winter. Just remember outside is usually better. (Jump rope is probably the best cardio exercise.)

AA10003191	Essentially, plaque builds up in the coronary arteries. There are a multitude of factors involved.    Stress, smoking, diabetes, inflammation, cholesterol, etc.    Once the deposits reach a point, the heart tissue "downstream" doesn't get enough blood supply (ischemia). A heart attack follows (ischemic heart disease).|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	I would suggest a book titled "NO More Heart Disease" by Dr. Louis Ignarro.... he goes into the role nitric oxide plays in the pathophysiology of coronary artery disease.
u8CFwtyMaa	You don't need to stop, and certainly not stop for a year.  Lots of married men masturbate, it only becomes a problem if it is done in preference to sex.  From personal experience, I found that my sexual needs are not always in sync with that of my wife, and masturbation is far more preferable to having an affair.  Masturbation does teach you how your body responds to stimulation, and how to control yourself, so from that point of view, it's worth continuing.  Hope this helps.|`|xJes6VL9aa	whats wrong with masturbation? everyone dose it from young kids just experimenting to old people. it dose not make you any worse than anyone else. if you ask anyone and they say they never tried it their a lier.    keep it up, the feelings great :)|`|IM3QwSS2aa	masturbating will NOT reduce the need to have sex.  some people use it as a replacement and don't seek outside relationships. and it certainly doesn't increase the control over sex.    /jerome|`|H2IqzG12aa	Masturbating is just a substitute for sex.  On any given day, you do one or the other.  I doubt that you could go a year without masturbating in anticipation of marriage.

Z5q8CCIWaa	Not everyone gets heart burn, and hot sauce isn't a big cause of it, contrary to popular belief.<br>  It's caused by stomach acid escaping from your stomach. The flap that holds food in your stomach sometimes fails and stomach acid can travel up your esophagus (the tube shaped organ running from the back of your mouth to your stomach) and burn the lining. Heart burn has nothing to do with your heart, really.<br>  It's mostly caused by eating too much, being overweight, bad posture, or wearing pants that squeeze your waist too hard.<br>  It doesn't need to be treated by a doctor unless you're in severe pain. You can get over the counter medicine to ease the pain, or just tough it out.<br>  <br>  The people that say you'll get heart burn probably say that because hot sauce can make heart burn worse. For example, you might eat an apple and get heart burn, or you might eat jalapenos and get heart burn.<br>  Of course, the spicy food will hurt worse.|`|onbwN4csaa	Your young just wait You will soon see. it's like fire in the throat mostly when you lay down.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ha ha ha ha <br>  The fun you have to look forward to.<br>  Between the farting and the squirting the burping and the burn.<br>  Don't make fun of us just yet. soon it's your turn.<br>  Again  Ha Ha Ha.|`|o6HB29o8aa	its wen your throat feels like its on fire and nothing you do will get rid of it. its your stomach acid going into your esophogus. tums get rid of it|`|AA12148432	Heartburn is a common occurrance in a lot of people.  Sometimes it occurs because of something they eat and other times they have a disorder that causes it more often.  If you eat hot sauce a lot and you don't feel a burning when you burp or a kind of burning in your chest under your sturnum (the bone that runds down the center of your chest)  I wouldn't be too concerned about heartburn.  If you do get heartburn, you'll know it.  You'll "vurp" a little and it will burn and sometimes your stomach will feel like it's on fire.  It's usually taken care of by taking an anti-acid, like Tums or Rolaids or Maalox.  I wouldn't worry too much about it, especially if you're young.|`|Sj2hZSgIaa	it's whenyou tell little kids they're fat

MQ5Sq6wfaa	I think you should just take a thorough bath, and then drain the water and take a quick shower to make sure you got everything off.  Clean any cuts and scrapes with rubbing alcohol, not peroxide.  Don't let your mind trick you into thinking you have something wrong when you don't... look for real symptoms, don't just blow something small out of proportion.  <br>  <br>  The only major concern you should worry about is sewage run-off in the water.

SjHDAhgDaa	20mg of accutane a day for 6 months, the second u start, there will be no more break outs, unless u get the initial flare up, but thats gone in a week, then its no more breakouts, jsut old acne going away :)|`|3u4HU7rdaa	1. Use a gentle face cleanser. No a cleanser is not soap. Soap can dry and irritate the skin which can lead to breakouts which you hardly want. Gentle is the keyword here so use a gentle cleanser twice daily without scrubbing or hard rubbing. A good cleaning routine can help keep your pores clear and clean. If you think that cleaning your face more often will mean it will be cleaner your wrong. Cleaning your face too often can cause more irritation and breakouts so be patient if you are currently facing a breakout as more cleaning won't clear your skin quicker. When washing your face it is a good idea to use warm water to rinse.<br>  <br>  2. You have probably heard this a million times before from your parents but don't pop, pinch or squeeze your pimples. While you want to get rid of the visible signs of your acne as quickly as possible popping them or squeezing them isn't going to do you or your skin any long term good. Not only can it lead to scarring which can be just as worse as having breakouts but it can also irritate your skin leading to further breakouts and the cycle begins again. If you have the urge to pick or squeeze your pimples the simple answer is don't.<br>  <br>  3. Use medication. If you are suffering from regular acne breakouts and the regular acne treatments you find at the local drug store not helping then you will want to consider seeking medical advice. Doctors will be able to assess your acne condition and prescribe suitable acne medication ranging from topical solutions to anti-bacterial drugs. Doctors can also refer you to a dermatologist which can work with you to prevent acne breakouts.<br>  <br>  4. Use sun protection at all times. With the use of medication to help control your acne you are going to be susceptible to the sun and be more sensitive then usual. You will want to always put on a good quality sunscreen before leaving home and to reapply during the day to help protect your skin. When picking a sunscreen look for ones that are oil free for sensitive skins. Wear a hat whenever possible to help shield your face from direct sun exposure and avoid being in the sun for extended periods like at the beach or sitting in the park. There are myths that suggest sun exposure can help reduce your acne breakouts, as far as medical evidence goes there is no supporting study to suggest that sun exposure has any links to the reduction of acne and at worse may even lead to increasing your likelihood of skin cancer so don't risk it.<br>  <br>  5. Exercise regularly. You should be trying to exercise regularly each week anyway for overall health and vitality but exercise can also assist with reducing your acne breakouts. Exercise has long been known to help reduce stress and anxiety and this will help reduce acne as one of the causes can often be due to heightened stress levels. Exercising also serves to help cleanse your pores through sweating but you need ensure that you wipe of excess sweat and try to have a shower after strenuous exercise. <br>  <br>  Water is keen to healthy skin. Drink as many as eight glasses of water, which help in improving the tone and texture of the skin. It is also known that water stimulates cell growth and filters out unwanted substances that could harm the skin.<br>  <br>  A healthy diet goes a long way in maintaining a healthy skin and in preventing breakout of the skin. Fruits, green vegetables, grains and nuts should be included more in the diet. Avoid excess oil in the diet. Excess oils are known to clog pores that can lead to the breakout of the skin.<br>  <br>  <br>  those are some tips. hope i helped. by the way if jenny is your real name, it's mine too. xD|`|OleVPkJgaa	try some acne systems like proactive or acne complex.<br>  and DO NOT stop treating your skin after the first break out is gone. Treat you whole face and keep going even if you think you wont break out again.|`|SCeIOtZpaa	it's a great idea to use a great skin care product everyday to keep the chance of breakouts at it's lowest.  I really like proactive solutions.

Twice a day is a good balanced amount that wont dry out your face.
KSUPtqCaaa	If you feel comfortable speaking about such things with your gynecologist, than go right ahead and ask; but you may only end up being referred to a urologist. It sounds like you have stress incontinence, which is believed to be more common, especially among females.<br>  <br>  That said, you should speak to a doctor about this! You will want to make sure there are no underlying conditions to worry about.<br>  <br>  You should also look into performing Kegel exercises, which are designed to help strengthen some of the muscles that provide bladder control.

I dont believe its incontinence, because with that you have to wear a diaper (i work at a nursing home). i'm sure it is more to do with your actual urinary bladder, not with your urethra or ureters. but hey i'm no expert :D
BTI0XOptaa	You don't need to worry too much. If you haven't got an infestation, don't go treating yourself with pesticide treatments. Not only is this an overwhelmingly drastic measure, chemical head lice treatments are not meant to work in this way.<br>  <br>  Get yourself some tea tree oil from your local health food store and mix 10 drops of it in with some water into a spray bottle. You can also mix it with some leave in conditioner. This will repel any live lice. Straighten your hair with a hot iron, this will pop any nits.<br>  <br>  You really don't have to worry too much about it until you find live lice in your hair. Until then take these prevention methods and you should be fine.<br>  <br>  If you have an infestation, please see the following website for more articles and information.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|G0qsVfoUaa	Get a lice comb, has really tiny fine teeth, and if you have them they will show up with combing. <br>  You can get them even if you didn't "touch heads" and sometimes they just get going around, like in schools.<br>  Get your parents to check, or get them to go buy you the special shampoo just to be safe.|`|XU5SVQZDaa	Take mayonnaise-cover your head with plastic bag for over 8hrs-the lice can hold their breaths for this long (my daughter told me this-she has 2 kids-sounds amazing to me) and then the nits wil just slide off the hair shaft.

SjZ2lgQyaa	A part of your brain, called the hypothalamus does for your body what a thermostat does for your house -- it controls the temperature. When you are sick, the hypothalamus may decide that to fight the illness, your temperature should be higher than<br>  the normal 98.6 degrees, say 103 degrees. Since your temperature is really 98.6, your hypothalamus makes you begin to feel cold, which creates shaking chills, tiny muscle movements that together are like your muscles running in place. This starts to warm your body and won't stop until your temperature reaches 103 degrees. <br>  <br>  When your fever begins to come back down, you may begin to sweat heavily. This is the body's way of cooling itself off.|`|R50qiFKHaa	yes.

Also you want to make sure you are changing up the types of exercises you do for each muscle group. This is very important, because your body will respond more rapidly to an ever changing routine.

Well um...<br>  To be quite honest, vaginas aren't exactly meant to smell like flowers or taste like chocolate, my boy XD<br>  <br>  If it smelled abundantly fishy or like rotten eggs, that's an issue.

xjp3rHcDaa	your first facial hairs are always thin, and light colored, but after a certain amount of time, they get thicker, and darker.|`|rwXcLTNvaa	What age are you. If you are under 18, they are whitish but as you grow out of puberty they will darken and go black.|`|AIsvSsEKaa	Great Question. Most of us guys have asked the same thing. I started shaving every day (with full beard) when I was 14. My brother didn't shave until he was 20. There are a lot of things that explain how our facial hair grows in. <br>  <br>  On average a young guy starts growing facial hair around 15 to 16 years of age. Because boys start puberty at different ages and progress at different rates, it is considered normal to have facial hair as young as 11 or to not start developing facial hair until as late as 17. <br>  <br>  You need to consider genetics as well. Some men, such as those native of the Philippines, have very little body hair and almost no facial hair. Others, such as northern Europeans, have an abundance of body and facial hair. Even if you inherit the genes for lots of facial hair, all the hair follicles on your face do not develop at once. They will come in a little at a time, giving you a scraggly look.<br>  <br>   Generally, facial hair first shows up on the upper lips, near the chin, and beside your ears. It then spreads across the face thinly and then fills in thicker. It takes several years after facial hair first appears before you will be able to grow a full, thick beard.<br>  <br>  Maybe you don't want to hurry it. Shaving your face can be expensive and can hurt sensitive skin. I hope this answer helps.|`|k23GYs9iaa	my boyfriend says he couldn't grow a nice mustache or  a beard with no missing patches until he was about 23.

xCCyGtv2aa	I personally hate the way people look when they get all that work done.

Think of all the things you are able to do and all of the wisdom you probably have that someone half your age can't even fathom.  I think it's beautiful to get older.   I really like seeing older women--even elderly women--who are comfortable in their own skin.<br>  <br>  There's nothing wrong with wanting to achieve a healthy weight.  If you are overweight, it is ok to ask your doctor about healthy ways to take off some pounds.  But you say you are concerned about a recurrence of some body image problems.  I don't know your history, but if you have ever suffered from an eating disorder, or body dysmorphic disorder, or any other psychological issue for that matter, please contact your therapist before things get out of hand.  <br>  <br>  Best wishes--and happy birthday!

u0AmiATbaa	I think a dietitian is someone that helps you to loose weight, possibly by planning meals, making exercise plans etc, whereas a nutritionist  helps you to eat more healthily and isn't just about helping you losse weight.  I think they want to help you to eat a balenced diet to keep you healthy.  Dietitians, however, are only there to help you loose weight.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

c7KCto2Raa	um yes, building muscle is all about timing. You should use creatine 30 minutes before your actual workout and 30 minutes after your workout. Timing is essential to what your making of yourself. For example I take my post workout 30 mins before my workout, then my protein shake right after I workout and then my postworkout recovery shake after that. Later I take my vitamonis to restore my lost nutrients and then I take some supplments before I go to bed to enhance my recovery even more.

1PXkhhzQaa	About 2 to 6% of men have early complications from vasectomy including infection, excess bleeding, or hematoma (a big blood clot). These complications frequently scare the heck out of many men and cause anxiety.<br>  <br>  Infection usually responds to antibiotics in about a week, if the infection is minor and doesn't involve a hematoma. The doctor should have explained all this to you. Rarely, a hematoma has to be evacuated (removed surgically) or infection develops an abscess that can require drainage. These are rare occurrences, but clearly very distressing to the affected patient.<br>  <br>  I would say: rest, drink lots of fluids, report any fever >100.5 to the doctor, and watch for any worsening redness or swelling, or pus from the incision. <br>  <br>  You should be in close contact with the surgeon until you are completely healed. Luckily, for most men, these acute complications are not associated with any long-term problems.|`|NhWvvJ4saa	Wow, you were unlucky to get an infection, but the drugs should clear it up in about 4-5 days,and you will think of it as nothing when the hairs start to grow back,AAAAAAAAAGH.|`|cr2KKT6Naa	staff infection. where did you have it done. in a dirty alley. i hope you can save your nuts . you might want to get yourself an attorney. some doctor could get sued.|`|0926fb090779ea655b04d01fb5402513aa	I think you might have just learned a lesson about following directions.  If you did, then you went to a doctor’s office with some pretty lame infection control procedures.  <br>  <br>  The situation you are facing is rare.  The good news is it will get better, and you are going to live.  I knew a few other men this happened to.  Yup they whined a bit, but they got over it.  They laughed about it after they got better.  I do not remember exactly, but I think it took about two weeks to clear up 100%.<br>  <br>  No matter how painful the infection it pales by comparison to an inner ear infection.

If you feel uncomfortable take it off<br>  2. put some ice on the testicle for 30 minutes every day<br>  3. rest and dont  left more than 15 pounds<br>  4. dont do sexual activities tell you are fine  <br>   thankss hope you are all right <br>  5. be in contact with your (doc)|`|iQYGl0oZaa	the fact that you started treatment on the2nd raises a red flag. you should have definitely seen improvement by now.i had a vasectomy some years ago and every year experience discomfort in the epiditimus where they left in the metal clips.you might be allergic to the metal if they left your in, even though its surgical steel,some peoples bodies reject anything foreign.the fact that its still swollen would indeed warrant a return trip to the doctors office...edit:i misread your post, you started treatment on the 20th?, it usually takes about a week to see real results with an antibiotic.|`|4jYg8k0Qaa	Make sure they're prescribing one of the floxacin antibiotics like Cipro or Levaquin.

xmibEEdcaa	Are you a new smoker?  (If so, then dude! Don't do it!  I've been smoking for over 20 years now, and trying to quit is HELL ON EARTH. If you gotta do the nicotine, get yourself one of those electronic cigarettes instead. Cheaper, cooler, and much better for you - plus, you can smoke it in bars and restaurants.)<br>  <br>  Anyway, if you're new to smoking, then I can think of two things that might be causing it.  It could be a repetitive stress injury like carpal tunnel, because you're holding your cig in some weird way that puts stress on some nerve in your hand, arm, or shoulder.  Try holding your cigarette a different way and see if that fixes it.<br>  <br>  Second, you could be having a bad reaction to one of any number of nasty chemicals in your cigarettes.  Smoking changes both your circulation and your blood pressure, and either one of those could cause your fingers to feel weird.<br>  <br>  If you're a long-time smoker, then although it would be a little weird for this problem to suddenly show up, it could still be the cumulative effect of raised blood pressure and reduced circulation.  Or, it could be the first signs of arthritis, which is only triggered for you when you hold your fingers in just the right position to hold a cigarette.<br>  <br>  If it gets worse, I'd go see a doctor. In the meantime, hold your cigarette differently and see if that helps any.  And if you can cut down on the cigs (knowing how hard it is to quit, I'm not going to tell you to just quit, but see if you can cut down a little), that might be a good idea too, just so you can get an idea if it's the crap in the cigarettes themselves that's causing the problem.|`|sOTRIqLCaa	maybe its trying to stop u from killing ur self huh?|`|ngt2B4QOaa	Could be carpal tunnel.|`|YvuCN6qWaa	Most likely due to your smoking of course..

Slow is the way to go.<br>  <br>  If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn). <br>  <br>  Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.<br>  <br>  Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories.

I'd say the best thing is to make sure she's eating healthy foods, and to enroll her in a very active sport: martial arts, track team, soccer, swimming, something like that.  Sports have other good side effects, like improving teens' attitudes and teaching time management and teamwork.  You should also have her start helping to cook dinners, and have her start to pack her own lunch to bring to school.  This will educate her about nutrition and food in general, and she'll also take some personal accountability for her food choices.

Eventually changing the way you eat. Figure out how many points you get a day and then eat what you want, just stay under that figure. For example, I get 29 points a day. A normal slice of pizza is probably like 4 or 5 points. Also, work out. Lift weights. Cardio is the quickest way to fall off of a diet. It's repetitive and the more you do it the less effective. Build muscle and burn exponentially more calories.|`|cCo0Ivisaa	1) Don't eat allot of junk food.

Your bones need phosphorus, calcium, and magnesium while your muscles need water, protein and carbohydrates to grow. Since you are growing taller, both your muscles and bones are getting bigger and longer. Don't waste your money or your health on drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.<br>  <br>  Have the hair style that makes you appear taller. In order to appear taller, a hair style should be thin at the sides and higher up top, which can make you appear as much as an inch taller Avoid clothes with horizontal lines. Belts are horizontal so make sure you conceal it in your clothes.<br>  Avoid clothes with a tartan or checked pattern. Avoid cuffs that makes your legs appear shorter.<br>  <br>  ? Wear clothes with vertical lines or striping. Vertical lines or stripping make a person appear thinner,<br>  and thinness in turn gives impression of more height.<br>  <br>  Wear shoes that will make you appear taller. If you are a female, this should be easy since you can find a lot of female shoes with 2 or 3 inches’ heels. For males, wear shoes with thick soles to add the illusion of height.<br>  <br>  To increase your height, it is important that your blood is oxygenated as blood provides nourishment to your bones. Regular breathing will also purify your blood. There are three phases to breathing:<br>  1. Inhaling - take in air into your body through the nose<br>  2. Retaining - hold your breath inside your body<br>  3. Exhaling - blow out air from your body through the mouth<br>  <br>  It is during deep sleep that growth hormone does its job of thickening and lengthening your bones. So appropriate sleeping time (not the longer, the better) and correct sleeping posture is very important for your body to grow. Sleep is defined as a natural periodic state of rest for the mind and body, in which the eyes usually close and consciousness is completely or partially lost, so that there is a decrease in bodily movement and responsiveness to external stimuli.<br>  <br>  During deep sleep, growth hormone produced by your pituitary gland is released into your blood stream and travel through your body and causes the thickening and lengthening of your bones. Therefore, you should achieve "deep level" sleep on a daily basis in order to coordinate your affords of exercises and proper diet. The following are some helpful tips on how to easily achieve deep level sleep.<br>  <br>  Sleep in a comfortable and firm mattress.<br>  Sleep in a room that is dark, quiet and fresh smelling.<br>  Sleep with clean, soft, and comfortable clothes.<br>  Keep your hands and feet warm. Scientific studies have shown that warm hands and feet will help induce REM (rapid eye movement) deep sleep. Cold hands and feet will keep you from deep sleep.<br>  Drink a big glass of water before going to bed and when you wake up; this will help clean out your system.<br>  Practice total relaxation and deep breathing for a few minutes before you go to bed.<br>  Relax from head to toe. Close your eyes and relax every part of your body.<br>  Maintain a habit of sleeping at the same time everyday, including weekends.<br>  Sleep on your back with a flat pillow under your knees. This will align your spine properly and prevent any back aches caused by sleeping in a bent position.<br>  <br>  Undoubtedly, the quality, quantity, and type of food we eat affect our height, growth, and health. We cannot emphasize enough how important your food intake is in determining how much growth you can possibly obtain. The types of food you eat will either improve or decrease your growth potential.<br>  After careful consideration and research, the daily content of protein, carbohydrates, fats and water can be achieved if the following items were taken regularly.<br>  <br>  Carrots Fish Liver<br>  Egg Yolk Beef Red Meat<br>  Milk Cheese Apples<br>  Green Vegetables Potatoes Nuts<br>  Yellow Vegetables Almonds Bananas<br>  Peanuts Chicken Beans<br>  Peas Salt 6-8 glasses of water per day<br>  <br>  If you eat a lot of peanut butter, your height will not necessarily stop. Neither does masturbation stop height.<br>  What might stop you from growing is smoking, drugs, alcohol, lack of sleep, stress, digestive problems, or lack of exercise.<br>  <br>  Height Growth Products : The first approved natural product for height increase is Super-Growth <a href="http://www.super-growth.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.com</a> or <a href="http://www.super-growth.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-growth.org</a> with this product it is possible to gain additional height growth even after puberty.<br>  I love Super-Growth . I've been using it as a height booster for several months now This stuff is great, It is rare for a product to live up to its advertised hype. But this one actually does. It Works as advertised. Also, this specific product advertises improved joint health. I injured my knee and could find no relief, but after 3 weeks of using the Super-Growth I no longer have knee pain. I have tried other height gaining products, but I have seen the best results from this product. My height continues to grow .

BWxSSADaaa	When I was your age I had a bit of weight to lose too, and I wanted to start getting stronger because I was going to start swim team soon.  I started doing calisthenics: jumping jacks, pushups, crunches, lunges, squats.  If you do some calisthenics for 20 minutes every day, you will see results.  It's even better if you can buy a couple of dumbells and a jump rope.  With weights, you can do bicep curls, tricep kickbacks, dumbell rows, shoulder presses and flies.  You can also hold the weights while doing leg exercises.  Jump roping is a great activity too, to get your heartbeat going.  <br>  <br>  I would do a warm up of jumping rope for 10 minutes, starting slow and speeding up.  Then do strength exercises.  Don't do the same exercises every day, there are a lot of choices so you can work different muscles, or work your muscles differently, on different days.  Do a strength routine for about 20-30 minutes.  Then I'd finish up with a 20 minute stretching or yoga routine.  That worked well for me, even though it's not 90 minutes.  If you want another great workout, try swimming at an indoor pool if there is one available.|`|ncvoaDIFaa	Medicine balls are good to work out with. You can look on youtube to find some good workouts with a medicine ball. Also those bouncy balls filled with air you can buy at wal mart for cheap are good for abs. If you put one behind your back and do crunchies, it works very well.
UZJ7wVc8aa	If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn). <br>  <br>  Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.<br>  <br>  Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories.

I had no withdrawal symptons.  Relax if you can and trust your doctor and be honest with him/her about how you feel so they can determine if the medicine is a good fit.  There are definitaly non medication ways to deal with anxiety.  Look into cognitive behavioral therapy.  Good luck.|`|Snat5Hlpaa	i took it for about 1.5 years. <br>  <br>  i stopped taking it, because of side effects, and every evening , i get light headed, irritable, brain zaps for these past 2 weeks. believe everything you read on withdrawal symptoms. it is *****terrible. it might be my depression coming back, but withdrawal makes it much worse, i feel extremely stressed, suicidal at times. lexapro can also raise cortisol levels.<br>  <br>  my advice, stop taking it. you can either try an ssri with longer half life elimination to avoid SSRI discontinuation syndrome, or natural ways like diet, exercise, being health conscious. or a damn good therapist/ psychologist|`|6w7FKrlfaa	i was on lexapro for quite a while before zoloft.  neither of them really help me.  it's a trial and error thing.  just keep going back to your doctor.  your body has to adjust.  5 days isn't long. give it time.
ZuYTZ80Gaa	I know women on depo can lose their periods and then have a heavy bleed afterwards.  It can definitely be nerve wracking but it's just what happens sometimes.  Sometimes physicians will prescibe some oral estrogen to try to "clean up the uterus" a bit along with the depo when this happens.|`|Eec9JeXbaa	hmm. the signs are definitely pregnancy like..but the cramps seem more like when I was miscarrying..  <br>  <br>  I'd incline more to the pregnancy though..  achey, and tired, peeing all the time..yep..
