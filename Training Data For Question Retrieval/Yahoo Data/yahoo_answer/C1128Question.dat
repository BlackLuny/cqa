20090223160431AAa4sta	Beauty & Style;Hair	Dyeing your hair without it being permanent?	So lately (the past year or two) i've been getting really really sick of my hair colour. It's blonde, but kind of a dirty/strawberry blonde. I've been thinking of dying it, but i don't want to dye it so it's permanent because then you just have to keep dying it and dying it. My sister has used some stuff that is supposed to wash out in a certain number of washes, i beleive it was Herbal Essences. It didn't some out the exact colour it said it would, quite a bit darker but it was still a nice colour. It's supposed to be 'demipermanent' meaning it just fades out, but it hasn't completely faded out yet and it's been quite a few months. So i was wondering if anyone knows if there is hair dye out there that is actually 'demipermanent' so that will fade out completely, because i really don't want to permanently dye it. I live in Canada by the way and i know there are hair dyes you can buy at Hot Topic but we don't have Hot Topic here, if that helps anyone. If anyone knows of anything that would be great, thanks! :)

20090223160235AA2yuZz	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	How to walk in heels well?	I'm in 9th grade and the only other time i've worn heels is for homecoming and winter formal dances. I wore the same heels for both that are 2 1/2 in. heels. For my friend that is a sophomore, for her sweet sixteen we are going in a limo and to eat and stuff and everyone is dressing up. I got this really cute pink dress to wear and I got Coach brand heels that were $150.00. I had a gift card for $200.00 and I personally don't like coach purses for multiple reasons. So I bought a wallet and these heels so dont go on and on saying that 150 is too much to spend on a pair of heels that I will only wear a few times. And, I HAVE to wear them. They are black and have the same exact color pink "C's" on them as the pink in the dress and pink bows at the front and they are pointy! (They are so cute!! I love them ;] )   Here's where the problem come in, They are 5 1/2 inch heels :0.   I am good at walking in heels and Im good with the 5 1/2 inch, but there is 30 people going to this party in the Hummer Limo and half of them are guys and they are all going to be dressed up and everything and all the other girls will and I judt broke up with my boyfriend and am really looking for someone new and I really don't want to fall flat on my face. Can anyone help me overcome this fear?!   Not wearing them is not an option, they match perfectly and are expensive and my legs look good in them and just someone help?

I'm talking WITHOUT putting anything in the hair - no lemon juice or none of the stuff.  Just sunshine alone.  Can 30 mins to an hour in the sun already start to lighten it? If not, how many days would it take to start to notice it becoming slightly lighter? (BTW, I live in very high elevation at 7,000 feet, so the sun is about 35% more intense than the sun is at sea-level.)

20081007075807AAZWfzR	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Ladies...(And Gentlemen)...Need Your Feedback with Regards to Salon/Stylist Manners?	To make this short and to the point, I found a stylist via a commercial. Liked what I saw and called for my appointment. This was 8 months ago. Well, I am a very generous tipper. The stylist I was going to was struggling, yet she did a fantastic job with styling and treating hair. So I felt she was worthy of a nice tip. At any rate,over time, I felt as if that was what she was expecting from me each time I made appointments. So, in the end, I decided to do some watchful waiting. She would try to sell me these package deals with each visit (for example, the package would cost $350.00-$500.00 which would be good for anywhere between 3-5 months of service). So when you went for your appointment, you wouldn't pay the fees. I still tipped generously (sometimes up to $100). I finally declined her offer. She then goes on to say that I should make weekly appointments. I also kindly declined. Next, she moves on to say that I should try new conditioning products on my hair (my hair is very healthy and medium in length). I gave in and she charged me a crap load for trying out this new conditioner. I said to myself "That's it." In the end, I told her I would no longer be coming to her studio. She says "You need a special shampoo/conditioner that we only sell". I never went back, Was she money hungry Fellow Yahoo'ers? Thanks guys!

20081010124537AA41lgG	Beauty & Style;Hair	If you dye your hair too much, does it go grey and white?	My friend, she went to the hairdressers every couple of months to get red streaks put in her hair. It looked awesome - although, she had grey streaks in her hair.      My friends brother; dyes his hair constantly with hair packages from the local shops. He has patches of white hair.      - I'm really worried. I'm only 14 years old - and I'm going to have grey or white hair? What?   Okay, ready? This is how the story goes.      When I was about 9 or 10, I had blonde streaks put in my hair. Then at 11-12, I dyed my hair black. Then I dyed it blonde about 5 months later, although it turned out bright crayon orange. Then; I tried to dye it blonde again, but it came out orange again. So then; about 4 weeks later I dyed my hair brown - still orange. I dyed my hair twice after that; and the second time I dyed my hair brown; it turned out brown (finally). About 2 months later - I dyed my side frindge completely blonde. I wasn't happy with the result; therefore I toned it. Then it came out ashy blonde, so I went to my local priceline and I got hair bleach. My hair came out blonde, I was happy. But not as good as I thought it should've came out. So I dyed it with the bleach again, like two days later. Then again, probably a day later.      Now, I'm really scared. My roots are greyish brown - I'm not too sure though;  my hair hasn't grown enough for me to tell.      Okay, the question I'm supposed to be asking is; if you dye your hair too much, when you dye it, will it straight away go grey? Or will your roots turn grey? Please; I need answers quick.      I'm really scared.   And if thats the case - then how do I get my hair back to my natrual colour again? Thanks. X

When I put on my tie, the tip of the wider part of my tie is around the button of my pants (I guess it's where it suppose to be). However, the tip of the narrow part of my tie (the tail) is hanging longer than the wider part.   So, if you look from the front, you can see the narrow part of my tie hanging lower than my belt.   Did I tie it wrong or did I buy the wrong tie?   What should I do? is there a way to get around this problem without have to buy a new tie?   I'm 5'9" tall and my tie is a regular sized tie.

So my problem is that in the morning when i apply my makeup, ( eye shadow , eye linner , mascara ), my makeup is prefect and i have NO DARK CIRCLES. But then later in the afternoon lets say at about 3pm i look in the mirror and my eye linner faded away and i have dark circles ? But if i DONT wear eye linner then those dark circles dont appear ? so im guessing that the eye linner fades away in my skin ?      So my question is, What is a GOOD eye linner that wont cause that but is still not too expensive ?

My hair is flippy, like, at the end it flips out and I hate it.  But I don't like taking the time to straighten it, but I guess that I will, anyways.
