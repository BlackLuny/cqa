srVQ1tTLaa	Goodie, goodie, a question about whiskey, my favorite drink.<br>  <br>  I have had K.D. and Evan Williams as well as a host of others. In my opinion, you cannot compare these two, they are too different. <br>  <br>  First off, Evan Williams is a straight whiskey, and K.D. starts out as a straight whiskey, but is blended with a grain alcohol (everclear, basically) for some reason. I used to drink it until a friend called it Kill 'em Dead, and pointed out that blended fact.<br>  <br>  As far as K.D. being referred to as a Crown knock off, I don't see it at all. <br>  <br>  Evan Williams is an OK whiskey, but there are a few out there that cost about the same, and taste better, in my book. <br>  <br>  One such whiskey is Old Heaven Hill. Not regular Heaven Hill, but look for Old Heaven Hill. The difference is the proof, or alcohol content, and the fact it is bottled in bond, since it is 100 proof. It is not too readily available, but I live in Arlington, Texas and there are a couple of places nearby that stock it. If you are looking for a knock off to Jack, then this is your stuff! It is charcoal filtered, just like Jack, then charcoal mellowed, just like Jack. The result is a better taste, and by the way, did I mention it was 100 proof?!<br>  <br>  Call around, and check to see who carries it in your area. If you can't find it, email me, and I will send you a bottle. I should be a salesman for them!|`|evEJxv06aa	go and try the reviews at liquor-snob.com|`|18d121d01c136ac0f12ff28e4139c812aa	try reviews:<br>  <a href="http://www.liquorsnob.com/archives/2006/02/evan_williams_black_label_bourbon_review.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.liquorsnob.com/archives/2006/...</a>
Rzho75Ssaa	You'll NEVER make my dog vegetarian!! By God!<br>  <br>  Why are you up so late - were you at the Hue & Cry concert..?|`|JVWFQZrSaa	Yes of course !! Dogs are omnivores, they like us do not need to consume animal flesh to live.<br>  <br>  The longest lived dog was vegetarian and the oldest dog at the moment is vegan <br>  <br>  "A border collie said to be 27 could make it into the Guinness Book of World Records as the world's oldest living dog.The owner says she feeds her a vegan diet of rice, lentils and organic vegetables."<br>  <br>  My own dog is vegetarian and his vet says he is in excellent health!|`|jZRtTpZiaa	Domesticated dogs are omnivorous.  Consult with your veterinarian about any dietary decisions, rather than rely on advice from an online forum when it comes to something as important as the health of an animal. <br>  <br>  I do think it's odd when people scream about how they would never give their dog anything but meat,  at the same time they are giving them a scoop of pellets out of a bag-- that are made from absolute crap and sprayed with meat flavoring.|`|oQs2i4Z9aa	The nutritional needs of dogs and cats are easily met with a balanced vegan diet and certain supplements. James Peden, author of Vegetarian Cats & Dogs, developed Vegepet? supplements to add to vegetarian and vegan recipes. They are nutritionally balanced and also come in special formulas for kittens, puppies, and lactating cats and dogs.<br>  <br>  Learn more here: <a href="http://www.helpinganimals.com/animalsHome_gi_vegAnimals.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.helpinganimals.com/animalsHom...</a>|`|0eef821e877b14d3114ed09c28394a80aa	I have choosen not to change kind of dry food I buy my 2 grown cats..since they (and dogs) are obligatory carnivores. How can you say to the lion or the wolf it can't have meat.. since that what's they are made to do. We have a choice, they don't. I would esp. not do this to a growing puppy either....|`|eybHcHz9aa	It is totally possible for dogs (as there are plenty of websites!), though not for cats, as they need taurine in their diet.|`|eo0DKI0qaa	I suppose that if he is happy without eating meat than you could save a few animals and make him vegan|`|W7N9c3l2aa	Insane idea!<br>  Could kill the poor thing.<br>  Dont do it.|`|yf1A2FHfaa	How crazy is that? Its in the dogs blood/nature to eat meat - what a mad thought!|`|wmByvg9Paa	You vegans need to get real...  This is just ridiculous|`|TTEuv5cHaa	that's insane. i hate meat but i wouldn't stop giving it to my pet lol. dogs need meat!|`|BZZ2ZAVDaa	no r u crazy dogs need meat they can't get much protein from veggies like us|`|tpiznWzTaa	You can make your dog whatever you want it to be. If you never give it meat (or by products of), and the poor bugger's hungry then obviously it's going to eat whatever is put in front of it. Only thing is, when you are putting it's dish down, watch your fingers :o)<br>  Seriously though, what are you trying to do? A dog is a natural carnivore, and when you say 'it would suit me', it appears to me that you are striving for a 'Designer Dog' which would be no more than a (fashion) accessory.<br>  <br>  *edit* <br>  Just found this. It may well provide the best answer of all.<br>  <a href="http://rawfed.com/myths/omnivores.html" rel="nofollow">http://rawfed.com/myths/omnivores.html</a>|`|KeevlZnTaa	This is a personal choice. Dogs are omnivores like humans and can survive on a vegetarian diet. However, you need to do a lot of research and make sure that you are feeding them properly, and balancing their diet.<br>  <br>  If you choose a vegetarian dog food be sure it is from a reputable brand(one where the ingredients are high quality). Personally the only brand I would trust(since their meat based foods are top quality), are Natural Balance Vegetarian Formula.<br>  <br>  Plenty of dogs are eating vegetarian food. I have had a westie with terrible stomach issues and allergies and it was suggested that I try a vegetarian formula(which is often used for sensitive and allergy ridden pooches).|`|mQdWhY2laa	it is very possible. you can buy it online or make it yourself but you need to remember to add vitamin supplements|`|ne22im5Haa	TWO VEGITARIAN DOGS!!!

There are commercial dog foods for Veggie dogs and cats. That ought to tell you all you need to know.<br>  Over the past thirty years I have know many dogs and cats whose active healthy lives have been cheerfully sustained on a veggie diet including my All American Blue Tabby Persian -- Ali Katir of Meri Druid. So -- no problems. Go for it.|`|V69ugUNbaa	Personally I think the suggestion is mildly offensive and bordering on cruelty. That said I would like to make a suggestion: ask your dog what he wants to do.<br>  <br>  Put two bowls of food down every night for a week - one vege, the other meat based. After he gets tucked into one, take the other away.<br>  <br>  If by the end of the week he is going to the meat based food first, you have your answer.|`|tVUJUKWkaa	You can if you plan it extremely carefully, but I wouldn't recommend it. I'm a vegetarian and have researched about feeding my dog a vegetarian diet and it just didn't seem like a good idea. But they can thrive on them if you do it right. If you really want to, I would suggest researching and talking to your vet about it. Good Luck!|`|uq4ZuWnEaa	Do you want to kill the poor thing.  They are meat eaters by nature it will be like trying to turn wolves into vegetarians.   You are one sick person sorry but you just made me very angry and feel sorry for the little thing for having you as an owner.|`|YBoShTIOaa	Yes, I think so. I've heard it is possible to make dogs vegetarian and they do vegetarian dog food in some health shops I think and other places I'm sure. :)|`|IYSnKVCmaa	I suppose it would be possible, but to what end, by scientific classification dogs are obligate carnivores.|`|N53iI8weaa	No of course not|`|EJyOZxJyaa	in my opinion it isn't right.

jZRtTpZiaa	Nutritional yeast is not a source of B12 unless B12 has been added to the yeast.    It's also not a good idea to rely on any one fortified food all the time  for B12.   Use the fortified nutritional yeast in recipes because you like to use it-- not just for B12.   I take a very small amount of B12 in a supplement every day...  I buy the 500 mcg and cut one pill up to last a week.  It's a very cheap reliable way to get your B12.

3rmVGqWsaa	Okay I know the first guy said slip n slide but I know something way better.  With a slip n slide you have to go buy it and usually blow it up. That's a waste of time and money.<br>  <br>  Go to a hardware store like Minors Home and Garden.  Ask a person who works there where the big sheets of plastic are. Get the black plastic (it heats up better).  Buy a really big piece (big enough to fold it in two and its still as long or longer than a slip n slide.  Lay it out on your lawn in the back yard. You will also need those really big staples to hold it in place. here is a picture<br>  <a href="http://www.lawnh2o.com/Amazon/Stap001.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.lawnh2o.com/Amazon/Stap001.jp...</a><br>  Staple it in to the ground so it won't move. Then at the party get two hoses and take turns holding and spraying the plastic. You will slide so far on the plastic it is so fun.    <br>  Just an idea but its cheap and lots of fun.<br>  <br>  Have a great party!<br>  <br>  <br>  ~Claire~|`|6cd7cae3f8d44a82dd6c9bf47a165cd6aa	Slip n Slide.

A5gfxSyzaa	Onions are good for fiber, vitamin C, potassium and magnesium among other things.|`|MBTtIsF0aa	to me personally onions are good to send me to the hospital lol I am allergic to them, but only the real things, I can use the powder|`|OQ9A8Qbgaa	there good for making your food taste beter and spicier.|`|0wf8Q1Raaa	they are good for seasoning food.|`|BdlGBdE5aa	The primary reason for using onions is improved taste of food.  The byproduct of that great taste is bad breath.  So people will suffer the bad breath because they love to eat foods that taste great.<br>  The onion bad breath is primarily caused by the onion smells collecting on the top of the tongue.  These smells can be easily removed with a very good tongue cleaner.  I use OraBrush.  It is both a brush and a scraper.  It will take garlic and onion breath off the tongue.  It will also take of the bacteria that cause normal bad breath. Here is the website: <a href="http://www.orabrush.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.orabrush.com</a>
AA11786341	As delicious as onions are, walking around smelling like them is another story.<br>  <br>  Onion smell is pervasive and irritating long after the delicious meal is over.<br>   It clings to the fingers and nail region with ferocity.<br>  <br>   It even affects your breath!<br>  <br>   Indeed, onions have a very potent smell, because onion oil contains 1-propenyl sulfenic acid, which is thought to be the lacrimator in onions. <br>  <br>  The lacrimator is something that makes your eyes water and gives the onions such a distinct smell.<br>  <br>  Bizarrely enough, this stinging, tangy chemical is also the cause for a lot of the great flavor in onions, as well as the satisfying fragrance when you fry the vegetable<br>  <br>  Onion Breath Removal<br>  <br>  * Bacteria-induced onion breath can be reduced by usual oral hygiene methods. Standard halitosis remedies include regular use of mouthwash, brushing and flossing teeth, and tongue scraping.<br>  <br>  * There are also commercial bad breath remedies available that are more powerful than the usual mouthwashes you can buy in supermarkets. These are available from your doctor, your pharmacist or the Internet.<br>  <br>  * Another method of reducing onion breath is to eat parsley with your meal. This seems to counteract the problem to some extent (the same with onion's far more powerful cousin, garlic), although it doesn't prevent it completely.<br>  <br>  * Some people also claim that chewing cardamom seeds has a similar effect to parsley and can work as an onion breath remedy. Cardamom has a very strong flavor, so this might not be an option for some people.|`|0wf8Q1Raaa	they havee a real strong smell..|`|DuGAysygaa	Its just the way they are, i guess.|`|W1GHZW3Caa	cause onions smell bad|`|RU2Yz6jEaa	eat a lemon after eating garlic or onion foods. also to get the smell off your hands after cutting, rub with lemon. i dont know why, but it works.|`|ZoeS825Kaa	they're packed with sulfuric acid, which gives it that strong smell and also irritates the eyes until they tear up|`|f6coyafAaa	It is just something that happens.

Garlic also smells because of the same type of compounds.  Bad breath in humans is caused by the bacteria Solobacterium moorei, which produces great quantities of sulfur containing compounds.  This bacteria is light in color and can be seen by looking on the top of the tongue for some white stuff.  This must be removed to get rid of bad breath.  Also, when you eat an onion much of the smells collect on the tongue and produce the onion smell.  This material can also be removed with a tongue cleaner.  The best tongue cleaner on the market is OraBrush:  <a href="http://www.orabrush.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.orabrush.com</a>|`|7Tesm2vwaa	They have certain acids......

9Kt7p7Vfaa	This is probably for a school project right, so you want something more motivational than saving it. A car is a pretty good thing to spend money on at that age, hanging out with your friends anywhere that requires money, a new Ipod or cell phone, spend it on spring break (although that may lead to drinking), some sneakers. You may want to consider throwing in some of the penalties for drinking underage, something about the fines associated if you get busted and what started out as two beers ends up as a summer job to pay your parents back for bailing you out.|`|AA11484395	Save it, you may not be able to find a summer job this year, as people with families are going to need the jobs that teens usually get during the summer.

AA11314258	Yep, I lost weight anyway.|`|sMTVcfiVaa	It depends. Going vegetarian cuts out a lot of fat and saturated fats as well as hundreds of calories that you would ordinarily get from meat.<br>  <br>  But it depends what *kind* of vegetarian you are. Are you a mac and cheese, ice cream, pizza kind of vegetarian? Or are you a tofu, vegetables, V8 kind of vegetarian?<br>  <br>  If you eat right and stay active, you'll lose weight. If you lay around and eat potato chips and Little Debbies all day because they're vegetarian, you won't lose an ounce. Just keep an eye on what you watch, vegetarian or not, and you'll lose weight and get healthier. <br>  <br>  Congratulations on becoming a vegetarian! Keep up the good work. :)|`|RaV7SidDaa	yeah because you dint eat all the saturated fats that make you fat  the way meat eaters do|`|s0wBK9eYaa	No their diets are way too high in carbs and your misinformed about saturated fats and cholestrol.

Low-carb diets are the healthiest diet.|`|FFF7oGDzaa	it all depends on your diet. if you become vegetarian or vegan an only eat muffins, bagels, etc... you wont lose weight. if you follow a well balanced plant based diet you may lose some weight. you also need to make sure that you are getting essential vitamins.|`|Gf8Hi4Pbaa	Absolutely.

Veg for 1 month, lost 6 pounds or so.|`|pQ1KlYtgaa	Not really, vegetarians are intaking so much protein from vegetables and others foods because most vegetarian do not fill a person up so they eat more. Protein if not used is stored as fat, body can not store protein. Meaning if a person is not active all the time a large amount of protein is not burned off and eventually just stores as fat.|`|RU2Yz6jEaa	you dont need to go vegetarian.  just eat healther. walk 20 minuates a day etc. i have seen fat vegetarians, and i have seen skinny meat eaters. so think about it. what happens when you go off the diet? you will gain all the weight back. diets dont work. because you eat healthy for a month or two, and your body appreciates it. so you lose weight because of the healthy choices. when you stop eating those healthy foods, your body will gain the weight back from eating those unhealthy foods again. make lifestyle changes, dont diet.|`|9R2PSAfsaa	Vegetarian can't guarantee you lose weight... because vege only replace carbohydrate to vitamin and protein only.

This usually translates to roughly one shot, 4-5 oz of wine, or one beer. <br>  <br>  Remember that every drink will have a different ABV/proof - especially with drinks such as beer.

DoHaUEziaa	My favorite way to season steak is to place steaks in sealable plastic bag, shake worchestire sauce (enough to coat) and montreal steak seasoning. Let marinate for about 30 mins. turning once. Broil under broiler till done. About 6-7 minutes per side. Check for doneness.|`|355b8dca4624a65380892a4d414c9d3faa	Cook steaks in a pan with salt and pepper and olive oil. Maybe even a little garlic too. Sear them first then turn down the heat and cook longer for well done. Or broil on low heat.<br>  <br>  In an oven or broiler you can roast the pineapple.|`|35Gn7XNAaa	i think you should just season the steaks with some salt and pepper and just cook it in the oven|`|3c7af99d45cd29de4b5830261c158f92aa	If you have onions and bell pepper (red or green or both), seal the steaks in the pan with a spoon of oil, reserve. Cut the onion and the peeper, I like julienne but you can cut them any way you want (plume, bite size, etx). Saute the onions and peppers. Meanwhile prepare a vegetable (or meat) broth, about a cup and a half to two cups. You can just boil some water if you have powdered instant broth.<br>  When the onions are transparent, put back the steaks in the pan and add the broth. Let it reduce until the meat is at the point you like.<br>  You can add the broth in parts to be sure that you get the consistency that you want. I like it juicy because I eat this with steamed rice and it tastes great when the rice absorbs the broth mixed with the meat juices.<br>  You can do this just with onions or add other things you have (and like). I use sometimes celery or soy sprouts.|`|QWY0P98Haa	If you are gonna eat them well done, make a kabob. do some onion, bells pepper mushrooms and pineapple on it along with chunks of the steak and put under  your broiler|`|AA12111193	hmmm well u can marinate them with the pinapple if u cut it up mix it in a bowl with some salt pepper woshtershire sauce and a little bit of extra virgin olive oil then grill them and itll turn out great|`|GIwwNIICaa	Hi pineapple is sweet does not go with steak, to grill your steak, put tour oven on at 200c get a thick pan, put it on the stove on high heat, when hot add 2tablespoon of oil, when it boils, place steak in the pan and sear the steak for 1minute on either side, remove it from the fire and place it in the oven, I don't know how thick your steak is, but 2minutes for rare, 5 minutes for med, 8 minutes for well done, depending on your oven,  on top put fried onions or mushrooms, green peppercorn in butter wine stock and cream. Reduce well pour over steak, enjoy

IsrBX4O4aa	Most veggies and fruits are good for you, taken in moderation, though even 9 or so servings a day are good for you. As for the lemons, while they are good, eating them like you do - a lot of them and the use of salt on them - is not good for your sodium intake and they eat your tooth enamel. Ease up on the lemons, though once in a while as a treat won't hurt, and indulge in other fruits...strawberries are great with a little black pepper sprinkled on (sounds absolutely ridiculous but it's delicious!!), or a mix of different melons or berries or different citrus (with some of the lemons thrown in). <br>  <br>  As for veggies, try eating the darkest coloured veggies you can find...dark leaved lettuces, red and orange peppers, broccoli and cauliflower, turnip and kale...these are all great cooked up with a little onion and garlic...<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|ea058c1a2a54c25c095836f47356075baa	Sweet potatoes and red peppers...supposedly the two perfect foods.

Some cuts of beef are not good for steak. Grilling may just toughen it. Some cuts have little or no fat marbling, and they are tough and not that flavorful. The best cuts are ribeye loin, strip loin, and tender loin. <br>  <br>  Other cuts that get made into steak are top sirloin, which is the butt of the steer. But it takes knowledge to cut that, because it has a lot of muscles going in different directions, and as someone else mentioned above, you need to be sure you don't cut with the grain of the meat. You might be cutting across the grain correctly, and then cut into another muscle, and then be with the grain. Since you said it was a big hunk of meat, I'd guess this is what you are talking about. If that's true, then it should be marinaded, using one of the recipes already mentioned. It should be cut pretty thin, but realize it will curl up as it cooks. So you need to sear it on both sides, for 20 to 60 seconds per side, depending on how hot your grill is. Then cook it the rest of the way slowly on each side. <br>  <br>  But if it's one of the better cuts, then the grain issue is easier, they usually have decent marbling and are tender. So they don't need marinade. I usually just coat them lightly with good olive oil, fresh black pepper, and maybe fresh chopped thyme or cilantro. Then season them with salt just before cooking. That is when your grilling technique is important. You need a good sear on both sides, and then enough time to finish it on both sides on a cooler spot on the grill.|`|OBuzcIDbaa	Are you talking about prime rib roast? If so, here's a recipe and tips:<br>  Major points:<br>  1... Follow the directions to bring to room temp<br>  2... Don't open the oven unless you are really sure it is almost ready<br>  3... Follow the directions to a tee and use a LOT of pepper (I use salt, pepper and garlic on mine).<br>  <br>  5-rib prime rib roast <br>  Salt and pepper<br>  <br>  Bring prime ribs to cool room temperature (about 1 1/2 hours out of the refrigerator). Make sure you know the weight of the roast. <br>  Preheat oven to 275 degrees. <br>  <br>  Season roast extremely well with salt and pepper. Place in roasting pan, fatty side up, and place in oven. Cook until desired degree of doneness is reached (resist the temptation to open the oven door a lot). For rare meat, the roast should take about 20 minutes per pound. When you're within half an hour of your estimated finish time, remove the roast from the oven, and plunge a quick-read thermometer into a fleshy part of the meat near the center (don't do anywhere near a bone). We like to stop cooking the roast in the oven at 115 degrees; this is extremely rare, but the roast will continue to cook as it stands outside the oven (the temperature should go up 5 to 10 degrees). If you remove it at 120 degrees it will be rare, and at 125 degrees it will be medium-rare; we wouldn't recommend going much higher than that. <br>  <br>  Place the roast on a cutting board, uncovered, and let it rest for 15 minutes. <br>  <br>  When ready to serve, simply cut the meat away from the bone in one enormous chunk. Then, cut the "filet" of meat into slices and serve immediately. Cut through the bones (you'll have 5), and serve them separately|`|AA11594108	We have to know what cut it is, if it is a rib, that's fine.<br>  <br>  If it is shoulder or brisket, you are SOL.|`|F2ugW4cRaa	For a start it will be from a steer (male) not cow (female)<br>  <br>  <br>  "It will depend on the cut of the beef".<br>  <br>  As it is cut, it is for long cooking times.<br>  <br>  Cut across the grain, and I would suggest no thicker than 1/2". <br>  Hopefully your marinade will help tenderise it.<br>  Barbecue Marinade<br>  1/2 cup chopped onion<br>  1 1/2 Tbsp. brown sugar (packed)<br>  1 Tbsp. vegetable oil<br>  1 Tbsp. prepared horseradish<br>  1 Tbsp. water<br>  1/4 tsp. coarse ground pepper<br>  Cook onion and brown sugar in oil in small saucepan over medium heat until onion is tender, about 3 minutes.  Add remaining ingredients and continue cooking over medium heat 3 to 4 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Remove from heat; cool thoroughly before adding to beef.<br>  <br>  Make the time well before you want to cook to make one so you can check the timing.|`|Z4QbQt3Xaa	Lay the roast end on a cutting board & use a large sharp knife.<br>  Draw the knife back & fore evenly, parallel to the cutting board.<br>  Keep the steak thickness even as you proceed.<br>  It there is bone, you may have to use a clean new hack-saw also.<br>  Use an Italian salad dressing for the marinade.

BWxSSADaaa	Eating a vegetarian or tomato based curry does not save you, although it is a better choice than a creamy one.  All Indian curries use massive amounts of fat (ghee or oil).  Generally, roti is not a better choice than naan, even if it is cooked in a tandoor.  Roti is generally brushed liberally with ghee before serving, whereas naan generally is not.  Therefore, the caloric density of naan is lower.<br>  <br>  Grilled/tandoor items are a good choice.  Even fattier meats (lamb, beef) lose much of their fat when they are grilled.  Avoid anything fried, like bhajia or samosa.  Raita is good, although it's usually made with full-fat yogurt.  Cachumber is a very good option; it's tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, spices and a very light dressing.<br>  <br>  For rice, go with plain steamed rice if it's available.  Biriyani is usually greasy in restaurants.  Even jeera rice and mattar palao (rice with cumin and rice with peas) are cooked with oil, although some restaurant's versions are oilier than others.<br>  <br>  General strategy: eat things that are grilled, baked in the tandoor, or are fresh (salad like cachumber).  Avoid breads and rices as much as you can, they will likely have "hidden" fat (ghee brushed on roti, for example).  If curry is served in a bowl separate from your serving plate, a lot of the oil will float to the top.  Try to scoop from the bottom.  (Seriously, this is something I always do.)|`|oDz0FQpEaa	Try Tandoori chicken with no sauce. Indian food is particularly high in calories because a lot of the sauces have cream in them. Avoid the naan bread too. If you do feel like getting a sauce try to stick with the tomato based ones such as rogan josh, it will have less calories than say for example korma. You should also get boiled rice instead of pilau or fried.<br>  Hope you have a nice meal!|`|2d7163e6fbb32121be39f1602d1e4abcaa	Probably one of the veggies dishes. A big no no is Nan bread.

On the whole, all Indian fare is really healthy due to the reliance on vegetables and legumes .  <br>  <br>  Every dish will be designed to tempt you and all will be flavoured to perfection, each with the chef's own blend of herbs and spices, and only a tiny amount of fat (perhaps around a tablespoon for a whole dish!)

People can feel light- headed and dizzy and pass out.” While the athlete is drinking an energy drink to get pumped up, it could actually have the opposite effect. “In the worst-case scenario, it could lead to sudden death,” said Dr. Morales. “Most young athletes haven’t been seen by a doctor and don’t know if they may have an underlying medical problem.

Dm9L3EdAaa	I've honestly never understood the whole sprouter tray thing.  It does take up a lot of room.  <br>  <br>  Get yourself a  clean quart jar.  Put some alfalfa sprouts in the bottom.  I'd guess about 3 tablespoons.  Pour some water over the sprouts and leave them alone for about 5 minutes.  Then cover the jar opening with a couple layers of cheese cloth.  Secure it with a rubber band.  Dump out the water keeping the seeds inside.  Rinse the seeds once or twice a day.  You'll get sprouts in a couple of days. <br>  <br>  A cheap and delicious seed to sprout is ordinary dry lentils you can by at the grocery store.  I sprout lentils quite often.

OwloXYe5aa	There is no real answer for this. Lots of variables go into whether you are a heavy drinker or not like gender, height, weight, etc. For instance, if you were a petite girl, 5 foot and 90 pounds, that would be a lot. The only person who can really help you on this is your doctor. If you have any questions like this, it's best to go to your doctor. Though 7 shots a day does seem to me a bit heavy, there are just too many variables to really decide for sure.|`|AA10102704	Yes. 1 drink = a 12 ounce beer, 8 ounce glass of wine or 1 shot. So , yes you are having 7 drinks per day. 1-2 is considered normal in the quantities mentioned above.

LlAgMdb7aa	As long as there has been ice cream and sticks : ) <br>  <br>  In 1905, the Popsicle was invented by an eleven-year-old Frank Epperson. Frank Epperson was only 11 years old when he invented the originally named Epsicle. He had left his fruit flavored soda outside on the porch with a stir stick in it. The drink froze to the stick and tasted good. It took 18 more years in 1923 for Epperson to apply for a patent for a "frozen ice on a stick" called the Epsicle ice pop, which his children re-named the Popsicle. <br>  <br>  In 1925, Frank Epperson sold his famous Popsicle to the Joe Lowe Company of New York. Good Humor now owns the rights to the Popsicle. <br>  <br>  <br>  Twin Popsicles (two popsicles sticks together) were invented during the Great Depression. <br>  Popsicle sticks were first made from Birch wood|`|hNa5oHxQaa	lollipop and icicle|`|AA12111193	well break up the word popsicle icle - frozen ice  pop - its on a stick  like ex lolipop candy pop <br>  get it?<br>  hope i helped|`|BGmZ2ps5aa	lolliPOP icICLE    <br>  yuppperzzz im a smart one i am

But, for the sake of "tradition," I include instructions here.<br>  <br>  1 large or 2 medium potatoes per person, peeled and cut into half-inch thick fingers ("chips")<br>  white fish fillets** - 1 piece per person<br>  4 oz plain flour<br>  pinch of salt<br>  1 egg<br>  quarter pint (150 ml) mixed milk and water<br>  small amount of flour to coat fish<br>  oil or fat to deep-fry<br>  <br>  Method<br>  When the chips are first cut, place in cold water to firm up; heat the fat or oil and, whilst it is heating, drain the chips and dry them as much as possible with a clean tea-towel or kitchen paper. When the fat is hot, lower the chips in CAREFULLY, preferably in a chip basket, and cook until they are just beginning to turn golden. Remove from the pan and drain. Meanwhile, prepare the batter for the fish**: beat together the flour, salt, eggs, milk and water (substituting some of the water with beer makes an excellent batter.)<br>  Coat the fish with flour and shake of any excess; hold the fish by the very end and dip into the batter, making sure it is coated entirely. Lower it gently into the hot fat and fry for 5 - 7 minutes, the exact time will depend on the type and thickness of the fish; it will float to the surface of the fat when cooked. Lift out and drain; meanwhile, reheat the fat/oil and cook the chips for a second time - they will not take long and will also float when cooked. <br>  Drain and serve the fish and chips - the traditional accompaniment depends on the part of the British Isles you are in: salt and malt vinegar is most usual, but you can also have tomato ketchup, tartare sauce or, in Yorkshire at least, mint sauce!<br>  <br>  **The actual variety of fish served depends on what is caught locally. No part of the British Isles is more than 60 miles from tidal waters, so fresh fish is readily available. Most usual is cod or haddock, but also tasty and popular (and cheap) is the species sold variously as Ling, Huss or Rock Salmon.|`|F2ugW4cRaa	You are talking about Beer Batter.

It’s the sugar that makes you crave more and by adding protein it slows down the sugar going into your blood stream.  Choose healthy sweet snacks, even a small amount of dark chocolate is good for you.  Go for a banana or applesauce if you want sweets.

9e11df00019ad57ae83fd8ebfdfbc709aa	It all depends on the rice, not the cooker.<br>  <br>  Don't buy sticky rice----try using jasmine rice, or another long grain rice (think Uncle Ben's) rather than a short grain which will always be sticky.<br>  <br>  The reason you wash the rice is to remove any foreign particles, a small amount of starch washes of but that does not affect the rice texture.<br>  <br>  Restaurants use industrial rice cookers (at a couple hundred bucks a pop)......feel free to ask your favorite restaurant the brand of rice they use and try it out in your Zojirushi rice cooker before you go out and buy another appliance.|`|ii1HGOY4aa	not really sure about the ricecooker since i cook my rice on the stove. but i know rice varies from brands and qualities.if u dont want sticky rice u might want to change the one ur using right now, or try to lessen the water.<br>  <br>  *if u want to try cooking on a stove, use the rice cooker's pot. wash the rice once, add water and level the rice w/ ur hand, water should be just at the highest part of the back of ur hand (when laid down inside the pot). put it on medium heat. when it starts to boil, put it on the lowest heat. u can check it at that point if it's still watery, remove some excess water. its done when nothing sticks to ur finger when tapped slightly.|`|S5dtWq8jaa	If you are using Jasmine rice, which is typically a non-sticky rice, it has to do with you putting too much water in, or leaving cooked rice in the rice cooker for too long, or both.  I have a Zojirushi but depending these two factors, I could end up dry or sticky rice.  So try to put a little less water in your current rice cooker every time until you get the dry texture you want...and when your rice cooker has done cooking, fluff it immediately then put the cover back on for 5 minutes, then serve.

IsrBX4O4aa	Absolutely!! The sodium levels are through the roof and the artificial sweeteners are really pretty bad for you.  Also, there have been some studies showing that if you consume something sweet (even if it is artificial) then your appetite is heightened. That's why if you drink a lot of diet soda thinking you'll lose weight, you don't. If you cut out all the diet sodas, you will be able to see a significant change in your weight and how you feel. <br>  <br>  A great alternative is to try mixing 2 parts favorite fruit juice (Just Juice has great ones that aren't too bad sugar-wise) and 1 part seltzer (make sure it's seltzer, which has VERY little sodium). <br>  <br>  If you have to drink a soda, drink one of the little ones, with regular sugar.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|2e6303cd8e5f1d72d2d1cc2f17d47cd2aa	Yes!

I really have never tried vegan cheese. Vegan mayonnaise, other wise known as "veganaise", is actually quite good too. Now soymilk really just gives you a very hard to explain unpleasant feeling in your throat after you drink it, and it isn't good at all, except soy eggnog actually tastes good. Same goes with rice,almand,peanut etc. milk, not good at all.|`|s0wBK9eYaa	Bad bad bad! Instead focus on buying quality dairy products (those that don't contain hormones and antibiotics and come from grass-fed cows) from a local dairy in your area. <a href="http://www.realmilk.com/where1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.realmilk.com/where1.html</a><br>  Also even though some drinks are "fortified" doesn't mean your body is going to absorb though nutrients because they are in an altered form. Most other "alternative" milks are high in carbs like rice milk and even almond. Soy causes health problems of its own since it is not fermented soy (the only kind you should be eating).|`|FFF7oGDzaa	I like them and many are fortified with vitamins (including B12). here are a few that I like<br>  <br>  rice dream rice milk<br>  soy milk<br>  follow your heart vegan cheese- this one melts<br>  tofutti "sour cream" and "cream cheese"<br>  tofutti cuties (fake ice cream sandwhiches)<br>  <br>  they all taste great.

I'd swear by it.<br>  <br>  Almond milk, rice milk, hemp milk and oat milk are all fantastic. Try a few different brands to see which one would be best for you. <br>  <br>  Make sure that when you are out vegan cheese hunting that it does not say 'casein' in the ingredients list as that is an animal product. Vegan Gourmet is good and melts. You can also make your own cheesy spreads out of Nutritional Yeast flakes.I have seen a lot of recipes online. <br>  <br>  Tofutti makes some awesome Better Than Cream Cheese and Better Than Sour Cream. They have the same consistency as their dairy counterparts. (And what is better--I have seen them in regular markets.)<br>  <br>  Soy and rice ice 'cream' are great. My favorite is Purely Decadent--outta this world.<br>  <br>  They even make soy whipped cream, however, I have never had it.<br>  <br>  Whole Soy & Co. makes vegan yogurt that is tasty. <br>  <br>  Vegan Gourmet cheese is the best that I have found, but I don't love it. I really only use it when I want Salsa con 'Queso.' I am still waiting for a vegan cheese that is a little better in flavor--but you can't go wrong in the  'butter', 'milk', 'ice cream' etc categories.

Going vegan is not something to walk into blindly because you need to know what you need to eat and what you don't and asking a couple of questions from people who may or may not know what they are talking about is not going to get you everything you need.  It's also going to get you some untruths, like vegetarians eat fish or vegans need protein pills.<br>  <br>  That being said:<br>  <br>  You need to eat lots of fruits and vegetables.  Try for at least 5 a day but that's a low number - you should have more then that.  Aim for a variety of colors as they tend to have different nutrients.  Dark green veggies have iron and calcuim, orange/yellow have vitamin c and A, etc.  Don't rely on the same veggies all the time - a variety is more likely to make sure you get everything.<br>  <br>  You need whole grains like wheat bread, brown rice, oatmeal, etc.  The more processed it is the more the nutrients are missing so try any stay away from white bread and pasta.<br>  <br>  You need beans, peas, nuts and legumes.  They will give you protein, fiber and other things you need.<br>  <br>  You need good fats for your digestion and brain.  Olive oil is one, and easy to use for cooking foods.  Avacados are another, and coconuts.<br>  <br>  Look into getting a vegan cookbook or two.<br>  <br>  People are going to tell you to take a protein powder.  Don't.  The average American gets about 3 times as much protein as they should which is bad for the kidneys and bones among other things.  As long as you are eating well you don't need etra protein - there is protein in beans, nuts, veggies, legumes, seed, etc.<br>  <br>  Read packages.  You need to avoid anything with gelatin, whey, honey, some kinds of sugars, enzymes, lard and obviously beef fat, chicken, fish oil (I've seen it in OJ before)  This is where you need to do more research too because there are many things that are not recognizable by name.<br>  <br>  As for non-food shopping you need to make sure nothing is made of leather, tallow, suede, ivory, gelatin, etc.|`|FFF7oGDzaa	oh my where do i start...<br>  <br>  veggies are your friend. get creative with salads. use lettuce, spinach, kale, edamame, carrots, tomatos, onions, garlic, ginger, mushrooms etc...<br>  <br>  beans for protein (make sure you supplement B12!)- black bean burgers, veggie chilli, nachos with beans and vegan cheese<br>  <br>  portobella mushrooms are delicous in place of meat. fry up a big one and serve it alongside mashed sweet potatoes and a green salad. <br>  <br>  fruit, fruit, fruit- yes fruit has sugar. no fruit wont make you a fat *** (as long as you eat it in moderation). my new favorite is blended avacado, banana, and strawberries on whole wheat toast.<br>  <br>  there is so much out there... purchase some vegan cookbooks and start to experiment. I thought that a vegan diet would be expensive but its proving to be cheaper than buying meat and dairy. Just avoid tons of fake meats and buy whole foods.|`|n6nbfMp4aa	Anything that's not meat... unless your the type of vegetarian that also eats fish.... make sure you buy protein pills... or fish oil pills... or peanut butter.

In a large, heavy skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, add the chicken pieces to the skillet, without crowding the pan, work in batches and add more oil if necessary. Sauté chicken for 4 minutes, without moving, it will become nicely brown. Adjust the heat--up or down if needed. Turn the cutlets and continue to sauté for an additional 2 to 3 minutes until chicken is evenly browned and cooked throughout, (tenderloin pieces take less time, 2 minutes per side) Transfer the chicken to a plate and remove the skillet from the heat.

AA11610817	Any flavored vodka is good. Even though its popular to mix things with sprite, its not always the best choice if you don't want to taste the liquor. Sprite is kinda bland. Try raspberry vodka with cranberry juice and splash of pineapple juice (still really good with just the cranberry). Blueberry vodka, grape vodka, and cherry vodka are all good choices as well. (can be mixed with sprite....but cranberry juice adds more flavor) Plain, original liquor with no flavor can be harsh on your stomach. I've worked in a restaurant for almost 10 years.

If you want a sweet drink, just drink lemonade/ soda / pop - whatever you call it depending on what country you are in - as it's cheaper that way...but I know some people want to).  In my opinion, save your alcohol consumption for wine / beer.

Instead of buying the substitutes try the real stuff.  You won't believe the flavor difference.<br>  <br>  Use Heavy Cream (not Half 'n Half).

The colder all items are the faster it whips.  <br>  <br>  Pour 1c. cream and 1 t. vanilla into the bowl and beat at medium speed til starts to froth, then increase to high and continue whipping til done.  Enjoy<br>  <br>  (go to this website for a video)|`|596ba0725523b654ae88f9a7d31dae51aa	Shaking might work if you use a big enough container. The best bet is to whip it with an electric mixer until you get soft peaks. Or a wisk and some elbow grease. You should add a little powdered sugar to taste. Maybe a teaspoon or less of sugar. Or lots more if you like it really sweet.|`|4NxHSkktaa	Put the heavy cream in a mixer.  I never time it...I just wait until its fluffy and whipped creamy.

dvZ7OyUKaa	It is very easy to be vegetarian. I have been a vegetarian my whole life. (not kidding) i am 13 yrs old. 5ft 4in. And 95 pounds. I am slim but not anorexic skinny. Im in the normal BMI range. Just because you are vegetarian you dont always have to eat vegetables and bland tasteless foods. Just dont eat fast food, or meat, and get some exercise. It gets easier. I eat out about once or twice a week. Most restaurants have some dishes that specifically say vegertarian on the menu. Also, if you plan to be vegetarian just until you lose weight it wont work. You will just gain it back after you start eating meat again. Just try it. It cant hurt<br>   you. Both of my parents have been vegetarian for about 20 years and <br>  they dont even miss eating meat at all. Actually the thought of it <br>  repulses them. Lol. I like morning star farms brand. It has vegetarian chicken and sausage and bacon and burgers and many other things that taste good without being fatterning.|`|pZg05uygaa	If you temporarily become vegetarian just to lose weight, you'll gain the weight right back after you're off the diet. Adjust your diet so that you're eating less refined carbohydrates (like white bread and white rice) and refined sugar. Reduce the amount of meat you eat if its a lot now, but you don't have to eliminate it to lose weight. Get more fiber in your diet. And exercise, that will help you lose weight long term more effectively than any diet. <br>  A lot of people actually gain weight when they become vegetarian because they don't know how to eat properly and eat tons of starchy food. Being vegetarian isn't necessarily going to help you lose weight. You need to make a long-term commitment to exercise and eating a variety of healthy foods to be at an appropriate weight.|`|8RlYLfy2aa	To get proteins try eating things like nuts, beans and tofu. Really just eat what  you normally would, but elliminate the mea and eat a little bit more of other things or replace it with vegitarian alternatives. Remember that you wont like lose any weight if you eat the same amount of calories and such as you would non vegetarian, and dont forget to exsirsize, a very important factor of any weight loss plan.|`|oQs2i4Z9aa	Don't worry about getting enough protein.

Plus, the mugs are fun and insulate both hot and cold beverages.<br>  <br>  Are Styrofoam cups harmful to the ozone layer?<br>  No. The use of ozone depleting chemicals in Styrofoam products was outlawed in 1991.<br>  <br>  Can you recycle Styrofoam?<br>  Yes. Styrofoam is recyclable and Styrofoam recycling programs are expanding. However, wax-coated paper cups are not recyclable.<br>  <br>  Are paper cups better for the environment?<br>  No. The paper cup is substantially more resource-depleting to manufacture. Compared to the foam cups we use, the typical wax-coated paper cup requires 6 times the raw materials, 33 times the chemicals, and wastes 56 times the water.

My daughter who recently turned 21 enjoys the sweeter white wines.  Her favorites are Rieslings, Gewurtaminer, and Pinot Grigio.   Chateau Ste. Michele makes a great Riesling that is around $10 a bottle.  Columbia makes both a great Gewurtaminer and Rielsling in that price range.<br>  <br>  If you want to try a Red Wine, go with a Zinfandel.  Choose an Old Vine Zinfandel if possible.  Old Vine tends to produces fruitier (sweeter) wine.<br>  <br>  Learn more about wine at <a href="http://www.cheers2wine.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.cheers2wine.com.</a>|`|JvBGKmpyaa	Dry just means less sweet.  I haven't heard the term 'wet'; generally wines are described in terms of being sweet or dry.<br>  <br>  Starting with a rose is not a bad idea ( a chilled rose on a warm Summer evening can be just perfect).  Merlot also tends to be a slightly less full-bodied red wine, though the quality varies. (I'm actually now a fan of dryer full-bodied red wines like Shiraz; known as Syrah in the US, I think) <br>  <br>  As far as whites go, Rieslings are often a little les dry (some are quite sweet, others less so). Some Sauvignon Blancs can be easy to drink. <br>  <br>  I've found that with wine, it's a matter of trying different wine styles, blends and labels / wineries to find those you like. <br>  <br>  Most of all enjoy wine.  Don't take it too seriously.  Some you'll like, some you won't.|`|1T2qiNIvaa	You should try whit Zinfandel, preferably arbor mist.  It's very fruity.  Another good one is chardonnay mixed with a little bit of orange juice.  I know it sounds crazy, but it's really good. :)|`|Zrk9Ttruaa	You should drink Pink Lace wine it's semi sweet and so good.|`|pnCYdBUuaa	I'm no expert either, but dry wine has less residual sugars so it's more... almost bitter.  I would rose is a good recommendation, another way to kinda get into wine is to start with the wine products, like wild vines, or arbor mist, and that way you don't have a strong wine flavor but you can get used to the different tastes of the types of wine, to kind of have an idea where you might personally want to start your exploration.  One other thing that has been useful to me in my little wine journey, is to keep in mind that where the wine is from can make a huge differences.  I found that I had a harder time getting used to red wines because they are served warm and that made them seem stronger to me, but that Italian red wines are much milder, and so for me that was a really good place to ease my way into red.  Best of luck! It's quite a journey! :)|`|wod0JxD8aa	first off, 'dry' wine gets its name because after a drink, it leaves a rough, almost sandpapery feeling in your mouth, not usually what beginning wine drinkers like..<br>  <br>  'wet' wine is usually what all cheap party wines are considered because they are easy drink.. however, i like the more expensive wet wines..<br>  <br>  if your looking for something you would feel good about drinking, maybe even show off for a special someone, i would recommend a cabernet sauvigon(pronounced cabernay saw-vi-yuah-ng) or pinot grigio(peeno gree-jhee-oh)<br>  <br>  if you have a little more money, Malbec is an amazing argentinian wine, or a malbec-syrah (malbec is very wet, syrah is very dry.. good balance)<br>  <br>  message me if you have any other questions|`|7fce102f5f43444b6bef7f825b96601eaa	Personally, I tend to dislike red wines because they tend to be drier. If you're just starting out trying wine, I'd recommend starting with sweeter types: a Riesling is good, and they tend to be cheap, so you're not wasting quite as much money if you find you don't like it. If you do like Riesling, I'd also recommend a German white wine called Liebfraumilch, which is sweeter and quite good. <br>  <br>  In general, late harvest wines will be sweeter. I'd also recommend a Muscat/Moscato wine--these are my favorites. Port can be pretty good as well.|`|Gt8o7ICLaa	i don't know much about wine, but dry isnt about the alcohol content. and the other end of the spectrum isnt wet, its full bodied.|`|JyOVEAUEaa	start with straight shots and then pop bottles|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	I don't like wine in general but I think Shiraz tastes fine.|`|ZDfdbEl9aa	For someone who is starting out a Riesling would be a good choice in white wine.  If you want to try a red wine, a Beaujolais is fruitier and low in tannin, the substance that tastes like strong black tea and makes our mouth pucker.  I think you will enjoy both of those wines.  <br>  <br>  If you want to learn more about wines go to <a href="http://www.keepwinesimple.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.keepwinesimple.com</a>  You'll find lots of good information there.
HwUfcYsAaa	It doesn't sound like you are drinking too much water.  A person can actually drink too much water, but it takes a bunch.  People die from drinking too much water.  Their sodium levels will drop way too low and it has negative effects on the body.  You could actually drink water and only water and it would not hurt you, but you need to have nutrients from food and vitamins.

Serve with a chewy, semolina pasta shape that does not grab too much sauce: spaghetti, spaghettini, penne or bucatini."<br>  <br>  Preparation<br>  <br>  Place a large pot of water on the stove to boil. When water is rolling, add salt and pasta and cook to al dente, about 8 minutes, reserving 1/4 cup pasta water. While pasta cooks, heat large skillet over moderate heat. Saute pancetta in a drizzle of oil until it browns, 3 to 5 minutes. Add extra-virgin olive oil, garlic, and crushed pepper flake. Saute garlic 2 minutes. Add wine or stock to the pan and reduce liquid by half, 2 minutes. Beat together egg yolks, cheese, and while whisking vigorously, stir in a ladle of the boiling pasta water. Beat in parsley and pepper and set aside. Drain pasta. Add pasta to pan with sauce. Toss pasta with pancetta, then add egg mixture and toss 1 minute, then remove from heat. Continue to toss until sauce is absorbed by and thickly coating the pasta. Adjust seasonings with salt and pepper and serve with extra cheese, for passing.<br>  <br>  Zuni Pasta Alla Carbonara<br>  <br>  Ingredients<br>  <br>  6 Qts. water<br>  2 tbs. salt<br>  4 to 5 slices bacon, cut into 1/4- to 1/2" segments<br>  5 tbs. Extra-virgin olive oil<br>  4 large eggs, at Room temperature<br>  1/2 cup Fresh ricotta cheese, at room temperature<br>  1 lb Spaghetti, penne or bucatini<br>  3/4 cup Shucked sweet English peas or mature sugar-snap peas or double-peeled favas<br>  2 oz. (lightly packed) pecorino romano or pecorino sardo cheese, grated and divided<br>  black pepper to taste<br>  <br>  Preparation<br>  <br>  In a large pot over high heat, bring water seasoned with kosher salt to a rapid boil. In a 12-inch skillet or 3-quart saute pan over low heat, warm bacon in olive oil. Bacon should gradually render a little fat, which will mix with olive oil. Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, lightly beat eggs and ricotta. Drop pasta into boiling water, stir and cook. When pasta is one minute from being done, add peas or favas to water and raise heat under bacon. Cook bacon until it is just crispy on edges but still tender in middle. Turn off heat, slide pan from heat and swirl it a few times to cool it slightly. Drain pasta, shake off excess water and slide pasta and peas or favas into pan of bacon; you'll hear a discreet sizzle. Place pan back on burner used to cook bacon and immediately pour beaten eggs all over steaming pasta. Add most of the pecorino and lots of cracked pepper and fold to combine. Work quickly so the heat of the noodles, bacon and bacon fat slightly cooks eggs. Eggs and ricotta will coat pasta and form tiny, soft, golden curds. (If you prefer to cook the egg further, return pan to low heat, but use a nonstick pan, or else much of the egg and some of the pasta will stick to the pan). Serve in warm bowls and garnish with black pepper and remaining pecorino.<br>  <br>  This rogue version of carbonara is based on one I had in Rome. It is not very saucy, and the ricotta makes it pleasantly curdy. The bacon should be crispy-tender and aromatic; don't be tempted to cook it in advance--you will sacrifice much of its aroma to convenience and it will harden. And don't substitute Parmigiano-Reggiano for the aged pecorino. Serve with a chewy, semolina pasta shape that does not grab too much sauce: spaghetti, spaghettini, penne or bucatini.<br>  ===<br>  VELVEETA CHEESE ROLL <br>  <br>  1 lb.

Just slice any kind of apple you'd like, along with your favorite cheese (I normally do Sharp Cheddar and Fuji apples) and bread. Sprinkle some salt and pepper on the apple and cheese, and if you have fresh basil, it is really delicious on it.

You combine the two and mix until combined, and bake as directed on package. This is one of the moistest and most delicious cakes I have ever made, every woman who has eaten a slice has asked for the recipe! They are always shocked to learn how simple it its.<br>  Chocolate pudding cake:<br>  One package of Jello cook and serve pudding cooked and cooled, and one Chocolate cake mix prepared(not cooked, just mixed). Pour the batter into a bundt cake pan that has been greased and floured. Next pour in the pudding. Bake at temperature in instructions until the top springs back when you touch it. While the cake bakes, the pudding sinks to the bottom of the pan. Once it is cooled completely, you will put a plate upside down on top of the pan, and flip them both over together. When the cake comes out, the pudding is on the top! My family goes nuts for this one!<br>  Black Forest Cake:<br>  one prepared devils food cake mix(again not cooked, just mixed),and one can cherry pie filling. You pour the batter into a glass 13X9X2 pan. The you drop spoonfuls of the filling all over the top of the cake. Bake as directed on the back of the box, and allow to cool completely before serving. I like to whip up some cream with a TBSP. sugar and a tsp. vanilla, and serve on the side.

I think Bob's Red Mill makes one that's really similar to it.<br>  <br>  And, "in the morning" doesn't necessarily mean just at breakfast.

2HETgiwgaa	Do you mean dolmades? If so - here are two recipes for you.|`|8lYZROjuaa	I found a few recipes on these sites:<br>  <br>  recipes.epicurean.com/cooking_results.... <br>  <br>  www.bigoven.com/private/greek+dolma--r...   www.cooks.com/rec/view/0,1618,144176-254...  <br>  <br>   greekfood.about.com/od/appetizerssalads/... <br>  <br>  I hope you can find a good recipe in this bunch.|`|ozWi3TJlaa	They're called dolmades and they do take a bit of work.  Here's a good recipe:<br>  <br>  <br>  Ingredients<br>  <br>      * 1 (8 ounce) jar grape leaves (about 25 leafs)<br>      * 1 lb ground round<br>      * 1 lb ground lamb (You can use two pounds of Ground round if you can't find ground lamb)<br>      * salt, to taste<br>      * pepper, to taste<br>      * 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, minced<br>      * 1 (4 ounce) box tabouli mix (I cup raw rice if you can't find Tabuli)<br>      * 1 onion, fine chopped any size you want, I prefer mild sweet onion<br>      * 1 garlic clove (crushed or pressed into meat mixture)<br>      * 3 (16 ounce) cans chicken broth (you can use just water if you want.)<br>      * 4 lemons, squeezed or lemon juice, equivalent<br>      * 4 eggs<br>  <br>  Directions<br>  <br>     1.  Drain, rinse and dry grape leaves.<br>     2.  Place off to the side.<br>     3.  In a large bowl mix ground round, Lamb, salt, pepper, minced parsley, onion chopped, crushed or pressed garlic and Tabuli (or rice); mix well.<br>     4.  Lay out one grape leaf stem up, place about 1 rounded tablespoon meat mixture near stem.<br>     5.  Fold stem up over meat mixture fold one side leaf over mixture, fold top over then roll the rest but not tight.<br>     6.  This is just like making a burrito.<br>     7.  I use toothpicks to keep the stuffed leaves together.<br>     8.  Place in at least 1 gal pot.<br>     9.  Continue until all leaves are filled and snug in pot.<br>    10.  If you run out of grape leaves that's okay, you can roll little balls of meat mixture and place in pot.<br>    11.  Cover all stuffed leaves with chicken broth adding water if you don’t have enough broth, more broth if you have it on hand (you can use just water if you want).<br>    12.  Bring the broth to a boil then turn heat to low, simmer and cook covered until tender (pierced with a fork) about 30 minutes.<br>    13.  Remove about 1 quart of broth from pot and let cool down a little.<br>    14.  You want it hot just not scalding hot.<br>    15.  In another bowl beat 4 eggs until frothy adding slowly juice from lemon.<br>    16. Take the warmed broth and add to the egg mixture slowly a 1/2 ladle at a time still beating the egg mixture.<br>    17.  After all broth is mixed with egg & lemon slowly add to pot on stove.<br>    18  Cover the pot and turn flame off.<br>    19.  Let sit for about 10 minutes then serve.<br>    20. I like it tart and rich so I use more eggs and lemon then the recipe calls for.<br>    21  You can experiment how many eggs and lemon you want for the egg lemon broth.<br>    22.  Leftover broth in pot makes good Avgolemono (Egg Lemon soup).|`|dsXCvHLnaa	try foodnetwork.com and go to quick and easy.|`|K7JM2FsFaa	food network.com is a great resource

KT0UTX8taa	FOOLPROOF RIB ROAST OF BEEF  <br>  <br>  1 standing rib roast of beef, any number of pounds<br>  Salt & pepper<br>  <br>  Plan your day so you will not need your oven for anything else. You are going to roast the beef in the A.M. for 1 hour. You must leave it in the oven all day and the oven door must not be opened.<br>  <br>  Step 1: Let the roast stand at room temperature for 1 hour before placing it in oven. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. Rub roast with salt and pepper, place on roll in shallow pan. Rib side down. Roast for 1 hour after the hour turn oven off. Do not open the door. Then layer the roast the longer it continue to cook after oven off.<br>  <br>  Step 2: 30-40 minutes before serving time again turn oven to 375 degrees. Roast additional 30-40 minutes. This is fool-proof for rare roast beef. If you prefer medium or well done, add 15-20 minutes to step 2. Do not open oven door from time roast in oven until you are ready to serve the roast. Suggestion: Remove roast 15 minutes before dinner is served then the juices of roast will be absorbed.<br>  /////////<br>  FAST BEEF ROAST WITH MUSHROOM SAUCE  <br>  <br>  1 boneless beef rib eye roast (about 2 lbs.)<br>  2 tbsp. vegetable oil<br>  4 c. water<br>  1 can (10 3/4 oz.) condensed beef broth<br>  1 c. dry red wine<br>  2 cloves garlic, minced<br>  1 tsp. dried marjoram leaves<br>  4 black peppercorns<br>  3 whole cloves<br>  Mushroom Sauce (recipe follows)<br>  <br>  Tie roast with heavy string at 2 inch intervals.

Reduce heat to medium-low; cover, simmer 15 minutes per pound. Check temperature with instant-read thermometer; temperature should be 130 degrees F. for rare. Do not overcook.<br>  <br>  Remove roast to serving platter; reserve cooking liquid. Cover roast tightly with plastic wrap or foil; allow to stand 10 minutes before carving (temperature will continue to rise about 10 degrees F. to 140 degrees F. for rare).<br>  <br>  Prepare Mushroom Sauce. Remove strings from roast. Carve into thin slices and top with Mushroom Sauce. Serve with assorted vegetables, if desired.<br>  <br>  Note: A boneless beef rib eye roast will yield three to four 3 ounce cooked servings per pound.<br>  <br>  MUSHROOM SAUCE:<br>  <br>  1 tbsp. butter<br>  1 c. sliced fresh mushrooms<br>  1 c. beef cooking liquid, strained<br>  1 1/2 tsp. cornstarch<br>  1/4 tsp. salt<br>  2 dashes pepper<br>  1 tbsp. thinly sliced green onion tops<br>  <br>  Melt butter in medium saucepan over medium-high heat.

Place the standing rib roast upright onto a half sheet pan fitted with a rack. The rack is essential for drainage. Place dry towels loosely on top of the roast. This will help to draw moisture away from the meat. Place into a refrigerator at approximately 50 to 60 percent humidity and between 34 and 38 degrees F. You can measure both with a refrigerator thermometer. Change the towels daily for 3 days. <br>  <br>  Place a 16-inch round azalea terra cotta planter into a cold oven. Invert the planter to become a lid over a pizza stone or the bottom of the planter. The oven should be cold to start, to avoid any cracking in the terra cotta pieces. Turn the oven to 250 degrees F. <br>  <br>  Remove the roast from the refrigerator and rub with canola oil. Remember to rub the bones with oil, as well. Once the roast is completely coated with oil cover the roast with kosher salt, about half a teaspoon per bone. Next, rub with freshly ground pepper to coat the surface. Place the roast over a glass bake-ware dish slightly smaller than the length of the roast. This will catch the drippings needed for the sauce. Finally, place a probe thermometer into the center of the roast and set for 118 degrees. Put the roast and the bake-ware dish onto the pizza stone, cover with the terra cotta pot, and return to the oven. Turn the oven down to 200 degrees F and roast until internal temperature is achieved. <br>  <br>  Remove the roast and turn oven up to 500 degrees F. Remove the terra cotta lid and recover with heavy-duty foil. Allow the roast to rest until an internal temperature of 130 degrees F. is reached. Place the roast back into the preheated 500 degree F oven for about 10 minutes or until you've achieved your desired crust. Remove and transfer roast to a cutting board. Keep covered with foil until ready to serve. <br>  <br>  Degrease the juices in the glass pan. Place the pan over low heat and deglaze with 1 cup of water. Add the wine and reduce by half. Roll the sage leaves in between your fingers to release the flavors and aroma. Add to the sauce and cook for 1 minute.

Whisk beurre manie into broth mixture and cook over moderate heat, whisking, until sauce is smooth and slightly thickened, about 3 minutes. Pour sauce through a fine sieve into a bowl, pressing hard on solids. Season with salt and pepper. <br>  <br>  Cut rib roast into slices and serve with sauce.
J4wTIhsoaa	What I do, and it works for a nice crispy outside. Is I dip boneless skinless chicken breast in beaten egg(s - use 2 if using more than 4 pieces of chicken). then I put it in a mix of italian bread crumbs and spices like pepper and salt and garlic powder and grated Parmesan cheese. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees and cook for 20 minutes with foil on top of the baking dish. if you cook it in the pan-on top of the stove, the breading always falls off for me. Enjoy.|`|dHYVE076aa	For fried chicken try not using the bread crumbs. And make sure your chicken is really dry before you bread it. Baking it with the bread crumbs should be better, just put it on a baking sheet at 350 till golden brown. Your oil may not have been hot enough as well.|`|esRBuCglaa	i think mitsukais sounds the best.|`|oMVSKGKbaa	Baking works, but based on your cooking time I am betting it was not thawed chicken but frozen. Thawed chicken should not take more than 20 minuets. The skin helps, but here is a good trick. Start with the egg, then dip it in the seasoned flour, egg again, bread crumbs (corn meal is good as well). <br>  <br>  You need to use just enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan, your batter became saturated, making the batter fall off and ending any chance of crunchy. last but not least cover and cook on a low medium heat. 2/3 on side one 1/3 side 2. Covering keeps the heat in as well as the juices.|`|J1MuES4Kaa	It took 45 minutes to fry?<br>  <br>  Make sure you preheat your oil to about 300 degrees. If you start in cold oil the breading will just soak up grease and fall off. If its starts  getting dark on the outside and its still not quite quite done in the middle, throw it in a 300 degree oven uncovered until its done through.<br>  <br>  Maybe next time leave out the bread crumbs and just go flour to eggs to flour again.|`|D0bwDLXJaa	Maybe you could try using only 2 tablespoons of olive oil. I used to use a lot of oil, but found that using less helps. When cooking chicken breasts, I sometimes pound them down to be a little thinner, it makes for less cooking time. I hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|073e495ca8ebf7b9f0ad3b9627adb8b9aa	Most supermarkets carry Kelloogs Corn Flakes bread crumbs. They are excellent to use if you are looking for an excellent crispy coating (which will stay on). I soak my chicken pieces in buttermilk then use the crumbs. It's best not to cover in foil or anything else, as they steam will not be able to escape, thus, resulting in sogginess.|`|9e11df00019ad57ae83fd8ebfdfbc709aa	My first thought is, "whoa, that's a lot of oil". You could use enough to cover the bottom of the pan (a few tablespoons) then brown the chicken on both sides.  You can even throw it into a hot oven to finish cooking rather than doing it on the stovetop.<br>  <br>  As far as a crunchy breading you can try several things......instead of coating it in breadcrumbs you can try potato flakes, Panko (Japanese style breadcrumbs), or shake and bake. You can also try substituting the all purpose flour with rice flour or potato starch, then dipping it in the egg, then the crumbs.<br>  <br>  Also, if you have the time to make it in advance and let it chill in the fridge the breading will adhere much much better.<br>  <br>  Hope this works....
zVoozNxsaa	No they don't, and veggies are usually bought fresh (frozen ones are often blanched in boiling water).

Most consider people a rawist if at least 75% of their diet is raw/living foods.  The belief in raw foods is not a moral one - it is about health.  They believe that 100% raw is not best for every single person -but it is a goal to achieve.  <br>  <br>  Many frozen vegetables have been blanched in boiling water before being flash frozen - so most frozen veggies are out, too.<br>  <br>  BTW - not all rawist are vegan or even vegetarian.

tqD9xUpYaa	You could make Pork Chop Casserole.  Normally, I start with raw chops, but your already cooked chops will work also.  So in your case, saute some chopped onion in a little oil or bacon fat or whatever.  Put pork chops into a casserole dish.  Don't worry about them being in a single layer, but it will be covered.  Season with salt, pepper, paprika and caraway seed if they're not yet seasoned.  Top with sauteed onions.  Pour a can of condensed tomato soup over top and add 1/2 can water.  Give it a shot of Worchestershire sauce and a few drops of Tabasco.  Add frozen peas.  I normally use 8 to 10 ounces with 4 chops, but it's your call.  Cover casserole (foil is ok) and bake in 325 to 350 F oven until it's all bubbly.  I normally have mine in the oven about 45 minutes with having just browned the chops so it's already got a head start.  Your's might take an hour.  Serve chops with mashed or baked potatoes using the peas sauce as a gravy.  We enjoy this very much.  In fact, it's what my brother wants every year for his birthday dinner and he's now 60!|`|AA12336927	can u  pull them apart with two forks? then add ur fav BBQ sauce. have some pulled pork sandwiches.

CfPQwq3Qaa	You are probably boiling just fine.  There are two tricks to making them peel easier though.  When you use both together, you'll usually have better results.<br>  <br>  1) Don't use brand new eggs.  Eggs keep for some time.  I would use eggs (that aren't bad) that have been refridgerated for at least a week or two.<br>  <br>  2)Immediately place the hot eggs under very cold water or ice (ice works best) when boiling time is over.  The water will warm or the ice will melt, so you will need to do this at least twice as they cool.|`|bVROvLNSaa	What you are experiencing has nothing to do with boiling the egg, but has everything to do with how fresh the egg is.  What you are experiencing happens only with VERY fresh eggs that are hard boiled.|`|yZX1wpUJaa	Bring the eggs toa  boil then once at a boil close the fire and put the lid on top of the pot completely for 5 minutes.|`|XzLUA7ataa	Place unshelled eggs in a sauce pan and cover with cold water.<br>  Put pan over medium heat and bring water to the boiling point.  Reduce the heat to simmer.  Now watch your time, it depends on how large and how cold your eggs are.  Allow the following for 70 degree eggs.  If yours are right out of the refrigerator add at least 2 minutes more to the times:<br>  <br>  Soft cooked 2 to 3  minutes after you reduce the heat.<br>  Medium soft eggs - allow about 4  minutes<br>  Hard cooked allow about 15 minutes after you reduce the heat, then plunge them immediately into very cold water to arrest cooking and prevent the yolks from discoloring.<br>  <br>  Often fresh eggs are difficult to peel when hard boiled.  The eggs are easier to peel when about two weeks after purchase from market.|`|AA11484395	Fill a small saucepan with enough water to just cover the tops of 2-3 eggs, or more depending on how many you are cooking. Boil for 7 minutes. Remove from stove, turn off heat. Use a pan lid to hold the eggs in the pan and drain off the hot water, immediately fill the pan with cold tap water, let stand for 2 minutes, drain and repeat. Let the eggs sit in cold water for 5 min. Remove from cold water, and tap the shell in the middle with the back of a spoon, and gently peel off the shells.|`|kT8rhVdLaa	here you go read this <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.recipesource.com/main-dishes/eggs/01/rec0137.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.recipesource.com/main-dishes/...</a>|`|5sNOUCRKaa	I always put a tablespoon of salt in my water to boil it works for me every time they just peel so nice for me|`|Wt3t6rUPaa	When the water is boiling put the eggs in and cook them for ten minutes.<br>  Then run them under the cold tap until they are almost cold.  You can let them stand in the water for a few minutes. <br>  Take the egg and just roll it gently along the bench top so the shell cracks evenly along it.  I find it easiest to peel the egg in the water in the pot.  It helps to remove all the little shards of shell from the egg.  <br>  Occasionally you get eggs that are a pain in the behind to peel...but generally this method works really well for me.|`|AA11786341	Firstly, boil enough water in the kettle to cover the egg. While the water is heating up, prepare the rest of the breakfast.<br>  <br>  If you are removing the egg straight from the fridge, them prick the rounded end of the egg with a pin. This prevents the egg from cracking when put into the water.<br>  <br>  When the water has boiled, pour the required quantity into the pan. Turn on the heat, and wait until the water boils furiously. Now you put your egg into the water, taking care not to burn your fingers. Try not to drop the egg in, as the shell will crack, causing the egg white to spill everywhere in the pan. You can use a slotted spoon if you don't want to get too close to the boiling water.<br>  <br>  Boil for about eight minutes. This state of boiled egg inevitably causes problems due to timing, because if you remove the egg from the water too soon, you will end up with an egg with a soft centre.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Smash<br>  <br>  Quite self-explanatory and accepted as the most fun, this does require some practice. The aim is to break the shell so that it can be peeled off easily. This can be achieved by lightly tapping the egg at either the pointed or round end with a teaspoon, and increasing the taps in strength until the shell breaks. At this point you can start peeling the eggshell off, exposing as much of the egg as you desire,or peel completely|`|AA12022623	Make sure your eggs are fresh; cover them in COLD water and put over high heat; when it comes to a full boil leave on the heat for 1 minute, then take off and let the eggs sit in the water until it's just warm; remove eggs and start peeling; the shells should come off easily and there shouldn't be any green around the yolks.|`|K8guFb2paa	First boil the water.  Then, once the water is boiling put your egg in and let in cook for like four minutes.  Then, I hit my egg with a spoon to cut it in half and peen off the shell that way.

tqD9xUpYaa	It sounds to me like you aren't whipping it at a high enough speed or for long enough.  Have you added any sugar yet (slowly) since you got it whipped to foamy?

If not, chill it all now before continuing.|`|dTNeYWoSaa	I use heavy whipping cream- but I put the bowl and beaters in the freezer before I start and I whip it at the highest speed while moving it around the bowl. I have not had a problem with it.|`|J1MuES4Kaa	Temperature is pretty important with whipping cream, if you are using a handheld mixer, you should  get two of the same size bowls and fill one about halfway with ice and water, then set the other bowl in the ice bath. this will ensure your cream stays cold enough to whip.|`|9e11df00019ad57ae83fd8ebfdfbc709aa	You're positive you used HEAVY whipping cream, not light cream or half and half?<br>  <br>  Continue whipping at a higher speed and eventually it will make whip cream.......or butter if you let it go too long.

xrRZeROmaa	This and much much more information under Chinese Cabbage in Wikipedia, and it's many links to other sources.<br>  Why Eat It<br>  <br>  Bok choy, also known as Pak choi or Peking cabbage, forms a small but elongated head (not round like European cabbage) with plump white stalks and deep green leaves. A member of the brassica family, bok choy offers nutritional assets similar to those of other cabbages: It is rich in Vitamin C and contains significant amounts of nitrogen compounds known as indoles, as well as fiber--both of which appear to lower the risk of various forms of cancer. Bok choy is also a good source of folate (folic acid). And with its deep green leaves, bok choy has more beta-carotene than other cabbages, and it also supplies considerably more calcium. The stalks and leaves have quite different textures, so in culinary terms, it's like getting two vegetables for the price of one. <br>  <br>  Bok choy/1 cup cooked<br>  Calories                         20<br>  Total Fat (g)                     0.3<br>  Saturated fat (g)               0<br>  Monounsaturated fat (g)    0<br>  Polyunsaturated fat (g)      0.1<br>  Dietary fiber (g)                 2.7<br>  Protein (g)                        3<br>  Carbohydrate (g)               3<br>  Sodium (mg)                  58<br>  Beta-carotene (mg)           2.6<br>  Vitamin C (mg)               44<br>  Folate (mcg)                   69<br>  Vitamin B6 (mg)                0.3<br>  Calcium (mg)                158<br>  Potassium (mg)             631<br>  <br>  Yin and Yang of foods for proper balance of health<br>  <br>  Yin (cooling) foods:<br>  Steamed, poached, or boiled foods.<br>  Bok choy, bean sprouts, cucumber, eggplant, tofu, seafood.<br>  <br>  Yang (warming) foods<br>  Deep fried, stir-fried, or roasted foods.<br>  Meats & poultry.<br>  Garlic, ginger, spices, carrots, onion|`|d5abd43b2147ab853d2ec674d4a74280aa	Chinese cabbage is not only good for you (it's another green vegetable), but it's also a natural diuretic.
SjDVMh3Uaa	The restaurant probably served draft beer. The beer purchased in the store probably was not a draft even if it was the canned or bottled draft beer just is not the same as draft in a bar or restaurant.

If you keep the door closed then the temperature keeps rising. There is a fail-safe "off" at a certain temperature that will turn thebroiler element off at that temperature.<br>   Not good if you are in the middle of broiling.<br>   By keeping the door open the internal oven temperature never hits the "off" number and the broiler element stays on for the entire cooking process.<br>  <br>  You want the direct heat of the broiler element,<br>   not the heat of the surrounding air to do the cooking -- <br>  but if the door is closed and the oven keeps heating to the point where the broiler element goes off, you'll be baking, not broiling...|`|09fdLaeIaa	closed

Each shot is equivalent to over two regular shots so it's much easier to do than with regular booze.|`|tFoFchuEaa	I'd recommend mixing this with something. Just make a drink with only about 40% of a shot (0.6 ounces compared to a normal 1.5 ounce shot), which should make it equivalent to a regular shot at 40% alcohol.<br>  <br>  If you're pouring a full shot, it's close to 2.5 shots of regular alcohol. Just remember to pace yourself as getting alcohol poisoning is a lot easier with this stuff (and no more fun than with regular booze).|`|6b85bc4e41f739119fc3f5c16a0f0e84aa	Sooner or later you are gonna die.<br>  <br>  LOL.

Alcohol can kill, any type of alcohol (particularly if it's not ethanol).  The fact that it's 96% just means that less liquid has to be consumed to get alcohol poisoning. If you don't overdo it, you'll be fine.|`|yGDqC7gBaa	You run the risk of extreme alcohol poisoning with that nonsense.  I'm also sure that something that strong tastes vile.  Take a shot of it and put it in orange juice or something, for your taste buds' sake.|`|6ri7AYC1aa	96% is alot of alcohol.<br>  If you drink too much of that then you could possibly die or get alcohol poisoning.<br>  My advice is too drink very little of that.
