sunEk8NVaa	When the first tanks came out in WWI, the different countries already had artillery which could be used to destroy tanks. But the first REAL anti-tank weapons were anti-tank rifles which were basically rifles which had enough firepower to penetrate tank armor. In WWI, tanks were still primitive and weren't heavily armored yet. As to who invented the anti-tank rifles first, I don't know but I would go with Germany, same reason as the guy above, Germany needed it first. These rifles weren't that effective though and they became obsolete during WWII.    The first effective anti-tank weapons were anti-tank guns which are like artillery except they were especially designed to take on tanks. Who invented them? Again, I don't know...    Hand-held anti-tank weapons like the Panzerfaust and the Bazooka came in WWII.|`|pv8RjqzOaa	Wasnt it the Panzerfaust? Looks like an RPG.|`|3QsPl1uLaa	Britain invented the first tank during WW1. I would think Germany invented the first Anti-tank weapon since they were the first to need one.

Charles Darney says something like, well, if that any indication of who's coming, then we better get ready. Or something like that.     He is comparing the something that is natural to Lucy's feelings of people/footsteps. It explains a little more about her feelings, but I can't remember everything.    Hope this helps.

d5SLRSjwaa	The San Francisco production of Wicked isn't leaving in June. The theatre can only release tickets for sale ahead of time up to a certain point. As it gets closer to June, tickets for later in the year will be made available to the public. Also, the show only opened there a few weeks ago and it would be presumptive of them to put out tickets for more than a few months. They have to gage how receptive of the show the area is when it first opens before they turn it into a long run. Los Angeles loved Wicked so most likely San Francisco will as well.

jcK6EXpiaa	Non natives think that land is something to be owned and tamed, used for profit. Its not just settlers, its you too. Do you "own" porperty? Do you drink water from a re-routed stream? Do you shop at shopping centers built over marsh lands? Do you over-use and waste natural resources like oil and paper? Do you throw away a lot of garbage instead of buying compostable products? Chances are, yes you do. My tribe builds our buildings environmentally friendly, with recycled materials made locally. Even our plastic forks and spoons in our cafeteria are compostable (corn oil) and we have more recycling bins than garbage cans. Our reservation is mostly "owned" (more like cared for) by the tribe as a whole. My property for example, is owned by my tribe as a whole, but we respect each others' boundaries and have a limit as to what we can do with it/to it. We view our resources as not belonging to us, but to our children. Pre-invasion, my people were semi-nomadic by choice, not necessity. We would leave a village every few seasons to allow our waste to compost, and not return until it was clean again. We didn't make things that couldn't be returnd to the earth. We do not think ourselves so powerful as to own another of Gods creatures (this includes plants and animals and rocks/earth) In fact, in our language, there is no way to directly say something belongs to you (other than family) not even underwear, because nobody kept material things for very long. ITs a cultural custom for us to purge ourselves of material things often to stay grounded spiritually. We view ourselves as part of our region, its like, polar bears for example. THey belong in the arctic, that is their habitat. God designed them to live there, the climate of the arctic is suited to meet the needs of polar bears, and polar bears are designed to be sustained in the arctic. THey arent very healthy when placed elswhere (like zoos for example). Humans are the same. We have our regions, our habitat, that we belong to. We are no greater than any of gods other creatures. You know how american is the least respected nation in the world, but the most financially powerful (supposedly)? Its because most of this nation is comprised of people living outside of their habitat. They have lost the true sense of coneectivness with their surroundings, and they don't even realise it. So, to compinsate, they surround themselves with matierial things, and move often, thinking that a fresh start will give them the sense of peace that none of them truely have (unless they have close contacts with their homw country).|`|FaX8awk1aa	settlers used the land as a means of making money in addition to feeding their own family while the indians used the land for feeding their family only

The only people that would have at least slightly known about the radiological effects would have been the scientists making the bomb themselves.

CVqj8J4taa	That's a highly debatable subject.  I'm not sure why people think infinity is an adjective... it is most definitely a noun. http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/i...    I think it's safe to say that everyone will acknowledge its existence as a concept.  Where people begin to doubt its existence is when it comes to attainability.  I view infinity the same way I do 'absolute zero'.  To me, they both exist in reality but we are unable to observe them.  With absolute zero, you can get there but when you try to measure it, you have to introduce a new energy and its no longer absolute zero.  We get closer and closer to absolute zero but we can never reach it.  Same thing goes for a void in space.  You can't observe it unless you put something into it... and it's no longer a void.  Infinity is the same way... it's always one more foot... always just a little further.  You can't reach it, you can't observe it but it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.|`|nkjZ2moJaa	going by some set theory, there are two kinds of infinity: actual and potential.    an actual infinite is a set whose members equals all positive integers.  meaning an actual infinite is all the numbers from 1,2,3,... and so on.  while it is discussed in mathematics, it does not, i believe, exist in reality.  this is because of its impossible nature.    for example, if you subtracted all the odd numbers from an actual infinite, you would still have all the positive numbers, which would itself be an actual infinite (since the number of members would still be the same).  and the subtracted odd numbers would also be an actual infinite (for the same reason).  so you would have two actual infinites.  but its impossible to subtract half of something and have twice the amount.    on the other hand, a potential infinite does exist in the world.  this is not a contained set, but a continually growing number.  for a potential infinity, whatever number you have, you can add one more.|`|AA11442722	Infinity is just something which is beyond our ability to reckon. All things are finite including finiteness.|`|r7iZ2JOUaa	I do not think infinity exist unless our universe is eternal.|`|7948d322583be173cb825c04b51e58b2aa	First of all, how would you define a fact and exist?  Something observable?  You know as well as me that something infinite in time or space can not be measured.  This might lead to the incorrect conclusion that infinity doesn't exist.  We simply don't know if it exists or doesn't exists.  Yet there are philosophies and syllogisms that provide evidence that they do exist.      For example: M-Theory and many other popular GUTs suggest that some particals are infinitely thin in several dimensions.  Also, from our current understanding of Physics, time will continue to exist for infinaty.  Of course you probably would consider these ideas to be people's opinions and I am forced to agree with you, yet they are not without evidence.    This forces us to conclude that there is no way to KNOW if infinity exists or doesn't exist and therefore we should use the most reliable evidence avaliable to us in the mean time.|`|2z1h5mfOaa	As everything has its counterpart or opposite, and if there is a finite,  then there must be an infinite.  Even if we can't really fathom the concept.|`|5qnoX8lgaa	It is an adjective, it does not physically exist.|`|FoIxsunVaa	The concept of infinity has so many paradoxes (like infinity = 2*infinity + 3*infinity, infinitely; half of infinity is infinity, etc...) that unless the universe is a very irrational place, infinities do not exist.    How much is infinity minus the universe? Infinity. How much is infinity - infinity? 0 or infinity?|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	Infinity is an adjective, often treated as a noun.

And for those who have distinguished between the adjective and the noun, Infinity is that Space itelf. That is the fact. As an IDEA, infinity can also mean the unending series of, for instance, numbers - here is where the adjective comes in, for though numbers are truly infinite, that is, that there is no end to numbers, it is not that a series of infinite numbers actually exists.|`|qIaBOtltaa	yes. duh|`|AA11434633	Infinity (symbolically represented with ) comes from the Latin infinitas or "unboundedness."  It refers to several distinct concepts, usually linked to the idea of "without end", which arise in philosophy, mathematics, and theology.|`|6PQOjBrYaa	it is peoples opinion and imagination. no knows how to describe infinity in a mathematical formula. infinity is so mind staggering infinite that no telescope or spaceship will ever get there . the thought is based on the fact the people can t really see very far in the distance, and because things seem to be going on far behind the limit of peoples vision ,things start to blow out of understanding and therefore must be infinite. infinite representing the fact that no one has a clue and everything is only wild speculation ,but sounding terribly scientific. what i m saying is that with a finite knowledge it is no possibility to even consider infinity. logic dictates. therefore ,there is no infinity. only in the imagination|`|ZtGEyNJVaa	consider this.... if all numbers are, necessarily, less than infinity then infinity must exist. a set would be all the numbers less than infinity and must, necessarily contain all numbers. removing numbers from a set because they are odd numbers only creates another set which, necessarily, would still be less than infinity.    therefore infinity must exist because it is used to define the set of all numbers.|`|wQ5kZrPHaa	Yes, im just back from my weeks holiday there, it was brillant!|`|AA11503678	Reversely thinking, we could ask "Does past eternity exist?"     In math, infinity is used as mathematical sign. If you need to refer to something it must be there existing. Because it is required to exist.    Science discovered "Big Bang", so there must be something before universe become into existence.     By reasoning, comparing, contrasting about the things in universe, ourselves, life, death, time, love, mothers, birth, nature, animals etc. we derive conclusions which can be arguable.     I see every summer, blossom of flowers, and I see every winter death of flowers. I see; insects eat herbs, animals eat insects, humans eat beef, earth (eats) holds humans' bodies after death and herbs comes out from earth on graves....becomes a loop.     But, science discovers a comet will probably crash into earth.  Sun's heat can burn up the earth. Global warming is warning us. And how many wars and how many holocausts can this old world handle anymore? All of these are signs for an end of life on earth. That ends the loops and recycling on earth.    Big bang (Begins) - Big bang (Ends)    Who was before? Who is after? Will all the happenings on world be forgotten or judged?     There must be one thing that makes all these happenings meaningful. An absolute one is existing from past infinity to infinity, on what everything depends. The meaning of life is to discover this fact and try to find ways to get closer to the absolute one.

k13V3Xj8aa	Sci-fi makes it fun with space ships and robots... but beyond the backdrop it is about the characters.  Spend a while writing the history of all the main characters, what they love and hate... their weaknesses and strengths, their wants and needs.      Without being too formulaic in my approach the storyline needs some type of conflict and resolution.  Who is the protagonist?  Do you have a super evil "Ming" the Merciless?    In the end the fact is if people aren't invested in your characters, they  likely won't care about the story... People need to hate the bad guy and love the good guy.  Care what happens to them.      Of course Sci-fi at some level can be about "flash"  or the ooh-ah effects and pretty surroundings.      Think about Harry Potter or Star Wars.  The back drop is incredible but what makes it special is that you are invested in boy Harry Potter or skywalker.      A story is about someone overcoming "something"  whether that be the odds of a huge evil empire or a flaw in their own character.  When you have a character the person needs some reality in having flaws as well as strengths.  If a character is all powerful it's going to make a short story.  Even Superman had his limits, Kryptonitie, His challenge to ability to protect his idenity and his friends, his difficulty in always having to do what is right.... Just the last one, an evil guy could always taunt him out in the opening by some threat to the innocent and set a trap for him.      So what is a idea.  If you mean in backdrop just take a next logical step in technology... Cloning?  Genetic minipulation?  Robotics and artifical intelligence... but without someone you care about and a bad guy to hate it's all just eye candy.|`|AA10242125	Have a strong lead character.

eef0fd7a18ed1e8ac453b6086f666edfaa	The Russian Revolution of 1917 refers to a series of revolutions in Russia, and the events surrounding them. These revolutions had the effect of completely changing the nature of society within the Russian Empire and transforming the Russian state, which ultimately led to the replacement of the old Tsarist autocracy with the Soviet Union.    The February Revolution (March 1917) was a spontaneous popular revolution focused around St Petersburg. In the chaos, members of the Duma assumed control of the country, forming the Russian Provisional Government. The army leadership felt they did not have the means to suppress the revolution and tsar Nicholas II of Russia, the last czar of Russia, abdicated, effectively leaving the Provisional Government in power. The Soviets (workers' councils) which were led by more radical socialist factions initially permitted the new government to rule but insisted on a prerogative to influence the government and control various militias. The February Revolution took place in the context of the First|`|mV2krdVwaa	i don't remember the answers to the c+e but as far as involvement in the war, they dropped out near the end because of a revolution in october 1917 (the boleshivik revolution) and the provisional government made a deal with germany and then they dropped out of the war    for more info search the boleshevik revolution on wikipedia and also WWII then use control f and search "russia"|`|AA12198711	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_W...

VSy7kewAaa	The movie Choke actually already came out. I haven't read the book yet, because I havn't gotten around to a bookstore/library in awhile. I really liked the movie though.     Lulliby is on the top of my list, even over Choke. I want to read that book REALLY bad. It sounds so good.    Haunted is really the only book I've read by Chuck. I thought it was pretty good. But alot of people have been saying its one of his worst books. I really liked the stories in it though. Guts is epic. Theres also another one in there that was really sad (well most of them were sad) It was about these dolls. (I lent my copy of it to a friend, or else I'd tell you what it was called)|`|B5Fm455paa	Lullaby and your should really read Fight Club. The book is even better.|`|c1yfnzuVaa	I have only read a few Chuck Palahniuk books.    I have heard that Fight Club - the book - is amazing and has so much more, plot-wise, especially in the story's end.     Though, my favorite book that I have read from him is probably Invisible Monsters. Its entertaining, weird..well, I guess that describes all his books. Choke was also a pretty good story, but I found that Haunted was too dragged out.|`|L1FL0IcZaa	Fight Club is wonderful. I don't know if I would go as far as to say its better than the movie, but I think the movie is wonderful and I love Edward Norton and David Fincher. I prefer the ending in the book to the ending in the movie, but you can't beat Norton's line, "Marla, you met me at a very strange time in my life."    Invisible Monsters is great too. A lot of Palahniuk's theme's are mirrored between the two. Including the copy of a copy of a copy. It's really interesting.     I have heard Choke and Lullaby are great too. I actually plan on reading them both soon. Also, the movie Choke comes out this year.|`|M5I56DKZaa	from his books that ive read this is my list from favorite to least.    1.

fZF80HYMaa	My high school did not offer any photography classes- just the basic art classes.  I took lots of art though- which helped me to get an eye for my work.  When I wasn't at school or busy with other things I would come home and read photography magazines and study advertisements.  The best thing is to get experience.  Thanks to digital you don't have to pay to be able to experiment with photos like they used to have to- buy film and getting it printed...blah blah...:D  Sad to say, but I do a lot of pictures with just a point and shoot camera.  I am a photographer for the Air Force. But because I am a college student I can't afford a nice camera of my own yet.  I shoot ceremonies and other cool stuff like that, and then my good photos are sent to the pentagon!|`|2TLXfQKDaa	There are a lot of things you can do in preparation for what you'll take in college, but there aren't many if any colleges that will have high school requirements.

Your best bet, if AP photo journalism classes are offered at your high school, is to see what those requirements are.|`|V3b7Bx0iaa	Well learning to spell would be a start (it's college hun).

rVhrVyRGaa	Henry Hudson (1570 to 1611) was an English sea explorer and navigator in the early 17th century. Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Hudson County, New Jersey, Hudson, NY, Hudson Valley and the Hudson River are named after him.     http://www.answers.com/topic/henry-hudso...     Henry Hudson was the English navigator who crossed the Atlantic Ocean in 1609 and became the first European to sail up what is now the Hudson River in New York.    In 1607 he was hired by the English Muscovy Company to lead the ship Hopewell on an expedition north of the European continent, in an effort to discover a northeastern sea passage to the Spice Islands of the South Pacific. He reached Greenland and Spitzbergen before his path was blocked by ice. It was thought at the time that, because the sun shone for three months in the north latitudes, the ice would melt and a ship could travel across the top of the world to the Spice Islands (or the Moluccas--a group of islands of eastern Indonesia between Sulawesi and New Guinea that were discovered in the early 16th century.The islands were settled by the Portuguese but taken in the 17th century by the Dutch, who used them as the basis for their monopoly of the spice trade).  .  On his second voyage a year later, trying to go across the top of Russia ,he made it as far as the archipelago of Novaya Zemlya in the Arctic Ocean. Still convinced that there might be a separate passage to the northeast, the merchants of the Dutch East India Company hired Hudson in 1609 to lead an expedition on the ship Half Moon . He was told to sail around the Arctic Ocean north of Russia, into the Pacific and to the Far East.     Hudson had other ideas, however, and sailed in the other direction, across the Atlantic to North America. He explored along the coast of Nova Scotia and down to what is now New York Harbor, sailing up the Hudson River as far north as Albany. Having heard rumors by way of Jamestown and John Smith, he and his crew decided to try to seek out a Southwest Passage through North America. However, no such route existed until one was created by the construction of the Panama Canal between 1903 and 1914. The Native Americans, who had relayed the information to John Smith, were most likely referring to what are known today as the Great Lakes.    Hudson's fourth voyage, aboard Discovery (1610-11), was financed by English merchants seeking the Northwest Passage across America to the Far East. He made it as far as Hudson's Bay before mutineers put him and eight others (including his son) adrift on a small boat in the bay in June of 1611. Although no record exists of their fate, the men were already sick and without provisions, and it is assumed Hudson and the others did not survive.      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Hudso...     Henry Hudson's life is undocumented prior to his famous voyages, but he is said to have begun as a cabin boy at 16 and gradually worked his way up to ship's captain.  . His  search for a Northeast Passage to China  was clearly influenced by Capt. John Smith, who had corresponded with him and lent him maps. Although nearly a century earlier the Italian navigator Giovanni da Verrazano, sailing in the service of France, had entered New York Bay, Hudson in the Half Moon ascended the river nearly to present-day Albany. The ascent of the river, later named in Hudson's honor, gave the Dutch claim to the area.      (There is a map on the wikipedia site showing his routes)|`|AA10286634	www.answers.com/topic/henry-hudson     The Explorer|`|gW0nD5cEaa	Henry Hudson discovered Manhattan Island and sailed at least part of the way up the river that now bears his name.

Nothing like spending an evening immersing yourself in some Kant. It's very stimulating; well worth the effort. I can categorically say I can't deny the imperative that drives me to love Kant.|`|159d24ded141300e0c13cc0b9dc7f716aa	Certainly there is nothing better than the "Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics." It only requires 50 re-reads to understand.    It is best served with buttered popcorn and gallons of a fine Single Malt Scotch.    On the other hand, as an appreciator of Nietzsche, Kant is worth the hassle to understand. Wear your sunglasses: His mind might burn out your retinas.
2hQFdy08aa	Hahaha, oh boy...    A few recurring motiffs in the story are struggles with impotence (Benjy tries to say, but can't, Quentin is just all around impotent...) there's definitely a large focus on voices and their reliability (the title comes from a shakespeare line, which is: it is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing, but you probably already know that.  Benjy is 33 on Easter, the same age Jesus was when he was crucified.  I'm not sure what that means.  Benjy is really angry in the end because they went the wrong way around the statue of the civil war soldier.  You can think about the civil war soldier as the old ways of the south, and that going the wrong way around it is breaking a long tradition.  The family's father brought up an interesting point about virginity being an invention of men, and a negative state.  If you look at everything the father says with the concept "reducto absurdem" in your mind, you can sometime understand more of Faulkner's purpose.    Benjy's story focuses on the senses.  You can see a big change in Caddy when she stops smelling like trees (which was right after she lost her virginity).  In some ways Benjy is a more reliable narrator because he reports without judging, whereas the other brothers and Dessie are somewhat skewed.      There's a lot of genius in this book.      Unfortunately, a large portion of it went over my head.  Maybe these few threads will help you see more of it xD|`|DvToP5h7aa	The Sound and the Fury - William Faulkner    Study Guides:    http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/soundfury/    http://www.gradesaver.com/classicnotes/t...    http://summarycentral.tripod.com/thesoun...    http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...    http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...

x38sIvyxaa	It depends on your novel's tempo.  If you want the novel to progress quickly, you should probably write a very, very short prologue. This will create a quick-paced 'aura' in your novel.  If you want your novel to progress slowly, your prologue is just about the perfect length (you could even lengthen it by a page or two, if you wanted to). Put some very vague detail in, which will tantalize the reader and make them want to know more--but be incapable of it.|`|qlgti3wKaa	That is perfectly fine. Whatever fits your story. There are no rules to the format of a novel whatsoever, so you're perfectly fine. :)|`|ac0d4c45bf78507770b21657ff6f8f59aa	No. The general rule of lengths for prologues and epilogues are no more than one and half pages.|`|yndz0QbUaa	No, it's fine.  Prologues generally should be short and sweet.|`|lrZSzvxuaa	It's perfectly fine. To me 1-2 pages are more than enough. Besides it is just the prolouge. You shouldn't be that detailed in it.|`|eYwzlsk4aa	it doesn't matter. it's your book, it can be however long you like. just keep it under 4 pages, (for the sake of the reader's interest)|`|zhL83fSlaa	That's fine. No one likes a 50 page prologue.|`|bfw1AtAtaa	I've read prologues ranging from a half a page to about ten pages. One and a half sounds good though, it should work fine!|`|905bf0182abe98289e562ad7fd9c75f8aa	A prologue can be any length. It can be less than a page or more, it depends on what needs to be told in the prologue. If you look at Eragon for example the prologue is a few pages because Paulini has to show the egg before Eragon finds it. If you look at Twilight (No comments please its the first one that came to mind!) the prologue is one page, well technically its only half because she doesn't have to really tell much in that scene. She just has to get the reader hooked.    So really it should fit the length of what needs to be said.     Hope that helps!|`|iwuU48U8aa	as long as u need it to be. Don't limit yourself to things like length just say what you need to in order to set up the stuff you need.    Hope that helps good luck ^_^

yaq7oaH6aa	We have evolved capable of killing to eat, yet we do,   (at least most of us), have a strong reluctance to seriously   hurt a fellow human.  May I suggest some reading on the subject?:   Konrad Lorentz's - "On aggression"  (It's real research by a respected 'pro',    but very readable and informative.|`|ieCuJVZtaa	'God' made us ethical? Please. Ethics and law are defined and refined by society, and our moral standards alter as we become increasingly rational and modern over time. To suggest that religion or God instills morals in people completely discredits all the progress human culture has made in the field of ethics since Aristotle and Plato, as well discredits science, which has shown that we have genes that code for altruism, among other things, and that it is beneficial in hierarchical societies to cooperate with one another rather than fight for survival (among other things as well).    To say anything is 'part of human nature' is already making the question you are trying to ask hard to answer, given the multiple definitions for 'human nature' (and the fact that it is simply an abstract idea used in many different ways for normal conversation).    I'll try to be clear though-- 'killing' is not in human nature. People do what they need to survive, and sometimes that includes 'killing' (This doesn't mean that killing someone else is ethical, even IF someone MUST kill someone else in order to survive) 'Killing' is just one of the many occurrences in show up in human culture-- people kill people who are different from themselves, people kill people who they believe act unethically, people kill people who disagree with them, etc.     To mark 'killing' as being part of human nature is like saying that cooking food is part of human nature. The pressure to eat is very natural, but cooking is simply a cultural phenomenon and a MEANS by which we allow ourselves to eat. Killing is the same-- although it isn't always ethical, and often isn't, it is a MEANS by which we can survive.    Hope I answered your question.|`|ni7Qgt3Raa	There is no such thing as killing . there is only survival against competition .

Morality doesn't enter the picture.|`|dbQHlp85aa	no... unlike other animals.. we have the ability to make decisions based on what we know is right and wrong.|`|9kdUmttPaa	Animals kill and eat each other as a part of the food chain, If you think of humans as animals, meaning sinew, tendons and ligaments, it's easier to think of killing one another. I don't think that it is instilled in us to kill. That goes against the way-dare I say it- God made us.|`|UK0HFbCyaa	It's okay with animals, because typically animals only kill out of protection or out of necessity. Humans, on the other hand, kill for necessity and protection, but also for greed, insanity, and other things that shouldn't justify a murder.    I watched this one Korean action film, with all that sword fighting and martial arts stuff you see. One of the main characters said, "Silly woman! You think the sword is for protecting? Is that how you think humans will use it? No...no...when someone picks up a sword, they think, 'Kill,' they don't think protect. It's in our nature to kill."|`|fGlGg5EUaa	the momemt the food inside your tummy....you already killed other living things.....soooo, this is not a choice, it is a must to do so....|`|15a091aaac1a8ad452d92f5a93d4c2deaa	We all have that potential within us,  but not all of us act on it.
oHO0XOQVaa	Agree with grampathon, not original/interesting enough for that wordy intro.   Does it have to be vampire? Is the whole world just populated with vampires? It could be more interesting if you could make it closer to real life, like some humans with lots of vampires and then explain why there's so many vampires? Could be more interesting if there was a more complicated/mysterious? seeming reason for the division.    Edit: Yes I did read the entire question. So sorry to have assumed that was what your whole story was about. If your story really is more interesting than that then you should include those elements in your intro because right now it's sounding really overdone. Peaceful nation, one rogue, chaos. I looked it up on wikipedia and Vampyre  means vampire. Your name isn't very original as it was already used before, specifically, April 1, 1819 in The Vampyre by John Polidori.|`|CP3F9OK9aa	grampathon is right.

kfOpbbCyaa	Searching hasn't revealed which is the most famous book, but I did find that Marcia Schuyler was the first really big success for Grace Livingston Hill. See http://books.google.com/books?id=n9SZh8e...    All the books you've listed would be familiar to someone who knows about Grace Livingston Hill, but others wouldn't have heard about any of them. (By the way, most of the books of hers I have don't include "Lutz" in her name, though the site above lists that as a part of her name.)

Or you can start with them waking up to the "Get ready for landing" thing and then backstory that.    But the airport idea is fine! I don't think it's over used or cliche.|`|5L6z92Iqaa	Maybe try starting the story off while they are just getting to the Uncles house and the awkwardness of it and then back track a bit and give more detail of their parting with their parents.|`|yiYb9NTraa	You can always start in another place and then flashback to the airport or what ever you want.|`|1L5Uq3voaa	Not that cliche. Could be much worse.|`|s25Dh5RVaa	It is a little cliche. Maybe instead of saying goodbye at the airport, they could say goodbye outside their house? Then have the characters picked up in separate cabs headed in different directions...    If you stick with the airport scene, make it memorable.|`|s3HK7Mv1aa	It's not just about the setting itself... It's -how- you write it.    Even if the airport scene has certainly been done before, if you can write it in a unique, interesting way, then it's not cliche.|`|nui1anxGaa	It's not unusual, but I don't think personally that it's a bad way to start.   If you don't want to be cliched, you could also start out:  -somewhere in the middle of the story, in Ireland (sort of a prologue, then go back to the beginning)  -with an event happening to the uncle in Ireland previous to the characters arriving  -something entirely unrelated to the characters, but relevant to the storyline|`|hE9sghRjaa	Too cliche.

rkKdVDwsaa	Eliminate your own potential for boredom first.    Write a short story. It's manageable and if it's any good it could be expanded into a book.    QUESTIONS  1. What stories do you tell around you friends that make them laugh?  2. What fantasy scenarios have you had in your own life? What heroes have you been?   3. What regrets do you have? What would you have done differently? Write a story where you change the ending to something you fantasize about doing differently.  4. What fears do you have? What would happen if you were trapped inside a mountain? Left in the middle of the ocean? Raped by a group of gangsters? What thoughts would cross your mind? Suppose you survived? How would that change the relationships with people you know? Would you sue someone? Spend the rest of your life trying to kill every gangster and their family? Maybe your invisible character is old now and still after all of them. Or maybe she started an orphanage or went insane. Maybe she scares all the kids in the neighborhood and they say bad things about her in Spanish, calling her a bruja--witch and the invisibleness is a myth. You can go back into her youth and see what was going on. Maybe she was a nerd. You want her to win but she never does. But maybe your reader doesn't know for sure about whether she is really invisible and you keep them guessing all along until they can safely conclude that it's really all a metaphor for how she feels inside. Around this plan I would assemble details from  1, family stories of my own and replace characters with people I really know. It eliminates a lot of the guesswork and having to imagine characters that don't exist. Some of the best authors do this. That's writers have the craziest girlfriends/boyfriends/husband/wives/fri... They never run out of things to talk about.    But back to your question: Entertain yourself first. It works!|`|JnSrN3guaa	who is the main character?  boy or girl?  1st person, or 3rd perspective?  what genre -- horror, thriller, murder, fantasy, action, romance, kids, sci-fi, mystery?  what conflicts does the main character have?  where is the setting located?  do you have any muscial influences to your plot?    :D|`|FLfmkNEAaa	What you want your characters to be like?

Then he starts using the information for evil ...    * A luxury island resort is attacked by a gang of terrorists who take all the hotel's staff and guests hostage.

GLS7vgAdaa	Personally, I've always been fascinated with Robert E. Lee. He was trained at West Point and was good friends with many of the men he fought against in the Civil War. Just as war was breaking out, the newly-elected President Lincoln needed a powerhouse to lead the Union army and asked Lee to do the job. Lee did not support or abide by the idea of slavery. However, he had such a passion for his beloved Virginia that he knew he could never fight in an army that would do any damage to his home. He wrestled greatly with this decision and, of course, ultimately chose to fight for the Confederacy.     That would be my choice. It's a strong person who will stand by his loyalty for his home state, even though, ultimately he didn't believe in a major part of what he was fighting to uphold. Best of luck in your decision.|`|7KcVSB3Uaa	I would choose Lee, but George Washington would be good too. I personally don't think that highly of Booker T Washington, and view him as more detrimental to the cause of civil rights than helpful.    Other good ones from Virginia would be William Faulkner (writer), Ella Fitzgerald (Jazz singer), Benjamin or William Henry Harrison (or really, half of our past presidents), Stonewall Jackson, Meriweather Lewis (of Lewis and Clark), General Douglas MacArthur (a pompous ***, but famous), General George Patton, Pocahontas, and Nat Turner (slave rebellion leader).    Here's a good site with a list, and links to more about each person. Hope this helps!    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_peo...|`|TWMUXDhKaa	I think an article about how Robert E Lee, regardless of what is in textbooks, is a great person.  He is a rather controversial figure in history.  But he stood up against big government.|`|OL2aENUVaa	Well, I'd go with Washington. The first and arguably the best president, he put into place two term limits, warned against political parties, was the only president to run unopposed into two elections, and, to top it all off, he didn't want the job. He is a man of upstanding moral character. And there is TONS of info on him.
fe8563d52b901b702c0e15e3ccfba874aa	As soon as Kant would begin to exert a popular influence, we should find it reflected in the form of a gnawing and crumbling scepticism and relativism; and only among the most active and noble spirits, who have never been able to endure doubt, you would find in its place that upheaval and despair of all truth which Heinrich von Kleist, for example, experienced as an effect of Kant's philosophy. "Not long ago," he once writes in his moving manner, "I became acquainted with Kant's philosophy; and now I must tell you of a thought in it, inasmuch as I cannot fear that it will upset you as profoundly and painfully as me.|`|AA11935914	Among the things that can drive a thinker to despair is the knowledge that the illogical is necessary for man and that much good comes of it. It is so firmly lodged in the passions, in speech, in art, in religion, and generally in everything which endows life with value, that one cannot extricate it without doing irreparable harm to these beautiful things. Only the very naive are capable of thinking that the nature of man can be transformed into a purely logical one..."|`|hAzL7ET8aa	Not long ago, I became aware with the Kantian philosophy and I now have to tell you of a thought I derived from it, which I feel free to do because I have no reason to fear it will shatter you so profoundly and painfully as it has me. We are unable to decide whether that which we call truth really is truth, or whether it only appears to us to be. If the latter, then the truth we assemble here is nothing after our death and all endeavour to acquire a possession which will follow us to the grave is in vain.    This is the quote I hope you're looking for.
K2pdxaadaa	God is not its main concern. There is always overlap, however, depending on the metaphysicist or one using that lens.

LdMixoe2aa	It's because Darwin had discovered years previously (in the 1830s) but had been busy collecting evidence and so hadn't published the theory yet. He was also nervous about publishing as he knew it would be a really controversial theory. Darwin's wife Emma was a devout Christian and I don't think he wanted to offend her in particular as he knew his theory suggested that all life was not created by God, but all inter-related. Wallace didn't discover the theory of Natural Selection until 1858 and didn't have the painstaking research to  back it up.|`|yPwRYXM4aa	From Wikipedia:  Alfred Russel Wallace, OM, FRS (8 January 1823  7 November 1913) was a British naturalist, explorer, geographer, anthropologist and biologist. He is best known for independently proposing a theory of natural selection which prompted Charles Darwin to publish his own theory.    Wallace did extensive fieldwork, first in the Amazon River basin and then in the Malay Archipelago, where he identified the Wallace Line that divides Indonesia into two distinct parts, one in which animals closely related to those of Australia are fairly common, and one in which the species are almost exclusively of Asian origin. He was considered the 19th century's leading expert on the geographical distribution of animal species and is sometimes called the "father of biogeography".[1] Wallace was one of the leading evolutionary thinkers of the 19th century and made a number of other contributions to the development of evolutionary theory besides being co-discoverer of natural selection. These included the concept of warning colouration in animals, and the Wallace effect, a hypothesis on how natural selection could contribute to speciation by encouraging the development of barriers against hybridization.    Wallace was strongly attracted to unconventional ideas. His advocacy of Spiritualism and his belief in a non-material origin for the higher mental faculties of humans strained his relationship with the scientific establishment, especially with other early proponents of evolution. In addition to his scientific work, he was a social activist who was critical of what he considered to be an unjust social and economic system in 19th-century Britain. His interest in biogeography resulted in his being one of the first prominent scientists to raise concerns over the environmental impact of human activity.

yOK32PM9aa	I think the best way to deal with it is to develop compassion for those who display it.  People can lose their compassion for a variety of reasons.  The best advice for a teenager would be to avoid those who are actively hurtful if you can; to recognise that feeling compassionate is very pleasant, so we should cultivate it where wherever we can; and to recognise that those without compassion are unhappy.  Think of them like blind people who keep bumping into us.|`|f2cQrG7jaa	Why resist the lack of compassion? Why deal with it at all? How did you come to the conclusion of zero compassion?

PKhIXkJAaa	You don't need a tutorial. Just mix a  color with a quality oil painting medium to make a transparent wash, then apply it over a dry background.    I use glazing extensively both in oil painting and in acrylic painting.    It's always a good idea to do a preschooler type experiment when using a new technique. Don't try it on anything important at first, just do some experimentation without expectation of creating an artwork. Push it around and see what you can do with it.  That experience will give you skills and confidence.|`|KBqe3rtdaa	First, you must understand what 'Glazing' means.  Glazing is simply doing washes or very light, see-through coats of paint.    You use glazing to gradually change a color or tint or to add dimension to whatever it is that you're painting.    In oil painting, the big deal in glazing is what you use to thin out your paints because different thinners have different qualities.  these qualities range from color to consistency or texture.  I suggest you go to the following website for a good tutorial on oil paint glazing techniques:    http://painting.about.com/od/oilpainting...|`|SqLIZQN5aa	I'm not an expert try this one:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuBP_7If1...  or in HD:  http://vimeo.com/1657763|`|QhRnlB38aa	Here are a couple:   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TK3cYA0fq...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wlP2cb5I...    I have done a lot of research on this and I don't like Liquin for an oil painting medium. I use a walnut oil, spike oil and Canada balsam mixture as my medium. I also glaze using mostly transparent colors, meaning some colors like ultramarine blue and the lakes are naturally transparent. You can almost glaze with them without any extra medium and don't forget scrumbling where you just rub the color out to a thin layer, that makes a layer transparent. Turner used that a lot. Some artists also lay down a large area of glaze and with a sponge or rag dab  up the paint until they get what they want. Well I hope this helps,

The text also gives a breakdown of how and why cults operate as they do; how and why people get recruitted into cults; and how and why people leave cults.|`|GtazNrplaa	I have just finnish "the Bible Fraud" by Tony Bushby but you can take that as it is just another theorist.

I have collected about 30 books on the subject over the years and that doesn't include what I have read at the local library. You can Google cult books and get some idea from the brief descriptions and some of the antidotes on them anyway. So have a go at that anyway for your own interest.    At my age and experience I wouldn't have anything to do with Cults anyway.

0xfVyxxIaa	What a strange question. Exactly what do you mean by a 'fair war'? or do you mean it's only 'fair' if it solely involves Germany and the UK?    If this bizarre requirement is met and assuming you mean in either 'world war' then I would say the UK as it has always maintained a larger navy and inherently has a bigger shipbuilding capacity to maintain this superiority due to its geography. In the second world war Germany could try and win by building an airforce to sink this navy but it would have to be large to overcome the advantages the RAF would hold defending its own airspace and would experience problems deploying itself so far from Germany.    So the most likely scenario would be the Royal Navy sinking the German navy and then destroying its economy through a naval blockade.    And to answer your other odd and irrelevant question I'm from New Zealand.|`|QusqTXCaaa	Germany are among our oldest, and most natural allies.  There has only been two wars, to my knowledge, when we fought against each other, and many more we have fought alongside each other.    WWI, when we found ourselves on opposite sides of military alliances.  Even then, the German head of state, Kaiser Wilhelm II, was the grandson of Queen Victoria.    Have you ever heard of the Christmas truce of 1914?  We refused to fight each other on Christmas Day.  The Germans started it (they always do) but it was they who marched into no mans land unarmed, and shouting at Scots Guards "No shoot tonight, Jock! Sing tonight!."    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9coPzDx6...    WWII, when Germany found itself under the reign of an Austrian nutter called Hitler, who somehow managed to survive 17 attempts by Germans, to bump him off.    The North Africa campaign, which involved soldiers from all over the Commonwealth, has often been dubbed "a war without hate".    http://pasttense.nl/2005/10/23/the-war-w...

Since Britain had ALREADY won the war vs. Hitler, before the AMericans came on the scene.  Hitler did not want to attach Britain by sea, thinking the British navy was all-powerful; and Hitler lost the Battle of Britain in the air, meaning he could not attack by air.  In other words, H. had no meaningful way to invade Britain.    IN short, the phrase 'You'd be speaking German, if it wasn't for us Yanks', just means that if Hitler had won the war...The Brits might choose to take some foreign-language courses, but not much else.|`|hKP5sQewaa	Im from Britain, providing its just Britain v Germany without any of each sides ally joining in, and it was just Britain v Germany, (Today) i would think Germany would win.    Reasons being, they have more people in Germany (more troops)  Things in Germany work (Germans are VERY organized and so is everything in Germany) Were as in british things are a bit patchy.  Germany is run as a country a lot better then Britain.  Also, When Germans turn 17 (about that age i think) they have to do a year in the army training, where as the British don't. So they would have a head start.  Germany Would win in my opinion. (Im British, so this isn't a bias answer)  But it would be a very live costly war! Millions would die, Britain would fortify its island like it did in ww2 and make it so a land invasion would be extremely costly to the German army, the British roil navy is probably better then that of the Germans. But i think in all round, Germany would win, but it would cost the lives of millions on both sides.  That is, of course providing Britain doesn't use its nuclear bombs (of which it has hundreds) as for Germany, im not sure if they have nuclear bombs.    As for WW2, had the Americans not stepped in, Germany would have defiantly invaded Britain, but you must Remember, we had been fighting the Nazis for years, wearing down the German army as well as our own (Britian at the time was the worlds superpower and owned one third of the world and a quater of the worlds population) Just to show how strong the Nazi Army was.    When the Americans join WW2 the Nazis had to fight a 2 front war, it was the Russians if anybody that defeated the Germans, but it was a joined effort between The allies and russia that defeated the germans.    Naz F at the top is either bias or ignorant of History, The British were on the very edge of being taken over by the Nazis just befor the Americans emtered the war, we could bearly defend ourself by the time the americans joined, never mind hold a ofesive.

Whatever interests you have..and...commit to yourself. Make a vow to do the best you can at all times and to be successful or continue to. Then, have a party with your closest friends and family. Take 30 shots of your favorite drink and call it a night. (If after 30 shots you still standing.. LOL.) :-) Enjoy.|`|hneetSf2aa	Cry|`|YmtNel5haa	Specialist?  One who is devoted to a particular occupation or branch of study or research: "Specialists . . . tend to think in grooves" (Elaine Morgan).

Any of several noncommissioned ranks in the U.S. Army that correspond to that of corporal through sergeant first class. -dictionary.com    but if you would like to do something really special you should go out and get a massage, then go out to eat with family, see a movie and have a romantic night at a luxurious hotel with a romance package deal that includes chocolates and champagne.

Dr2NwYhqaa	I do not know how big a life size black mamba is but if it is large, chicken wire is a great frame for paper mache.  If it is smaller, some paper towel rolls covered with tape so that the water does not make it collapse works also.    What you use to make your paper mache will also vary the strength.  You can use a mixture of Elemers glue and water, or wall-paper paste and water, there are many things you can use but pretty much the more water you use the weaker the model will be in the end.|`|bed556c412329f084e39442c54231151aa	I would use snake shaped balloons, as this would be about the right thickness.  Use four or five but do not go over the ends.  Once the balloons are all done, join them together - this should also allow you to put a natural curve in the joins.  When blowing up the balloons, ensure that you blow them up to varying degrees.  Hope this helps.

ji7WZvC1aa	- Anything by Stephen Sondheim but if you haven't heard any of his stuff before, I'd advise starting out with Into the Woods and Sweeney Todd (get the original Broadway cast recordings, not the movie soundtracks!).  Personally Company is one of my favourite Sondheim works, but can be hard going on first listening.  - I'm currently going through a bit of a Cole Porter phase, he just wrote so many wonderful songs.  Anything Goes (the musical, not just the song!) is brilliant.  - You can't go past Les Mis for "hits-you-in-the-heart" music.

AA10725882	I'm not sure they wanted the fort as much as they wanted the union troops out of it.    Fort Sumter was a part of the Charleston harbor defenses.  Union troops and cannons there could have interfered with shipping to the South via Charleston, but the off shore Union naval blockade would accomplish that anyway.    Firing on the fort also pushed several hesitant Southern states to go ahead and secede - especially Virginia which made the secession decision on April 17th - five days after the first shots were fired.  Virginia - April 17, 1861  Arkansas - May 6, 1861  Tennessee - May 7, 1861  North Carolina - May 20, 1861|`|70503caf06f4695beca81e8a95fd439aaa	Fort Sumter was the principle fortress of Charleston harbor, which stands almost perfectly centered at the entrance of the harbor, and is the principle staging ground into Charleston.     When South Carolina seceded, they demanded Fort Sumter be turned over to them as it was an important strategic point which the Federal government was holding for no other reason than as a bargaining tool again Charleston. The Federal Government flatly refused, and the opening shots of the civil war occurred when the South took the fort and opened up Charleston harbor. This is significant because the South realized that, in order to survive, it would need the recognition of the European powers, and that meant naval connection between the Eastern seaboard of the United States and Europe. The North also realized that if the South got the endorsement of the European powers then it was forever doomed to be unable to defeat the south.     Hence the blockade of Charleston and, some suggest, the Emancipation Proclamation as a way of garnering the political support of Europe.
oF2kOKlnaa	Well, in Americas eyes I think they thought it would be the only way to end the 2nd world war.  They dropped the first on Hiroshima thinking this would do it but Japan still stood tall.  Only after the bombing on Nagasaki did Japan finally surrender (reluctantly though).  This was lucky as America only had two of these bombs which clearly Japan did not know.    To answer the question though I think you have to consider the above.  Was it 'just' to bomb a country that had attacked yours?  Of course, you have to protect yourself and the old saying - "An eye for an eye".  The Japanese bombing on Pearl Harbour in 1941 was devastating to America but was an attack on a military base.  However, was it 'just' to drop two deadly bombs on innocent people - ie - two cities.  I think the dropping of the bombs were 'unjust' because of the reason above - the bombing of Pearl Harbour was a military target when the bombing of Hiroshima and  Nagasaki were civilian targets.  As unjust as it were they were probably, in  Americas eyes still necessary to bring an end to the war.|`|nqcnylFpaa	see they bomb pearl harbor but see the city's we bombed also was the dry dock bays that built japans naval fleet so it was a deviating lost but the other plan was to attack Tokyo but an attack on Tokyo would have cost a lot of life's on both sides|`|ooCvJWPHaa	Just.

If you want me to explain more, message me. :)    And just to add-  It was about states, but it was about the southern states right to have slavery and the right for new states to choose. So, the two are intertwined. The issue was states rights, but it was their right to have slaves. ;)|`|lTgGowpOaa	Bleeding Kansas was a big one, but it was mainly about states rights regardless of anyone who says it was about slavery|`|uoBoo8ouaa	The two big ones:  States Rights as opposed to a strong, centralized government  1860 Election (which led to secession)        To reinforce what others are saying about the slavery issue - and I might draw some flak for this - the North's economy was heavily dependent upon slavery to provide a cheap source of raw materials to fuel their industrial complexes.  It's been said that slavery became an issue only later in the war to draw support from the Abolitionists.

rsg0zBT6aa	Murder of the Baron    Let us start our case  By merely stating this:  The detective that was on it,  Surly was the best.    The detective in our story,  Never thrown for any loop,  Was the brilliant man,  Inspector Thomas Jupe.    Our mystery: a murder,  And inheritance disputes.  He was a wealthy man,  Baron Amos Schutts.    Let us join him now,  No, not Schutts, of course,  But inspector Jupe,  Entering through the mansion doors.    Thank you Mr. Jeeves,  For keeping everyone right here.  Make sure no one leaves,  The murderer is near.    While Inspector Jupe inspects the room,  Where Mr. Schutts was shot,  Ill list all visitors here,  And any motives that theyve got.    He had three children visiting,  Though his wife has long been past.  Also here; a nephew,  And a son-in-law for last.    Let us start with his youngest child,  Which is his only daughter.  Married to the son-in-law,  Theyre Mr. and Mrs. Potter.    Mr. Potter lost his job,  And their money was all spent.  Though they begged the greedy baron,  No money had been lent.      His second son, like him,  Was a business man.  But the baron soon found out,  About his deal done under hand.    Though the barons wealth,  Was enormously immense.  He blackmailed his son,  At not a small expense.    His second son was Edward,  If you didnt know.  Now his eldest son;  A gambling man named Joe.    The baron knew he gambled,  And knew he couldnt pay.  So he had lent him money,  In a loan shark sort of way.    The difference with the Potters,  And his gambling son;  The potters would soon pay the debt,  But a gamblers never done.    Now to the youngest of the group,  The nephew Harry Lullan.  He sent the first draft of his novel,  Which Mr. Schutts has stolen.    These are the residents, residing within,  The residence were at.  Also their motives which motivate,  One for this murderess act.    Inspector Jupe has not left,  A single unlocked door.  All of this he has found,  All of this and more.    Tell me, Jeeves, was Mr. Schutts,  In the habit of drinking tea?  Did he drink it in the parlor,  Or in the library?      In this room he had his tea,  Never missed a night, I think.  You know who the culprit is?  Jeeves gave Jupe a wink.    Gather everyone,  Tell them Ill be down.  Tell them to sit tight,  The murderer is found.    He came then down the stairs,  In his solemn sort of way,  Looked them all in the eye,  Before they heard him say:    Mr. and Mrs. Potter,  I know your money troubles.  And of your gambling Joe,  And how your debt it doubles.    I know of blackmail, Edward,  Also of your deals.  Harry heres your novel,  I read it; it appeals.    But the murderer,  Though your motives may be strong,  Is not one of you,  As Ive suspected all along.    Then he turned and looked at Jeeves,  With a twinkle in his eye.  Soon you would be fired,  But did the baron have to die?    Jeeves was stunned and shocked,  But had to face the facts.  Years of loyal service,  And this, my payment back!    Yes I murdered him,  But one thing I cannot see.  How then did you know,  That the murderer was me?      The teapot in his room was full,  As if murdered in the night.  The newspaper though, on which it sat,  Ran todays date up in the right.    You had told me you had found him,  When the morning came.  When I saw the paper,  I doubted then your claim.    Plus its pretty obvious,  I practically have said it.  Its such a classic answer,  That The butler did it.     By Ezekiel Willerson|`|2e9c854d8d83fa809b7459c01c1084ffaa	Yes, I wrote "The Purple Cow"...  I'm sorry now I wrote it.  But I can tell you anyhow,  I'll kill you if you quote it.

But take away law enforcement from modernized metropolitian areas, and there would be chaos.|`|D6ceAZ4raa	it would be greatly higher but after a while i believe people would inforce their own self-governing, because people can only be so evil before their self-realization kicks in. but where there is a lack of enforcment there will always be corruption.|`|zfRiM2J2aa	Natice Americans that first came to the United States were governed by behaviors they governed their people by behaviors and while they gathered with their community to be close through rituals like songs and dance and customary things. If one of these people were to steal something from someone else all that would truly take place is to shame that person til they were purified.  The Europeans on the other hand has such things as the councils to place you to jail and make you pay for your crimes.  To this question I'm sure that I I would say that I don't trust many or alot of people other than what I see and what I can feel in my intutions and common sense and trusting myself in my own judgements. And keeping myself in a happy place.  awesome place.  So if anybody was to interfere with that awesome place in me I suppose I would not be happy and that I would kill someone.  ( just teasing ) but I would not let anyone rip me off!! so yes I believe that courts, police, law enforcements are great to have. thank god!! and   abiding the law is also about respect.   bettyd|`|fWmhJa86aa	I dont think so, and this is why. Has anyone every told to not to touch something because it was hot, but you touched it anyway. Rather than if they never told you, you might have not thought about it. I do believe crime would still happen, just not as much. Alot of crime that happens is put into motion by the police for example drugs, there is a lot of police to put the drugs back on the street to make extra money on the side. I just think things could be a lot different with out them, just dont know if it would good or bad|`|KXiwLOtOaa	Personally I don't think so. After all would you kill anyone just because you could get away with it. Man would likely become more homebound and territorial but in the long term I think it would work out. Law enforcement is after all a fairly recent developement. I doubt a world without government would kill as many people as say world war two did. But hey I am an anarchist we are an evil bunch.|`|UY6c7DG8aa	Yes.  there are just too many greedy people out there who knows no self-control, and too many ignorant people out there who doesn't know the goods of following the rules.  If everyone is smart enough, the answer to this question will be no.  But we're not.  ANd that's why law enforcements are there.|`|AA11442722	Depends on the society involved. When people grow up with strong taboos against what are considered crimes few break them. Especially if they know a lynch mob is going to find them if they do.     The primary role of law enforcement really is to isolate the suspect protecting them until true guilt or innocence can be discovered. Far too often circumstances point to the wrong person. Unfortunately cops are quick to pick up on circumstance. The wrongful conviction rates on crimes where DNA can clear up or convict people are hovering around %40. Which means 4 out of every 10 people sent to prison for such crimes and even sometimes executed were innocent of the crimes they were charged with.     Cops cannot prevent most crimes. Don't even discourage them in the least in most cases. Park a cop in a bank and most bank robbers plan for the cop in the bank for example.     Cops go after what is easy to enforce. Speeding is rarely dangerous unless no respect is given for curves, the person is not paying attention to traffic or is going faster than weather conditions and the vehicle combined can be safely operated. Going the speed limit is sometimes dangerously fast in certain vehicles under certain conditions. My favorite example is mini-vans which are very prone to roll overs and which have a very high wind profile. Even going the speed limit on a windy day can be dangerously fast in a mini-van. A sports car could safely do 100 mph on the same day. Yet when roads are slick or icy that same sports car because it is so light has to drive slower than the mini-van which will have better traction in such conditions if it's not windy. What is dangerous is cutting others off. That is the 2nd most common cause of fatal accidents. Dozens die from unsafe lane changes to people who are killed by anything other than running red lights. Yet have you ever met somebody who got a ticket for an unsafe lane change? For entering the freeway at a speed so slow it's a hazard to traffic? Nope because it's easy to sit around with a radar gun. It's easy to go after the pot dealer on the corner than to try to track down the herion dealer who is a real hazard. Easier to wait for somebody to get stopped for a minor traffic infraction and then find something else to get them for than to actually deduce what is a potential crime going on.     So law enforcement does little to prevent or solve crimes, does a great deal to create it. Especially the way they are trained which is to be extremely aggressive. Frequently they enter a situation and wind up arresting people completely uninvolved just because they take a tense situation and make it worse. Most cop shootings either the cop or the suspect or both who gets shot are situations where an aggressive cop caught the wrong person on the wrong day and took a law abiding citizen and pushed it too far.     Nothing can replace internal values in the prevention of crime. When the cops are unpopular or the law they enforce is unpopular the people close ranks around the "criminals" and the cops are blocked from enforcement. What is effective is people around the victim stepping in and helping out. This is both the most effective deterrent and solution.|`|E70A7aqcaa	Experience living in cities has shown me that without law enforcement, and I mean MEANINGFUL law enforcement, crime would be outrageously high.  One noted city with the numbers to prove my point is Dallas.  Look back in the late 1960's when their murder rate was actually the highest in the country, until the Dallas Police Department initiated their "Shotgun Squad".  Once that was in force, the murder rate and robbery of convenience stores dropped like a rock to the lowest in the country, and then when the liberal city council banned the Shotgun Squad because the "disenfranchised" complained that too many of their people were being killed (because they were the ones robbing the convenience stores), the robbery and murder rate instantly skyrocketed to pre-Shotgun Squad days.  And all this was prior to SWAT.  God Bless you.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	If the law didn't protect it, what would you   do to the local Motor Vehicle Bureau?

JvmYeqH6aa	Hi Kate_dancer21!    Here is another suggestion -    Go talk to the Dance Teacher!!!!!    Just explain your situation!    You are DETERMINED to learn how to Dance (we need people like YOU in classes - it motivates the other students) - he or she will like that.    Explain you are low on money - or just plain don't have any - but are willing to work - if you have it.    Maybe He or She will let you in - on the first 10 lessons  .  .  . it don't hurt to ask.    Worthy students - are just that  .  .  . worthy. No fault of their own - if there isn't enough money  .  .  .  .  . sometimes importance, and worthy causes - are NOT about money. (I always have taught a few on the side for free  .  .  . why? Because they were Serious about learning!    Try this. Just go talk to the teacher. You never know  .  .  . maybe there are things around the Dance Studio - they need help on  .  . and you could earn your own lessons!    Here is another suggestion. Can you Iron clothes?    There is always a doctor, Lawyer - or business professional who needs ironing done - has had a bad experience with the local cleaner  .  . and is looking to pay someone to wash and iron their shirts!    Small idea - that can really generate some big dollars. Plus - they begin to be regular customers - so the extra $90.00 a week is handy!    Sure hope this helps!    Don't give up! Be determined - and you WILL find a way!    This time next year - you'll be the expert - giving other beginners advice  .  .  . just watch and see!    Good luck - and GO FOR IT!!!|`|pbMpMRmLaa	i am a competitive dancer myself so I can understand how you must feel to not have anyone support you with your passion. my mom and dad come to all my shows and competitions and i think you should talk to your parents and explain to them one last time that dance is what you want to be doing. but dance can be expensive so the most i can say is that try working at the studio for tuition. there is a program at a place i know where you clean up the place in exchange for classes. good luck :]|`|kqo66pbeaa	Sorry about your situation.  Umm..I think that there are plenty of after school program type things that are free for you.|`|Wci8jx1Faa	In our neighborhood, we have a group in which we raise money for the environment... basically. So you can do things like wash cars, rake leaves, and etc. We get our big money off of like these "festivals" where we sell stuff that was in our junk piles and such. Also, we do other activities that encourage them to donate. Paying 25 cents to play a game and earn a "lottery" if they win is good.|`|qHUcyrytaa	You really need to try to talk with your family. If they don't support you and won't let you work to get the money they probably won't let you go to dance class even if you could pay for it. Have you tried dancing for them and showing you are truly passionate about dancing. Maybe they would see how much it means to you and either pay for it or let you get a job to pay yourself to go. Good luck.|`|sEDrP9uSaa	I knew a girl who worked at the front desk of the dance studio and was a teacher's assistant for some of the younger classes in exchange for dance classes. Maybe you could check with your dance studio and see if you could do something like that.    Babysitting is also an option, if your parents would let you.|`|WpDISIzRaa	save pocket money. but better explain your parents that they are idiots... it's not like doing drugs.. it's like they stay in the way of your future.|`|9it971Uiaa	try babysitting,  you will be surprised how much money you can get, especially in the summer.  parents are always looking for someone to watch there young children why they go to work.

DA is my cup of tea, and though I wish it had some things that flickr did, DA does a pretty decent job overall and they get my vote.|`|bocePfyYaa	What do you mean store photography?

For a b/w it's a bit plain, and the depth of field doesn't make it any more appealing.

jgimpZSpaa	I want to go into animation and visual effects and I love manga!  but im not that great at it  so....practice is what it takes..but ur right..u need something to look off of at first  thats how most artist start out..they copy tons of pictures when they are little until they develop their own style which is usually a compilation of a bunch of things they have already seen  so....get on youtube....and type in what you want to start practicing on  u can start with the body, head, eyes, feet, legs...whatever..and draw that over and over  i suggest the body...then move to head and facial features...then clothes......  clothes are so fun!  http://www.youtube.com/user/markcrilley  this is manga...but its pretty sweet...he has tons of tips  u freeze it and just copy it ...then try to recreate it without looking throughout the day when ur doodling.....and after you mastered one picture...try your own styles with it|`|EJJMXnf0aa	Take a drawing class for anime|`|2TLXfQKDaa	Practice Practice PRACTICE!    It really does work.  If you want an idea of what to practice decide what it is about anime you like.  Eyes, a particular artists style, hair patterns, architectural depiction.    When you know what it is you like, practice at achieving that same result.  If you have problems coming up with your own ideas, don't bother.  Try to copy an image, all of the details as best you can.    It will all be fairly tough if you don't have a grip on the basics.  Hardness of lines - when to use light sweeping strokes, or short heavy ones.      Some people are gifted at putting what they see in their head to the paper.  Some people aren't, that doesn't mean you can't do it, but practice friggin helps.  If you are having troubles, using reference materials is fine too.  People say practice, because in a single word that's what it takes.    Good luck!
tzC4kXmoaa	That is really hard to find!  At my school we tried to shows.  They were called School Days, which was a combination of skits about things teens go through.  The roles can be changed from male to female when needed.  Another is called The Foolish Decision.  It is about a girl who falls for the popular guy, but at the end realizes her geeky friend Norman is right for her.  It's cute and funny and touches on drugs and alcohol.  I wouldn't suggest Shakespeare, though, because it is very difficult for young performers and some shows are a little sketchy.     Hope all goes well!!          P.S.

O3k4t0i9aa	The Jews, Gypsies, Poles, handicapped, and others Hitler was persecuting hid so they could have a better chance at escaping Hitler's Nazi rule and living a better life. Some hid because they were hoping the war would end and they could return to a normal life once Hitler was defeated. Others hid, not because they were the persecuted, but because they had been caught hiding the persecuted. Life during the Holocaust was extremely dangerous, and to this day no one's really sure which was worse: to be one of the hunted, or to be the one protecting the hunted.

Tangled Up In Blue    Early one mornin' the sun was shinin',  I was layin' in bed  Wond'rin' if she'd changed at all  If her hair was still red.  Her folks they said our lives together  Sure was gonna be rough  They never did like Mama's homemade dress  Papa's bankbook wasn't big enough.  And I was standin' on the side of the road  Rain fallin' on my shoes  Heading out for the East Coast  Lord knows I've paid some dues gettin' through,  Tangled up in blue.    She was married when we first met  Soon to be divorced  I helped her out of a jam, I guess,  But I used a little too much force.  We drove that car as far as we could  Abandoned it out West  Split up on a dark sad night  Both agreeing it was best.  She turned around to look at me  As I was walkin' away  I heard her say over my shoulder,  "We'll meet again someday on the avenue,"  Tangled up in blue.    I had a job in the great north woods  Working as a cook for a spell  But I never did like it all that much  And one day the ax just fell.  So I drifted down to New Orleans  Where I happened to be employed  Workin' for a while on a fishin' boat  Right outside of Delacroix.  But all the while I was alone  The past was close behind,  I seen a lot of women  But she never escaped my mind, and I just grew  Tangled up in blue.    She was workin' in a topless place  And I stopped in for a beer,  I just kept lookin' at the side of her face  In the spotlight so clear.  And later on as the crowd thinned out  I's just about to do the same,  She was standing there in back of my chair  Said to me, "Don't I know your name?"  I muttered somethin' underneath my breath,  She studied the lines on my face.  I must admit I felt a little uneasy  When she bent down to tie the laces of my shoe,  Tangled up in blue.    She lit a burner on the stove and offered me a pipe  "I thought you'd never say hello," she said  "You look like the silent type."  Then she opened up a book of poems  And handed it to me  Written by an Italian poet  From the thirteenth century.  And every one of them words rang true  And glowed like burnin' coal  Pourin' off of every page  Like it was written in my soul from me to you,  Tangled up in blue.    I lived with them on Montague Street  In a basement down the stairs,  There was music in the cafes at night  And revolution in the air.  Then he started into dealing with slaves  And something inside of him died.  She had to sell everything she owned  And froze up inside.  And when finally the bottom fell out  I became withdrawn,  The only thing I knew how to do  Was to keep on keepin' on like a bird that flew,  Tangled up in blue.    So now I'm goin' back again,  I got to get to her somehow.  All the people we used to know  They're an illusion to me now.  Some are mathematicians  Some are carpenter's wives.  Don't know how it all got started,  I don't know what they're doin' with their lives.  But me, I'm still on the road  Headin' for another joint  We always did feel the same,  We just saw it from a different point of view,  Tangled up in blue.

Materials and labour costs would differ from region to region and company to company.

AA11236094	What is your question, Kate?    If you want the free verse to sound cadenced, like Eliot or Whitman or Auden, then I suggest you read it aloud, changing perhaps a single word at a time and then rereading it.    If you are unsure that you have achieved what you intended, then you might try writing a completely new verse, and comparing the two.  Sometimes, this clarifies things for you, and occasionally lights the way to a new poem.    Please clarify and we'll try to offer more help, and good luck.

DenLZAL1aa	The American pioneer Stephen Fuller Austin (1793-1836) was the chief colonizer of Texas. With the exception of Utah, no other state so owes its existence to one man.    Born in Austinville, Wythe County, Va., on Nov. 3, 1793, Stephen Austin moved to Missouri in 1798, where his father, Moses Austin, engaged in lead mining and land speculation. Stephen attended Colchester Academy in Connecticut and Transylvania University in Kentucky before returning home. In Missouri he served in the state legislature from 1814 to 1820, was a director of the Bank of St. Louis and an officer in the state militia, and became active in lead mining, land speculation, and manufacturing.    When the Panic of 1819 bankrupted the family enterprises, Austin moved to Arkansas, where he was appointed a district judge. In August 1820 he moved again, seeking in Louisiana a means of making enough money to repay the family's debts. In New Orleans he read law and worked on a newspaper.    His father died in June 1821, leaving Austin a newly acquired permit to colonize 300 families in Spanish Texas. He traveled to Mexico City in 1822-1823 to secure Mexican recognition of the Spanish grant. This done, he colonized the 300 families, as well as an additional 750 families under subsequent contracts.    Small of stature, lean and wiry, with fine features, thick hair, and brown eyes, Austin was a dignified and reserved man. A bachelor given to self-analysis, he led the Texan colonists by means of his forceful personality and persuasive writings. He mapped and surveyed much of Texas, translated Mexican laws, fixed the land system, and served as civil and military liaison with the Mexican authorities. He also organized the Texan defenses against the Indians.    In 1833 he journeyed to Mexico City to represent the Texan desire for separate statehood. He was arrested on charges of sedition and imprisoned, but never tried. Released in 1835, he returned to Texas, where he joined the faction fighting the dictatorship of Antonio Lpez de Santa Ana. At the outbreak of the fighting, he became commander in chief of the Texan military forces, but in November 1835 he was sent to the United States to seek assistance and, later, recognition of independence.    At the end of the Texas revolution, he reluctantly ran for president of the new republic against the hero of the war, Samuel Houston. Defeated, Austin accepted the position of secretary of state in the Houston administration. He died on Dec. 27, 1836, of pneumonia. His quiet, effective leadership during the years 1821-1836 is recognized in numerous ways in Texas; the capital city, a county, and a college are named in his honor. His statue in the national capitol was placed there by grateful citizens of the Lone Star State.    Further Reading    Eugene C. Barker's standard The Life of Stephen F. Austin (1925) depicts in detail the career of this remarkable colonizer and places him in the context of American history. David M. Vigness, The Revolutionary Decades, 1810-1836 (1965), traces Austin's career in the Texas revolution. Most of the known writings by Austin are contained in Eugene C. Barker, ed., The Austin Papers (3 vols., 1924-1928).    Additional Sources    Warren, Betsy, Moses Austin and Stephen F. Austin: a gone to Texas dual biography, Dallas, Tex.: Hendrick-Long Pub. Co., 1996.    Austin, Stephen F. (Stephen Fuller), Fugitive letters, 1829-1836: Stephen F. Austin to David G. Burnet, San Antonio, Tex.: Trinity University Press, 1981.

AA10744471	The name Oklahoma comes from the Choctaw phrase okla homma, literally meaning red people. Choctaw Chief Allen Wright suggested the name in 1866 during treaty negotiations with the federal government regarding the use of Indian Territory, in which he envisioned an all-Indian state controlled by the United States Superintendent of Indian Affairs. Equivalent to the English word Indian, okla humma was a phrase in the Choctaw language used to describe the Native American race as a whole. Oklahoma later became the de facto name for Oklahoma Territory, and it was officially approved in 1890, two years after the area was opened to white settlers.

qPT4pSlraa	I have this exact same project due for my teacher :)    Mountain Men knew the land and would guide people through wilderness, they also asked for something in return most often supplies. Marco Polo was a traveler and a trader, who traveled the silk road from China to Europe.    so basically:  -both traded for goods  -both expanded in search of lands to travel and routes to discover      Age of Discovery was when Europeans explored the oceans searching for goods   while Manifest Destiny was when people wanted to expand towards the west.     so basically:  -searched lands   -expanded     you can see that the four topics all tie together, so in general the all expanded, traded, and explored.       Hope I helped.|`|xJoMSkI5aa	Similarities:    1. You have conquerors and those conquered. Remember that when the Spanish conquistadors came in the Americas, the Indians suffered (Columbian exchange). The same dynamic worked with manifest destiny where the Indians were pushed from their lands.    2. Both had economic drivers. In the Age of Discovery, explorers were seeking new trade routes. One driver of manifest destiny was miners and markets.    3. Both has dramatic effects on the environment. In the Age of Discover and the time of Manifest Destiny, the environment took a big hit.

cua3iiqIaa	well you see Germany was very affected by the Great Depression and also very humiliated by the Treaty of Versailles so things were very unstable. Hitler came to power by telling the German people that their race, the Aryans, were the perfect people, and all the rest were vermin. Hitler promised to regain control of the territory lost in the Treaty of Versailles, but when he started going into war he went all out. It started slowly and slowly, Germany needed someone to put the blame on, so they  chose people not of pure German descent, and blamed them for the loss in WW1 and saying that they were wasting Germany's money and led them to depression. So hitler started with throwing Jews into the ghettos at first, it didnt seem so bad because he didnt tell them it was a ghetto, it was "relocation" and all their things where to be "taken care of" (burned). The conditions in the ghettos were terrible and after this, Hitler just lost it and really had no other option but to keep going with his theory that the non pure germans are the problem and made things worse for them. Eventually, they started to take jews to concentration camps to work, the strong and healthy could work to create weapons for the soon to be WW2 and the weak and elderly were disposed of, first they were buried, but there was no room to bury them all so they started to burn them. Also, this was not stopped by countries like Britain, France, and the US because they all wanted to avoid another war, so they let Germany have some land back. Intolerance and racism was also shown because Hitler made other jews do the terrible things to their fellow jews, like shave eachothers heads, collect each others clothing, check value of items that were taken from their homes, etc.    This is all i can think of atm, i just finished a history course last semester so its kinda fresh :D    btw this is not cheating as long as you take this info and make it into your own words, you wont be stealing my work, but learning from it and creating your own

AA11236094	Never give up, for if you do it is your own life you are crippling.    Langston Hughes is the greatest poet of the movement known as the Harlem Renaissance.      You should compare it to his other poem on dreams:      A Dream Deferred       What happens to a dream deferred?  Does it dry up  Like a raisin in the sun?  Or fester like a sore--  And then run?  Does it stink like rotten meat?  Or crust and sugar over--  like a syrupy sweet?  Maybe it just sags  like a heavy load.  Or does it explode?

f595f51912c467d68eab3d0fedf6e468aa	I'm still trying to find the "scratch" or "dent" in one of the guitars they sent me. The funny thing is, in addition to the gig bag that came with it, they sent along a hard-sided case AT NO CHARGE!!!    Don't hesitate. They are a great company and I've never had a single complaint to file with them. Everything I've ever ordered arrived before they said it would.    Even if there is a scratch/dent somewhere, big deal. They aren't going to ship you something they'll have to take back. Not only that, but then you don't have to dread that first "ding" because it's already there! I would count on having to get a set-up though, because many from-the-factory set-ups have the action way too high.    Kabum|`|yBrKP2sFaa	It means they may have a tiny scratch or dent or minor flaw that dosn't effect the quality of the sound and playing. It's worth it dude.

BBfIXcI0aa	It doesn't take much - keep their breasts down with wrapping tape or a couple of sports bras (NOT duct tape or anything that restrictive). Put them in clothes that minimise curves. If they have especially full lips, put just a touch of foundation or concealer on them. A bit of bronzer or eye shadow just a touch darker than their skin along the jawline can create the illusion of possible hair growth on the horizon. Long hair can be tucked up into caps, or put in a ponytail at the very nape of the neck.

AA10729675	The Hebrews had been made captive and transported to Mesopotamia.  They were freed by Antiochus III a Seleucid whom the Bible praises as a liberator.  Jews had been made captive in Egypt also.  As slaves, they were building pyramids and such, and palaces and such in Mesopotamia: free labor!|`|yQNit56Qaa	Bunches and bunches....a book could probably be written about this.    Abraham was from Mesopotamia.  He was the first "Hebrew" and the ancestor of the Jews.    Abraham's descendants - those who were the immediate ancestors of the Jews - married women from Mesopotamia.    The Assyrians - who deported the entire population of the Kingdom of Israel - were from Mesopotamia.    The Samaritans were probably originally from Mesopotamia (relocated to Israel by the Assyrians).    The Babylonians - who deported most of the population of the Kingdom of Judah and destroyed the first temple - were from Mesopotamia.    These are the major points, I think.  There is a whole lot more detail, though.  Also, the Persians (who permitted the rebuilding of the temple) and the Seleucids (who ruled Judea until the Herodian dynasty successfully rebelled) could rightly be called Mesopotamians....

1hvrQYWiaa	The Agricultural Revolution of the late 18th century led to a marked increase in the food supply,which fuelled a parallel growth in population of Europe.   Also,army recruitment in the Napoleonic era was very different to that of the previous 2 centuries.The French Republic after the Revolution instituted a levee en masse - all men were simply drafted into the army and sent off to fight.Napoleon used a well organized system of conscription both in France and in occupied and satellite states to raise and maintain armies;this system was copied by some other European powers.   It's worth remembering that apart from Spain,the French did not conduct any land campaigns in 1810 and 1811, so Napoleon did not 'suddenly' send 500,000 men into Russia in 1812.Also,about 40% of this army was from Allied or satellite countries,and therefore not French.|`|brUt1Fupaa	Napoleon didn't just get his soldiers from France -- some of them came from vassal states, particularly in Germany.

KBqe3rtdaa	Acrylics can be used with an airbrush, but you must make allowances for their special characteristics.    First, be aware that acrylics dry VERY quickly.  Therefore, before you thin them, you must cut them with something called RETARDER.  This will slow the drying time.      The more retarder you use, the slower the drying time.  I suggest using an equal amount of retarder as paint.  And for airbrushing, you really need very little paint -- a dab from the paint tube that's the size of your thumbnail should be sufficient.    Then, after mixing with retarder, add water gradually until the paint flows almost as easily as water.  Load your airbrush and go.    As soon as you're finished, wash out your equipment with dishwashing liquid and hot water.  then rinse well with water.  If you wait, the paint will dry in your equipment and you'll have a heck of a time removing it.    Good luck!|`|Gc4UX1Mhaa	Not the right medium for air brush.    In general, water is what you use to thin out acrylic paint as it is water-based.  But it could get lumpy and clog nozzles up...... don't recommend it.  Also, unlike watercolor, once it is dried, it does not dissolve in water.  There are some retarders that you can use to slow down the drying rate.|`|dKrLAJaEaa	dangerous proposition...talk to an expert or risk destroying your equipment.

But, I would double check with your teacher first, to make sure you understand the "tension" issue. Immigrants took jobs away from Americans, some thought. They did not learn our language until second or third generations. They had their own customs that were "different" and therefor unAmerican.  In 1921, Congress enacted a law limiting annual immigration to the US to 350,000 people per year. Each year, European nations could send to the US a number equal to 3 percent of its nationals who were in the US in the year 1910. In 1924, Congress amended the immigration law and reduced the number of immigrants to 150,000, and the quota to 2 percent, and the base year to 1890. This law favored immigration from nations like Great Britain, but discriminated against central and eastern European nations like Poland, Russia and Syria.

EBrgRBT3aa	America landed on the moon.    THE STORY:    On 16 July 1969, half a million people gathered near Cape Canaveral (then Cape Kennedy), Florida. Their attention was focused on three astronautsNeil A. Armstrong, Edwin E. Aldrin Jr., and Michael Collinswho lay in the couches of an Apollo spacecraft bolted atop a Saturn V launch vehicle, awaiting ignition of five clustered rocket engines to boost them toward the first lunar landing. This event took place eight years after President John F. Kennedy, in the wake of Soviet Sputnik and Vostok successes, issued a challenge to land men on the moon before 1970 and thus give the United States preeminence in space exploration. After twenty manned missionstwo to the vicinity of the moon itselfthe National Aeronautics and Space Administration was ready to achieve that goal.    At 9:32 A.M., the Apollo 11 crew fired the 200,000-pound-thrust Saturn S-IVB stage to escape earth's gravitational field. On their way to the moon, the astronauts monitored systems, ate, and slept. Several times via television they showed scenes of the receding earth and their own cabin activities.    Early Saturday afternoon (19 July), the crew slowed their ship while on the back side of the moon to enter lunar orbit. Following this maneuver, Aldrin slid through a passageway into the lunar module, called Eagle, to test its systems and then returned to the command module Columbia so that he and the other crew members could sleep before the descent to the lunar surface.    On Sunday, Armstrong and Aldrin cut loose from the command module and headed toward the surface of the moon. Armstrong set the craft down at 4:17 P.M. (EDT), reporting, "Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed." Six and one-half hours later, after donning a protective suit and life-sustaining backpack, Armstrong climbed down and set foot on lunar soil, saying, "That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind." Aldrin soon followed. Half a billion people watched on television as the two astronauts moved about on the lunar surface with its gravity one-sixth that of earth's.    While on the Sea of Tranquility, Armstrong and Aldrin deployed a television camera, raised the American flag, collected about forty-seven pounds of samples, talked with President Richard M. Nixon, set up scientific equipment, and gave millions of listeners a description of their experiences. After two hours of exploring, they returned to the lunar module, rested for eight hours, and then started the engine of the ascent stage to rejoin Collins, who was orbiting the moon in Columbia, late Monday afternoon. Discarding the Eagle, the astronauts fired the service module engine shortly after noon the next day to escape the lunar gravitational field for the return to earth.    Apollo 11 splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on Thursday, 24 July, a week and a day (195 hours) after departing the Florida launch site. The astronauts, greeted by Nixon aboard the U.S.S. Hornet, were kept in quarantine for sixteen days because scientists feared the introduction of pathogens from outer space    ANSWER|`|BUKgRWT8aa	we went to the mooooooon|`|9dcd19c7dec39b3d7b8127a4328d3eccaa	Landing on the moon

Stretch every day, but don't push it too much or you'll just end up hurting yourself. A couple of stretches you can do:  - Sit on the floor with your back straight and your legs open as wide as you can. Lean forward, keeping a flat back (if it curves, you defeat the purpose of the exercise).  - At the barre (or something of similar height you can get your leg onto), put one foot up and slide that leg as far along as you can.  - Position yourself in something of a lunge, but with your back leg straight. Get as low as you can, then inch your front foot forward and hold.    Don't know about the push ups, I'm afraid.

Spending trillions of dollars - all borrowed - is more likely to make matters worse than make them better.|`|c31167b5e58f12167c6e09e90c2a0f0caa	The Reagan tax cuts took effect in 1983 and stimulated the economy.  Income tax rates and capital gains taxes were lowered.  Simple as that.|`|ac815d08d535e731adb9a4dce003e9eeaa	The recession in the early 80's was no where near as bad as our present situation.|`|94bc2dec827aab848ba69cb5895f7ba6aa	The deficit was increased from about 70 million (no misprint - million) in 1980, to 220 milion in 1986.    Analysts found the effects of the deficit helpful, as private investment increased when deficits rose; since investors saw increased demand (more opportunity) as a result.    Another way to stimulate the economy was to lower interest rates.  There was ample room to do this, since interest rates were very high (due to an event called the Volcker shock---Paul Volcker, of the US Treasury deliberately created a sudden spark in interest rates, to choke off inflation.  At one time, you could get 19% for a one year term deposit.).  However, now that interest rates are low to begin with, lowering interest rates would not have much effect.    The Regan tax-cuts had little effect in stimulating the economy, as these happened BEFORE the recession, when unemployment was already in decline.  In fact, during the recession, Regan actually chose to increase corporate taxes.    Re deficit:  http://economics.about.com/od/useconomic...  http://www.applet-magic.com/rec1980.htm  Re Regan tax-cuts  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_1980s...|`|AA11442722	The recession is about the same as  measured right this moment. but we slipped into it much slower than we did this one. The 80s recession hit certain areas of the country much harder than others.     We did the opposite in the 80s. We cut spending instead of increasing it. The primary cause of the 80s recession was actually the massive spending and runaway inflation caused by that spending in the late 70s.     The biggest factor that pulled us out of the 80s recession was the buy American wave that took over America. Walmart grew tremendously by pursueing a policy of selling only American made products. Many other  companies thrived by being vendors of American only products as well.
AA11442722	The determined culture was the primary thing. Adaptability was the other. The Romans borrowed whatever they found which worked better than what they had before. When they ceased to borrow ideas from other cultures the Roman culture atrophied and died.     Rome devleoped advanced military technology and tactics which allowed them to defeat all comers until the Steppe tribes baffled them. Rome had lost it's flexibility by then. Previous enemies Rome adapted to beat.     Roman technology was the most advanced in the world. Much of it was borrowed and improved by Romans but it allowed Rome to be centuries ahead of other cultures.     Rome devleoped a free society which allowed those assimilated to rise up even to the top ranks. While this was true Roman culture ruled the world.|`|kyW65qLxaa	I Live in Rome and believe me that you won't find any other place with our History.

"The pigs created are given names and personalities and wardrobes. Phoebe Gilman's warm detailed illustrations make it easy to see how these books became Canadian classics so quickly and have such lasting appeal. Half the fun in the first reading (and there will be many) comes in identifying the pigs as you deduce which is George with the girlfriend and who is Miranda with the red cheeks and long, dark eyelashes.         When the time comes to sell the pigs, Jillian realizes that she can't part with any of her creations, but she soon comes up with a solution: she will teach other kids how to make pigs. "Instructions for making a "wonderful pig" follow at the end of the book in clear simple instructions with tips on how to come up with all the variations and characters found in the book."

7LhGfkrOaa	Hinton used her initials to because she didn't want to isolate potential male viewers because she's a female.  She then decided to stick with the intials to seperate her public life from her private life.    She started to write while still in high school as an outlet because her father died of cancer.  For the most part, writers use their surroundings as their settings and its hard for them to deviate because thats what they know best.  Sorta like M. Night Shalayman always sets his movies in Philadelphia.  Because she was still in high school and Outsiders was her first story, her high school life was an easy topic and the dividing gangs Greasers and Socs were based on real life.  Because she was successful, she chose not to mess with success and so all her stories focus on young adults.  You also see plenty of her characters overlap from one story to another (ie Ponyboy, Dally, Tim Sheppard, etc)|`|DvToP5h7aa	Official Book & Movie Website    http://www.theoutsidersbookandmovie.com/    Additional Biographical Information.    http://www.sehinton.com/    http://www.answers.com/topic/s-e-hinton    http://www.carr.org/mae/hinton/hinton.ht...    http://title3.sde.state.ok.us/library/it...|`|ye6IiFr7aa	omg r u reading the outsiders?!!?!|`|nprzHREiaa	Well she used her initials i think so that boys and girls will both read her books.

tKFO3u60aa	hmm...you think most would assume murder is female? i would have said male...weird. i guess neither gender wants another bad connotation.   Okay, I think that Mr. Murder could be either tall or short, probably slender, not bad looking, either very handsome or generally good/interesting looks. friendly, everybody wants to be respected by him...hard party guy but has a soft side that his good friends like to think is because of them and his love/respect for them but he's actually a self-devoted person who puts up the ultimate facade to those around him. He is quick to anger, but romantic and seems sensitive. I guess he's the ultimate deceiver, the man who knows what you want him to be and delivers it. Someone totally oblivious and skin deep would find him great but no one's really like that.|`|FoIxsunVaa	He would be smirking, handsome and hard to resist. A real lady killer.|`|AA11564934	wow, what a total waste of time.    Murder is so subjective as to be meaningless.  It's an illusion.|`|9kdUmttPaa	Are you actually asking this question? Quite frankly, I don't want to understand those kinds of things.|`|OqlXBUsaaa	since murder is universally accepted as bad, wrong and evil,   he should be a man of despising character and odorous smell. his looks would be scary like the devil and sounds annoying to destroy the ears|`|BA3y6MBlaa	Murder is (ok I'll go with the male theme), is dark and ugly and evil and doomed to the rest of his life dealing with the family of the dead person and dealing with the afterlife.

Fmw26a4yaa	What they do to make South Park (you should watch the christmas special with mr hanky in season four to get a better way to know this) is make the characters on photoshop or really cut out different pieces with no mouth and no eyes, make backgrounds, put the characters on them, add limbs to move around with and take pictures. Yes it is stop motion, i know 100%. Then they put mouths on with different shapes to make them talk. If you have windows upload the pics and choose how long you want them to be according to the sound that you later record    With the sound download a recording program or something    For mac do the same but upload the pics onto iMovie.    Mac sure you cantact me when you make it!!!  I wanna see it.|`|OR5PhU40aa	Design the characters in Adobe Photoshop, animate them using PowerAnimator (for special effects) and Maya (which is normally used for 3D animation, but Matt and Trey use these programs to animate the show).    This may seem expensive, but if you want a high-quality animation, this is what to aim for. You could also use flash, although it would take a great deal more time than it should with such simple animation.    I suggest Photoshop or OpenCanvas, personally; it's the closest you'll get to creating a tone similar to that in the show.|`|bLGvLY7caa	You can do a pretty decent job with Anime Studio. There is also a version called Anime Studio PRO which has lip syncing software and really makes work much faster. Doing South Park style animation is a snap with either one.    I use Anime Studio Pro professionally and it's super easy to work with.     Anime Studio works just like Anime Studio PRO. If you'd like to see it in action, you can check out some of the tutorials I have on my site for it: http://www.markbremmer.com/3Bpages/anime...     Additionally, it's only $50 bucks - waaaaay cheaper than doing the Maya route. I've got links over to it on my site.
rVhrVyRGaa	http://www.banneroftruth.org/pages/news/...     Harvie M. Conn, 1933-1999    Harvie M. Conn, the professor of missions, emeritus, at Westminster Theological Seminary, Philadelphia, and author of several books on global missions, passed away on August 28, 1999 in Wyndmoor, PA after a long battle with cancer. He was born in Regina, Saskatchewan in 1933 and became an American citizen in 1957. Dr Conn received an A.B. from Calvin College in 1954. He earned a B.D. in 1957 and a Th.M. in 1958 from Westminster Theological Seminary and was awarded a Litt.D. from Geneva College in 1976.     Beginning in 1957 he was a church planter in New Jersey and later served as a missionary in Korea, where he had an itinerant ministry of preaching in churches in the countryside and city. He also taught New Testament for ten years at the General Assembly Theological Seminary in Seoul and carried on a ministry of evangelism among prostitutes and pimps, receiving a few beatings for his troubles.     When he came to Westminster in 1972, he taught both apologetics and missions. An expert in interpreting popular culture through comment on films, he applied Cornelius Van Til's apologetic in new ways. He took Westminster students on field trips to India and Uganda. One outcome of his interdisciplinary teaching was a new approach to urban evangelism and missions, leading to one of Westminster's recent emphases - urban missions programmes at all degree levels. From 1989-1999 Conn was editor of "Urban Mission," a journal for urban ministry practitioners begun by former Westminster professor Roger Greenway in 1983.     As a result of requests from urban pastors in Philadelphia, the Westminster Ministerial Institute was begun in 1973 under Conn's direction. Saturday classes at Westminster later led to the formation of the Center for Urban Theological Studies in the Hunting Park section of Philadelphia.     Harvie Conn also wrote and edited a number of books on preaching, evangelism and missions.     My personal contacts with him were not strong. He was the editor of a festchrift in honouring Edmund P. Clowney and I must have been the very last contributor to send in my essay. He was patient and helpful but did not possess the same view of the ministry as myself. I felt he was a man whose sympathies were more with the anabaptists and men like Ronald Sider than any Presbyterian I knew in the USA. That was good for me as it indicated that radicalism had nothing to do with the subjects of baptism or any form of church government.

I think G K Chesterton said something along the lines of "Wrong is wrong even if everyone does it and right is right even if no one does it."    My thinking is whether we believe something or not doesn't have any relevance to the factual truth of it, beyond some small placebo effect.     Along your idea, from a psychological view we do try to justify our opinions and beliefs.  That can be shown in when research conducts "double blind" studies.  It shields the researchers from influencing the experiment based on their bias.|`|BA3y6MBlaa	Your question was hard to follow.  I'm sure it's my fault, ok.....oh those that believe and those that don't I'd buy that ticket to watch the show after death.  Would be facinating.

If you are still here...and this to me is the most brutal definition of heaven or hell I could think of.  My belief is that we judge ourselves.  That girl you should've asked to dance, that person who dropped their belongings.  That begger who made you lose sleep, When you told your sister she was stupid, or maybe joined the group to be mean to a good kid with bad luck...you know what you did...you will be your own judge.  Brutal huh?    Prejiduce, closed hearts, not letting people in, being a good son or daughter, and honest person, ethical person, apologized when it had meaning, hard worker, rolling over when your partner is crying, laughing at ugly jokes - ok their funny but they are hurtful, Never saying thank you for your gifts, your birth in a prosperous country (magine those pictures of bloated black babies with flies, lucky deserves a big bow of thanks)  etc., your education (remember some people spend all day retrieving water and figuring out where to get thier tasty rice only dinner then sleep on a dirt floor with a box for a blanket...oh yeah their parents died of aids....)  Too much?  OK...I have that tendency.    But be your own judge of good and bad, maybe you are your God judge.  And if you do believe it all ends at death, then that's all the more reason to make your life meaningful and memorable.    Whatever!

5L6z92Iqaa	Heck yes she is over reacting! I never even heard it had leaked until it was posted on her site and im sure alot of other people hadn't either... and if they had were they smart enough to find it hidden online?    I hope that she realizes that she is making millions of people disgruntled too because regardless of what one person did the rest of the world shoulnd't be punished and she shouldn't have to hide away her talent.    I know you said that her true fans wouldn't be interested in half the work and i think that is partly true. I, for one, have actually read the partial draft and it makes me drool all the more for her to finish it. The draft is much better from Edwards perspective and he should be able to tell his story just like she should be able to finish it.     I secretly think she will finish it and then BAM! it gets published and sells trillions.    Note to ZZ: it wasn't stolen, the copy that was lent out was actually given to the person by Stephenie herself in good faith that it wouldn't be leaked. (All the more reason to be pissed but oh well.)|`|HZubplhvaa	It's an author thing.  I don't think she's overreacting, though I'd love her to finish it.

While I'm not a fan of her nor her work, I don't think she should allow someone's actions to dictate whether or not she should continue doing something I assume she loves.    Throwing a tantrum isn't going to fix anything.    Consider it a first-draft and a rare opportunity to gauge reader's reactions and start over. The plot doesn't have to be exactly the same and if she's unable to come up with new ideas then she wasn't that great of a writer to begin with.|`|AgWPdIKMaa	Are you kidding me?  Of course she is!

It's a terrible thing to happen at any time to anyone. She's not overreacting about what am awful thing it is. But she is acting like a spoiled child. It was only the first draft that got out and as any writer knows the first draft is very different from the final piece. I don't know if she's trying to "get back" at the person who leaked it or what, but it's not effecting them at all - it's only herself and the fans who are getting hurt by this. If she's decided she just doesn't want to finish it because she doesn't like the idea anymore or whatever fine. I understand that, it happens to all of us writers. But she needs to come out and say that, not keep going "oh it leaked, poor poor me, I won't work on it anymore." If she wants to write it she needs to just get on with it and, again, stop going "oh it leaked, poor poor me, I won't work on it anymore."|`|9pdYGJdQaa	She is far from over reacting that is her story to share not someone else besides I belive she's continuing again so get over it if she doesn't want to write it who are you to say sh needs to publish is

LVZdzPmpaa	I think it is important to remember that there is a reason why your teacher asks you to read specific works. "The Pearl," for example, is a little classic and is an important work, not only of Steinbeck's, but of that literary era.    Like KK above, I, too, loved it and remember it fondly.    Today, with rubbish like "Twilight" at the forefront of teen reading, real books like "The Pearl" are dismissed. That is unfortunate. "The Pearl" will endure; in four or five years, "Twilight" will disappear even from the remainder bins.    My Little Happily Ever After (above) clearly has no clue and is in no position to review or critique Steinbeck or anyone else. The comments are the product of someone who is not well read.    Frankly, the "i hated it ugh!" comments are the result of immaturity. There's no other excuse for them.    Do yourself a favor, especially since you enjoy reading: read "The Pearl."  Go slow if you must. Read it aloud if you like. That sometimes help you get the rhythm of it. But whatever you do, read it front to back. Have some faith that it has great value; otherwise, your teacher wouldn't bother to offer it to you.     I can guarantee that at some point, you'll be glad you read it.|`|lTgGowpOaa	the one about the indians with the small baby and they thought the pearl he found would lead to riches, but it only led to hurt? tht one  hemingway i think?|`|ye6IiFr7aa	ugh i hated it.

ANYTHING is better than this...|`|YorMkZYAaa	To you teenagers anyone over 25 is considered old so I'm curious as to approximate age of your teacher.    John Steinbeck's "The Pearl" is a wonderful book that I enjoyed when I was in middle school (about 15 years ago I might add). I wish I could give a decent summary now but it's been so long I simply don't remember it.    Read it with an open mind and don't look to dislike it because it may be considered "old' (and that includes your teacher).    EDIT:    I have a stalker now. Woohoo! Oh yes, bring on the thumbs down you jerk. Jeebus. I said nothing to warrant it in the first place. Calm down people.|`|nPaUPRRTaa	I had to read it  at the beginning of the school year and i had to force myself through it. It was very boring to me and i hate the way that it ended.|`|qlgti3wKaa	I really disliked it. It was boring and unrealistic, and the theme was oddly demonstrated. The characters were strangely developed, too. Overall, it really isn't that great of a book.
mhrrwST6aa	A suggestion for you hair...something simple if your hair is long enough, but pigtails.  Make them handle bar style and messed up. Also I don't know if you have glasses or not, but if you don't wear glasses just find an old pair and pop out the lenses and wear them either pushed up really far up your nose or really low.  Also, an ugly sweater/sweater vest would be great.  Hope it helped.
prW1i0vzaa	I would wear a dress, but don't make it TOO dressy. Don't switch from dance to prom! Make it simple. :)|`|PyW5xHU0aa	Of course.  Wear somthing normal and basic, i bet your date will love you|`|2GNhufQ0aa	i guess. what else could you wear to a dance? jeans?|`|N2pZ6XDnaa	Y WOULD U WEAR A DRESS IN DA WINTER|`|sequZxauaa	a white dress|`|vdmAOQ3Paa	It's a wonderland dance. HELL YEAH!!! a white one with like light blue accent or subtle glitter would be cute but not too dressy|`|AvA2972uaa	they usually are formal my suggestion would be is go with the theme of the dance and wear a blue dress with the sparkly stuff on it|`|ZrB5xJUSaa	You should light colours example... blue=baby blue....Pink=creamy pink. A good tip don't clase with your friend who is a guy!  good luck hope I helped!|`|KcvinDvgaa	Wear it if you love it and it looks great on you :)  You can be that gorgeous girl everyone looks at and goes   "wow i wish i wore a dress" xP|`|ijSjRY1Taa	yes dress - congrats on the date!|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	Yes.|`|NXlsRNkHaa	Yea usually at dances you where dresses. Ask your friends to see what they are wearing.|`|6mXZKX7maa	sure or a really cute outfit like a really Pretty skirt with a matching shirt|`|47BmzHbKaa	well..it depends on how conservative it is or how it looks, you should show a picture.|`|9D3i9s5eaa	find out if it's formal...|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	It sounds like it is|`|gX7KThhoaa	yea not too fancy butt good enough to paass for the dance
8asG4WCwaa	Returns - that is a normal part of many businesses, not just books.  Even Walmart can return product  to a vendor if it isn't selling.  There's nothing weird in this practice. Real publishers do this (and if they can't resell the books, or remainder them to a wholesale outlet, then they strip and pulp them).     For book stores, this is one of many issues with self publishers because they refuse to accept this policy (which just points out that they are a printing service for authors, not a traditional publisher).  Those self publishers that supposedly "do accept returns", have such rediculous limitations on it, many book stores still won't carry their books.    If you check sales figures with self publishers, they will inflate them to look legitimate (one is even claiming a best seller as theirs, when in fact, that is not the version of the book they once printed).  Most self published autors never sell more than 50 books.  They won't tell you that, of course.    The few self published successes they keep advertising amount to less than 1%, and would have been a bigger sucess if it had been traditionally published.  Most of these are nonfiction books, by the way, which had marketing potential to start with, and a network of buyers.    Bookwire keeps a lot of sales data on the industry.  You should really check out the Writer Beware blogs to get a good understanding of the industry and why self publishing is not well thought of.|`|0j18Wq6faa	Why not go to a publisher and ask? Maybe send an email to a book store that sells books.

41dd813bfd40242dc615727b2a55488eaa	A producer/director I know, once told me that if he had it to do all over again, he would get a job sweeping the floors of a soundstage, rather than spend the time and money he wasted going to film school.    I think about that every time I meet another kid going to a 65 thousand dollar a year film school.  I think about that, and realize that this nice kid is throwing his money away... but worse yet... he's taking on a HUGE student loan, attending a film school that will in reality do very little for him in the long run.  I think about that, and realize that there is no kind way to explain to him that he's wasting his time... so I keep my mouth shut.    You want to be an actor?  Go out and act.  Find a good class to attend, and go out and act.  The class will keep you working on your craft, while you look for your next opportunity to go out and act.    You want to be a director? Go get a job running the Craft Services table for a film studio... you'll meet lots of people who can help you become a P.A.   and with enough experience, you can become an A.D.   You'll be an assistant director, about the same time that the kid that just entered film school gets a job working the craft services table.
AgWPdIKMaa	I love him too!  Just remember that he's not real.  If you know that, then you're fine.  But I know; it's nice to wish there was a guy like Edward out there|`|PAUB1Sm3aa	Yes, it's weird. Why are you in love with a fictional character who is a) dead b) likely more than 9 decades older than you c) watches you while you sleep d) would disconnect/break your car so you couldn't drive to a friend's house e) a sexist pig who thinks women are weaklings f) a stalker g) would like to snap your neck and eat you h) must I go on?|`|rh2toYSZaa	I think most people like/love Edward Cullen due to the way he acts towards Bella. We all want someone like him... and it's okay to be obsessed. It's not weird either. I love him as well.|`|r6vbAM1Eaa	well no, because i have been in love with book characters before, but just know that he isn't real.  ~annie b ?|`|nprzHREiaa	well  as long as you remember that he's not real he will never be real and that there's not a chance in the world that he will be real.    and yeah you are obsessed. but don't worry after you've seen the 100,000,000,000th twilight question you'll probably won't be obsessed anymore. trust me i'm there.|`|ArUtCrGlaa	yes..... my father is use to it by now.|`|TlqSAM0naa	no, cuz every girl needs an edward    i'm obssessed too, as are thousands of other teenage girls =]|`|bun3Nq3kaa	as long as you don't really believe that you can have him cause he doesn't exist. but yea it's okay.|`|1nC4fVw3aa	your friends are right|`|JnSrN3guaa	ilove edward too, but just as long as you know that you're in love with a fictional character, it's okay. if you're one of those girls that "wants to have kids with edward" then yes, you are ooberly obsessed, because that is physically impossible, and very literally phsyco... it's okay to love him, just as long as you know edward's fictional limits. [:    :D|`|15a091aaac1a8ad452d92f5a93d4c2deaa	I don't think it is weird, but I do think it is unrealistic.  Edward is a fantasy.  He was imagined and built by a fiction writer purposefully, with calculation and cleverness, to be very attractive to females, especially the young (teen, pre-teen) romantic heart (which is still alive in older females too!).  Problem is, though those desires for a man like that are honest and deeply felt, finding a man like that is a bit unlikely.  Don't believe me? Talk to older women.  So, bottom line, if your expectations for the love of your life are that high, you are bound to  be disappointed. And that disappointment can lead to a lot of problems.|`|XWvsbK8saa	i cant even answer,    my teachers have to remind me that he isnt real...|`|rNSM38Jaaa	I guess its okay, but you have to remember that he isn't real. I fall in love with characters in my boks also. But its not bad to be obsessed.|`|892c68b3fbf16fcc237d4213d6ad7c4caa	Its okay.   My friends think that too.   haha (:|`|NEJeAx3Uaa	Its cool to have a book you have enjoyed reading,but you should know he is just a fictional character..|`|Sv99BNlEaa	it's ok to love the book.  its not ok to fall in love with imaginary beings xD  as long as you know and understand edward isnt real and will never be, then your fine. plenty of people love the series, just make sure your not, say, waiting for edward to come knock on your door  =]|`|SCQphK96aa	im in love with him too :( it makes me sad i'll never have a sexy agressive vampire|`|7xwAxMvKaa	Hell no! Most of the girls in my school are in love with him!
JhvqUvlsaa	No, I have not noticed that until now. What a wonderful observation!   We cannot have one without the other; this would defeat the purpose of the cycle of life. They are opposite, yet they are pairs. To fully appreciate one, you have to be able to see another and experience another.    Amazing how two opposites can come together to form the structure of our lives!|`|FoIxsunVaa	My world revolves around threes!    yes - no - maybe  night - day -twilight  black - white -gray  hot - cold -lukewarm  happiness - sadness - neutrality  rich - poor -middle class  live - die - vegetate  love - hate - indifference  open - closed -ajar|`|Po4Lljjwaa	Wow!

(i.e yes no maybe)|`|AA11488628	there are two basic choices. inaction or action. from that stems the rest of the choices we make. the number two is just a number like all the rest.   ex.   the choices really are  yes-no-maybe  night-daybreak-sunrise-day-afternoon-e...  black-white-gray-rainbow of color  hot-warm-cold  there are more emotions than that  rich-middle class- poor and all the things between  live-half-life-die  love-apathy-like-hate  open-sort of closed-and closed.   the world is not black and white we all live in the gray.|`|1adVJEuWaa	Yes, I've noticed that TOO.

7X82RNuiaa	I am majoring in art, and while I just started, I can tell you it is a little different from what I thought it would be. Unless you are going to an art school, you can only have concentrations in art, which means you have to learn all forms of art, and then focus in on the one that you like best as you are about to graduate. Art is known to be a pretty difficult major, mostly because of the amount of time that you spend outside of class (6 hrs a week per class). You obviously need all of your core classes, but it is recommended that you mix them in with art classes so you don't have overdo yourself with all of the projects and outside classwork. You have to take a number of art history classes, and you begin studio art in a drawing class. At my university we also have to take a 2-d and 3-d design class, which use adobe photoshop and illustrator. Then as you move out of the basics, you have to take classes in different mediums, such as printmaking, photography, ceramics, jewelry making, etc. After that you move on to specific classes according to your major. Overall you will take around 130hrs of classes to graduate, depending on where you are going.|`|zBpj9jCfaa	No way! Majoring in art is so much fun!  It's probably different at each school, but at my school, you start out taking basic drawing, design and 3D classes, then you move on into classes for your major (mine is graphic design, too). But I am also required to take some other basic studio classes, like ceramics, painting, etc. just so everyone can get a broad education in many different fields. And then of course you have to take some art history classes as well.    It really is fun. Most of my art classes are studio classes, which means they are 2 hours and 40 minutes long, but it gives you plenty of time to work. And the best part is, when finals roll around and everyone else is stressing about their big cumulative exams, you're pretty much done with everything! It's great!     If you love art, it isn't hard at all. It's actually very rewarding.|`|sosisPXbaa	fine arts isnt hard (inspiration-wise maybe, but not execution-wise).  however commercial art often is.  (that includes graphic design)    the reason is because in fine arts its about interpretation so your instructors are less likely to tell you are wrong, simply because the work is so personal.  in commercial art, the work has to look completely professional and must strictly adhere to what the professor or client wants.    fine arts undergrad/ 3d modeling grad
dKrLAJaEaa	When someone comes into the area where you are playing and searches for the CD player to see who is playing.|`|ji7WZvC1aa	I played an intermediate instrument until I'd been playing for about 6 1/2 years, when I got a Buffet R-13.  I was 14 at that point, and knew that I'd want to keep playing through university, although I didn't plan on it as a career.  I was very glad to have a professional instrument when at 17 I got a call from the city's symphony orchestra asking me to play in a few concerts.  I don't play much these days, but I still have my R-13 (it's been with me more than half my life now!) and I like to know it's there.|`|gM03eKTJaa	You and/or your teacher will know when to upgrade. When it feels the instrument isn't pulling its weight or feels dead, that's when you need to switch. Unless you're going to play at least half-seriously after school, you probably won't need to upgrade - your intermediate instrument will be enough. Don't fall under the impression that a better instrument will instantly make you play better.|`|UwiGwDGdaa	It depends on the demands of your performance. Are you wanting to improve the sound? Have better key action? Change the weight of the clarinet?     While I am a bass clarinet player, during my first year of college studying performance I upgraded my neckpiece and mouthpiece to change the tone quality which greatly worked while I saved money for a pro horn. You could try upgrading your barrel, mouthpiece, and bell to quality grenadilla replacements.     Honestly, it's up to you. When you feel like you'll be better served by a professional horn, then make the trade. People switch depending upon their performance demands or their own desires. Try trading out your mouthpiece and bell first - that can be a good substitute while you save money for a pro model.     Don't let the actions of others dictate your own - musicians constantly switch around on instrument brands until they find one that "feels right." It's a very costly investment - so think before you buy.

C77c0OE2aa	Combining two or more photos into a single photo is actually very simple. Imagine having actual prints of your photos and say they are 8 inches width x 10 inches height in size. Then imagine laying out a piece of paper large enough to hold each print. If you wanted to place the photos side by side, you would need a sheet of paper that would be twice as wide as your prints, so you would need a sheet 16 inches wide by 10 inches high. If you wanted to place the photos on top of each other, you would need a sheet of paper twice as high as your photos, so that would be a piece of paper 20 inches high and 8 inches wide.    You will do the same thing in the computer. In Photoshop or GIMP http://www.gimp.org you will go to FILE - NEW and enter the dimensions of you new "canvas size". You can either do this in inches or pixels or any other unit of measure. There is a drop down list beside the size boxes where you can select units of measure. Again, you will create a new canvas that is large enough to contain your photos you want to place into it. You will need to know the exact size of your photos. You can go to IMAGE - SIZE and see the dimensions of your photos and then from those numbers you will know how large to make your new canvas.    Be SURE, however, when you are creating your new canvas, that you set the resolution (DPI) to the same number as your original photos, otherwise there will be a huge size difference between your new canvas and the photos you drop into it.    You can also make the new canvas larger than your photos if you want to add borders or a different color background or text or design embellishment. Only your skill and imagination are the limiting factors as to what you can do.    steve

C77c0OE2aa	Yes, you can go into LEVELS or CURVES in Photoshop and bring up the midtone brightness to where the faces can probably be seen...    BUT    ... there is a trade-off. Photos still need to be right in the camera in the first place. Trying to force a good photo with these methods in the computer will result in some very ugly digital "noise"... ugly specks of red, green, and blue... as well as no contrast and washed out color.     So yeah, it can be made light, but it cannot be made to look good.    steve|`|uJBnZWtcaa	The newer versions of Photoshop and Photoshop Elements will let you open a jpg in the RAW processor. It's always important to tell us answerers what program you're using.    Let's pretend you have Photoshop.  There are all kinds of sliders in ACR (Adobe Camera Raw) that will let you easily give the photo more exposure, lower the blacks, and provide Fill Lighting.  Open PS, File>Open As, find your photo and click to highlight.  There's a box at the bottom of the Open As dialog that says "Open As", click the drop down and select RAW.  Your photo will open in a new workspace.  In the White Balance dropdown click on Custom and start sliding the sliders.    When you finish, hold down the ALT key and click on the button on the bottom, far right that says "Open Copy".  Your photo will appear in the normal workspace and you can Save As or crop, etc.|`|oq6ofi72aa	You can try to make the photo lighter in almost any program, but the quality will decrease the more you try to fix it.  You lose a lot of details in the dark areas, and when you lighten them you a lot, the picture becomes noisy/grainy and the details become even harder to pick out.

AA11142708	The form of teaching that has become known as the Socratic Method originated in Plato's dialogues. "Dialogue" is essential to the method because the method entails asking leading questions that, in the end, requires that the person answering those questions ends up contradicting himself/herself with their own answers--dialogue is the only way to teach this method of argument.     The Socratic method is the best way (perhaps the only legitimate way) to educate values, morality, ethics, and religion. Socrates, in my opinion, penetrated to the heart of what it means to become a better informed and compassionate human being. Thanks for the question.|`|FoIxsunVaa	E.

efY2tqNbaa	Well, if you want to know a big one that lasted up until World War Two...  Oliver Cromwell and the New Model Army in England after the English Civil war. After his dictatorship and killing of those that were not puritans, especially the Scots and Irish, England was reluctant to have a national standing army, something that they passed onto us. We never had a large one until after the second World War.    Also, continuing with Puritans. They believe in the Elect, or those that were pre-ordained to go to Heaven. They believed that the people that worked hard and were the most successful were being rewarded because they were elect. That is evident in American society today, as they, for the most part, look up to those that have more and want to be like them. Thanks to the Puritans, in a way, we also have our absolute differences, as they had no middle ground.    Hope it helps. :)|`|nB9DY5tdaa	The Wheel|`|VGlGtWvIaa	don know
WMJwIRGxaa	Time has been measured by the single greatest event in the history of mankind, the birth & life of Jesus Christ.    The original designation for the time before Christ was born is BC (Before Christ).  The designation for time, beginning from the birth of Christ was AD (Anno Domini), or "year of our Lord".    In recent years, a concerted effort of the secularists has been to remove all reference of Christ & Christianity.

iT9S20zvaa	You might also want to consider the kind of message this series would send your daughter.  Stephenie Meyer's characters are very superficial.  During the entire first book, the main character lusts over the other main character (and that's basically all it's about).    I would honestly tell you that this series is extremely inappropriate for an 11-year-old.  I wouldn't let my sisters read it because 1) it is very shallow (love is based on looks), 2) the characters have no personalities, 3) the main male character is almost abusive and he is a stalker, 4) the main female character does nothing for herself and is extremely dependent (she becomes suicidal when the main male character is away).    Also, if you read above (those comments about events later in the series are true), the things that happen are not good for a young girl.    There is kind of an obsessive/lustful tone throughout the whole series.  I don't think this would teach a young girl anything worthwhile or good. I hope you won't allow her to read it.  The series has no substance whatsoever.|`|JnSrN3guaa	well, in the thrid book, the main character doesn't want to become a vampire, until she loses one human experience that she doesn't want to give up for immortality, so that gives you a preview of what will happen in the last book. and in the last book, they go on their honeymoon, and the main character (girl) tells of how she feels before the sex, and after, but that's all. when they are "making love" it does not say anything about it during. [: it's 0KAY for them, ithink, but if you feel like it's not, don't let her read it until she's old enough, and if you've already had the "sex talk" with her, and that would be more appropriate, as well. =]]    :D|`|bun3Nq3kaa	twilight and new moon are okay. but eclipse and breaking dawn are for a little older crowds but stephenie meyer doesn't go into detail about sex at all. Other than that twilight is good and an easy read.|`|1nC4fVw3aa	you can let her read the 1st 2 books because there's nothing bad going on but for the last 2 i would wait till shes a little older|`|qjutViNuaa	Well twilight and new moon are fine.  In Eclipse ( i think) Charley (her dad) tries to have the sex talk with her.  In  eclipse they also in on scene that they meantion it and they talk about how Eedward wants to wait till they are married until they have sex. In breaking Dawn she sets you up for it . They go skinny dipping at night and she cuts it off until that morning when she wakes up covered in feathers.  I would say it is fine for her to read the first to but the third and the forth i would say can wait.|`|TffCSzHxaa	The Twilight series is probably alright for an 11 year old. But in Twilight there is a very graphic, violent part, it might scare her. And in New Moon, Bella gets...depressed. Plus parts of it are really sad. In Eclipse, nothing is that bad, but there is a lot of kissing, and one scene were Bella and Edward are in a bed...together. And they discuss what they will do after marriage. And finally Breaking Dawn. Yeah...um, it might be a bit mature for her. Because Bella does get pregnant. And you can't get pregnant without *doing things*. So you might want to give her *the talk* before letting her read the fourth book. But over all, I think Twilight is a great book! It's well written, it has a great story line, and all the characters are so lovable! I can't get enough of it! But just in case, you might want to read it. You'd probably turn into a "Twimom" or a "Fanpire" after reading it!|`|2QTktDQsaa	Twilight is not a good book for your daughter. Apart from the fact the books aren't even good:    Starting from New Moon, the way Bella acts is not good for any young girl to read, because when the first book is done, a lot of my friends love Bella. She practically kills herself because her boyfriend left her. It teaches that women can't support themselves.    And then the following 2 books goes on, and then the relationship between Edward & Bella gets abusive.    In Braking Dawn, when they do have sex, she wakes up with bruises, and she completely fine with it, practically happy about it.    The baby is eating her from the inside out, and when she has the baby, it's a pretty gruesome part... She's like spewing blood from her womb while there's a killer baby coming out, Edward is biting her neck and trying to rip open the womb by also biting it, and a fight goes on with Rosalie.    It's a complete disaster.    Something that is kind of disturbing to me (I dunno about other people) is the relationship between Jacob & Renesmee. She's like, 6 or something like that, and he's between 16 & 17. He falls in love with her. o.o I find that just weird.    She's 18, having sex, gets pregnant, and gets married a such a young age? Let her wait until she is like 14 or 15 to start reading the books.    I suggest, if she hasn't already, read Harry Potter (best books ever, might I add  :])|`|AgWPdIKMaa	I've read it.  I'm 14 but pretty mature for my age, or so grown-ups tell me.  Don't let her read it!  She probably won't understand a lot of it anyway..  and too much sex in it!  You should read the Twilight Saga first|`|SBhVZD4Xaa	not only are there implications of sex, eddie eats mary sue's uterus!|`|9pdYGJdQaa	She already sees it on tv and it makes some suggestions of sex but she doesn't go into detail|`|SCQphK96aa	the first book is ok for her to read, problem is if you let her read she'll bug you to get the other three which i highly recommend for girls at the age of 15 and older, there are moments when they start to get intimate and there are also descriptive violent scenes about vampires ripping heads off eachother|`|XWvsbK8saa	wow  its not innapropreate, it isnt graphic.  ive read them all 2 times.      im not trying to be offensive and please dont take this the wrong way, but your a lil too over protective.|`|rNSM38Jaaa	Yes, in the 3rd and last book it talks about sex. Not going into extreme detail, but I would wait on the last book for your daughter, she talks about birth and the girl gets pregnant. I would think the first 2 books would be alright. If you prefer, wait another year, my friend read them and shes only 11 too.|`|mRr9TU7Kaa	You can most defiantly let her read Twilight, I was her age when I read it. New Moon is also fine and Eclipse is slightly inappropriate but not much. In Breaking Dawn they have sex and Bella gets pregnant but the only thing described in that area is the birth seen which is bloody because it is not a normal pregnancy. I say let her read Twilight, New Moon and Eclipse but read Breaking Dawn before her.|`|892c68b3fbf16fcc237d4213d6ad7c4caa	Twilight and New Moon are fine for her to read.   Eclipse has one scene that might be too old for her,   and Breaking Dawn has a lot of scenes that imply sex.   None of them are really graphic though.   Some things in the books she might not understand also.   I think she should probably wait a while to read them,   since once she starts the first two, she won't want to stop   reading them.   (: good luckkk.|`|2HmPJT0kaa	In the last book, Breaking Dawn, sex is definitely implied. Also, the theme of "teen pregnancy" is greatly glorified.    In my opinion, do not let your daughter read the Twilight series. In fact, there are many great pieces of literature out there--if you wanted bad fan fiction (Twilight), then fanfiction.net is the place. Why not find a series that promotes positive themes?    You can probably ask your local library for opinions on well-written literature... if they even mention Twilight, leave immediately.    Good luck!    Eos|`|W8F9PboZaa	It depends on her maturity.   In the book there is no sex scenes shown. But it's highly implied. The next day Bella, the lead female, has been beaten black and blue because Edward, the lead male, cannot control his strength. I was disturbed when I read it at 17. But for some reason younger kids seem to see right through it and see Edward's regret as romantic.    Then she gets pregnant off their violent sex, the baby starts eating her alive and Edward does a c-section with his teeth. It disgusts me. But again younger kids think it's cute and romantic.    Yeah definitely read it before hand. The first couple are ok, but if she's like every other girl at that age she won't want to stop. She'll just get angry at you for denying it. If I were you I'd definitely read it first|`|0dc236d8b840bb8b7d2aed819c8a01c6aa	Twilight is ok to read and yes there are implications of sex in Breaking Dawn so i wouldn't tell you to let her read that just yet along with Eclipse. New Moon is ok too. The situations in the book are a little too mature for an 11 year old.    Happy reading:)|`|nOLVHNaBaa	Never read it or anything but all I know is that it's popular...if that helps at all...so just read it yourself like you said and then think about it, at my school (high school) I hear it all the time kind of.|`|a929a02c3d0e7291f8fa143144122d89aa	The first two books Twilight and New Moon are okay but Eclipse and Breaking Dawn are not that okay.

HAH!   welll i dont know,, but my ten year old brother was reading them,, but he stopped cuz he thought it was boring,  im 14, and i  just strating to read the first one,, and its not innapropriate so farr,,|`|lHFWke4Baa	In Twilight theres just kissing. And the main guy character is gone in New Moon so nothing there. In Eclipse theres kissing and the girl character asks the guy to have sex with her. He doesnt do it with her, and it doesnt go into detail. In Breaking dawn they do have sex and she ends up gettng pregnant. But it doesnt tell detail it just says like they made love together, but it doesnt tell the details. But there good books. And there fine for a 11 year old. Go to stepheniemeyer.com or hisgoldeneyes.com or even go to watch-movies.net and you can watch the full movie for free! The other two sites tell you some information about the books.|`|dZyoGbUdaa	You should definitely read them before you allow her and decide for yourself if they are appropriate.  There is sex and a birth scene in one of the books.  But more disturbing is the emotionally abusive and demeaning relationship between Edward and Bella depicted in all of the books.

dlaqQE6Xaa	.    This is a very big topic.    Look into the fact that the so called "big Vikings" were actually very tiny people.    They were actually not warriors and were actually tradesmen.  Most of the so called "Viking Settlements" were trade stations that were frequented seasonally.    Mose "Vikings" were not from Sweden and most seem to have been from Germany and Norway and Denmark.    The entire "Baltic Sea" and "North Sea" area was "Viking District".    So, sorry for not being able to differentiate.....  Most "Vikings" were not the ones trading in Sweden.    You have to remember at the time you referring to that the "boundaries" for the Scandinavian Nations were very vague and flexible.  The country of Sweden has not existed for very many hundred years.    Parts of what were "Sweden", that is "Svithjud" were larger in what is not the Baltic East and Russia.  Only a small part was in Sweden.    You see the difficulty in answering your question as asked?    Good Luck With your essay.  Perhaps you should change the main thread of the essay....    JohnW

Also, some of the lines are about the guitar by itself, some are about you by yourself, and some are about you and the guitar. The whole thing should be about you and the guitar. The other answer was right though, this isn't technically a sonnet. Here's some alternative wordings to give you some ideas:    Red like a lipstick. ("like lipstick" or "like my lipstick")    Placed on my hands is always a pick ("My hand is on the pick" or "From my hand with the pick")    The body is a hard rock, ("is hard rock" would act as a metaphor)    Shaped like a pepsi bottle. ("in a pepsi bottle shape")    Only used to play rock, (ambiguous, "I only used to play rock" or "It's only used to play rock" ?)    I jam with my friends, ("It jams with my friends" would be cool personification)    Until my fingers have blisters. ("until my fingers are blistered")    I don't care if its only on the weekends, (too long, "weekends are enough")    But i love to sing them tongue twisters.

76e62e65b5d36e5702624ed6fce05eebaa	It's not much harder than any other instrument. My husband teaches guitar, and when I tried, I found a few things:    Find someone to teach you how to hold it properly, get a few lessons from a professional guitar player, and check in every year. Playing an instrument incorrectly can damage your body.    There are a lot of great music books available for all styles, levels and ages. The Alfred Series for Adults is really good, but try a few different ones to find the style you like.    And like all instruments, (and - well - anything in life), it takes consistent practice - daily is best, even it if it's 10-30 minutes to relax after your day.|`|7t4A5BRDaa	I taught myself guitar, and learned pretty quickly. I picked it up fast. Just look up some guitar videos on Youtube, and they will help you. You don't need to pay for lessons.|`|AM33tqYAaa	i learned how to read sheet music, i learned chords, tab, scales, and stuff like that    just do whatever suites your style|`|AA11442722	Depends on the style of music you want to play and you. If your going to play Rock or Blues or other inprovisional styles of music I'd advise you to avoid lessons. I've played in tons of bands and folks who had lessons are almost non-existant in bands. I might have met one or two who had any lessons and those were usually in HS or College. If you intend to play Classical guitar lessons are almost a must. Jazz is another genre where lessons would help because of Jazz's extremely heavy use of scales and theory.     As for how hard it is. Depends more on motivation than anything else. Anybody can learn how to play guitar if they want too. The hardest part is building up the hand strength, callouses and muscle memory for chording. After that it gets exponentially easy until you reach a platau. Then it'll seem like no matter howmuch you play you don'g get better. Then you break through and learn rapidly until the next plautue.     My advice, get a decent guitar. Bug every guitar player you know for every tip and commit to at least an hour every day until you get pretty solid on guitar.|`|VfIwoInNaa	go get a guitar and a professional teacher.

Look at a map.|`|94bc2dec827aab848ba69cb5895f7ba6aa	The Erie Canal helped in the development of the Midwest, as suddenly cities like Buffalo, Chicago, or Detroit became ocean ports.  In other words, shipping could now travel directly from the Great Lakes (east of Lake Ontario) to the ocean.    Anything that increases the importance of one part of the US would negatively impact the South, as that would decrease the importance of the South.

Dj5f1SRfaa	You can probably find that on Sparknotes, but I would suggest actually reading the play, its really very good.    Antigone is the classic story of good vs. good.  Antigone defied her father, the King,  by burying her brother even though the King proclaimed anyone who did so would be executed because the brother committed treason.  She does it anyway and the King sentences her to death for disobeying his command.      She is right because she acted from the heart  He is right because he acted for the good of the kingdom
sRw9oiQdaa	Improv is an excellent way to develop acting skills and confidence.  As well, Improv will help with public speaking and could help in debate.  As to educational applications, I think that if you also included  'serious' improvisation you would be making sure that you are not just being goofy.  I was a High School Drama teacher for several years in Alberta, Canada and improv is actually a unit in the high school drama curriculum.|`|jPcRG4V7aa	i would so join that if my school had one!

aILzgoK9aa	Imperialism is the extension of control of one government or nation over another. The United States became an imperialist nation to expand their markets overseas and bring in more profit for the nation and we became an imperialist nation to prove to the world that we were not weak. Because, during that time we were reconstructing from a civil war and the other countries thought that the US was weak because we were fighting our own. So in order to prove our strength, we exerted our power on other countries. Realize, that we got our terrotories through fighting for them, except for Hawaii and Alaska. We received Guam and Puerto Rico as a result at first. We fought Spain for Puerto Rico.

tyWacgrGaa	The best way to get into photography is to build a profile. If you wish to work primarily with nature then go to exotic location with great scenery and capture images from a cultivating angle. Once you build a profile you are your own boss (the best way to live). I recommend starting your own website, with samples of your work. From here its up to you to contact businesses (cold calls or walk-ins) and set up interviews.     The best businesses to talk to would be travel agencies, landscaping companies (home and residential), exotic vacation getaways/ hotels, travel brochures, and pretty much any company that can benefit from good imagery like nature magazines and such. Based on where you live the demand for your work may be great or rare.     I recommend starting part time, do photography in your free time, as you get better known and introduced to more companies you may feel more secure in doing this full time. When you are your own boss it's all you, its your decision how hard you work and how motivated you are. Your photographs won't be for everybody and for every time a company says yes, 10 companies will say no. Don't get discouraged, stick with it and be creative. (Remember the better your images are, the more work you can get from word of mouth)|`|Bk4eIAWWaa	I know about three successful landscape/nature photographers and each of them support their habit with tours and seminars.  http://tiborvari.com/workshops/workshops...  http://ronrosenstock.com/tours.htm

W8F9PboZaa	You could deconstruct the books, show examples of bad writing, purple prose, plot holes, one dimensional characters, cliche. Basically a course on how not to write with twilight as an example    Haha if you want to do something pro Twilight... umm honestly if you try and pull apart the books you realise how appallingly written they are. If you want you could also analyse the movie and look at the terrible directing, cutting and acting. Horrah    Honestly I can't think of a single thing. Good luck with that.|`|TlqSAM0naa	That would be really awesome club.=]    Since it's only an hour, maybe read a chapter and have discussion about it. Your ideas were good though.    To mix it up, have other things like contest [they rewrite a chapter & you see what one is best], twilight art [draw characters, etc], && stuff like that.|`|WUwdDxWMaa	Well you could make them have a debate over which charecter is better act out a part as you said even have them watch the movie have them give defanitions of some of the harder words ect theres really many things you could do. have them right a paragraph about what it would be like to be a charecter like bella or edward or about how they think the book should be!|`|CnM2U1bXaa	thats sounds stupid    http://www.twilightfreakscz.webs.com/|`|5Q8vMxuqaa	Lmao..please tell me your kidding? what are you gonna teach them exactly?|`|hvdkLOT3aa	Here are some of the things I think you should do for this:  -read the book and have a book talk  -act out the scenes from the movie and the book  -talk about which you think is better, the movie or the book  -find out how to contact Stephenie Meyer and send her "fan mail"  -watch the movie together  -take a survey on who likes Edward better and who likes Jacob better  -if you get kinda close to these people ask who they think is hotter Taylor Lautner or Robert Pattinson  You don't have to use all of them if you use any, but i hope this helped you out a little bit.|`|Fzn0ObQoaa	I just found an amazing website for you to use! There are teachers that are making actual lesson plans/quizzes based on the series. I'm not even kidding, it's awesome!    http://twilightnovelnovice.com/scholasti...    Some of the ideas include: Dating in the early 1900's (etiquette, etc), How vampires and werewolves evolve from generation to generation     (Slavic vampires are much different from Italian, etc.), thoughts on imprinting, etc.    This site is FULL of educational ideas for Twilight!

So basically it could be:  1. a fun writing class  2. book discussions  3. character dress-up/look alike day (or anything fun like that)    Ooh another suggestion for the writing thing:  Write a story about you and your friends if you all became vampires (the story can include the Cullens or not)    You can all have fun by sharing your stories out loud    Hope I helped!!|`|L9VnwBoAaa	Well, you could pinpiont scenes in the book when their could had been different answers. Like for instance, say Bella decided to stay away from Edward instead of stay with him. You could then have them write out essay on the ending in a different way. They would be learning how to correctly write a paper.|`|SxIwUPwPaa	That would be AWESOME for people who just started the series!|`|OYlX87Qeaa	there are not many educational routes you can go with this story seeing as most of the characters seem to be unrealistic!  the only way i can see this as educational would be analyzing, comparing, and describing, tone, theme, motifs, symbols, and genre.  also, i recommend not using the words, "like," "bestestest," "idk," or "whatever."|`|0YQyJhVXaa	i actually dont really see any way for this course to be educational :( it sounds just like a fan club or something|`|sPYEyTCiaa	Why don't you all borrow the book from somewhere, like start with Twilight and just read in the time you get given, and talk about it in the end.|`|7c0ff0cdc42bafa66ae7ea8350f673d9aa	hmm i can't tell mnuch on how to talk abt twilight.. if i were u, all i can do is to get them watch the movie in the class, then discuss and compare with the books..my idea can be pretty boring and i am sure u got some good ideas up in your head!|`|05e0c89d259c567203ac41de8d961e11aa	Hmm...don't you think that the series by itself is too specialized to talk about it alone for a whole semester? I'm sure you could pull off a month or two, though.    If you can pull Twilight apart for a whole semester, then I could call you a genius.    Pro-Twilight? Err...(none of this agrees with my thinking--I'm not much of a fan of that bad writing)  English--books and their themes, characters, setting, etc.  Debate--easily Edward v. Jacob, or maybe discuss Bella's choices and their consequences.  Math (and physics)--the supernatural speed and strength of the vamps and wolves. You could easily create a math/physics question out of this.  Philosophy--the whole turning into a vamp, the creation of half-vamps, etc.    But a class? This would be better suited for a fan club, by the way...    ~Zara Sahana 007|`|YRmjoluqaa	I think the only way this class could be educational is if you don't talk about Twilight itself, but about the writing, the theme of things that happen, what they signify, things like that. But since there's no reality to the book, it could prove to be difficult to teach on that.|`|fLHV3pmuaa	Are you ******* kidding me? You "worship" Stephenie Meyer? She is without a doubt one of the worst writers I have ever heard of. Reading Twilight caused me to experience actual physical pain.

Honestly, she's awful.|`|RI3O73EXaa	i read the books 2 there wonderful writings i think you should go with whats up there start a play act out twilight sell tickets *im sure you would do better then they did with the movie* yeah so it would be educational and your would raise money   hope i helped |`|b6lVElB4aa	sum1 should kill Stephenie Meyer shes an idiot and twilight stinks ive read all the books and i fell 10 iq points less just for reading the stupid books you should really pick up a GOOD BOOK may i suggest pet semetary by stephen king

c31167b5e58f12167c6e09e90c2a0f0caa	You might get a lot of heat for asking this question and posing this idea.  In reality, crucifixion was just about the most torturous way to die, for what its worth.|`|zzO6Qalsaa	I think not, because GOD sent his Son to live among men and feel everything they felt.EVERYTHING from hunger to sadness to happiness the whole kit and caboodle.No where in the bible does it ever say GOD  came down but it does describe how his only begotten son came to be born on this earth and to die as well.|`|AA10729675	your thought is not my thought.  I never knew a torture which happened more than 2000 years ago could suddenly be interpreted as fake.  Are we becoming so fake that we think that a person on a cross is faking his pain?|`|onkUcy19aa	Jesus Christ was both God and man. As a man, he did not fake his crucifixion but suffered mightily as a man. As God, of course, he did not suffer. That is the mystery of our faith! Good luck to you.|`|E70A7aqcaa	One of the many awesome things about Jesus our Christ is that He COULD have backed out of the Crucifixion, and of all the whippings and thorny crown He received, and all the excruciating pain He suffered at that time, but He knew, without a doubt, that if He didn't experience all that suffering, even the suffering of truly feeling like His Father, God the Father Himself, had truly and completely abandoned Him at His suffering and dying moments, then you and I would never have a chance of joining them in eternal glory and happiness.  And then what would have been the use of God Himself coming down to earth and being born into some cold and abandoned site, to very poor parents, and living in the squalor he lived in, when He could have stayed in Heaven and thoroughly enjoyed the incredible glory that only He and His Father could ever experience.  No reason whatsoever.  So, Jesus must have loved us all, even those unborn of us, in order to suffer such a sorry lifestyle, and horrendous death, that He could NOT fake if the saving of us was to really happen.  I thank Him forever that He did NOT fake it, even though He was more than capable of doing, or avoiding his earthly existence altogether.  God, as in Jesus our Christ, Bless you.|`|94bc2dec827aab848ba69cb5895f7ba6aa	Except that God, or Jesus, is incapable of telling a lie.    One of the biggest symbols of Christ is TRUTH...as He said, 'I am the way, the truth, and the light."  (John 14:6) If Jesus can't lie, he can't 'fake' pain.|`|KyAjmaOyaa	Jesus did not have fake pain or whatever, he had had the maximum pain you can get during his time. He had a crown of thorns shoved and pushed into his head, whipped and maced with sharp material, forced to walk upon a steep road to Golgotha, without any water and dehydrating.  Falling 3 times, and getting whipped to get up, nailed to the cross on hands and feet, he is in a position where he would most likely die from suffocation from the lack of oxygen to reach his lungs. After he died, soldiers stabbed a spear through his heart to make sure he was dead.  And now you have here, talking about how its fake? There was so much sin in the world and the only way people could achieve salvation was through the death of his own son to die for everyone. Even if you know that you are going to be killed the day before, the pain is still the same. I suggest you think about what you have done in life, and how the people around you are like nowadays. Homosexuality, Abortion, Pornography, and a lot of others. Our society is becoming very evil, you see on tv so much bad things. So much violence to each other and hatred.. I would not be surprised if Jesus had come for a Second Time in our Present Time.|`|8465ed09a7111e9ef73563fd6ed0ec22aa	If Jesus, suffering was faked, then the serpents head (Gen. 3:15) would be fake. God himself prophesied the serpent would get head head kicked in. God's love for his children is even more intense, so God had to satisfy his perfect justice with a perfect sacrifice.    Do parents fake the love they have for their children? The answer is no.
x5yHghUVaa	I have the paperback version of Twilight, in my book he confirms that he has been 17 for awhile and various vampire myths like the sun, drinking blood, etc (that make it obvious that he is a vamp) on page 185 and the conversation continues through page 188.

80B6SKataa	The idea for a Hufflepuff came from a cross between the pokemon jigglypuff and the Winnie the Pooh character hefelumps (for which my pet bunny is named btw).   A hufflepuff like the little animal in the link.      People who live in Hufflepuff are the daft people who are dorky enough to still be playing with pokemon.  And watch Winnie the Pooh.  Hence the reason for the name.  There's nothing wrong with them, they're just a bunch of awkward dorks with no social skills.    (Hehe... obviously I'm joking... about some of it...)|`|86oPkfzOaa	There's nothing wrong with Hufflepuffs but they're not exactly smart or strong or anything. In other words, they are pretty much neutral. All houses are good, but Slytherin just has a bad reputation because so many Death Eaters were in Slytherin. And, Hufflepuffs rarely receive glory. You  know, some good people were in Hufflepuff, like Tonks.|`|bAhIkiMLaa	To me they are just the average wizards...not the smartest, not the bravest. But they are certainly better than Slytherin|`|xmeZX8iraa	I think the author needed a name for a house that was just neutral, and the people did not feature prominently in the story.|`|W8F9PboZaa	Initially, in the first book, the house is viewed as a group for "duffers". But from the fourth book on really they gain some pride and respect. To me a Hufflepuff is a hard worker, someone who is extremely loyal and has high morals. They're not as academic as Ravenclaws, as sly as Slytherin's or as courageous as Gryffindor's. Just your average person really.    I personally see myself as a Hufflepuff. Because I definitely don't fit into any of the others. Honestly I think Hufflepuff's feature more prominately then Ravenclaws. Cedric was a Hufflepuff as was Tonks

I don't know how you'd write the rest of your story, but it seems a little flat, blank. And very descriptive. Try and fit the scene around your main character into one or two sentences. Maybe you should add how your character feels, what they smell, how they're feeling. Literary elements like personification and alliteration might help too, along with others. :) Hope this helped!|`|86oPkfzOaa	I would, but the moon and the grass....you went a bit far. I would edit out some of the unnecessary details. Describe too much and the reader would get bored, wanting the action to happen. I would leave it at:  There was a full moon in the sky. It shone bright and had a silver lining on the rim. My eyes were tearing from the cold air that blew onto my face. The moist grass beneath me felt good on my leg. Well not exactly that, but you get what I mean. It's good so far, though.
yiYb9NTraa	When I went into Pre AP English there was a summer reading project over "A Separate Peace". But that was going into it as a Sophmore, the Freshmen didn't have to do one. But Pretty much any book that can fall into the classic literature canon, such as     To Kill a Mockingbird  The Odyssey  Lord of the Flies   Pretty much anything done by Shakespeare or Jane Austen    You can also ask your current English teacher or, if you know the teacher you will have next year. They'll be really helpful and probally be impressed by how interested you are in the class.|`|V0IvGsJvaa	Theres a list on classic books to read before you enter college. The link is below.

Also, I don't know about other schools, but depending on the length of the book, we've spent anywhere from 1/2 to 3  months on each book, doing class discussions, writing response papers, and writing journal entries (our opinion on the use of facades in the books we've read and how they affect our society, for example).    Hope this helps!    ETA:    Just wanted to add that we had to write an essay on A Separate Peace by John Knowles before we got in. We were required to compare the book to a poem and discuss how they expressed (for lack of a better word; I'm a little fuzzy on the details) the nature of friendship. The number of points you received determined whether or not you qualified for the class.
bzvS0659aa	Traits of modernity: linearity, structure, hierarchy, closure, fixed/stable, centers are significant.    Traits of postmodernity: non-linearity, fragmented, non-closure, disrupted, margins are significant.    I would guess, you could be "anti-postmodern" without being "modern" per se but the whole dichotomy of modern versus postmodern is not completely clear itself because it must itself be determined by the categories. If it were clear, then you have already accepted the modern way of thinking. If it is not clear and there is no real closure, then you are more postmodern; however, it is not entirely closed, then how could one be "anti-" to it?|`|FoIxsunVaa	What is the difference between antidisestablishmentarianism and being reactionary?

f2986b83c8bb87ba5ae96c4ebf250e51aa	Oh, I'm glad that you corrected yourself--in the 1020's there was really no change in the lives of women.  :-)    Okay, time to serious up.    The 1920's saw the first sexual revolution.  For the first time in centuries, women's fashions changed radically.  With the shorter skirts, petticoats and bloomers became a thing of the past.  Since legs were now shown, shaving them became a part of good grooming.    Women were viewed as being much freer, sexually, than their mothers had been.  I remember reading a biography of Zelda Sayre Fitzgerald (wife of F. Scott Fitzgerald, author of The Great Gatsby and other works set in the Jazz Age) in which it said, as I recall, ". . . she had a terrible reputation . . . there were the girls who would ride with you in your car and the nice girls who wouldn't . . ."    For all the fears of the moralists that the modern woman was headed to hell in a rumble seat, most of them were nowhere near as promiscuous as many thought.  The vast majority of them settled down, married an acceptable man, and became homemakers just as their mothers and grandmothers had done.    It was their daughters (who went to work during World War II) and granddaughters (the 'peace, sex, and rock 'n' roll' generation) who really got the women's movement going to the point that no one today finds the idea of a female doctor, lawyer, or even construction worker to be shocking, or even very surprising.|`|pK7nkXhPaa	they started to become feminists and stop being traditional|`|heF3HIzQaa	I'm pretty sure you mean the 1920s.    Okay, now you have corrected yourself, let's have some specifics.    1920 - 19th Amendment to Constitution of USA. Women had gained the vote. There's a big change. It was the culmination of many years campaigning and marked a huge change of attitude in society.    1919 - 32 Prohibition. Big change for everyone, and the prohibition movement and women's suffrage movement went hand in hand.    WW1. Ended in 1918. Though not as marked as the change in WW2 (see Rosie the Riveter) , WW1 saw women doing many jobs previously reserved for men - and earning their own money for it. After that, many were unwilling to accept the old roles without question.    And after WW1 everyone wanted to party - hence the roaring 20s.    Fashions have been mentioned. The bra (invented late C19) had now pretty much replaced the girdle, stays etc. Don't underestimate this.    Everyone's lives were changing in the 1920s. Relative prosperity, more travel, better education. And women's live changed moreso even than men's.

DHdK3vVoaa	I think you should pose those questions to her yourself.  I know you've probably talked it all over with her, but you're doing the right thing by being straight with her.  Even if you're getting bad grades in school, you're still trying and it's for her sake, right?  You can promise to this girl that you'll always protect her and provide for her to the best of your abilities.  That's a good start.    I notice that you brought up the fact that you two are of different religions.  Is this such a big significance?  It might be, if you decide stay together indefinitely.  You'll be in contact with her family, who will probably include you in their celebrations and traditions.  Sometimes there will be cultural things that you don't understand, but if you are honest yet open-minded, I think that the religious issue would work out.
YwdFUCQtaa	The Pentax K1000 is the classic students' camera; fills the specifications you set out, cheap (second-hand), robust, Pentax lenses are among the best you can buy; failing that go for a Nikon FM2; perhaps a little pricier but still good. Nikon glass is pretty good, too.|`|oq6ofi72aa	Any 35mm film SLR will work.  I used a Pentax K1000 for my high school classes and it was a great camera.  It costs around $100 and can be found almost everywhere.  You can get newer cameras with automatic settings, but they cost a little more.  You should be able to find a decent camera for $200 or less.|`|v7Wflu78aa	Are you going to buy a used or new camera?|`|HjVjSI6uaa	a 35mm camera is the basic nondigital camera. you know, the kind everyone used to own 5 years ago.  the cheapest ones may not come with manual shutter speed and apeture settings, but they are only a step up.  just go to a camera store and an employee will have no trouble at all finding what you need.|`|AA11368393	An extremely good 35mm SLR camera is a Canon AE-1.  These are an older camera and you can usually find a good deal on one on ebay.  When shopping make sure you are buying the camera body AND the lens.  Some people will sell just the camera body.  Also read the description carefully because sometimes people will sell a camera for parts.|`|AA12339318	This is kind of like trying to purchase a "good" used car.  If you don't know how to shop for one and know what you are looking for, then you'd better limit your shopping to trusted sources.    Like buying a used unit on eBay.  Even if they offer some kind of guarantee, you still have to go through the trouble of sending it back and HOPING the sellere honors the guarantee, and then, you STILL have to go out and find another camera.    I suggest you check with the local camera specialty stores.  They often take in trade-ins and sell these used cameras for a reasonable price.  They may not offer prices as low as you might get though some classified ads, but, with the store's reputation on the line, an established camera store is more likely to stand behind any procucts they sell.  Don't be afraid to shop around different stores.Designer, Illustrator and Desktop Publisher for over 30 years|`|XL62syrCaa	When I started in photography in high school they had us use a nikon fm10. it is a good sturdy manual camera. everything is manual, it does have a very good light sensor that is easy to use. it is fairly in expensive. i found it on ebay for just over $100.  http://catalog.ebay.com/Nikon-FM10-35mm-...  i liked it and still think a full manual is the only way to truly learn to take high quality photography.
46zxsu1haa	Well, you are kind of late if you are looking for this year. Most auditions are in January for July programs. There are some that are later in NYC, if that is the part of NY you are interested in.    Ballet SI's for August: BAE and Manhattan Youth Ballet (Studio Maestro.) Auditions are soon check their sites.(Fantastic programs!)    STEPS on Broadway has both a ballet & contemporary dance SI.    Paul Taylor (modern) in July (Lincoln Center area at Lauardia Arts)  Parsons dance (modern) (in June) at Marymount, college NYC    Alvin Ailey has a ballet/modern SI (not sure of audition dates)    December edition of Dance mgazine has SI listings. You could check   their website.    SAB and ABT are finished with their auditions for the summer programs.    Check the Ballet Talk website for great info about (ballet) SIs.    It would be more helpful if you let me know what type of dance and where in NY you are looking.  Hope I was able to give you some useful information.|`|hmQTiuDTaa	ABT is where I've always wanted to go. It is supposed to be AMAZING!!! But, it's also a little pricey. Alvin Ailey might have a program, and theirs would include some modern training also. Both these would be great opportunities. Sorry that I don't have more. If you ask your teacher, she could probably recommend the ones she thinks would benefit you most.
ikMOb6gcaa	The great thing about poetry is that it can mean many different things to many different readers.  One of the things I like best when people read my poetry is when they say, "Oh, I see you meant such-and-so," when really I meant something else . . . especially if I can see where they're coming from.  To me it means that the poem actually made them think about it, or that it meant something to them, or simply that it was a 1/2way decent poem.    In college, I had a couple professors (I majored in English with a concentration in Creative Writing) that said that "this or that" was EXACTLY what a poet meant when he or she wrote . . . whatever.  Did they ever back it up?  Not often -- maybe 3 times in 5 years of school.  The ONLY way that there can be ONE interpretation to a poem is if the author comes out and says "this is what it means . . ." and even then the reader is always free to take something else from it.    Teachers, professors, all of them that don't get it . . . you can't really say much; sometimes you have to play their game while knowing that they are wrong.  I mean, you can disagree and tell them so, but when it comes to test day . . . be careful.  Been there, done that.|`|1oh4BN32aa	Yes. Poetry is all about interpretation and analysis. The important part is that you make sure you're not putting your own sensibilities too much into your own interpretations. I'm not accusing you of that, it's just something to watch out for. A lot of high school teachers don't bother getting into it because it can be tough enough to get students to get through the basics, so they don't want to tell kids that, for example, along with the difficulty of understanding Hamlet at a language and plot level, there are a lot of ways to analyze the characters in the play, as well.    The same thing applies to poetry. In my experience, all but the most stodgy college professors are open to varying readings of a text. Sometimes they might seem critical and resistant but that's also usually because they know the field pretty well (in a general sense, and ideally) and they aren't likely to let you build an untenable analysis.    Last thing is, just because you see it differently than the teacher doesn't make it incorrect or correct. The only thing that will make any reading valid is being able to back it up with historical context or biographical information or--most importantly--textual evidence. If you're not sure how to go about building evidence for a reading, ask another question or talk to your English teacher. S/he would probably be pretty excited to see a student interested in getting pretty deep into the writing.
utbfT0APaa	The first mistake that new beginners make is getting a cheap guitar.  Cheap guitars are very hard to play and thus a beginner will soon loose interest.

3869ce6f464c4ffaa9e044f0bf459360aa	They are not aware, as you are, that they are our kin, and each other's. They are deludedly believing that they are really different because of small and superficial differences such as language and style of government.     Some of them have minds filled with seriously unpleasant thoughts, such as hatred, fear, jealousy, and greed.    As a result they are suffering. Pain, bereavement, destruction of property, displacement, loss of hope....     And they may learn wisdom. 70 years ago it wasn't "them on other continents", it was "us, here in Europe". Now we are building a new world order - our multicultural society (especially in London), our European Union that runs from the Celtic Sea to the Black Sea. Despite all its frictions, its excess bureaucracy, this non-violent, multi-cultural, co-operative coexistence is the future. It is a model for their world too.     And we too have yet to learn fully. What is happening in Zimbabwe, in Rwanda, in Palestine is also happening on a much smaller scale on the Cathall Estate in Leytonstone and the Kingsland wastes in east Hackney.     What Hackney and the world needs is for human values to be embedded in everyone's hearts - peace, love, truth, harmoniousness, positive thinking.

You should read books that are right for you, and not because they are considered classics.

It is simultaneously a history lesson, a satire, an anti-war manifesto, a sci-fi adventure, a great piece of fiction and totally hilarious. Vonnegut was one of the best writers I've ever had the privilege of reading, and this is THE place to start if you're getting acquainted with him. Also, it's one of the seminal books of 20th century literature, even though a lot of high schools in America don't teach it.|`|AA11614705	"The Little Prince"    it's really such a simple book, and some libraries actually catalog it in the children's section. the story is whimsical and light, but it has such a deeper meaning beneath it. Antoine de Saint-Exupry wrote it, so it is primarily written in French, but the translations really keep the tone of the story. the story starts with the narrator, an aviator, getting stranded in the desert and comes upon a small child-like person (the prince) and it goes on to tell of the mystery of how the Prince came to be in the desert. a truly moving and charming novella.    p.s. it has illustrations too. they really fit the book.|`|20ffe6Cbaa	To Kill A Mockingbirb by Harper Lee  Pride & Prejudice by Jane Austen  The Outsiders|`|vmmMqhxXaa	Absolutely, positively "Huckleberry Finn."  It's a great adventure story, and so is fun to read, but it's also a profound social commentary on racism, individuality, and freedom.  Even deeper, it explores how we can treat people condescendingly or respectfully -- as children/inferiors or adults/equals.  Both Huck and Jim get treated both ways.    Short stories are fun, too.  You can't go wrong with stories by Jack London, Mark Twain, Alice Walker, Edgar Allen Poe, and Kurt Vonnegut.|`|Yt3dLSJUaa	The Fountainhead.

Frankly I think it sounds 5th grade level|`|N2O9LUwaaa	It's a little cliche, but if you can think of some cool twist it might be cool. I am a bit of a fantasy writer myself, and in that genre it is hard not to use old, beaten down ideas, simply because there are so many books out there.     I would suggest try tying it into mythology, either local or global, and you HAVE to come up with an interesting weakness for the monster that the townspeople can exploit to achieve victory. Maybe vulnerability to a certain material, the tears of an orphan, etc.    I also think that maybe this might be better if it was set in a more mid evil setting, but I don't know the whole story so maybe not.    Also, try to make the monster as unique as you can, not your stereotypical tentacled, slimy swamp monster. Give it special abilities and a special (and terrifying) appearance.    On to characters. Don't jump right into the plot, or jump in then backtrack to beforehand. Give some character development first. In a horror story like this, if a character dies that you hardly knew and didn't really like, then no one cares. But if you got to know the character first, and knew how they thought, lived, knew their family, etc. then it is a blow when they die. The point of horror is to invoke an emotional response. If you are not emotionally involved then it won't be scary.    Hope this helps, and remember: it is your story. Write it the way that you want, and have fun doing it. If someone criticizes it, listen and see if they have a valid point, but in the end it's up to you.|`|pWnsUHMBaa	i think it could be a little more descriptive.  but other than that, i love it|`|u67vUVasaa	i think the answers that say    OH I LOVE IT    are jus trying to kiss ur butt and get the best answer
M2thieHqaa	In 1494, the Roman Catholic Church--under the leadership of Pope Alexander VI--divided the world between the Spanish and the Portuguese; both powers had the exclusive right to exploit the New World by any means, in return for spreading Catholicism! This was the Treaty of Tordesillas, later strengthened by the Treaty of Saragossa.     Consider that for a moment: the head of Christendom hands two of the most powerful governments in the world 2/3 of an entire planet and says, "Do as you please." They can take what ever they like, enslave native peoples, stripmine countries for gold, chop down forests, loot temples, anything at all; as long as there are a few priests and missionaries along for the ride. Of course they're going to explore!    Out of this exploration came the Spanish Empire, and the Portuguese control of India. Both kingdoms became extremeley wealthy and powerful for the next 150 years. Then the British and Dutch started to horn in and depose them, but that's another story.|`|Shp5riE6aa	Fountain of youth, fabled cities of gold.|`|xJoMSkI5aa	Spain organized a huge imperial system to exploit the land, labor, and mineral wealth of the New World.

Most of the great early European explorers were sent on missions by Christian monarchs, eg Columbus was commissioned by Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain.  The explorers usually relied heavily on spiritual guidance to help them through the tribulations of exploring the globe: disease, malnutrition, starvation, murder, and the harsh elements in general.  Jesuit priests would also travel along to introduce the word of God to any heathens they might encounter, to set up missions, and build churches (usually on top of temples).  Many of the most important cities in the New World today started out as Jesuit missions.  These explorers sought adventure on the high seas and in strange exotic lands but also the glory of discovering new continents, majestic new mountains, mighty new rivers, etc, many that would later bear their name - "America" was named after Amerigo Vespucci .  In doing so they could earn eternal fame and recognition, greater socio-economic status, political power, and not least of all, favor and grace of the monarchy which hired them.  Finally, these explorers sought wealth in the form of precious metals and jewels, as well as in the form of land and slaves, and political power itself (the explorers and their parties would become wealthy slaveowners and rulers).  The monarchies who hired them, in turn, also benefitted enormously from the gold, silver, precious gems, the (free) slave labor exacted from the various native populations, the aquisitions of massive amounts of new lands on which to grow crops, raise animals for food and clothing, etc, and all this gave them an edge economically and, as a consequence, militarily, among other nations.  Spain, for example, experienced the height of its power during the Age of Exploration and Portugal ending up increasing the size of its empire tremendously.
D3rUImGQaa	I think the book is way better too. The movie characters were attractive and you could see that they tried to make it good, but I don't think it measures to the book. Lets hope New Moon is better, with a new director and what not :D|`|MlZay5VHaa	I think the movie is better than the book. I greatly dislike the books. The reason for my negative opinion of the Twilight books is mainly the underdeveloped characters. They're just too perfect and I can't relate to them. Edward of course is flawless so he doesn't need to develop at all. This irritates me because I enjoy reading about a character who grows and learns. Edward doesn't develop as a character. To me, he is just a blatant Gary-Stu. Bella is the same way. She is meant to have "flaws" when those flaws (clumsiness, modesty) can't be considered character flaws at all really. And, like Edward, she doesn't develop. And, forgive me for saying so, but she is just so dang annoying! She is a whinny damsel in distress who can't live without a man. In New Moon I was hoping to see a stronger Bella but I was greatly disappointed. One other thing that I dislike about the series is the lack of any moral or theme. After reading Eclipse I assumed that the books were about sacrificing for your loved ones, but Breaking Dawn proved me wrong; Bella sacrifices....nothing. Nothing at all. She gets everything, literally EVERYTHING that she wants. She turns into a beautiful vampire, she maintains a relationship with Jacob and her family, she has no weaknesses (weaknesses that someone in her situation would normally have) and she gets a great superpower *cough-marysue-cough*, and she even gets the perfect child to add to the giant heap of perfect characters. The only aspect of human life that she sacrifices is getting old, and she makes it obvious in the series that aging, to her, is extremely formidable. So you can't really consider it a sacrifice can you?    I hope I'm not offending any Twilight fans by saying this. It is just my opinion.|`|daza5A4vaa	In any series, the book will be better than the movie.  But in this case, the Twilight movie was dreadful. They totally raped the story.|`|J8NEZ4V0aa	the book is definitely better than the movie   it just had more detail, obviously   but the movie was amazing, too|`|l3b0hjdWaa	I think the book is way better!  The feel I got from the movie was just serious. I loved how there's humor in the book. The book shows Bella's personality more whereas in the movie, it doesn't look like she has much of a personality. In the movie, Jasper just looked weird. They didn't explain that he was starting not to drink human blood and that's why he looked like he was in pain all of the time. Carlisle made a comment about it when Bella met the family but I didn't catch on to what he was talking about until after I read the book. It wasn't even until after I watched that part again that I realize what he was talking about. Alice seemed like she was always high in the movie. they made her act really weird.|`|Q6x1gSlKaa	ugh. the book was ok but the movie was dreadful. the cast was WAY off, the way it was filmed gave me a head ache, it was so low budget, it was just plain sad and pathetic.|`|IKX1QtUBaa	Yes the book is more detailed, therefore it is better.|`|IUQZFrMfaa	I DO!!!!

gnbBIRu6aa	Italian Fascism was already firmly established by the time Hitler came to power. In fact for a time Mussolini considered himself to be the senior partner in the relastionship.     So as for the relationship Hitler had directly on Italy before 1943 very little. Once Italy joined the Axis their entry to WWII was inevitable but mussolini did show initial reluctance. Italy attacked Greece in 1941 which was a disaster likewise the war in North africa, in both conflicts Germany was obliged to send troops to help.     Prior to 1943 Italy was completly independent of germany and took some pride in demonstrating this independence. For example they refused to hand over Jews to the SS. After mussolini was removed from power Italy attempted to surrender to the Allies which resulted in ferocious german response against Italian troops. Hundreds of thousand Italian soldiers were murdered or forced to work as slave labour, Hitler refused to accept them as POWs.    Italy from 1943 was treated as any other occupied country. which resulted in devestation.|`|zzO6Qalsaa	Try www.moreorless.au.com should give you some answers

Yes, it's a wonderful book and each time that I read it I come up with other ideas.  I would say, The Old Man and the Sea is a must read once a year.  Also The Pearl by Steinbeck is also a must read each and every year.  That reminds me I have not started either one this year.  Yes, they are real, live lessons in those books.  They are symbolic some too.  Read more from HEmingway, his books are great.  Most of all his books are from his life experiences. Did you know that he really did drive an ambulance in the war time?
bzvS0659aa	It is because studies show that most people assume that an online user is White, male, heterosexual, and able-bodied. In studies of online chatrooms, people were asked to guess ages, sex, etc. of people and were surprised when those that were known to be Doctors were female and one named Tom was quadrapalegic. It is simply an assumption people have about who they are talking to online, and it is often false.    As far your avatar, the clockwork apple plays on the clockwork orange is interesting. First, it suggests literary minded, yet many users will not get the Clockwork Orange reference, so it will not suffice in that manner. Second, it may need to be "read" simply as the visual--a clock shaped like an apple. This leads to all kinds of cultural expressions that are male and few that have female elements. First, the clock has very male elements: (1) it is technical and we usually associate that with masculine--how many female mechanics do you know? now, how many male mechanics do you know? (2) the hands of a clock are very phallic, if we move to Freudian psychoanalysis--it has both a short and a long version. Second, the apple draws to mind two cultural stories...if you are religious, it brings Adam and Eve into play...if you are scientific, it brings Newton into play. Obviously, the Newton reference is masculine. The Adam and Eve story could be argued both ways but note that it is rarely ever called the "Eve and Adam" story.|`|8msce8KPaa	definitely a rant|`|IVy35SE2aa	Sorry, I always get it wrong.

And, in answer to your question(s) about why so many people here seem to assume (wrongly) that you're a man.  My guess is this--  the graphics pictures gears & mechanical type items-- most folks may just mentally associate such as that with the old stereotype of mainly men being mechanically-gifted.    I am guessing at this next bit, too.  It could be  because of the similarity to the title of the book and movie called  "A Clockwork Orange".  I'm not going to venture any further guesses here.|`|spYpsixUaa	My wife can tell that you are female, and I just assumed that she was right.  But then again, anybody who has seen "Meet The Robinsons" knows that she's always right.    However, my wife has also said "I Like her!" right after laughing raucously at one of your answers.  So, that might shed some light on the confusion.  Men tend to be more thoughtless of people's feelings when making fun of something or just plain making a joke.  Insensitive humor is generally seen to be the Man's playground.  So, when you make daring jokes, people assume that you must be male, "'Cuz you gotta have some big cajones to say something like that in public!"|`|eezP5wQ2aa	...Megan, their myopic vision and bias opinion of ones ignorance...  ...good luck...|`|AA11488628	people generally assume anyone they do not know as male. God is considered male, huMAN race. people go around calling everyone dude, man, and guys. even when talking to a group of all women people still do it. heck i have a completely unisex name so even when people know my name they think i am male. even though it is more commonly a woman's name in this country. but then my friend's dad's real name is Mary. it was supposed to be marion but got screwed up. he goes by mike. so people will just assume you are male because we assume anyone we do not know as male if we do not know their names, what their voices sound like, or any other facts that would help us figure out their gender if we even really thought about it. and yeah mechanical things are sexistly considered "male" things. even in today's world most engineers are male. it is still a mans world out there and women are just starting to rewrite the rules for ourselves so we no longer have to play by the rules that where set up for men but do not fit women. that might have sounded like a rant but ah well.|`|sxKaorAXaa	Cuz yer cold hearted and calculating and your avatar shows.|`|JIwKRZADaa	In most languages, whenever the gender of the person isn't  given, it is assumed to be male.

In my many years in various chat rooms and such, the ratio of men to women has been about 4 to 1 favoring males.

Find a parts pattern on line or take apart an old shoe if you can't imagine what the toe, sides, heel, tongue, etc. should look like, but draw them big.  I would suggest 1/4" plywood for the sole about 3 feet long, cut to shape and flat foam board for the raised heel (I am thinking of a man's shoe) Consider adding some blocks to help form the upper to size.  Form the upper from cardboard like shirt cardboard that you can push and form and bulge - poster board with paper on both sides is probably too strong to form.  You may need to do each piece twice to be able to form with the thinner stuff and glue together - spray adhesive may work nicely.  The upper, depending on style, will have the edges rolled under and glued or go straight down to the sole (like a gym shoe) and be tacked.      There are materials which would be great at forming with heat or solvents, but I don't think you have time to find them and learn.

Like Manga....|`|AA12078704	(You did not state what kind of books you like reading, nevertheless)  Try James Joyce's Ulysses or Finnegan's Wake, perhaps start with his books Dubliners or The Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (providing you have not read them already). Read, perhaps, Borges or Kafka. If you like philosophy and psychology try Nietzsche (The Birth of Tragedy, Thus Spoke Zaratustra etc) or Freud (Group Psychology and the Analysis of Ego) and then move on to Jurgen Habermas, Jacques Derrida, Paul Ricoeur etc. Going back to literature you could try Virginia Woolf, maybe Mrs Dalloway or her very interesting essay "In a Room of One's Own", or even Tostoyevski's "Crime and Punishment", Tolstoy's "War and Peace", John Steinbeck's "Of Mice and Men" and "The Grapes of Wrath". Last but not least take a look at Paul Theroux's "The Mosquito Coast".    I hope I mentioned something you have not already read.
jVk1CP1laa	From my experience I never heard of a software that can resize photos in one click..   As for the quality, it won't get affected when reducing the photo size, but enlarging it will cause some quality loss depending on how large you would make it. Maybe sharpening the photo after the enlargement can help a bit..
3pHoY8F6aa	Love is not a thing you can do.  But when you do other things, love will happen.      There are small things you can do----sitting together, looking at the moon, listening to music----nothing directly to do with love. Love is very delicate, fragile. If you look at it, gaze at it directly, it will disappear. It comes only when you are unaware, doing something else. You cannot go directly, arrow-like. Love is not a target. It is a very subtle phenomenon; it is very shy. If you go directly, it will hide. If you do something directly, you will miss it.    The world has become very stupid about love. They want it immediately. They want it like instant coffee----whenever you want it, order it, and it is there.    Love is a delicate art; it is nothing you can do. Sometimes those rare blissful moments come...then something of the unknown descends. You are no longer on the earth; you are in paradise. Reading a book with your lover, both deeply absorbed in it, suddenly you find that a different quality of being has arisen around you both. Something surrounds you both like an aura, and everything is peaceful. But you were not doing anything directly. You were just reading a book, or just going for a long walk, hand-in-hand against the strong wind----and suddenly it was there. It always takes you unaware.|`|4f2071ce0b3deda8b527470042c9a809aa	I think you choose what sort of person you want to love, and then when you meet them, it just happens.|`|gspTDufpaa	Love sometimes just happens.

All shows have their good and bad points, with enough talent to last for a long time.  It also depends on the personal taste of an audience to determine how good the show is.  Overall, though...some of the best shows are    Les Miserables  The Phantom of the Opera  Sweeney Todd  Rent  Spring Awakening  Sunset Boulevard  A Chorus Line  The Music Man  Wicked (Yes, I mean it.)  Chicago  Into The Woods  Evita  Pirates of Penzance  Spamalot    The list just goes on and on...I can't name all of the amazing shows out there, but this is a pretty good list.|`|sRw9oiQdaa	My personal choice would be Les Miserables, but I knwo not everyone would agree with me...|`|jPcRG4V7aa	Phantom. no discussion.|`|j7o7RsZKaa	ya les mis is good but SPRING AWAKENING all the way!!!

All of the books are poorly written. The characters and plot lack depth, the story lacks themes and symbolism (the cover doesn't count) and any hint of other literary devices, and the plot is very messy; a result of not planning the series out.    The characters. Edward and Bella are uninteresting without each other. They have no real personality. They're both very bland, and though they make the occasional witty remark, the book is filled with nothing but Edward and Bella staring at each other. Bella will say she loves him and that she's not afraid of him. He'll answer that he's not right for her, that they shouldn't be together because he's dangerous, but say that he loves her and he'll be with her, anyway. That's the dialogue between the two main characters for the entire length of the book.    On top of this, Edward is controlling, manipulative, and stalkerish In short, borderline abusive. He watches Bella sleep at night, standing in a corner of her room. Watching someone sleep while in bed with them is completely different- *that* is romantic. Not standing in a corner. He follows her to Port Angeles without her knowledge. That's weird. He never lets Bella make her own decisions. She doesn't want to go to prom, but he takes her, anyway. She wants to see Jacob, he disables her car so that she can't. She doesn't want to go to college, but he forces her into filling out applications. It's true that he was trying to have her do the right thing and everything, but he needs to respect her decisions. If she wants to go to college, she'll fill out applications on her own. If she doesn't want to go to prom, she doesn't want to go. And he's manipulative especially in Eclipse. When she tells him she wants to have sex with him, he puts her entire life into a deal. The only way he'll have sex with her is if she marries him, and after that, he'll change her. This site has more information on all of this: http://www.gaiaonline.com/forum/recycle-...    Bella. A flat character who lets Edward walk all over her. A character without morals. She lies to Charlie about where she's going and who she'll be with so that she can be with Edward. (And how does Charlie not notice this, but he's the Police Chief? Plot hole number 1, ladies and gentlemen.) She ignores everyone human because they're simply not good enough for her. They're not supercool vampires. They don't make her happy. She goes into this huge depression after Edward leaves for months and months. What does this say to high schoolers? That if your boyfriend breaks up with you, it's the end of the world?    The plot. The practically nonexistant plot. In Twilight, any sign of an actual plot comes about 3/4 of the way through the novel. It's absolutely fine to have romance as a plot, but nothing happened at all, besides Edward and Bella fighting each other over whether Bella could be turned or whether the relationship is right, etc. etc. etc. But the plot is slapped on at the end, the ballet thing, as if Meyer realized at the last second that she actually needed a plot. And that was when she introduced James, Laurent, and Victoria.     In New Moon, she sulks for about five months after Edward leaves. And after those five months, she spends time with Jacob (again, not her human friends) and kind of sort of gets over the pain. And then, once again, there is a plot slapped on at the end, and this is the whole "let's save Edward" thing. (And can I just point out that she, once again, leaves home -and the continent- without telling Charlie what's going on? She lies to him.)    Eclipse. This has more of a plot. The triangle between Jacob, Edward, and Bella. You need a theme? The problem with themes in this series is that anything with potential is just cancelled out somewhere else in the series. But I'll try. A theme consists of a topic and the message. The topic could be "friendship" or "love." Personally, I think the only theme that doesn't cancel out is "love is friendship." This would apply to Jacob, because they were friends in New Moon before they fell in love. Edward, she was never friends with. Love at first sight, remember? And a moral. See, here's where you have a real problem. I shouldn't have to explain much, because I've already gone over how immoral Bella and Edward are. I guess, again pertaining to Jacob because he is the most realistic character, it could be "peristence is the answer." He wouldn't give up on Bella.    Breaking Dawn. Not only is BD not well written, it's just completely absurd. Meyer broke many of her own rules in order to give the characters their happy ending. Imprinting is rare, but everyone ends up imprinting. The Volturi are supposed to be fierce and power-hungry, but they leave Edward, Bella, and Renesmee as if they were old friends and maybe they'd catch up later, sometime. Aro tore Caius from his lover in order to keep him in the Volturi. But he does nothing to the Cullens? That's hard to believe. And then there's Bella's actual pregnancy. How is that possible? We're never given a reason, Meyer just tells us (last second, once again) that it's happened, before. And even if she could give us a good reason, why didn't Carlisle, the best doctor you could find anywhere, or Edward, a hundred-year-old genius, think that Edward could inject venom into Bella's body while having sex? Venom is the only fluid in the vampire's body. So how could it not get inside Bella and turn her? There was no thought put into this. And lastly, why does everyone get a happy ending when nobody deserved it? Not that they're all bad people, it's just that it's not realistic. Especially for Jacob, who was the doomed character from the very beginning. He lost the girl he loved, but imprinted on her daughter? Not only is that si|`|7Xcl9XLoaa	I LOVE TWILIGHT!!!!!|`|hrT2Zs88aa	first of all i don't think that jacob is a totally perfect human. it kinda seems like he can't let go of bella even when he knows that she only likes him as a friend. for me that would really bug me if a guy kept going after me when i liked somebody else a lot more than him|`|WE867PBoaa	Well breaking dawn.. its too happy ending ish T_T  THATS WHY..

Z4FgusRPaa	I have never heard of this book so I looked it up on amazon.com. I didnt see a lot of good reviews but heres what one person said about the book, 'The Sign of the Chrysanthemum is a book about a boy named Muna. Muna is a name that people would laugh about; some might say, "What kind of name is that?" People teased Muna because of his name. Muna doesn't want to be tease anymore and wants to be a man, so he would try to find his father, who is a warrior. Muna used to lived only with his mother and him, without a father with them. Then Muna's mother died and decides to find his father, so people won't tease him. But before Muna's mother died, she said some descriptions about his father. His father is a warrior and has a chrysanthemum tattoo. But that is the only things that Muna knows about his father. So the journey begins with some adventures.  I think that this book is okay, but it isn't really that good. I wanted to give the rate to be 3 and a half, but it doesn't have it. But in the other hand, it was a little bit good. Muna had some dreams about his father. This book was kind of boring, but there are adventures that are exciting. This book has some pictures in it and is kind of short. I enjoy reading part of the story, it is a good book.' So it is up to you on if you would want to read it or not.   Hope this was what you were looking for.|`|dXW9cPWMaa	Clearly you are not the "lil wise one," especially since you're asking us to even do the dirty work for you.

BBfIXcI0aa	Some questions are raised:  Why did you choose to make the character a paraplegic? What does his disability have to do with his role in the play? Does it mean something special, symbollically, or is it just there?  What does his former military career have to do with gay people? Why was his buddy killed? What bearing does that have on the story? Were he and his buddy sexually involved? Why was his wife in an accident? What does that have to do with the curren situation? How did it make him more or less eager to help the gay couple?  Who is this friend helping him? Is he/she connected to the military, the dead buddy, or the wife? How did they get into the story? How are they qualified to help?  How did they both hear about this gay couple? Why do they want to help them? How do they help them? Are they opposed to homosexuality at any point? Have they been? Do they care about all gay marriage, or just this couple? How do they achieve this change? Is that how it really works? If it's that simple, why hasn't it been done?    In a play, unlike a novel, there is little room for extraneous information. Every word, every character, and every complication need to count. The rule of thumb is that if the play wouldn't fall apart without it, it doesn't need to be there. Sit down, and think about the story you're wanting to tell. What is its natural beginning, middle, and end? Who are the characters? How do they get from point A to B to C? Why should the audience care if they do?    You need to figure out WHAT you're writing - a One Act, or a full play with two or three acts. The simpler, the better, no matter what, but the longer forms allow for more freedom and require exponentially more skill.

The US decided to only be concerned about countries in its Monroe Doctrine or new colonies like the Phillipines. Therefore it intervened in revolutions and insurrections in the Honduras and nicauragua but stayed out of the League of nations (the precursor to the UN) and politicians had to be careful to only preach about home economy and domestic issues rather than world issues. They did see a need to modernize the armed forces but this did not mean adequately preparing for any coming war.

O3k4t0i9aa	He was a minister of the Second Great Awakening. He is often called the "Father of Modern Revivalism." He was known for innovations in preaching and religious meetings, such as having women pray in public in mixed gender congregations (which had never been done before), development of what is known as the "anxious bench" (where those who were contemplating becoming Christians could receive prayer from Christians), and public censure by name of individuals in sermons and prayers, as well as being known for his use of extemporaneous preaching.   Finney was the most famous religious revivalist during this period in this particular area. While groups such as the Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormons, and Seventh-day Adventists became closed and exclusivist, Finney was widely accepted and influential amongst more mainstream groups. Finney never started his own denomination or church and never claimed any form of prophetic leadership above other evangelists and revivalists.

It will be better that way than if you hurry, especially at the end.|`|uGezRb7Xaa	if you want it published  at LEAST 100-200 typed, double-spaced pages  The girl who wrote The Outsiders  was 15 when she wrote it, good luck|`|OjQxKGC0aa	It should be exactly how long it needs to be. Not one word more, and not one word less.|`|khM3eZnZaa	Honestly I am your age and I realized that the number of pages doesn't matter as much as what is in them. I know you are not looking for this answer but it is true because it is really only to the extent of what you are capable of not of how much you can talk lol. But I guess I would expect the same amount of pages from anyone else just because of your age doesn't mean you should limit yourself to what is expected. You should go beyond your own expectations and just that your creativity flow.|`|09bd9071f261e20518478352da1dad4daa	There is no correlation between your age and the number of pages which will comprise your prospective novel.  For it to be recognized as a (generic) novel, you will need to write at least 150 pages, I would think, in the event that you are aspiring to write for publication.  Otherwise, you can write whatever number of pages you require to tell the story which you are imagining.  Make an outline for your novel, then expand upon that as you write; include dialogue and descriptive passages, and concentrate upon making the story intriguing and compelling with conflicts to be overcome.  Good luck!|`|9f68a1f4952a6fb1e0cfb91da91a5105aa	Make sure it all you want to say, just write it. Congrads on taking on the challedge of writting|`|tC02KPckaa	As many as you want.

Then, I'd pick back up again in the next chapter at some point while they were on the road. Maybe somebody cut them off, or she'd just woken up.    I'm not quite sure if that was what you were looking for, but I hope I helped.    Good luck with your story! It sounds interesting.|`|hSQIv8Araa	What's the question again? It was sorta unclear.

yPflRYPUaa	Try different moods, you may be asked to sing more than one.  Don't sing anything from Wicked, as tempted as you may be, so many people sing the same songs and don't stand out.    I'd advice a slow song and a happy, brighter song.  Slow:  I don't know how to love him - Jesus Christ Superstar  Nothing Really Happened - Is There Life After High school? (A Personal favourite)    Brighter:   Mister Snow - Carousel (Not very low now I think about it)  Some People - Gypsy (Sounds brighter than it is, and can be sung low)      All these have a good to incorporate actions, best of luck! :D|`|j7o7RsZKaa	if ur a teen try something from 13 the Broadway musical|`|DF4GtT9Haa	I sing alto and mezzo - some of my favorite audition songs are "Anyone Can Whistle" Sondheim and "Shy" from Once Upon a Mattress.

c243cce83e07d939a303e68734f4bd82aa	I did for a few months, and while it wasn't completely void of useful experience, sales and customer turnover was stressed over the actual photography.  The company I was with preferred to train salespeople to shoot, rather than training photographers to sell.  And sessions were limited to about 15-20 minutes.  I didn't get any training on lighting, or camera settings (good thing I already knew what I was doing- I actually showed my manager a thing or two about the different camera settings).  BUT- I have to admit that I did gain valuable experience working with people.  I learned a lot in the way of posing (for individuals and groups), and of interacting with people (young, old, and in-between) to get the kind of expressions and  responses that make good portraits.  So while, it wasn't a complete waste of time, I wasn't happy at that particular studio.  I guess your experience will depend on the type of company/studio you work for.

These warriors were gathered from the various outlying discontented regions, unhappy with paying the high tributes exacted by the empire.  Cortes' woman/Aztec guide la malinche played a huge role in this because she had contacts with many of the outlying provinces, was adept at many languages, and a quick learner in Spanish.     Its been a few years since I gathered these factoids from various dictionaries, common history books, and I have been wanting to read more from sources of the day, such as: the cronicas (diaries of Cortes and others living at the time) as well as accounts from Fray Bartolome de las Casas and other priests of the day. My discipline hasn't matched my ambitions, but I'm working on that one.
lQMCENkRaa	Firstly:  If your vigilantism is inspired by a need to enforce the law, then it is inherently not justified... as vigilantism is illegal.     Breaking the law to uphold the law is different than  breaking the law to stand for what is right.    Secondly: Justification require someone to justify something. So therefore, justification is subjective. What is right is also subjective.     So if you wanna be a caped crusader, go nuts.  Just make sure that your notion of right and wrong is clear and distinct to you.     Also, wear body armor, take some martial arts and parkour lessons.        Edit:  Batman isn't that great. His only power is he can throw a bat-arang and it come back to him, even though its shaped like a bat.  His villains make him great.|`|AA11635601	No, the citizen's responsibility at that point is to confront the government and demand change to remedy the problem.|`|YmtNel5haa	Technically no it isn't justified.  At birth you automatically enter the social contract.  You give up part of your autonomy for what the government provides.  If you take that back(autonomy), it's not fair to everybody else and you are just as bad as the lawbreakers are.  but, I really don't necessarily agree with that.  But you also have to consider if the person that is accused is truly guilty.  The criminal Justice system is flawed (ran by humans-no human is perfect so how could a system run by humans be perfect?) so in fact there are instances where the wrong people go down for a crime that they did not commit.  The idea of batman is nice, but problematic.  Of course he worked with the police, didn't he?|`|I6D7xdcVaa	Always and never. It depends on the law enforced and who is being punished. And the amount of force must be fair to the crime.|`|OqlXBUsaaa	in relation to government, no.  vigilantes rise because the gov't is not "vigilant" enough.    and laws are easily amplified more than vigilantes|`|jVZ7HbDsaa	Depending on the extremity of a crime and the action taken by the vigilante in attempt to bring justice to the crime, I believe that vigilantism can be both just and severly wrong.   I presonally feel that sometimes the law is indeed insufficient in the means that it punishes wrong-doers, however, many times, aren't the vigilantes themselves just as much a criminal for going against their morality in attempt to bring justice to the immoral wrong?   Some cases, however, I can see the thought process... someone who is known to murder victims as many times as the average person eats in a day, if killed themselves, would be sparing one life to potentially save many lives... though I cannot say "innocent" lives, because who is to determine who is or is not innocent?    Whether vigilantism is justified or not is really all dependant on the factors of the vigilant act, as well as the perspective from which their acts are being judged.|`|t8goUrnzaa	aff  criminals can be let free even if it is obvious that they are guilty because of a technicality  it can scare future wrong doers    neg  ppl can go to the extremes and kill ppl for shoplifting  ppl can be wrongly punished.

dNSvlc6caa	I can't think of any because any sound argument should be cogent.  In a sound argument, the conclusion must follow from the premises - which makes it valid, and all the premises must be true.  So true and valid equals sound.  I can't think of any sound argument that is not cogent.      Example of a valid but unsound argument (premises aren't true):    All plants are purple.  All trees are plants.  Therefore, all trees are purple.    Example of an invalid argument with true premises:    All cats are mammals  All people are mammals.  Therefore, I (a person) am a mammal    Example of sound argument (valid and true):    No felons are eligible voters.  Some professional athletes are felons.  Therefore, some professional athletes are not eligible voters.
CFE4F3eUaa	Start by writing down words and phrases in the general theme you want. They don't have to be any good or match up at all at first. If you see a pattern forming, start cutting out stuff that doesn't fit, and adding stuff that does. Keep rewording and rearranging to get something that says exactly what you mean, but is also flowing. It doesn't have to rhyme or have a specific structure, but it should be honest. The strongest writing is based in truth. Write the truth over something made up that just sounds good.

vmmMqhxXaa	I read this book some 35 years ago, so I had to look up the summary:  see the first source below.  Then I had to make sure my memory served on how to write a sonnet:  That's the second source.    I remember that this book impressed me deeply.  The idea of such total forgiveness, I must admit, is way beyond me.  I couldn't do that, and am not sure I'd want to.  But it's admirable.    Here's my attempt:    The stench of death hangs low like dirty sheets.  My sister Betsie struggles just to breathe.  My hands clench by my sides as anger meets  With raw despair.  My mind and spirit seethe.    Bunks too narrow, blankets far too thin,  Remind me of a narrow hiding place  So far away in Haarlem, where those frightened men  And women crouched inside that covert place.    I cannot see the future, cannot see  That three years hence, a guard from this hellhole  Will beg forgiveness in humility,  And granting it will save my own frail soul.    For now, I simply do not understand  How Betsie can leave vengeance in Gods hand.
VOZWgWgLaa	The Battle of Antietam was the result of Lee's first invasion of the North. He intended to advance possibly as far north as Harrisburg, Penn, and began with sending Stonewall Jackson to seize Harper's Ferry on the Virginia, Maryland border. What followed was the intelligence coup of the war, in which Union troops find three cigars wrapped in paper, containing Lee's plans. They deliver them to the Union commander, General McClellan, who promptly does nothing.    When McClellan finally moves, he sends the Union army to converge with the Confederates at Sharpsburg, Maryland near Antietam Creek. McClellan refuses to attack when he arrives and allows Lee to fortify his positions. What followed the next day was the bloodiest single day in American History.    Union General Joe Hooker is sent to attack Stonewall Jackson through a massive cornfield overlooking a Dunker Church. Jackson's lines waiver, but hold.     McClellan then orders an attack on the Confederate center, in which southern riflemen, under John Gordon take cover in a sunken wagon road. They hold off repeated Union charges until Union troops find a spot where they can shoot down on the rebels. Gordon's lines are shattered, but McClellan decides not to attack again and break the entire Confederate line. The battle here is remembered as "Bloody Lane".     The final part of the battle occured in the south where General Burnside attempted to cross the creek via an old bridge, now called "Burnside Bridge". The bridge, however, was narrow and several outnumbered Confederate sharpshooters hold off Union charges long enough for AP Hill to arrive and force Union troops, after finally advancing beyond the bridge, to retreat back to the bridge itself.    Lee began withdrawing the next day, and it was considered a "moral victory" for the North, as it prompted Lincoln to issue the emancipation proclaimation.|`|NAHDcvcFaa	determined to build upon the confederate victory at second bull run, robert e lee invaded the north though western maryland only to lose a decisive battle during the single bloodiest day of the civil war. combined confederate and union losses totaled more than 27,000 in jsut 12 hours of battle. it was a major turning point in the war and gave lincoln the confidence to enact the emancipation proclamation thereby changing the wars aim from saving the union to pursuing the more lofty goal of human freedom (it was nothing more than a political move) and increasing the union troops to include black soldiers (before this they were outlawed)
hJP9y6kjaa	There are two general methods to finding notes to solo with.    The first is to play to the chord. For each chord, you can pick the notes of the chord (the chord tones) to use in your melody. So if you have a C major chord, you can play the notes from the C major chord - C, E, and G. You can add the seventh, too, usually it's in the form of a flatted seventh (b7). In a C major chord that would be Bb.    The second is to play to the scale. If you know what the key your progression is in you can play an appropriate matching scale. For instance, if your progression is    C - Em - G    Then you would know that the progression is in the key of C major. You can use the notes of the C major scale ( C D E F G A B C ).    One way to take both approaches is to utilize the notes of the chords, but tie them together with notes from the major scale or major pentatonic scale. C major pentatonic is ( C D E G A ).    You have to match up the right scale to the progression. The C minor scale is ( C D Eb F G Ab Bb C ), so you can see how the notes won't match up, right? You don't want to play Eb over E, it won't sound right.      Mustaine, etc use a variety of scales. Iommi probably uses the blues scale (minor pentatonic with an added b5) more, Mustaine probably uses the harmonic and melodic minor scales more. Not sure about Friedman.        Saul|`|FViagGVEaa	That's the very basic idea, but i doubt any of them use scales as simple as Major/Minor scales for solo's.  They probably use some really advanced scales  I personally use Pentatonic's, Arpeggio's and Harmonic Minors, and occasionally blues scales  If they do use Majors its likely Harmonic Minor scales (Take a major scale and flat the 3rd and 6th notes)|`|r9s0VyJgaa	Lets say your chord progression uses the C, F and G chords (the I, IV and V chords in the key of C).     In that case, a C major chord is made up of the following notes: C E G.    The F chord is made up of the following notes: F A C.     And the G chord is made up of the following notes: G B D.    Then when the C major chord is playing, you would want to emphasize the C, E and G notes by playing them on the accented downbeats.  You can use the other notes in the C major scale as passing notes (for example, to go from C to E you could play C D E, or to go from E to G, play E F G).  Or you can start on a chord note, play a neighboring note and then back to a chord note (C B C, for example, or E F E D C.    Whenever the F chord is playing, you would want to emphasize the F, A and C notes by playing them on the accented downbeats.  Again you can use the other notes in the C scale to get from one chord note to another.      And whenever the G chord is playing, you would want to emphasize the G, B and D notes by playing them on the accented downbeats, using other notes in the C scale to get from one chord note to another.    Experiment with using non-chord notes in the scale to move between chord notes and figure out what sounds best.  This is the general concept of how to write melodies to fit chord progressions.    I have no idea what scales the guitarists you mention use -- although I imagine they probably use the minor pentatonic "blues" scale as well.  The blues scale is a pentatonic scale with additional notes:  its the 1, b3, 4 b5, 5, b7 notes of the scale.      In the key of C, this would be: C, Eb, F, Gb, G, Bb, C.      You can create licks and melodic phrases using this scale and they will work over any of the chords - the C major, F major or G major.     Hope this helps.|`|5n6s0vUyaa	The first thing you should do is remember the relative minor, or 6th mode, of the major scales. So in C major the notes are C,D,E,F,G,A,B,C and the 6th mode is A. So starting on A and playing the exact same notes is the relative minor and you can use this idea in soloing. When soloing you generally don't have to think about changing scales when you have a chord change unless you want to emphasize some notes. So if we were playing in the key of C, you would you notes from the A minor pentatonic scale to solo over it. This is probably the way you should learn to solo first. Mustaine uses a lot of minor pentatonic licks in his solos and harmonic minor once in awhile, Friedman uses his own scales which sound really similar to harmonic minor or phrygian, phrygian dominant. Iommi uses a lot of minor pentatonics as well. Just learn the pentatonic scale shapes, major and minor, and learn it well enough to be able to connect them and know which notes are in them. Then start adding your own stuff to it like emphasized notes or certain patterns to it to make them sound better. And the phrygian and harmonic minor scale sound really middle eastern and exotic which is usually what Friedman uses like in Holy wars.

rT22hTL0aa	I think the brand name the store said was probably "Selmer."  I had to check online because I didn't even know that flutes were being made under the Selmer name (Selmer is well known for Saxophones).  As such, I don't know anything about the Selmer flute.  I would recommend a Yamaha or Gemeinhardt - as far as price goes, a used one might just do the trick.|`|dsQdxfSbaa	a good brand that is sutable for your buget gould be     Cecilio 2Series Nickel Plated Flute that you can buy online at:    http://www.kkmusicstore.com/index.php?ma...|`|aNfGqkrpaa	Personally, I say browse fluteowrld.com for flutes.  They only carry trusty brands, and they test each instrument b4 seling it and they adjust them, too.  I'm sure you deffinatly want a flute for less than a thousand, so look at:  Yamaha 221 for 824.00  Gemeinhardt 2SP for 409.00  Jupiter 511RBSO for 599.00  Pearl 505R for 559.00  Trevor James 10X2 for 499.00    In order from best to worst is Yamaha, Trevor James, Pearl, Germeinhardt, then Jupiter.    If you want more than a beggeniers flute check Trevor James, they have inexpensive quality instruments.    PS> all brands listed are on flute world.|`|tM6xoexWaa	Selmer flutes are fine - average everyday flutes.  Yamahas are good instruments, but a little pricey.   Lots of band directors suggest students buy Gemeinhardts but aren't sure why.  Over the years they have proven to hold up under extreme student abuse.  I think you can play baseball with these turkeys and never dent them.  However, to me, the sound is a bit pinched.    I'm not sure how much you want to pay, but I recently bought a Pearl open hole (lower level) as my backup flute when my goody Powell has to go to the doctor.  Pearl was suggested to my by my doctoral flute instructor because he too has a low level open hole pearl for a backup flute.  I paid around $750 for it brand new, but have seen it in the $500s recently on sale.  Every once in awhile I pull my Pearl out for a rehearsal and none of my colleagues have ever noticed a difference between the two flutes (there is a difference to me, but certainly not a $10,000 one).    Anyway, check out Woodwind and Brasswind and find something good.  You can probably get even lower beginner ones for cheaper.    Hope some of this helps.

When clay is heated enough, the ingredients melt, more or less, and vitrify - which means to make glass - holding the unmelted parts together.  Glaze is a formula with a lot less solids than clay and more stuff that will give colors and melt to a smooth glass surface that seals the clay for use and decoration.     I have just been working on an addition to a glass information page and am discussing glazes and their relation to glass, so I have this set of ingredients for a clear high temp glaze  Wide Base-cone 4 to 10  Potash feldspar-40%  Gertsley borate-40%  Ball clay-15%  Flint-10%   The first two melt fairly easy to glass, flint is a form of silicon dioxide which is also sand and in glass would be 70%, not 10%

t3A9qpQIaa	The depression happened in increments.  People who had mortgages lost their homes in two weeks because banks demanded full payment.    As the depression deepened jobs closed just like they are now.  Many were made homeless.  The ones who ate had essential services; that is things you had to have like plumbers, carpenters, mechanics.  My grandfather was a shoemaker.  Their house was paid for.  Many people who were surviving were kind and generous to others.  Giving food to vagabond's and bums.  People helped each other more easily then.  Some were lucky to get into military.  Later FDR started work programs.  My dad had to quit school at 9th grade to support the family because his father became disabled.  He joined the CCC's at 17.  Then the Army.  Then when WW II broke out he joined the Navy and became a signalman on a destroyer.  He could do semaphore, morris code, and shutters.  The make work programs didn't stop the depression.  WWII did.

The only thing he told me about it, with an unusual sense of wonder and horror, was that he saw farmers run over eggs with a bulldozer when people were starving, because no one could afford to drive them to market and no one had money to pay at the market, anyway.      There weren't that factory jobs in the Depression. There were some and they were coveted. People didn't have money to buy things, clothes, or appliances or food even.  Some people did OK.    My mother's mother made her own soap from lye and lard until she died in 1977.  People lived on scraps and refuse.

It has been argued that German anti semitism did play a role in bringing France into the War as several members of the  French cabinet were Jewish. Which made relations between the two countries more hostile leading up to France and the UK declaring war.|`|FOkm8MHxaa	no. that was one of the consequences of WWII    one of the causes was the assasination of the archduke ferdinand in sarajevo.    another cause was militarism.|`|IXVnU0wNaa	no, anti-semitism already existed before WWII and hitler used the jews to blame for the termoil Germany was in, in Mein Kampf he proposed his plans to exterminate all of them, and during WWII he executed the Final Solution which was basically to kill all the Jews    so not really, it was a part of it though|`|AA11502346	No, it did not.  The "tension" after the Treaty of Versailles helped to start WWII; the Holocaust was one of the results of it.|`|IEC0t2c8aa	No    Mass killings of Jews began in July 1941 as the death squads (SD-Einsatzgruppen) that followed the German armies into the Soviet Union began to operate behind the German lines.  Most historians of the Holocaust date the start from 1941 or 1942    I'm not certain there is an exact date for the beginning of the holocaust, but some consider the following to be:     Jan 20, 1942 the Wannsee Conference in Berlin was convened by Reinhard Heydrich, who was second in command of the SS.     At this meeting "final solution to the Jewish prolem" became official. This "solution" was the extermination of 6 million European Jews plus about 5 million other people.    .  The holocaust ended in specific places when the Allies liberated the camps in 1944-1945. The holocaust did not end completely till the end of WWII in Europe and the surrender of all German troops.     The Holocaust ended a few days after Hitler committed suicide because the Germans realized Hitler was dead so they decided to let the Jews go. The year was 1945. However, even when camps were liberated the death rate from disease remained high for several weeks.     The date of September 1, 1939, when Germany invaded Poland, is remembered as the date the war started. But little is remembered about the date Russia also moved into Poland, on September 16,1939. The nation of Poland was now divided between these two war-time allies.    What constitutes a 'world war'? How many countries need to be involved?  And who decides at which point a number of regional skirmishes can be grouped together and called a World War?  World War 2?    A World War is a military conflict spanning more than 2 continents, in which at least 20 major countries participate in an attack against a common enemy, and which has the attention of the man-in-the-street due to the significant loss of life.    With that definition, we can agree  WW2 was in fact a World War (it was  involved some degree of participation from most of the world's then existing countries: Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United States and the Soviet Union).    the scarey thing is the proposed World War three        The Planned World War 3 - A Play in Numerous Acts    World War Three in Brief    A Three World War scenario was developed several decades ago (see Conspiratorial History).  Two World Wars have already been achieved, and the Third and final World War envisions an attack on Iraq, Iran and/or Syria as being the trigger to set the entire Middle East into fiery conflagration. Once America is firmly entrenched into the Middle East with the majority of her first-line units, North Korea is to attack South Korea. Then, with America's forces stretched well beyond the limit, China is to invade Taiwan.  This will usher in the start of World War Three.  With this said , we can  agree that we are very close to achieving World War 3.  The only requirement left to fulfill the start of WW3 is that of a military conflict spanning more than 2 continents.  As soon as Israel attacks Palestine, or North Korea attacks South Korea or the US, or China invades Taiwan, we will have the next World War well underway    pray like you never have   and if you never have start.    mercy    peace    trust

I saw one of the 'Lord of the Rings' movies, and I wouldn't have understood what was going on had I not read the book.  When I saw 'Dr. Zhivago' in the cinema, in the company of family, I was the only one who had read the book. It came to the point where a man was brought into a field hospital with half his face blown away. I knew what was coming, I covered my eyes and said, 'I can't watch this.' The scene was not in the film and my friends looked at me with astonishment.

5JKLgnyeaa	well, why dont you read it  and i better get a best answer for this, i summarizes twi. and they still havent chosen me. i was the only one that did what they wanted.    In New Moon, Bella snuck away to Volterra to save Edward. Now shes grounded for not telling her dad where she was going, or that she was even going.  so now, edward has only cirtain hours that he can come visit Bella(but when Charlies asleep, he comes through the window). They were applying for collages when Bella got off her grounding, for not complaining and obeyinng the rules, when Edward said that now bella could go shopping with bella. charlie said he didnt want bella going to seeatle. thats when edward picked up the paper and saw that there were murders, all at night in seeatle. he told charlie he wouldnt want bella going there either. edward knew that the killers were new born vampires.  they go on worriying about this and Jacob kisses bella, bella hits him and breaks her hand... and the vampires now dispise warewolves, because of what happend in new moon i think it was.. well, they were hunting victoria.. yeah new moon. there was this thing about vamps. goin on wolf turf and yeah.. they hate eachother.  one day when bella got home, she noticed that some of her stuff was missing.  oh yeah and if i didnt say it i think this is the one where edward doesnt want bella seeing jacob so one day when he goes to hunt, and makes alice watch bella, bella gets on a motorcycle w/ jacob and leaves school before alice sees the vision.well doesnt see it. so she doesnt tell edward because she thought that alice threw stuff out or something, but then it turns out that victoria is building a vampire mafia(haha), no like a clan and shes going on a killing spree. and shes after bella, and yeah, shes getting close. so bella hides in the woods(yeah right bella in the woods ha!) and the wolves and vamps. are working together to save bella and they win! and bella made edward stay back from the fight to stay with her in the woods because she doesnt want him to get hurt(and i was like as if you could out run me) so when victoria got bast the wolves and cullens, edward ripped her head off.  bella wants to become a vampire and she wants edward to do it but he'll only do it if she marries him(that was his propasal) and yeah.     its better if you read it, and uhm jacob and bella kiss again before that fight against the newborns.|`|4f277076c7dd369d5ac6ab9f14e344f6aa	Go read it.|`|J8NEZ4V0aa	Basically, Victoria still wants to kill Bella so Bella is scared  Bella is faced with the problem of choosing between her love for Edward and her friendship with Jacob  Bella learns more about Jasper  Victoria creates a band of newborn vampires to kill the Cullens and Bella   Bella, Edward, and Jacob have to say in a tent while this is going on and it snowing so Bella is really cold so Jacob warms her up and Edward gets jealous  Bella kisses Jacob but stays with Edward  The Cullens win against the newborns and Edward kills Victoria  Edward and Bella get engaged in the very end    thats about it hope this helps!!|`|I4LcUEFqaa	bella graduates.. victoria comes back to battle and edward and the werewolfs kill her.. and jacob gets hurt.. and bella and edward get engaged.. thats pretty much all that happens..|`|klPvo7iwaa	sigh twilight again....

Just a heads up: you have lots of spelling and grammar errors, but it was really awesome!   When will you finish the second chapter?  I'm writing a novel, too! Wanna read it? I can send it to you if you want to.|`|2F2rcPchaa	I've never read Twilight, nor do I intend on reading it so I can't make any comparisons as I see others have made. However, to be honest, your plethora of grammar mistakes make the story a chore to drudge through. You are way too generous with your semicolons; you even put them in the wrong place. (see that example?) A semicolon is meant to join two independent clauses that could also exist as separate sentences. A good rule of thumb is if both parts of the sentence that you are dividing could each be an independent sentence, it could possibly work. If it doesn't, then don't put the semicolon there.    Maybe focus on your grammar a little more, then do a rewrite.

Henry Cabot Lodge was against it:    "Senator Lodge argued in [1919] against the League:        The United States is the world's best hope, but if you fetter her in the interests and quarrels of other nations, if you tangle her in the intrigues of Europe, you will destroy her powerful good, and endanger her very existence. Leave her to march freely through the centuries to come, as in the years that have gone. Strong, generous, and confident, she has nobly served mankind. Beware how you trifle with your marvelous inheritance; this great land of ordered liberty. For if we stumble and fall, freedom and civilization everywhere will go down in ruin.[3] "  --Wikipedia

ceBTTCPwaa	The Great Gatsby is a novel by the American author F. Scott Fitzgerald. First published on April 10, 1925, it is set in Long Island's North Shore and New York City during the summer of 1922.    The novel chronicles an era that Fitzgerald himself dubbed the "Jazz Age". Following the shock and chaos of World War I, American society enjoyed unprecedented levels of prosperity during the "roaring" 1920s as the economy soared. At the same time, Prohibition, the ban on the sale and manufacture of alcohol as mandated by the Eighteenth Amendment, made millionaires out of bootleggers and led to an increase in organized crime. Although Fitzgerald, like Nick Carraway in his novel, idolized the riches and glamor of the age, he was uncomfortable with the unrestrained materialism and the lack of morality that went with it.      http://www.bookrags.com/The_Great_Gatsby    http://www.bookrags.com/notes/gat/    http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/gatsby/    http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...    http://www.novelguide.com/thegreatgatsby...    http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?articl...    http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...    http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...    http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...    http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/G...|`|e64131f8dff2e226d6f3c656a811cc6baa	I think you can find the answer by reading this book called the Great Gatsby by F.

GpArrlQZaa	Stacy had just had an argument with Joe. He was an adversary to her in their soccer game coming up. But she didn't want to think about that right now. Now she wanted to think about the game. The chaste, white ball. The exquisite, breath taking field of lush, green grass. It was her favorite thing in the world, the game. Last week, they had to forfeit their game, because 3 of their players failed to show up. Stacy wallowed in her grievance all day. But that was the past. Now all the players were here and everything was falling into place. Her team was competing against "The Strikers" who were quite a pernicious team. Stacy gathered with the rest of the team and they got into position on the field. As soon as the referee blew the piercing whistle, she was off. But just as she was about to shoot the ball into the net, an opposing player kicked the ball from under her, and Stacy fell into a heap on the ground. She thrived in the pain. By now, everyone on the field was surrounding her. Finally her coach came running up, acting as a warrant, to purge the increasing crowd. "Are you okay, Stacy" He asked. "Well, I think I broke my ankle." She told him. Her coach scooped her up and brought her to the sidelines. The coach from the other team and the player who injured her came up and with sincere solemnity and sorrow, apologized. Stacy forgave them. She just hoped that soon her ankle would be healed and she could play again.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Do your own homework.    You do know just how many teachers lurk here, right?|`|daza5A4vaa	Wow..

If your into fiction or vampires I would suggest "Twilight"than "New Moon" then "Eclipse" and "Breaking Dawn". One after the other because they're a series. Everyone is talking about them books.    If your into books with Happy ending etc. Then I would Recommend Jaqueline Wilson Books,Any of them really. Just read the Summary to see what one you'd prefer.    If you like funny books, I would read Louise Renninson's Books. Very funny. You start with Angus Thongs and Full-Frontel Snogging and then there's books after that.

I stared without breathing across the long room, into the dark eyes of the  hunter, and he looked pleasantly back at me.  Surely it was a good way to die, in the place of someone else, someone I loved.  Noble, even. That ought to count for something.  I knew that if I'd never gone to Forks, I wouldn't be facing death now. But,  terrified as I was, I couldn't bring myself to regret the decision. When  life offers you a dream so far beyond any of your expectations, it's not  reasonable to grieve when it comes to an end.  The hunter smiled in a friendly way as he sauntered forward to kill     New Moon- I felt like I was trapped in one of those terrifying nightmares, the one where you have to run, run till your lungs burst, but you cant make your body move fast enough.  Bella Swan, New Moon, Preface, p.1    My own life meant little to me today.  Bella Swan, New Moon, Preface, p.1    As the clock began to toll out the hour, vibrating under the soles of my sluggish feet, I knew I was too lateand I was glad something bloodthirsty waited in the wings. For in failing at this, I forfeited any desire to live.

GClXFKp1aa	Cyprus was destined to play a very important role in the history of mankind. This was bound to be so since the island is located in the centre of the ancient world which is known as the cradle of western civilisation.     Asia Minor is only 40 miles away and the Syrian coast only 60 miles from the easternmost tip of the Karpass Peninsula. Egypt and the Aegean Sea are 240 miles apart. Therefore it was only natural that a great civilisation flowered in Cyprus beginning as early as the 8th millennium BC when stone was the only material used either for weapons or utensils.     The discovery of copper which occurred in the 3rd millennium marked the turning point in the history of the island which gradually turned it into a bone of contention among the more powerful neighbours. The Hittites in Anatolia and Egypt in the south claimed the island as their possession but the Greeks from the west were those who stamped its destiny when in the late 13th -- 12th -- 11th centuries BC they established themselves as permanent settlers. Despite the fact that the island fell prey to all the big powers of the day the presence of Greeks gave Cyprus a historical and cultural continuity ever since

tqg3qZzSaa	France was replacing Spain as the dominant power in Europe, its kings were absolute rulers and for the most part the central government had far more authority over the nobles than in other countries. As you stated France was catholic, after having fought a religious war in the 1500s.    England had a strong navy that was considered one of the best in Europe. Over in America, the British had far more populous and productive colonies than the French. The British were protestant and had a state controlled church where the king was the head.     The fact that there are so many differences between the two countries should make it easier to write your paper. You could just focus on the religions of each country, or the differences in government.|`|gnbBIRu6aa	I love the way you put 1600s in small type.    Okay lets pick a key difference, religion, by the beginning of the 17th century England was firmly protestant. This wasn't some abstract theological issue it affected the very nature of the country. It split them from the continent, so now they were separated geographically and philosophically from Europe. The majority of Europe was catholic apart from some german and swiss states and the Nordic countries.    France was firmly Catholic, its Huguenot protestant minority were effectively marginalized by the beginning of the 17th century and by the century's end most of them would have fled to england or its colonies.|`|AA10234026	There were an infinite number of differences as there have been in any century.

On the other hand, the English benefited from what were fairly forward thinking ideas for those times such as the Bill of Rights and Habeus Corpus. There was also the obvious difference in the law courts which exists to this day that under English law you are innocent until proven guilty whereas under French law you are guilty until proven innocent.    For your essay you should cover the differences in religion and how the church interacted with the politcal leaders (seperation of church and state), legal rights (Bill of Rights, Star Chamber, Habeus Corpus), the English Parliament and its relationship with the King compared to the French King and aristocracy.|`|IKCxj9gHaa	the 1600's were a time of massive upheavals for both countries, for England it was more political than religious while the opposite was true for france, in England in 1601 the english queen Elizabeth 1st died childless, this meant that the next in line for the english throne was her cousin James, the problem was he was James 6th king of scotland from the house of stuart, which was then a wholly separate country to England, when he was crowned king of England it signalled the union of scotland and england under one king (a scottish one) this gave birth to the nation of Great Britain, this did not go down well with many in England and a number of plots were hatched the most famous of which was the gun power plot, (a plan to kill James and then kill every scots person in London. James survived all these plots and when he died the throne past to his son Charles 1st, he believed in the Divine right of kings and attempted to rule without Parliament, this lead to civil war and the execution of the king (also lead to war between england and scotland and ireland), england then spent 10 years under a military dictatorship were all religions except Catholics were allowed this gave birth to religions such as Quakers and Baptist among many others. after 10 years the dictator (Oliver Cromwell) died and Charles 1st son (Charles 2nd) was asked to return from excile and take back the throne. He did and became a much loved king it was he who commisioned christopher wren to re-build after the great fire of london leading to such places as St Paul Catherderal.    When Charles died the throne went to his brother James, he was a Catholic and to many it appeared it was trying to sneak back the old religon, the people of england did not want an other civil war so they asked the prodastant William of Orange (Holland) to come over with an army and remove James from the throne, which he could then have as long as he agreed to abide with the english democratic system. he agreed and arrived in England at the head of a small dutch army, James feld to the only catholic country in the home islands which was ireland, there he raised an army, the two kings met at the battle of the boyne, and james was defeated fleeing into excile in france, he was the last of the house of stuart to reign but his son and grandson were to return to scotland twice during the 1700's to lead revolts against the new kings.  In france they enjoyed an uninterupted line of kings but spent much of the century either in religous civil war or fighting other european countries i.e the thirty years wars. the problem was while france was a catholic country it had a very large minority protestant community, this lead to attempts on the kings life by prodestant nobles, seiges and wholesale killings on both sides, the most famous of which is the st valentines day massacare when thousands of protestants were dragged from their homes in paris one morning and put to death by catholic mobs on the streets.     while this was genocide it did serve a purpose with the murder of so many of the protestant leaders the civil war ended, the protestants leaderless and vunerable fled in massive numbers (several hundred thousand) to the only place they could be safe - England, this was one of the first great waves of immigrants to hit England in centuries, it was a massive boost to England as many of these people were the leaders in various fields of philosphey and science who set up home in England     as you can see the 1600's were difficult times for both countries but for different reasons.

2PDBxlYDaa	I knew one girl who got a bunch of fashion magazines like Vogue and whatnot, then traced over them. Once you are done tracing, add your own unique details. Don't make it look like you traced it. That girl got herself into art college, once you are accepted you take all sorts of beginner art classes. They teach you everything you will need to know.
g8kIjpwSaa	More often than not, employers won't really care what kind of college you go to, but if there was a totem pole of impressive school, anything with the words "art institute" in the name, followed by anything with the word "State" in it, with anything including the word "university" in it, and rounding out last would be "(insert name here) Community College".    Don't be worried. Employers hire people from all over the country and sometime beyond. Chances are, unless they spend all their free time studying U.S. Collegiate Directories, they probably will not have heard of most peoples schools school unless it's a major State University in their own state.    Long story short, your portfolio is what's important. I'll tell you that I went to an accredited design college and 90% of what I know, I taught myself....so school isn't everything. If you have a good portfolio they will either think one of two things. (A) Wow, you went to a really good school....or (B) Wow, you must be really talented to have this great of a portfolio from a state college education.    Concentrate on making you portfolio strong. Good Luck!!!!!!|`|e91746f2ef52a840fd7d7a17333e103baa	I think that what is important is to choose a college or university that is known for it's strengths in illustration and graphic design. Some colleges have great art departments that excel in painting, sculpture and printmaking but not in graphic design. Especially consider the reputation of the professors at the school, and if they are recognized for their own work. You can find excellent people at non-Ivy League schools. Once you get into the program of your choice, be sure to work very hard and get to know your professors. They will be able to recommend you when jobs and internships come up. The student-mentor relationship is an important one that can open doors for years to come, besides serving as a source of information you can trust.

346683d356126a2c7bdb62721d918419aa	The Good:    To be an American to me means that we are free and are so fortunate to even have many of things that we actually have.    We are fortunate to have a government 'that's' supposed to look out for the peace, safety and enjoyment of life for every one of us,     Being an American is awesome because we have a society that is willing to help people who are less fortunate.    Being an American I can communicate with other cultures and we can learn from each other.    Being an American we have the constitutional right to worship God [or not] in our own faith and religion without fear of persecution.    To be able to strive for the American dream through education and hard work. And through capitalism and entrepenaurship we can achieve our goals.    Being an American like no other country in the world is the 'Right To Free Speech' about different ideas and causes without fear of retribution.      The Bad:    Allowing the U.S. government to  become greedy and too powerful over Americans.    Being an American is to be frustrated on the decline of the morality in this great country.    Being an American at this time is not feeling secure about our national security and safety.    The unbelievable national debt that under this 'stimulus' package experts say will not work creating more debt, distrust in the American dollar and commerce in the world.    Being an American is seeing a once great country governed by wisdom now seemingly turning into a zombie like nation where the innocent pay and the guilty run free in our corrupted judicial system!  ______________________________________...

You just count 16 of those sections and presto! 16 measures!|`|o79pcjrpaa	I'm in band and I know how to read music, but song music might be different, but it could be the same... Idk!    It's kinda hard to explain...  Just count the value of each note and once the beats add up to 4 counts that's one measure, so you kinda just count to four sixteen times...  For example, if you have a half note and two quarter notes, that adds up to 4 beats so it's one measure...    That doesn't really make sense, but maybe it helps.
0l98mcf3aa	If travelling backwards had always been the case, if it was the norm, then everyone would accept that motion as moving 'forwards' because they'd be heading in the direction they intended to go. So if someone moved in the opposite way, it would, to them, seem 'backwards'.|`|Xwy9ac34aa	yes|`|7xmr5R6qaa	Perhaps.|`|xitShEqDaa	if i were moving forward??|`|x6bbhRcHaa	as you would be part of the equation,you may think that you would appear to be going backwards,but as we are all together,we would appear stationary|`|YmwzubmFaa	If everyone was walking backward but you were the only one walking forward then everyone going backwards would be like "wtf is up with her/him walking like that".|`|s4zxGI4naa	yes, like going back in time.....?|`|P9xcHXryaa	wait what?!

Depending on your perspective of re-incarnation or the after-life it could be possible for true love to last, literally, forever.   Some beliefs suggest that said statement is not only possible but indeed holds true in many cases. Some say that the spirits of two people are connected and have such a strong bond that they re-incarnate together as different people but remain a part of each other's lives each time they re-incarnate, thus creating "Soul mates"   Seeming no one has undeniable evidence of the existance or non-existance of this particular belief in re-incarnation... it is something mankind may ponder generation after generation unless proof is somehow revealed for or against the belief that souls re-incarnate and often times have soul mates that they are "destined" to be with for all eternity.|`|YmtNel5haa	what is your definition of true love?  I have some doubts about it lasting past death, but it is a nice thought.|`|w6DJj1a8aa	i think true love does last forever yes we die and all but we pass it down to our kids i think because the love that my grandparents had for each other they passed it down to me and now i have that love that they gave me to give to my kids and my future soulmate i honestly believe that it last forever|`|AA11635601	Like a tree, there is no inherent lifespan on love.  It lives and grows forever until something external disrupts it, such as death of one of the people or, more commonly, collision with someone's deeper denials or delusions.  But it does not wither with age or collapse under its own weight; unimpeded, it grows and grows and grows.|`|OqlXBUsaaa	of course.  it may have some detours or lapses.and if it does not long, then it  will probably turn to its opposite, hate.  true to its laws and definitions, it is.|`|uDuwc7Yoaa	True love does.

Life is a series of balances, and to truly appreciate happiness you must experience sadness.  One can not exist with the other.|`|wz8gx3gaaa	Rather it is a best thing to happen.|`|I6D7xdcVaa	It is wrong, to not be happy all the time.|`|OL2aENUVaa	No. In fact many eastern religions (Hinduism, buddhism) focuses on happiness. Whether its Buddhist Nirvana or Hindu Moksha, it's about enlightenment and selflessness and love.|`|AA11488628	not wrong but annoying and not human. we are supposed to be able to feel more than one emotion that is why there is so many and so many combinations. so someone who is happy ALL the time is most likely crazy. sadness is natural as is anger.|`|jeGDvHWaaa	NO!!! if you have found happiness then hold on to it. People spend their whole lives searching for happiness.|`|PElAxLUdaa	I don't think it's wrong but one could argue it isn't human|`|pqOLekE7aa	I don't think its wrong. I mean...i have been very depressed recently. But now that i have gotten things figured out i am happy a lot of the time. Some moments i flash back to stuff that upsets me...but thats getting of the subject. I don't think there is anything wrong with being happy all the time!

EVhoTkyzaa	YES!  I like your poem very much.  I like the fourth line in the second stanza "But tears show the humans and non humans apart", how true that really is.  If you're still human then you still have a sense of reality and you haven't become so calloused or vain that you're only concerned with yourself.    The only change I would suggest is changing the word "week" to an alternate spelling "weak" 5th line 2nd stanza and I would suggest posting on allpoetry.com  to get a healthy criticism of your writing.  Good Job!|`|D018CPTUaa	sucks|`|VAjird8Gaa	I really liked this poem, it was a very ggod topic and you stayed with it really well :D|`|J4lfOSPiaa	I loved it and I like your moxie for putting it out there to be critiqued by professional writers and amateurs as well. You are expressing a deeply intimate moment of vulnerability that many people can relate to but are afraid to share.  Your sagacity and depth of emotion are dangling right out there and I applaud you for your daring interpretation of human emotion that some people pay huge dollars on a psychiatrist to learn how to express exactly a feeling like this. The sentiment was so beautiful it made a tear fall down my cheek, and I am not blowing smoke in your face.  Keep writing your poems and someday we may see them for sale at the local book store.  Thank you for the tender touch!  It will be poets and writers like you who remind us of our humanity.|`|dL0A7hMhaa	Good effort.    In your 3rd last line, you spelled "weak" wrong. You set up a rhyming scheme for your poem, so I think you should use it throughout and not leave out the rhymes in some lines- it would give it a better rhythm and structure.|`|776cf4cc9dc31fae3b35bd08e9ead34eaa	Wow I really like it, and I'm not a huge poetry fan. It has some really touching and honest moments.
TlLA1DVoaa	"Visions blurry" should be "vision is blurry" or "vision's blurry".    The "I" in "everyone I know" limits the poem to your personal experience. If you want the poem to have a broader, more global tone, rearrange that line so the word "I" isn't in it.    Also, your audience changes, which is confusing. In lines 1, 3, and 6-8, you address the world as "we", but right in the middle of line 4 there's these random "you"s. Changing them to "we"s would unify the poem.    Some punctuation might be nice, too. Maybe a period on line 5, or a colon ( ":") at the end of line 6. Your choice, since you're the poet.     Other than these, I like it! Keep up the good work!|`|nWoESULQaa	Its a good poem.  But i dont like the last line "we must open our eyes and take in the world as if weve never seen it before" the poem  keeps rhyming but then it suddently stops i dont know how to imporve i though. but you should change the last line

heF3HIzQaa	Well the word superpower only dates from 1945, so that is ONE answer.    It was clear it was becoming a great power since the end of the ACW in 1865. That created the United States as one entity. Before the ACW people would say 'The United States are...'. After it was 'The United States is..." The difference is one vs many. From that point it was obvious the USA was a great power. Their entry into WW1 tipped the balance for the allies and by the post WW1 period its navy could rival that of Britain.    But actual superpower status - and the very word superpower - had to wait for the end of WW2 and the invention of the atom bomb - both in 1945.|`|AA10234026	At the tie of the Monroe Doctrine we thought we were a great power even though we did not at the time have the sea power to back up the Doctrine.|`|aHmAZeoqaa	When the US dropped Hiroshima in 1 hit.

Subject matter includes rape and adultery.  Broader themes are family relationships, lies, and self-deception.  It's not ponderous or moralistic, though.  A good, fast-paced story with strong characters, including the father who is writing a graphic novel based on Dante's "Inferno."

mrI8mfFpaa	I DONT THINK SO...  MAYBE IT WAS "KARMA"...  WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THOSE BRITISH COLONIAL CRIMES AROUND THE WORLD...|`|gnbBIRu6aa	It wasn't a single bomber it was an entire bomber wing over 80 planes. The RAF entered the war with a large bomber force. The RAF saw the bomber as a strategic weapon ie one that could conceivably win the war by itself.    The luftwaffe was a tactical air force relativly small fighters and bomber designed to fight in support of the army which would win the war.    During the invasion of Holland the Luftwaffe firebombed Rotterdam in order to force the Dutch to surrender. Hitler gave explicit orders not to do this in the UK,  most likely because he was  fearful of a disproportionate British response. The RAF up untill this stage had restricted bomber command in its choice of targets. They dropped leafelets and attacked shipping but with limited effect.     This was the subject of much criticism within the RAF and pressure was mounting to change it, also they needed to take pressure of fighter command while the Battle of Britain was raging.    In august 1940 bombs were dropped on the outskirts of London this was most likely an accident. This was the pretext bomber command needed on the 25th August an RAF bomber raid attempted to bomb industrial targets in Berlin they couldn't identify their targets so they  bombed the city instead, this was most likely intentional as it was always unlikely the bombers would find their targets. The same month Hitler ordered the Blitz which diverted bombers away from the RAF airfields which was arguably Bomber Commands intention in attacking Berlin.|`|AA10234026	Such a British bomber run would be incidental to the big picture.|`|OFA2LAM5aa	It was actually a lost German bomber formation that accidentally dropped their bombs on London that started the bombing of cities.    On the evening of August 24th, 1940 a German Bomber formation accidentally bombed some non-military targets in London. Winston Churchill immediately ordered reprisal attacks on non military German targets in Berlin. This prompted a furious response from Hitler, who ordered that a blitz campaign of bombing start immediately on London. This began on September 7th, when a massive 330 tons of bombs were dropped on London.    http://ehistory.osu.edu/wwii/timeline.cf...|`|AA11304025	no. That story is ridiculous

CivfnBR4aa	Well to start, if your in high school, take the drama classes that your school offers.  These classes will teach you theatre techniques and help to polish your talent.  Also, be sure to tryout for the school plays and musicals. This will not only strengthen you as actress, but it will strengthen your craft.  Check to see if you have any local theaters in your city, if you do, go and see what productions are coming up and audition for roles.  Community Theatre is by far the best thing you can do to become an actress.      Do research on good theatre schools such as North Carolina School of the Arts.  See if they have summer programs where you can go and take your talent to the next level.      A lot of people think that if your going to become an actress, then you don't need to go to college.  THAT IS NOT TRUE AT ALL!!!!.  In fact going to college for it will put you heads and shoulders above everybody else.  Really good theatre schools set up auditions with agents in L.A., Chicago, and New York for their senior class.  Many of these actors have become very successful.      Becoming an actress is very difficult, but not impossible. Whatever you do, don't give up. No matter what anybody tells you.|`|4qVXodtnaa	Take part in local theatre/school plays (if relevant)/pantomimes - you may be spotted by a talent agent, who will help to get you auditions for things like movies, but you have to be really, really, really good!    If you aren't spotted, once you have LOADS of experience, you send off your headshots and resume/CV to several agencies. Some may request an interview with you, if you ace the interview and get signed, then you have made a big step.    The road to becoming an actress is a long, difficult one - but it reaps fantastic rewards!|`|ogKejBpEaa	Theres a number of things you can do. Like be in Barbrizon, audition for an soap opera, be in theater. I have the same goal as you. I would do a resume, get a headshot taken of yourself, and send the resume to casting directors if I were you.     Here is a good website to help you get started on a resume...  http://www.kidzworld.com/article/3656-ge...
