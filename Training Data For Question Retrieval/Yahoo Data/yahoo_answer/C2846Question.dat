I was on my way to the airport and decided to stop in at the Wall Street Burger Shoppe for lunch before I head to London. I just wanted a burger and since I never look at the price as I am very wealthy I ordered a burger and they billed me 175 dollars it was by far the best burger I have ever had though.

20090309164442AAknjUo	Dining Out;Canada;Vancouver	Alternative restaurant for Cactus Club?	I have about 40-45 people attending, and reservations are very hard. I just love the atmosphere though, the dim lights, makes it okay to wear fancy dresses. Whereas I do it at White spot or Pizza hut, it'll be weird, since I'm celebrating my 18th.. I don't know any other good ones, plus I did make a reservation, but its four people per seat AND 18% tax included, which might be a little too much for me...      I don't want Milestones because my friends and I have been there a couple of times. Is joey grill good? moxie's? I'm talking about quality and atmosphere, will it be okay to wear dresses there?      Thanks!
