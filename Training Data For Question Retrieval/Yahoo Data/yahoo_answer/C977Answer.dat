But we all know it would be AJ Styles which could revive the Cruiserweight Division but we all know that WWE and Vince Mcmahon doesn't push smaller guys it would be a waste of time and talent for Styles. You could inject Sting on either RAW or SD and watch him win the WHC or WWE championship easily
czNUMFdWaa	As a High School Coach myself, I see this type of transition pretty regularly.  The jump from a Tornado to a Virtual Gravity is pretty dramatic and possibly unnecessary, but to be sure, I would take the following into consideration.    If you are (or have the potential) above 180, I would consider the higher performance balls like the VG and Hammers but if you are below 180, the Playmaker is a pretty good bang for the buck.      Just about anything you buy is going to react better than the Tornado which is an entry-level reactive resin ball with a very mild surface.  Based on the info in your question, you would want to go with a more aggressive surface, mid RG (2.5-2.9) ball.     I would say the Hammer Bite would be a nice choice.  The VG is an awesome ball but probably too aggressive.  I had a few of my guys switch to the Cell Pearl which is a great medium oil ball.    There are so many choices out there and many of them are good.  The most important thing is that you go to a good pro shop that will work with you to make the right decision.    Best of Luck!|`|FaAdpQypaa	Well, I've bowled with both. My bite i can get a nice clean line to the pocket and it hits like a feight train. My virtual reads the lanes like crazy and if i get it wrong, will recover on the midlane. I shot a 255 with my virtual gravity today at a tournament. So, I'd get the virt grav but from a tornado to a virt is a HUGE difference. You're choice the bite and virt are both EXCELLENT choices.

dhZlRYURaa	Since you bought a spyder, you're probably going to want to play speedball instead of woodsball. The number one most vital speedball upgrade is a dropfoward. After that, make sure you have a decent barrel, and make sure you have a decent tank and hopper.|`|CbAFShuoaa	you can get a lot. hi flow intake, headers, and exhaust, ecu, intercooler, fuel rail and injectors, the list goes on. body upgrades? those are up to you. i recomend a rear wing though for more downforce.
yTTGssXRaa	I had the same problem using Nikes. I went to a running shoe specialty store. They actually had a treadmill in the store and other technology to analyze my foot and running style. They recommended ASICS Gel based on the fact that the shoe is made for runners with high arches in their feet while Nike had minimal arch support. They have been terrific, no pain since. But I would recommend going to a specialty store. All of the testing is free and they will determine the type of foot you have and your running style and recommend shoes that are best suited for you. You might pay a little more for the shoe at the store but you can always buy the same shoe somewhere else with your future purchases. If you already know you have high arches than the Asics gel is a perfect fit.|`|eDCyle05aa	Definitely go with the Asics, you should also check out Brooks running shoes they are really great. Here is a great website, you should check out Asics and Brooks on it (they are usually cheaper!) : http://www.holabirdsports.com/m/Running/...|`|OHs8yJiOaa	You really have to go try them on firsthand.    The Under Armour running shoe line just came out at the end of January, so you're not going to find many, if any, people who are terribly familiar with them. You really can't buy running shoes just based on brand though, regardless. Your foot, arch, pronation, etc. are all different from everyone else, and individual brands and even models will vary a lot from one year to the next.    For what it's worth, early reviews of the Under Armour running shoes in general are indicating (1) that they tend to lack forefoot cushioning, but are otherwise comfortable and (2) that they're made from a unisex last, so it's even more important than usual for women to try them on firsthand to ensure they fit correctly.    If those are absolutely your only two choices and you can't try them on and have to buy blindly, the Asics are likely a safer bet. Asics do tend to run a little narrower, though, and aren't for everyone, so it would be a really really really good idea to actually go to a running store and try things on.|`|QPKgc1xJaa	ASICS? Women's Gel-Stratus 2.1|`|ybTgq7eAaa	i don't even need to look and I know the Asics are way better. i would never trust UnderArmour to make good running shoes, whereas that is what Asics is all about.|`|cKXZOLJSaa	Asics are way better, I own those actually in blue and they're much better. underarmor is only good for clothing, not for running shoes.|`|91DZlqR5aa	It really depends on how high you arch is and some other things. I personally hate asics but some people love them. I don't know about the under armour shoes but I would never buy a pair of under armour shows. I would suggest going to a running show store and trying on a buch of shoes and seeing the ones you like, but out of those two shoes I'd go with the asics.

Compare this to the millions possibly Billions of Dollars in 'donations' by the anti-hunting and tree hugging ideologists. the main difference is that the tax from sportsmen go to the land and land management and the anti-hunting and tree huggers go to pay salaries of executives like PETA presidents, lawyers and court fees. About the only money donated by them that get anywhere near animals is paying for signs to be hung on animal shelters used to house domestic pets before they are sold or killed.  SO the tax on sportsman is a GOOD thing....paying lawyers to fight sportsmen is a BAD thing, unless you are ignorant and want to have a sign with your name on it hung in a Domestic pets Slaughter house.|`|zeXMAsF7aa	it means what it says the some of the taxes we pay on ammo and guns goes to that and the money we spend on liscences goes to the dnr.|`|QrjuueMCaa	I understand that this is more of a statement than a question, and It is a great statement, but is there a question you wanted to ask?

Not to mention that many hunters belong to a group, whether it's Duck's Unlimited, Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, or any one of a million others.  Wildlife is our heritage and passion and we will do everything in our power to make sure it's there to share with our children, and for them to share with theirs.  If it weren't for hunters, our wildlife and wild areas would be in dire straights.  Next time you see a hunter, thank him for all he's done to preserve the wildlife we all enjoy.|`|dfBwVxXFaa	Brett C....... THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL!!!!|`|eo3EHDVIaa	It refers to the Pittman-Robertson tax. That money is one of, if not the biggest, source of funds for habitat preservation.    Hunting also adds to local economies just as any type of tourisim does. Then there is the car insurance savings. Here in NJ the towns that banned hunting generally have higher insurance rates because of the deer car collisions. There is also the health savings. Studies show that those that eat a substantial amount of wild game are healthier than average and even healthier than vegans.    Hunting also eases the suffering of wildlife. Hunting here in NJ has dropped off some in the last few years and the number of dead deer along stream banks has gone up twenty fold. Overpopulation results in disease culling the herd. A bullet is less pain full than being driven to water by thirst but unable to drink.|`|aDNdND6oaa	a portion of the tax set on ammo, weapons, and licenses automatically goes to preserve the habitat for a healthy population of many game and non-game species.    If you want to ensure the existence of anything, let us hunt it, we will provide the habitat.|`|GGDPbT8taa	The taxes on firearms and ammunition have been used towards land conservation, either by buying the property or maintaining it.  Hunters want as much natural land as possible for their sport.  Teddy Roosevelt was an avid hunter and started the first national parks.  Hunting is not just about killing animals it is also about maintaining habitat to ensure game will be healthy in the future.|`|bh82G6zkaa	I like you Kayla

You have not learned what it means to be part of a team - it's better to lose with a united team than win with a patchwork of players seeking their own agenda.|`|9cub6mMQaa	Being a former high school coach, I'd sit you the entire game unless you had a good reason for missing practice. It means nothing that you're the best player or the leading scorer. You missed practice. I actually had a kid scoring 30 points a game that skipped practice thinking he'd be allowed to play - no way. It's not about winning or losing - it's about commitment. Losers don't commit; I don't care how many points you score.

QQyWUDI8aa	well i reameber     Kane began feuding with Triple H, leading to a match at No Mercy on October 20 in which both Kane's Intercontinental Championship and Triple H's World Heavyweight Championship were at stake. In the weeks preceding the match, Triple H claimed that, several years earlier, Kane had an unrequited relationship with a woman named Katie Vick. He went on to claim that, after Vick was killed in a car crash, Kane (the driver) raped her corpse. Triple H later threatened to show video footage of Kane committing the act in question; however, the footage that finally aired showed Triple H dressed as Kane, making sexual remarks then simulating necrophilia with a mannequin in a closed casket (Which the act was immediately cut from broadcast); Kane's tag team partner The Hurricane responded the following week by showing a video of Triple H (rather, someone wearing a Triple H series of masks) getting an enema. The angle was very unpopular with fans, and was de-emphasised before the title match.

You would polly have to be able to get over with the fans. Most likely, you will have to win the mid carder belts before you win the WWE belt.     Or if you become a heel and people really dislike you; then maybe you could get a title shot and win the title as a heel. Therefore, your character would have to somehow appeal to the fans in order for them to see you as a title contender.     My assumption though is that you would have to win the mid carder belts (heel or face) before you win the main belt.     This is only my opinion; I may be wrong in regards to some of the stuff I said though.|`|pg5AHNcdaa	no u cant|`|26fb51ead612e7006829de7144c65343aa	Rey was shorter than you and he made World champ Be4, but he was a high fligher not that much Muscle ya know??? if you do make it in the WWE i guess the only way you'd be able to hold a world title is if you became really really popular because almost every single world champion is like lets say around 6'4 on average and weighs about 200 or more lbs.|`|RPdsRqM2aa	You can do anything you want do if your willing to work hard and pay your dues ,good luck on what ever you decide.

90ZaNZE4aa	My team was the defending Super Bowl Champion.    Due a key injury on Brandon Jacobs, our team slowed down. However the real problem came, when the THAT SELFISH, ARROGANT, IMBECILE, COST US A REPEAT IN THE SUPER BOWL, MORON, IDIOT, LOSER, DUMB $$$,  our number 1 WR Plaxico Buress shot himself in the leg.     We were out of a real WR. I will tell you why it hurt us so much.    Plaxico helped bring the double coverage, that left the front line a lot open. Our running backs were able to have open gaps to run in. And when they covered the rbs, plaxico was wide open and Eli just threw it to him for a TD.    When he was gone, all that gone, and our RBs didnt have that open coverage. Plus when your QB loses his star WR, and he is not the same. Eli had trouble with other receivers as they were not the same caliber as Plax.    Also our OC kevin Gilbride is a moron, who can't call decent plays. For example in the playoffs, he abandoned the run game and made Eli threw in the wind, knowing that Eli was totally sucking that today and our running game was doing really well.    Edit  btw are you a guy or girl? lol im sorry, i just never could figure that out  Edit  lol thats kool bro. Kendall is an unisex name, so i wasn't sure. Sorry brothaaaaaaaaaaaaa|`|eIOlBzm8aa	Merriman and LT got injured. Hart,Wilhelm and Olshansky suck and Merriman not being there exposed them.

The defense, which is going to a blitzing 3-4, will take some time to develop, but will be more entertaining than the 4-3 stand around defense of the past.     Favre is a drama queen. I hope Jets fans have fun with his bullshit retirement drama.|`|KTp27Fokaa	The Broncos did bad because they didn't have a defense and were inconsistent on offense. Too many turnovers.    If you saw the final game of the season against the Chargers, you should understand.|`|ZWkX43zMaa	Well it was all because of our secondary that we went 8-8. We were leading in 7 games that came down to the final 2 minutes, but our secondary gave up too many big plays, which cost us 6 of those games. If we had a solid secondary, then we could have wen 14-2. It will all change now since Gregg Williams is our defensive coordinator. He will get the WHOLE defense in good playing shape and will hopefully improve their abilities. Also, we have the offseason to revamp our defense.|`|6iuZEUhzaa	jets-favre manjini succkk pusssssssssy|`|H1VIZsutaa	The Chiefs need a new offensive coordinator and some linemen!|`|rM9WzIkHaa	eagles  my team didn't do good in the beginning as always, they seem to do the opposite of the other teams and lose but win there last half of the season.  also it seems like win the game is on the line and they get the lead they always seem to give it up in the final 30 seconds. I mean they have the 3rd best defense but it seems like a mediocer defense in the final minutes.      and the 49ers lets see  its just there coaching once they got singletary it all turned around i was really hoping they would beat the cards in their last meeting.... it was close. i think they need to get a better defense, i would not be surprised if they make the playoffs this year.    yeah i know this isnt a winnig answer but thats my theory|`|rjuqrHK7aa	Bengals:  They did not do well because they had offensive line problems. LT Levi Jones was injured half the season and rookie Anthony Collins filled in for the second half of the season and played well. LG whitworth also was injured. We had a all rookie left side of the line part of the year. We have one of the smallest centers in football.     Carson Palmer only played in 4 games. That is a huge problem. In the games he played we almost beat the Giants and Cowboys. Chad Johnson torn his labrum. Thats something in the sholder and what receiver in good with a tore up sholder. That injury happened in the preseason.     The defense finished ranked 12. First round pick Keith Rivers had his jaw broke and had to miss much the second half of the year after being great the first half. The defense problem is the pass rush. They did not get much pressure on the QB at all. These are the main reasons we did not do well in 2008.|`|exOOXAkBaa	We did not have Shawne Merriman. His leadership and talent are the elements that our defense lacked. With Merirman, an opposing offense has to deviate from their offensive gameplan. Merriman, you can make the case, is more valuable than ,say, Peyton Manning or Tom Brady. Plus, he didn't know he used steroids. It's amazing what one player could do for your team. And he is a complete player too.|`|yg3Pveakaa	Patriots..    1. Tom Brady went to IR.  2. Other key members on got injured namely: AD Thomas, Rodney Harrison, L. Maroney, Pierre Woods and others.  3.

We can kinda run. Pierre thomas is pretty good. He is liek lat years Ryan Grant who came alive late in teh season. But yea our d is worthless.    2/4 of the secondary are legit second string guys  1/4 is just worthless  Jason David and Randell Gay are ok behind teh scence guys.|`|E3wAsSjUaa	My team: NE Pats.    1. The secondary was pretty much nonexistent. Game after game they got burnt by the deep ball. They just couldn't stop anybody.    2. Red zone defense. I believe they came in dead last in that category. They played significantly better after the nightmarish loss to Pittsburgh, but still was just horrendous throughout the season.     3. Dumb penalties cost the Pats a big game vs. Indy. They had a consistent problem of committing stupid penalties in big situations.|`|ABoo1doVaa	Because they suck.|`|a4f17786434be41d57b2e22017646256aa	Cause we couldnt get past the luckiest team in the history of the NFL.

They were 3-0. Then they started slipping and getting injuries to the RB's. We went through 7 of them. That has to be an NFL record. They started having mental errors and that causes turnovers. Couldn't punch it in in the red zone. Our defense just added insult on injury. They were horrendous. They couldn't stop anyone. With McDaniels and Nolan running the O & D, now, Denver will be a very unpredictable team this coming season. Heck, I'm not even sure what to expect, although I always expect the best. But finishing 8-8 explains Denver's season in a nutshell. Very good O (with a couple of "quick fixes", will be the best) and a disastrous defense. A .500 club.|`|cM3jYmIYaa	The Green Bay Packers did not do well this season because of this. Well let's see, the play of our offense would of gotten us to the playoffs. But we lost Barnett and defense played horrible. We couldn't stop the run or teams on third downs. W lost 7 games by less than 5 points. We just couldn't close out close games. Under Dom Capers, our new DC, who runs a 3-4 defense. Kampman moving to OLB and probably drafting a new young CB or LB, probably CB Malcolm Jenkins we should win the North easily. I also have a good feeling that the 49ers will win the west too.|`|AUjTaLvwaa	after losing romo and other key players (2nd string rb felix jones, pro bowl punter mat mcbriar, ss roy williams) in an OT loss to the cardinals, everything just went downhill from there. the absence of romo affected the whole team and we managed to lose to the 2-14 rams, and the giants (a team that struggles when playing romo). of course when he came back we started 3-0 but after losing to pittsburgh the whole team started to become very dysfunctional. off-the-field distractions and an underachieving defense caused us to lose 3 of our last 4 games, and knocking us out of the playoffs...|`|zDYEKx67aa	My team was the Colts, I think it was because of too many injuries to our defensive line that made our defense look horrible. I mean the only real reason we made the playoffs is because of Peyton Manning. He came back from knee surgery so he wasn't all the way there. And another reason we didn't do as well is because  of Coach Dungy, Yes sorry to upset colts fan but i believe he may have gotten homesick and tired of coaching. Because he had been coaching that long. And that's basically it, otherwise it was a pretty good season. GO COLTS!|`|xxtvhn5Naa	I'm a Chargers fan, and the main reason my team didn't get to the Super Bowl is because LT and Merriman got injured.  Merriman got injured early in the season, played one game, and was out for the rest of the season.  This greatly hurt the Chargers D.  He is their emotional leader, so for the first half of the season, the Chargers D looked really sluggish and unmotivated.  Lt was off and on over the course of the season.  he played good one game, then was out the next game.  Good thing the Chargers have Darren Sproles to help out with that.  LT still managed to get over 1000 rushing yards this season, but had a career low in rushing yardage, yards per rush, and TDs.  And because of Merriman's injuries, the D wasn't as good as last year, not even close as good.  This allowed the opposing teams O to be on the field for a LOT longer than the Chargers offense.  The Chargers O was the best its been in a long time.  Rivers and Jackson both had career games.  Gates had career lows in TDs and receiving yardage.  Another reason the Chargers D allowed the other teams O to be on the field so long, was because they failed to create turnovers and sack the QB.  The Chargers DBs need some serious work, after allowing the most catches my a D in the NFL.  The Chargers will probably address that need in the draft, as well as the need for a pass rushing DE.  The coaching also wasn't as good as last year.  The Chargers D coordinator was fired in the middle of the season, because of the lame D.  The play-calling stunk throughout most of the season.      EDIT: The Chargers OLine was also not up to speed.  They  allowed was to many sacks, and stunk as run blocking.  that was one of the main reasons LT wasn't as good as before.  The Chargers will probably address that need in FA or the draft also.  Expect them to take a RT or RG early in the draft.|`|RS3fjNboaa	Jerry Jones.

Cromartie wasnt trying his all this season compared to last last season. Quinton Jammer was putting in his effort in every game/every play.    -i think losing our lead blocker (lorenzo Neal) kinda messed up our run game a bit as well.    -and last but not least, LT getting older, gosh that bother me. and his injury in the beginning, kinda messed us up.    next season i can only wait to see weither or not LT stays or doesnt, i hope he does. if not, i hope we get Knowshown Moreno or Chris wells.|`|nRSjUKJZaa	Denver's defense couldn't stop anyone and we had no running game.

I was at that game and I saw the dissapointment that the eagles went through after the match, they will want to rectify this performance and even though its just the nab cup - some of our young stars will shine.    Lewis Stevenson and Will Sullivan, picked in the 2007 draft. Sullivan, just 2cm shorter than Dean Cox and he even beat coxy in some hitouts in the intraclub match earlier this week. Stevenson, an explosive midfielder.     I hope its close and regardless of wether the eagles win or loose, i cant wait to see the new young talent down here in WA.     My tip is the pies by 18, and i know im tipping against my team - but im a typical eagles fan, we really dont care if we loose the nab cup.|`|DkImvrpgaa	should be a good game i think West Coast will just get over the line with good draft picks and all also because its in Western Australia like you said it will be really good seeing all the young players playing|`|7Ek9YkUhaa	I don't get the opportunity to watch them play live that often, so i'm very excited and I don't care if it's nab or whatever, it is a chance to see them play and cheer on the boys in the blue and gold!    Eight West Coast players are debuting in tomorrow nights clash.    Scott Burns said yesterday; We are taking eight players who are in line to debut and another seven or eight who have played under 20 games, so it is a wonderful opportunity for them to play in front of a home crowd against a Collingwood team that have only four or five different players to the one which won an interstate final last year."    Still with that being said and our lack of effort in nab games, with our extended preseason and a bit of wishful thinking it will be West Coast by 15.    If we lose we will be heading the Alice Springs for the 5 consecutive time... where players are more likely to get injured, I'm keep thinking about Mitch Brown doing his knee on the dodgy Albany ground in round 1 of the nab cup and hasn't played a game since, really don't want to see this happen to another player, hope we steer clear of those grounds!

Rt6ajbqoaa	either bundle up or get on a tredmil, you can cross train inside with weights and core work|`|pkoWA5HNaa	If the cold / wet is unbearable, you have to train indoors.   The guideline for intermediate teen runners is train indoors for outside temp under 10C. So it's treadmill or sports hall for temp under 10C or pouring with rain. If you are serious try using a gym treadmill: for sprinting you can do reps, for distance running do reps and distance. If you are a sprinter you need to get into a sports hall at least once a week to train doing reps as the treadmill dictates you stride rather than your natural stride. A treadmill at home would be expensive and they need maintenace. If you get stuck or can't get to a gym, do loads and loads of stretching indoors, jog on the spot and do a quick session outdoors. Good luck.|`|rBIfGH1Baa	I live in Jersey and run cross country and track and also wrestle. since i always have to lose weight for wrestling and train for spring track i would put a couple layers on and go running like usual outside, or i would run on my treadmill.

JcGi56qkaa	I havent the slightest idea.     People who hate Triple H are going to run their mouth cause in my opinion they arent real wrestling fans. They go by what they read on smark websites and think its all true. These people have no life and are just trying to piss people off. Most times its usually girls under the age of 16 who are Hardy fans who have in their head that they will marry Jeff someday.     People who hate on Jeff Hardy as usually people who are older fans living in the past. Scared of change. To those people I say change is a part of life get over it. If you want the "golden era" build a time machine or stop watching todays wrestling. Just because Ric Flair or Harley Race didnt swanton off a ladder doesnt mean Jeff Hardy is over-rated because he does. Its okay Flair and Race are still legends its just times have changed.    I really dont get why people hate on jbl he is like the only true heel in wwe and he plays the role really well. I guess the people that hate on him are attitude marks who want to see the APA reunite.     Guess their will always be haters you just have to ignore them. They are looking for you to respond so they can spout more hate.|`|Jy7t6grDaa	well their are 3 types of superstars    1. The ones you love.  2. The ones you love to hate.  3.The ones you dont even pay attention to    i guess people like to hate on superstars because they love to hate them, its what makes the show the longest running series in television history. WWE makes it to where your just gonna want to rant on certain superstars.    i personally respect all superstars although i hate some of the characters displayed on the shows, its what keeps the WWE alive. if everyone loved all the superstars it would bore everyone, thats like watchin football and everyone wants the same team to win. what would keep it going? it would be rather pointless, much like this question.|`|41WXZPnCaa	I Really Don't Think So But It's Damn True     I Hate Orton And Jeff And Always Speak Of Them ??

Dedicated fans are what makes the WWE as popular as the NBA and NFL|`|h9PVRHPWaa	Great question. Personally I think its just to piss off the fans of said wrestlers. Why else would you focus on the stuff you don`t like instead of what you do.|`|UWJinEbIaa	So called "haters" probably are not wrestling fans to begin with they are only here to play their little "games" like trying to "invade" sections.|`|H3nbC71eaa	I think they just like to prove their point as to what's wrong with the wrestler. I personally don't feel the need to do that whatsoever. I'm not a fan at all of JBL..and I very rarely mention him...only if the question deems it.  I don't like to get so focused on why I don't like a certain wrestler..I like it better to just talk wrestling in general while on Y/A.|`|IMu3wBu8aa	I know. I don't understand it at all. I've noticed it happens in other sections as well. I wouldn't be surprised if our section had the most hate though. I don't understand why people waste their time and talk about wrestlers they do not like. ALL Wrestlers should be respected. It's sad most people don't know that. Why can't the haters just ignore the people who they hate, and talk about their favorite wrestlers? It doesn't make sense to me at all. I was in books and authors and they have multiple questions about how much Twilight sucks. WHY even bother wasting time to post things like that? The Twilight haters are worse than the obsessed fans. The people who don't like Cena are the worst kind of haters I have ever seen. I won't go into detail because we would be here all night talking about it. Hate=immaturity. It's also a waste of time. I won't ever understand it.|`|NZKramllaa	Those would be the trade-marks of haters, They spend more time talking about the person they dislike whether than the person they do like, Its just not Triple H, Jeff Hardy, JBL The worse of them all Cena !!! I see his haters just can't keep their mouths closed about him, They are so worried about, Its very Ironic everytime someone ask a question about Cena It gets over 20 answers. Just his name Cena attracts people, but Everyone supposedly hates him. In my view If you hate a Wrestler, You should pay no attention to him or her, they should be the last person on your list to talk about.|`|a4f5eff9502035e4660ac34d96e762a7aa	just part of the wrestling fantasy world|`|ptQ5SkPVaa	What's really sad is some of these people call themselves adults. You can't even answer or ask a question with out the hate coming out. If they don't hate the wrestler then they hate the user. It's quite sad. I don't hate anyone or any wrestler.|`|fV9SawuPaa	I'll admit I have my certain dislikes for a few wrestlers, but yes it is stupid to come on here with a bag full of hate. Ranting on and on about HHH's politics, cry cry cry, Cena is overrated, cry cry cry, Jeff Hardy is a druggie, cry cry cry. It's ridiculous. Like any of these guys are even that bad. Sure HHH takes advantage of his opportunities he's given. Durr no Vince I do not want to make more money and support my family even more *hits own head*. Cena is over pushed by Vinnie, as is Trips, they don't have much control over it. Jeff has smoked reefer. Big flippin' deal. It's not like he's giving crack to underage kids, or is doing hard drugs. Give the guy a break.|`|ZUTfMc8vaa	beats me|`|77uc2xXUaa	Because they don't like them, so they talk bad about them.. I'm sure you do the same
8c150d798507c1b0ae472762150207b6aa	What up Jeark@ymail,    Your question is tough because it depends on what type of basketball you are playing.    If you are playing pick up basketball - it depends on the members of your team- and if there is not a decent ball handler on your team then maybe you can play point guard.  Although you'll have to be able to hit open jumpers.  4 out of 10 from the three point line is actually not bad.      For your size i would say you're probably a Small Forward who may help with bringing the ball up.  You may be a good person to catch the ball up top and feed the post.      If you're playing on the team- usually the coach makes that decision based on the players on the team.      Your OK ball-handling skills will probably take away the ability to be a point guard- even though you're a great passer- so i'm going to say you're probably a small forward- although if there  aren't too many muscular guys -- you may be needed to bang down low as a power forward.    Good luck,    Nickster|`|Cm2vFHQDaa	waterboy- just kidding . whatever postion you are comfortable with|`|q8QPegTGaa	if u have a lot of stamina sf-pf if u dont work on shooting then pg-sg, and it wud be hard to be a pf cause of ur height but im guessing ur gonna be playing junior varsity|`|lNKA5aECaa	i think you should be a point guard.... if your a good passer and an ok ball handler you should play that roll. now this is what you do.. work more on your ball handling... you don't really need a good jump shot but it helps. so have someone pass the ball to you as you run from elbow to elbow(the elbow is the corner of the free throw)... start working on your mid-range first then long distance...  if you practice every day constantly it WILL get better... im 5'6 and i play point for my high school team.. i don't shoot. i get all my points in the key area. being "muscular" works well when you drive. you can create contact and be able to finish.  good luck!
9i1r2VBHaa	Your legs, shoulders and forearm are absolutely key to your throwing abilities. These muscle groups should be focused on while in the off season, as well as a throwing regimen. I coach and i regularly refer my quarterbacks to our baseball pitching coach for good throwing workouts that do not hurt the shoulder. Hope this helps.|`|H1VIZsutaa	Depends how accurate of a passer you are. If you can hit a receiver in the numbers at 25 to 30 yards, then lift more. If not, then throw more.|`|a4f17786434be41d57b2e22017646256aa	Lift more.|`|2hV2fmZEaa	depends. if your in high school, which im guessing you are, you should focus on throwing more. you need to get a feel for different defenses and when and when not to throw the ball. accuracy also helps. also remember that quarterbacks are not required to be the most athletic person on the team. but dont just ignore weightlifting. you dont want to be a weakling.|`|ZpH2PFF9aa	weight room first then start throwing.|`|9GXxvfnOaa	both, practice makes perfect and be a good all around player
iO12Vjnvaa	Apparently your question was mis-directed by the Y/A servers.  To answer, a sports banquet is an event held usually in the early spring at most high schools to honor those individuals who have earned letters or high achievement in the sports that they participated in the previous year. Some times food is served but if your school is as cheap as mine was many many moons ago....you won't get nothing to eat. But it should be fun. Have fun!    By the way as the "Goodwill Ambassador" for the NASCAR section on Y/A I would like to welcome you in, ask you to wipe your feet, and please stay as long as you like. You'll find that most of here in NASCAR NATION are generally pretty friendly and enjoy talking about our favorite sport. So please stick around, hopefully you'll catch the racing bug like the rest of us have!    Just an opinion as always.|`|sM6d8ZgWaa	It's the big party they have at the end of the season to hand out the hard wear ( trophy's  and cash )|`|LVC8BTtLaa	basically you dress nice and often pay for entrance and eat free buffet and then the players of the sport u play often get honored. mostly seniors and any other outstanding players.

The pride you see in a hockey game.   The support that all the fans give.  The teamwork that goes around, including the fans cause they play a big part.  It's always something great to talk about.  It's never a dull moment! there's always something going on, either a fight, a goal, a SO , etc.  To see the amazing talent that these kids bring at such a young age!  I personally am a flames fan, & when calgary goes into the playoffs especially if you look at our C of Red, it's seriously great. We have such pride & joy towards this team no matter what the losses are, even if we've won only one cup. We still cheer them on.  It's a great feeling =)|`|UULgRsDSaa	because of the intensity and the fast pace it has|`|afc752d0255a5ec4cab67e23e63f6ad6aa	The fans. they are the most dedicated fans and its just amazing watching them rally around their team in the playoffs|`|PwED69Isaa	It is a great sport with a lot of history. There is constant action (assuming you understand the game). One of the best "team" sports.    I want to add something. Hockey players aren't selfish "in the spotlight" players that you get in many other sports. They are great guys that care more about the game and the team than their paycheck (for the most-part). It is so easy to support these guys. They deserve the great fans.

d0bd239f3c115d58ab2ab71d96618ad2aa	Strangely these are about the same temperatures that I'm experiencing at present. (Only mine are Celsius stinking hot). My pre dawn rides in the middle of winter get as cold as yours, Though rarely are mine wet and never any snow.     When the temperatures are low enough it doesn't matter which set of "dangling bits" you have, they can get uncomfortably cold. Coldness in the extremities will also reduce the rate that triglycerides and glycogen can be turned into fuel.    Given that you tend to subconsciously, want to keep your "bits" warmer, there is a bit less muscle fuel around and you are probably wearing extra clothing it can be expected that your speed will be down some.  You have also recently increased your distance significantly so it usually takes your body some time to adjust .Riding on wet surfaces won't help either.    In these conditions I would rate 26-29 km/h for about 30 km as a pretty good effort.     The term "dangling bits" is purely descriptive. From Yin's descriptions I'm sure your's wouldn't dangle.|`|Z5xgSATSaa	There are several factors affecting cold weather performance. Muscles have more trouble warming up which slows you down. The heavier clothing needed for cold weather restricts movement. Cold air is more dense, creating more drag.|`|f9soMMuiaa	Me too. That is what I initially thought, and probably true. In the summer, I am alot faster. Probably colder temperature makes it harder for your muscles to expand and get yourself to warm up. Thus the drop in performance. Logically this would make sense.

Brees is the better player, but I really think the Saints jerseys are kinda ugly.  If you want to be unique, go Welker, he's really not all that great imo, and most Pats fans probably have a Brady jersey, so at least you know not everyone is going to have one.|`|C2CCbTRKaa	GET WELKER,EVERYBODY ELSE HAS A BREES JERSEY,BE DIFFERENT.|`|RZIV15e3aa	Wes Welker.

FYpWi4Vwaa	Lebron because he destroyed Kobe in the finals. Plus Kobe is to small to guard Paul. Paul is 6"8 230 and Lebron the better match up is 6'8 270 which makes him stronger and faster than Paul. And the fact that Lebron Averages a career plus of 30 + points a game against Boston helps Lebron's case. Just a little icing on the cake Lebron and the helpless Cavs last year took Boston to game 7 while Kobe and the 10 deep Lakers lost in 6. Lebron scored 30 striaght points against Boston and it was 30 out of his teams last 30. WOW im smart........|`|rwQCRQDJaa	Why fear either?

The 1993-1994 San Antonio Spurs were the first team in NBA history to have the scoring champ (Robinson) and rebounding champ (Dennis Rodman) in the same season. The Chicago Bulls did it 3 straight seasons (1995-1996 to 1997-1998) with Michael Jordan winning the scoring title and Rodman winning the rebounding title.    At a roast several years ago for Charles Barkley, David Robinson said "I'm going to name my newest son after my two favorite athletes, Corey Pavin and Charles Barkley. My son's name will Corey Onionhead Robinson."    The first basket in WNBA history was scored by Penny Toler of the Los Angeles Sparks in a loss to the New York Liberty.    The only 20/20/20 triple double in NBA history was posted by Wilt Chamberlain of the Philadelphia 76ers on February 2, 1968 (22 points, 25 rebounds, 21 assists) in a win against the Detroit Pistons.

L77OlY1naa	Dehydration is a stage in which body lacks enough water and salts. Recognizing the Symptoms of dehydration at earlier stage becomes very vital in order to avoid further serious complications  Recognizing Dehydration Symptoms  Enlarge Image  Dehydration is simply a lack of enough water and electrolytes. Electrolytes are salts that the body uses in major cellular activity, especially within the muscles cells and blood cells. Because we are 70% water dehydration can lead to very serious illnesses and even death (especially in children who can die within a few days) if not remedied in time.    Dehydration symptoms are usually easy to determine, dry mouth, weakness, dry skin when it usually is oily (of course some people normally have dry skin), low blood pressure, headaches, dizziness are some signs and symptoms of dehydration. Dehydration has many causes in addition to heat exhaustion and lack of water that one would normally think of as usual causes of dehydration.. Some of these are excessive vomiting, diarrhea (especially in very young children and infants), and infection.    What causes dehydration?  dehydration symptoms are caused by several things, lack of water either by just not drinking enough or not drinking enough and adding to it extremely hot weather or an increase in exercise that overheats the body (both would be a cause of heat exhaustion and both can lead to heat stroke). Another cause would be any of several digestive problems either due to defects, illness or reaction to certain surgeries on the stomach such as a gastric bypass.    Vomiting and or diarrhea are other important causes. The vomiting might be due to the flu or any disease process therefore precautions must be taken when a loved one, again especially a child, is ill and is vomiting and or has diarrhea.    Exercising is another very important cause, and it doesnt necessarily need to be outdoor exercising or sports, it can be football, basketball, dodge ball in a gym class. Any sport or exercise that causes one to sweat can cause dehydration if it lasts long enough, is strenuous enough or is accompanied by either hot weather or too much clothing.    In addition, drinking too much alcohol can cause dehydration; this is often the case with alcoholics. A main cause of dehydration in the elderly is due to some of the prescriptions they sometimes need to take. If necessary care needs to be taken to make sure that this is prevented.    Signs and symptoms of dehydration  Untreated dehydration can lead to shock (not enough blood to the brains and other important organs). One very important and quite reliable sign is that of extreme (10% of body weight), this can take place with a few days or sometimes within hours. Signs and symptoms of dehydration in children and infants are very important to recognize because they arent always old enough to be able to tell you how they are feeling. Crying without tears, at least three hours without wet diapers, dry mouth and tongue, sunken eyes, abdomen, or cheeks, general fatigue or irritability, high fever, pitting edema (this occurs when the skin doesnt resume its previous shape when pinched and released).    Signs and symptoms in adults and teenagers are: dizziness, dark urine (orange colored and with especially strong odor), dry mouth, weakness, inability to urinate, and nausea and vomiting. Pitting edema (as in children) is also an additional symptom that occurs with dehydration in the elderly and if they are on prescriptions that might cause it then this needs to be checked periodically.    Treatment of dehydration  Prevention should be considered of utmost importance. There are sports drinks, such as Gatorade, that should be made available before, during and after sporting events. Most of these can also be used during illness to prevent dehydration. Should these symptoms be recognized then it is important to not attempt severely dehydrated patients.    The best thing to do at this point is to seek emergency medical help or get them to a doctor as fast as possible. In some cases rehydration can only be done by IV fluids and electrolytes. However, there is a recipe that was created by the WHO (world health organization) in the 1960's that can be given to prevent dehydration. This recipe can also be provided to those who are very ill and are vomiting and it usually can be kept down. This is the recipe    1. Table Salt - 3/4 teaspoon  2. Baking Powder - 1 teaspoon  3. Sugar -4 tablespoons  4. Orange juice - 1 cup  5. Water - 1 quart/liter    In addition in the US there are many grocery stores that provide special drinks for infants and very small children to use when they have diarrhea and vomiting to prevent dehydration. Since, however, most of these brands differ in concentration and ingredients then a doctor should be referred to in order to select the correct brand.    When adults are sick and are keeping all or most food down, then food should be provided, as it has been determined that fast|`|gVYfFSpRaa	Sip water, lay down, and keep using the heating pad, but don't keep it on too long.  I have no idea what it could be, but don't rule out bad indigestion.  One time my indigestion was so bad that my stomach was in severe pain for hours.  I had no idea what caused it because I've never had indigestion problems before and haven't had them since.  All I did was put on some comfortable pants, lay down, and take sips of water (don't gulp it).  It eventually went away (in a few hours).  Good luck!|`|fKAnnQeWaa	Get off the computer and rest.

u3FqxhY8aa	It is going to be more difficult than it ever has been for Roger during his quest for the record (after winning his first slam at least) the problem is that the wall that has been created for Federer to climb keeps growing.  Rafa has not only branched off from being a dominant clay court player, but now he has the arsenal, ability, and official experience to win on all three of the surfaces.  Now there is no such thing as a safe surface when you play Nadal which spells trouble for Roger.  Maybe a mental block has become more the issue, seriously who didn't think after Roger won that fourth set that the momentum and Nadal's supposed "fatigue" would lead him to victory?  I sure thought that Roger had just won the match with all of that coming into account.  Yet the fifth set came and Nadal took it easy 6-2, was the knowledge that in an hour he could be on even terms with his childhood idol get to him? Yes it is a possibility or a factor, but Nadal showed us what he had, and he had a lot.  Although Roger still has plenty of chances to win slams, I am going to have to give Roger one more match against Rafa (not on clay of course), and 5 to 7 slams, and if by then he has not won a match against Rafa (supposing they play on grass or hardcourt) and he has not won a slam, then I may start to ignore him, but until then he is still Roger Federer, and he may have just had a bad set, getting a new coach and sticking with them for good to help him find a strategy will be essential to defeating Rafa in the future.|`|IMwvaKkKaa	Federer is definitely BETTER than Nadal. It really is his mental game. 100%. His style, speed, forehand are way better, but he doesn't go 100% when he plays Nadal for some reason i can tell. his shots tend to be slower even on the not so hard shots, and makes way more unforced errors. he doesn't hit as many angles as he does against nadal, like i said mental. he just needs to work on that and he'll be fine. easier said than done.|`|8qtm4qkUaa	Yes, he can. His serve was well below its best in Melbourne and that cost him badly. If he serves up to his best, he'll beat Nadal. That's why clay has been the toughest for Federer against Rafa - the serve isn't as important on the slow courts.    Federer lost Wimbledon last year because they'd cut the grass too high and slowed the court down; then they played in the dark near the end!    So, don't assume that because Rafa has beaten him, that's how it will always be.|`|DEDmq2OWaa	Rafa is coming into his game fully-  It seems often enough that wins and losses in tennis are all about the match ups. Rafa is in Feds head- 1 he beats him, 2 he isn't afraid of his game- which you see soooo often with other players. Fed can certainly win another Slam he has HUGE GAME- but at this point Fed is going to have to play Rafa differently or Rafa will have to stay home. NOT LIKELY :)|`|1mKJFfieaa	I think he Can...If hes on top of his game and focuses then he can definetly beat Nadal...Great match at the Aussie Open Poor Federer cried but Nadal was ver Humble!!!    We'll see how he does in Wimbledon!    =)|`|AA11645255	it's starting to become mental. i don't know if federer thinks he can beat nadal anymore. kind of how like roddick doesn't really believe he can beat federer. once you get that mindset, you have lost before you've even stepped on the court.    however, i look for federer to bounce back and work extremely hard to reclaim his title at wimbledon. federer will win wimbledon this year, book it.|`|U7BkuEU9aa	Well, he seems to have got into his head that he can't beat Rafa, so if they keep meeting in the finals I don't see Fed winning. If someone takes care of the Spaniard for him first, though, he's capable of thrashing anyone else. ANYONE.|`|pddwVjALaa	Ahhh... Nadal.  That angel that flies across the court and hits the jackpot.      Well I love Nadal and Federer so personally I want BOTH to win. But i think Federer could win again if he gets his old coach back!!!!!    AND LOTS OF PHYSICAL FITNESS!   Nadal is too physical for federer|`|FYd1ndVxaa	I agree. But I believe Federer can cope with it, but not overcome their overall head-to-head records. He has worries inside despite he's known to have been so calm and making play look so effortless. Strive on Federer!! Sometime ago, I read a answerer said he wishes Federer to win 15 slams, and next would be for Nadal to achieve 15 for himself too. That's a good idea for me.|`|6ecdc0fb70eb839a2a22e77ecfde44e4aa	Mr. Bojangles- the answer to your question is more a yes than a no. Roger needs good strategies and a better game plan when playing against Rafa and therefore Roger needs to look for a new coach or a tactician as in Mats Wilander or Brad Gilbert. If Roger can get an extra help from these people then he can see some light at the end of the tunnel. Secondly, he is getting obsessed with the fact of getting to Pete's record. I think that is one of the reasons why he choked in the fifth set at AO. A coach would help him at this stage to take care of that pressure. I still think he has a good shot at Wimbledon and USO and I am sure he has the same plans in mind. Seriously, do you think Roger would retire with 13 slams? I know it sounds ridiculous right now but it is time to get real. He will definitely get those two slams with or without Rafa being in the finals. It is hard but not impossible because he is the only person who stopped Rafa's winning streak of 81 matches on clay at Hamburg in 2007, if you remember. Roger is going to get those two slams sooner or later. Go Rogi!|`|UZBULUuraa	Yes. Nadal took 5 sets to beat Federer. Federer beat some very good opponents convincingly and according to the announcers he lost his legs in the 5th set. Winning another Grand Slam is possible against Nadal or another opponent who could beat Nadal along the way.|`|WRcpeXPMaa	I think he'll win wimbledon and us open|`|MBguTeHAaa	Its not going to be easy. As you know nadal only had the advantage on clay because thats his best surface. So maybe roger could have picked him off one of these yrs. You know maybe nadal is exhausted getting to the finals, or maybe he doesn't make it to the finals or maybe he makes it but is held back by injury and roger could get the win by playing his game. But by nadal beating him at Wimbledon and in Aussie its now clear that nadal is his equal. Before he was competition but only dominated on clay. That has changed with those two victories that I mentioned in the previous sentence.     So can roger still win a grand slam. Yes he can because this is sports and in sports anything can happen but for him to beat nadal he's going to have to take his game to the next level. This happens to athletes that dominate a sport like he has. They start off as unknowns, begin to win, then dominate, and then plateau as the field catches up to them. But even at the plateau level they are still very very good but maybe not as great. They have two choices take their game to the next level and dominate the sport again or accept defeat and fall off. Roger seems like a guy that is determined to be the best so I think he'll take this as a challenge and take that next step.Its crazy though because even at this level he has no equal except nadal.|`|vYEEiWVBaa	The times of Federer winning two or three grandslams a year is finally over. The field is deeper and Nadal is just better than Federer, now getting a little older. I think Federer can still win another grand slam. After all, he has been in the finals of 14 of the last 15 or something ridiculous like that. But, I think the bigger question is if he will be able to beat Sampras' record, and I don't think he has enough left in the tank.     The two slams he has a chance of winning anymore is Wimbledon and the U.S Open, but with Andy Murray emerging and Nadal proving last season that he can win on grass, Wimbledon will be tough for Roger. And their are simply too many good, hard-hitting players with a good hard court game to say that Federer can easily win another U.S Open|`|MQaXTUQRaa	I thought for sure Roger would win, Nadal was exhausted from playing such a long match, how did he pull it off is unknown, but I was truly amazed. I believe that Rafa did deserve this championship.Roger just didn't have it when his nerves& confidence get the best of him.|`|L2ZIM8CHaa	I bet he takes wimby this year|`|qgyums0Waa	of course, YES!!!  Sorry to be very sure with my answer but i believe in ROGER.   (Maybe, just maybe it is another guy whom he fights in a final match)    Because, we all know, RAFA did got ROGER, psychologically on court.|`|VD0wriflaa	I think it is not still over for Federer even though i am a Rafa fan but i think that if Federer puts more hard work into this he could still have a chance to win US open because Nadal has never won Federer easily except on sand courts.|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	yes|`|QlrIUIfOaa	I don't think so.  His biggest barrier is his fragile mental game.  He is a front runner, not a fighter.  To win on the current surfaces that has to change (gritty surface in Australia, sand at Wimbledon, slowed down courts in NY).|`|75ZMWlnnaa	when AND IF federer can get over this mental block he has when he plays against rafa, i think he can definitely win more grand slams.    at the moment, rafa is definitely better than roger.   but another thing to keep in mind is the fact that ONLY if roger beats rafa in a grand slam final will some consider it a "worthy" win. but to me, i guess a win is a win, regardless of the circumstances.    he played great against delpo and roddick, but yeh i agree with u when u say he just could not get past rafa. =(    if roger does not hire a full-time coach between now and wimbledon, expect rafa to win wimbledon once again, and roger has to stop being so stubborn as well, he has NOT adjusted his game to combat rafa, whilst rafa has just been improving his game on all surfaces.    i dont blame roger for being stubborn because from 2004-2007, his only main competition was rafa on clay, he whitewashed the majority of the field playing the game he had been playing, noone would really challenge him, but times have changed alot.    not only does roger have rafa to worry about, but also djokovic, murray, simon, tsonga and all these other up-coming youngsters.    im sure roger knows what to do so he can achieve the best results possible, and as a roger fan, i will respect his decisions.
NaYoqWBOaa	We should be rooting for the Lakers, because we want the  1 seat in the East. But I just can't root for them and Kobe's weasel face.|`|ewW1CY3Waa	CELTICS BY 40|`|ba7cca95147ca64ee9b79a5ddb025566aa	EDIT:  NVMMM hahahaha.  i thought u mean who are u rooting for in the lakers-cavs game.  LMAO sorry :PP    okay yeah definitely root for the LAKERS we need this one :P    and it helps ur team too.  1 in the east.|`|rTbKXMMpaa	I'm rooting for the lakers. They might have Lebron's biggest competition for MVP but the celtics are our biggest competition for the best record in the east. With a loss for the celts, we'll be the only team in the east with single digit losses. With the way Lebron's playing, a win over the celtics won't bring Kobe on top of the MVP rankings as of now. Lebron will still hold his spot and the cavs will be the best team in the east.|`|1gQnSsfHaa	lakers, kobe is hella better than lebron|`|iprIUPtDaa	lakers i have no beef with kobe and crew plus ray allen just stole an allstar spot from mo williams|`|ZCHmhuFQaa	Lakers. I'm a Laker's fan not a Cavs fan. I just want the two points. The Lakers have KOBE, the best finisher in the game.|`|7t7XzXsVaa	I was rooting for Lakers so the Cavs can be  1 in the eastern conference!|`|vzH7f7V5aa	Lakers.
YwgGcERMaa	He was decent considering he was a 6 foot 9 NBA Power Forward that looked small in the ring compared to Hulk Hogan. It was also a cool storyline the Jazz and the Bulls were in the finals the year before and Dennis Rodman with the NWO. OH BTW GO BRAVES. THIS IS THE YEAR WE GO BACK TO THE PLAYOFFS BABY. THE NEW STREAK STARTS IN 2009|`|Ii3Cd5OOaa	His name is Karl Maldone and he's an actor, not a wrestler    please check your facts before you post    thank you|`|7ACBEowxaa	lets just say he is better than arquette, and just under cena.|`|qMrCSjAcaa	He wrestled with Dennis Rodman in the late 90s didn't he?  The dude was built like a WWF Wrestler anyway...and speaks about as incoherently as one too :).    My vote...yes, he was.|`|TAPBWPJLaa	No.    Karl Malone was horrible, and he only appeared in WCW as a publicity stunt and nothing more than that,|`|WtcTBlccaa	your watching tnt huh no but he was a great b-ball player|`|8ivnzNi5aa	No.  He was a basketball player with the Utah Jazz.  NBA Western Division players don't know how to fight like the Eastern Division boys do.|`|it2UVkF4aa	No, only Rod the Bod a.k.a. Dennis Rodman was a good pro wrestler.|`|AA11480859	I think you have to be in wrestling a little longer than he was to even be called a wrestler let alone good|`|Q1MI6L96aa	He was a legit huge fan of pro wrestling and an athlete, so he wasn't a typical celebrity being tossed a script and only pinning an opponent or doing some really bad ring-work. He was a better worker than most, but still a very marginal wrestler.
CBVlu3Gvaa	For Charity.....I'll buy virtually anything...It all goes to a good cause anyway.|`|sBrummATaa	yes cuz charity is great|`|LVjM9k8yaa	I always buy mulligans when I'm playing in Scramble tournaments. The money either goes to a charity or whoever is running the tournament (usually one of my customers) so I fell like I have to. Otherwise, there is no such thing as a mulligan. It's cheating.|`|nkPMesJdaa	absolutely, a great way to increase your funds and it makes the tourney more fun.  :)|`|kT4I3C6caa	It's free when I play!  Since this is for charity fund, I will surely buy a mulligan!|`|m3L6pLBaaa	don't think i could buy enough mulligans to have a good score. i like your idea you should go to your local golf course and see if they will let you do it. you would raise alot of money for relay for life.|`|l3MC9sxgaa	i think itd be a great idea  its not as if the buyers would get a largely unfair advantage, and it all goes to charity  id buy a mulligan|`|bf04eda87a4053f72857e70e26cc077faa	sounds like a brilliant idea!!! I would do it!!!
d0bd239f3c115d58ab2ab71d96618ad2aa	Oh Well  It is controversy time again at Yahoo answers.    It is best practice to keep the shifter and cassette matched on speeds if possible.    However if you want to get an 8 speed shifter to work a 7 speed cassette you can do a reasonable job if you use an alternative cable route at the rear derailleur.    I have done this myself with success. Fortunately you don't have to take just my word for it.    Scroll down to "Alternate Cable Routing"  http://www.sheldonbrown.com/derailer-adj...|`|Z5xgSATSaa	No they would not work very well. The distance between cogs is different for 8 speed than it is for 7 speed. The shifters would only work in friction mode.|`|AA10828835	yep. youd have to fiddle with the adjustment screws on the deraileur so your chain doesnt always keep lookin for the next gear though.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	No, the spacing between the gears is different.  It will work in the friction mode but not the index.
xxtvhn5Naa	haha yeah you got that right|`|VoKzvoxKaa	please......      People say all these stuff on the internet but they cant say it to the public       P.S.  It is easy to be tough on the internet|`|28834ea3162329035a24ce080e7020edaa	Hmmm.     Get your facts straight, he drives a 450. And he is educated unlike you!|`|BqVcz1R1aa	GIT ER DONE!!!       lmao!!!|`|8sfybuGZaa	I don't see one bit of fact in your argument.|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	Ben is a card carrying homosexual..... you should be ashamed of yourself for stereo-typing him|`|WZ6YXDODaa	sounds like somebody is a little on the jealous side here.  STEELERS RULE!!!!!!!|`|KTp27Fokaa	Why is everything a racial issue with you?    I don't see one bit of fact in your argument. You are just flaming a player with a great personality because he's white.|`|SJEXY7Ufaa	hell yeah and obama is a half white gay guy|`|LVjM9k8yaa	With what we have in the White House now at least we have Ben going for us. I'll take that any day.    45-35  Enough Said!    Hook'em!!
HimBbU6caa	Was the pistol registered? How do we know it was an unregistered weapon? It was a music video right? I don't like the violence and nonsense that tends to be associated with modern day hip hop, but to me this is a non-issue. It really is. Let's wait to see if more facts come out.|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	I don't know what to say. It can't be good for him. When are these athletes going to learn. There's a good idea Ed flash a gun around on camera, no one will care.|`|VwccuEFHaa	Being caught doing something viewed as completely innapropriate is never good for your career.  Ive always thought the guy was a punk since he threw a few pitches at Lohse and other cardinal players.  He should probably face consequences, but since he didnt do it in the US, nothing career wise will probably happen except for a few people viewing him different.|`|L77OlY1naa	Dude nothing will be done until Plex who shot himself in the leg goes to trial|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	Jeez why do young athletes through there careers away.     Our prospect Ambiox Burrgos got caught running two women over. I think he was drunk driving. He never played well but now I guarantee hell never be in the bigs again.    Even look at star Micheal Vick and his dog fights. What a loser he used to be my fave nfl qb.    I hope Volquez straightens his act up. Too much talent to go to waist.|`|rjuqrHK7aa	I doesn't mean anything. It is not a big story hear in Cincinnati. It was a bad idea to be seen with a gun, and he will move on with his career. You have to remember that he is in the Dominican Republic. They have different laws and a different way of life. It was on a closed studio set.    It is not Volquez's gun. It was filmed in a studio. The Cincinnati media is not making a big deal about this. It suprised people here at first, but now that we know what it was about it is easier to understand. It was a misunderstanding. I am a Reds fan.    Who said the gun was illegal?|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	Rob Dibble threw at people's heads|`|utTFiz3gaa	... maybe it had no bullets in it.....    well at least he hasn't shot anyone now THAT would be troublesome!! I hope we don't hear about him with a gun again he's a real talented fellow ^^|`|1vCoaf08aa	Oh crap, he's the best pitcher my team has (Reds fan here).    I hope it doesn't hit him like the whole Plaxico Burress thing has.|`|zFlfIOQwaa	i didnt hear about this but if he did get caught with a gun,it wont be that bad for his career. a suspension and not good for his records though. its a shame that such great players have to be innapropriate like this. if not,he is still a wonderful player that has great potential.  hopes this helps you out!|`|cM3jYmIYaa	They'll be looking for him. Hope he's goes to jail bcuz I hate the Reds.|`|AA10349169	maybe he was the they guy who took the photo of phelps?
AA10297143	Mark McGuire had one super hot season and was known as a "basher" his entire career.  Derek Jeter is the more well rounded player and considered a team leader.  I like McGuire, and definitely not a Yankee or a Jeter fan, but Jeter wins this contest hands down.|`|fjNxzd6Baa	Jeter by far, and I'm a Red Sox fan.|`|szkrumAJaa	DJ|`|WcUuH7i3aa	DEREK JETER BECAUSE HE IS AMAZING|`|RAjycr4waa	Without Mac we're not even having this discussion.

If you can strike out and STILL be considered one of the best in the game,you've got something goin for you and that's exactly what Derek Jeter has.|`|IMWU7SICaa	Mark Mcgwire dudes. Jeter is a big *** show off. I cant wait until he gets his teeth knocked out by something. Like a ball|`|dmci2TKBaa	Is this a serious question?  Jeter by far.|`|epjPLClsaa	Mark Mcgwire  Just because I am a cardinal fan|`|G4BSv4jbaa	Derek Jeter - Rookie of the Year, 3 Gold Gloves at a much tougher position, 3 Silver Slugger Awards, World Series MVP, All-Star MVP, 4 World Series rings, and captain of the most famous team in the world.    Most importantly? He plays the game clean and correctly, he is a great role model for the fans, and there is never controversy surrounding him.|`|OPSFSpRsaa	Derek Jeter is a hell of a lot better than Mcqwire.  Not even because Mac used steroids but even with that handicap Derek Jeter is an all around great baseball player, year in and year out.
YYqrT4jBaa	The better of the two is the Vantage. If you're on a budget then by all means get the Vantage. If you can spend a little more, get the V-Force Profiler.     If you don't want to spend more on a different mask, then get a dual-pane thermal lens for the Vantage. It will fix fogging problems you may or may not have.    Last, never ever buy from airsplat.com. I tried to purchase something there once. Said it was in stock when i ordered it, but weeks later I was told it was backordered. Waited for a month and a half, it never came. I cancelled the order.

DOVbF4Piaa	Cycling at 70-90 rpm's with a lite pressure is good for the cardiovascular system.  It uses your slow twitch muscles that use fat as a fuel and wont wear out you legs.  Pedaling hard will cause you to switch over to the fast twitch muscles that use glycogen as a fuel and will burn out your legs quicker.  This is when your legs tighten up and you cant supply enough fuel and oxygen to the muscle.    Interval training is good for both types of muscles.  You don't want to over do it to where you shutdown but can go for 30-60 seconds at the higher level and then drop back to recover.    Here is a good explanation of how to best use your muscles.    http://www.beginnertriathlete.com/cms/ar...|`|Y3KMLdjWaa	In your muscles you have two types of fibers, slow and fast twitch. Each does a certain type of work and depending on your work out. What you did when you got to the point of muscle fatigue is tear apart the muscle fibers, this is not bad, what happens is that when muscle is torn down is repairs it self to so it can be stronger the next time.   Here is a good article that goes in to more detail.   http://sportsmedicine.about.com/od/anato...|`|Z5xgSATSaa	If you want to build endurance, riding at lower difficulty for a longer period is what you want to do. If you want to build strength, do some intervals at a higher effort. You can't really measure speed on an exercise bike, you can measure your cadence (how fast you spin the pedals), and you can measure heartrate using a heart rate monitor. This is the only way to measure the level of effort you are putting out. The tension adjustment is only a way of setting your bike to a known level of effort, and can vary from bike to bike. I would not spend too much time pedaling at high tension levels, it is a good way to damage your knees if you ride like that all the time.

085ceb5bb7c326a63e32a1f2eb169f02aa	There is a rubber seal that goes between the inside of the pump to make sure you are pushing air into the volleyball.  It sounds like the seal has rotted out.  I am guessing that you will need a new pump.|`|k8veKLdlaa	The Volley ball should have a black hole in it that you can insert the needle into once you have attached the needle to to the pump of course.   Then you stick the needle into the black hole thing and pump.|`|C5UUltHtaa	You have explained it well. The lube is what keeps a good seal on the piston inside the pump. But I am not familiar with your pump so if you don't see a place to insert more lube then I'd say just remove the needle and carefully place a few drops of lube (vegetable oil will work) and move the pump handle up and down a few times to get it evenly coated.  Hope this helps

They have 15 numbers retired..I'm sure they have enough to keep going.Yankees have 17 and they haven't gone to fractions yet.|`|lHzBJA4eaa	I agree, they should just fold .I mean , what are they going to do start using letters?

I used to know every number on my favorite team-in fact when I actually see a number that is less than 20 I automatically think of someone who played 15-20 years ago. I don't know why, but the smaller numbers are easier to match to a name (Gretzky being the exception).

AA10774713	No I do not recommend wearing that jacket.  That's more of a fashionable jacket than a functional one.  Like someone else said, it's fine to wear in the city but not for snowsports.  For one thing, it's feather mixed with down.  Feathers and down aren't the same thing.  Feathers are the part with the quills and down is the soft hairs from the goose's chest.  The down is what insulates, not the feathers.  Higher quality down jacket don't contain feathers in them and are more insulating, therefore warmer.    Also, that jacket has no water repellency what-so-ever.  When you're in the snow, you want some sort of protection from the elements, so you're gonna need something that has at least minimal water repellency or if you're in heavy conditions a fully waterproof jacket.  I forgot to mention earlier that you can get a good jacket at a sporting goods store like Sport Chalet or REI.  So anyway, as I was saying- it's good to read the tags on the jackets, that way you know what you're buying.  It usually has a lot of information about the jacket itself.  It usually tells you about any insulation it may have, what they used to waterproof it with, the waterproof rating, and so on.  Waterproof ratings are important.  Basically, look for a number that's in the thousands and measured in millimeters.  The higher that number is, the more waterproof the garmet is.  Generally the more waterproof, the more expensive the jacket will be.  Some jackets come with seam sealing (either critical or fully seam sealed)- basically that means they tape up the sames of the jacket from the inside to make sure no water seeps through the seams.  Critical means they only tape the main parts of the jacket like the shoulder or wheever is likely to get the wetest.  Fully seam sealed means every seam of the garmet is taped.  Seam sealing also adds to the cost.  A lot of customers ask me why the jackets cost so much and what i'm telling you is part of the reason...the other part has to do with all the R&D that goes into designing a jacket as well as name brands.    So back to reading the tag- There's also a number measured in grams.  That is your breathability rating.  The higher that number is, the more breathable the fabric is.  Generally, waterproofing can sometimes reduce a garment's breathability with the exception to Gore-tex (a fully waterproof and fully breathable membrane that they sandwich between the outer layer of a jacket/pants and the inner layer).  You want something that can breathe so it doesn't get all steamy and uncomfortable inside.    There's a lot more I could tell you but that would turn into pages and pages but those are the main things I tell customers.  Oh, one last thing I forgot to mention- get a jacket with a powder skirt (it looks like a flap inside the jacket that buttons around your hips) to keep the snow from flying up into your jacket.  Also, about that other person's answer regarding a jacket with a liner.  That's not exactly necessary because honestly, companies just make jackets with liners as a marketing scheme to get you to purchase 2 jackets.  That's all it really is.  You can buy a seperate shell (the main jacket you wear on the outside) and layer it with something else like your own fleece jacket (which is what most liners pretty much are), fleece pullover, or merino wool sweater.    LASTLY, THE NUMBER ONE RULE OF ALL- NEVER EVER WEAR COTTON!!!  It absorbs and holds moisture...takes forever to dry and it wet cotton on your body will make you chafe and feel colder.  The moisture is basically freezing so you're wearing an ice pack.  Think of it like stepping out of the shower on a cold day- you feel cold until you dry your body off.  Same idea.  Wear synthetic fabrics (with the exception of wool and goose down which are good).  If you wear a goose down jacket, make sure it is treated with waterproofing if you wear it as your main jacket- without any waterproofing, goose down isn't warm if it gets wet.|`|8tqQXcp4aa	I don't think those are the type to go snowboarding in. You need those type of jackets with the liners. Like the Columbia or Burton, Under Armour ones.

0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	great question man.  I live near Pittsburgh so for me its the Steelers.  Ive lived here 31 years, its been brutal.  On a scale of 1-10, I hate the Steelers a 10 and Philadelphia a 9.9.  Here is some great stats for your viewing pleasure    The Steelers Do Not Have:  20 Consecutive Winning Seasons.  The NFL All Time Leading Rusher.  *Most appearances in a Super Bowl (8)  *Most wins on Monday night Football (41)  *Most appearances in the NFC Championship game (14)  *The Cowboys' streak of 160 sold-out regular and post-season games included 79 straight sellouts at their home, Texas Stadium, and 81 straight sell-outs on the road.  *Cowboys are the most valuable football franchise in the world, with an estimated value of $1.612 billion.  *They are also one of the wealthiest teams in the NFL, generating almost $250 million in annual revenue.  *Most consecutive winning seasons (20, from 1966 to 1985)  *Most seasons with at least 10 wins (24)  *The team has earned the most postseason appearances (28, which includes another league record of 55 postseason games, winning 32 of them)  *The Cowboys became the first team in NFL history to win 3 Super Bowls in just 4 years. (Also the only other team to do that is the Pats)        Dallas best vs Steelers best    Passing Leader (all-time): Troy Aikman - 32,942 yards  Rushing Leader (all-time): Emmitt Smith - 17,162 yards  Receiving Leader (all-time): Michael Irvin - 11,904 yards  Winningest Coach (all-time): Tom Landry - 250 wins    Passing Leader (all-time): Terry Bradshaw - 27,989 yards  Rushing Leader (all-time): Franco Harris - 11,950 yards  Receiving Leader (all-time): Hines Ward - 9,780 yards  Winningest Coach (all-time): Chuck Noll - 193 wins      The Steelers got 6*  in 76 years. Dallas has won it 5 times 49. I'm not great at math but by my account, we have 27 years to catch up. They still trail us 32-31 in playoff wins despite nearly a 3 decade head start and our more than dozen year drought in the postseason.|`|4ec0a31b1f8ce574de49a57391c919f9aa	id have to say i hate the cowboys...the most overrated team ever|`|O0b9Kiosaa	49ers fan:  Anybody but the Cowgirls!|`|qP6KdI6Baa	I used to love the Cowboys(Dallas where I live). But then stupid Tony Romo came in and he ruined the Cowboys the teams that I hate the most are (in order.)    1st Philadelphia Eagles  and   2nd Pittsburgh Steelers  if Ravens ere on here i would put them second.  I dont hate the Eagles and the Ravens because the Cowboys lost to them , I hated them before that.     Glad I Could Help!!|`|v0aKxF6iaa	The Giants the fans are soooo annoying and think they know everything. Well at least the ones at the games i mean Tony Homo come on be more original please. So i guess thats why i hate the team so much because the fans at the games cant just shut up and watch the damn game.|`|AUjTaLvwaa	i cannot stand the eagles. if we went 15-1 or 14-2, the losses would be to them. we never seem to do that good against them (except in 05) and when we win it's usually a close game, but when they beat us, the score is usually pretty one-sided. also, their fans act like it's the superbowl when they beat us (but i'll give them that, just to be generous because you know...they don't have any!). giants and redskins aren't that much of a threat to us. i hate the steelers for beating us twice in the superbowl but it was obvious that they'd get 6 before us considering the performance of our team in past years...and last season was just a big, giant fluke for the giants.|`|xP08melDaa	i'm a redskins fan 4 life.... i f'in hate the eaglesw to deaths   -were in a slump and we went 8-8.. but two of our wins came against the eagles... ffs if you lose to the redskins twice... then you don't deserve to go to the NFC championship.. Stupid eagles...|`|rNUyV1EYaa	The Giants. Maybe it's because I have some bandwagon Giants fans in my life to deal with- you know, the type that never liked the Giants until last year.    As for the Steelers; yeah, they have six Super Bowls, but I am not bothered much by that. I know I should be; but the Cowboys are partially to blame (they lost to Pittsburgh in the Super Bowl twice in the '70's).    So my hate list goes:    1. Giants  2. Eagles  3. Redskins  4. Steelers|`|rM9WzIkHaa	im not a cowboy fan but i love the eagles and 49ers and the team i hate is the cowboys packers broncos patriots|`|RS3fjNboaa	I only "hate" those teams because they have played the Cowboys enough times to develop some very intense rivalries. It's not personal hate, though. It's just a rivalry thing.    Anybody that says the Cowboys are the most overrated football team ever obviously don't know much about football. That's just ignorance talking.|`|30LMCJrAaa	Washington is the all time worst, most hated by Cowboy fans...  Followed closely by Philly  then the Giants  then Pittsburgh, but when do we play them???  then 49s...but not too much now that they haven't been competition in some time.
AA11346749	Its perfectly safe. I've never heard of a smoothbore or 22 mag shotgun.     A smooth bore is NOT "needed" for shotshells, rifling is not needed but there are some custom shotguns that have straight groove rifling to prevent wad rotation. Rifling/no rifling makes no difference in rifle/pistol/shotguns as far as safety - just accuracy is affected.    CCI makes those shotshells to use in rifles and pistols in calibers from .22 right up to .44 Mag and .45ACP. As long as the caliber you buy is the caliber of your rifle/pistol you're fine...neither the lead  12 shot or plastic shot cup will harm the barrel. If they are just crimped, same thing, no harm.    Mainly these are called "snake shot"....used for dispatching snakes with a pistol or rifle.|`|h2KkiKK3aa	ok, the manufacturers thought about that too, that's why their only made with  12 shot, it's so light that it can't damage the rifling, 100% safe.  their only good for squirrels, mice, rats and other rodents, it was actually made for indoor use like in barns to kill these pests, so you don't blow holes in the walls.|`|gpON465Iaa	It is not perfectly safe|`|DHIudHy2aa	If you can find shotshells that come in .22 magnum than go for it I guess. I really don't see that happening however.|`|1b98dcf55f3a990e7013ba04e6691faaaa	The .22 shotshells that I have used had a plastic cup that holds the shot until it exits the barrel.  So you have a plastic shot cup between the shot and the barrel.  Steel is harder than plastic.  If the plastic disintegrates, then you have lead shot against a steel barrel.  Steel is harder than lead.    I've used .22 shotshells in my rifle; and have never had any problems.  I think the rifling makes the shot not pattern very well; so it is only good for really close range.  (Shotguns have smooth bores to help the shot pattern better; rifling causes pellets to disperse.)    for Larry:  http://www.cheaperthandirt.com/64450-5.h...|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	* Yes *
7qXvTld2aa	I would think about talking to one of the coaches, even the assistant coaches.  If you go to them and ask what you can do to make your game better they will not only be impressed that you are taking initiative they will also be happy that you are looking to improve your game for the better of the team.  Otherwise just keep practicing, you are a basketball player and if you are playing in high school you know what you need to do, just keep going for it.|`|D2CC2t0kaa	Layups: just practice under the rim      Dribbling: Figure 8, Spider, Crossover, and Behind the back. Type in "dribbling drills" on Google      Turnovers will decrease with improved ball handling|`|a112fa2d0ccf1099eec1119d4da5e902aa	First of all, you've gotta have speed and quickness, with or without the ball but especially with the ball.  Secondly, you've gotta be an excellent ballhandler.  Thirdly, you must have great court vision, that is, you know where the other 9 players are, plus the 3 refs, in any given moment.  Lastly, you must look to PASS FIRST in each play, shooting being your last option.|`|eDNH4Ihgaa	Hey there B-Baller! HAHA, ain't I crazy?    Have you heard the word? HAHA that is my little rhyme I made up. But really, have you heard the word of God, and the good book? It will answer all your qeustions for you!|`|aX9tb3D4aa	for not turning the ball over, i suggest playing 1 on 1 for some practice. For the handling and dribbling, there are some helpful drills. This is called around the waist. You just circle the ball around your waist for about 2 minutes one way, than 2 minutes the other way. You can also do the drill called the figure 8. You just make the ball go around your legs like a figure 8. The only way to get better aw lay ups is just to do them slowly. Once you get the teqnique down, try speeding it up until you get good at it. Those are some tips.|`|v3I7288kaa	You just have to keep practicing. Point guards dribble up court and always try to get teammates open. You have to spend lots of time just dribbling and passing with a friend/teammate.   Start by dribbling while looking at the ball. Eventually lift your head until you don't need to look at the ball. Point guards must be able to assess their surroundings to find the best option.   Try doing layups at a slow pace. I believe you already know how to do a simple layup. Repetition helps you improve. When you get good, try to run and lay it in. Once the right hand gets good, use the left. It may seem stupid but you have to be ready for anything.
aTBs7pJ4aa	well it depends on the duration of your training... if u are talking about training with weightlifting and tennis then i would say lift weights for 45 mins and then play tennis for an hour and a half tops...    make sure u train all and each different muscle once or twice a week...     it also about the supplments u take.. u need the whey protein and the glutamine for maxiumum recovery and muscle repair.. as well as sufficent carbs before training...    goodluck|`|hCLmczgMaa	play as much as you can!

9OqSl1Jlaa	Yes.  He admitted he broke the law.  He needs just punishment for doing so.|`|7L0zp7O6aa	He got off easy so it's not fair.  Any non public figure would have to go through so much more along with a record to deal with.  He's lucky.  I'm just glad it wasn't swept under the rug.  And to those who say everyone does it, I do not and know many who don't.  It's against the law no matter how stupid the law is.  He's a criminal and should be dealt with.|`|37PYnKr9aa	He is a role model and shouldnt have done that.. I dont think he should get all this drama towards him, but celebs have higher class than us regulars|`|AA12205301	I don't particularly feel it is anyones business. However he is a role model to many younger kids. Is it fair that it was splashed all over the news about Clinton smoking but not inhaling, Is it fair that we got told all about Bush's drinking problems of the past, is it fair that some news programs have talked about Obama's smoking cigarettes?  No, but they are public figures just as Phelps is.  I don't believe the news or paparrazi should be into people's private lives etc, but when you choose to go public you are considered fair game.|`|iCLGHUdQaa	Fair?  I think it's disgusting that he still has sponsors willing to pay him.  Don't get me wrong - we've all smoked - but when you're paid basically to be a roll-model, that's not the crap that you do.  And when you're part of a sport or any organization that prohibits the use of "drugs" then you've got to face the consequences (suspension) that they deem appropriate.    I should also add that when you tout yourself as being a roll model and talk about kids and how you affect the lives of children you should really think about what you do.  You know you are in the limelight.  Act appropriately.|`|mNJFttV6aa	His punishment is fitting his behavior!  He is an embarrassment to the USA Swim Team and American youth, I'd go so far as to say globally.|`|y5iJ50nxaa	heck no who hasn't smoked a dewie once or twice|`|ASsciJ4Faa	hell no, he wins 8 gold medals in the olympics, smokes one bong and he is thrown under the bus. 95% of people in the US have tried drugs.|`|WqkhDIVKaa	He really hasn't gone through that much yet. This should be a wake up call.|`|RAjycr4waa	As a public figure it was bound to happen because a few people make a fuss about it. Then the higher ups get pressured from everyone including the media to take action. In reality the 3 month punishment won't mean much and its a slap on the wrist. Phelps gets attacked by a bunch of jealous media people for a while and as soon as he is back in the pool all is forgiven.    Personally I don't think what he did was wrong in the first place. However, older generations and uninformed people think marijuana is a terrible drug even though I would argue its safer than alcohol. Someday it will lose this bad wrap its got but it will take some time for the older people to all die off so it can be made legal. Its already decriminalized in some places like Massachusetts for example so its definitely on its way.|`|sYyNyjwuaa	I dont think what he did was right by any means, but its not fair how theyre making an example of him just because hes famous.|`|lDO4O2FXaa	wait wat happened to him???|`|9hC7bbf7aa	Well, fame attaches undesirable side effects. Especially as BIG as Phelps...pararazzi, oppotunistic photographers follow every step he takes unfortunately. And he got caught...Not a terrble crime for Joe or David, but for Michael ? yes. Unfair ? yes and no. Kellogg already dropped him.|`|AA11916020	YES!  He is a dope for doing dope!|`|CEl9V8Egaa	Yeah, because he's a dope for getting caught. Who cares what he does in private.|`|gM8MUde7aa	If you mean the ramifications of his getting caught smoking pot, then yes... I don't feel sorry for him. He made the choice to use an illegal drug... it's only fair that he pay the price.  Who cares how many people have smoked pot. If everybody decided to kill somebody, it's still just as illegal.    The fact that he became a role model after his astounding Olympic wins, only makes this worse. He should be held to a higher standard, and YES, he definitely SHOULD pay the price.|`|NE2XQK20aa	I think they are being very brutal.  I doubt everyone will ever realize how hard he worked to get where he is.  I see this as a phase, it's as simple as that.  He's young and I think everyone needs to get off his back.  People make mistakes, no ones perfect.|`|6cu3RwBcaa	No not everyone has smoked pot before. I'm one of the few who hasn't. But it isn't fair. Give the kid a break. He still is a role model. If your child experiments with it you CAN'T blame Phelps. I just hope it hasn't damaged his chances of participating in future olympic games. We've all made mistakes... as long as we learn from them.|`|iYDID6QRaa	I think as an American Hero, by that I mean his accomplishments in the Olympics, he should be held to a higher standard. I think that he is a representation of what makes America great. He worked hard maintained determination, and succeeded in taking the world Olympics by storm. Through those accomplishments he has made millions and millions of dollars through endorsements and his name alone carries a lot of weight. So yes he deserves to be held to a higher standard, he should hold himself responsible and make decisions that others can look up to. In this he should understand that the decisions he makes will have consequences, so he should have thought about the outcome before merely acting.    Now all of this said I do believe that people make mistakes and that they should be given second chances to redeem themselves, Which I think is why he is merely being suspended and is being treated like a grown man. So he needs to take it as it comes and then make changes to better himself so that he can make sounder decisions, By doing that he will regain respect and trust from the people that look up to him.
AA11488609	yes, but it's a big gamble.  The Celtics have three max contracts on their team with Pierce, Allen, and KG.|`|XwZZQbgCaa	Yes you can, but you have to find the right mix.    In Celtics case, it pays off with major salary investment on KG, Allen and Pierce.    In Lakers case, you feel great to have Kobe and Pau but a max money to Odom may be too favourable.    In Suns case, they are now shopping Amare coz things are getting terrible.     Anyway, it should be fun to watch LBJ-Bosh 1-2 punch......
VvYNeqcIaa	Well first of all where I was born and raised they play alot of hockey. The game is a way of life for me and my family.I've been playing the game since I was 7. My children play and even I still play now at 44. I remember though, as a kid my dad telling me of the great tradition of our city's NHL teams of the 1950's. They'd won 7 Stanley Cups up to that point. However at the time (late 70's and 80's) they were horrible the doormats of the NHL. As kids we'd get excited if they just made the playoffs, which was like one time in the 70's. Then in 1983 they drafted a young player from Peterbourough who later became the captain and from that moment on things started to build like a giant snow ball. They got better and better. Adding players. Making the playoffs almost every year. Still comming up short but you just knew someday they'd get it right and reach the summit. I remember the first finals the whole city was buzzing about hockey. It was on the radio, newspapers, and tv. Our team won the Presidents trophy and pretty much tore through everyone in their path all year long. For the first time in almost 40 plus years we had a shot at the cup! However, In the finals they fell apart and lost in 4 games. Devistating, it was a crushing defeat. You could feel it where ever you went in town. The playoffs are like a rollercoaster for fans and players alike. When they finnally won the cup a few years later you can't imagine the jubilation. Parades and parties with the cup and talk of 'can they do it next year?" The men on those teams are forever heros in your city. Every game your at the edge of your seat. You tend to hold your breath alot and bark at the tv. Yelling at the referee at the tiniest indescretion "Call the penalty!" It's been 25 years since that time in 1983 and my team has won 4 Stanley Cups in the last 11 years. Every one of them is special. They've made the playoffs now for over 17 strait years. That captain has retired and replaced with a new one. His number hangs in the rafters of our arena. The thing nobody can take away are the wonderful memories and when you go into that arena you can feel it. When you look up and see that number you remember and can't help but feel very proud. You look down on that ice and say to yourself thats where it happened. That's where history was made. I'd love to hear a Montreal fans perspective to your questions. Im very sure their answers and memories will be similar to mine. Your team will get there one day. Although im not a fan. I have alot of respect for them. They have an amazing core of young talent and I don't think dreaming and thinking about them winning the Stanley Cup is out of the realm of possibilities.|`|W88h5pfNaa	will do

WrDGhduxaa	it is necessary for a good long jumper to have sprint speed, spring, and body control.  Most have relatively long legs, but it is not really necessary.  High jumpers besides having speed, and very good body control also need up.  I have tried to coach several basket ball players who could dunk the ball, but could not get their bodies up in the air.  So a high jumper should be tall, since that gives them an advantage, along with their speed, spring, and body control to clear the bar.  Any technique event requires coordination.|`|rV60JrLhaa	in training do lots of jump rope
Cj75YFBmaa	Kojima.  You have the three backrow players in their defensive positions. So position 6 (deep) and the two "T"'s of the attack and sideline, have a setter and a hitter on the same side as the defensive players.  Start with a toss and have a player pass the ball.  Instead of catching the ball the setter sets it to the hitter who will continue to hit, tip, roll shot, or push the ball deep.    This drill is good to practice getting to your positions quickly and adjusting to the hitters shoulders and judging where the ball will end up.|`|kdgNIaoiaa	The three's drill. 3 people are in the 5,6, and 1 positions on one side of the court, then everyone else (mostly the setter and hitters) are on the other side of the court. they constantly spike at the 3 people on the other side.    another one is when 1 person goes through all the positions in the court, being constantly spiked on. usually the coach or a hitter is on the other side constantly hitting, aiming at the 5,6,1,2,3, and a dink on the 4th positions. the person digging has to work on reaction time and consistency.
d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	You are a bit confused my friend. Pit bikes are smaller than dirt bikes in general. If you are talking about tricking out a CRF50 or something like that with long travel suspension you are looking at a ton of money.

1jkAIJvYaa	yea, i think you'd have to talk to the coach, school or whatever. They need to know your going to be there.  But anyone can try out, doesn't mean you'll get playing time.  Talk to your counselor, they'll be able to help you out more than anyone here
SOveWKxkaa	I can't choose your topic, because I do not know you or you experiences. Choose on your own personal experience. Sometime in your life one of these subjects must have affected you.

by7BQ2npaa	I believe that since he chose to go for top, chose his path and chose to have a life of being a media figure, that he was foolish and ignorant.  Also, in plain sports career factors, it is  UNPROFESSIONAL.  I think it is also insensitive of him, especially now, since drugs and bad behaviour have been casting a shadow over sports and Olympic sports in the last decades.  This has hurt some of sports' credibility and trust from fans.  You'd think people/athletes would learn from all those scandals and most of all, gain some fear.  Once you do wrong, how can people trust you?  So they will (and should) naturally take a more closer look at you and your doping control to see if anything is going on.  As for endorsements, some should be lost or clearly reduce them or quiet them down. Sports is business as well, and irresponsibility and unprofessionalism are not cause for rewards, praise and attention.|`|w7o6qb9saa	Weed isn't bad at all, it's not like coke or crack or heroin!!!!

7f2GSDmqaa	Takers. HBK's long time haters I can understand because before he found religion in his life he was a total jackass backstage and played politics and used his power in the company to get what he wanted. But Undertaker never did that and was always professional, plus his gimmick is still very strong, while HBK seems to very slowly be losing it. He'll most likely be retiring in a few years.|`|6E16tR6xaa	Undertaker! I can understand HBK's because the whole sell out thing and the Montreal Screwejob. But Undertaker? No reason to hate. So Taker.|`|w173betxaa	Taker's because he never turned on anyone.|`|aULZ8D10aa	Taker's, he has alaways been a stand up dude, hbk did some corky stuff in his past. I think they hate taker because he is old. Taker still rules. I think some might be hogan fans, cause he beat hogan for the wwe title, not once, but twice. LOL Just kidding, but yeah too old is mine.|`|JTSNljLhaa	Im a fan of Taker but not a fan of HBK...he just not a honest person and a lier and not to mention arrogant..now days i guess im ok with him... now i dont dislike him or hate him|`|Gr7My8FTaa	TAKER!!!!|`|p7BjjPtNaa	HBKs. You are clearly a moron if you can't understand what not to hate about The Untertaker|`|2C8flYNcaa	Taker, because it makes no sense this guy has been goin hard, loyal, strong, and as the best every year and every event. This guy puts his body on the lines and he does for us the fans. HBK is deff similar to the undertaker but he wasnt so loyal relating to the montreal screwjob. Taker is the most loyal and hardworking wrestler and doesnt get recognized the way he should.|`|8wk1LhuXaa	Taker. They just hate him because they are scared.|`|fV9SawuPaa	Undertaker haters I don't understand at all. The guy is world class athelete, very talented in every aspect of being a professional wrestler. After nearly two whole decades he's STILL at the top of the ladder wrestling wise. He constantly reinvents himself and has probably one of the largest, if not the biggest, fanbase of all the wrestlers. Besides that Taker is a class act, very nice outside of wrestling. He helps push younger talent and is never selfish.    HBK haters I understand more. Shawn was very arrogant and vain in his younger days. He believed he was God's gift to wrestling. He held wrestlers down and caused Bret Hart to quit the WWE *essentially*. Although I'm a huge HBK fan, second only to Undertaker, his haters make much more sense. Undertaker haters make no sense at all.|`|EHK1RzpAaa	i find them both easy to understand. HBk screwed Bret Hart over, thats enough reason to hate him. and well Undertaker's gimmick is pretty old. i  mean seriously a "dead" man wearing make up n shooting lighting bolts, talking like he's some grim reaper that wrestles? however i do like biker taker

Anyway, it's a great card. But HHH doesn't need to fight for the title in WM for the 1000th time in a row. Instead, put him against Kane in the brand supremacy match. Then we can have a Edge vs Jeff vs Matt Triple Threat for the WWE Title. Maybe a TLC ? That would be great.|`|ZUTfMc8vaa	number ten|`|ZofcbEzvaa	Updated and still gay...huh...
i8soZLfRaa	I think they should have stuck with the old format until next year, and come up with something new  NEXT YEAR. There was nothing wrong with honoring "BUD" pole sitters, even if the this rear's pole sitter award goes to a new  beer sponsor. Last year's pole sitters, and previous winners should be rewarded for their efforts. A new rule change is a "slap in the face" to last rear's pole sitters, and a "horse punch " to previous winners.

Y4mz8BShaa	They should be included. I'm not a fan of D-Boys. Their internal quality is lacking when compared to other MPEG's, and I don't like anyone who manufactures LPEG's, but at least they have the courage to put them under the same name, even if it is slightly changed (BOYI). Great for cheap metal receivers, they're built to upgrade. Best selling point.    AirsoftMegastore, isn't a good retailer, be warned. They have a habit of listing false items, selling cheap AEG's with $5 accessories slapped on them as upgraded customs, and their website is full of information meant to try and sell products, not actual product information. Trying to pass off cheap LPEG's as high quality AEG's, for example.|`|EuhM8ngVaa	yea it's the last thing it says "package includes gun, battery, charger, mag" etc and no d-boys sucks. they're a hit or a miss company.

4YcZv0d7aa	I'm going to say John Cena. John Cena hasn't deserved a title shot since he got back after his surgery and filming of "12 Rounds". I mean seriously, he was added in at the end of the Royal Rumble and tossed HHH out. If it were anyone else, they would have been booed and turned into a heel, but no. Vince McMahon thought that since he went thru the pain of surgery and what not, he should become Champion "all of a sudden" without earning it. I'm tired of seeing John Cena as a Champion (especially after what he did to the WWE Championship Belt) and I really don't want to see Orton win it.|`|VQlrQ34Faa	ECW Champ Swagger  WWE champ Edge|`|6u2YkXjlaa	Swagger     Carlito & Primo too|`|E7TkNO00aa	Edge, he never plays fair.

You can drill holes for a scope mount with a drill press, but the hole would be more accurate and straighter with a milling machine. In a sport like shooting where accuracy is vitally important,  tolerances of manufacturing are measured in thousandths of an inch, and repetition is critical.   I have been selling cutting tools and abrasives to machine shops for 30 years, and the customers who use the best machines and tools produce the best results. I talked to a customer today that has a 30 year old Starrett micrometer. Every couple of years, he sends it in to have the calibration checked, and it still works like new. I wonder what the condition of the cheap Chinese tools will be like in 30 years?  Every shop I go to has specialized machines that spend most of their lifetime sitting idle, but when my customers need them, the machines prove their worth.

VwccuEFHaa	it would still take a hell of a bunt since it would have to be out of reach of the 1st baseman, 3rd baseman, and the catcher.  It also cant go right to Schilling because he would barely have to move.  It would be hard, way harder than you think.  Besides, pitching takes a lot of strength, Curt is no wuss.  He would run a mile with that ankle if it meant winning a world series.  Cardinals should have won that series, they had the better team, but they just didnt play like it.|`|eZanMO8vaa	oh please, schilling foot was fine. that was ketup on his ankle...|`|g9BURGo8aa	It's called baseball etiquette, the better team was going to win even without bunting to an injured player and that kind of thing. That not tony LaRussa's brand of baseball.    and also to touch on someone elses point, Varitek was a great fielder and it would have been difficult for a team like the Cards who werent a good bunting team, to not waste those ABs|`|42f3d6d73c3972f622efbb1789221c0baa	I can say the same for the Yankees in Game 6 of the ALCS !|`|gzRZlfpLaa	Got news for you, that Schilling bloody ankle thing was     ....... |....  ........|..........FAKE.............||...  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	It's been over 4 years don't you think it's time to let it go!|`|WUuO6wbAaa	Well, to start out, to place down a bunt perfectly requires in that position requires a degree of competence. A guy like Albert Pujuols so rarely does it, he may not know how to do it.    Here's the problem. When you bunt a ball for a hit, you want to push it on the third base line. Or drag it down the first base line. If it's dragged down the first base line, the 1B comes in (Youkilis) and the 2B (Bellhorn at the time) covers 1B for the throw. If the ball is bunted close enough to Schilling, even if it wasn't fake, he'd still be able to get off the mound and throw it. If that ball were in the middle, Varitek would have been able to throw out the runner. Or if you bunted in between 3B (Bill Mueller at the time - who was good defensively) and Schilling, Mueller could cover the extra ground. This scenario really only would have been a good option for a faster player like Edgar Renteria (Cardinals SS at the time and ironically the Red Sox SS the next season - who turned out to be a bust, like Lugo, I think Nomar's cursed them at his old position - I guess it compensates for the 2 WS titles).    As far as whether or not his ''bloody ankle'' was real or not, I think he had pain there, but they may have painted it. I don't know. The only one who would know is Schilling. Would he tell if it was a lie though? Maybe later on. Not any time soon though. It was just a story line. It was something overly exaggerated.|`|jKOB7n35aa	In 2004 they had Varitek, a great defensive catcher at a time, Bill Mueller, a great fielder too, at 3rd base, and Bellhorn at 2nd. Bunting would have been very difficult.
NNHzm4J2aa	1: I'm in favor and a fan of both the masked and unmasked kane. on both ends of masked and unmasked, he is one of the most dominating pro wrestlers in the WWE. his name from the past still represents him, which he is still the 'big red machine'. it's still the same gimmick, but just with different touches to it and which i'm still into to this day. both of them had it's advantages into the gimmick and storyline at the time. he was superb with the mask and still remains that way unmasked.    2: Everyone has their own opinions, but i think they think he's not 'destructive' anymore because of how they saw his debut and so on. he hasn't really changed because he still dominates that ring and still works hard to perform as usual. i also agree that he is getting better and better. the only thing that really changed after he became unmasked was that he actually has a voice and can help sell himself more to the viewers. he was still destructive with the unmasked kane. it's just that right now the way he's being used, the WWE fans are taking him 'lightly' when really kane is a great superstar and in my opinion, very underrated.    ?FAITH?|`|41WXZPnCaa	Masked Kane    Because It's A Real Monster|`|AA11480859	he just seemed more dominant in his masked days, more vicious, now every time you look around he getting beat, and that's on all three  shows whenever he was on one of them.|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	WQ1: Unmasked for me, his promos are fair better now you can see his expressions. selling a promo is just as much what you look like saying it as the words. In the ring very little has changed he is still the same intimidating monster only now he is deeply disturbed and has a look on his face like he wants to tear your limbs off. In the right feud Kane can have a huge impact, working with Rey didn't work like they wanted just didn't gel but Kane is still an amazing talent.    WQ2: i have no idea, i think it's like blaming PG for problems that go much deeper. It's easy to blame not having a mask for kane being a mid carder and a jobber than having to actually think about why he is in that position with the company. Some fans blame the easiest thing for problems which generally go much deeper.|`|JiCfYfLraa	i prefer unmasked because he is more dominating in my opinion. did you see him when he first became unmasked he was pure evil to the core im talking about unstoppable RAGE. a pure psychopath. burning jr,stomping shawn michaels throat with the steel chair,attacking shane mcmahon,tombstoned linda mcmahon,forcing lita to marry him(poor lita lol) and leaving superstars laid out backstage in a pool of blood. kane is one of the best wrestler and i hate how he is being used but he is ok with it but i dont know why because he is one of the most dominating superstars in wwe. he could be a dominating wwe champion but sadly the wwe wont give him the title. he was champion back in 1998 and only held it for a day like wtf kane is awesome. i like kane with or without his mask it doesnt make a difference. like you just said his mask doesnt wrestle for him.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	You said it perfectly. Props DONT make the wrestler. Kane is just as talented without the mask as he is with it. Me personally, I dont like masked wrestlers (aside from Mick Foleys Mankind gimmick, which I thought was genius) because I cant see their faces. I prefer unmasked Kane, to be honest. He looks more sadistic without the mask.|`|KIOR56r6aa	WQ1 : Makes Kane owns all!! Why? Cause he dominates with that mask!!    WQ2 : Nothing has changed? Sorry for saying this, Madison. But he's a jobber now and that changed a lot of things about him. I pretty much want him to pout his mask back.|`|6td3SnZGaa	Masked Kane without a doubt.   I think after Kane got unmasked he had the initial period of popularity then it died down and he lost fans.   The mask played a huge part in his character with it he was this hideous, scarred, crazy, mysterious looking man. Once they took that away the fans just seen him as this big, ugly, crazy man.   Thus losing popularity so the WWE basically didn't care as much for him which is why he gets all the rubbish storylines and has jobbed for so long.|`|P93I8CHtaa	masked,because he's scary like that    WQ2:i still respect him|`|Gr7My8FTaa	the masked kane was more dominent because unmasked kane sucks at the royal rumble and masked kane got 11!!! eliminations|`|oqzWvQhQaa	Anyone who thinks there is no difference between the Kane and Unmasked Kane is obviously not paying attention.  When Kane debuted back in 1997 with that mask he was unstoppable, he was an untouchable monster that only The Undertaker could defeat.  Look back to 1998 when Kane was easily going toe to toe with the likes of The Undertaker, Stone Cold, The Rock, Triple H... When Kane debuted he had enough heat and a big enough push that WWE was ready to give him the win over anyone and then you slowly begin to see the transformation of Kane, he begins to team with X-Pac and falls with Torrie and begins showing emotions and soon enough he starts jobbing to X-Pac, a few months later we see him lose the Intercontinental Title to figgin Rhino (Rhino ***** even get a win over Sylvan Grenier, whats that say about Kane)... Then Kane starts wearing that half-mask and loses almost very match until the day he loses his mask to Triple H.... And after a few months WWE realizes that they cannot do anything else with Kane because he is so plain that they have to make him a jobber again... They even had to bring in Festus to act as a Fake Old School Kane so that Kanes storylines could get some credibility.... This man used to go toe to toe with Stone Cold Steve Austin when he had that mask on...Now he can barely beat Chavo Guerrero... So when it comes to Kane Unmasked or Kane Masked.... You cannot say that Kanes mask didn't make Kane who he was...He was a burnt freak of nature that could destroy anyone on the roster...Now hes a big loser
1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	Well, the obvious, of course (awesome gimmicks and the believability of the two men portraying those characters).    The Undertaker has tweaked his gimmick a bit over the years.  But he has been doing The Undertaker character for nearly two decades.  The secret to this longevity is, I believe, not over-exposing the character.  He's not on TV every week in several segments (that's a big problem with Randy Orton, over-exposure).  He doesn't talk very much but when he does, we listen (sure, we pretty much know what he's going to say, but he doesn't say it often, so it's still interesting).  The Undertaker gimmick still works because of the old show business adage, "always leave 'em wanting more".  He's not on TV often and he leaves too soon.  We always look forward to his next appearance, whenever that is.    Kane, however, is a regular.  He's on TV every week, sometimes in several segments.  What makes the Kane gimmick still work after all these years is his unpredictability.  We never really know what to expect from him.  Is he face or heel this week?  Is he going to tag with such-and-such wrestler, or is he going to destroy him?  Is he stalking somebody this week?  Is he working FOR the GM this week, or is out to get him (or her)?  Will he wrestle a normal match or will he set somebody on fire?  The Kane gimmick doesn't get old (despite the frequency of his appearances) because we never know what to expect from him.|`|6u2YkXjlaa	I think it's because they can be versatile and it's hard to tell through the "mystery" of the personalities. I also think it has to do with Glen & Mark they themselves make the characters intriguing.       Undertaker|`|JiCfYfLraa	because there characters are unique it was never used before by any other superstar in wwe history. undertaker got the best award for that gimmick.    kane gimmick is better to me though especially when he was unmasked because it added more pop. he walked around like he was on a psychotic rampage when he was just attacking everybody backstage leaving them laid out in a pool of blood like what he did to rico,shawn michaels,jr and linda mcmahon.|`|J2bLQcHNaa	Good Gimmicks    BQ: Taker|`|KIOR56r6aa	Because they make people believe in their 'darkness'. And not to mention The Undertaker keep revolutionize his gimmick so people still love him.     BQ : Taker hands down!!|`|7f2GSDmqaa	They both have the ability to change their gimmicks with the times and adapt. Taker is a better example, as he dropped the Deadman gimmick when it was getting stale for a while, and returned from injury with the ABA gimmick. He showed a more human side and the gimmick was over. When that ran its course, he went back to the Deadman, which is still over today.    Same with Kane. When his masked gimmick ran its course somewhat, he changed his look. Unfortunately lately, many fans feel Kane need to go back to the mask, but I personally dont think so    The Undertaker (but I like Kane too)|`|jHjC95v2aa	they changed slightly over the years    undertaker i've been a fan for years|`|ptQ5SkPVaa	They make people explore their own darkside. Everyone likes to explore their darkside at some point. The Taker and Kane bring that out in people.    BQ: I like Kane|`|ZofcbEzvaa	Because they're legends  BQ: Taker|`|d403efcae775ea6e4ae5473282e93466aa	Plain and simple, they represent evil. Evil is timeless!

YPQTXOQ5aa	Who knows if he will be happy or not. Manny is a great player, but is it worth it to have a player that will go into a funk if his head is not screwed on right and take the team in the toilet with him.     Also, Manny is looking for a huge deal right now. He is going to be 38 and can he still play the outfield in a decent manner. I would take him on a two year deal with a team option for a third. But his agent will reject it.|`|sHzPnGXHaa	why not barry bonds|`|fQIxah8laa	Because the Mets ownership don't like to give the fans what they want.  Sad unfortunately.|`|fKAnnQeWaa	What I really want to know is who is Manny Rameriez? Is he a far relative of the great Slugger Manny Ramirez?    I have 2 things to say to you  1- Learn to spell, there are over 15 Ramirez named players in the MLB alone. You should have been able to see their names long enough to be able to spell it.    2- Get with the times! Omar Minaya has stated over 4 times that he is not after Manny.    You know what, to find a better answer to this just check 65% of all the previously asked questions. I can guarantee you that they involve Manny in some way.|`|e2xwOLFSaa	For the same reason that nobody seems to want him.  He is capable of ripping your ball club apart if he gets unhappy, and no one wants to put out the money he is demanding.  There are good reasons for why Manny remains unsigned.  Eventually though some team will give in and offer him the deal he wants.  I don't see it being the Mets though.  They have already spent a lot of money in the offseason and are worried about their pitching, not their batting.|`|2wgEsVmsaa	Manny Ramirez is not only the best post-season player of all time, he whomped on NL pitching in a VERY short time. His NL totals look like some players' full time seasons. He is fun to watch and can carry a team all alone for a week. A lot of teams will regret not giving him a look. You don't have to like him, but look at the record. And the Mets sure could use his September skills to get to October, when he is, as I said, the best player ever. People who talk about his baggage and then wonder why their team just missed the playoffs sound smart now (maybe!) but in October there is a better than even chance that Manny and his team will be in it.|`|vweoheAvaa	The Mets don't want the baggage that comes with Ramirez, the same reason that no team signed Barry Bonds last year.|`|x5ZaTKF8aa	The Mets' ownership is inept. The whole front office is a fraud. They have never given the fans what they needed. Sometimes I forget that the team is located in New York City. Omar Minaya's hands are tied. If he had his way, Ramirez would be there. The clueless Wilpon family now is going to blame everything on being ripped off but what about the last seven years? No big acquisitions.

mG2BCZe7aa	1. 1962-63 Boston Celtics team that featured Sam Jones, Clyde Lovellette, K.C. Jones, Frank Ramsey, Bob Cousy, John Havlicek, Bill Russell, Tom Heinsohn on the same team. Imagine a team having 8 HOF players in it's roster.    2. 1995-96 Chicago Bulls. Michael Jordan's triumphant re-entry to the top. Same team that broke win records previously held by...    3. 1971-72 LA Lakers. 33- wins enroute to the title, only title in Wilt Chamberlain's Laker reign. It is interesting to note that the 33 win streak started after Elgin Baylor retired.    4. 1986-87 LA Lakers This Laker team presented "Showtime" at its finest and perfectly displayed that in the playoffs. This is perhaps the most balanced roster of all time. You have the ultimate floor leader in Magic Johnson, the ultimate finisher in "Big Game" James Worthy, the ultimate scorer in Kareem, the ultimate outside threat in Byron Scott, and the ultimate defender in Michael Cooper, who won defensive player of the year.    5. 1990-91 Chiacago Bulls. This was the team that enables Jordan to seize the top, ending years of play-off frustration against Detroit plus this proved to be a significant passing of the torch as they faced Magic Johnson's Lakers another test for the would be NBA conqueror's for the next 8 years.    Honorable mention:    1985-86 Boston Celtics. This was perhaps the best and most consistent team the Celtics fielded during the Larry Bird era. Larry Bird was in his prime averaging 26 ppg, 10 rpg, and 7 apg. McHale averaged 21, Parish and DJ averaged 16, and Ainge averaged 11 on mostly three pointers. Plus they had Bill Walton off the bench, who gave them huge minutes. This team was balanced all the way around but what made them great was their knack for hustling, superb defense, and ability to put teams away when they were down. Only a few teams in history struck as much fear in their opponents as the 1986 Celtics.        Hope this helps.|`|IZ3tNmpyaa	Im Just gonna talk about the teams I have had the pleasure of watching.    1 1987-88 Lakers (showtime Lakers)  2 96 Bulls  3 86 Celtics  4 83 Sixers ( Dr. J, Andrew Toney, Cheeks, Bobby Jones, Moses)  5 99 Spurs and 95 Rockets (tied)|`|ZJMrbCysaa	cant name 5 but would this count  1992 Dream Team
1jkAIJvYaa	Remember to catch the ball at it's highest point.  Attack it, put yourself in better position than the CB.  Look at it this way, once the QB throws it, its your job to get to it. Just focus on the ball, nothing else.  The most important thing is the ball.  And you have to catch it first before you can run with it.  A lot of receivers want to run with the ball before they actually have it.  I tell them you can't score without the ball, one thing at a time.  Catch it first, then run.  Stay Focused.      Some exercises/drills that you can do is take a NFL size ball or something bigger than what you would use.  Hold your arm out, with your palm faced down.  Let the football go (drop the ball), but catch it with the same hand before it hits the ground. Use only one hand.  You should actually try to catch it as soon as you release it.  Do it quick, over and over again.   Switch hands too. It'll get your fingers/hands stronger and you'll really get a good feel of the ball too.  Another thing you can do is fingertip push-ups. Use just your fingers, palms off the floor.  If its too hard on you fingers go to your knees, you don't want to hurt yourself. Remember, your working you fingers not your arms. No big deal to go to your knees for this.  Also, as simple as it sounds. While you watch tv, lay down and throw the football in the air and catch it.  If that's too easy, catch it with only one hand, but don't smash your face!!! Good luck man.|`|67f5e5eaa58c08684e5ed41cad4360eeaa	keep a ball with u at all time and toss it around and practice on forming ur hands in a diamond it works for and i play sophmore|`|AA10670663	practice running slants and post or routes that go across the quarterbacks Vision wen u with ur friends. if you are by yourself throw the ball in the air like a punt return and run with it|`|bJ61uKFEaa	Catching on the run you just cant take your eye off the ball, people look what's ahead of them if there running an "in" route or something all the time, because there afraid they will get hit, but a good WR knows he will get hit every play and always focus on catching the ball, just watch it into your hands, then worry about getting somewhere with it, and if you get hit hard, then you get hit hard, its part of the game. As for jumping for high passes, just do a bunch of.. well... "catching the ball up high" drills, and for better hands, just do typical WR drills.    Hope this helps. Good Luck!|`|u7GBP579aa	you can practice at home, throwing the ball behind you and catching, or get with a friend and just run routes.

q4YGEjS4aa	Your coach sees your hussle, wants to let you know he (just assuming) sees it and wants to you to be encouraged to keep working.  Sounds like he has plans for you.  Maybe not right away like this season but next.    Best thing you can do is ask your coach what he wants to you do on the team.  Be a hitter for ave. power, bunter, basestealer, defense oriented.  You can focus on improving that faster.  You'll probably see more playing time that way.  Now don't forget to get better in other parts of the game,  just find your niche.   Mine was to be a shut down closer in college.  I love being a starting pitcher but I got much more innings in as our closer.  Because of the extra innings logged I also worked back into the starting lineup when I wasn't over worked as a closer or if our starters were taxed too much.|`|kCwhs8Reaa	It means that he notices that you are working hard and whatever you are doing has caused you to improve your skills.

xOReEw6Waa	I've used the laser bore sighting systems a few times and in reality you don't need them. Start your sighting in at 50 yards with a good size target. Try to line up the scope and the bore (remove the bolt) by just sighting down both and getting them close. Take a shot, adjust at the 50 yards till you are 2.5 inches above the zero. Move the target to 100 yards and you should be trying to get 1.75 inch above the zero, then you should be right on at 200 yards with a centerfire rifle. 22LR are similar, only you start at 25 yards and then go to 50, then 100.|`|dfBwVxXFaa	falconry said it, I don't know how many time you change your scope, but you will not need to bore sight every time you shoot, so a bore sighter is not used very often. if you want to bore sight take it to a dealer or smith, and they will do it for about $10. Save your $$|`|h2KkiKK3aa	don't get a laser one, really unreliable, get a real, scope style one, lasers can shift due to eye angle, scope style ones don't.

Don't worry about being a fan of the visiting team, it's common at spring training, and in general the fans there are fans of the game of baseball.  Since it doesn't really matter who wins, there's no really any animosity in the stands.    Fans in the stands often tend to interact about where they are from, and there baseball experiences.  Its a friendly crowd.    The players are usually more relaxed and sometimes even interact with the fans sitting near the on-deck circles or near the bullpens during the games.    I recommend you get there early.  Gates usually open at least two hours before first pitch.  Most likely some players will be giving autographs.  You might also want to take the opportunity to walk around the practice areas, depending on what site you are attending,  to see what was going on.    I've seen the stadium in Tempe, where the Angels train, but never attended a game there.  The stadium is on the complex with their training facility.  Since you aren't an Angels fan, you may not be that interested in exploring the facility.    Here are some links that you might find interesting.  http://www.springtrainingconnection.com/...   http://www.cactus-league.com/fields/ange...     http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...|`|P1bO87l1aa	Its very relaxed and most parks are smaller so you are closer to the field.  In 2006 I went to a Cardinals vs Braves game at the Braves home field at Disney World.  I saw more Cardinal hats and shirts than for the Braves.  Real baseball fans don't care what teams attire you wear as long as you show good sportsmanship at the game.|`|oyq0vrWNaa	Well, first of all, the games are obviously not as enthusiastic or crowded as regular/post season games.  Plus, many of the better players are sitting out to prevent injury.  So, you're more likely to see backup players.    Either way though, you can get very good seats for cheap prices, so it's worth it.|`|urATrIHraa	There's no better feeling that attending a spring training game!  When the temperature is 70 degrees in comparison to 20 degrees back home, how can anything beat that?  It's the sign of a fresh start and a renewed hope that this year could be our year!  The experience at spring training game is very interactive between fans and players alike.  Everybody is having a good time and nobody takes things too seriously so don't worry about wearing your team's apparel on the road.  Plenty of fans travel with the team for their away games so you won't be alone. Have fun and prepare to have the time of your life!|`|6KIsnVB6aa	spring training is the best experience a baseball fan can honestly get. i would honestly say that pretty hardcore people go to the spring training games, unless its people that live around the area type of a thing. i went to other fields that the chicago white sox played at and i wore my sox stuff and it was totally fine.    have fun at spring training. i'm totally jealous. i've been going for about the past four years and this year we aren't going because we went to the rosebowl game. :( have fun!! the players actually have a conversation with you and stuff, its fabulous.|`|frrFZTxhaa	I am in agreement with most of what everyone else has already said. It is a good cheap way to see your team. The best time to goto a spring training game is in the last week of spring training. The starters will be playing more often than not because they want the team to be gelling when the season starts.  Bring a pen, and some balls, and a young kid or hot girl and you can get all the autographs you want if you get there early enough.
iO12Vjnvaa	LOL! Didn't notice any of it....but it could be the "girly" thing.    So I am guessing that :  Jimmie's unhappy  Wendy is very happy  Tony's using OLD SPICE products and making room for all the Whoppers he'll devour this year  Jeff Gordon must have just back from cosmetic surgery  Kyle and those blasted M&M'S....Joe told him to cut back!      Just an opinion as always with my tongue in my cheek. Lol.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	Perhaps Tony left his extra lbs. in his JGR locker and Kyle stumbled upon them and thought, hey....I could use a few of these.

I didn't notice Wendy.    TONY WAS HOT!!!  OMG all clean shaven even though I like a bit of scruff he looked so good...lost a bit of weight (but not too awfully much thankfully) and just looked wonderful.  Jeff Gordon looked great as always.  yeah he looked younger...its the happiness in his life with his wife and baby girl.  Kyle did put on a few pounds and filled out some...he is losing that young kid look and filling out like a man.  Though I wouldn't term him as "hot" he certainly is looking better.   I did notice Elliot's wedding ring and then he spoke of his marriage which confirmed the news and my heart broke all over again.  LOL|`|vIcOdePzaa	I noticed all of that too. And did you notice the look on Jimmie's face when Kyle was picking his bottle and talking about him, Jimmie did not look impressed.

Jimmie's wedding ring is on the finger right next to the injured one so he probably couldnt wear it (at least not comfortable). But you are right he didn't wear it. I'm sure he will when his finger heals though.  2. I didn't notice Wendy (didnt see the draw)  3. Tony is about 3/4 shaven and did seem to lose some weight.  4. I think Ella keeps Jeff young chasing her now lol so I guess so.  5. Kyle sorta It's hard to tell.|`|Ek1x32WHaa	JJ has not worn his ring since he cut his finger.

I think you should make the move for ak-47, he'll help you in every catergory.  I'd keep Miller too, he's finally starting to play better.  But yea, think about who to drop, but pick up AK-47
a268bbf5f7d7d4bbb6f43d11ccd29916aa	Take it easy there gentlemen.  Not everyone has had the benefit of being schooled in wing-shooting.  You both had good teachers along the way, but now it's your turn to teach, so turn down the acrimony and do the job properly.  TaylorTim, it's considered unsportsmanlike to shoot most any bird when it is on the ground or roosting.  A couple exceptions come to mind:  turkeys, when they are being called in and a wounded bird--especially one  failed to kill cleanly.  Which brings up the second reason you have drawn fire from Bob and Haveaseat:  shooting at a flock to knock down the greatest number of birds.  There was a time when 'market hunters' would mount a huge gun on a boat, sneak up on a floating flock and blast them to hell and gone.  This, and other unsavory practices, led to a decline in the game population to alarming levels.  Today we have licensing, game tags, hunting seasons,  and limits on the method used and number taken--all done to control the harvest and ensure responsible management of the game resource.  This falls under the general heading of conservation.  The limits are there to protect the resource.  If you try to side-step the limits by wasting game (leaving game in the field without a scrupulous effort to retrieve) you not only do something unethical, you also break the law.  If you are careless about aiming, you will wound birds rather than kill them and could easily excede the limit unintentionally.  A wounded bird should count toward your limit, but how will you count it if you have struck so many birds with a single shot?  The whole point of wing-shooting is to take game cleanly and skillfully.  There is no skill in just killing.  You could do that with poison.  Personally, I don't take shots at flocks.  If I did, I would go after the straggler, selecting a single bird and I'd bloody well make sure the others were clear.  OK.  That's enough for now.  As far as the question goes, I prefer a 20 ga for dove.  They're not big birds and the breasts are about all there is to eat.  My skill level is comfortable with the 20.  If I were better, I might buy a 410.   7s are about ideal, but I can't always find them, so I'll shoot  6 or  8.  I usually am a pass shooter for dove, although I have tried flushing without a dog and that has been OK.  My best advice is, shoot when you're sure and let the rest go for next time.  It's not a contest.  There's no prize beyond what you take home with you--and it's not found in your game bag.  Sorry, I forgot you mentioned choke.  I use a full choke to keep the pattern tight and give the 20 a little range.|`|PRihWRTIaa	12 bore gun is good and   7 is best for dove or for other smaller birds as  7 have more pellets in a cartridge which can go far with high velocity due to it's small surface area and spread to a large area.|`|caecd9e3d614f2b68ccbea2108f571efaa	I'm guessing that you never read " A Sand County Almanac" by Aldo Leopold.    Who the he!! is teaching you about hunting!  You don't just walk up to a flock of birds and spray at them. Ground swatting a dove is unethical to begin with, and flock shooters are not even considered hunters. I don't know why you weren't taught ethics by your parents.|`|gnRiLwSxaa	I use a 12 gauge and 7 1/2 shot.   You don't really intend to shoot a group of them on the ground, do you?    A 20 gauge or 16 gauge will also work, of course.|`|c474fd81caa3e43b78b2c3cb23eb0a39aa	Accurate shootin, mostly.    A 12 gauge would put the most lead in the air.  8 or 9 shot.|`|5XHnuDL1aa	I have the best luck with a 12 ga. under a variety of conditions.  I use  6 or  71/2 shot.  a 12 ga. puts more pellets in the air.  the slightly larger shot size retains its velocity further down range adn takes less   pellets on target to make a kill.  Dove don't always flush close to you.  Often quite a ways away and they take off faster than quail.  I use a modified choke to have good results under both near and far target conditions.|`|OBh7uEd1aa	really hate to answer but pot shooter is generly refunded their money here ,,an told to get hell off place  ,, in rather ugly  tone  no reason quail or doves  ducks should be pot shot,, go buy a chicken

I bought my first 30-06 when I was 14 and haven't been without one since. You would be near equal with a .308.   I think the Howas are a great gun. I almost bought a Stainless / Laminate 270 WSM for only $400.   If you are deer hunting are just shooting you would do well with the 25-06, 270, or the 7mm-08. The 6.5 x 55 Swede Mauser is a very sweet cartridge-bullet combination that will take moose. I like the 30-06 because it does well for deer,elk,bear, moose. The 06 can be loaded with bullets from 120 grains to 220 grains. I like the 165 BONDED bullets because it will work great on everything.|`|QrjuueMCaa	Howa is a great rifle. If you are going to shoot anything more than prairie dogs or other small game, get something bigger than the .223. It is a great small game round, but can be a bit small for bigger game like whitetails. If you want to stay on the smaller and faster side, go with a .243 or comparable. If you want bigger, head towards the mid 30 calibers like the .308 or 30-06, maybe even up to the .300 win mag. Just depends what you want to shoot. Good luck to you!    Lock and load. Keep your powder dry!|`|YrxLbfiIaa	If you will be target shooting then consider one chambered in .223 -- The .223 is quite similar to the 5.56x45MM your service rifle fired....

If you prefer something more practical all-around, plinking, target, hunting- I suggest a military surplus bolt action rifle. Or a cheap semiautomatic like the SKS or a Saiga rifle. Most mil surp bolt actions are very durable, tested designs, like the Lee Enfield, Springfield, Mauser or Mosin Nagant. all have been involved in both world wars and numerous smaller conflicts. Some can still be seen today in various conflicts around the world. The Mauser or Mosin Nagant rifles are the most popular of choices, the Mosin cheap and simple, the Mauser accurate and reliable. Both have a good deal more recoil than the M16, similar to that of a shotgun. Great rifles for a beginner though, especially teaching the basics of proper shouldering, use of iron sights. A scope can be mounted on later on for target shooting. Both the Mauser and Mosin Nagant have effective ranges of about 500 yards and will shoot to about 800 yards.|`|a268bbf5f7d7d4bbb6f43d11ccd29916aa	.308 in the true short action M1500.

yF9FaHX0aa	Money in the Bank: This match could be very intresting because Evan Bourne is very fast and agile Mr Kennedy has many experience in this type of matches CM Punk has experience too Shelton Benjamin makes the match much better Gregory Helms fights well because he reutrned with many expierence and he has a very good finisher and The Brian Kendrick is fast and very intelligent.    Rey Mysterio vs Mike Knox: This match wouldn't be interesting because this type of matches should have a big rivalry and Rey Mysterio and Mike Knox...well they don't hate each other enough to have a big rivalry.    Trish Stratus vs Natalya: They aren't very agressive fighting but they are agressive yelling so it would be good that they put all that hate they have against each other fighting in the ring    Beth Phoenix vs Rosa Mendez: For sure it would be good they see each other in the ring at Wrestlemania 25 but they are fighting because they both love Santino but he is a F******* that cheats everyone so Rosa Mendez iwill make that effort just for nothing.    Matt Hardy vs Jeff Hardy: If you are putting this match because Matt costd the WWE title I don't think so because they are brothers and they can fix it talking or not but it's a very nice match to see.    Steve Austin vs Chris Jericho: It would be awesome but as I said this type of matches should have a big rivalry and these two men don't have a rivalry it's like putting Finlay against Kane in the Main Event Match they don't have a rivalry Jericho and Stone Cold neither BUT as I like both this match would one of bests.    Triple H vs Kozlov: This would be a very good match Kozlov is a great fighter but he is not UNDEAFEATED he is UNPINNED and Triple H is a great fighter and they both have a big rivalry.    Shawn Michaels vs The Undertaker: Yes Ilove when the Undertaker faces Shawn Michaels I loved the 2007 Royal Rumble when they both stayed in the ring at last this would be the match of the year.    Tommy Dreamer vs Jack Swagger: Tommy Dreamer is a very experienced fighter and Swagger it's new so I like this match because dreamer will have revenge against Jack Swagger but I want Tommy Dreamer to win that's why I would like to do this match a Hardcore match.    Edge vs Christian: A great match brother vs brother for the WWE titlethey both are very experienced but I would like Edge and Christian to be again in the brood with Gangrel that would be good but this match will be great.    Randy Orton vs John Cena: If The Undertaaker vs Shawn Michaels wasn't the best this for sure it is Randy Orton now for me the best is doing great WWE winning the Royal Rumble and that group he has "The Legacy" is great and John Cena is the WH Champion  this match I would like to change it to a TLC match.|`|94UNuQ4Faa	lol! yeah, you do have too many matches!

AA11018573	"Qualifications needed:   There are different qualification for the various levels of umpiring, starting with the C league and progressing to the B and A leagues.    Where to train: The Umpires' Association offers training and sets the exams, starting with the local umpiring course. After completing exams, you would umpire club games in the C league, before progressing to the B and A leagues. The umpire is monitored by both captains and assessed by the Umpires Association. Once you are an established A league umpire, you will be allocated to umpire various 'cricket weeks' around the country before writing national exams that would enable you to umpire provincial games. Umpires are monitored at provincial level before progressing to national level."|`|PwHQSAxvaa	Take a course with the association of cricket umpires.

AA10297143	First, I assume you mean the $5000 a year parochial school has the big name coach, but unless you have the talent, that doesn't rub off as giving anyone an edge to make the big leagues.  There is more involved here, such as what can your parents afford, what is in the best interest overall, and yes, I have not heard of even a private school with only 200 students for the entire four grades of high school.  That is very prestigious indeed.  By the way, not from Wisconcin, so what is D-1 or D-2 since most schools like UW in the Big Ten are A level schools?  If you are that good after getting this coach's personal training, why not qualify for higher?  Just curious.|`|ZaYyXiJAaa	Hmm. In a Private school, you will definitely get a better education, but public schools provide needed social skills and prepare you for college size classes, maybe even more, but if you're bringing sports into the equation, you should be really positive that coaches are going to look at you if you want to sacrifice some valuable people skills.|`|3789578fd8856931c78aaa9516f5197eaa	public schools suck

Cl6KbcAGaa	Yes we can but we need to know first where or what Dept. store did you buy this bike at? and If it is a Dept store bike....just take it back! If you bought it second hand then you either have a worn cassette, chain, bent rear wheel, front derailleur and rear is out of alignment or and number of other things. It is not easy to diagnose your problem accurately without seeing it up close and personal so I suggest you take it to you local bike shop and let them do it. EDIT: yes you have a dept store bike no wonder you have a problem with it....take it back to the store and get your money back then Never again buy a bike shaped object from Target, Wal Mart, or K-Mart ever again ! Only buy a bike from a store that sells ONLY bikes! These dept store bikes are such a pain in the     to fix they are just not worth the time and effort and cost to the owner. buy right the first time and you will not have these problems.

XrCc85kNaa	WTF???    No...
AA10107142	your question isn't terribly clear so your going to get 2 answers.  from your question it seems as though you might not understand that .22lr and .22wmr (commonly called .22mag) are 2 different rounds and are not interchangeable.        No the lead shot and plastic head on it will not harm the barrel.  both are softer than the steel the barrel is made of and softer than the copper plated lead bullets typically found in rim fires, worst case they are as hard as a lead bullet, but lacking the mass that engages the riflings they are putting even less stress on the barrel.  if your worried about lead build up then just clean your barrel. honestly I rarely clean my .22 rim fires, its somewhat pointless as rim fires are dirty and unlike center fires aren't as accurate when clean.    now if your trying to chamber a .22mag (WMR) shot shell in rifle that is chambered in .22lr then you run the chance of damaging the chamber and ruining the rifles accuracy, basically the longer .22wmr shell will impact the end of the chamber where the rifling begins, if this area is damaged you'll need to either have the head space redone (if its even possible) or get a new barrel (likely the cheaper route).  this is why many .22lr with match grade (or bentz) chambers say not to use cci stingers (although cci stingers are .22lr they use a longer shell and shorter bullet to add power and velocity).  most likely you won't even be able to get the bolt  closed especially on a semi-auto like the 10/22.  basically you need to stick with what the gun is chambered for, if you have a .22lr then get the .22lr shot shells and .22wmr shot shells for .22wmr chambers.      if you haven't used those shot shells before they are pretty much useless over 10ft, even the ones chambered for 9mm,.40s&w,.45acp don't do much past 15-20ft.  sure they might kill a snake right next you but I wouldn't want to go after birds with them, and if I did have to kill a snake with a rimfire I'd rather have a solid bullet.  not to mention that they don't always cycle semi-autos.|`|lmWqwpygaa	no-not as long as your gun has a mag barrel.|`|EGe0k8P6aa	Based on my experience with them, provided you shoot the shells in a gun chambered for .22 WMR (or use the .22 LR version in a gun chambered for .22 LR) it won't damage the barrel of your firearm. .22 shot shells are designed to be used in .22s. That said there are some issues with them.    (1. .22 shot shells can cause leading in the barrel, however leading does not damage your barrel. It just degrades accuracy a bit until its removed. These deposits of lead are removed with a thorough cleaning using a wire brush, solvents, patches and a good bit of patience.    (2. .22 shot shells are extremely short range. Think 15-20 feet on snakes or rats. That's not just because the extremely small size shot looses its energy quickly. It also has to do with the shot pattern expanding extremely rapidly due to the rifling deforming shot.    (3. .22 shot shells won't generate enough energy to cycle a .22 semi-automatic.|`|4iZozOw4aa	probably|`|542afa43b449f37492e87e0c2820af61aa	Yes I know the .22 shot shell you are talking about. They call them rat shot here. I believe that they will reduce barrel life if used constantly. The shot goes straight down the barrel and is not protected by a wad like in a proper shotgun.|`|GGDPbT8taa	If I remember correctly, the casing around the pellets is plastic, so it should not damage the inside of the barrel, though it may take a bit to clean it out.  They make both magnum and standard loads for the shotshells, make sure your rifles is a .22 mag and it should not have a problem... I would not personally fire a magnum load through a standard rifle because it will expand the chamber and possibly damage the mechanism.  Good luck!|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	* No it won't do any damage.*~~|`|pXtz73Iwaa	I have shot plenty over the years and they have not hurt anything.  also Marlin makes or made a smooth bore .22 I think its called the Garden Gun.

I'm going to stick my neck out and choose BO McGINTY over your choice Canadian Danehill today scally he was well ahead of him LTO and I think he has the beating of him today.    Really like the look of Calzaghe and being by Galileo looks like Dandy Nichols has got himself another shrewd purchase but why has he put him in a Seller? any thoughts.

PCn6WTGyaa	he looked good...but lets not overstep our bounds here...He fought stephan bonnar.  Bonnar is a decent fighter, but he is hardly one of hte elites in the UFC.  He is on the fast track to becoming a "gatekeeper."    Jones has to beat someone with serious talent before we even begin to consider him as a great fighter within his division.|`|UWJinEbIaa	Let's see how he does against other "name" fighters like Brandon Vera or Rich Franklin before we proclaim him to be the next unstoppable champion.  His wrestling and unorthodox strikes has made an impact in the company but let's not praise him too much or he might fade away like Jon Fitch.|`|FUQ0sJNaaa	Shelton Benjamin vs. Bones would make one hella fight.    Hey, you can't deny it!      Well, we have to see more of him. Bones fought a shell of Bonnar who honestly was never that good. I still see tons of potential in the guy, but he might be wreckless.|`|g7xaB57Xaa	Jones did a good thing by publicizing his training right when he was supposed to start having fun in Vegas.  He beat Bonnar, and that isn't an amazing feat, but a superb feat to keep your feet in the UFC.  If he is to become a champ, he better just work on his reflexes and striking accuracy and he should have a great test in someone like Matt Hamill in no time.|`|3Z9npp2maa	Give him 9 years and he'll be great. He just needs to keep working on that striking and on his cardio.|`|ZUTfMc8vaa	i guess|`|NJMzhcKhaa	2 more years, extensive conditional training and he will be gold.    He is very promising for such a young fighter.|`|SM6qHDKeaa	i don't know about the next anderson silva, but if he's not careful he'll end up being the next vitor belfort. he looked really good, but he still needs lots of work. hopefully he won't have to fight too many top level opponents just yet while he builds his skill and experience, and in a few years we'll see where he's at|`|sLVGdCOTaa	Ahhh No, but he looked very impressive against an albeit rusty but always game Bonnar.

qbWplwXdaa	Usually it is easier to start trying 3's toeside. Cut out about 15-20ft. and approach the wake with a nice progressive edge ( start edging slowly towards the wake and progressively edge harder edging hardest at the top of the wake). A trick that helps a lot of people when they are first trying 3's is to pull the handle to your back hip fairly hard as you leave the wake. When in the air lead your rotation with your head. You should have slack in the rope from pulling it in off the wake which makes the handle pass a lot easier. The rotation is very easy, so I can't tell you enough to worry about completing the handle pass. It helps to practice on land or trampoline. You might feel dumb but no one will be laughing when you go stick on the water. Good Luck!
wS1ePD8haa	i would return it.  With the lower flex you will probably break the stick sooner than later and the extra length really is necessary.  I am the same size and wouldn't dream of using anything shorter than a senior, especially when you are paying the money for a stick like the s17.|`|4WMEAsxxaa	the flex on the s17 is lower then what is actually listed. a 100 flex feels like an 85, 75 like a 65 and so on. i would even go with a 100 if i were you.|`|w4DIPHf1aa	A 100 is harder to break than an 85    OMG take it back, that thing will be a noodle.......      It's meant for a 80 pound kid.    A stick that flexs too much to you will feel akward, if you like the flex on your feet then you will hate it on the ice as you lean more on it then.    If your a novice an 85 will work well but remember any shot is 80% technique and 20% the stick    I prefer 100's and i"m not a big guy at all but if your learning to take a a hard shot it won't give the feel you want.      good luck with your slap shot....remember its all in the hip turn.|`|axxQzOCHaa	definately trade it for the 85|`|aIXeSThOaa	if they let you return it then you should a sticks flex gets softer the more you use it it maybe 65 now but in a couple of months it'll be 50 or so assuming it lasts that long

It must be close to the line and must be fast. Doing an ace isnt a concern though... i would first worry about actually having a good serve in general that can give one an advantage early in the point.

He wasn't smoking or doing any drugs during the Olympics so what's the big deal? Every time the press gets a story, they have to blow it all out of proportion. Let one of them do something and it's shoved under the table and not talked about. So he smoked POT   BIG WHOPPING DEAL|`|DEDmq2OWaa	Hmmm he is young- if I were in his shoes- a bit stressed.

I know, I know, all of those damn pot heads out there knocking over convenient stores, robbing old people, and killing people to get a joint or bong hit are whats wrong with this country. What the f@ck ever, that is a joke!     Its people that are to stupid to realize that pot is not a bad thing and that alcohol is way worse are a big part of what is wrong with this world!    Pot should be legalized A.S.A.P..|`|C5OfG88Waa	he's a typical 20 something year old who just wanted to relax and blow of some steam. as far as i'm concerned, if he wasn't out doing crazy things like running people over or stealing or firing a gun then it shouldn't matter too much. its just like drinking. as long as you're responsible and ready to suffer the consequences, whatever. deal with the hangover. and he has accepted the consequences. he says it was regrettable (which now that its a big deal, it is) and that he's sorry. he's just a guy who experimented with drugs which is key to getting drug education (just self educating)
8zgFyfibaa	Well the only thing I heard was after the sub-17 world cup. Clubs from sweden,spain and italy wanted him. But cruz azul dint want to sell him.

But the only team I think he has a good possibility is Almeria, the team that Hugo Sanchez is coaching. Simply because his style of play is very offensive and Villaluz plays very offensively so he might fit in very well to Hugo's style of play.|`|XvjXrCffaa	lmao  wikipedia isnt reliable  i remember someone here said that they can put that German Villa was going to Barcelona    haha i lmao at that one|`|Zf1jiJoiaa	i haven't heard nothing like that, dont believe in wiki.|`|QyZiTk6Xaa	i hope so for mexico.. but i hope not for cruz azul. we need another championship and hes a great help.|`|6uc8ROfWaa	wiki sucks|`|aGpr0Qg5aa	wikipedia? jaja ppl be messin around with that|`|JiKNOtvdaa	Don't believe Wiki, it's not even helpful|`|XSBNv0iOaa	I saw that too  Last year.

vhcyobsJaa	Basically do any cardio you can so that when you do get back on the erg you're not huffin and puffin. Maybe you could do a stagnant bike... or would that bug your ankle too?    Also, Just some basic calisthenics to keep your muscles up to par like pushups, situps, squats, leg lifts, supermans... ect.     also stretch as much as you can so that you're not all tight when you start rowing again.|`|Cdkd4oQ7aa	Can you use a stationary bike? If you can use a stationary bike (or a normal bike), you should try that. Alternate biking as hard as you can with a rest period. You can basically set it up like you're doing erg pieces, and use the RPMs on the bike the same way you'd use your splits on an erg (except instead of trying to keep your splits low for the harder parts, you'd try to get higher RPMs for the harder parts). Obviously you have to experiment to get the right numbers for your own body.     Also, the downside is, with an erg, you're working your entire body, where as with the bike you'd be working mostly your legs and butt. It's not going to be the same. You should try to work your upper body additionally, especially focusing on your core. You should try to get time in for your abs and lower back, if nothing else. Despite what everyone tries to say, crunches/sit-ups aren't actually practical. Try this instead:    If you have access to a pull-up bar - hang from the pull-up bar, arms straight, so that your feet don't touch the ground. Let yourself dangle, shoulders extended. Then tighten your armpits, like you're shortening your arms. Don't pull your body up, just kind of pull your shoulders back into the sockets. Then, keeping your legs straight, raise them up  towards the pull up bar. If you are extremely flexible, you should raise your straight legs all the way up and touch your ankles to the bar over your head. If you are not flexible you might have to bend your knees. This is the best way to work your abs. Your shoulders might feel sore. But it builds practical ab strength without getting on the erg.    Without a personal trainer, I don't have any other tips. The very best thing for you would be to train with kettlebells, but you would need a trainer.|`|bh57WSHfaa	go for practices...ask your skipper to join you..it'll be fun and motivating

CUdMsVSzaa	depending on like how big your school is and how into cheer leading it is, one requirement might be is that you need to do a back handspring...i cannot do that, but i can do a front one so its all good, lol  you will have to be flexible so you can do jumps and such, also a good memory for dances.   what i find is helpful is that you are either strong[[so you can base]] or have lots of spring[[so you can fly]] for stunts  and if you end up being a front or back for anything ALWAYS be there!!! we all learned that today..uugghh..    but here's a tip:: use mats when first stunting and tumbling!! and be farther back on the mats! because even though we were on mats,the girl still broke her wrist today..and i remember spraining my ankle first time i did a flip off of a prep with out a mat    so good luck! and hope you make it!!!|`|P02omlMlaa	like yell good

AA10297143	You really have to try out, or at least be seen in a few games by some scouts to answer this truthfully.  If you are what you say you are, then people should have already noticed you in some respects, maybe they have.  Straight out of high school though, don't expect a lot.  Getting a scholarship to play hockey at a good school is a better bet, but not sure how that would work with you being Canadian and all.|`|F934e4HQaa	yes, just practice and train hard.    PS:good luck|`|axxQzOCHaa	Only you, scouts, possible coaches can determine that.   Isn't part of the appeal of youtube the ability to showcase skills at something meaningful to you?   Otherwise do you play in tournaments where people from outside of your area could see  and further evaluate your talent?    ps. Did you mean to say FUTURE or FURTHER ?|`|iw3v5bgIaa	Exposure is impotant if you want a career in hockey, which will be very very hard.    Maybe you can get on a travel team and have others see your talent (and you can see the talent of others), then go to college, get an education and another career you're interesting in to fall back on while playing hockey (maybe on a scholarship!)    At your size make sure that you have good conditioning (running/jogging, weight lifting with less weight and more reps = endurance, and maybe a speed bag in the event you need to sock someone once in a while).     Get as much ice time as you can, but don't burn yourself out.     Insofar as your inconsistancy, keep focused on what you are doing, be the best you can be at whatever you do.    Good luck!!!    http://www.squidoo.com/sports-hockey-equ...
4owr19vCaa	could be it needs a motor adjustment:    -----    Motor height adjustment:           * A key component of proper gun functioning is the motor height set screw. This small hex screw (typically 1.5mm in width) is located at the end of motor housing, typically located in the grip of the gun. This screw ensures that the motor is set the proper distance from the gears in the gearbox. If the motor is too close or too far from the .bevel. gear of the gearbox, you will hear a soft or loud whine from the gun. In extreme cases, an improperly set screw will cause the gun to jam, break the gear, or strip the pinion gear on the head of the motor.        * Your motor height is set in place by the factory. After heavy use, the spinning of the motor may cause the set screw may tighten or loosen from its original position. You may notice unusual noises coming from your gearbox. You will need to adjust the screw into its proper position.         * A high pitch whining sound indicates your motor height may be too low. To correct this, you must turn the set screw clockwise to raise the motor up. Do this slowly while firing the gun in semiautomatic. Listen for a flat, consistent sound; the same that you heard when you fired the airsoft gun for the first time. Once you.ve achieved this, leave the screw in place.         * A high pitch, grinding sound indicates your motor is too high, or you have adjusted too far. Turn the screw counterclockwise to lower the motor while firing in semiautomatic. Again, listen for flat, consistent sound coming from your motor and gears.         * The key to adjusting the motor height is to minimize any sounds coming from your motor and gearbox.    -----    cheers|`|xMSESsGQaa	Sounds like bad wiring.|`|6f36240af8847ca83ec28b5f2b425b32aa	Can you describe the Choking sound better, and give us a brand name of the gun.

eDCyle05aa	He should definitely be in the hall of fame, he was one of the best to ever play at the tight end position. He had 815 rec. for over 10,000 yards, thats better than 99% of WRs that has ever played in the NFL.|`|yg3Pveakaa	I have to agree he was one of the players that led me to American Football..Along with Elway and TD they had a great Bronco team.|`|30LMCJrAaa	You ever hear him on Sirius Satellite radio? Listen to him for a couple of hours( if you can stomach it that long ), and you will learn what an annoying pain in the azz he is!

He will make it in soon, don't worry.|`|ABoo1doVaa	There is a long list of players that should be in the Hall of Fame. Jack Tatum was the starting safety on the all century team, Randy Gradishar was a Defensive player of the year and 7 time pro bowler, and Cris Carter was the second leading receiver when he retired.     Yes, I think Shannon should be in the PFHOF, but he isn't the most deserving that isn't in.|`|PaKCWpGSaa	one of the best tight ends ever a freak athletic should be in|`|uEIOgxWlaa	He will be one day.|`|wUooHVU3aa	So long as he declines to give a speech, I'd consider him a definite HOF candidate. No interest in hearing him garble marbles on the podium, but he was a solid player for a decade and led the Ravens to their only S.B. win to date.|`|a6EndAPiaa	He will get in.  I for one believe he was not elected on his first ballot because he an arrogant blow hard -- for example he claims that *he* reinvented the TE position (not Mike Ditka, or Kellen Winslow Sr).  I know if *I* had a vote I would not have voted for him.  I would vote for him next year though.|`|UWJinEbIaa	Sharp is one of the best receiving TE's in the NFL!  I would say that he is better than Antonio Gates, Tony Gonzalez, and maybe better than Mark Bravo or Keith Jackson.  Come on the media loved John Elway more than the Madden's man-crush on Bret Favre!  The Broncos did make it to the Super Bowl 5 times winning 2.....once they finally found the perfect RB in Terrell Davis.|`|gfB5VNXTaa	I do.  Until this season, he held the tight end record in almost every recieving category and won 3 Super Bowls.  For some reason, the media has always looked down upon the Broncos and that's why Elway's the only Bronco in the Hall when there should be at least 5 more.
XBDJHnpqaa	In the past olympics, there was an older person that called a coach one day and said that she wanted to do gymnastics. She won second place at vault at the age of like mid to higher 30's. Darling, anything is possible, put you heart into it and work at it. Not just work at it but really, really work at it! Also, there was annother lady that was in swimming, she won a medal at the the usally way past retirement age for the olympics of 40 years old. Back in the Athens olympics, there was a 23 year old in pole vault, that didn't start pole vaulting until she was 21 so its never to late to try to win the gold until the day that you tell yourself that it is too late and you shouldn't bother to try. That day that you give up is the day that you truely lose. Go for it, get a good coach, a year round coach at a place the specialises in gymnastics. If this is truely what you want, you need to see gymnastics not as a sport, but a part of who you are and a lifestyle. I wish you the greatest luck and try with all your heart, good things will come.....|`|ZpH2PFF9aa	i can tell you are a little kid|`|1nmCpqsWaa	Maybe not the olympics, alot of olympians started at a young age but, actually i think Alicia Sacramone started at 8 years old. the olympics is in 4 years, so if your ten you might not even be old enough.  Never give up your dream, and good luck :)!|`|8HmULotpaa	In the past yes, but in this day and age its very unlikely.  Olympic Gymnastics is getting harder and harder, so kids are having to start younger and younger and train more and more hours in order to be ready for olympic competition.    Where I like those who want to go to the olympics generally start training at 3-4 years of age.  By 4-5 years of age they are identified and put into special training classes that prepare them, because if things are taught incorrectly at this young age it can ruin their chances completly.    By 6-7 years of age they are competing at a similar level to most gymnasts twice their age and training around 10-15 hours a week.    By 9-10 years of age they are training 30 hours a week.    By 13 they are training twice a day 6 days a week for 5-7 hours a day.|`|RsTuacLtaa	it will be very good and by then if you want even a chance you should be spending like 3-5 hours at lest every other day. i am 13 and i started when i was like 4 and i am in the gym every day for like 3-5 hours it depends on the day. it will be hard for me to make it and i do not think that i will make it
1jmXT4Vvaa	Speedy nailed it.  Just to add that there are many differences in the way that they are designed.  For example most full autos fire from a open bolt.  Most semi autos fire from a closed bolt.  That makes them nearly impossible to convert to full auto.  In order for a private citizen to own a fully auto weapon, he/she must have a class III firearms stamp.  The weapon must also have been made prior to 1986.  And there are state and local laws that simply do not allow private citizens to own them.  Probably more info than you wanted, but you got it anyways.|`|Qh8L74W1aa	s semi auto matic gun is when u have to pull the trigger for everyshot a full auto you can hold the trigger and it will keep shooting

TnU3wk41aa	Your best bet is going to a physical snow shop and checking out their selection of goggles.  It's true that the kind of lenses you are looking for come in many different names depending on the brand you are looking at.  They are generally called "Reflective" or "Mirror" lenses.  They work very similarly to one way mirrors in that they only work when light is reflecting off the outside surface of the lens.  My personal preference is Electric goggles.  They call them Chrome lenses, but they are in the price range that you are looking for.  Hope this helps :)|`|3O0F5s6baa	I think painted lenses. But go to a store and try them on

O22gnXtWaa	If your practicing for your exam, don't use Red Cross one (its kinda easy compared to the Canadian Life Saving one)  General ideas for practice:  *Wear t-shirt if you can, wear beach pants  *Head up front crawl for long distance  *If its normal frontcrawl use 1 breath every 4-8 arms circle (My stanard is 5 or 6)  *Keep your feet in the water if possible, (Im not joking alot of people kick with bended knees)|`|Cj4i2pbTaa	The more strokes you can go without breathing, the better.  Keep your stroke clean, not sloppy.  Don't slap at the water or let your body sink.|`|36SJ9nGAaa	i have been swimming since i was like 5.  i would say...start trying to increase the time  that you can hold your breath.  and just practice your swimming.|`|AGXysOpzaa	Make sure your head is in the right position. I've been competitive swimming for years and what always got me as a kid was that my head was too high. Make sure it's not too low, either. And for god's sake, keep it pointing straight. Don't be giving yourself whiplash.|`|XBDJHnpqaa	Ok, there are a lot of factors that will determine how fast you are...  1) The shape you are in  2) What you wear  3) How you swim also known as your form.    To start off with what you asked first. Wear a speedo or annother skin tight suit. You are better off breathing on an odd stroke such as three because when you bring your head up to breathe, you create more drag and therefore requires more effort to maintain your speed. And if you breathe on an even stroke such as two, the same side has to take that resistance and that side will wear out faster. In swimming you want symetry! About twirling your hips. I'm not sure what your inmaging when you say twirl your hips but when you are taking strokes, you want to rotate your whole body (arms, torso, hips, and legs) so that you are on your side. The body has less friction on its side in the water than when your chest is flat to the bottom of the pool. Also, when you swim DO NOT look directly down, you want to look ahead so that the surface of the water is at the to of your googles. When you kick, the easiest way that I learned how to get a powerful kick is to inmagine that i have gum on the tips of my feet and I am trying to flick it off. Do you know what streamline is? Stream line is when you keep your body in a strait line, so that you are aquadynamic. Such as when you push off walls, put your hands out in front of you one hand over the other. Look strait down at the bottom of the pull, and put your arms so that the are on the back of your head. You don't  want you head inbetween your arms. Also, kick like hell! The further that you can go off a wall without surfacing the better. Also, when your surface, that is when you look ahead instead of down. only look down when pushing off a wall. That means that you will take less strokes. Also, when you are swimming, kicking hard is very important. When you have a weak kick, your hips sick in the water and create more drag which slows you down and wears you out faster. BTW, kicking does not come from the knees, it comes from the upper leg and hips. Your knees should hardly bend at all. For strokes, keep in mind that just because you are stroking faster or taking more stroke doesn't mean that you are going to go faster. Its all about how together your form is, how good you are about stroking your hand through the water, and how well your kicking. Look at the olympic videos, the champions take the fewest strokes most of the time and look like they are standing still. If you are going to be swimming a long distance, be sure that you glide through the water for a little while before taking annother stroke. I'd say that a great way to learn in to go on youtube and watch the olympic videos, I've learned a lot from them over the years.    I can go on and on but if you want more tips email me with Swimming tTips as the topic of the message. My e-mail is  beme1248@yahoo.com
LGVrhTFTaa	That would be to tempting for me to turn down..  A.Rod had an off year last year,but could rebound with a vengence this year.Also; with Tex. now hitting behind him,it gives him legitimate protection.Plus if you look at the position talent scarcity factor,3rd base is ALOT shallower then 1st base+outfield.  Howards' batting average has consistently dropped the last 3 years,and if this alarming trend continues you could have another Adam Dunn on your hands.And Bruce could become a great outfielder,but there are alot of other ones you could plug in,and not have much,or any drop off in production.    ~g0()d LuCk!~|`|SEcM9EDZaa	If it's any sort of keeper league I'd have to go with Bruce and Howard. Howard strikes out too much but his power is undeniable. Bruce could become a superstar with his limitless potential.  A-Fraud is entering the downside of his career and while he's a future Hall of Famer player he's not worth 2 great, young players.    In fact, if I have Bruce and Howard, I'd try to grab Longoria...I'd be set at those 3 positions for a long time.    If it's a 1-year league, go with whatever you prefer.|`|sJHrquRKaa	I wouldn't do it, with howard you have power and Bruce is an average 300 hitter with a-rod you have a good player overall don't get me wrong. What ever you decide but howard is power and bruce will have a good OBP|`|e8fFZIWOaa	depends on the type of league. if its a keeper league, i want Howard and Bruce , not arod...if its a one year league i want arod.    what are the scoring categories? that always comes into play and what are the positions? , what would your team look like after and before the trade?    on the merits of the deal alone i would trade arod for those two but who will be your 3rd basemen? see what i mean? give us more detail and i can definitely give you an excellent answer|`|UoT86gbiaa	Howard is great but has his weaknesses (has everybody else forgotten his pre-break numbers last year?).  Bruce has amazing promise, but you're talking about getting the best fantasy player of the last 5 years, who's also eligible at a thin position.  Take the deal, and never doubt yourself.

DOVbF4Piaa	Road bike frames are measured in cm.  A mountain, hybrid, or a comfort bike in that size should be ok you.  It really depends on your inseam size.  A road bike should be around 50-52 cm.    http://www.coloradocyclist.com/bikefit|`|xxq5JAM6aa	I am 5'7" and have a 50 cm road bike that is a tad too big. 48 would probably fit me better.

1JglzZTjaa	i wish i knew when i find out ill tell ya ;)|`|gzRZlfpLaa	i not sure, but you throw a football with a spiral by using your hand and arm together    ....... |....  ........|..........2 points ..........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)|`|UtwJVPn5aa	look it up on internet. not that hard. but hard to describe on internet. believe its not even hard|`|bv7azlRdaa	hold the ball near the back with your little finger on the last 1 or 2 threads. Bring the ball up to your neck and throw it. When you release the ball try to spin it with your last two fingers.   Practice, you will get the feel of it before long.|`|QjO3m7QKaa	When I do it i put my middle 3 fingers on spread out on the laces, and I kind of "throw" my wrist along with the football. Kind of like snapping your wrist while throwing the ball.|`|VoKzvoxKaa	*  Just click you're wrist down when you throw it         * I have been playing QB for a while. If your hand is small put your ring on the first slot and your pinky on the third.If your hand is larger like mine put your ring on the second slot and your pinky on the fourth.Cuff the ball with your left hand and then with your throwing hand bring the ball up to and behind your ear. Then release the ball in a forward motion and follow through.Following through is very very important if you do not do this you will have no spiral. After following through your palm should face downwords on your opposite leg.         * Just line your fingers on the laces and flick your wrist when throwing.         * I usually throw a football with fingers on 2 and 5, but after watching mike vick he uses 1 and 4. I'm 15 and got 9 and half inch hands so its easy to get the football flung off, but the hard part i find is throwing a perfect spiral at 45 degrees to get more length. Fling your wrist in coordination with your elbow fling.         * I manage to make the ball spiral and I put my middle finger on the first lace my ring on the 3 and my pinky just of the 5th.|`|b0Fdhac3aa	It depends on the size and how much of a hurry you're in.|`|SXWbG2Eqaa	have your dad or someone who's good at football teach you, and practice practice practice.|`|OKpoqhUMaa	point your toe to where you want to throw grip the laces(2 fingers on laces pinky and ring) and follow through Straight with your arm|`|3PMr8V96aa	Practice makes Perfect.

This might be easier if you practice rolling it off your fingers, then add in the throw when that is perfected.

AA11573840	No fixing a warped board, but I would definitely fix the dings on the bottom and try and make it as smooth as possible. To tell if it is in fact warped. you can get straight stick lay it across and look for weird gaps. or look at the board at eye level down the center and look for any twist, it actually should be pretty easy to look for warp, but the dings will slow you down more than the warp.
CBVlu3Gvaa	While other extracuricular activities will be looked at...the primary things they look at are grades and competitions.  Enter and compete in as many State and local Junior golf activities and tournaments as you can.  Work hard on your game......|`|iPWKzzQtaa	No.It's not related. The only way it helps if you are all state and get a scholarship...then you play golf as a walk on.    I believe, as wbaker said, they look at grades and character. I didn't say don't play ball...it's good, but not in terms of the scholarship.    Also, at the level of Div 1...I would look for a kid who is 100% committed to the game. That and the good citizenship angle would be the most important factors.|`|sBrummATaa	uh it will help you get into the college but i dont think it will help you for golf|`|Gigk11gUaa	It won't help your chance of getting a golf scholarship because coaches normally look at golf scores and grades but it might help your game. If you've notice all the new guys coming up on the tour have amazing stamina and fitness because nowadays with the length of the courses it is needed. From a golf perspectice basketball won't help you get a scholarship but it will help the fitness aspect of your golf game.|`|rjEnFSAIaa	I disagree with most of the other answers. While grades and golf scores are obviously going to be most important, I think adding another sport will help your chances.    Look at it this way: if there are two identical candidates (same GPA, same golf ability) and the only difference is one also played basketball and the other only played golf, which is the coach going to choose?     By having another extracurricular on your resume, you'll display better time-management skills and can make a case for being in better shape. Your basketball coach would also be able to provide an excellent recommendation regarding your physical ability, dedication, mental toughness, and other "intangibles" that often combine to make good athletes great.    Other activities that may help you would be getting a part-time job (time management, resourcefulness, another source for a recommendation) - especially if you can get one in the golf industry. Caddying or even being a cart kid at a local course will get you some cash, show you can set and follow a schedule, manage your time, and probably get you some free golf.    Community service or other volunteering efforts look great on a resume or application.    ** Just make sure the added commitment(s) doesn't get in the way of your golf or cause you to earn lower grades. **    Best of luck!|`|dHc2lN39aa	If anything it helps your chances. They will mostly look at grades and your golfing ability but if they see that your well rounded and athletic it will help. Also golf is a summer sport, basketball is a winter sport so you can practice both
Y4mz8BShaa	Almost everything on ASGI is good quality. Stay away from the TM and WA pistols (overpriced, underpowered plastic) and you'll be fine.

Y4mz8BShaa	DE generally has low quality airsoft guns I wouldn't recommend even going near. Their shotguns and L96 are great budget airsoft guns though. Their UMP is nice, for the price, but I wouldn't recommend it. It's a good MPEG, but doesn't quite make my under $100 list. Only one I would consider adding onto it. The Galaxy MP5K's are better quality, the same price, and get the job done just as well. You might have to make a few adjustments to the UMP, but it's a decent AEG overall.    For other suggestions:  http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.ph...  You can remove the stock.    Nothing wrong with a pistol. Smaller, light, better quality, and gets the job done just as well, if not better.  http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.ph...  http://www.airsoftgi.com/product_info.ph...|`|xMSESsGQaa	Ya they are a mid-quality company.

xOReEw6Waa	Before you reblue a gun always make sure it doesn't have collector value. If you reblue something valuable it cuts the value in half. The cold bluing works with good preparation and the kits come with instructions. Because no one on here knows your gun, ask a local gun shop which system would work best. This is just one link I picked up.  http://browningmgs.com/Colt1928/Bluing.h...    Sometimes it is better to let the gunsmith do it. My dad had his reblued  professionally and it looked great.

Let's see:  1) KG well-rested, didn't play in the last two games.  2) Bynum out, Lakers needed him and if he was there it would have been a blowout.  3) Lakers playing the second-night of a back-to-back, actually 3 games in 4 days in 4 different cities. So, the freshest legs would have been of Boston's players.  4) Lakers missed free throws, they don't normally miss free throws, and they went a la Shaq tonight.      That's for reasons why Boston will never win unless they take advantage of it.|`|xhHfXuKFaa	good game. and yes if they meet in the finals we are going to see two teams that really want to win.|`|uxregJ0faa	What real? You bashed their win. But I guess you redeemed yourself. It was really was a great game.|`|3teWTOPqaa	It was a great game and we did get the best of your guys on this night. So let's see what happens in the playoff.    Fake Lakers fans? Dude coming from a Boston fan that doesn't say much.|`|YQLNqgnWaa	great game, pierce shoulda however sealed the game with the two freethrow, but great game and if we lost if you guys didnt brag it would be no hard fealings; also i wont brag but good game|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Agreed, if they meet  it will be a fantastic finals this year. The Lakers missed 12 from the stripe so they were lucky to win, but there defense was good when it needed to be. This game felt a bit orhcestrated to me.|`|IZ3tNmpyaa	Yes I cant wait for the finals.. I have a feeling that it will be Kobe vs Lebron in the finals.. ( nothing against boston, its just that it makes more financial sense for the NBA to have that) But deep down in my heart I am hoping for another Classic finals series against you guys.. That will be awesome.. You guys take care of Cleveland out there in the east and will take care of Business here in the west.. **** stern and see you guys in the Finals.. May the best team win..|`|fuYYRJXtaa	Lol... Good one MC..|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	I see a white flag laker fans. Time for a truce?|`|tBuzrlSdaa	Personally I am on here usally at night when Im not at gym or doing homework or all that stuff. Im here at like this time always if you havent noticed. Good game..|`|Vp3RrTpeaa	Thanks but this is my 1st time seeing you and people are gonna believe me because of the badge. Anyways great game and hopefully we meet again this season.|`|n6514FLVaa	yeah i can agree to that lakers and celtics were playing good tonight and it would be a hell of a finals! but if beat the celtics now image when we get bynum back!|`|aGNjZmyJaa	Yes, it would be a good game.|`|TLZ3GEEXaa	Yeah... this had to had been the number one game in the season, no blowouts, and both teams went to overtime, with a Laker win by only one... Yeah...    It would be a good NBA Finals this year (but to tell the truth, I still want the Lakers to face the Cavs in the Finals) and if the Lakers were to face the Celtics, it would probably be one of the best.|`|L0ft1eo7aa	top 5 game this season   good game cant wait for the playoffs to start i love the energy in the playoffs|`|D61u7t1zaa	Shut up. I'm surprised Paul pierce didnt need a wheelchair. Celtics =  1 in technical fouls. You guys are pathetic. We'll own you once Bynum gets back. Just watch.|`|TNN6U75Maa	That was very nice of you say something like that. Although your not like most Celtic fans. But sorry for burst your bubble but the Cavaliers will beat the Celtics in the Eastern Conference Finals.|`|fKlZdoPHaa	Finally you decided to show some class.     Yes, it was a great game. It wasn't the best performance by the Lakers, but they hung in there, and pulled it off.     I just wish that KG stayed in the game. It would have been more competitive.|`|P0NZpW3maa	Been a LALA fan since Eddie Jones. Since Kobe came off the bench!|`|WYMsOPOhaa	Im an honest Laker fan, no bs.     and the finals will be great no doubt about it.     iv known kobe was a hell of a player, but didnt like him throwin up to many shots in OT    Lakers were awful on the line|`|FKy5oTjHaa	great game, i could not relax a minute from the 4th quarter on when they kept trading blows. i was especially impressed by their effort on the latter part of a back-to-back|`|ovBNkYtpaa	where was the lakers D ? i think they are getting softer by the game. i remember their squad in the 90s, kobe,fish,horry,shaq,george... man, they were solid and not finesse at all. not an overload of foreigners either.    after that game- its clearly between LA and BOSTON. 7 game series, C's without posey, lakers (hopefully) with bynum- i say LA has the edge.    -pierce choked, what else is new. i guess he just broke down when the MVP chant started- tooo much pressure to be great.|`|CLXTxsoqaa	Just because we don't hang out in the basketball section on yahoo answers 24/7 like you nerds doesn't mean we're not real lakers fans. Some of us have lives.|`|aVmXxQNtaa	As far as I know, all Laker fans are true, unlike Celtics bandwagons. N Yess, i agree it was a good game. N if you dont believe me im a laker fan, check all my answers, there all about lakers.|`|1dbbebe6a86ba941271bf6cf792ed18aaa	It was one hell of a game!   And i give props to the Celts, for the integrity and toughness they put in.|`|0pbQg0Ohaa	1 to nothin Boston Sports Fan|`|clgc86Voaa	Big game. What a classic. Both teams played hard and we finally see some of that hate come out on both sides. Love it. The only thing i didnt like in the game is the referees calling ticky tack fouls on both sides. Let the players play and be more physical. And Ray Allen didnt get fouled on that last shot. Gasol didnt even touch him on the way down. Both teams are the best in the Association. It be great for these two teams to get to the Finals. And get well Bynum.|`|b492423af2d29fe3c720b5001a69bd89aa	It was a good gm between two great teams and this time the lakers won but like I keep telling people the celtics are still the champs until someone can beat them in the post season...........so props to both teams and your right free throws won and lost this gm.|`|05xB3cPkaa	Nice win, glad Lakers stood up for themselves. Still they need another big to bang bodies underneath. I'm hoping for a minor trade at the deadline.|`|wXxJUnLJaa	Yeah it was a good game.|`|UY7vVEjOaa	whats the question
n6514FLVaa	how is west close to bynum!!! dude ur on crack! lakers are underman with bynum west shouldnt even be in the same sentence!|`|0tTHoyktaa	The cavs. they r the only undefeate dteam at home and if the lakers could win, then we would prove we are the best team in the lueage|`|xhHfXuKFaa	the cavs streak will be more important if we break it.|`|uxregJ0faa	Both would be. When is a win not important. We need to send a statement that L.A can win on the road anywhere|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	The Cavaliers. The Cavs are without a good shooter in Delonte West and the Lakers are without Bynum. should be fair and should be a good game.|`|l0iCqzlQaa	good win, but i think it  would be big for the Lakers to end the cavs streak.|`|s1IkFOJVaa	the lakers are not going to win on sunday|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	It's close but I go with the Celtics because of the rivalry and what happened in the finals last year.|`|tBuzrlSdaa	Would be bigger for Lakers to beat Cavs at home to end their undefeated home streak|`|fKlZdoPHaa	Every game is valuable. Each win is valuable.     One game can make a difference to the very end of the season. Think playoff seeding and home court advantage.|`|sCHUFUXsaa	For me, the Celtics..    Finally got our revenge!|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	Either win doesn't matter it's all about the Playoffs.

2b8238fefe9db0533aa44f0a2b1bc504aa	Really, it depends on how much experience you have, how much you get to practice per week, and how hard you work at it. I know that's really cliched, but we have a soph girl who clears 6 feet, and i know of a few that can clear 8! I vault too (sophomore), and my PR is 10', and I'm pretty happy with that, and I put in a lot of work too. So if you're happy with your best height, congrats, and that's really good for you. :) But it's also a "you get out of it what you put into it," type of thing. So my advice is to work hard, and get plenty of weight training, sprints, and pole vault reps in. And you'll do well. :)|`|shVgCizBaa	In very general terms, most high school girls who pole vault weigh between 110 and 140 lbs. - and boys between 125 and 165 lbs. Poles from 10'8" up to 15' are typically the lengths used in High School and the test weight of these go from 90 lbs. up to 190 lbs. There is no "specific weight" you have to be in order to pole vault. However one very important rule is that the vaulter NEVER vault on a pole rated below their weight. Tell you High School coach about your interest in pole vaulting. They will determine the best introductory activities and whether they think you would have fun and progress as a vaulter.http://www.polevaulteducation.org/Email....|`|veT5XWVNaa	Well my sister is a sophmore and her Personal record is 8'6 and her friend is 9' so Would say between 8 feet to 9'6 :D|`|BEaRYcKzaa	You can never really tell an average height that you should be vaulting.  There is always room to improve, and you have to have a good coach to help you improve.  I know of a girl at my school who is only jumping 6' as a sophomore, but I was jumping almost 8' when I was a sophomore.  I used to vault with another girl who was jumping 9' when she was a sophomore.  It really just depends on how well you are being coached, and how much effort you are willing to put towards your vaulting experience.  In my state there are different athletic conference, and the bigger conferences are jumping about a half foot to a foot higher than what most girls in my conference are jumping.  If your worried that your not good enough try going to a camp or find previous vaulters that can help you.  My brother went to state for vaulting, and he gives me tips to get better.  Our high school boy's coach is also well trained for coaching vault, and he takes extra time to help me out.  In the end I would say that a satisying height for a high school girl is 8'.
fHxpycJSaa	It just keeps on getting better. How about Dick LeBeau? If he doesn't call a zone blitz on the goal line, Harrison probably doesn't intercept the pass and the Cardinals go into halftime with a 14-10 lead. It's not Warners' fault for throwing an interception, it's LeBeaus' fault for calling a zone blitz. It's not fair. Teams shouldn't be allowed to zone blitz when playing the Cardinals in the Super Bowl.|`|m4yyCDNCaa	Yes..yes they should.|`|LydL7EN6aa	no they cant blame one person for sucking so horribly!|`|a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	Somehow this is gonna come around to Brett Favre, isn't it?    Or the Yankees?    Or Canada?    Let's just blame the French and be done with it.|`|aaKYVMk2aa	Lmao.|`|UxooffHZaa	Huh? There's a lot of Drama. Could the Cardinals have beat the Ravens?|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	Everyone should be mad at Michael Vick, and he should still be rotting in jail, or being tortured, he's the scum of the Earth.|`|mTSOJKlyaa	that love person has got some anger issues    on the other hand, lets blame everyone    as long as you all know harrison is a thug and should have been ejected|`|d065d40a6781127c80dc5959554a2d4faa	Should we blame the poor recession for the Cardinals loss in the Super Bowl? If the economy was not so bad they would have been able to have more fans there and it wouldn't have been like a homegame.|`|8fe3c5c628ca1e4652c6de261ec861bfaa	Somebody else would have picked Ryan before the Ravens.

zb40cLwOaa	I think the Raw chamber would be able to work together better as Triple H, Big Show, Undertaker, Edge, and especially Jeff and Matt would not be able to work together. They all hate each other. Raw would end up winning from that advantage.|`|vyHwhACjaa	Usually I'm a firm defender of Raw but on this occasion the answer has to be Smackdown. The Raw chamber is shaping up to be quite the disappointment. Kofi Kingston and Rey Mysterio have NO place in an elimination chamber and quite frankly cheapen the match. Not only that, but no-one has a chance of winning except John Cena, as we all know they want Cena to defend the title at Mania. Having said that, I really hope Jericho wins. Anyway, I digress, but Smackdown would win, no doubt.|`|YSBTwFpqaa	lol pretend|`|jMO9kDfWaa	The last two entrants ar Kozlov and Jeff Hardy. They had a smackdown double taping they did this fridays smackdown 2 weeks ago.     Hopefully Jeff Hardy gets his title back cuz he's my fav! but i would have HHH win though and have Orton face HHH for the WWE title.|`|sMTNLNF6aa	gee let me think um smackdown chamber|`|bSsBGrZVaa	SMACKDOWN CHAMBER|`|dGYR81enaa	Smackdown chamber bigger names and there's more controversy on who will take the last two spots|`|lr68XuMFaa	The Smackdown chamber for sure|`|SBzfbIU3aa	Smackdown chamber, hands down!|`|MTQ2dmWJaa	of course smack down chamber will win.  smack down rocks.....|`|3u1FaRe0aa	raw
jLRpCt03aa	I googled him he's yummy..i mean good lol :p|`|sCHUFUXsaa	i saw him there..  he's okay|`|TNN6U75Maa	Hes an awesome point guard. He will go Top 3 in this years NBA draft. But doesn't he have one more year on his contract overseas?|`|DQp1c4aZaa	Yes, he will probably be qualified to be drafted next year...I like his flashy passes but he does need to improve his defense more.|`|TIwQCBGiaa	Nice young player...He will not have a impact in the league in my opinion. He'll get drafted high and end back over in europe..He may be quick  but he doesn't set guys up..Has no change of pace in his game..Not a believer yet|`|Kwywmcs8aa	He wasn't as great as everyone hyped him up to be.|`|YQLNqgnWaa	yah, top 5 draft pick, great young pg|`|vzYJJCdqaa	HE NEEDS TO COME TO SACTOWN!!  WELL,, WAIT ..were gonna get blake griffin...      umm..yah ..hes really good|`|eVqeIqtCaa	yeah. he plays like nash or cp3    -edit-  yeah.. u should stop watching raul gonzalez.. haha|`|fuYYRJXtaa	Yeah we know him... He's pretty good for his age.  He was doing Deron Williams & Kobe pretty good in the Olympics... But I personally don't think he's ready for NBA Basketball.
YpXENeF2aa	Howard is offensive,  Marion is defensive AND offensive.  Marion > Howard.(When healthy)    Okafor plays out of position in Charlotte, he's really a PF, but they have no one else. At PF, he's better than Kaman at C.|`|DQp1c4aZaa	Shawn Marion is more effective on both ends of the floor, J-Howard to me is not as versatile although I like his early 1st quarter push..    I don't like Chris Kaman but he is definitely the better player at full potential, and Nene is very underrated, he picks better shot selection(leading the league in FG%) and is more consistent in offense(right now).|`|jHJ0W9QNaa	Josh Howard  Nene Hilario  Emeka Okafor    good game Lakers. as a Celtics fan, you earned my respect. i won't be a sore loser and i'll give Kobe Bryant the credit he deserves.|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	Shawn MArion  Nene  Emeka Okafor|`|sCHUFUXsaa	Marion used to be good.  now i dont know what happened..  he's an allstar before..    I'll go with Okafor on the 2nd matchup
0Dm3WEMcaa	It will be a surprise if it happens because Kane isn't on the best of runs is he? Wins tag team matches but not a lot else! He deserves the title. However i would Keep Orton in the picture and bring up the Kelly Kelly thing again to add a multi layer story to the main event. Cena wants his title back, Orton wants the title and Kane wants to get revenge for Kelly Kelly. Cena, Orton and Kane all work well together and it would make for a very interesting Triple Threat. One of the title matches needs to be one on one and i'd prefer that to be Edge vs. Triple H. then we get HBK and Taker, We all end up very happen with WM25|`|Z0IKiIJ4aa	I honestly didnt think of this scenario, but it is interesting and would be really good if it happens.|`|dGYR81enaa	HELL YEAH! Kane hasn't been world champ since 1998, and HBK vs Undertaker would be awesome, but i reckon that orton should stay on raw!|`|6LQNK51uaa	Surprise but I ll love to see it...as u may know that Kane is near his retirement,so it will be good to see him as the real champ(not as the glorified one night champion)    EDIT_->Sorry Prince ..cleaned my fan list b/c of Trolls|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	Kane becoming World Heavyweight Champion would certainly surprise me, but it would be the best surprise WWE has given me in at least several months.    As for Orton, I think he'll stay on RAW, and if anybody besides Cena wins the RAW Elimination Chamber, I can see that becoming a Triple Threat because of Cena using his rematch clause.  If these events were to take place, SmackDown's WrestleMania main event could very well be Edge vs. Triple H.    Finally, it's no secret that Undertaker is my favorite WWE superstar and HBK is near the bottom of my list, so if that match were to be a part of WrestleMania 25, I'd be too nervous about the outcome of the match to order it live.  Should Undertaker's streak remain intact afterward, I'd get a replay as a late birthday present or wait for the DVD as a potential Christmas present.  Even though I have a strong dislike for HBK, I have to respect what he can do in the ring, so regardless of the outcome, it would certainly be an amazing match.|`|NLJ33Nkeaa	I Doubt it....the wwe hasnt been using kane well since his debut...kane deserves to be the world title holder like 10 times by now...if they only would give kane some big Face turn or something like that then u could see kane wining the championship....i dont think it would be REMATCH or something like that....maybe kennedy might return or something but im pretty sure Kane wont win the EC....it would suprise if he does      EDIT-.- .....What Happend To Live And Die?
NLJ33Nkeaa	Well Clown....Randy vs HHH is gonna happen.....i doubt if edge is gonna be in the picture because of the whole hardy christian thing....it might not rock the crowds because we,ve already seen these battle it out so many time not to menton last years wrestlemania...-.-    Shawn Michaels vs The Undertaker II....well this might happen because they gave out the rumors of whats gonna happen....i would say this WILL Rock the crowds out of their seats!....for some reason...i dont want this match to happen    Kane vs John Cena....well this is very unlikely because i doubt Kane Winning the Championship...i have a feeling its gonna be someone else and cena,s gonna keep the title till WM 25....i just want Kane to come back with his masked atttire...i donno if it would rock the crowds because they arent pushing kane much....well i hope this match happens      EDIT:-well im 13 years old but i ve watched alot of WWE...im REALLY scared that HBK might beat taker in this match and taker my lose his streak....and im also scared that this might be HBK and Takers Last Match...They Made the WWE i just dont wanna see this match or both of them leave.    EDIT:-...I Hope That Happens Man....Maybe They Might Retire from wrestling when steph get pregnant with a third baby and Taker and HBK might become GM of brands....but i dont see taker becoming a GM....lol...maybe he might get his ABA gimmick again....i liked it...then we could them as GM,s    Edit:-... i like his ABA gimmick but not more than the dead man gimmick ...i just think that if they make him the GM of smackdown then they might need his ABA gimmick cause nobody can imagine a Dead GM....HBK might become the GM Next Year and then turn heel and Screw People(my fantasy)...|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	I'm sticking to my theory!    WWE title: Edge (c) vs Triple H    World Title: Kane (c) vs Orton vs Cena (I don't see Kane winning but if he does this is the match i want)    HBK vs Undertaker... who doesn't want that match and can we please lynch them?    LOL at sleepybeach's matches... just because you can do that on your latest WWE video game, Available at all good retailers, doesn't mean the WWE is that stupid. =D|`|it2UVkF4aa	Yes.|`|XkBzfEBUaa	no....just because the story lines don't make a whole lot of sense at this time    I'd say    Main Event:  Kane & Taker vs  Orton, Cody Rhodes, and Ted DiBiase    John Cena vs. Jericho for the title  (ladder match)    Rey Mysterio and Kofi Kingston vs. Mike Knox and Santino Marella|`|8Im1iGFTaa	ya that would be great but i dont think they will happen

p96RB31Baa	357 mag|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	Everyone is right, but hasn't explained their answers properly.  The 357 has a higher velocity, as well as a smaller cross section (it's not as big around as the 45).  You put these together and you have a caliber that is going to penetrate deeper.  The 45 is not a good caliber for hunting deer.  I'm sure it has been used, but it's not recommended.  Most experts will recommend a 357 as a minimum caliber for hunting deer with a handgun.|`|S71MT9USaa	The .357 Magnum round had the best one shot stopping power of any round, including the .45 ACP, according to the Strasbourg Goat Tests.   Although there is some controversy over the parameters and results of those tests, having first hand knowledge of the .357 Magnum from an early age (11), I have to agree with them. I have several .40 S&W (2 Sigs and a Glock - one Sig I have fitted with a .357 Sig barrel), two .45s (a Para-Ordnance and an FIE/Browning), and several .357 mags (4" S&W, 6" Colt Python, and 4" Colt King Cobra). I have seen evidence that some .40 S&W rounds can achieve similar results and I'm not sure if a 10mm was used in those tests or not, but I would suspect it capable of also being at the top. The .40 S&W is a short version of the 10mm. The .357 Sig is a .40 cartridge with a .357 slug.    Edit: BTW the longer the barrel (up to a point) the higher the impact velocity and accuracy. This is the reason rifles have more stopping power (and accuracy) than handguns of the same caliber. There are longer barrels (generally) available in revolvers (rather than semi-automatics) making revolvers a better choice for hunting purposes.|`|dfBwVxXFaa	better check your laws, most places it is illegal to hunt with an auto loader. But as stated, the .357 is a much better round.  But I would suggest a .44 mag if you are gonna try to hunt deer with it.|`|HZvdr8VLaa	Say what you will, I have killed 2 deer with my .45 . It is plenty of gun!  I own both and don't disagree that the .357 is a good round, but for all who say the .45 'don't have what it takes' I call 'bull'.. I have done it.|`|80OPj9gGaa	Oh .357 mag hands down. You need that added muzzle velocity. .45 ACP is a great manstopper because of its sheer size, but it's slow; and it's a fairly short range round, anti-personnel round. The .357 gives you better trajectory and knockdown power at ranges.    Make sure your barrel's long though, get all the velocity you can.|`|a601b94b9c36ada94a2406cfc59f209caa	ether one but I prefer the 357 mag because of the barrel 6" or 8"|`|6ba3f5a12cec5d8398a9d42d17a5464aaa	The higher muzzle velocity, plus more energy would lean toward the .357, that is not to say a .45 won't kill a deer. It just doesn't have ideal ballistics for hunting. Also, you have to consider the barrel of the weapon. Some rifles shoot the .45 (the popular Snakecharmer shotgun is one..Marlin's Camp Carbine in .45. of the 1980's,  I think Marlin made a lever-action .357 carbine). In a PINCH I'd use the .45 but only the .357 gives enough penetration when hunting deer-sized game. The .45 is an excellent caliber for what it was designed for. Killing humans. No thought was ever given for it to do anything else until decades later.The .45 has become the designated caliber for many timed-accuracy and realistic-shootout competitions but when bringing home bacon, or venison, the .357 has an edge but a rifle caliber, say 30-30 or 30-06 etc.are common hunting loads and much more common hunting rounds. The typical deer rifle has all-weather scope, bolt action and synthetic or wooden stocks. A good hunting rifle can be found for $150.00 or cost $5000. Jed Clampett may have had the right idea-use a shotgun!  Texas Tea!!|`|zynzjJ65aa	A 357 magnum will do nicely, but a 45acp will also get the job done.|`|XXMv8CePaa	There is no easy way to kill a deer. Its either dead or not dead.|`|OAEuYZkZaa	The .357 Magnum.  More velocity, more energy than the .45 ACP.    Doc|`|QrjuueMCaa	I guess Rambo and I are the only ones in this boat. I have shot 5 whitetail deer with my .45 and they went no farther than when I shot them with the .357 even with basically the same shot placement. I would say the .357 would have more range than the .45, but they work swimmingly up to 50 yards from my personal experience. (Yes, the .45 has no problem 'passing-thru' and preformed wonderfully.)|`|M6fzLJtmaa	what they said, both will do it however 357 is a fast|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	The .357 magnum. A .40S&W can take a deer. It's been done.|`|6KaMW1Vzaa	Neither is a particularly good choice. Several have pointed out the better velocity/energy of the 357, but I'm not sure that's important. What does pose a problem is that 45 ACP comes in, obviously, autoloader platforms, and they require a more or less rounded meplat for good feeding, exactly what you don't want for a hunting bullet. You could probably work up a load in 45 ACP using a 45 Colt bullet like Lyman's cast  452664 for the purpose, to be put int the chamber while you have something else that shoots to the same point of aim in the chamber, that would work well enough, but it seems like it's making a point the hard way, and it would probably be almost as expensive as just buying a revolver in forty-something.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	The tried, true, tested, and proven no-nonsense 357 Magnum is the one.* Use the 6 inch barrel with 158 grain jacketed hollow point bullet for hunting ammo.*|`|PXimiZCdaa	357, no contest|`|QjUFTZVEaa	the 45 is a larger caliber, but much less power and powder behind it.    So thats definitely the .357

Have you ever seen those eyes?  AHHHH!  But honestly the only coach I wouldn't give a chance is Lovie Smith.  Lovie Smith is like a Lakers fan, he couldn't give a ****.  He has no emotion, and if someone was picking a fight with him, he would probably take a deep breath and find a score board to look at.  Then he would send in a shitty QB to fight for him *cough, orton, cough grossman*.    But the Samurai Mike Singletary would take all any day.|`|Nzk70xVwaa	Mike Tomlin probably.

I would pick him; he looks like a real scrapper.  I can picture him literally chewing Lovie Smith's face off, while simultaneously punching Sean Payton in the side of the head repeatedly.  While Wade Phillips watches in the corner, crying.    If Gruden doesn't qualify, then I'm taking Tom Cable, the Raiders coach.  He looks like one of those guys your friend bumps into at a bar, and you do everything you can to buy him a round before he gets mad and decides to start swinging.|`|xxtvhn5Naa	I'd put my money on Mike Tomlin.  Andy Reid would just sit on people, Norv Turner would sit in the corner, Tom Cable might do good, just because he's mad at himself for getting hired to the Raiders, Jeff Fisher would get on a building and star shooting people, Wade Philips would sit on the other end of people that Reid sits on.  Ken Whisenhunt would play rock-paper-scissors with Tony Sparano.  Mike Shanahan would twiddle his thumbs to confuse Mike McCarthy.  John Harbaugh would send Ray Lewis after Jim Zorn.  Bill Belichick would cheat and and throw bean-bags at everyone instead.  Mike Holmgren would bring out is kung-fu moves and kick Jon Gruden is the face.
2VGbJtnCaa	If I am the cards GM, and Warner comes back. I try to trade Leinhart for a 2nd round or high 3rd round pick. But he is more than likely a bust.

Great Question|`|Bgpk4npBaa	Matt Leinhart will be traded if warner signs anymore then a 2 year deal He will not sit the bench for a old man hes got the talent to be a starter he should demand to be traded to someone like the jets if Farve doesnt come back|`|1Byis7Flaa	Leinhart I hope leaves the Cards.

We already have Tavaris Jackson, who has more upside then any of these.    Just because Minnesota has a QB issue, does not mean they are going to pay 1st and 2nd round picks for other team's trash.|`|fHxpycJSaa	He won't start as long as Warner is there. No way he plays ahead of Warner, no matter how old he is. Warner is a Hall of Famer, Leinhart is a soft, whiny, spoiled momma's boy.|`|616b18f35255971ece90dca0da3b2da8aa	Leinhert is under contract for next year. Warner has never stayed totally healthy for 2 full seasons consecutively. Most people still feel Leinhert is a potential starter in the league. I'd keep things as they are for next season and see how things develop. A smooth transition from Warner to Leinhert may give the Cards some sustained competitiveness that they haven't had much of in the past.|`|qfVE2KFtaa	Leinart is probably not the answer the Cardinals need,so probably he'll ride the bench or be traded.|`|sPiwb8Hraa	He will eventually start.|`|UxooffHZaa	I don't think Leinert will ever be a serious NFL QB. I think if he had the ability, it would have been apparent by now.

But Mizzou is a one man show and once they lose Chase Daniel that will have an effect by not like USC losing their entire linebacking core which is going to hurt really really bad. Don't forget that USC also lost half of their coaching staff so I think that USC is going to take 3rd in the PAC-10 with no chance of winning it this year.|`|VTN4Qun9aa	Georgia will hurt the most, closely followed by Missou.

No, Lebron is averaging 2 more a game.  Assists?  Nope, again, Lebron averaging 2 more a game.  Career stats?  Lebron leads Kobe.  So what is Kobe better at?  Yeah, he won 3 titles with Shaq and hasn't done a thing since.  He's a ballhog who doesn't involve his teammates and its all about Kobe.  I'd take Lebron over Kobe anyday.    I'm in no way saying that Kobe sucks, he's a great player and a great shooter, but he isn't a team player.  He doesn't do the extra things like involve his team or help out on the boards, he just shoots and shoots and shoots more.      You saying that Lebron James sucks, the Celtics, Cavs, and Spurs all suck, just shows how ignorant you are.

NNn84vTCaa	Unless WWE can bring back people from the dead, get them out of retirement, heal their previously broken necks - they cant.    And besides, even if it did come back, everyone would be on here b*tching that it isn't as good as the original.    Edit; If people want the Attitude era back so much, then invest in a freaking time machine.|`|bTXDb5YIaa	i don't know if it will come back id on't think they will have another person be crusicfied on a cross again or some girl on live tv showin her **** or the way the divas dressed back then|`|WAGAcLPMaa	Everyone remember how they attempted to bring back DX and that was terrible for the most part? Or how they attempted to bring back nWo and how downright awful that was? WWE doesn't have a good track record of bringing things back and I wouldn't expect them to. You can't just redo something and think that all the magic will come right back.    If the WWE attempted to bring back the Attitude Era, it would be a failure of epic proportions.|`|KH9bbeCNaa	its never gonna come back coz its over and done, it was the best at its prime and lets leave it at that|`|JcGi56qkaa	They arent.

WWE is not looking to be nostalgic and bring back every retired superstar from the past, but are building their empire for the future. But it is possible that WWE will become that interesting again if they hire the right people for the creative team.|`|A122sKINaa	why not stop speculating and stating that it's "not gonna come back" and list reasons why it won't or why it's wise not to.      One of the biggest reason is this: The attitude era consisted of like 5 storylines with the same big names.    Austin vs McMahon (throw dude love in there somewhere)  Dx vs Nation of Domination (including rock vs hhh)  Undertaker vs. Kane (throw mankind in there somewhere)  Undertaker & Kane vs. Stone Cold  The Corporation vs Stone Cold    Nowadays, there is no competition for WWE, not even TNA. Supply and demand. When there's no demand, no supply. Why do they have to work hard when fans will take whatever is given to them? WWE doesn't have to centralize the storylines now. We are distracted by the smaller storylines now, rather than them helping create that tension for the "larger picture." Too many egos in the way for WWE to be centralized.|`|7BHIyMFmaa	They aren't. They realized that the Attitude Era was textbook example of short term gain / long tern loss. The would get a short term ratings boost with shock TV. However after a year or two the advertisers would leave in droves. Bischoff predicted that would happen. Unfortunately for Easy E, it took a bit longer than he had anticipated it would. But it did eventually happen.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	They cant. They dont have people with the star power today like Steve Austin that they did then. There is noone that can fit the mold, and the wrestler vs promoter angle has been worn out. I dont care what anyone says...Austin spearheaded that era, and everyone else who was there, the Rock included, just went along for the ride|`|855bpb3Caa	I assume you're referring to that petition another user posted on here.

Geez, most of their losses are from the weaker teams, then they can meet boston or cleveland in the finals and become 2009 champs|`|7t7XzXsVaa	A tough game against us the cavs can't wait. Anybody who has VIP seats to the game that night is ultra lucky!|`|4IDgCFWdaa	Nothing. All this means is Lakers have homecourt vs Celtics. A lot can happen between now and then. But what a confidence booster!|`|uxregJ0faa	To get the best record. Its means alot.|`|98wFqBwSaa	Another guy with initials in his user name?  Anyway, the Clevland is next and LA will not win.|`|2kgTdNRQaa	The CAVs will face their first home loss on Sunday.  Lakers are hot, without Bynum.|`|lMDy8W0Raa	Next? The Cavs go down at home and Leblow yells at his mom.|`|yTD84yFlaa	Champions.|`|fuYYRJXtaa	They will face an undefeated at home Cleveland team...    Man I can't wait!!!!! I know both Kobe & LeBron will put on a show!!    I really don't care who wins, as long as is a great competitive game!|`|ExVTrokAaa	We got the Cavs on Sunday...at Cleveland! its a big deal!|`|wXxJUnLJaa	The Spurs.|`|BfwzbKSoaa	Killing the Cavs home winning streak.|`|Cb5N6UaQaa	First, The Celtics, now the world!!!|`|fqycKwuQaa	The Cavs on sunday, which it will be another great game|`|dDhTMacAaa	a game against Cleveland...duh|`|ykNOlfvHaa	disney land fo sho
U3ZBUOWaaa	yeah that was funny...I mean MAYBE I could understand with beer and a minor etc...but the kid couldn't even POINT to the bottle he wanted????  That was funny.  Well he had a great attitude about it as did every one there.  Man I hope he does well this season.  I want to see that smile in victory lane!!!    Congrats to Jimmie...beating everyone from ALL FORMS of racing.....whoo hooo. THATS why NASCAR is the BEST!!!!!|`|AA11138176	I love it!  I like Joey he is a great kid and just wait and see he will be very good.He was awesome in Rockingham last year in Arca and give him time he will go on and be good.I have faith in him he is a good kid!|`|EfVlOfmYaa	Yea I laughed soo hard when I seen that! It was soo Hilarious   I don't know about Joey Logano bein rookie of the year but I can see why Jimmie was Performer of the year!|`|RLQdhFWXaa	Wasn't very surprised to see Jimmy Performer of the year. As for Joey getting his award was a little shocked.        Well, since he is underage I guess he wouldn't be able to pick up a empty beer bottle, kinda funny, but it was nice to see Zippy.|`|mIdcJEJNaa	I just don't get it.. I must be dense..  Lagono won in a car that just about couldn't lose, but in the long run, he brought the winning average of the car down..  Now if you disagree with what I saw, that's fine.. Look at this..  Cup: Lagano 113 points after three races, finished behind Mike Wallace 143 points in two races, John Andretti 149 points in three races, Kenny Wallace 166 points in two races, Boris Said 194 points in three races, Brad Keselowski 200 points in two races, and just check this out, Jon Wood, 183 points in three races.. He got beat by Jon Wood in points for three races apiece..  By the way, if Benny were still with us, he'd of talked NASCAR into using milk bottles for the drawing.. Missing Benny..  Jimmies award was a gimme', but well deserved..  PS: MY bad.. I found this NASCAR rules..  Drivers under 21 are not permitted to participate in formal activities relating to the race, such as the draw for position and other activities such as conferences related to the race because of the alcohol sponsorship. In those cases, the crew chief will participate in such activities.   Sorry Benny, I know you would have tried..|`|iO12Vjnvaa	Hilarious! If they are THAT concerned with keeping PC and not letting an underage driver pick out an empty bottle....why are they letting him be in the race to start with. Hmmmm good ol Nascar always contradicting themselves. Sounds about right.    Racer Magazine.....not really a respected award in my book...what's the perk? A full year's subscription?? Let's wait and see if he's on the stage in New York in November then I will call him a Rookie of the Year. I can agree with Johnson's award...but it should have Chad's name on it. I can't help but feel without Chad...Jimmie would be nothing.     Just an opinion as always.|`|739f14d79f8285fdffb364bed6c305feaa	^^^^Carl Edwards fan is reading my thoughts exactly^^^^^|`|YHYT8qMKaa	Yeah, I guess that was kind of funny. This makes me wonder why Joey is even allowed to be in the Budweiser Shootout to begin with. It reminds of when Kyle Busch wasn't allowed to be in a truck race in 2001 because Marlboro was sponsoring a CART race at the same track during the same weekend.     Logano did well in Nationwide, so I guess he deserves the award. However, I thought Scott Speed was very amazing as a rookie in ARCA last year. Jimmie Johnson is the man right now and it will take a lot of work for someone to stop him this year. He definitely deserves his award.|`|oHrE5RT3aa	jimmie johnson wouldn't hold a candle to Lewis Hamilton.|`|Ek1x32WHaa	Logano will "smoke" Scott Speed for ROY honors.    Hard to beat a 3x Champ.|`|eTaK695Faa	I think they should let Zippy drive the car in the Shootout as well.    To the other part of the question, Johnson not a surprise winning three championships in a row they kind of had to name him. Logano, I still don't think he is deserving all the press he is getting. I guess time will tell, but he should rookie of the year for 09, there is only one other driver eligible and that's Speed.|`|n55igpCUaa	No, I don't find it funny. Carl Edwards chose for David Reutimann, remember. Everyone was doing that.    Joey was rookie of the year IMO... until he got in over his head.|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	I think it was all for hype more than anything. The beer bottles were empty therefore I do not believe there would be anything wrong with him opening the bottle (and the girl was doing that)..................I think it was all a big spotlight to point out his youth.................    As far as Jimmie goes; anything he wins right now is legit and even though Logano is unproven and raw I think he will show everyone that he is much more than a bunch of hype........I will even go out on a limb (and yes it is crackling) and say that he will win a race this year......I can see the thumbs down coming now..........lolololol    Heck, somebody has to predict that he will win a race..............lolololol    Foxy Grandpa: What is keeping Lewis Hamilton from coming over and whipping up on the field???????
LzkujA3Faa	Hopefully they can sort it out before the tour to South Africa.|`|rnY99OrGaa	It will not happen by a day i think it's difficult to get back in to form after you lost many games.|`|tz7JEqstaa	Not much longer I hope.   I honestly believe we will win the Test series in SA.|`|ocPlxCIeaa	Every Team has they ups and downs,  Australia is still a good side and they will come back,  its just a matter of some Time.    Cheers !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AA11088802	they want two or three changes in batting order|`|XVYRUzkEaa	2 weeks|`|KyU7thGRaa	well by looking at the current playing stocks that the selectors have picked and discarded then re picked, id say a very long time, australia has started its process of sliding down the mountain, when the cricketing world laughed there heads off when we lost to a really non rated team....|`|cb9KqrUyaa	Every team has their players who go through slumps in their batting and now is obviously Mike Husseys time for his slump..I am hoping this is not going to last too much longer,hopefully with all this new blood in the team we can find some sort of stability.
qCkbjDHPaa	i saw it. his back foot was resting on his other foot and his toe didn't touch the ground|`|sGQbF431aa	http://s235.photobucket.com/albums/ee137...|`|QlrIUIfOaa	The call was correct.  Watch the replay and focus on the laces.  You can clearly see them react when he taps his toes.|`|4kdlE54Paa	I watched it over and over.  I would have not called it a TD.  I am unbiasedly speaking.  On top of that, why did Holmes not get the 15 yard penalty for a TD celebration.  Last time I checked, using a football as a prop is a penalty.  Those two calls make me really question the officiating.  When a game is that close, you can't make mistakes or forget a penalty commonly called in the regular season.  On top of that, the the Kurt Warner fumble should have been reviewed.  It was forward motion and an incomplete pass.    Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|H1VIZsutaa	Sadly, he did get it down, it was a perfect throw and catch.|`|30LMCJrAaa	They just see what they want to see.     Everyone knows the NFL shop sells more Steelers hats than Cards hats...it's a matter of economics, the refs knew it. Why else would the Cards win two reviews? The refs were told how the game was going to turn out.     Other than crappy officiating and Harrison assaulting a player on national television, I enjoyed the game....|`|7sVg9NPxaa	Loser. It must be that office you work in. See source.    NFL ONLY, NOT NCAA OR HS:  If the receiver gets pushed out of bounds with possession of the ball and his feet would have come down in bounds if not pushed, it's a reception.     TD either way.     LEARN THE RULES.|`|LVjM9k8yaa	Waaaaaaaaa!    It was down, Harrison scored and Warner fumbled. It's over, deal with it.    45-35  Enough Said!    Hook'em!!!|`|BZpF8nSsaa	he did get his tow down, it was pretty clear to.....we all saw it on NBCee it..cmon you cant argue with NBCee it....|`|E3wAsSjUaa	You can say whatever you want, but in the end it was ruled a TD.   Every clip I've seen of that play, I've seen a TD. He got both tip toes in.|`|xxtvhn5Naa	he did get his toe down... nice clean catch|`|bTXDb5YIaa	Stillas|`|aPDZzT9taa	yeah ithink the officials wanted to end hte game or they r blind his toe was on his other foot!!|`|yWcPOTsAaa	After further review, the play stands as called. It's in the history books. Maybe next year Ed Hochuli will ref the Super Bowl.|`|zqPjdhgKaa	OK...  use some common sense here.  You and other BIASED people claim to say Holmes did not have has feet down.  You are people that saw it on TV.  Now, everyone knows most TV analysts hate the Steelers, in particular John Madden.  If his foot was not down then it would have come out and been the biggest story this last week.  Everyone would be griping about it, especially John Madden.  Also, we know that when there is a bad officiating call that the opposing team disagrees with, they send a letter to the head of the NFL.  This did not occur, and Whisenhunt knew it was a touchdown.  Use some common sense and stop dealing with conspiracy theories that have no basis and have been proven countless times to be false.     The Steelers won the game fair and square.  You might want to consider seeking an eye doctor if you truly believe he didn't have both feet down.|`|MPDgKgIxaa	Touch Down.    http://americanfootballtopics.blogspot.c...  http://americanfootballpredictions.blogs...|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	Are you kidding? His toe was definitely down. No doubt about it. It was reviewed and everything.|`|Ko4y7eVUaa	I was all for the cards in that one man, but he DID have his toe down. At first, it was only one, but as he kept moving, the other touched the ground. Sorry for both of us, but it was legit.|`|8ImkKoNEaa	did you see on espn news tonite, the refs said they would have flagged his td celebration? funny how it's the thursday after the superbowl!  hey kids it's alright to get busted with possession you'll be an mvp!|`|Ky99KA8Raa	i saw it during the game steelers were paying off the refs|`|T51pHg2Paa	If anyone actually zoomed in on a good quality hdtv he clearly had one of his feet wrapped around the other.and not on the ground.|`|YCwmCDkUaa	What a bunch of crybabies...his toes were both down.  If you watch it, you can even see his foot 'bend' as he was catching it.    It's funny that you are giving thumbs down to people who don't agree with you even if they were Cardinal fans...    It was a TD....Steelers won...end of story.    As for you "seeing his junk" that's sounds like a personal issue.  ------------  the Warner fumble WAS a fumble...the ball was out before he started forward...    If the refs were "pro-Steelers" then why the hell would they have called the holding in the end zone with under 3 minutes left resulting in a safety?...Holmes made the catch and the Steelers would have been able to run out the clock then...    morons...|`|AA10315681	Oh well see I remember watching that game/Super Bowl play and I Really don't think that his toe was actually down at all because I remember watching the Instant Replay and even though everybody thought that his toe was down it wasn't at all when he actually caught and had the ball in his arms at the end of that play.Now don't get me wrong I still do think that Santonio Holmes is a Very good player and everything But I don't think that he made that catch/completion in the endzone.
kFcdwVwdaa	it was a great game and a great defensive play last couple of plays on both sides. ray allen isn't as clutch as he thinks he is. nobody touched him when he shot the ball and he did throw his feet out as to get a call. but it was a good no call like you said. they showed a couple of different angles on the last shot and nobody touched him|`|Vx9Lvt9Aaa	noooo......LAKERS SHOWED GREAT DEFENSE|`|182c6604bba959c84026ef7306cf79bbaa	the rer choked|`|EiPdBAaeaa	Hell no, fisher didn't foul him! It was great defense.|`|TIwQCBGiaa	No Fish had the arm bar on him and Ray actually tried to push of when I saw it closely..Good no-call! No way u call that at the end unless D Fish extends his arm.|`|mbkJjQY9aa	no way there was no foul on that play and only Boston f@gg0ts will tell you there was|`|39RKmCKRaa	No way... It was an extremely physical game and the game should never be decided by the refs calls. Besides all the Boston Celtics are floppers!!!!|`|KdhNCnEjaa	He hooked him but it was not serious enough to warrant a foul at that point in the game.    Nobody likes a game that ends on free throws, including me|`|H7AcXAyaaa	No.|`|urqGJPwpaa	Lol, no foul at all.  You will get every Boston fan saying it was a foul.  If I thought it was a foul, I'd say so.  Every analyst/broadcaster said it WAS NOT! a foul.      Sunday is going to be insane.  I'm glad the Lakers get 2 days rest, able to prepare for LeBron!  Hopefully Kobe plays better than he did today that's for sure.|`|98wFqBwSaa	He definitely did a reach in foul.    I look forward to Sunday.    Cavs will win.    Learn how to write questions.|`|n6514FLVaa	no celdicks are sore losers!|`|15ffd7adf8caf120b0a8331ff718983baa	No way in hell. But last year in that playoff game against San Antonio where Brent Barry got fouled by Fish, THAT Was a foul.|`|vJyF8siJaa	great defence like what you said. no foul.|`|jz0Mpbmdaa	it looked like he was tripped and fell into him  to bad they don't have instant replay|`|WYMsOPOhaa	No    Yes    and Lakers have a tendency of breaking streaks (Cavs Home Streak)

For some reason he just seems a bit unbalanced. Sure it makes for good ratings, but he has to be a good heal if he gets under the skin of a television viewer.     As for Face(s), I am going for an oldie, but my favorite tag team of all time. No not Billy and Chuck (ha ha), but instead, The Smokin' Gunns. I always thought it was an awesome gimmick of two cowboys coming in and tearing the place to waste. I know they became heels then broke up, but you have to admit. The Smokin' Gunns were a good tag team.

L5tWiYOFaa	Kevin's answer is open to interpretation, because Dario Gradi moved upstairs to become a technical director in 2007 at Crewe ALEXANDRA(!), and in his second spell only took a caretaker role (the incumbent is Gudjon Thordarson), and if I've interpreted the question correctly, the longest serving manager of present is indeed Sir Alex Ferguson. Second would be Graham Turner of Hereford, followed by Arsene Wenger in third.  Longest serving manager of all time in English football - Jimmy Davies of Waterloo Dock FC, 45 years and 70+ trophies!|`|V5ASfdVbaa	Thank you its Alex|`|41m6RZ4Jaa	i reckon arsene wenger|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	Arsene Wenger|`|L1QTSErIaa	If you are talking about the top flight football, it's Wenger.

Alex ferguson has been with Man u since 1986- until the present day, were as Dario Gradi was with Crewe for 24 years from 1983-2007|`|K0TEZbLOaa	currently, in the premiership. Arsene Wenger|`|YjlGVmQraa	Dario Gradi and Sir Matt Busby have both spent more time at the helm. While Gradi is at Crewe Alexandra, a Coca Cola League one team, Busby managed United between 1945 and 1969
3teWTOPqaa	I think with Bynum back it will be some help, but I wouldn't overestimate Andrew's effectiveness after coming off an major injury.    Personally Lakers played better than Boston the entire game, but the free throws really killed us, we should have ended it in the 4th quarter as well.|`|jHJ0W9QNaa	yes, my Celtics played poorly. the Lakers are a better team... for now.    good game Lakers. as a Celtics fan, you earned my respect. i won't be a sore loser and i'll give Kobe Bryant the credit he deserves.|`|7Xridrxaaa	GO LAKERS!!|`|2kgTdNRQaa	I don't know about Tarzan!

WE WILL SEE.|`|tBuzrlSdaa	Good game, but I dont think it will be a blow out but maybe 10 point win or something|`|rs6TLnIMaa	LA will never blow the Celtics out.   Ever.|`|H8FHx1HYaa	lets see|`|0tTHoyktaa	our image is the best team in the lueage. I imagine that we would have killed them like we did on christmas with Bynum. But, i think we won this one cuz Garnett fouled out.|`|38634d724472d6d2e903c2fa2cae8951aa	Bynum has always performed horribly against the C's. KG dominates him everytime. You guys are actually better without him. LA is not capable of blowing out the C's. Even when Boston plays lousy the game is still close... like tonight - 110-109 in OT.    Game 1 was a good game in LA and the Lakers took it clean.    Game 2 was ugly and the refs were worse. Don't expect calls like that everytime. The call that fouled out Garnett was the worst I've seen since last season.    Keep in mind KG was still recovering from the flu. He will be 100% come finals time. I can't wait for the rematch.|`|xhHfXuKFaa	if they meet in the finals every game will be a nail biter.|`|uxregJ0faa	Yea Bynum will give us a push. I dont know about a blowout but Bynum will sure help on Defense
GIVarsPnaa	Sort of except Yao is more dominant.|`|q2EafutHaa	Skill wise they are very different. Injury prone they are very similar. They're just too big and it's much easy to suffer injuries with that size.|`|teSCVfRoaa	Nope not even close.|`|AA11455646	Hmmmm....I don't know if you could use the two as a comparison.  Ming falls apart on his own doing, thus far Bynum has been injured by others running into him.    Their totally different players, so it is hard to compare their talent.  Ming is just big and works like a clug.  While Bynum is more athletic and has a team that doesn't rely on him so it is hard to say what he can really do.|`|yH21F6Dlaa	no because bynum has talent yao is terrible how can you be the tallest player in the nba and not have a carrer average of 10 rebs a game really|`|AQmcZ0gYaa	No he just Bynum, Greg Oden and him would be a better comparison, big and fragile!!!|`|i5MInqeMaa	Injury wise he is getting there.  Yao messed up each foot in a different season and bynum messed up each knee in a different season.|`|aaKYVMk2aa	Good comparison.|`|6chLhNJhaa	Sorta...he's big and gets hurt but isnt as good as yao.|`|tY3rZSsiaa	i guess you could say that injury wise.  oden would be in the same category but he seems to be healthy this year, well see how that plans out.|`|GwawzO5Faa	No.|`|Lj0d5vIJaa	haha great comparison by far|`|AukGqk17aa	NO    He will be like CAMBY    HE is the new marcus camby|`|esJIq39saa	well you can see the talen arising but just like yao he gets hurt. bynum gonna be a NBA Allstar foreal if he can stay healthy. and i bet hes gonna get a title before yao any bets against. look at bynum's team. and everybody knows if you have a good team you look good. true! watch out for him|`|bmL7Ryw2aa	Unfortunately, being big like that increases the chances of getting hurt.  Plus, it had already been diagnosed when Bynum first came into the league that he would probably suffer some knee injuries because he's big and bowlegged.|`|56Mb4BXIaa	no, yao ming is chinese|`|sCiuv7n3aa	No...    It's HILARIO NENE    TALENTED BIG MEN... prone to injuries
b9C8CKo1aa	Its fate that Sachin shud break all the records possible...Now i Belive he is the Player with Most number of Wrong Dismissals....;)|`|RGxMkT0zaa	There is a limit to human error.  Players miss a ball, he is out.  Umpires miss to see what he should, he should forfeit Match fees or be given a ban.  Or change the judgment and let batsman return to bat.    3 times he " misses"  seeing Tendulkar was OK or not, is too much.  he did it to Yuvi in last match. Had he done it in this match, Yuvi would have killed him. Saw his eyes.  So he got scared of yuvi. This said Commentators of DD, not me.     So D'Silva did a Hat trick of Human error. Congrats to him and SL for it.|`|f46e40cfc0dd6c8bb80ff83f005fc521aa	Because umpires have only normal eyes,not hawk eyes.|`|b7f6b1292b666a974a7a9c247d278b21aa	It was not intentional like SBW against Tendulkar in Australia.

EDIT  and to answer to your edit,  Are these bowlers "World beaters"???    well I think some of them will give South Africa a hard time...after all,look at what the likes of Ishant and Harbhajan did to that top batsmen(you know the bloke who likes to be the fifth umpire..) of the ICC ranked team no 2.|`|bHheiqY6aa	What do you mean?  We are living in a most advanced world and you are talking about luck!!    Australia the world champions lost to bangladesh in ODI. Do you think bangladesh got luck that day? Also Australia lost to Zimbabwe in T20 world cup match. What do you think?  Australia got a very good pace attack that time and doesn't mean they win all the matches.  So, even if dhoni have a average bowling attack, his strategy and bowling change depends on time is winning matches. It is not luck!!

Can't bear the fact that a poor country is getting names in the newspaper every now and then, can you?  Well, India is a large country with needs for so many things. Complete development will take its time. But how long can you deny the importance of India? Maybe a decade or two, and we will be definitely up there among the best in every sphere. But, I am sure, you can't bear a poor country rising to recognition, can you? Well, we have a term that starts with "R" for those feelings, if you know what I mean. ;) enjoy your day.

MTbgg5eyaa	For a guy like him, you expect more.  The rebounds, the points, the assists, he is just so consistent at being inconsistent.    That guy could be a franchise player if he wanted to (well, in fact he was, during his clipper days). He is long and wide and can play you anytime.    He has the hands and quickness of a point guard.  The eyes and dribbles of a shooting guard.  The length and superiority of a forward.  He can go anywhere from 1 to 4.    Once he gets consistent in being consistent, then I'll shut up about him.    Right now, it's just about exceeding expectations.|`|xhHfXuKFaa	i know. i was thinking how this season vs boston hes been clutch.|`|uxregJ0faa	His consistency. I hope he watches the halftime reports when they start bashing him and fire him up to play.     I think he saw what Karl Malone said and took it personally. He should do this every game|`|3teWTOPqaa	Well there is something called consistency that he is lacking. He played great games this season, twice against the Celtics, but he needs to step it up and be more aggressive.    also I really think Odom lacks heart, the intensity for the game. If he can be more intense like K.G, maybe he can take his game to another level.|`|15ffd7adf8caf120b0a8331ff718983baa	I've always liked LO.|`|aUGM3ju6aa	Dude odom is good.

I like Odom on Lakers I hope he gets championship this year he deserves it|`|TUJlPcGLaa	Real cool Laker fans don't whine about Odom.

If he play scrappy and confident like tonight vs Boston he should stay a Laker 4 life.|`|clgc86Voaa	I always thought he was a key player on the Lakers. He struggled in the first half with only two points, but than he became a monster at the second half. What unleashed that monster was KG talkin and talkin trash. ha. Got fouled out. Eat your words KG you made LO mad and you paid for it.|`|45e71bc8ca903cd0b9c0e4294eff6f04aa	omg no way has he come up big in big games.  this game was a good game by him in the 2nd half but you saw it from everyone.  he doesn't step up all the time and always seems lax.    he could be so much better than he is now but he is just...lamar.    and god it was a blessing he made both those freethrows because i cant tell you how many times ive seen him miss ft's for the win.|`|8aDJJGJMaa	I hate how he cant finish his shots which annoys the ******* **** out of me but if i would hate anybody on the lakers it would be Pau Gasol. He is probably the most overrated plalyer in the NBA.

LVrH8W57aa	1- that would Randy Orton, everyone and i mean almost everyone loves, i don't really know why, i find him boring on both the mic and the ring but thats just me i guess, Orton is probably the future of WWE and after 8 yrs in WWE ( including development teretory) he has proved his loyalty, well like i said the IWC likes Orton a lot, and thats why i think he the most overrated wrestler today on the net.  last year it was Kennedy .. and people still overrate this guy    2- The Undertaker, it;s actully hard NOT to like him, he is almost flawless, and thats where i think he can get a litle overrated, about a year ago, i did a "best wrestler ever tournament" and he won it, It's not Angle defenetly, Sting also hasn't been in WWE to be good with their "loyaltist" , bret hart has as much as haters as fans... so it's taker|`|GJQIL0RZaa	John Cena|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Orton I'd say right now. Everyone loves him, and people that werent fans of him before, are slowly starting to gain respect for him, because his promos seem less scripted now and hes really improved on his character. CM Punk is a close second, since alot of internet fans know him from his ROH days.    All time is probably Bret Hart. He retired and kept his word on never making the Montreal Screwjob into an angle, basically selling out for money. He kept his word. I would also say Chris Benoit. Before he murdered his family, he was the ultimate IWC golden child, and to some fans, still is.|`|41WXZPnCaa	Sup     Well    2day's Golden Boy It's ........

1a43afb42ab31b9a50f33e93db671368aa	I have an even better reason to stop eating Kelloggs products -- I refuse to support their hypocrisy and double standards.    In other words, the so-called concern about their "wholesome" image is inconsistent with the fact that many of their "wholesome" products list sugar as a primary ingredient.    As always, I fail to understand why some physically harmful, mood-altering substances (sugar, chocolate, tobacco, coffee, high fructose corn syrup) are acceptable, while others are not.  If you don't believe me, just try disabling the coffee machine at your job when nobody's looking.  Talk about people who can't function without their morning "fix" ...|`|TwcAQPupaa	I agree with the message Kellogg's is sending, so, yes.  I will continue to eat Kellogg's products.  I support their decision and hopefully Phelps will learn from this error in judgement and do what he can to re-gain the respect the youth athletes.|`|Slbt3UPxaa	No, I may eat even more Kelloggs.  It was an idiotic move on his part.|`|yS5f1XLFaa	i dunno... probably not. but they shouldnt have stopped cuz many ppl still look up 2 michael phelps, myself included.|`|T6qf95eZaa	Seriously i was going to ask the same question.  I am definitly boycotting kellog's for pulling their sponsor, i mean if you really think about it how many potheads are out there eating frosted flakes right now?  i for one will never be that.  General Mills should just call phelps up and tell him they are making razor suit marshmellows for lucky charms and slap that picture of phelps blazin right on the box.|`|rqs2xgNjaa	no, that's crazy.  and if they dropped him because of his recent episode, it's crazy.  so many celebs have sponsors and they even know they do drugs and what not, but they still keep em' around.  phelps is human. im still a big fan, of him, and kelloggs, special k all the way !|`|AA11914978	No, I'll buy and eat more! Phelps is a dumb (and very rich) kid who had everything at his feet and has screwed it up for himself. He did something illegal and should be punished the same as anyone else, just 'cos he's a national hero doesn't make him above the law. And of course its right that sponsors like Kellogg's drop him, they want their products to be associated with good health and Phelps sucking on a bong aint the way to do that is it? If he gets a life ban from the international swimming community it wouldn't bother me but it would help those athletes coming up behind him learn from the lesson!  He's stupid on two counts; 1 for doing it and 2 for getting caught doing it.

HEgcqXZVaa	Between 1995 and now, there have been 833 reported sky diving fatalities worldwide.  In 2008 there were 61 reported deaths, 32 of these being in the United States.    As for the parachutes.  Main Parachute- 0.1% of the time, meaning about 1 out of 1000 jumps.  The risk of both parachutes failing is over 1 in a million.    There are other reasons that people die sky diving.  The estimation is about 1 in 80,000 sky divers will die. Most people die from sky diving because of human error, with fully functional parachutes.     For continued reading on sky diving fatalities and parachute malfunctions please check my sources.|`|AA10244155	everything you do can  kill you but sky diving is safer than driving a car|`|60c7b85533ff654ef788c2cbd51c8788aa	VERY dangerous...if your chutes don't open.    ...could ruin your whole day.|`|XeVQcVgQaa	The jump can only end 2 ways    1. you land safely    2. you die|`|EffQwkVQaa	i would say chances are very low for something going wrong. it has to be really really really safe for people to be able to do it. have fun if youre going. ive always wanted to go.|`|072ec6314e7821ba149c4a9346652af3aa	I read somewhere that about 55 people died last year in skydiving accidents worldwide... not too bad.

CXOs4mAEaa	Take a look here,it may be a start...  http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/...
kJcxe01Laa	First advantage is that they aren't as dangerous. Give an MLB player an aluminum bat and all those pitchers hit with line drives would currently be six feet underground. Additionally, they add so much to the game. Final scores would be 34-28 if aluminum bats were used. Instead we get base hits, sacrifices, etc. It's just a more diverse game.    Unfortunately, they shatter. I saw firsthand a huge piece of wooden bat fly into pitcher Rick Helling's arm. They are also more expensive.|`|aPDZzT9taa	more distance when hit with but and stronger in a way but will break if not hit at a strong point|`|GChKzEilaa	advantage solid distance   disadvantage heavier than metal bat|`|fJCYDSEsaa	They are less dangerous in the hands of a power hitting minor or major leaguer.|`|bXn6WGaXaa	Wooden bats are more likely to break, but they don't produce the same BESR numbers as aluminum or composite bats. That's a measure of how far the ball rebounds from the bat. Aluminum bats transfer energy much more efficiently than wooden bats do, so the exit speed of the ball is much higher. The ball travels faster and farther. Hank Aaron's record (sorry, can't recognize Bonds as HR champ) would fall in less time than it took to write this answer.|`|gzRZlfpLaa	it can be corked      ....... |....  ........|........ASK SOSA.......|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)  --------------------IM A MACK---------------
4IDgCFWdaa	I didn't see a foul. I even kept rewinding in on my dvr and still didn't see anything. I did however like ray allens ballerina dance in midair as he took his shot.|`|2kgTdNRQaa	No foul.  Gasol blocked Allens shot.  It was a soft block, just enough to change the ball's trajectory and that was all the Lakers needed.  Ray Allen flopped trying to get a foul.  Sorry ace.|`|yTD84yFlaa	It looked like a fisher foul; not gasol.  Still a great game, and the refs were right not to call it.|`|lMDy8W0Raa	Those are only excuses|`|wXxJUnLJaa	No whistle, no foul.|`|BfwzbKSoaa	No foul.  Derek Fisher was the closest to him and I saw the play clearly, Fisher's hands didn't touch him.|`|ykNOlfvHaa	nah d fish fouled him|`|vJyF8siJaa	clean play, you can be the judge if you see it.|`|TolT8FP7aa	OH ! bunch of cry baby celtics. they play dirty and when someone touches them a little they go crying foul! foul! waaa waaaa|`|0pbQg0Ohaa	I think he foulded him with a reach on his way to the shot but Glen Davis shouldent have passed the ball to him anyway.|`|WYMsOPOhaa	No foul, Gasol block|`|Fs7rCHO9aa	No foul. The only thing that could possibly had been called is when the ball was passed back to Allen and there was some contact with Fisher. After that it was all Allen. Gasol was at least 3 feet away from him when he blocked it.|`|i1jburIzaa	First of all there was at lest 50 other fouls not called so why start then. And second how often do refs call a foul for the last shot of the game.|`|38634d724472d6d2e903c2fa2cae8951aa	Yes. Even the unbiased radio announcers were calling for it.    If there hadn't been so many other rotten calls, I wouldn't have cared as much. When the C's lost to LA in LA they just lost. Period.     This game was frustrating to watch. KG's 6th foul? Garbage. Even the TNT announcers said it.|`|nBjrtIqeaa	I saw a clean SMACK followed by a cowardly and desperate flop by Ray the choker Allen.    Lakers win baby! A regular season sweep of the Celtics feels so good.|`|e79e40d0999dacde34958e53ec461fc2aa	I didn't see it. Im a Lakers Fan, but I thought that Lakers might not win this one.|`|JF1lHRExaa	It was actually Bynum.  He slid over on his crutches and tripped ray allen in mid air.
BiMkowVMaa	Happy Birthday Mike,    Thats a great present the Lakers delivered to you.    I'd have to say its a tie. Gasol and Odom had a lot to prove as this Lakers team is basically the one that played the Celts in the Finals (no Bynum). Both Lamar and Pau had to show that they won't back down and show some toughness. They both made huge plays down the stretch with Odom hitting those clutch free throws... and us Lakers fans know about Odom's shaky free throw shooting, yet he came through. Pau had a steller shooting and rebounding night, yet his biggest play was shadowing Ray Allen and blocking that last shot.    Those two came through, we knew Kobe was going to come through in the fourth and the with defensive plays in OT, but those two had a lot to prove so I have to give it to them.|`|l0iCqzlQaa	happy birthday senor|`|98wFqBwSaa	Happy birthday now what question man?|`|NEtVRjplaa	awww Happy Birthday!|`|TLZ3GEEXaa	What's up Y!A...    I just got back from the sports bar watching that game... Who knew it would go into OT. It looked like the Lakers played better... They went to Boston with the same lineup as in the NBA Finals and they came out proving something once again. The Lakers are good, even without Bynum.    That was a great game, Celtics played hard too...|`|sCHUFUXsaa	Happy Bday!

And Happy 19th birthday.|`|wXxJUnLJaa	Cool|`|clgc86Voaa	I say the player of the game were both Gasol and Odom. They needed to step up and they did it a big way. Gasol showed toughness and Odom drove into the basket all the way and hit the game winning free throws. Great game and what a present the Lakers gave you. I hope that you got something big happening in June because we need that championship.|`|L0ft1eo7aa	happy Bday what u got|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	I think Pau Gasol played great today getting the loose balls and scoring afterwards.|`|ykNOlfvHaa	happy birthday playa|`|e79e40d0999dacde34958e53ec461fc2aa	Happy BDAY!    that's cool that LA won on your BDAY...

I was happy for the xmas day gift as well. I unfortunately missed the first 3 quarters since I was playin' ball at the gym and forgot to set my DVR. But the 4th and overtime was really a team effort. Its hard to say just one person. Although it should have been an easy win for the Lakers if they could have just made their free throws!
mTSOJKlyaa	he should have been ejected from the game    plain and simple|`|YkseyT7zaa	The officiating was terrible, however the Cardinals had the game and couldn't stop the Steelers when it counted.    It did not change the outcome. The very last play pass/fumble wouldn't/shouldn't of been a factor either if they had just held them to 4 downs|`|aaKYVMk2aa	J..Jail time for that? Is this a joke? It was classless and definitely uncalled for, but jail time?|`|d5368f798fac0323fe025ec0d32f5be6aa	he didnt punch him. it was like a hard push and held him down. then he blocked him. he didnt grad him or anything. it was over the top but thats steeler football. smashmouth your face in.|`|63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	mainly it was the SB  any other game during the regular season he more than likely would of.. that was well after the play and uncalled for...more than likely it cost not only the SB MVP.. it should cost him some money as in fines.|`|AA10939368	There were three altercations during this game, are you naive enough to believe that there was no other punching going on.  Hines Ward got decked last season, that player was not ejected.  By the way Gandy pulled Harrison's facemask twice and it was not called.  Now let's talk about Wilson plowing down Berger, the place holder when he was in a defenseless position.|`|YRsCMVvnaa	Because it was a little push. Jail time for something like that? Not likely. You're overreacting. The Cards lost...get over it.|`|489d315755dd3d36b1b400515759a73caa	Well, with the referees making the bad calls that they did most of the game I would say they were on the Steelers side or maybe payroll.  Maybe thats why the owner thanked O'bama in his comments after the game as he needs a bailout now also to payoff the ref's...    i agree and when John Madden even makes a comment about it that it was totally unprofessional and only received a penalty flag and not tossed from the game?  That is also why they kept showing him on the sidelines after that play as I think the camera man was appalled by what he saw also.  Along with being shown on National TV this actions makes Hockey fights look like figure skating as at least when they fight both men are standing facing each other and not facedown on the ground..    I wish they could even keep his name from appearing on the SuperBowl trophy now for his actions. Imagine the example he is setting for the kids that watch the game now??|`|WgcT04JGaa	Does anyone remember during the regular season 2 guys having an actual fist fight in the middle of the field? Does anyone know if this guy laid a cheap shot on Harrison to provoke this action? All we know is that Harrison got caught hitting the guy, yes it was uncalled for, but it happened and it was handled the way the professionals felt was the correct way to handle it. We make it sound like he is the only one to ever do anything like this before in any game, this is not a tea party it is a violent sport where tempers as well as footballs fly.|`|zFNOaDAYaa	Sitting in jail ?!!! are you kidding me ? It was a love tap. Football is a physical sport. Harrison is a physical player.|`|GtR8WaI5aa	You know what, i believe that all these tensions were high and even the cardinals players were letting their emotions get to them.  I know that if it would have been other teams in the super bowl, the same thing would have happened.  Just because you will never play football doesnt mean you can just think the best defense player in the league needs to be kicked out.  John Lynch use to knock people on there *** all the time and hit harder than anyone i know.  So harrison shouldnt have been kicked out, even though the refing was horrible|`|WmTQmW0Xaa	He should have been ejected from the game. You can't do that I can't believe they let him get away with it.|`|esJIq39saa	are you guys kidding me?lol he was puching the heck out the dude. looked to see was the ref looking and shoved him. defensive player of the year or what ejection should have been called for. though that brings up another question whos side was the refs on? true! tell me if im wrong

BZpF8nSsaa	lol the probowl is as boring as pre-season games...enough said|`|E3wAsSjUaa	I could care less about the Pro Bowl.   Just a big ole' popularity contest.|`|RS3fjNboaa	LOL!!!!!!!! I have never seen anyone so excited about the pro bowl. Good luck, man. I hope your conference wins.|`|YPQTXOQ5aa	Why??? It is not football, it a bunch of guys collecting a nice check and trying not to get hurt|`|xxtvhn5Naa	Naw. The Pro Bowl has turned into nothing but a popularity contest. About 5 or 10 years ago, when you said someone went to the Pro Bowl 7 times, you where like WOW! But now its just like, yeah whatever. And they've put to many rules on it. Like the one that you can't blitz the QB. I mean cummon. There are usually 3 or 4 players that go to the Pro Bowl just because they are good as rushing the QB, and most of those players can't cover to save their lives. So, they go to the Pro Bowl, and they aren't allowed to rush the QB. So that forces them to drop back in coverage, which they stink at. So those players who are really good, stink in the Pro Bowl. And there's also a rule that says the DBs can't "press cover" unless the offense is inside the 10 yard line. So in the last Pro Bowl, one of the NFCs WRs caught the ball and got tackled at the 11 yard line. So, the CB for the AFC couldn't press cover the WR, and the NFC got a TD.|`|yLTDUZIDaa	I like to watch it, even if the refs let tackle block go... I hate that.|`|mFtSBujqaa	That's like the least exciting football game out there.  Seriously.  NFL players don't even like to watch the probowl.|`|AA10315681	I am SO looking forward to watching the NFL Pro Bowl this weekend(Sunday) because three of my Most Favorite players(Ed Reed,Ray Lewis,& Charles Woodson) are going to be playing in this years Pro Bowl this season and Really hope that their team wins this year because I think that they all(Reed,Lewis,& Woodson) all might be on the same team this year.|`|Nzk70xVwaa	Brees got hurt last year so they're probably going to crack down even more on the rules this time.|`|CELHea69aa	The Pro Bowl ?

AA11097612	I agree with you.  This Super Bowl had way too many penalties and both offenses were sloppy and boring until the 4th quarter.  Super Bowl 32 was exciting throughout the game.      I still think that Super Bowl 43 was exciting but Super Bowl 32 was better.|`|d065d40a6781127c80dc5959554a2d4faa	Here are some better ones    Giants vs Patriots  Patriots vs Rams  Patriots vs Panthers  Rams vs Titans    Those, in no particular order, are way better than this SuperBowl. Super Bowl 43 wasn't even good until the last 10 minutes of the 4th quarter and the game was blown by officials and people in the upstairs. The Steelers got away with a lot of BS and that clearly tainted this game.    The terrible roughing the passer call. Harrison probably didn't get in for the touchdown. Harrison should have been kicked out of the game for beating the heck out of the guy. The missed excessive celebration call. The review that never happened.|`|jLOCqhckaa	The game was rigged! The Steelers are firkin cheaters any game was better than the crap that was aired on Sunday night. Nuff said!|`|fHxpycJSaa	Every year, the media, led by the booyahs at ESPN, declare it as the greatest game ever, with the greatest play ever, blah, blah, blah. Next years game will be the best ever, when it gets here.|`|9Zbh8HZxaa	WHO EVER TOLD YOU THAT S.B. 43 WAS THE BEST IS ON CRACK. THEN WHY WAS IT THE LEAST WATCH S.B. IN THE LAST 12 YEARS.THE SHOW WIPEOUT HAD MORE VIEWERS   1,000,043 WATCHED THE S.B  1,239,016 WATCHED WIPEOUT|`|wbIEau0qaa	the broncos vs packers would have been the best if brett favre couldve made a comeback. since he didnt, then its really not a best super bowl|`|wxXguyK3aa	I think 43 was the best.  After that, 42 (Giants fan).  Maybe if I saw 32 I would think differently, but out of all the Super Bowls I saw, 43 was the best.
wXxJUnLJaa	The better team won tonite!  It was a great game, & really fun to watch.  Nail bitter!|`|tBuzrlSdaa	I agree with you bro very good game! I thought we will lose at the end too but we pulled thru!  Edit: My heart was pounding pretty hard at end of 4th and ot and I had to bite my nails couldnt stop lol was scared they might make last shot|`|BfwzbKSoaa	Really great game. I didn't like Garnett's or Rondo's attitudes today though. Truly Truly scary and intense.    Pierce did a nice job shutting down Kobe, but you can't stop him in the 4th quarter, him and his clutchness.|`|Cb5N6UaQaa	It could have gone either way cause it was a close game from start to finish. I think neither team really play to their potential. If the Celtics can;t win even when the Lakers shot 59% from the FT line they are in trouble. Plus Bynum was out, so Celtics I think have to do some changes for sure if they wanna compete.|`|Vx9Lvt9Aaa	this game showed who the best team was......'    away at boston  no bynum   not hitting free throw    and still pulled it out    this was a great game and i hope the momentum carries over and handles the cavs on sunday        great game....|`|i0Igqvroaa	man every play down the stretch was just so intense. you just cant leave your couch. but great game for both teams, but the officiating a little off tonight. but congrats LAKERS!|`|n6514FLVaa	good game, close and had a playoff atmosphere! GO LAKERS 2009 CHAMPS!|`|TLZ3GEEXaa	Same, I watched it at a sports bar and that was a real close game... But the Lakers managed to keep with the Celtics all game...|`|udljXleZaa	GO LAKERS!!!

But anyway it was a good game. Important game too because it was a tie breaker.    Exciting game to watch. Was really nervous thats how good it was|`|2kgTdNRQaa	The Lakers "managed" to win, even in a poorly officiated game.  But I'll take the win anytime.  Next:  Smother the CAVs on Sunday.|`|98wFqBwSaa	In my opinion, the refs failed to call a reach in on Derek Fisher in the last 3 seconds.|`|l0iCqzlQaa	agree with you mamba great game officials could have been better but hey its a  hard job    hopefully see you in the 09 finals|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Unbelievable game. Lakes really got lucky missing 12 from the stripe on the road. Now I have been a Laker fan since most people around here weren't even thought of yet, and  I got the feeling the refs did there best to give this one to the Lakers. But I'm not taking anything away from the boys. Odom came to life after KG "tried" to intimidate him and that was clutch for us. Great victory.|`|P93I8CHtaa	great game,lakers just snapped another one of the celtics' winning streaks
4plmaU3Naa	grass, without a doubt. bounce is sometimes CRAZY and the ball sorta skids    worst surface not on ur list is carpet and wood (yes i have played on hardwood court) NOT FUN ball takes crazy bounces and skids worse then grass i can tell y they never use it in the pros!    (carpet yes; wood no) (although i believe carpet was taken out of Paris masters in 07)|`|N9KhTEKCaa	Hard - very fast  Clay - slow  Grass - awkward|`|aTBs7pJ4aa	well all of them are a little different and affect different playing styles..    grass use to be the fastest court. but now the grass has slowed down, some have said it is similar to clay... but the difference still is on grass the ball is more of a dead bounce and it will stay lower..    clay.. alot of high bounces and slower moving speed of the ball...     hardcourt the fastest surface.. but the ball bounces better then on grass|`|jcHFKHvoaa	Hard, Cause the ball is fast and its harder to hit it because of the energy transfer of the ball to the racket.|`|8qtm4qkUaa	Depends on two things:    1) your game. For Pete Sampras, clay was the hardest surface to play well on, for instance, and grass was his best.    2) exactly what you mean by 'most difficult'. I think for all the players, hardcourts are tougher on their bodies and take more out of them. So physically, they are harder to play on over time, though in any single match they give a good true bounce and provide an even contest between baseliners and serve-volley players.|`|75ZMWlnnaa	it is different for everyone.  personally for me, i love playing on grass and hard because the ball moves pretty quick and the bounce is good for my game.    i HATE clay because it is so slow and it benefits those that are physically fit and have lots of endurance.|`|IMwvaKkKaa	Grass, cause the bounce is awkward and low. and clay, cuz it goes way slower and bounces higher.|`|j5fNBBi9aa	It all depends on your game...I HATE Grass and Clay cuz the surface slows the ball down...I like to play fast paced and hard hitting which suits hard court....but it all depends on how you play|`|pddwVjALaa	I think grass. Because it cannot bounce well. Also because grass is difficult to play on and move around easily.  The game goes by awkwardly.       Then clay. Because it bounces really high and fast.     HARD IS THE  BEST    NADAL FOREVER!    and federer|`|yYQsfnVGaa	I've played on all 3 different surfaces and i have to say that clay is really difficult for me to play on. I've played on it longer than any other surface, and i still haven't mastered being a clay-courter. yeah, it really is lame of me, that's why i've been focusing on it more.|`|gcer6GpGaa	each type of surface has its own different qualities. the bounce, speed, and spin for each one is different so its pretty up what your used to. its your opinion
eff7c5bf6219b25d24a130be10287a20aa	I think the Celtics would. The Lakers and the Cavs are their main opponents, and only the Cavaliers and the Magic can make a run for the best record in the East, but the Magic will fall soon w/o Nelson and the Cavs will probably lose to the Celtics by a couple of games for the home court advantage. I don't see the Lakers really getting the best record in the league although they will be the best team in the league.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	Lakers!!|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	If they're tied for best record then it goes to the Lakers. Otherwise it goes to the team with the better record.|`|ExVTrokAaa	the Team that finished the Regular season with the best record.|`|E3tWPVEqaa	The team finishing with the most wins at the end of season|`|TLZ3GEEXaa	Currently the Lakers would have the homecourt advantage, due to having the best record in the NBA and the Lakers had swept the Celtics in the season series.|`|mbkJjQY9aa	whoever has the better record dumba$$, and if they have the same record Lakers have homecourt because WE BEAT THOSE ******* TWICE|`|o5CFB1c1aa	Today?  The Lakers!|`|39RKmCKRaa	It depends on both of their final records. Who ever has the better record gets homecourt. But the Lakers have the tie breaker because they have won the majority of their games against the Celtics this year. So if they end up having a tie record at the end of the regular season then the Lakers will have home court advantage.|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	As of right now the Lakers would they have a better win pct. and have the best record in the league.|`|jz0Mpbmdaa	the team with the better overall record at the end of the season and if it is tied the tiebreaker is the team that won more during the regular season against each other|`|182c6604bba959c84026ef7306cf79bbaa	depends on who has the higher point qoutient
cR7Sf4cjaa	H&R was purchased by the Marlin Rifle Group.  Thier guns are now manufactured as H&R 1871 Inc out of Gardner, Mass.  The old Worcester records were transfered to Gardner Mass along with the tooling.  You can call customer service and ask.    On the side of firearm you should find a set of letters - you will need to write these down before calling.  One letter will usually be the month, other letter the year.    H&R only made cheap, inexpensive firearms.  It can be really old - however it's only going to be worth what it looks like it is worth.  You are not going to discover an exotic H&R worth big  bucks.  People who could not afford a Remington, Winchester or Ithica shotgun are the ones who bought H&R's.    Hope this helps|`|FjiRPKp2aa	I think this could help.  http://www.gabelguns.com/QuestionsAndAns...|`|a268bbf5f7d7d4bbb6f43d11ccd29916aa	http://www.booktrail.com/Guns_General/DO...    Afraid this is the best I could do.  There's probably a site where H&R owners commiserate, and someone there would no doubt have access to this info, but I haven't run across such a place.  According to the Wikki . . ., the current incarnation of H & R (Marlin) is not inclined to help with anything they themselves didn't manufacture.  (since 1991)

However, in this game the officiating was so rotten and one sided that he had reason to and so the refs let it go. The refs only get pissed at that when they are calling the game evenly and the coach still gets upset.|`|Tgy7n4HLaa	He's an idiot of a coach he's the most overrated coach in the League. Remember a couple years ago before they had Allen and Garnett there record was 24*58 thats horrible.|`|0pbQg0Ohaa	He is a bad coach before we had ray and garnett he was blowing close games all the time.|`|Vx9Lvt9Aaa	I notice that every time i see him coach he has no class he is just as ruff and grimmey as the celtics...
lPDHMOVZaa	You and me both... the coverage should slow down a bit after this week... but yeah... I'm already tired of every single sports channel constantly talking about the Superbowl... I mean come on, there have been other games played since then.     I can understand if the Steelers fans aren't sick of it yet... I know I would never get sick of watching the highlights if my favorite team won... but for the sake of the rest of us... let's get it over with please.|`|lr68XuMFaa	I know how you feel but for the next week or two thats what people are going to talk about besides the Micheal Phelps Pot Pipe picture|`|sMssDP1Xaa	Not in the American Football section no.|`|GvGLHhNwaa	give it 2 more weeks|`|XkBzfEBUaa	yeah, sissy soccer fans usually get tired of talking about football less than a week after it ended    don't worry, there will be some awesome sales on purses coming in the next week or so that should keep you busy|`|cCLv7G6saa	good question more n?o entendo bulufas do que vocs est?o falando    mande um salve para o brazil?|`|13096d1166a977e58810a6cdcc148f36aa	what would you prefer, that as of midnight on the night of the game, everything just shuts down and we all start talking about basketball?  forget the game even happened?  it's been 2 days since the biggest football game of the year and you're already bored of it?  people are still talking about it cause it was a great game with some controversy and a frenzied finish.  it's why they play the sport for 5 months, to get that ONE game, and after 2 days you're bored of it?      the only thing i can suggest then is turning off the tv and internet for another week or so.  as does anything in the news, it's just a matter of time before something else comes along and makes headlines.|`|UQLNP6iyaa	No real NFL fan wants football to be over. We're like a jilted lover pining for the impending loss for 8 months, of our favorite companion. In time the wounds will heal, but for now, we just have to cling to what we have.     Of course, there is the utterly and increasingly irrelevant Pro Bowl this weekend, but I don't think I've watched it, except by accident, for about 10 years.    Cisco, you said other games have been played since the SB, oh yeah? What? Lordy, how basketball sucks. Nothing matters until the last 30 seconds. Hockey is fine if you live in the Northern states or Canada, but just seems out of place down here in Florida. At least Spring training is around the corner, so we have 150 irrelevant games for each team to watch, plus the 12 or so regular season games that matter and then the interminably long playoffs.    I can't wait for September.|`|a0751e51e77a757d57715f6706a37923aa	That's right, it's almost spring!    Time to stop talking about the Super Bowl constantly, and start talking about steroids in baseball constantly!    Of course there's also March Madness to talk about constantly, and if Brett Favre retires again we can talk about that constantly.    Is it possible for everyone to stop talking about everything constantly?  I doubt it.|`|mTSOJKlyaa	not till next superbowl

Last I checked, Dye has won a WS ring and a WS MVP trophy with them. Abreu hasn't won one yet and it's a coincedence that every team that he's played for has reached or won the World Series AFTER he left the team.|`|fJCYDSEsaa	He is still with the team. Go Sox!|`|6T90F8mNaa	Not true.    Two days ago, the White Sox had given an offer to Bobby Abreu. This would mean that Jermaine Dye would go. There were rumors about this, but all of them are untrue. Unless the highly improbable happens, Jermaine Dye will be on the South Side this year.
H3nbC71eaa	Tough one, but I'd say there's too much talent on the Hart's side. Micheal would be the weakness for the Von Erichs. David, Kerry and Kevin were all good..Stu would take out Fritz IMO. The other 4 Harts would just eventually overwhelm the Von Erichs.|`|XVYRUzkEaa	The Hart family because they have Wrestlers like Bret Hart and Owen Hart.  Yes, why Thumbs-down to Brandon?|`|41WXZPnCaa	David, Kerry, Kevin, Michael and Fritz Was Very Close More Technical      Know What    The Von Erich Make More Aports To The Wrestling Than The Harts|`|URKGZyq2aa	I would have to say Hart family as they had a little bit more techinal ability then the von erich family.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	The Hart Family...They were shooters    Edit: Why thumbs down? Do you even know what a shooter is? Its someone who can wrestle for real and doesnt play around. They can use painful holds to seriously hurt you, not like the scripted stuff
NNn84vTCaa	Yes, it'd be a great way to piss of all the WWE marks in this section.|`|0mg4OBcMaa	RoH is a niche wrestling company, servicing smarks that enjoy either boring technical wrestling (See: Danielson, Bryan or McGuiness, Nigel) or guys that dont sell anything (See: The Briscoe Brothers).  TNA is a company filled with washed up veterans at the top of the card and an undercard filled with potential.  Sounds a hell of a lot like WCW if you ask me.  The only chance they would ever have of doing anything involving overthrowing WWE would be if a bunch of WWE's top guys either left the company and got injured around the same time and came to TNA/RoH.  Or sign The Rock.  Outside of these 2 things, they have no chance of doing anything along the lines of becoming the  1 wrestling promotion in the world.  So basically what I'm saying is that there is no chance that TNA/RoH will defeat WWE.  Too much talent, too much money.|`|FgSUsJDBaa	tna and roh should work together and do payper views togther yes but they will never beat the wwe mcmahon is honestly genuis when it comes to wrestling.|`|1qBPvXJAaa	yea I think it cold work. just as long as they remain 2 different company's like the NJPW and TNA how they work together.|`|6u2YkXjlaa	even if they did they still wouldn't over rate wwe|`|1z7M3Tntaa	Oh snap lol you know how much competition that is? Jesus...don't even want to think about it lol|`|xPy6ZePkaa	ROH and TNA will never overthrow the WWE. WWE is the cream of the crop. ROH is the new up coming wrestlers come from other off brands that make it to WWE or stay in the ROH like CM Punk. Then TNA on the other hand is all the washed up wrestlers, besides Sting, that are trying to make something up of there failed attempt in the WWE, like Kurt Angle. That is just my opinion on the matter.|`|3icTrKLLaa	no. TNA would screw up the amazingness that is ROH.

OtjXWzOZaa	try this web site it might do you some good although im not sure if they have sprint work outs check though     www.runnersworld.com|`|60c1c3cd65f0c9deb7c8cdbb1a06ba1baa	Sprinting is all about being explosive. There are tons of drills and exercises to get explosive, but here are a couple to start you out.     Push ups- everyone's favorite! Except to get explosive, we're going to warp this up a bit. When you do push ups, do them in 3 different sets- one with your hands in a triangular/diamond position, one shoulder width, and one wide width. Your elbows should not go out, but tucked in. Make sure that your shoulders are above your hands, not behind it.   Now, do 10 pushups, and on the last one, hold it down position for 10 seconds. Then spring up and sprint out 50m.   When you get better at those, extend the amount of time you hold the down position or the amount of pushups you do by 5 more. As a week or so goes by and you're being consistant with this drill, turn these into clap pushups. Go down low, clap once you're up, and drop back down low again. On the 10th one, hold it down for another 10 seconds, and then get into a sprint.     Practice accelerating by learning to run with correct arms. Correct arms mean that your elbows form a 90 degrees or less, and your arm never bends out of place (no flopping your arms around). Your elbow drive should be straight back and up, coming up to about your ear. A faster, more aggresive elbow drive will result in a faster, more aggressive sprint. Make sure your elbows are tucked in, your hands and forearms turned slightly out.     Get into a weight room if you can with a trainer of some sort. If you strengthen your legs by doing lunges and cleans, you can get more power behind your run. You never want to sprint on your heels. Everything is done on your toes. You bring your knees high up, and ALWAYS keep your feet dorsiflexed (toes pointed up). When you run, drive forward with your hips. Think more about getting your hip and shin to where you want, not just reaching out with your feet. You shouldn't lean too forward or backward. Chest should be up, but your chin should be down.

Only two things will prevent him from doing so: Fitness and Form    He's been amazingly fit for someone of his age. For proof, see how hard he runs, takes diving catches and throws down the stumps in the series against India.    As for form... When he plays well, everyone loves him and when he gets out for a low score, people shake their head. At the end of the day, that his both his greatest strength and his greatest weakness.    The Problem Sri Lanka cricket has is that they are very short sighted. They hope that Sanath will keep playing and continuously bailing them out of trouble. This is too much to ask from him. Instead, they need to find some players, groom them and give them matches to gain experience. The problem with this is that no "new" player (Upul Tharanga, Mahela Udawatte etc) has cemented his place in the side.|`|NR4hbYPiaa	SL need to get rid of this loser NOW|`|zwKUfIK8aa	he will probably retire after the wc|`|561a42dcf730fd97fc3a2ebd788ea961aa	he predominantly,..should  destroy Indian teams dream in 2011 world cup ,..   until that happens he must stay  as he scored 8  ODI centuries against Indian bowling attack already...he is the dark horse to look for in NEXT World CUP  kudos sana boy>|`|ocPlxCIeaa	He will Play As long as his team needs him,  I fell he is doing a good job at present.

It is their responsibility to do something about it. They would need to call animal control or the DNR and they will probably relocate them.

I think that if there are large packs of coyotes running around on a golf course, the managment needs to kill some every chance they get. Coyotes are not dumb and they will change their habits very quickly lest their entire pack gets killed, good luck.|`|iGzpWIa0aa	good shot placement...

I carried my 1911 concealed in Boston and Portland Maine all summer long - unless you have a sub compact 1911 it is going to be uncomfortable at best.

There is certianly no shortage of useless and ill fitting holsters on the market.    Take a look at the Galco Sky-Ops holster.  This was specificially designed for the US Air Marshal Service.  I have one of these for my XD in 45acp and it lets me carry concealed without having a shirt that hangs out and makes you look like a slob.  Or have to wear a suit.  Only down side to the Sky-Ops is having to take it from one men's store to another to another trying to find a decent belt that holds it nice and tight and ain't droky looking.

z7JsVzcnaa	You can kick the ball, but if you kick the other player's crosse, you will be called for kicking the crosse.  This is a technical foul and results in possession being awarded to the other team.    That said, trying to kick a ball right when the whistle is blown on a faceoff will never ever work because the opposing player is going to clamp the ball (or some other faceoff move), so you'd just end up kicking his crosse.    Now, if you were to win a clamp or box the other player out, you could kick the ball to gain some space before looking to scoop it up.|`|amXka9LDaa	no you are not allowed to kick it. You must use ur stick until you have "possesion" what i like to do though, is before they put there head down over the ball i take my sick and put it infront of the ball like this:    o]    so that the ball is facing u and ur lax stick is farther away from u than the ball now. you must practice this it takes timing and skill
Cv7TWRhyaa	A bong with marijuana is different that a driver with alcohol.  Marijuana is an intoxicant. Its intoxicating effects are dependant on many   factors, including the potency of the drug, the dose, the duration of use, the time since last   use, the users expectation of effects, the setting of use, the route of administration, and   its consumption with other drugs, including alcohol. The impairing effects of the drug   on complex task performance such as driving are similarly subject to many factors,   making definitive statements about a subjects intoxication difficult, absent some  objective observation of its well known and distinctive effects in the individual.   There is plentiful evidence that even moderate use of marijuana has real effects on   some of the skills necessary for safe driving. The effects are most intense shortly after   smoking, and are similar to those experienced with low to moderate doses of alcohol. On   the other hand there are some marked differences between alcohol and marijuana   intoxication. The intoxicating effects following recreational marijuana use generally   dissipate within 2-3 hours following the end of smoking, whereas the impairing effects of   alcohol generally persist longer. Also, in side by side comparisons of alcohol and   marijuana intoxication, marijuana users appear to be more aware of their impairment, and   there is evidence that by force of will they can suppress the impairing effects of their   marijuana use for brief periods and perform well in non-sustained tests of performance.   They can even compensate for the effects of marijuana on their driving under controlled   conditions. This is markedly different from behavior in alcohol impaired individuals.   In this chapter we will consider the empirical properties of marijuana that have   led to its popularity as a recreational drug, and consider how these effects impact the   skills necessary for safe driving. We will examine the extent to which a relationship has   been established between marijuana use and risk of crash involvement; review how an   individuals level of intoxication can be assessed; and review studies of actual driving   performance by subjects administered marijuana.   Effects of Marijuana   As is covered elsewhere in this book, after alcohol, marijuana is the most popular   recreational drug in North America. Its effects are largely predictable in type, but not in   degree, although they do appear in a roughly dose dependant manner. The effects   discussed below make a very convincing case for the potential for marijuana to impair   driving, although as noted the extent to which that potential is realized in a given case   will be related to many other factors.  ______________________________________...  Page 2  Marijuana and Driving Impairment   2   Getting high   People variously use marijuana for its exhilarating, relaxing, hallucinogenic, anti-  nausea and soporific effects.   Marijuana is most frequently smoked, and less frequently eaten in baked goods or   drunk as an infusion. Cannabis products including marijuana, hashish and hashish oil   can be ingested orally, in tea or baked into brownies. The effect profile from oral   ingestion is much longer, taking longer for the drug to be absorbed, and for the active   THC to be distributed. The drug is likely subject to enterohepatic cycling when orally   ingested, further complicating its kinetics. Metabolite concentrations are often highly   elevated. It is not uncommon for the acute effects to last for 24 hours following oral   ingestion. Oral use is also more frequently associated with adverse effects, such as   paranoia, panic, depression and irritability. Currently available tests of blood or urine   will not allow discrimination of the route of administration.   Following smoking, marijuana effects appear within five to ten minutes. The   lower grade effects are remarkably similar to those resulting from alcohol consumption;   relaxation, social disinhibition, and talkativeness. This disinhibition leads to users   perceiving the drug effects as being mildly stimulatory at low doses. Users report the   experience as producing a general sense of well-being, which can rise to the level of   exhilaration or euphoria. It is described as a blissful state of reverie, fantasy, free-  flowing thought and clarity. The senses are heightened, with colors, smell, touch, taste,   and body perception being enhanced. Cravings for food are common. Bouts of   uncontrollable spontaneous laughter or giggling are regularly seen, with even common   events appearing to be funny or amusing.   The perceptual effects of marijuana use have an association with driving   impairment due at least in part to their distracting nature. The degree to which someone   is absorbed in their drug experience will affect their inclination to engage fully in other   demanding tasks such as driving. The degree of effect will differ from individual to   individual a|`|OYYYNCyCaa	Michael Phelps only in the USA     this is a token suspension to make out the USA Olympic Committee is doing something and not turning a blind eye like Marion Jones|`|2MfMyh4Maa	Everyone who buys illegal drugs is buying a piece of a huge criminal network that murders police and judges and reporters; bribes police and governments and jurors.  They are partly responsible for drug wars and drug related kidnappings and assaults.  They pay to make life miserable for the rest of us so that they can have their yuppie recreational drugs.      This is not true of DUI.  While very serious, DUI doesn't pay for criminal murder networks.      In my opinion, if he is guilty, he should be required to put on a DEA uniform and go into some Mexican border town where he can see close up what his money has bought.
l6g3moiEaa	As awesome as that time was in WWE (and honestly, that's the first time when I could actually watch wrestling with any kind of interest), there's no way they could go back to that. It was born of necessity, and of the spirit of competition between two wrestling promotions. There's simply no other company around that creates the need for the kind of oneupsmanship (is that a word..?) that made the Attitude Era. TNA just isn't viable enough as the spark needed to force change. And making storylines like those (say, Stone Cold vs. The Man) today would only be seen as a ripoff of what's gone before. The new D-X was nowhere near as entertaining as they were back then. I agree, though, something needs to be done, because this new and improved PG product is kind of like the recent spate of PG-13 horror (heh, remember when that was scary?): there should be no such thing.|`|6u2YkXjlaa	totally agree they need to bring it back but they won't|`|h9PVRHPWaa	yeah. might as well find yourself a time machine because thats the only way your going to get to see the attitude era.|`|bTXDb5YIaa	Yeah just wondering whos gonna lead into it|`|JcGi56qkaa	My opinion is your not a true wrestling fan who doesnt know what he is talking about.|`|wx649tsuaa	The Attitude Era won't come back anytime soon.

Gi4J3KKEaa	bring a gymbag with the following items inside:  boxer shorts, tanktop or t-shirt, extra underwear, pair of socks, 2 towels, showershoes, soap/shampoo, lock and key.  (you will need these items to change into and then shower after your workouts).    next, as far as equipment goes, you will need handwraps, punching bag gloves, and a good jump rope.  as you progress in your training and increase your stamina, get yourself a quality mouthpiece and train with it so that it feels natural when u begin sparring.     later on in your boxing training when you begin sparring, you will need to purchase some boxing shoes and a headguard that fits comfortably for you.  i've seen alot of amateurs adjusting their headgear after receiving punches then getting hit some more in the process because it didn't fit correctly or was not adjusted properly.  this way u won't have to adjust something in the middle of a match that is probably not the right size for you.    although most gyms will provide you with 16oz sparring gloves, a protective cup for your groin and a headguard for sparring, in the long run it is better if you get your own.  this way you will know what feels comfortable and right for you and not some worn out/used equipment.    arriving to a boxing gym ready to go is a good sign of your maturity and shows attention to detail and commitment.  this is the way a professional prepares himself for training and your question is a sign that you want to take this serious.     get yourself a coach/trainer and they will be able to guide you in the direction you need to go. he will inform you of  the equipment you will need in order to succeed and develop you into a future champ.    good luck.|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	honestly you need your ears and eyes and listen to everything you need to do to learn and do what they say|`|wyWGtzfAaa	Handwraps and gloves should do for now.

Normally gyms will supply gloves, mits etc.  Although you wont need a mouthguard until sparring, its a good practise to get a well fitted one early and wear it in during your workouts, especially on the bags, to help you get your breathing correct. You have to breath through your nose, not your mouth.  You may want to purchase your own gloves and mits later.  Enjoy the hardwork, comradeship and respect you will get from boxing.|`|PJmpTnlKaa	I agree with all that's been said above me. But seeing it's your first time, it's ok if you don't have all those equipment.     The one thing you will definitely need on your first day is a whole lot of enthusiasm. The rest you can buy along the way.    Have fun!
f8PWEWsOaa	Man, I am a college baseball player and there is no doubt the Louisville Flare glove is the best, but the Louisville TPX glove runs a close second. The mizuno glove will get too soft to quick. It it more important to pay the couple of extra dollars to get a better glove that will have a better pocket and last longer for you then to go the cheap route and buy a glove that isnt very good. My first year in college, they gave us the TPX flare and a Rawlings pro-preferred and I almost like the TPX glove as much as I liked the Rawlings and the Rawlings is a 400 dollar glove.

They all were great.  You really can't go wrong on any you just have to be sure that the size is right.  The length on all the gloves you are looking at are good for a infielder.  10" to 11 1/2".    You dont' have to spend two hundred to get great life out of a glove.  Spend 80 or 100 and then spend 10 on oil.  Oil it often, even after you break it in.  It's like polishing dress shoes, helps pretect them from diamond dust and water.

If a team who's finishes 5th in the league and has won the F.A cup will leave a place for some one who's 6th in the table or the F.A cup runners up.    The other route is the intertotocup which is another structure set up for U.E.F.A Qualification round.    The League Cup winner is as they called it, " the back door" to the U.E.F.A cup First Round which is a further stage from qualification.

fvMv1DT3aa	Absolutely. So many great wwe legends have held those titles and now they are barely even being recognized anymore.The wwe does not create any good feuds that revolve around those titles like they used to and now they seem to be much less important. They are extremely prestigious titles and any wrestler would be lucky to be carrying either of them. But, the wwe is much more focused on the World Heavyweight Championship and the WWE Championship to even create a decent storyline revolving around the US championship and the IC championship. In my opinion, instead of making every wrestler a main eventer, they should have a good amount of wrestlers going after the mid carder belts. CM Punk, Rey Mysterio, JBL, Matt and Jeff Hardy, MVP, Kofi Kingston, Finlay, and so many others could put on some great matches revolving around these titles.|`|XkBzfEBUaa	with such greats as:  Chavo Guerrero, Matt Hardy, Jeff Hardy, CM Punk, Mark Henry, and such such classic HOF superstars winning the World Heavyweight title,  it has severely diminished the U.S. and IC belts, seeing as just anyone can in the Heavyweight....i guess any blind, deaf, cripple can win the IC belt (see Willaim Regal for example)|`|sMTNLNF6aa	they gave santino the ic belt, that brought it completely down, he's not a wreslter, he's a comedian|`|2FKHNIB2aa	I wouldn't say they lost prestige but the races for them have died down because WWE chooses to focus more on nontitle and major championship feuds.|`|bGAv6Gjpaa	yes!|`|8Im1iGFTaa	ya they are hardly fueded for or even defended anymore  i mean look Regal was champ....come on|`|dGYR81enaa	Definately the IC title used to actually mean something but now they have Santino winning it and it is never defended at main events but they did attempt to reinstate its status when they had that tournament back in November but thats it really!|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	That's what attitude did to most of the titles! short reigns and a fast turn over mean that all the titles were devalued to an extent. Point in case everyone complains at a title reign over 4 months but that would have been considered a short reign 15 years+ ago! the WWE seem to be more interested in the world title and everything else is just there to look nice around someones waist. TNA has gone the same way with the X Division... So blame Russo!    Side Note... People have been bashing William Regal! Regal is one of the best technical wrestlers on the roster and can wrestle rings around just about anyone on the roster! Talent Truly is lost on the new generation of fans!

p4H61jQDaa	spain should win this game as they are better in every position, goalkeeper they are ahead by a mile as casillas is back to super human form with madrid.  Defense is more even as spain have puyol and capdivilla as their superstars while england have a solid CB partnership with rio ferdanand and jamiie carragar.  The spain mid is vastly superior with xavi, cesc, xabi and senna along with david silva and ineista all as good as any english mid.  strikers are vastly superior as they have arguably the best striker in la liga and the best striker in the PL in villa and torres along with guiza.  The only way england can win this game is if capello structures england to tactically beat you but i doubt it.  GO SPAIN BABY
SUzwdaq4aa	very carefully with nails    I think|`|lTeXIjpOaa	you dont have to heat shoes to shape them; first you must pull off the old shoes by clipping the heads of the nails off; you next trim the hoof with nippers, pare out the inside a little with a hoof knife and trim the frog if needed; next rasp the trimmed hoof to get rid of any edges and to make things even; shape the shoe to fit the hoof with a hammer and anvil; tack on the shoe with about six nails, clip off the excess nail, and clinch the end of the nail; rasp the end of the nail so there is not a sharp surface and around the bottom of the hoof where it meets the shoe for evenness|`|tkqGwbtHaa	a farrier nails it on. watch this video, it shows the farrier remove the old and add the new. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqUFoKwOY...|`|5UC4h886aa	The farrier usually does it, but many horse people can do it by themselves. Usually, you have to take off the old shoe first with a sort of clamp. Then you chip away at the bottom of the hoof (don't touch the triangular strip in the middle-that's full of nerves and horses can't stand it being hurt)   until it's all even and you hold different shapes and szes of shoes to it to see which is the best fit. Then you need to make this fitting shoes very hot so you can shape it. then you put it on the hoof (after it's cooled a bit) and fix it with nails that come out like spikes out of the hoof. You have to bend these down so they lie against the hoof and sometimes they need a little clipping as well. Every hoof size has to be done separately because every hoof is different.

AA11105507	It's because HHH has a lot of political power backstage.  He has a hand in dictating feuds, storylines, and the title picture, and of course, puts himself in the main event spotlight more often than not.  He buries other wrestlers that he feels threatens his spot as top dog.  That's why Kurt Angle and Booker T left for TNA.      On the other hand, the Undertaker is one of the most respected people backstage because of his leadership among the wrestlers.

05xB3cPkaa	Manny may not take any Dodger offers, but rather may pull a Roger Clemens, i.e. sit out the start of the season and wait for the market to come to him.    A fair offer would be two years with a club option for a third, which would make sense if the bidders were American League teams. That would allow Manny to DH in a year or two. However, no AL teams have come forward, let alone another National League team. Until that happens, there's no incentive for LA to up the ante.|`|VwccuEFHaa	the dodgers want him back, but they arent going to throw away any more money for someone who could easily flop.  Instead, they could take that money and possibly get 3 or 4 top knotch players, including the starter of the 2008 allstar game (Ben Sheets).  They lost some pitching after their 2008 season, so bringing back manny wont solve their problems.|`|y2DZIDRaaa	Manny wants a multi-year contract.

eaYtGz9gaa	How about exploring camping without your Mom and sister since they don't seem interested in that type of activity.  I have mentored 14-18 year old boys and girls through the Boy Scouts Venture Crew.  This is like scouting on steroids.  We taught the youth rock climbing, rappelling, white water canoeing , backpacking, orienteering and so much more.  This is REAL camping.  Venture Crews are available all over the country.  I have listed one website below.  Contact them and find out about venturing.  If this particular crew isn't near your home, contact your local Boy Scouts of America (in the phone book) and find out where the closest one to you is.  Be prepared to learn a lot about yourself and the outdoors.  Have a great time!|`|NrSs1lJgaa	thats women for you i dont know if you can convince women anything  when you figure out how to do that let me know|`|GkqTIGVqaa	That might be kinda hard to convince them soo maybe ask a friend to camping with them|`|wxEqpMrEaa	Your old enough to handle yourself. Actually when I was 15 I moved away from home, and was on my own. I DON'T suggest this, but I learned a lot of things. Ok, go camping without them. Try getting some more independence with a vacation of your own. I understand that at the ripe old age of 14 you can handle anything, but let's stay safe, you see, a camping expedition in Yosemite with just you and two females is NOT a good idea with the predators getting braver here lately, and depending on how long the vacation is, I'm guessing a week at least since your family travels, they won't hear of it I'm sure, but they might go for RVing. You see you can rent an RV and although it's not what your calling real camping it will put you in the edge of the woods (which is much closer than what they are thinking) Or better yet, there are camps that rent cabins, and sometimes you can get a weekly rate, which will solve the money issue. Do your homework and search for approved campsites. Maybe after they experience it, they will want to do it more.
AA11528760	Vince Mcmahon brought back ECW under Extreme Championship Wrestling, and even though it doesn't go any where near that title, WWE's ECW isn't meant to be "Extreme." I believe that Vince simply brought ECW back, under Extreme Championship Wrestling, as a marketing campaign for the new brand. Vince is a business man, and as a business man, wouldn't you want your product to succeed?    This ECW isn't meant to cherish the older days of the original ECW, it is pretty much a development show that got a TV deal with Sci-Fi. It is meant to be a building block for future wrestlers and to help shape out their careers within the WWE. It's not to go to the "extreme" like the name wants us to think. The ECW title is like the FCW Heavyweight Title. You will never see Shawn Michaels or The Undertaker as the FCW champion, and that is for one reason, it's for upcoming stars. This ECW is meant to give wrestlers on the lower card a chance to shine, a chance to prove to the WWE that they can move up the ranks.|`|3icTrKLLaa	Nobody wants to see New Jack in a ring again. He is going to kill somebody literally.|`|b8568740e59872f29e957e1ca020af9caa	Where's the ~EXTREME~ in ECW ???

Heyman made ECW into a great company, but he never really cared about it, it was just a promotion to me. He never fought to keep it afloat, he never tried to stop people from going to the WWE or WCW, he doesn't even have a problem with the way Vince is running ECW nowadays. Due to Heyman's lack of care for ECW he abandoned it as it was dying and jumped to the WWE to be a commentator. In the end, Heyman killed ECW, not Vince or TNN or WCW or censorship groups or the extreme rules matches or any of that stuff.|`|XSDVNJeAaa	I agree with you|`|l6g3moiEaa	You actually answered your own question. Vince McMahon bought the company and its rights, and that was the end of ECW. It really shouldn't have been, because if Vince were truly the visionary people make him out to be, he would have made ECW become the very competition that WWE needs, instead of pulling its assets into the WWE. He still has a chance to do just that, say if he were to buy TNA. Keep the show the same, don't try to saturate them with WWE talent, and start some genuine WCW vs ECW vs WWE fires going. That right there would be a stroke of the kind of genius Vince hasn't had in years. He should never have snuffed out his own competition when he could have profitted more from controlling both.|`|e6TcpDcxaa	i totally agree ECW stands for EXTREME championship wrestling  not dumbshit promotion why do they bother calling it ecw if it is not even extreme no sabu no rvd no sandman they have ruined dreamer big time its just a bag of ****
xOReEw6Waa	God NO, do not buy the 710 Remington for any reason. The 710 is an attempt by Remington to enter the Box Store Market and it is a dismal failure as a gun. The bolt and trigger can only be described as painful to use. If anything ever happens to the barrel or action there is absolutely ZERO you can do to fix them--you can only throw them away--really bad way to waste money.  For only a few dollars more than the 710 you can get a very viable Stevens/Savage or Howa 1500 / Weatherby Vanguard. I was really tempted to buy a Stainless / Laminate Howa in 270 WSM for $400 at a major store. The Mossberg ATR is leaps and bounds above the 710, but the Howa or Savage outclasses the Mossberg by the same margin.  I have multiple Browning A-Bolts and I think that gives me a good reference point for comparing guns. I actually prefer the Tikka T3s, but I still might have to get that Howa.   The M-44 isn't so bad, but why handicap yourself with 1890s technologies.I hunt in Idaho and I will get shots from 25 feet to 300+ yards. I want to make sure I can make the 300 yard shot because I know the 100 is a chip shot compared to it. It is always great to check out new guns, and I have because I've been looking for an upgrade rifle for my son's 243 single shot. I was holding 7 different rifles today.   Buy the best quality you can afford, you will never kick yourself for it, but you will never forgive yourself for buy something cheap.|`|EqSvWjwPaa	well i wouldnt have a 30 06 to just shoot around with i would get a ruger mini 14 or a marlin 22 semi auto 14 rounds|`|YrxLbfiIaa	The Remington 710 is not one of Remington's better idea's.... Pass on that one.... The M44 rifle is generally inexpensive and the ammunition is cheap -- But I would not call it a "fun" shooter or just a rifle for "plinking....... Although the recoil isn't monstrous it just stout enough where me and my pals that own these usually fire about 20 - 25 rounds in an afternoon and that's enough of that.....    If you want to do some informal shooting on the cheap then surely consider an SKS rifle.... The ammo it uses is 7.62X39MM and its cheap........ The recoil isn't objectionable at all...    http://www.samcoglobal.com/sks.html    http://www.the-armory.com/shopsite_sc/st...|`|AA10552262	The M44/7.62 is inexpensive, as is the ammo. Good choice. The M98 Mauser in 7x57 or 8x57 is my first choice. Nothing fancy...but lots of fun.|`|a268bbf5f7d7d4bbb6f43d11ccd29916aa	When you say, 'fun to shoot,' I get the impression you're not looking for a hunting rifle.  These two rifles shoot cartridges that are nearly ballistic twins.  Either one would make a good deer cartridge.  There are a LOT more options for the '06 when you go to buy ammo in the USA.  '06 ammo can be reloaded and the components are common.  The M-44 IS an old Russian bolt action.  I have it's older brother (M91-30) that's longer and chambers the same cartridge.  It's sturdy and kicks like an '06.  I wouldn't hesitate to take to the field with it if I could see well enough to use it's iron sights.  I enjoy shooting it from the bench as is, but after 40 rounds or so, I'm ready to move to something lighter.  The Russian cases cannot be reloaded as I recall.  If I hadn't shot mine all up I'd go check, but I believe they use the Berdan primer.  They use an odd-looking rimed case--not that that matters much.  You'd be limited to a few bullet weights in soft point, and fmj, but you shouldn't have to look far to find it.   As far as the 710 goes, I've seen Remington do some inovative things and they proved the point with the Nylon 66.  I guess their name on it is good enough for me.  Between the two, the Mosin-Nagant is more interesting for it's history to me.  I'd probably remove the bayonet, though, since I don't shoot prone.  If I was just plinking, I'd probably pick up my .30 carbine.  It IS fun to shoot, but not accurate enough to hold my interest at the bench.  I assume the same would hold for the SKS.  That's enough.
OtjXWzOZaa	long runs are a great to help wit the longer distances and the times arent that bad. keep working at it you will get better as time goes on you have more room for improvement than the long time runners that dont have as big of room for improvement|`|8NgG0WSlaa	First off, don't worry to much with the training everything will come. It won't happen all at once but if you keep working, you're times will gradually improve as your body adapts to the workouts. I myself run track and am a freshman but in college. What i've gotten so far is don't do to much on your own, don't get me wrong its good, but your coaches have a certain workout for you and sometimes is hard and doing more will burn you out. The best thing to do is eat healthy, and get alot of sleep... middle distance runners need it trust me! lol  Second thing is setting goals that are reasonable, to keep ya motivated and 10-20 seconds is possible as long as you stay healthy eat right, and get plenty of sleep. P.S. you'r'e still growing so your body is gonna mature into the runner you want to be. All is possible when you believe. Best of luck to ya and let me know how it goes for ya. Fanatic
b819b870c70c7d8b59b6b8a1323815e3aa	Clearly, if you're tapering, you have a major meet in the very near future.      Here is some information regarding tapering:  Tapering does not decrease your need for sleep, tapering allows your body to thoroughly recover from the stress you placed on it from regular intense training.  Tapering makes it so you do not fatigue as easily, it does not increase your energy level.  Tapering increases your body's ability to manage waste products from exercise and access nutritional substances in your muscles so as to increase the time you can exercise with intensity.    All of that said, I'd suggest that you're sleeplessness is due to anxiety (nervousness) about the big meet.  That happens frequently to swimmers as it all comes down to a day or two when you hope you'll swim your best.    So, what I have my swimmers do is to practice their races in their minds.  I plan their races out for them and they know exactly how fast they should be going at each part of the race ... they know where they must work to keep their stroke long and smooth ... where they should be speeding up, how to do their turns and finishes.      I'd also suggest that you ask your coach about relaxation techniques.  Maybe read a book but, don't spill any warm milk on the book.    Good luck at the big meet!|`|0wwt5oJMaa	You get tappered each week???  im in the same boat as you but i get tired then my brain wont shut down. i actually read before bed in a dim light it may work sometimes... have relaxing music like gental giants of the sea or rainforest sor music. but if your being taped you should save all this enery for the meet or go on a sugar high then try to go to bed after it has ended so your tired.    good luck though|`|jIyvb2OOaa	i personally listen to my ipod.... only relaxing songs. but idk if thatll help you. im sorry i cant help you anymore my tapers never ruined my sleeping. oh and also your not supposed to use the computer before going to sleep.. something about the lights. i guess im a hypocrite though
iw3v5bgIaa	If you're looking for goalie pad sizing, a general rule is measure from the center of your knee (with a flexible tape measure) to the center of you inside ankle bone and double the measurement to get you in the ball park.     It's important to get your knee in the cradle, especially in the down (butterfly/profly) position.    You can also checkout Vaughn's sizing at:  http://www.vaughnhockey.com/sizing/sizin...    Now keep in mind that different manufacturers size a little different, so it's best to go to a local pro shop and try different pads with your skates and pants on, to make sure everything fits you well all together.    If you find a good deal, go for it.    You can also check out this site:  http://www.squidoo.com/sports-hockey-equ...    Wherever you go, go informed!!!|`|axxQzOCHaa	depends on your skate size + if you play more of a butterfly, stand-up or hybrid style.

It counts. It is not a turnover if a player is dribbling, throws the ball against the backboard, jumps up and grabs it, and dunks it.     A player can also be dribbling, bounce the ball high off of the floor so that it goes near the rim, jump up and grab it, and dunk it. It would count as a self-bounce pass dunk.    A player could be dribbling the ball, bounce it off of an opposing players head so that it goes near the rim, jump up and grab it, and dunk it.|`|o2Otpdllaa	it counts as 2 points plus a rebound

xOReEw6Waa	Your 22-250 is an amazing cartridge, and is that or 223 for varmint shooting for the majority of people. The 17 Fireball is pretty much a necked down 223. You would actually be trading down performance going from the 22-250 to 17 Fireball. The Fireball would be great if you were just getting into shooting because of the low recoil and the great performance it has--so yes the 17 Rem is a good cartridge. I would hang on to your M77 though.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	No you already have the best rifle and caliber in the 22-250, however if you want to upgrade, and gain better performance, range, and accuracy then buy a 243 caliber in a Remington or Savage Brand Rifle.* Then you will have a Varmint, Tactical, Hunting, and long range Target Rifle that will deliver from 0 to 1,000 yards.*|`|53Pgx7TJaa	I'd say you are going to be able to reach out and touch something a little better with your 22-250.  I don't own a 17 RF but I do own a 22-250 and I wouldn't trade it for the world.  I also own a 204 ruger and it is extremely accurate.  I shot a turkey in WV this past fall season with my 204 ruger at 350 yds!!  Amazing little cartridge, so much so that my friend who witnessed the shot is convinced the 204 is his next varmint rig.  Just thought I'd add my 2 cents!  Good luck and be safe.|`|1jmXT4Vvaa	The 17 Fireball is the perfect answer to the question that no one was asking.  They are pleasant to shoot, quiet, low recoil, and accurate.  That being said, we all ready have a half dozen cartridges to choose from that fall into that category.  I would hesitate if only because of the limited ammo supply.  Other calibers I would consider 204 Ruger, 222, 223, 22-250, 17 Rem.  It seems like this end of the market is flooded with good choices, Remington just threw another one at us.  I really doubt if it will take off like the 204 has.  It will be around for a few years, then gun makers will cut the chambering from there offerings.  Five years later, Remington will cut the ammo from their lineup.  Then the cost of ammo will skyrocket and you'd better hope you reload.  I'm not even sure if the brass can be formed from another caliber, I'd assume it could, but I've never heard of it being done.  If I were you, I'd opt for the 204 or a 223.  The 17 Fireball would be excellent on coyotes, especially if you're after the pelts.  I just think there are more logical choices.|`|6en8QlaUaa	No, not for the hunting you do.|`|05f0ed7a9964bfcd8e3e5fe172f1cf21aa	17 caliber rifles tend to foul barrels very quickly , often requiring cleaning after only 15 rounds.  even finding cleaning rods for them is a chore sometimes.  it is not a performance issue other than wind deflection but merely one of shooting practicality  you already have a fantastic coyote chambering in the 22-250   i do not think you would be so pleased with the caliber as you must be with the 22-250
Y3KMLdjWaa	Depends on where you live and how much access you have to pools, rivers, lakes, etc. in these cases swimming with out a doubt.

sTKfeJAeaa	lakers aren't really a one man show anymore, they have a deep bench. Kobe doesn't even shoot as much as he used to, he's been racking up the assists by dishing to the paint for bynum or gasol. I think they're both great teams with very talented ballplayers. Their games are so good to watch, especially when the lakers win ; ) I'm a laker fan born and raised, but honestly I'm glad LA is playing as hard as they are, after losing in the finals last season, they have a chip on their shoulder and are looking for redemption.     To officially answer the question, the lakers are just a bit better than the celtics. With the help of bynum i think they're gonna go all the way, as long as they play smart and stay healthy the road to the finals looks clear.    P.S.

I agree that Deron should be in the All Star game but his injury hurt his stock.  Now that CP has a groin injury, he may need an All Star replacement.... maybe D.W., but it would probably be either Al Jefferson or Kevin Durant because it doesn't have to be a PG.|`|scAstIpwaa	Yeah that was awesome - too bad he missed the shot, or it could have made it to a lot of highlight reels.

r5AMG8g7aa	I studied for as short time with Larry Hartsell back in 1975. Hartsell was one of the original student under Bruce Lee and was in a group picture in the "Bruce Lee Memorial Book".  We had many talks about JKD.  It was a philosophy. not an art. Lee intended it to be a guide rather than a strict set of techniques or mind set. Much of what he intended it to be has been mis-interpreted. He did not want it to end up a bunch of schools claiming to teach JKD.  People have taken his "Take what is useful", statement to mean that they should go around studying a little here and there and putting together "What they think works". Even after creating JKD, Lee continued to practice Wing Chun. He understood the importance of being very grounded in martial arts that are practical and have worked well for many generations. His understanding was not what people today are doing. Everyone now is trying to re-invent the wheel. There is nothing wrong with the wheel. People need to see that and stick with an art until they master it before moving on to other things.   In the last 41 years I have met countless people that jump around from art to art in an attempt to create their own style or idea of JKD.  Several I've met have been doing this for 10-20 or more years. When it gets down to it all they really have done is to put a bunch of unrelated moves together. They think that they have accomplished much because they can spar full contact. Yet when they get their tails kicked by someone that has a strong background in a traditional art, they move on to continue to look for the Holy Grail. It is sad that they learn so much of the surface of many arts, only to mis the true nature of traditional martial arts, due to them mis-understanding what Bruce Lee was trying to teach.|`|616f37abb5f6bb497fbb33bae765a7e2aa	I've done both JKD and JKDC. JKDC is several styles of martial arts that use the philosophies of Bruce Lee to put them all together. JKD itself is what Bruce actually taught. But you find several different styles of JKD out there because of how Bruce was always developing. Thats why if you see people like Jerry Poteet practicing JKD, it'll look more like Wing Chun because he was training with Bruce at that stage in his life. As to where if you see Ted Wong practicing you would see JKD at its last development before Bruce died. You would see the footwork, the trapping, the non telegraph punch. The whole JKD and JKDC controversy is one big political mess worse then Republicans and Democrats.|`|tZXHSxkQaa	All anyone can learn any of is JKDC(Jeet Kune-Do concepts).Dan Inosanto wrote a book,Absorb what is useful,disregard what is not.I am looking for a copy of that book myself.|`|cFMFNVj8aa	This is a hard question to answer.... but here I go, in jkd often they teach you a few basics like straight punches, low kicks and whatever the teacher has found to be "effective" in no rules no padding all out fighting situations and some physics and body mechanics. Also they get you to train with the other fighters at the school (many of them have experience in other systems) and learn moves from them and apply them in a vale tudo like fight to see what works and what dosn't to see what you should keep using and what you should discard. After that you will be encouraged to learn other styles of martial arts and apply the techniques accordingly.|`|NJMzhcKhaa	JKD is not a martial art, JKD is a martial art philosophy, in essence, there is no JKD martial art, there is JKD Concept.  Most JKD stuff is actually Dan Inosanto's filipino stuffs.    Bruce Lee's art is actually called Jun Fan Gung Fu. The actual JKD as philosophy is from his training in Fencing and his talk to Dan Inosanto.    JKD as a philosophy is decent and very sound, JKD as a martial art is based more on exploiting Bruce Lee's name.

E3wAsSjUaa	The Indianapolis Offense is predominately a passing attack team. I don't think Mr. LT would be too happy about getting a lot less carries.  LT will stay with S.D. At least for the upcoming season.|`|UwVf7Cpaaa	no manning is best with a more scat back type. LT would finish his career best by staying a charger but if not there then somewhere like tampa or houston would be a best fit for him|`|Nzk70xVwaa	Are you kidding? We don't have the cap room for that since we're already begging Haynesworth to come in|`|d3NFDruTaa	How about this the San Diego Chargers! HE IS NOT GOING ANY WHERE!!!|`|KjG27GUlaa	LT and Sproles need to stay with the Chargers!!!  People are pissing me off with this whole "OMG Sproles won the game for us, forget about LT"   frankly, it's  $%@  LT has seen the Chargers through so much.  Sproles saved one game with a touchdown and now he's all amazing and the best player on the Chargers.  BULL!!!  He never could have saved the game had he not lost one of the previous TDs  and peyton manning gets on my nerves too!!  his commercials are stupid   I'm not hatin'  I'm just statin'|`|KR3IvxNwaa	no because Manning choose too many passing play. they need a running back who has good catching ability maybe like Steven Jackson.    edit : i know LT can catch as well but i think Jackson is a better catcher.|`|eIOlBzm8aa	Why so he can lose to the Chargers with Peyton Manning? Patriots if he wants a title or stay with the Chargers. Only 2 viable options if he wants a title.|`|xxtvhn5Naa	He will stay w/ the Chargers till he retires.|`|AA10315681	No!.....I actually think that a better QB/RB duo would be with T.Brady&LT because I think that Brady has the better mind as a QB than Gay-*** Peyton Manning because I think that Tom Brady can/could/would be able to spread the ball out to many more players than just one and PLUS he's just got a/such a cooler sense of being when it comes to playing the QB position.|`|TJMpKqFNaa	Maybe, but that duo wouldn't be enough to push the Colts over the top if you ask me.    I don't think LT at age 30 would be a big enough upgrade by himself to turn the Colts into an instant lock for the Super Bowl or anything like that.  It wasn't the Colts' running game that killed them this year in the playoffs (and earlier in the year) anyway, it was more their defense that let them down from what I saw.    LT should stay in San Diego.  If I were Norv Turner, I'd forget about using LT much in the first half of the season and keep him fresh for the 2nd half of the year and the playoffs (kind of like how Arizona used James this year).  I think the playoffs would have looked a lot different the last 2 years had San Diego had a reasonably healthy LT available in the backfield for either of them.
1Z0Lmrk1aa	Agree. When Boston started getting chippy I was like, mmmm, what is this all about.

fKfd4Tp1aa	When you come into WWE, Vince waters down everybody's moves I think since if every wrestler wrestled to their full potential, it would make for confusing matches since you wouldn't be able to learn the name of the wrestler's moves so easily. Vince does this to Cena especially since he doesn't wan't Cena to become injured or ratings and income for the company will go down. Cena CAN wrestle!! Just look at his OVW matches, WWE debut matches and WWE matches when he was heel. Vince wants Cena fans to easily learn the name of his moves, Cena has 12 moves right now altogether, but Vince makes him only use about 7 nearly every match to keep him safe and let his fans easily learn his moves.|`|WQGvE60waa	Im going to be Honest.    Cena has less moves than 20.      Its like every move he has is a "super power".    It kinda sucks to see someone with a limited move set be on Top.    I know he devotes time to Charities and children, but this is Wrestling not the Peace Corps.    (No Offense to anybody, but its true)      He has the Fans and Wrestlers respect, but he Can't wrestle      If he wasn't admired by Vince he would be a mid-carder fighting for the IC Title, or held back like Kane is    I saw more moves out of Yokzuna than Cena|`|JiCfYfLraa	john cena is overrated plain and simple.|`|bTXDb5YIaa	what the hell type of match are you in that you have to use 100 moves to beat some dude up can't stay basic and sell the move so you don't get beat up so bad|`|GMSTaRgyaa	I don't know why people love cena at all, is it because he's been in movies?? Persionally i could name tons of wrestlers which are way better than him.|`|NZKramllaa	I agree, It doesn't really matter at this point, all Wrestler in WWE has limited move-sets. Once your the face of WWE of course your going to be held back from doing certain moves to prevent Injuries. Once your Injured Money goes down for the company, Cena CAN Wrestle, If you say he can't you sure didn't do your research on him, Check out his OVW and UPW days and then judge him.|`|31VWMjTIaa	I don't really know! your rite y do people do dat?|`|An9g13w1aa	People complained because in his matches they followed an always repetitive format where he'd get beaten down by the monster heel, fight back all of a sudden, hit five key moves (Throwback, Killswitch, Five Knuckle Shuffle, Release Fisherman's Suplex) and then hit the FU or lock in the STFU. The thing is matches need to have variety, no opne wants to see twenty minutes of two guys hitting the five same moves. Knowing more moves allows for more complex match psychology where you don't know what your opponent will tyr next and you need to be unpredictable and how are you supposed to do that with only five moves?|`|eDNH4Ihgaa	Hello wrestling user.

Costello: Look Abbott, if you're the coach, you must know all the players.    Abbott: I certainly do.    Costello: Well you know I've never met the guys. So you'll have to tell me their names, and then I'll know who's playing on the team.    Abbott: Oh, I'll tell you their names, but you know it seems to me they give these ball players now-a-days very peculiar names.    Costello: You mean funny names?

PXpeP7j1aa	The smith and wesson will have the advantage in most situations. It has the multiple shot capability and in similar barrel lenghts that would really be the only difference. If you do go for the contender I would buy the .357 maximum. It is really an awesome round. It duplicates the performance of a .44 magnum with a smaller faster more accurate bullet that will reach out farther than most. It is only chambered in singleshots because of it's high pressure. I hope this helps.|`|OYy1OmDPaa	Contender would be better.  More velocity and accuracy.    The multiple shot theorists have never been hunting.|`|K5AeQuSNaa	Neither.  It is not a good deer hunting round in a pistol. You would get more velocity with the contender, but only one shot.  If you are considering a contender, and deer are in your future, get a barrel that is chambered in a better cartridge  There are a ton of rounds out there designed for hunting deer with that platform.  I would consider 7TCU or similar cartridges to be the minimum for hunting deer sized game with a single shot pistol.    For anything other than hunting and target shooting at a distance, a good revolver beats a single shot pistol every time.  If you want to carry it concealed, go with a 2 1/2 inch barrel.  For general tasks, a 4 inch barrel.  For target shooting and plinking varmints, a 6 inch barrel.  For deer, get a different gun.|`|3b8557f01cef58611c2e78e57d57b1e5aa	Get the Smith & Wesson in a 6 inch barrel, it is more than capable of Harvesting your Deer within 50 yards.* Use 158 grain jacketed hollow points for hunting.* Use 125 grain jacketed hollow points for self-defense ammo.* It is the most versatile best choice.*|`|53Pgx7TJaa	I don't think the 357 magmun would be my first (or my second) choice for deer.  But if you gave me a choice between a s&w (assuming a revolver) and a single shot T/C contender (assuming a 10" barrel), I'd go with the contender only because of its accuracy.  You're going to need perfect shot placement with a 357!!
yZjOFSd8aa	I would...i just love the sport and my team!    Born in North Carolina, UNC Grad, Tarheel Fan!  True Blue|`|b38a792bf2cb6a7cf64e2b3989db936eaa	Yes I would.      Lakers fan for life.|`|c68b31739ffbee17f6dfc635bbe9ffddaa	The team. You root for your team. Historically players move on and play for other teams.|`|XpQGWMFfaa	It matters, if you just like the team only for that one person, root for another team. If you sort of like both, root for both. (but if you go watch with your friend, go with or against him or her)
vA7Iq6FSaa	Definitely the Wake Forest v. Georgia Tech game.  It got very little hype going into it, because Wake Forest is so good and GT is well, not, but it was a very exciting game.  Tied at 72 with several seconds left, Wake Forest inbounded it, but the guy couldn't catch the pass, and it went straight out of bounds.  Georgie Tech came back, and their point guard broke down Jeff Teague to pull up for the game winning shot.|`|qUsi4dACaa	I gotta go with UConn and Villanova.  That was an awesome game!  Also, UNC and Miami......last second game.|`|4yiH5TiQaa	When Wake beat UNC!|`|u1fK5CuNaa	When Michigan beat Duke and when they beat UCLA in the SAME season.

9DtJeAUKaa	No.   He shouldn't even be suspended, it's no one's business, really. Doesn't matter who was in the picture...     1. They don't have the marijuana.   2. They don't have a positive drug test.   3. They don't have the bong.   4. Even if they had the bong, they couldn't prove what was in it at the time of the incident.   5. Without him admitting specifically it was marijuana, they have absolutely nothing.   6. It was just a PICTURE!   7. The sheriff is just a publicity hound looking to make a name for himself.    He should be left alone!     Marijuana should be legal anyway. Alcohol is & it's worse.|`|WFZWlGA0aa	I would not like to see that...but I almost feel that it would be the ethical thing for him to do. : / America has much higher standards for athletes.|`|DGXE4VH0aa	nope....over half of athletes smoke pot.|`|iJxGAaASaa	what?  heck no.  he earned those medals.  did you watch him?  he smoked pot afterwards, which was stupid of him...    ... not to do it more privately.  geez.|`|D8sMuoCpaa	No, under no circumstances. He smoked pot after he won the medals.  If he won all of those events after smoking pot then he should get more medals because pot is a performance zapper.    Now lets talk about Lance Armstrong.|`|iTTS06IKaa	I don't think it should go that far...yes, he screwed up by doing drugs, but everyone makes mistakes. In your teenage years you must have done SOMETHING you're not proud of, maybe you even experimented in drugs too. It's not excusable, but he earned those 8 medals, and he's already in hot water as it is. He was suspended from participating in swimming races for 3 months, and he will have to live with the shame of being a bad role model. I think he's getting punished, and won't ever do something like that again.|`|UHX0jZ8gaa	no  he shouldnt  he earned those before he started smoking  so he should keep them|`|bTXDb5YIaa	take those medals back he should had been happy to get those medals now he just did that|`|rGGymoowaa	No as you don't understand that winning the medals is an accomplishment in the pool not what went on outside. Also you may not like people who smoke marijuana , but it has no zip zero performance enhancing abilities. There's no bases even for such a proposal.     Besides those medals are not Phelps to give away they where awarded by the IOC for winning 8 times in the pool and have no relevance to what he did outside.     Should pro athletes have to give back their championship rings for the legal problems they get into as some of them have even shot people?     Should sport teams forfeit their championships do to players that used steroids when they won?      There was a case back in the 1998  in which a Snowboarder from Canada Ross Regbagliati tested positive for marijuana and was stripped of his medal. He appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sports and they ruled in his favor and returned his gold medal.     REASON: Marijuana is not a performance enhancing drug and thus played no role in his winning a gold medal or gave him an unfair advantage over his opponents.     That was during the competition , so Phelps case is even more irrelevant in regards to his medals.|`|agR89OPtaa	Only if the Olympic Committee tells him to.  He is in so much trouble, I don't see him getting out of it for a long time.  Now the cops are talking about pressing charges.  That is too bad, a young man like that screwing up his life so bad.|`|z7JsVzcnaa	Of course not.  He was tested at the Olympics and passed all of those drug tests.  This happened after the fact.  And when it comes down to it, the punishment he got was quite light, and rightly so.  US swimming doesn't want to severely punish Phelps for smoking pot.  Their sole intention was to let him know that he needs to be a little bit smarter about what he does because everyone is watching.|`|ZqAufNvmaa	no..  who cares  he still is a kicka** swimmer!|`|kLPaq30Eaa	No. He wasn't doing drugs while he competed at the Olympics. They test for that.|`|iRQMldYxaa	No way man. It's not that big a deal...
Y3KMLdjWaa	If this is a local bike race just contact the promoter and they will be more than happy to give you tons of info. As far as how to put the article together check out some of the stories at the links the other posters have supplied.    Note: Make sure you mention the promoters and sponsors as they never get enough credit for the long hours to put together an event.|`|hlhDJpLKaa	http://www.velonews.com/|`|97617c2ef9d646e082ac6afdd45ebbc1aa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tour_de_Fra...    http://www.usacycling.org/    http://www.bikeride.com/|`|1jPiAkP4aa	Well, depending on where you live, you may be out of luck to report on it for _this_ weekend. There isn't anything going on in north america. In europe, it's cyclocross season. The only 'big' race right now is the Tour of Quatar (http://www.cyclingnews.org/road.php?id=r...     On februaury 14th the Tour of California will start, but that's too late for you.    In Austrailia there are alot of races going on. Here is a good place to start:    www.cyclingnews.org    They're based in austrailia, so there's good coverage from them right now.     As far as learning about racing, it's hard to give you a local resource without knowing where you live. The USA cycling website has a decent information source (http://www.usacycling.org/encyclingpedia... to get you started. If you're in the US, they can also lead you to racing clubs in your area.|`|AA11159828	If you are writing on a specific(Local) race, Go to the race and talk to the Racing officials(if their not to busy )  If you are talking about a Major race(like a UCI Pro tour Race) i would suggest looking at the Races' webpage(many have them, like Letour.fr for the Tour de france)  cycling websites. www.velonews.com is OK but www.cyclingnews.com is better.  Go to the library and get a couple of Cycling handbooks to learn the terminology and tactics of racing    This time of years is generally slow in cycle racing(the real season doesn't start for a few more weeks(although the Tour of California starts in a little over a week). The big thing at the moment is Cyclocross(kind of like a running steeplechase, but with bicycles)
wU5vqXGyaa	Don't really think that there are specific exercises to increase your height, what I heard is that if you do lots of sports in general u tend to grow about 1 or 2 inches taller than if u didn't.  To me 5'11 for a 16 year old seems quite tall and considering boys tend to grow until their about 19 or even 20 u should reach at least 6'2. It was the same with my older brother who was about your height when he was 16. He still had a real boost in growth with 17 and 18 and grew like one more inch at 19. He now stands at 6'4, almost one whole foot taller than me :)  So don't worry, your gonna be pretty tall!|`|bTXDb5YIaa	dang i just turned 14 last week i'm 5 10

I mean, the whole reason that I see for using Yahoo Answers, is to get people's opinions, not to ask a question like this.      What I really don't get, is why you would ask that on here.  I mean, if you really want to know who won the 1999 series, all you have to do is type in any internet search "1999 World Series" and bam, a bunch of websites giving your answer.  I did so on yahoo search and the first result sends you to a wikipedia page that will give you the boxsores and everything about every game of the series.  You can get your answer right away rather than waiting for someone to answer your question.

NJMzhcKhaa	You're still in the prime age to start learning a Martial Art.    If I may suggest, start with BJJ first rather than Muay Thai. The younger you start in BJJ, the more flexible you are still and more capable you are to reach higher level of BJJ.  BJJ is a very technical MA and will be better for you at that age since it's a good development of both physical and technical capability. Plus, since full BJJ sparring is about rolling and grappling, less damage, less explanation to parents.  Once you reach 18-20, take the Muay Thai. The techniques will be easier for you to absorb by then, and if you've been diligent in training and develop the discipline, you will develop your Muay Thai quickly and able to participate in the more rigorous sparring sessions better.    I put emphasize in the sparring sessions as without proper sparring, you will never develop in the martial art you train in properly or reap the full potential of practicing martial art itself.|`|616f37abb5f6bb497fbb33bae765a7e2aa	I started Muay Thai at 17 and have been doing it 25 years now. I don't think your too late. Also keep up your Wrestling, its a good skill to have.|`|w9kSGLBxaa	Perfect age to start unless you want to wait until this age    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xO2kfgnoz...|`|kVEPQ3qcaa	Its great man. It will be good to start cuz your not in kid mode no more your getting bigger. So you will understand it more its never to late to start or end anything just put your mind to it and you will be ok. I've seen so many fights when a person on their first fight have won against supposly a living undefeatable win. So go for it what will it hurt to try something new for.    PS. Speed and Agility drills will help you alot in it.|`|BbK0fA4Laa	No way! You are just the right age to start martial arts!!!!!!You could be a master by the time you are 25 if you practice real hard and study a loooooot.
1VWUbxXjaa	The same amount they paid the refs against the seahawks a couple years back|`|LVjM9k8yaa	Waaaaaaaaaaa!    It's over, deal with it.    45-35  Enough Said!    Hook'em!!!|`|ZCCb38ikaa	I sent Mr. Rooney an email, and he told me he offered them $500,000 for each bad call. The only thing is, he forgot to tell them only for bad calls that help the Steelers.   Mr.Rooney did take away $500,000 for the bad calls against the Steelers, but the refs still went away with $2.5 million in the end. I asked Mr. Rooney why he would do such a thing, and he sent me back an email telling me I had won the Nigerian lottery. He's such a great guy!|`|tA5DrAPpaa	Not enough since the Steelers barely won.    That should have been a blowout.|`|PzAyT7Vwaa	How much did the Cardinals choke on defense with the lead and less than 2 1/2 minutes to play? Earth to Arizona.... defend Santonio Holmes!!!!|`|51e7baee76cfe5758f817c35c038f4c7aa	Let's see, the Cardinals benefited by 4 points when the first Steeler TD was overturned.  They benefited by 2 points (and got the ball back) when the hold was called in the end zone.  They benefited by 7 points after a Personal Foul on the next drive.  Plus another call got overturned giving them an incomplete pass instead of the Steelers getting a fumble recovery.    The Steelers benefited by 3 points on a drive with three personal fouls.    I have that as 13-3 in favor of the Cardinals.    Real athletes take responsibility for their own errors in a game.  Whiny fans blame the refs.|`|zqPjdhgKaa	Oh brother...  I would have to say the Steelers paid the refs just about how much the Cardinals paid them.  There were big blown calls on both sides, such as the opening drive when Ben Roethlisberger scored that touchdown, or the bunk safety call, or the other blown calls against the Steelers.  Quit looking for a scapegoat and deal with the fact that your team could not stop the Steelers.  They had plenty of chances to beat the Steelers, but they couldn't do it because they were the weaker team.  Even Whiz and most of the Cardinals as well as all analysts said the game was well officiated.  You obviously don't know NFL rules and how to interpret them.|`|UNT6fL5Daa	Take it easy. Be good to yourself. :)|`|uD0JiKISaa	HA|`|AA10315681	HaHa|`|w4EfMCMZaa	they never paid the refs..... santonio holmes is really good that is how they won. i was rooting for the cards but i gotta hand it to holmes that was a great catch|`|AA12020487	A ******** lol.... oh and its cardinals.... can you say spell check|`|YCwmCDkUaa	They didn't so stop your crying.    Maybe you should pay your spelling teacher a little more...the abbreviation for referree is REF and the team is the CARDINALS.    Also, there is a new thing called punctuation.  You should look into it.|`|UwVf7Cpaaa	It was a bad note on a great game for real, refs are never perfect but that was pretty lame all around by the officials, on the field and upstairs. Wish they could just get their stuff together|`|I65rsnCnaa	Jealousy tastes bad doesn't it?|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	The officiating was ok, no problems. Losers always yell for better officials. I had my money on Arizona, lost it.|`|a6EndAPiaa	However much it was it was not enough!!!    The refs overturned 2 calls in the Cardinals favor and they called a hold on the Steelers in the end zone resulting in a safety.    If I had paid them I would be so mad!!!  I would demand my money back!!        Come on be serious the refs were not paid off.|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	awwwwwwwwwwwww|`|KNTofuxMaa	*sigh*    This is old now, folks.|`|eIOlBzm8aa	They didn't Goodell tipped off the refs to look the other way when Holmes got up and celebrated.|`|KR3IvxNwaa	they paid the refs all season long.|`|HpPNg0heaa	they were stupid on some calls they made on the steelers too
soNnNFa4aa	carbo load, drink lots of water, stretch A LOT|`|N0sbhRu6aa	Eat a pizza. Has lots of carbs in it. But make sure it is one hour before the game. Also, drink about 6 glasses of water before you play because you'll lose a lot more.|`|41m6RZ4Jaa	carbs and water, and also medidtate positively
VTN4Qun9aa	Laurinitis is a decent, well-coached player, but he doesn't have even half of Maluaga's athleticism.  Laurinitis is a stud in college, but I'm not sure if he's athletic enough to be a game-changer in the NFL.  I'd pick Maluaga every time.|`|WxmNSxNGaa	Most of the scouts are calling Maualuga a two down linebacker. He overpursues and sucks in pass coverage. He has a great highlight reel, but he runs himself out of the play more often than not.     Lauranitis is a better pass rusher, he's better in pass coverage, he's faster, he's more consistent, and he's a leader on the field. It's really no contest. He's the better player by a mile.|`|ZpqFN3vXaa	Maualuga by a mile    Laurenitis isnt even a first round pick|`|c819b9c0e601697d9b53e747cb45c707aa	Two things are for sure , The Scouts and NFL Teams like USC and Ohio State Players because they are well Coached and Fundamentally sound and make solid NFL Players ( Except Troy Smith and Lienhart not sure what happened there . ) , the statistics speaks for itself .    Have a Great Weekend|`|eIOlBzm8aa	Lauranitis? Are you serious? Maualuga is the only one they pick. Maybe if they ran a 4-3 they would look at Lauranitis(bust).|`|gzRZlfpLaa	LAurenitis  ....... |....  ........|..........2 points ..........|||"|""\__  ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)  ---------------------IM A MACK-----------------  ------------------ (and your a pc)---------------|`|xxtvhn5Naa	Maualuga is much better, I think that if he is still around when the Chargers get their draft pick, they will take him, not because they desperately need a LB as much a O & D line, DB and RB, but he way to much talent to pass up.|`|rM9WzIkHaa	i like Maualuga hopefully he gets drafted by the 9ers|`|yWcPOTsAaa	Maualuga to the Raiders|`|yLTDUZIDaa	Laurenitis, because they blitz a lot out of the 4-3 and Laurenitis is one of if not the best blitzer at Ohio State... Better than Maualuga, but he is a local boy so you never know.|`|UwVf7Cpaaa	Maualuga by far, no contest|`|1efd1cd9d8745f60513bb2f944c14131aa	Def going to have to go with Rey Maualuga here. I mean he appears to be like Troy Polamalu but at LB. Can it get any better than that? seriously...Rey seems to be faster as well...    Edit: to the person below me...can you imagine a Shawn Merriman, Maualuga pass rush....owwww...just painful|`|Dunc379maa	Laurenitis is a better pass coverage guy and Maualuga maybe a better "fill in the gap" type of backer. I think Laurenitis may work out better in the pros because of the passing and Maualuga is slower than Laurenitis as Maualuga runs a 4.75 - 40 yard dash and Laurenitis runs a 4.68 - 40 yard dash and Laurenitis seems like he is more intelligent. But Ray Maualuga is a beast. Either way, some NFL team is going to be real happy to get either one of these giants. Maualuga is about as heavy as he is going to get for his body frame, maybe adding another 10 pounds but Laurenitis can add another 25 pounds which would put him up there as being huge once that happens.......what a great combo.
BwFZJ9Nraa	Really bad call... I don't understand how refs can be so inconsistent.  One play Paul Pierce gets undressed by Kobe and no call and then next possession he doesn't even get touched and they call a foul.  That call cost the Celtics the game because KG's presence was missed from that point on.  I also think Ray was fouled BEFORE the shot at the buzzer.  I think the shot was clean but Fisher rode him like a bull from the wing to the top of the key. But, it's over, time to move on!|`|IRyWEvoFaa	Is that the only bad call you saw in the game, did you see kevin push pau during that play?  The refs did the lakers no justice lastnight but it was to be expected in boston.  The lakers won,  that makes twice this season, they gave boston a Christmas present that they wasn't to happy for.  That's what kevin gets, he should've been fouled out he's always trying to push people around on the court but someone is going to put him in his place in front of millions one day.|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	BS  Ticky tacky  Some Laker players were knocked flat and no call.  Celtics are famous for rough play.|`|i0Igqvroaa	uhm according to what i saw, kg was the one who shoved fisher out of the way to prevent the steal|`|urqGJPwpaa	They missed a call, but the call on Garnett was the right call, he pushed off on Fisher.

J6xmZqj1aa	Wow, don't lisen to what those morons say, only an idiot who doesn't know what the hell is doing on would post such mean things.  But be very careful with your weight, I'm sure you've heard it before, but adding weight, up to 30 pounds more wouldn't hurt you.  Ofcourse I've never seen you so I really have no clue what to say on that subject.     You improve by training, below is the advice I gave to another runner, she was interested in competing, if you are not then you should not be as agresive.  Do less of the cross training, and you schedule can be more flexible if you're just doing the mile in pe.    The most important thing to do is to lisen to you body, and take it easy when you are feeling overly sore, or you are injured.  Have fun and be a kid    This routine is a variation of Brad Hudsons adaptive running theory/method. When you are young a strong base is most important check out the marathon preformanct link and click on youth development tab.    Not all of you runs should be at the same legenth or speed, the repetion bores the muscles, stunts your fittness, and results in serious injury. A good program that you can tailor to your needs follows: Sunday: rest, Monday: easy slow and short, Tuesday: threshold/ long intervals( a speed day but not super short and fast, a fartlek is a good way to start), Wednesday: easy recovery, Thursday: super speed day, start easy and work into some more intese fartleks, and/or track workouts, Friday: recovery nothing hard, Saturday: long run not to fast and no longer than 50 minutes.    About the abs; only 20 reps of one move is not enough (try to start with 3 minutes a few times a week and work up from there to 7-15), and once again variation will go a long way in engageing th muscles and preventing injury. I can't recomend any piticular moves, but check out the Runners World link and explore the site for some more moves. Try not to ignore the back, butt, or stabalizing muscles, us runners have a tendancy to have really bad backs.    Sorry and misspellings, and good luck. By the way i do all of this stuff myself and i'm in great shape for track, it dosen't take more that 3 hours a day (running included) Let me know how it works|`|00sMjV8Qaa	And we should care because why??|`|Glg1uph7aa	i wouldnt post questions liek this on the internet.  people who jsut dont get it post stuff to be funny and people know its ajoke but it still impacts their self esteem.  im 14 and im about 5'11.  i way about 135 lbs.  i run a 6-7 minute mile.  although i did run a 5 minute 53 second miloe once.  just keep a regular diet.  the best way to get better at runnning is just keep running.  myabe those stairmaster things so u can pump ur legs when u wanna sprint.|`|RofOwl2Jaa	okay well 9 min is TOO bad, but its not great either :/ i usually would run a 6-7 min mile, but i didnt run all winter i got down to a 9 min... totally distraught anyways... you should not just run a mile every day, for one thing its bad to exercise every day... it can do bad things to your legs and joints in the long run. my mom over exercised when she was young and just a month ago she had to have 4 SURGERIES to fix the damage 0.o    okay, you should run 4-5 days a week. and when you run, each time increase your distance/time, depending if you want to run further in 10 min or run a shorter mile. my xc coach always said that if you want to improve a distance time, you should always run more than that distance when you practice.     that way when you do run that distance it is easier and you can push yourself harder :)    GOOD LUCK!!!! oh and ignore the idiots criticizing your weight. youre naturally skinny, and thats fine. i have a friend who is your weight and height, age to :P she always gets picked on for her weight, but tbh she (not to sound lezbo) has a great body, and probably has the best in our grade xD|`|IITnJjAjaa	9 minutes is good, you are quite a bit underweight for your height. To give you an idea, i am 14, 5 foot 5, around 105 pounds and run a 5:50 mile. The average mile time is about 8 minutes, so your not far off! You improve it by simply training more, i cannot give you a training regime, i don't know you but i would join an athletics club if you want to improve.|`|ApF2fANQaa	Im 16 and 140 pounds and 5'7. I run a mile in 6:50 so that gives you a idea.  Also go eat :D|`|65b0iIRNaa	There's really no average, everyone is different, even with the same body type. If you want to start running though you need to up the calorie intake, especially if you're only 90 lbs.   I'm sure you can improve on 9 minutes, but it wont happen by running once a week, if you want to improve develop a regular route- it doesn't have to be a mile but a decent run to get your heart pumping.   Be sure to stretch! Before and after or all you'll be left with is sore muscles and that doesn't help your mile =P|`|MfxHpLVWaa	HA please, gain some weight, you are too skinny really. I run the mile in 5:30, and i am 19 yr old girl but i am 119 pounds and 5'6.... Start eating more... not junk food, but healthy food and alot of protein so you can build muscle but not put on fat though. You really in all honestly should be about 100-110 pounds. The good thing about having such a low weight, is your body type, and i am assuming you are an ectomorph, produces some of the fastest distance runners in the world. It is harder for someone like me, who is an mesomorph to succeed as a distance runner.     Here is a sample of my workout routine (and by all means please dont follow it, as i highly doubt you are running as much as me and you dont want to get injured)    Monday: workout of seven 800 meter intervals at 2:55  Tuesday- 40 minute easy run  Wednesday: six 400 meter intervals at 1:15  Thursday: 40 minutes easy  Friday: 50 minutes easy  Saturday: long run/tempo 8 miles @ 7:30-8:00 pace  Sunday- off      What you need to do to improve your time, is work yourself up to something like this... You need a lot of speed work, but you also need the endurance to hold that speed, which is where the distance comes in. I probably do a little more than I should for the mile, but I am actually training for the 3000 meter steeple chase in outdoor track. Fun stuff :) Hope this helps

IF they are lucky one of the staff may have played baseball in college but for the most part it is handled like an secondary income position for teachers. It may be easier to take on an assistant job first some are paid and some are volunteer. But it is a foot in the door. From my own experience, qualifications and knowledge mean nothing in most school district for hiring of coaches. My sons district had a former d-1 asst. coach and all american player apply but not being a district teacher he was looked over. I would suggest volunteer or find a job in the district.

4349e8160556cc383c890ace0bee032caa	La realidad actual del Futbol Mexicano no esta en darle una oportunidad a Hugo Sanchez. Mexico se encuentra en una realidad poco clara, es decir, si bien es cierto que Mexico se puede enfrentar a una gran potencia y dar un excelente juego o bien enfrentarse a un equipo de una jerarquia inferior a la suya y no sobresalir no brillar en lo mas minimo; esto no significa que Mexico muestro un retroceso en lo futbolistico sino que es una etapa incierta entre lo que hace un grande o un equipo " X".    Aunado a lo anterior, la pregunta deberia ser si Hugo es el indicado?? En lo personal considero que no es el hombre adecuado para tomar las riendas del Tricolor, no por los conflictos que se puedan dar entre diversas instituciones (llamense medios de comunicacion, Clubs y altos mandos de la FMF) sino que la incertidumbre radica en la posibilidad de que futbolisticamente ( no motivacionalmente ) pueda aportar algo nuevo al seleccionado. Creo que existen otros DT mexicanos como el Vasco (obviamente no toma el Tri en estos momentos), Trejo que es una persona muy seria y profesional en todos sus aspectos, y porque no hablar de un tecnico extranjero?? es otra posible solucion. En lo particular creo que se deberia dar continuidad a Ricardo Lavolpe en el certamen de la Copa America, en nuestra realidad creo que Mexico tiene dos rivales a vencer Brasil y Argentina, si no se gana la copa (que es muy probable que se llegue a la final sin embargo dificil de presagiar una coronacion por los dos rivales antes mencionados) que ahora si se busque un estratega para dirigir al seleccionado mexicano para afrontar los siguientes compromisos.|`|65600c67ca5b64dd2a34513524f3f484aa	SE LE HA DADO OPORTUNIDAD A TODOS, POR QUE NO DARSELA A HUGO SANCHEZ, HA DEMOSTTRADO GRANDES CAPACIDADES AL ENTRENAR AL PUMAS, Y CHECA HASTA DONDE LO LLEVO.

AA11619136	The best answer is this... Speed matters only if it is mixed with accuracy, drive, and the right attitude.    The last ultimately being first on most coaches/scouts list.  I have seen many scouts and D1-3 coaches go to a game to watch a certain player.  Only to leave the field with his name crossed off the list because of his work ethic, attitude, and the way he handles his role on the team.  Typically there is a new person on the list that excerted those atributes and impressed the coach.    I have seen a lot of good, high velocity pitchers who never make it to college and end up working there way through the minors. Many never make it out... they throw hard but are bone heads on and off the field. These guys never mature and come into there own as leaders.    Typically D-1 guys will be throwing upper 80's with a few touching low to mid 90's.    D-2 guys are typically low to mid 80's with a few touching high 80's    D-3 are typically about the same.    The key here is this is where they are at the begining of there collegiate careers.  Many coaches will look for guys they think they can work on... they may spot a tendency in the throw they can correct and build the players arm and accuracy,    THe same goes for the pro's.  There is also something to be said for experience.  Pro's and Colleges alike will look at a player coming from warm weather states (year round ball) and see a kid with 5-7 years more experience than a guy from a northern state that plays a fraction of the games that a warm weather state player would.  Pro's and Con's  Pro - More experience for the warm (Calif., Texas, Florida) weather player.  Con - Arm might be overworked and bad technque could make it vulnerable to injury.  Pro's for the cold weather state player are a fresher arm.  Con's less experience and exposure.    The reality is this...  Your attitude, hustle, and work ethic on and off the field will get you to a D-1 school even if you are three or four miles per hour slower than the basket case.     If you want to build speed work on your long toss regimen in the off season and consider hiring a competent pitching coach to evaluate your technique or attend some of the high level pitching clinics.  I highly recommend Tom House's program.  Well tested and clinicaly sound advice.    Good Luck!|`|AA12169483	Firstly, speed doesn't matter as much as your accuracy.  Also you should be able to throw some pitches with good movement.  If fastball is your only pitch, you should throw it in the 90s, and be very accurate for any chance at playing college ball.  Unless you can throw in the high 90s, you need to have good movement, as well as offspeed pitches, in addition to your fastball, to have any kind of a successful career.|`|AA12237330	The only qualification is that the college must believe you can get hitters out.

When I went o a D-1 school, I was a starter who threw 78-83 MPH, by the time I left college I was throwing between 87-90 MPH, and by the time I got hurt playing pro ball I was throwing 90-92.  Velocity has nothing to do with success.  You think Greg Maddux will be in the Hall of Fame in 7 years because he throws hard no way.  He hits his spots and has great movement.

AA12396832	Since Oakland has a legitimate chance of winning the AL West, Billy Beane will probably keep Zito. With Rich Harden on the shelf until September, Oakland needs Zito. Although they will definitely lose him after the season, it looks like Oakland is going to make a push to get to the World Series this year. Even though it means risking getting nothing in return for Zito. It's a delicate balance that Beane is walking. It will be sad to see Barry in Yankees pinstripes come next season.|`|c54de16e5f66dbc2f55be03fb63b269faa	Barry Zito is the last of the big three to remain in Oakland for a reason.  BILLY BEANE loves ZITO!  Billy's not going to trade ZITO for anything this year!  He's a Cy Young Award Winner!  Billy knows that the A's need to stay in the race and the only way to do that is to hold on to the Ace of the team and that's Barry Zito!  The only BARRY in the BAY!|`|AA12062760	The only way I want the Mets to trade Milledge to Oakland for Zito is if we can sign him to an extension.  And with Scott Boras in the picture now that may be impossible as he wants to "test the waters"  Oakland should just keep him for the stretch unless they are blown away.|`|348a1bbb3e0303ae345fff9104174673aa	They should definately trade Zito to the New York Yankees. Yankees need the pitching arm that Zito can give to them. On the other hand, Oakland can get the fire power they need to make their team a gauranteed spot in the playoffs. You know the Yankees are loaded with batters that can make a pitchers nightmare.|`|089b44f9b0c774651bd69225d8b358d6aa	as of now i don't think they should trade him...but if they do my pick would be to the mets for lastings miledge bc they're last in on base %, runs, and a whole bunch of offensive catigories in the Majors. How they do in the next few days will determine they trade him or not. Because once harden is 100% healthy he can be the ace of this staff, and MIllegde would make a fine fit in the oakland lineup. With the big hurt, who is still hitting HR's (2 last night), and Chavez and the rest of the guys in that line up, with milledge...i smell AL west division winners|`|AA11881705	Oakland should not trade Zito.  Right now they are one of the front runners in the AL West race.  As you should know, the  1 thing that helps you win down the stretch and in the playoffs is good pitching, so I don't see how trading your best lefty pitcher would help you to make the playoffs.

E' troppo facile trovare in Berlusconi la causa scatenante dell'odio per il Milan, ed  fastidioso subire continui rinfacci perch abbiamo un presidente cos. Sul fatto delle sentenze.....dico innanzitutto che il Milan come societ non esce sicuramente candido e pulito dalla situazione Calciopoli, come d'altronde tutto il calcio; e ve lo dice un Milanista.    Ci che per  importante,  che in tutti i processi, pur sportivi che siano, (tanto non c' differenza), le indagini e le sentenze si fanno con ci che hanno a disposizione inquirenti e giudici. Da quello che avevano a disposizione sul tavolo questi signori sono emerse queste situazioni pittosto diversificate tra le squadre coinvolte. Da tempo si sapeva che il Milan era dal punto di vista formale la societ meno coinvolta e le sentenze scaturite non devono destare perplessit.   Se non ci fossero diversificazioni, il diritto non esisterebbe, saremmo sempre tutti colpevoli allo stesso modo.    Il fatto che fa perdere lucidit di giudizio riguardo al Milan soprattutto agli amici della juve  che Berlusconi se la sia "scampata" pure in ambito sportivo, nonostante si siano messi sulle sue tracce 2 "scagnozzi" come  Borrelli e Guido Rossi.  Questo deve evidentemente far capire che la situazione della societ Milan non era cos grave, perch significa che non c'era modo di STANGARE il nano di ARCORE.    Il REATO ti condanna, ma non la PRESUNZIONE di tale REATO..... questo che non deve far tormentare soprattutto i tifosi della Juve pensando che la pena pi giusta per il Milan (e in 2 piano x Fiorentina e Lazio) sarebbe stata la serie B come la Juve perch tutti colpevoli allo stesso modo dello stesso reato....    Mettiamo che una persona venga arrestata e condannata a 20 anni di reclusione per rapina a mano armata ed il suo complice che portava la macchina fuori dalla banca a 3 anni di reclusione.  Sarebbe accolto dalla corte il reclamo del rapinatore se dicesse .....>.....sarebbe aumentata la pena del complice e portata alla pari del rapinatore?  Domanda retorica: risposta NO.    Ultimo punto  il fatto che alla giustizia, seppur sportiva che sia, va data piena fiducia. I giudici e gli esperti avranno fatto il loro lavoro e saranno giunti alle loro serene conclusioni come dei seri professionisti, quindi nelle sentenze non ci possono essere ingiustizie. Sarebbe come appoggiare i dubbi di Berlusconi sull'imparzialit della Giustizia......il che  tutto dire.|`|65c7e8cd373e5d15008026758db98355aa	Proposta rifiutata!!!!!

AA10306753	It's hard to say what might have kept him from being the all-time hits leader. You have to appreciate that he played 20 seasons with San Diego, but upon looking at the link below, he averaged 122 games per season. Now, given his injuries the last two seasons and the part-time play of his rookie season, perhaps he averaged more than that when relatively healthy. Straight up, though, he missed (on average) 40 games per season - over 20 seasons, that's 800 total games, or the equivalent of (almost) 5 full seasons.    He had 3141 hits over 20 seasons, or an average of 157.5 hits per season. Extrapolate that rate (157.5 hits in 122 games) to 162 games, and you get just over 209 hits per *full* season. Over 20 seasons, that's 4182 hits.....*if* he plays those 3240 consecutive games.    As you can see, it would have been a tough road for him to have passed Rose's 4256 hits, especially since he played the outfield much of his career. I don't think weight is the main factor - Rose was just a freak.|`|063327825fa1f5bf21e56f047c951627aa	No, Tony was a great hitter but I don't think he could have caught Cobb or Rose.|`|AA11998809	You never know.

Ischia o Cag?a tienen la escuela de Bianchi,deberia ser uno de ellos|`|7d00d0ebb6e6b7c4dac10b1aea8474deaa	La Volpe  porque si le dan el apoyo necesario va a ser cosas grandes con Boca ya que aqu en Mjico a mucha gente no le gustan los extranjeros y eso lo demostraron con poco apoyo a La Volpe en la seleccin|`|6cd283485999d39c6256fba45c913254aa	ser DT de Boca es cosa seria .Aca no se puede andar con cualquier nombre,por lo tanto vay a nalizar los nombres dados por la prensa:     La Volpe: Es un tecnico que tiene cero experiencia dirigiendo el futbol argentino ,hace 26 a?os que vive en mexico en palabras textuales suyas dijo en numeradas ocaciones que se siente mas mexicano q argentino ;eso si ahora se acordo que nacio en tierras australes y saco su chapa de campeon mundial con argentina .  lo bueno de le es que es un tecnico serio, con mucha personalidad(algo q para dirigir a boca ase falta)y que a tenido buenos resultados.  Miguel Russo:el actual dt de Velez es la opcion favorita de Maradona y no es para menos ,es un tecnico q te asegura seriedad, perfil bajo ,buen futbol,resultados y algo muy importante hoy en dia :desarrollo de inferiores.  Si hay interes ,el contrato con Velez...........se rompe  Marcelo Bielsa: quien te dice que ahora que no hay tanto apuro el loco cambie de opinion .........................Macri lo quiere.  Es un tecnico raro pero bastante efectivo fuera del hecho q la seleccion del '02 jugo horrible luego lo compenso jugando una olimpiada fenomenal.  Gerardo Martino:a mi gusto lo unico a favor q tiene es q elimino a River por la libertadores ,porque todavia no gano nada y no hay q olvidarse que cuando dirigio  en 1ra division en argentina no le fue bien.  carlos Ischia: QUIEN ES ????????????  Gallego: NOOOOOO, porque es gallina y punto  Maradona:definidamente no esta para dirigir un equipo de futbol.    Coclucion el nuevo tecnico de Boca se definira entre Bielsa,si lo convencen, la Volpe u otro 3er nombre sorpresa que puede ser del exterior|`|39988cb33005dc735d758e49b5711b00aa	LAVOLPE!  ?????  QUIEN MAS - YA VES QUE BIEN LE FUE A MEXICO!    ES EL CANDIDATO MAS FUERTE?    Yo pienso que LaVolpe es bueno; nadamas que en Mexico en equipos locales era una cosa y en la seleccion era otra!   PERO en cualquier equipo es buen director tecnico!  HIZO milagros con los mexicanos que llevo al mundial;  (HIZO MILAGROS CON LOS JUGADORES QUE SELECCIONO PARA MEXICO!)  Es la primera vez que Mexico fue cabeza de serie....    (Imaginate que podria hacer con BOCA JRS.; y con los jugadores que tienen - VAN A GANAR TODO - SE VAN A EN RACHAR!!!)|`|ad87560045b03e464ab10b151595c6a6aa	Lobo Zagallo|`|e8c06c6755aa7f2a5da59d73430272eaaa	Han habido muchos rumores de los cuales voy a opinar:    - Lavolpe: Ex tcnico de la Seleccin Mexicana. Supo dirigir de manera correcta este equipo, muy bien en la parte ofensiva. De todas formas, no me cierra su llegada a Boca.    - Martino: Ex jugador de Newell's. Actualmente forma parte del Cuerpo Tcnico de Libertad de Paraguay. Trabaja bien y podra ser una buena opcin.    - Bianchi: Gran tcnico. Le ha dado a Boca Juniors grandes victorias. Sin dudas, serala persona IDEAL para ocupar el puesto que Basile deja libre.     - Russo: Ex jugador de Estudiantes. Logr que varios equipos pertenecientes al Nacional B pasaran a Primera A. Tambin es una opcin valedera para Boca.    Con respecto a algo que escuch por ah, que Pele podra llegar a ser tecnico de Boca. Confirmo que absolutamente una mentira, nunca se pas por la cabeza de los dirigentes de Boca esa opcin.|`|405c41402b7247635aec061f8328aa10aa	Deberian buscar a Bianchi,... es un tipo muy grosso y nos dio muchas alegrias como tecnico.  En lo personal no me convence LaVolpe ni Martino, pero... quien dice.  Ischia por ser una persona muy cercana a Bianchi podria ser una opcion validera.|`|8f976783e04f1499a86c2b4418f13a7baa	El DT de Boca debera ser un tcnico con experiencia, Lavolpe no me convence... en realidad porque nunca lo vi dirigir ac y en Mxico sali campen 1 vez, Cagna no dirigi nunca y la verdad que para empezar en Boca no lo veo... mucha presin, Ischia es posible, estubo con Bianchi conoce a los players (como diria el Coco) pero no es Bianchi... Maradona... jeje bueh... que diriga algo antes... la experiencia con Mandiy no fue de las mejroes. Bianchi no va a querer, vaya uno a saber porque... Bielsa, tampoco, siglos deben pasar para que Bielsa agarre algo... yo digo... un Bilardo que tiene ganas... se nota que als tiene no sera una mala opcion... me la jugara por Bilardo... pero solamente es una opinion personal|`|e0742a22327c3c21f6d2eb6ebaf83e62aa	Lavolpe ya que ni sabe dirigir

e8f5a0766f1cc77f53b67ccfcbc48289aa	David Ortiz in a landslide not even gunna be close one hr away from 40 and there is still two months of baseball to play the guy is gunna hit atleast 55 hrs this year there is no chance he doesnt get MVP|`|AA11603346	Albert Pujols|`|8a464defdaeeb19a2f98ce574128e13baa	The most likely? David Ortiz in the American League, and Albert Pujols in the National League. The most deserving? Derek Jeter in the American League, and Ryan Howard in the National League. Jeter's having an amazing year. Batting .355 and doing everything within his power to carry the Yankees. With Matsui, Sheffield, and Cano out, and even guys like Rodriguez and Giambi struggling at the plate, Jeter's always been there. He is the captain of the Yankees, and boy has he played like it and more.|`|4228b7c8133afece148965e9d2ed7e4caa	david ortiz because he is a big key to their offense because he is so clutch.|`|87826378f29595e6b5b7bf66af6c52d3aa	David Ortiz  Albert Pujols|`|AA12237330	Pujols in the NL.

Manny Ramirez also has a good chance, but David Ortiz is just awesome.|`|AA11464866	well theres an AL MVP and a NL one, there isnt one of all MLB so, derek jeter, AL and albert pujols, NL|`|AA12159953	David Wright or Ortiz|`|fb8683efbe281f9bfd3307ebd4b99e3faa	other  alfonso soriano. he will be traded to a better team and he'll catch fire. he already has 34 HR|`|AA12220241	BIg Papi David Ortiz, Jeter will be close  NL will be someone from the Mets
AA10697471	His son Skip Caray and his grandson Chip Caray have followed him into the booth as baseball broadcasters. The younger Caray was actually hired by WGN-TV to work with his grandfather, but Harry died before that pairing could take place. Chip Caray replaced Harry as the Cubs' play-by-play announcer from 1998 to 2004, then left the Cubs to work with his father Skip on Atlanta Braves broadcasts  NO BROTHER  St. Louis Cardinals, the Chicago White Sox and the Chicago Cubs  Oakland Athletics for the 1970 season|`|c5aaaa7bc0de5169e89cff41344a3c80aa	Harry Caray never had a brother, therefore he could not have announced games.  His son, Skip has been an Atlanta Braves announcer since the 1960's.....his son, Chip, started announcing for Seattle, moved on to the Cubs and is now one of the Braves announcers also.    As I said yesterday when I answered this identical question - Harry Caray didn't have a brother!!!!|`|d4457cd5d38b035003a1e47b7cef449aaa	John Cena lied to you because Harry Caray didn't have a brother, he probably meant figuratively... like Will Ferrell or something but Will Ferrell impersonated Harry Caray on SNL.|`|AA12237330	Why is this question being asked again and again?  Is there some stupid trivia contest that asks a question with no right answer?
