A senior European Union official touring war-torn Gaza has blamed the ruling militant movement Hamas for the humanitarian crisis there.       Humanitarian aid chief Louis Michel called the destruction left by Israel's offensive "abominable", but said Hamas bore "overwhelming responsibility".       He said there would be no dialogue with the "terrorist" movement until it gave up violence and recognised Israel.     http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7... 
20090128195755AAv9pIm	Travel;Mexico;Other - Mexico	Cheap Vacation to Mexico?	I am looking for a vacation to either cabo san lucas or puerto vallarta Mexico. I was wondering if there is a website that has cheap vacation deals. There are four of us and two are leaving from Chicago and two are leaving from Houston. We wanted to stay in the same room together so most places we have to just book the hotel. We were looking for an all-inclusive vacation and want it to be beach front. We are thinking no more than $450 a person for the week. Does anyone know where I can find good deals on vacations to mexico? And also what are some good hotels to stay at there?

However, the two regions are quite a bit away.  Is there a cheap way to travel between the two like a train or bus?  Or would a plane be better?      Also, I will be backpacking, and although I'm sure I'll look like a tourist, if there are any other cities you recommend that might be a little smaller than the very touristy "golden triangle" cities, then I would be very willing to hear about those destinations.

Yet we are so quick to be the judge of Hispanics African Americans and any other person out there trying to make a better life for themselves. Hispanic people come here to give their children a better chance at life and an education. Just because they don't speak our language or have our color of skin doesn't make them different from any of us. They do learn our language eventually and hopefully others take the time to learn theirs. As for worrying about them taking our jobs why don't we try working for next to nothing and then maybe we wouldn't have to worry anymore. As for the crime drugs gangs etc...we have that anyway where ever we go so its not just them that contribute to the statistics its everyone. So have you ever really thought about why we are so quick to judge others?

20090225145627AALXEUp	Travel;Africa & Middle East;South Africa	This one's for residents of Durban, South Africa....?	I am a South African who has been living in Europe for the past 7 years.  I have potentially been offered a job in Durban and am having trouble deciding whether I should accept it or not.... It would be super fantastic if you (as Durban residents) could answer the following questions to help me decide:      1)  How much is a reasonable salary in Durban (i.e. allowing one to save)?      2)  What is the average rent of a one-bedroom flat in a decent (i.e. safe, etc.) area?      3)  How much could I expect to pay for bills (i.e. water, electricity, etc.) on a monthly basis?      4)  How easy is it to find a job and what are the best job sites to use?(my partner will be joining me)      I do realise that the above questions are very general and dependant on individual situations and many other factors, however all I'm looking for is a rough idea to help me decide whether this move would be worth it.  Finances are the main factor that will determine my decision.      I would appreciate for as many of you as possible to answer this question.....       You have no idea how much you would be helping me!! Thank you so much!

This is a sort-of "cleansing" trip and I'm looking for very peaceful places to visit and, like I said, just "cleanse" myself. Sounds pretty weird but any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

20090128192951AACB7Wz	Travel;Air Travel	Do I have to re-check my baggage during a layover for an international flight?	Ok, I'm flying to the UK this spring/summer.  I am leaving from Atlanta (ATL) and have a 3 hour layover in Chicago (ORD) before I finally fly overseas.  I am flying with the same airline (American Airlines) the entire time, and would like to know if I have to get and recheck my baggage when I land in Chicago for said layover.       I've never flown internationally or anywhere that required a layover, so I'm really very ignorant about this.  Honestly my biggest fear is losing my luggage, I've had it happen to a lot of friends and it's just too much hassle and headache.

20090128193729AAj1Su2	Travel;Australia;Sydney	What is the best university in Australia for international students?	I am currently in the USA but want to attend a university in Australia after high school. I know it sounds crazy, but it's just one of this opportunities I want to take advantage of. What's the best university there for international students? How much should I expect to pay (please specify if you're talking in AUD or USD)? Is it even worth it? Just fyi, I plan to become an elementary school teacher or do something that involves writing (nothing crazy). I know there are websites for this but the whole "different prices for different subjects/varying amount of time to graduate" confuses me (it's not like that here). Thank you!

20090128202113AAAqrYk	Travel;Air Travel	Is there something wrong with people who are mad that airlines are delaying their flights?	The news reporters are interviewing airport passengers on the evening news.  And these passengers are complaining that their flights were delayed and that they're "inconvenienced" and "late for vacation."      Are people really that dumb?  If the airline managers think it's too unsafe to fly, would a sane person question that and complain about it?      Ah, yes, perhaps it's just the good old "The World Revolves Around Me" epidemic which seems to be sweeping across America.
