It's a small sprayer connected to a compressor, that sprays a fine mist of color, whatever you pick, very delicately if done right.  Don't know how soon you're planning your wedding, but I'd get one and do some practicing before doing the actual pieces.   The craft stores should be able to help with procurement, supplies and possibly use instructions.

They should dissolve eventually.|`|OUcQjqI0aa	the noodles wont dissolve with boiling water.  you need to get a drain snake and snake the noodles out.    don't eat in the bathroom, that's gross.|`|9d9f34fe1144f6f0a8ddf5093f4fcdf7aa	First a scolding - stop eating your Ramen noodles in the bath tub.  This is not the good kind of multi-tasking.    Second - Hot water will not solve this problem.    You have a couple of choices - remove the noodles physically or chemically.  Chemically is the easiest.  Just pour a half bottle of Draino down the drain and wait a half hour.  Should be gone but you may have to repeat.  For the physical removal (do not attempt after the chemical removal without first draining lots of water down the pipes - chemical burns = pain), remove the drain cover.  If the noodles are visible, remove them with whatever instrument you can fit down there.  If they are not visible, spend $5 at Northern Tool and buy a drain snake.  Use the snake to break up the noodles so they pass down the drain with water.
Jh7CmSa8aa	I have to say, if all of that is on one branch circuit I would be amazed.  I believe you need to check your main breaker.  Even though it may say "on" one half can trip and not flip the handle to the off position.    Go in this sequence:  Turn off your main.  Turn off all the individual circuit breakers.  Turn the main back on.  One by one, begin turning the individual breakers back on.    If the theories above are correct, then all of the stuff that is off should come back on at one time, with one breaker.  If you see that they come on in different intervals, then it's not a single circuit but in fact your main.    Hope this helps.|`|jWtquDVUaa	Sounds like you have an awful lot on one circuit. Try to turn all your breakers off then back on if they are not marked. Because it certainly sounds like one is tripped. Then afterward if everything has to stay where it is, try not to use many things at the same time.|`|uslsfE1Uaa	go back to your circuit box and start one at a time turning them off and back on,some time a circuit will break but the switch will appear turned on.|`|2jdYb4lmaa	Look to see if there is a reset button on the outlet where the water heater and t.v. are plugged into. If so, unplug the water heater and press the button. If the t.v. and others come on, then your water heater tripped the breaker in that outlet by pulling too much current. Anything that creates heat pulls a lot of current. You will have to turn off other things when using the water heater.|`|8zZFXUGSaa	Is any of the outlets a GFI by chance? Go turn off each breaker and reset them. Get a receptacle tester from radio shack, lowe's, home depot, etc. This device plugs into your outlet and lets you know what the power is doing. Is it on, polarity reversed,, open ground or neutral, etc. The problem could be any where. If you feel confident, take the cover off your panel and tighten down the screws to the wires REMEMBER: the power is on, turn off the breakers you are working on and DO NOT TOUCH ANY METAL. Have someone else there just in case. When in doubt, turn off the breakers and go through the outlets 1 at a time tightening all connections. ALWAYS assume power is on! Be careful. If you do not feel confident, then call an electrician.

Eventually it should all come up, then rinse with clean water and a drop of detergent to remove the hairspray.  You may have to sand the area slightly to give the paint an edge and to remove any lingering ink left.  But a thorough cleaning with CHEAP, not EXPENSIVE hairspray should do the trick!  Good luck!  Hope this helps you out!|`|TZN0v8r4aa	You can try bleach or hydrogen peroxide.|`|AA10097817	Rubbing alcohol is best on ink, but not sure it will work now.

Also give the Mr Clean Magic Eraser a try.   I've had good results with those when I had to remove ink marks from my kitchen counters.
pffEqA9aaa	What's probably happening is that the house air would have had slightly lower humidity than the 29% max you mentioned if the humidifier hadn't been installed.  Because your home is probably well insulated the heat doesn't cycle on very often.  The humidifier only adds humidity when the heater fan is blowing, so it's really only designed to partially counteract the drying effect of heating the air.    Another possibility, is that it hasn't been running long enough yet (it may take a few days to make a noticeable improvement).
9440e28b2ef820fd5eab4d5cfc34217faa	My deepest sympathies: My little abode was ant hill central for many years!    This is a recipe that someone else on Answers posted:    1/4 cup sugar  2 tablespoons Borax  3/4 cup hot water    Stir everything together until the borax and sugar dissolve, them dip pieces of bread crust in the solution. Put the crusts where the ants will get at them, but the pets won't. The ants will chow down and carry the poison back to their nests. In as little as 4 hours, you'll see fewer ants- But you may want to leave the baits for a week or so to make sure you catch the stragglers too.    Good luck!|`|sagjCRvKaa	I had an ant problem, and the neighbor told me to use cream of wheat. Just sprinkle it around the area they are at and they will eat it, and die. For some reason ants can't digest it and they dehydrate. It works you may have to use a lot, because it is a food source, but that is good because ants tell each other about food. You may have to sweep them up in a dust pan.  They also don't like the smell of lemon.
b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	Well it's hard to tell for sure but,  Doug fir posts and beams,  6" or 8" Cedar tongue and groove ceilings?  Pine, or possibly Spruce joists.  "Combed" Spruce fascia.  I couldn't see a picture of the decking.  And the roofing wasn't really a clear picture.  (this is a back-up computer and screen,  my good one is unavailable at the moment)  But if I had to hazard a guess,  I'd say composite shingles.  But don't quote me on that...    Edit-  I was looking at the wrong picture for the roofing.  I'm not sure what that roofing is composed of.  It has the same shape as a tin roof,  but I'm sure it's not that.  Where I live we don't use roofing like that.  Our winters aren't that harsh.  Maybe a slate roof?  But that would cost a fortune!  I really can't say for sure..sorry.    Also, a few things I noticed,  if I may:  I don't know if you're the one building this house but I would get wider pieces of combed Spruce for the fascia to cover the joist bottoms on the sides of the house to protect them;  keep them from getting wet;  or else you're going to have problems with dry-rot.  That is, if it IS combed Spruce.    And secondly,  I would continue the drip-edge around the corner and along the side of the house.  More protection from water.    Otherwise, from what I can see,  you've got a fine looking house there.  Nice lines,  very clean...    Type of house I wouldn't mind living in.     All the best..|`|VFmmVHGVaa	It looks like black spruce with green metal roof,one of the trees in the pic is spruce.  t|`|oyvRHQmaaa	The roof underlayment, and wood around the windows look to be yellow pine, or some form of pine..

XpkhUBkGaa	The hinge is attached to the door so the hinge leg will come out of the stove body. Normally it is easy enough to just lift up with the door partially open and then pull back. Its difficult to tell you how to do it other than as I described. Contrary to what Corkey says, it is not all that difficult once you see which type of glass package you have. Yours is a two glass system so it is quite easy to take it apart and clean it although you do need some mechanical skills. I have included the Whirlpool site for your oven which gives a pretty good blow up of the door assembly.     http://www.whirlpoolparts.ca/parts/fspSh...    I'm pretty certain that if you have some mechanical skills you will be able to disassemble, clean and reassemble the door.    Good luck and happy cleaning!|`|AA10097817	To clean your oven window, you will have to pull your oven door off of its hinge posts. You should consult the owner's manual that came with your oven to see if your oven's door is screwed into the hinge posts  or if it will simply pull off of the hinge posts. If there are screws, simply unscrew them and lift the door free.     ?Lay the oven door on newspapers or an old towel.     ?Look for the screws around the door's perimeter and remove them. This will separate your oven door into two halves. Be sure you label or mark which half is the front and which half is the back. This will save confusion when it comes time to reassemble the door.     ?Next, clean the glass panels with dish liquid and very warm water. If you have spots that are very tough to remove, you may want to use a nonabrasive cleaner on them.     ?When your glass is clean and dry, reassemble the door. Make sure all parts are placed back into their original position. Good luck!:)    Posted 1 year ago by (:?TayLee?:)|`|00153b0154f2f960c55490518a8803c3aa	I've had a few of these apart and they're NOT FUN.  If you do find screws holding the door onto the hinges, and remove them and the door comes off the hinges and you can get it apart, there's a very distinct possibility that the window is a sealed unit which you can't take apart anyway, which means you can't clean inside it.   And, once you've discovered this, it's a real bear to get the door all back together in the correct manner, with all the insulation in the right places, as well as the right screws in the right holes.  Sometimes things don't line up right and then the door doesn't want to close tightly.  I realize it can get unsightly, but believe me, it's not worth the trouble to try to clean the window in the oven door.
sw2R5A9iaa	if your ground is not frozen, plant outside and mulch well.|`|AA10097817	Most plants die from too much care rather than from benign neglect. Water this rose sparingly. Water till water comes out the bottom of the pot, let it stand for a few minutes, then pour off the excess. Do not water again till the soil feels dry to your second knuckle. Better that the plant should even wilt a little than to over water. Feed it once a month with an all-purpose fertilizer. Don't overfeed - we're going into winter when days are short and light levels low, so the plant will not be actively growing till spring. Give it all the sun you can; roses want full sun.    Yes, if it lives through the winter you can plant it outside in spring. Mini roses are hardy to Zone 5 but not 4. Good luck with y our rose!

6SzQKzYyaa	Try staging it as a library/den/office.  From the sketch provided it looks like it's tucked away, private.  This induces the idea of a quite area to study, read, escape.  Book cases filled with books, and unique treasures from travels (or garage sales!) will help create the feeling and mood of a room that people will want to have, and want to spend time in.     Some places allow you rent items for staging purposes so you don't have to spend a fortune on things you don't need.  Or if renting stuff isn't in the budget, maybe your family and friends have items you could borrow (rugs, lamps, etc.) to create a soothing, quiet space.      Try setting up a seating area with a small table and two chairs, a place to chat and catch up, include a couple of mugs and a basket with apples.  One of the corners would be a good spot, something almost tucked away, but so inviting that potential buyers sit down and just take a breath while enjoying the room.  The idea is to make this space really stand out, something that potential buyers will remember.  Play up this room as if it's a bonus, something so special that they won't remember anything but YOUR house!     The room leading to this could be staged family / game room.  Comfortable seating, lots of pillows and throws, board games on the coffee table.      However, if your Realtor insists on staging it as a bedroom (because people love bedrooms!), then by all means make it a bedroom.  Just be sure it's feel and mood matches that of the library/den/study.      Another option would be to create a nursery instead, but that's kind of appealing only to people with young children or people looking to start a family soon.  But, it's an option all the same.    Crafting has become very popular (scrap booking, card making, etc.) so another idea would be to create a craft room, but this may not appeal to a wide audience.    Whatever you choose, just be sure to pay attention to the details to really make the space stand out.  Good luck!|`|05bV2GuFaa	Since the room is long, so you can break up the space a little, set up with a desk and book case in there, and some sort of comfortable sitting like a lounge chair.

But since you are selling your house you probably don't want to buy a pool table. The dimensions are kind of tough to work with, but a nice office might work. A lot of people have a study or office connected to their bedroom. You could also just do a den or sitting room.

vEsSIGfYaa	I don't know what you mean by the last bottom branch.  Palms do not have branches, only leaves called "fronds,"     If that is what you are calling a branch, then I have to assume by the "last bottom" is that you are talking about the green living fronds, versus the dead, brown, or partially brown fronds.    As a Palm grows, the weight of the fronds cause them to droop, first outward, then downward.  During that time their weight tends to spread and loosen the top of the plant and relieve pressure on the new fronds growing out of the top.  This is necessary for the health and a long life for the plant.    A lot of people IMPROPERLY trim off ALL of the "non" green fronds. On a Palm which has been trimmed in this incorrect manner you will notice that as they grow taller, the trunk begins to taper smaller.  If this practice is done long enough, the plant will get smaller in diameter until the new growth will eventually be "choked" off.    Dead fronds should NOT be trimmed off until they have been hanging straight downward for at least a year!  Unsually in that time period there will be MORE than one level [or layer] of dead fronds hanging downward, but only the BOTTOM layer is truely fully downward.  These bottom fronds are the only ones that should be trimmed off.    I realize that a lot of folks think that the dead brown or grey fronds are ugly, but their presense is absolutely necessary to the health and longevity of the plant.

ozwLZwXeaa	Yes, check the breaker first.  If the cord is shorted out you need not buy a whole new dryer. You can buy a new cord.  Be sure that dryer is unplugged, now.

If it is the cord and it needs to be replaced get yourself a screwdriver and with that dryer unplugged and away from the wall, take the power cord off, take it with you to the electrical store and buy the exact same cord, exact  same  cord don't let them sell you anything else.

VUNTunxiaa	It is obvious that the answers you have received are from people that do not understand what that equipment grounding conductor does, how electrical grounding works, or what the National Electrical Code requires for equipment grounding.    If your house has a wiring system of Type NM Cable ("rope" or Romex - Romex is actually a brand name, like XEROX), and it is an older home, you may have an ungrounded system. If so, there is no point in bonding this green (other times bare copper) equipment grounding jumper to anything. There is no path for any fault current to run on, so it will simply be there, doing nothing.    If your house has a metal raceway system, or is wired with Type AC Cable (commonly called "BX", another brand name), you need only connect this wire (bond it) to the metallic box using either a GREEN 10-32 grounding screw, or a listed GREEN grounding clip. If the connections between raceway sections are tight, that is the fault current path back to your panel.    Simply connecting an equipment grounding conductor to a metal water pipe will not provide any type of protection. The Code clearly states that the earth shall not be used as a grounding path or conductor to clear faults; there is simply too much resistance.    Ground rods, Ufer Grounds, metallic water lines are used as "Earthing Paths", in the words of the newest Code (2008 NEC) simply as a means of attempting to disperse voltage spikes or surges caused by lightning or contact between your overhead service drop and a conductor of a higher voltage.    That is why the Code does not allow replacing 2-slot, ungrounded, receptacles with 3-slot, grounded receptacles, unless certain other conditions are met. Having the third hole, for the Grounding connection of an appliance cord is misleading. There is no way to provide an equipment ground, so the equipment may be damaged without the knowledge of the owner. It is safer to know that this equipment ground does not exist, than to rely on a ground path that does not exist.    I now yield the soap box to anyone who wishes to attempt to contradict me using anything they think they have found in the NEC.|`|yJ4M8VOnaa	In other words, in your case, don't worry about it.|`|jcauTPLZaa	Electrical inspector has it right. If you just hook the ground to the metal duct work, how is the ground fault going to find its way back to the panel?????????? It wont.

Oq5a5hRhaa	She won't need a special sewing machine (duvet covers usually aren't stitched onto the comforter, so you can remove them and wash them), but you may have problems finding fabric that is large enough.    Most fabric isn't sold any larger than 60" in width, that means that your mother will have to put individual pieces together to make the comforter cover. This can look good or bad, depending on how it is styled. If you choose to go this way, I would suggest doing the top of the bed in zebra and then doing the parts of the comforter cover that will drop down on the sides in black or white.    I wouldn't suggest buying a comforter cover premade unless you have purchased a down comforter, or found a cover that is made for an oversized down comforter. Down comforters are generally smaller than regular ones, and you probably won't be able to fit your regular comforter into a full sized duvet cover.    What you need to do is measure the length and width of your current comforter. If you can find a cover that you like that is equal to or slightly larger (within an inch or two) than the comforter you have, then you can use that cover.    If you can't (and I suspect you can't), then you can do one of two things. Find zebra sheets. Purchase two flat sheets in a size at least a couple inches larger than the comforter (it should have the exact measurements listed on the package)--too big is okay, too small is not. You may have to buy two sheet sets, as a lot of places do not sell flat sheets individually. Then your mother can sew them together, removing or hiding any extra fabric, giving you a comforter cover.    Your second option is to go to a fabric store and look for their extra-wide fabric. This is made in much larger widths than regular fabric (for projects like this), and you should be able to make a cover out of it. This is usually sold in yards. If your comforter is 85" long, you would need to purchase at least six yards of fabric to cover it. Make sure you have a bit extra, for seam allowance.|`|AA10104881	+++sure, just make it like a pillow case, no special sewing parts required

b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	There's many types of mold.  Most harmless.  Some harmful.  A few of them very harmful.  And one (that I know of) fatal.  This is the flesh-eating mold.   There are mold test kits you can purchase at your hardware store if you want to test it yourself.  I've always sent samples I've collected to labs as hazardous material.  If you do decide to test it yourself,  wear a good quality respirator and protective clothing.  Goggles are good too.  Not the ones with holes in them.  Thick latex gloves.  I wear old cover-alls and soak them in bleach afterward,  just in case.  And yes,  see about proper ventilation so it doesn't happen again.    BTW-   Of all the samples I've sent in,  none were of the harmful variety.|`|Fo9ADQLBaa	Bleach will kill the mold and mildew.  We had to do this when our washing machine overflowed.

Ventilation is a must as with air movement.  If the floor is just of earth, cover it with a 6mill black plastic, overlap & caulk any seams with silicon or anything sticky for that matter and seal it to the outside walls,    If concrete blocks are exposed on the outside walls, get some Styrofoam, cut, fit and seal.|`|MzHwklzKaa	Look in the phone directory for a mold specialist.  They'll come out and take samples and let you know if you have a dangerous type.  They'll also either give you an estimate for cleaning it up, or tell you what to do.    It's worth the money.  Trust me.    My friends are right in the middle of a mold induced night-mare.

9d9f34fe1144f6f0a8ddf5093f4fcdf7aa	Well, its not a quick fix but fill up the can with water and let it start dissolving.  I would recommend pouring out the resulting saline solution each day and replacing it with fresh water (it will dissolve the salt easier).  I wouldn't recommend throwing the can down (maybe light tapping).      Reality check - how much did the small galvanized garbage can cost? I'm guessing about $8.  Weigh the cost of a new one against the time you'll spend fooling with this and the cost of the water.|`|AA10097817	I don't think you're going to get it back to crystals without using a sledge hammer on it.

Anyway,  fire-resistant safes have a rating for resistance to heat.  They get the rating by field tests.  The higher the rating,  the more resistant it is.  And the more expensive.

The high heat would probably brown the photo paper and make the images indecipherable.  If these are pictures that you want to keep (heirlooms, etc), there are several routes to go:    1) If they are digital, save to CD's.  Store the CD's off site (safe deposit box, work, etc.).  You don't really gain the advantage over paper with CD's when it comes to being flame-resistant but they will last longer than paper.  2) If they are already on paper, scan to discs.  Then see  1  3)You can use online storage sites that are specifically set up for photos.  They are used for this exact situation.  Do a search for online photo storage.  You should be able to find something suitable.    Good luck.

pDKm9Wmgaa	Does it have holes in the bottom for drainage? If not, I would take the pot back and get one that does. If the pot doesn't have drainage holes, excess water will have nowhere to go and your plant's roots will rot. Rocks will do nothing to help drainage if the water has nowhere to go.|`|AA10520442	I'll assume the pot has drainage holes.  If you add rocks in the bottom of the pot it does not stop the water from draining through.  If you have the pot on a waterproof surface it's not a problem.  If you have it on your coffee table you're in trouble.     I've used those disposable aluminium baking pans under pots, old oddball dishes, the 29 cent plastic pot trays you can buy at Wal Mart.  If you can't find something to put under the pot just be sure you water it in a sink and let it drain for a awhile before you set it back on anything not waterproof.|`|dXrHoLMCaa	I've had pots with no holes (ceramics) that I wouldn't take a chance of drilling.... and I've loaded the bottom up with various stones, cans, whatever, as a place for the water to get away from the plant's roots.... it works, but at a terrible cost.... the SMELL!!!.... with no air, and no way to evaporate or drain, that water gets really raggy!!!....so drill holes, buy a saucer and don't make yourself go thru that mess!....|`|sw2R5A9iaa	just buy an  inexpensive pan at the local hardware store or garden shop.|`|59c3b42b981e8e7cddf9e38ed4ba42b6aa	If you are trying to know if you can use rocks or pebbles in replacements for the pan on the bottom of your pot, the answer is absolutely yes. Even shards of broken pots will do the trick. This of course assuming you have a hole in the bottom of your pot for drainage and air circulations. If no hole you can always drill one or more. I hope that satisfy your question. Good luck.|`|yuwjQjKqaa	You can buy a pan!|`|kYcRLr0Naa	If it's plastic you can make your own holes if you have a drill. I've done that before and it saves having to place rocks or gravel on the bottom of the pot. It's better too because it allows the water to drain so that fresh water can be added. It's even possible to drill holes in clay pots, but you have to be careful not to crack the pot when you do this
JkTIfXEmaa	Yes you can send the lamp but not oil.|`|9d9f34fe1144f6f0a8ddf5093f4fcdf7aa	You cannot send the oil.  It is flammable and must be marked as such.  Most likely the USPS will not even handle it.  You will probably have to send it via UPS or FedEx as flammable freight.    Also note, your lamp would probably not arrive in one piece.  Regardless of packaging, lamp glass is notoriously thin and would probably not make it through its first sort at the shipping facility.
9d9f34fe1144f6f0a8ddf5093f4fcdf7aa	The answer, "It depends."  I know, not a good answer but without a picture or more details, its hard to recommend a solution.      Is the table top wood or some other material (stone, granite, glass, etc.)?  If wood, is it stained and sealed?    Assuming it is wood, I think you're in for the long haul if you really want to restore it.  You probably will have to strip the table top, match the stain and coat with polyurethane.  Alternately, you can take it to a furniture repair shop for this work if you are not well versed in carpentry.  Again, I'm making this recommendation based on assumptions, not knowing the extent of the damage.|`|OFGipPETaa	Place a towel over the stained area and take an iron and rub over the area with high heat and steam.
iZ4JugiAaa	Termites live inside the wood.  You won't see them crawling on the wood.  They bore tunnels into the wood, and branch off from there into adjoining wood.  There can be thousands in one house infestation.  They don't just die off or move on until your house is falling down around your ears.    Don't bother with orange oil to combat termites.  You'd need to dab each termite individually, which would destroy your house as you dug through the timbers to get to the bugs.    Call an exterminator to tent your house and give it a proper treatment.|`|b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	It might not be termites.  It could be dry-rot; a case of rotting wood.  The only way you're going to see them is if you cut or drill into the wood and shine a flashlight in there.    Dry-rot looks a lot like termite damage.  Call a reputable exterminator because if it is termites,  they won't just die off or go away.  And the damage is just getting worse as I type this.  Better yet,  call a home inspector.  He won't go up in your attic for a few minutes and come down with a handful of termites that he brought with him in his pocket and say,  "I found these in your attic. We gotta tent the house."  I shouldn't say that really.  There are honest exterminators.  It's just that an inspector has nothing to gain by not telling you the truth.  All the best with whatever you decide.

As an alternative you can make your own:    Here is the recipe that I use:  -3 bars Fels Naptha Laundry Soap (or you can use Zote)  -2 C. Baking Soda  -2 C. Borax  -2 C.Washing Soda    Finely Grate the soap I used a hand grater at first then I started using my food processor. Mix all of the ingredients well in a big container...you can reuse your empty store bought detergent container if you choose.     I use 1/4 C. to a 1/2 C. per load depending on the size and how dirty the clothes are. Some people say you can use 2-4 Tbs. but I don't know if it was because I had hard water but it just didn't get my clothes clean.    You can also add oxiclean to your whites anywhere from 1/4 C. to 1/2 C. (not on silk or wool though) and use Between 1/4 C. to 1 C. Vinegar to rinse depending on the size of the load. The vinegar is a natural fabric softener and also gets off any residue that may be left behind from the soap. And NO your clothes wont smell like vinegar. If you are really worried you can still use your regular fabric softener just use half of what you would normally use.|`|n1D90COxaa	I prefer to use  ERA laundry soap  to get the tough stains out, but I also pretreat with Spray N wash or Shout, and add oxiclean(generic) , and bleach for colored clothes at the beginning of the wash cycle, and either ammonia or vinegar during the rinse cycle, ammonia makes your whites, white.....I wash in warm water always. and don't use the dryer, air dry if at all possible.

VFmmVHGVaa	I only buy sale items, its cheaper and you always have plenty on hand.Unless of course you would never use that much.  t|`|lBw50ySpaa	Have a pizza party, and eat before you go shopping next time.|`|kYcRLr0Naa	I've never had that problem. You just have to think about what your needs are and not what the store is offering- especially if it's a food item that's perishable. I mean, if they said they're having a sale on frozen turkeys and you don't have a large freezer would you buy 6 of them if that was the limit? Common sense tells you that you don't need 6 frozen turkeys unless you're having a party or other feast where a lot of people will be eating those turkeys. It only makes sense if it's an item that you can keep for months such as cake mixes or other dry goods. The same goes for clothing or shoes- would you buy six pairs of shoes if that's the limit the store offers? Of course not- unless your one of those women who keeps 100 pairs of shoes of all colors and style around just for those "special occasions" That's what the stores are hoping for, but you don't have to fall for it.|`|ebJ02QZJaa	If it's "limit 6," then I don't necessarily buy 6.  But, if it's Buy 2/Get 2 Free, then I'll buy 2 (get 4) .  I mean, why buy 1 and only get 1 when you can buy 2 and get 4.  It's just so I can max out the freebies.   If the sale is 3/$10 or $4.50 each, then I'll buy 3 to get the cheaper per piece price.  But, if it's just a "limit" thing, I don't try to reach the limit.      Most grocery stores rotate the same sales over and over on a 6 week schedule.  So, what is on sale now will be on sale again in 6 weeks.      You can freeze cheese, so don't worry that you've got to have mac and cheese and cheese toast every day for the next 2 months.

Deciduous trees lose their leaves, but many of the trees are evergreens anyway, and lawns and many shrubs stay green. Garden plants die off, mostly, or lose most of their leaves. But if you came from the northeast anytime between November and late March, you'd really notice the green.|`|YMwUpBIAaa	most of washingtion state gets cold and even snowy at times. the northwest is known for the best gardening in the united states, but still trees go dormat their as the do in the northeast. their are quite a few plants in washingtion especially along its coast that do bloom and stay green, but the brow plants outnumber those.    their are quite a few shrubs though that do stay green all year, but its according to the place in washingtion.|`|l0NRdN3Faa	I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts, twiddly dee, there they are a standing in a row.|`|BcSZ4Jidaa	In alot of places in washington it stays green for most of the year, just depends on the type of trees and stuff. it snows, but not very often, and in the fall the trees may not be green, cause they may not have leaves on them.|`|DKJ8sjxVaa	You're reading Twilight, aren't you!?    
DktmTd62aa	I think it depends on what service you go with.  We used to have our living room carpet and 2 couches cleaned for $90.  We lived in an apt. at the time so we just asked the landlord who she used to clean carpets after people moved out.  You'll probably just have to call around and see what some prices are.|`|l8yfpyy1aa	Your best bet would be to call up the carpet and upholstery cleaning people in your area and get estimates.

J6pMMzVfaa	L x W x H .   Now convert to cubic Yards.  Don't forget you need to know if the web of the cinder block is a full web or half web.  I assume it is a half web since its intended to be filled with concrete.  So multiply the result by  0.75, for full web 0.7.  Don't forget its better to send back a half yard of concrete. Than pay full minimum charges for another truck, let alone the extra time involved while the mud sets up. Oh yeh, almost forgot use a large slump factor like 3 inches so the concrete flows easy down into all the areas for good coverage and help it with an extra rebar to flow by poking up and down a little..|`|Rh2th9zqaa	Call a concrete contractor.

There are 46,656 cubic inches in a cubic yard. 46,656 divided by 624 is right around 74. So one cubic yard of concrete will fill 74 block.    When ordering concrete, always order too much. Order 2 1/2 or 3 yards. the measurement in the truck is never accurate and the concrete company will always say you mis calculated.

tv76ztD5aa	Dress it with a good fabric, add throw pillows and presto you'll have your furniture good as new. Being practical is the best move nowadays.|`|Vzf0Zp9Saa	Find a nice cloth or fabric to cover the top of the piece you like the least.|`|VvsYmxhBaa	If you can afford some nice fabric that would be the best and make matching table cloths for them, if not try some twin size flat sheets that can usually be pretty cheap when sold separately at large stores like Walmart. If you just want to cover the top and side edges, one twin cut down the middle would cover both easily and hide the fact that they are mismatched and still be functional. The other option is to place the dresser inside a closet out of sight, if the closet is big enough.   Hope this at least gives you some ideas.   Good luck!|`|6SzQKzYyaa	Sounds like you don't care for the dresser, can you put it in a closet?  That way you can still easily access the drawers, but won't have to look at it.      If that's not practical (cause a girl needs all the closet space she can get!) you can hide the dresser behind a tri-fold screen, or behind a curtain hung from the ceiling with cup hooks.      The cup hooks would create tiny little holes, but they shouldn't cause any damage and are hardly even noticeable when removed. Just be sure the material you hang from it isn't heavy and use enough hooks to securely hold the material.     Cup hooks (found in the kitchen gadget aisle in grocery stores, or in the hardware section Wal-Mart, Target, etc.) are usually white just as most ceilings are.        Below are links to help illustrate your options.  The tri-fold screen would probably be the easiest.  Good luck, I hope this helps.|`|9d9f34fe1144f6f0a8ddf5093f4fcdf7aa	Buy some fabric, cut out patterns you like and attach with LOW tack two-sided tape.

(san antonio tx)|`|03sLrNPCaa	You can plant them in the house four or five weeks before the last frost date, and set the pots outside on sunny days to harden them.  But do it gradually, an hour or so the first day and increasing the time each day.  Don't put them in the ground until the soil has warmed up to sixty degrees or so.  By setting them out too soon you take a chance on freezing them, and even a slight frost will kill them.  Even if they don't freeze they will just sit there without growing, and possibly be stunted if the soil is too cold.|`|AA10753451	Early April is a safe planting date.

459JmuSxaa	Yes, raccoons are color blind and they can't see red. They see green light very well though. Raccoons are nocturnal, meaning their eyes are very sensitive to light and they can see quite well in the dark. Its like having night vision goggles. Their eyes take any available light and amplify it. If you are going to have any type of light on, doesn't matter what color, they are going to see it very brightly.   Here is a site with some good ideas on getting rid of the pests. You may have to invest in a humane trap or possibly hire someone to get the job done.  http://www.getridofthings.com/getridofra...
9d9f34fe1144f6f0a8ddf5093f4fcdf7aa	This is really a two part answer.    First - regardless of the weather conditions, you need to determine where the leak is originating.  If you can find it (flashing is my guess), put something up to redirect the water (board, tarp, etc.).  This will prevent further damage and allow the wood to dry out before repair.    Second - It depends on whether or not the ceiling is finished with drywall or open.  If it is open, it is more likely that the wood will simply dry out.  When the rain stops, repair the roof.  If you have drywall, it is now damaged and will probably have to be replaced.  Either way, repair the leak first before moving on to the internal repairs.  If you have drywall, remove the damaged section, and look for mold on the studs.  If you have some, let the wood dry, paint it with KILZ (get it from Depot or Lowe's) and replace the drywall.|`|a9HSVexoaa	I think the leaky roof need to be exposed to sun light to get dried that is why we avoid repairs in rainy season. to get dry there are two important factor      how long it will be exposed to sunlight. (more gives earlier results)  how long it will be exposed to rainy water. (less will give earlier results.)|`|Rh2th9zqaa	On the next dry day roof it or have it roofed. Eventually it will rot the rafters.And, yes do consider the mold...|`|YY24gmRpaa	I do not know what it will cost to fix your roof, however a $5,000 job now will likely become closer to $10,000 in a month or so and maybe two or three times that much later on.   How long to wait really depends on how much you want to spend on repairs.   Most sane people would at least have it patched immediately and permanently repaired as soon as possible.  The longer you wait the more wood beams, insulation, sheetrock, flooring, etc will have to be replaced.  The mold and mildew will love you if you wait, it's not often they get a chance to take over a whole house.|`|hWdSTmfDaa	it depends on how much mold you want.

vl6OtBfWaa	Residential Contractor Montreal Canada    The type of estimate you are asking for is hard to give with so little detail but copper is very expensive wire and pipe labor also is expensive.    You are looking at a job that would require quite a bit of demolition and more than likely if your house is that old you might need to re-do both utility entrances.  What I mean is to actually run a new higher amperage service line from the electric pole outside to your new breaker panel then change every switch outlet and wire in the house walls need to be opened in a lot of cases and new oulets switches and lighting added    Then you have your water supply and sewage lines these might also need changing because of modern building standards and the need to remove steel lead or cast iron pipes.  Also the new demands of your new supply system might need a larger feed from the mun icipal water supply.    Very hard to figure these things blind    But I think with some research of good contractors and some shopping around for cost effec tive fixtures you could easily keep it under 40,000  probably quite a bit under 40.    Find as many contractors as you can in both trades and get free estimates.    Now this is the most important thing you can do to get accurate estimates and prices make an accurate list of what you want the job to include re-do the list 100 times if you need to but when you give THE SAME LIST TO ALL CONTRACTORS 1 for elec 1 for plumb do not change things later or during work.    If you tell 3 plumbers to "change my pipes give me a price " you will never have an accurate way of gauging who is the best contractor and best price    Be specific number of lights switches and outlets gauge of wire number of breakers amperage and how many high tech devices that need gfi circuits.    Research now prep now and you will be much happier later.|`|c93ea3c8cf1c3dd9a0e3b461289096d9aa	A lot depends on the style of the house and how it was constructed. The plumbing cost depends on how many bathrooms you have and how much of the piping is in the walls vs in the crawlspace. Tearing out walls and floors ups the cost. Same goes for the wiring. We had our 1920 house partially rewired; new circuits added and the wiring in the attic replaced, but left the old wiring in the walls and crawlspace as it would be harder to get to and it was functioning fine and not likely to be disturbed. I think if you shopped around for prices and were willing to do some of the unskilled work yourself, you could do it for far less than $40,000. Also, you could sell some of that acreage to raise money for the upgrades, too.|`|AA10725997	Without seeing the house and the scope of the work it is hard to say. However I think the figure of 40,000 is more than enough.    I would guess it at 25k or less sight unseen.    Times are tight for tradesmen right now there should be a large pool of competent contractors in your area that would love to get the job.    I would get multiple bids.    Three from General Contractors supervising both crews.    A separate three from Electrical and Plumbing contractors respectively.    Make sure each is licensed bonded and insured. Ask for references that are local and you can verify work. Make sure permits are pulled.    Compare each bid carefully. The lowest bid is not always the best bid use friends family and neighbors for advice if you are uncomfortable.    Do not get a handyman for work of this scope.    This is a big job and you can gain a huge education just from the bidding process. Ask questions of how long and what method will be used for the work performed      From your description I would say do what you have to to keep the house. You seem to love it as much as Dad. But don't kill yourself if you can't. Do your best and if makes more sense to leave do so but the market is not on your side right now.
vigFmfLmaa	Buy a rug with both colors.  Get some accessories that are the orange color you want - like vases, photo frames, pottery, etc.  Even books with orange and brown hues in the jacket art would be a nice subtle touch.  I would vary the shades of orange and even add at least one other color; you don't want things to be too matchy matchy.  Pick up some pieces of artwork to break up the vast white walls.  Drapery panels with thick horizontal stripes of brown suede and orange silk/satin would be cool, assuming you have enough artwork on the wall.

J7VPM23Xaa	The other two answerers are right, there's nothing you can do about the discoloration other than replating the racks.  Don't worry about it, just keep your oven door closed.|`|l8yfpyy1aa	I'm afraid that the extreme heat has permanently changed the finish on your oven racks.  They might not be chrome -- they might be a stainless steel alloy.  I have seen stainless steel saucepans turn blue-ish brown in places, after they got overheated when empty.     Check with the store where you bought your stove.  They might have a suggestion, or perhaps the warranty will cover replacing the racks.    If nothing can be done, your choice would be to buy new racks or to live with the discolored ones.  I wouldn't buy new ones, myself.  Oven racks often lose their shine over time anyway.|`|iWM3zqwUaa	try sos pads first before tossing out|`|24cde8bf3f4cbca12a1379054950f95aaa	sorry but no you can't once chrome is exposed to extreme heat it chemically changes composition. if you feel its worth it you can have them plated again with a new chrome finish.(i had them done at an auto body/paint shop)
AdnfOD4Zaa	Tiles can be repainted but should only be done by professional re-glazing contractors. These contractors will sand the surfaces,acid etch, prime and then spray the tiles with a 2 part epoxy paint. The room will be sealed off to prevent fumes from entering other areas of the house. Room air will be exhausted to the outdoors during the process. I have used sub contractors for this process dozens of times with great success as long as all these steps are taken. Many shoddy contractors will try to leave out steps like sanding or priming. Most will offer warranties of 5,10 or 20 years. Prices are dependent on square feet ,tile size, ease of access. The process takes 2-3 days if done correctly. Wall tiles will hold up much longer than floor tiles using this process. Thats why I like the longer warranties if painting the floor.|`|dPULl5hjaa	There's a special paint.  Call your local paint store.      Maybe go on DIY or HGTV websites and post your question.|`|07402bcc6087c522e1be5f950a5e9ba8aa	Paint on tiles never lasts very well.

Best to retain the existing tiles and have estimates to tile over them.
YY24gmRpaa	Kind of like asking how high is up.  Without a lot more detail there is really no way to estimate your cost.  You may be able to get a ball park figure by finding a finished house in your area  that has sold recently and subtracting what you will be paying from what the finished house sold for.

Depending on your geographic area, many new homes are built for $65-$70 per square foot of living space.  These homes are typically sold for $90-$100 per square foot.  The people that typically build their own home will do some of the work themselves and/or act as the General Contractor.  Both of these will lower your overall cost.  But the basic reason it saves you money is that there is no mark-up.  A home builder is a business man.  He builds the house at cost and then adds his mark-up for profit.  I have heard some builders charge as much as 30% or more.      No one can really give you an accurate answer on time to build a house because you haven't given enough details.  It would be better to know square footage, number of garages, height of ceilings, exterior cladding (brick? siding?), interior finishes (granite? crown moulding?).  But just spitballing, you could probably have that house built in 3 months assuming you already had the land, you already had the plans, you start in the spring or summer, and you can readily get permits in your area.|`|J6pMMzVfaa	In todays market and during the next two years at least.  It will be cheaper to buy one.  My advise is to wait as long as you can.

BUPiXrxVaa	If you have a regular deep well submersible pump, there is a piece called a pitless adapter, usually welded to the well casing, sometimes connected to the well casing by compression fittings. The pitless adapter, is what connects the two pipes. The main pipe to the pump has a fitting on it that just slides into the fitting on the horizontal pipe. This fitting is visible, by looking down the well casing. It should be about 18 to 24" down on the side where the horizontal pipe enters the well casing.    The top of the pitless adapter has a 1" threaded hole in it. You can buy a tool or rent one, or you can make one by using a piece of 1" threaded pipe, a T adapter and two shorter 1" threaded pipes. You make your T pipe by using 1 piece of pipe about 30" long, the T adapter and 2 pieces of pipe about 12" long. The handle(the 12" pieces) has to be wide enough that it will not go down the well casing.    You simply screw the long piece of pipe into the pitless adapter and pull up. Now you will have the weight of the pump, the vertical pipe and the pump wire, so if you don't think you are strong enough get help. The T handle you made will stop the pump from falling to the bottom of the well if you drop it.    Below are two links. The first one is pictures of pitless adapters. The second explains there use a little bit.|`|VFmmVHGVaa	need to know what kind of well and kind of pipe  t|`|9d9f34fe1144f6f0a8ddf5093f4fcdf7aa	Pipe Wrench and Channelocks.
WqkOI7RDaa	Other than re-working your vents, there's not much you can do.  As long as no one in the house is smoking, it shouldn't be much of a problem.   We used to have a lady under us who cooked the most delicious food. Only problem it ever really caused was making us wake up hungry. (She woke up at 7, us at 8)|`|vEsSIGfYaa	There could be one of several causes for this issue, or even a combination of more than one.    Here is what I suspect:    1.  Being a "new" house it is probably VERY "tight," i.e. very little exchange of inside air with outside air, and thus a continuing build-up of all kinds of odors [cooking, pets, human body odors, etc.].      2.  The central air system circulates these throughout the house.    3.  The "high quality kitchen fan," by which I suspect you mean a stove vent hood is ALMOST USELESS in an airtight, or almost airtight, house.  It CANNOT pump out odors in the air once a small amount has been exhausted to the outside, and the pressure in the house is lowered to a point the fan can pump out no more.      In commercial cooking environment [restaurants, cafes, etc.] the high volume cooking hoods are required by code to have volumetric equally sized "make-up" air systems which take in outside air to replace the volume of air being exhausted by the hood vent.      These systems are required to be designed so as to screen or filter out insects, dust, etc.  They discharge the make-up air at or around the perimeter of the cooking vent hood so as to reduce the amount of "conditioned" air sucked in from throuout the structure.    What these systems do is to take in "outside" air in a volume equal to or slightly greater than the amount of air the cooking hood discharges.  Thus the cooking vapors rising from the cooking equipment are all discharged outside the house while that air is simultaneously replaced with air from outside.    Weather conditions permitting YOU CAN TEST THIS THEORY by temporarily opening a kitchen window or door close to the vent hood while both cooking and having the house air conditioning system in operation.    During this process, scout through the house to see if the odors are being distributed, or are being properly discharged by the vent hood.    If the cooking odors do not get circulated throuout the house, then a lack of make-up air is the problem and points the way to the solution.    IF the cooking odors persist, then there is the possibility that the ducting from the vent hood is NOT properly routed to the outside of the house, i.e., circulating air throuout the entire house.  This requires the "proper" installation of the hood vent duct to the outside air.    If you decide to install a make-up air system, be sure to NOT locate the air INTAKE too close to the vent hood duct DISCHARGE!!!!!|`|htDt7l3Taa	You might try useing a better filter in your return air.  The pleated ones are good. Or you can get the washable ones from a hardware store that block particulates and such. They are like 50 bucks though. Thats about all you can do other than reworking your ductwork. Hope i helped

xX5Sg3Niaa	If you paint it the same color it will make your space seem larger than if you were to separate it with molding and paint it two different colors. Painting them two different colors would work if the space was huge and you wanted to make them more intimate, but otherwise I'd stick with the same color and use different complimenting accent colors in each room. It will also help with the flow of the house if you keep the wall the same color the same color.     I would not use any partitions in between the kitchen and family room because usually these are places that you entertain and spend time with friends and family so they should be as open as possible.|`|9G03aQhsaa	Molding would give you a separation of space, thus allowing you to paint the two rooms different colors--they need to coordinate though.   If you opt to go without the molding the walls should be the same color.    Also, if you have a couch and it is practical within your layout to move it so it is at the boundary of the two rooms (seating part facing the family room of course) that would also add to the feeling of two separate spaces.  You could also separate the two rooms with a light weight sliding partition hung from a cord stretched across the two walls.|`|de37ff60ad870615960b25c1d9aca838aa	If you want the space to look smaller, then separate.

Yes, I know Rainsoft is stainless steel and they give you their spiel to go with it.  Blah, blah, blah.  But, they are not worth the price.  I paid $2000 for mine.

AA11452178	It really depends where you live.  Most people that have gone to college have learned the 2 x method or the 3 x labor.  The 3x is used in markets where there is not much competition.  In Georgia where I am at I would bel lucky and happy to get a cliente with the 2 x method.  Keep in mind I have gone to college, have 1,000,000 liability where a lot of guys get some equipment, say there a professional, get a business license, and there off.  Ask who ever you hire what kind of training do they have.  The 3 times method is labor, and material, x 3 = quote. The 2 x method is basically the same with a little extra calculated in for the "what if's". You can save yourself a bundle by buying the materials first and haggle with your local suppliers. Sometimes nurderies will beat out the big chain stores, and sometimes the nurseries cost more but the product is better and healthier.|`|97c85152f11a0d5fc10e96acbf5bcd2aaa	where do u live? if in Canada, Saskatchewan......let me know at ggazda@sasktel.net
