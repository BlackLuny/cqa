20090304223732AAVmOtY	Dining Out;Other - Dining Out	To the user: [[HA! You Wish!]]?	Your comment about the 15% tip really urked me in your answer under the 'please answer me this' post. You said you work, go to college, AND raise kids so you don't have to be a server? What makes you think you're better than me? I am in college, graduating this June, so I don't have to serve and bartend forever. Get off your high horse...you should've gone to college and finished BEFORE you started to have kids.      And by the way- serving and bartending is a GREAT way to make GREAT money. It's cheap welfare Mother's like you that make our jobs hard, and the tips sh*tty because you can't afford to go out. You can take your bad attitude and bratty kids to McDonalds if you aren't going to tip appropriately. And it was stated 20% is the norm...not 25%. I see that night school at the local community college is really educating you well!
