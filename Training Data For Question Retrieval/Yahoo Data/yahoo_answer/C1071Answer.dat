AA11966880	yeah the cross country will help you with running since you need to be able to run up and down the feild a lot, so try running but by dribbling the ball from one foot to another. make sure you don't kick the ball out too far when you dribble, because in a real game another player could grab it from you. also practice passing, you could just use a family member and tell them to run like with you on the side and pass it back and fourth to learn to control it, or practice aiming by kicking it to like any random thing it just takes practice. just make sure whenever you pass you need to use the inner side of your foot. soccer is really fun it doesn't hurt to just try. hope the helps|`|274adf172073dd1c3b811bb374ea8bd0aa	You'll never know if you dont try it.

AA10117764	Money can't buy everything; certainly NOT the priority of budding and established players in Europe-Latin America whose love and passion for the game is "numero uno" in their hearts and minds. To them playing for a Manchester United, or a Barcelona is beyond any price.    The US do not have a football culture, the professional clubs are virtually unknown entities outside America; and the football climate is generally lethargic at soccer games.    MLS is only for fading stars of the soccer world to glimmer occasionally and yet earn megabucks. This has always been the think.|`|428af0611017082721b89716252c273aaa	MLS is only for fading stars of the soccer world to glimmer occasionally and yet earn megabucks.

Boring football, I fell asleep watching Dynamo Houston - New England Revolution last year MLS Cup Final or whatever it was.|`|AA10348563	I heard a commentary somewhere (I can't remember where, but maybe during the World Cup this summer or the MLS Cup) that said one of the big problems with the MLS and soccer in the USA in general is the age and experience of the players when they finally do become professionals.    First of all, soccer isn't played everywhere and every American kid doesn't grow up playing it as children do in most parts of the world.  Therefore, you have a smaller pool of athletes to begin with.  Then, when you look at South America and Europe (I'm assuming Asia, to some extent, as well), the most promising players are immediately put into a youth system or academy that is often times run by the professional teams so that there is intensive training beginning at age 8 or 10.  Nothing of that magnitude exists in America.  Then, the best of the youth league players around the world become reserves and finally senior team members so that from the age of 14 or 15 they are training and competing against some of the best professional players in the world.  In the US, those kids are playing against one another in Jr. High and High school, with very few exceptions on All-Star or National Development teams.  Still, the American kids are only playing against each other, for the most part.  Then, at age 18 or 19, the international players are breaking into the top professional clubs and making senior team National debuts.  The American kids are playing in the NCAA, really the only large-scale developmental system for the MLS. Then, finally, at the age of 23 or 24 the American players break into the professional ranks and National teams and they are 5 years older and several levels of experience below the other players in the world.    Without a comparable development system that allows younger players to compete on the level that young players around the world are getting, there is no way that the MLS can breed players of the same quality as other leagues in the world.  The league will have to buy aging stars, but that still won't bring it up to the level of Serie A, La Liga, or EPL because those players coming in are no longer at the top of their games in the eyes of the European and World footballing community.

Z7txaHgBaa	Florida and OSU aren't developing a rivalry.  Yea, they played each other twice in bball, once in the title, and played each other in the BCS championship game.  However, rivalries are very hard to form in college, unless they are in state, such as U of M and MSU, or if the two coaches know each other and the teams are both successful every year, such as U of M and OSU.  Players only stay at college for 4 years at most.  I'd say Florida and OSU could have started developing a rivalry, but it won't happen.  Here's why.  Florida's bball team is losing Jokim Noah, Corey Brewer, and Torean Green, their best players.  OSU might lose Greg Oden.  In football, Florida has lost Chris Leak, the QB, and OSU has lost Troy Smith, their QB, and Ted Ginn Jr.  By next season, nothing will be left of this so called "rivalry".  If those guys came back, next year would be a rivalry, but it won't happen now.|`|7497f7be7e0fda7dd55a633c697f0d23aa	no way man... florida has too many other rivalries, FSU, Tennessee, Miami(FL)...    Not really. They won't play each other very often because they are non-conference opponents... I think that they probably won't play again for several years. Just a major coincidence.|`|8s9q4V03aa	????????????????????????????????????????...    that rivalry must of been like 70 years ago cuz i don't 'memba florida vs f state|`|4e0cff44f8de7eaf5e5a9aa4fc80bd68aa	No way, its just not possible, most of your rivalries are from so long ago that you couldn't remember why.  Like why are Notre Dame and USC Rivals?  Excatly, and come to think of it that is one of the few Rivalries that isn't geographical, other than the Armed Forces Accademies, most rivalries happen in state or just accross state lines, so don't read any more into things than need be, it just so happened that things worked out and they played twice, a true rivalry is when people wont marry people cause of affiliations with schools.  Neighbors being in wars!!!!!   Want a Rivalry look at Duke North Carolina,   two excellent programs with all the respect in the world for each other, true sportsmanship all around, but True hate for each other.  Thats like saying Ohio State and Akron, who is Akron!!! No not even possible.|`|6RuJuHAhaa	Not even close.  For one thing, the Gators don't harbor any bad feelings towards OSU.  I am sure that can't be said the other way around though.  They don't play often enough for a huge rivalry to develop.  For the second part of that question, no other rivalry will be a Florida/FSU.  I don't care what sport it is (or any other way of competing), those two schools hate each other.  From a strictly basketball standpoint, UF/Kentucky is the big rivalry.  Factor in everything else and FSU may not have a decent bball team, but that doesn't make the bball rivalry any less significant as was suggested in an earlier post.   By the way, I went to the school with superior academics, entrance standards, football, basketball, most other sports, class, sportsmanship, etc.  That would not be the one that moans for two to three straight hours during football games.  I would moan too if my team stunk and the whole nation made fun of it's criminal reputation.|`|AA10895833	florida and fsu isn't a "HUGE rivalry", you want a real rivalry look at osu vs. Michigan!  Florida is a one and done team.  They are good only one or two times in 20 years!  So  lets look at this  1. FSU vs. Florida isn't a HUGE rivalry  2.OSU vs. Florida will never be a  rivalry  3. Florida will not beat OSU every time  4. Florida Sucks  Any Quesions?|`|WzeAFmRfaa	yep|`|jaBOvIP7aa	Florida/FSU has never been a basketball rivalry. Football yes, basketball no. OSU and UF won't be a very big rivalry as they don't play each other very often. With the scheduling becoming more and more about playing big name schools (Kansas/Florida, UNC/UK, etc) during the regular season, it is still only one game, and usually during the early part of the year. Look back at the OSU/UF game back in December. OSU was hardly ready to compete with UF, and got rolled by 26. When you schedule top teams that early, it doesn't equate to what the game would play out like should it be played in March. OSU/UF will never be even close to the rivalry that UK/UF has developed into.  Unless of course, you're speaking of football.
pxXfNbXQaa	well i play travel softball and my coaches allways tell me to slide on the out side of the bag so ur less likely to be tagged and when u slide ur legs should be in the shaper of the letter 4  and that will help u not to sprain ur ankel..            ok i play center feild and second base so in the outfeild u want to stand like ur ready to catch a pop fly like u want to stand side ways with ur feet apart so if u get a ball over ur head you can start runng by criss crossing ur feet in sted of back peppiling. keep in mind im only 12 so ur coach might think diffrent but thats what my coaches tell me.                hope this helps.|`|8lLkklX3aa	Hi Alex,    I coach lots of softball teams and one of my favorite softball sliding drills can be done on any gym floor (or even on hardwoord if you have space at home).  This one is good because you will get the FEEL of sliding and won't become fearful of the movement.    Take your shoes off (you only need socks on for this).  Start in a push-up position and bring both feet forard through your arms.  Bring one knee up in the motion so that the side of your foot is under the other knee.  When your back-side gets through your arms, bring your arms up by your ears and tuck your head in.  Try to do the movement faster and faster and you will get the "feel" of sliding.      There is another sliding drill I posted on my blog that you might find helpful also:    http://www.softball-spot.com/softball-sl...    Hope that helps!    Good luck this season,  Becky

That way you can see if you like wrestling and it would give you some of the basic wrestling moves.|`|c6wywezQaa	Go 2 Nearest hospital|`|qr4oSSrPaa	First of all i must say its a very tough business. Now if your only getting into for the money then you won't last. Considering your only 12 sweety this might be a spare of the moment thing because you watch wwe. I think you should wait afew years and see if you still have the disire to wrestle.

M65Lu1GFaa	Sizemore and Howard of course. Sizemore goes in 1st round, Howard is the MVP. Soriano is good but he's struggling. Size and How have the ups.|`|ZcHfPmpzaa	Pretty even deal.  It depends on your team needs, and if you're a Cubs fan.  More power on the Howard/Sizemore side.  Better pitching with C. Young.|`|q9v26B6Vaa	I think at this point, the Howard side is the better bet. Howard is equal to, if not better, than D. Lee.  Sizemore is on fire and always remains solid.  Soriano is great but he's in a slump this year and we're all starting to wonder if he's going to break out. Not to mention, he's certainly not stealing bases like he normally does either.  Wang is not my favorite pitcher and I'm still a little leery about him but he's been solid as of late and on a team that gives him good run support. Young is fantastic but if you add up all the factors, I think you have to say the Howard side of this trade.|`|sogKQeFUaa	i think overall the person who would get Howard sizemore and wang is getting the better deal but i dont know wat kind of players that you need. I think just reject it if you dont know. I would accept to get howard but decline for soriano. Do w/e you want though|`|RTGMZgO1aa	If you have Howard, Sizemore, and Wang you better not trade.  Ryan Howard is on fire hit 5 HR in his last 10 games. Wang is 7-4 and had 10K his last time on the mound. Sizemore is due to break out just like at the begining of the season. it is a crappy trade because D. Lee is out 5 Games as well as C. Young. if  you could get Soriano though that help your team alot . the person who gets more up side is the person who recives Howard, Sizemore, and Wang.|`|6PZ2DppMaa	Sizemore, Howard and Wang for sure. D. Lee might seriously be done hitting for power, and without that, he is just a trumped-up version of Todd Helton. Soriano is obviously great, but you'd be trading for the name alone this year, as he hasn't done much to get excited about. Young is very good, but when i look at the other side of the deal and see three sure-fire fantasy stars, i just can't justify it.
AA12386014	August 7th vs the Nationals  August 13th vs Pirates      Just for fun! =) Though honestly I'll be like "whatever" when he does.|`|PLjFY8Fpaa	My guess is sometime before he is called back to hell.  He sold his soul.  I don't care for that lot.|`|AA11509922	The Giants do not play at home until August 6 against the Nationals, They play the Dodgers and Padres away until that time. I would think he would hit it at home because they accept him there. But i will be at the Dodgers- Giants game on Tuesday and i will be seating in the outfield so it would be cool to see it happen there and maybe even catch it.|`|FEzsy6tdaa	never hes gonna have a terrible injury and have to habg up his cleats for good. Its only a matter of time.|`|USh9kgOfaa	First of all, for all of u who are against Barry for steroids, or being a dick to the media, or wtvr. What do u have against Barry? Has he hurt any of u personally. I live in the Bay area and he is a king around here. Im sure if he had signed with the Yankees, New York would love him, the Mariners, etc. THe obvious stat for u ney sayers is this, over 75% of baseball players caught on steroids are pitchers. Barry Bonds has one of the purest swings in all of baseball.   FOr when he hits it, it will definetly be at home (for his and managments sake), and will be between the 7th and 9th inning. It will also be late August at his 5.23 at bats before HR average. Peace.|`|IhOvgpsfaa	who gives a s h i t

El7C2JsMaa	although i didn't get to see the game tonight, i have to agree with you about him, he is extremely underrated in my book, i've always rated him highly, reminds me of Makelele in the sense that he goes unnoticed during the match because he is doing all the ugly work that keeps the midfield running.<br>  <br>  There are not many players in the world who are better than him in that position!|`|D7Dubtt9aa	He is a decent little player the ones who don't stand out are normally the best he just gets on with his job class act.<br>  <br>  You don't get to captain argentina unless you are a very good player|`|HNmO2ZwXaa	If he sorts his passing out and the right manager comes in then he has the potential to be the best!!|`|XU1KaWXwaa	best tackler in the world :) and he likes hunting brazilians.|`|jKvxXKYKaa	I think Mascherano is great, he's a brilliant player and is in my opinion underrated. I love watching him tackle. But I had to take him out of my dream team this year cos he lost me too many points due to yellow cards!<br>  <br>  And to the person who said Skrtel is the best defender, he's not, Jamie Carragher is, he's the next best though.|`|EYElOumLaa	I'm a big fan of Mascherano. But to be honest to make him the complete midfielder he needs to learn to do two things, Pass and Shoot.<br>  Yes he is a collosus on the pitch, the best tackler in the premiership and along with Sissoko the best tackler in Europe. He's a tad better than Sissoko because he can give short passes and covers twice as much ground, but take of the Liverpool blinkers and do your duty for our great team, does he shoot like Gerrard or pass like Alonso.<br>  The one & only player I would like to cover our defense before Mascherano would have to be Marco Senna (Now he is pure class).<br>  <br>  P.S. Tonight was the best I have seen Carragher play for a long time.............and when is Martin Skrtel ever going to get the credit for being the best defender at Liverpool?|`|JuhBsN76aa	Masherano isn't underrated, hes a class act.  <br>  <br>  Maybe less flair than Sex, i mean Cesc Fabregas...but hes a good player.<br>  <br>  <br>  Argentina look strong candidates for world cup 2010. Tevez, Masherano, Messi etc|`|d1f4428d3bd66886014cedd35e30d605aa	is shite<br>  <br>  he is an Argentinean  gypsy bar steward<br>  <br>  He is forever cheating and he wouldn't do anything against Scholes or Rooney because they'd kick him off the pitch!|`|SsdRuG00aa	he is one of the greatest holding midfielders and he showed it today. and yes he is very underrated|`|58HL86ATaa	great player ,i wish he'd stop back chatting the ref's so often those yellow cards add up and rafa doesn't need much of an excuse to play the legend that is Lucas|`|SG5vRFWjaa	he's pretty average to be honest.|`|Pfq2zRejaa	he is pure class strong an hardly ever puts a foot wrong|`|nJ5kceMBaa	Amazing performance. He must have put in at least 20 sliding tackles, and almost every time he recovered and had the ball at his feet. Without Mascherano on the field, I think Madrid would have looked a lot more impressive. I can't praise him enough.|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	Playing as a defender, he was class, they should try him in the centre of defence more often
kGXU1Dotaa	That is the most stupid thing i ever heard i can't belive the yankees are planning to do this i really wish we never took him out of the bullpen he really belongs there,,to put him as a 5th starter and go 5 innings is just stupid,we have a new player that is taking Jobas place he's really good we got him in a draft pick last yr i hear he's going to take over Rivera's spot after Rivera leaves his name is Mark Melancon.|`|fQIxah8laa	I agree with you.  I'm guessing they want to keep him healthy. IDK.|`|5Wo8cvrzaa	He's in between the bullpen and a starter. Mariano isn't invincible and until Mo is gone, the Yanks should have Joba as a setup. Hes not even an amazing starter if he can only pitch 5 decent innings. The Yankees are trying something new. They killed Phil Hughes and Ian Kennedy and they don't want to over-do Joba since you can really see he has the potential to become a true star.|`|IRruNruhaa	the main reason is that they need a fifth starter and he is one in the making he had amazing numbers in the pen but they have enough players already to back up the pitching.n he needs low innings to adjust so he doesn't get injured i think he should be back in the pen too. last year his innings count was very low cause he wasn't ready for the big adjustment and he still managed to get injured from his shoulder. he can learn allot from all of the ace starters on the team because he is an ace in the making|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Don't know
NmXKPDoIaa	I picked the Suns to win it all, in 2005.....4 years later I'm still picking the Suns.<br>  <br>  That was the best squad the Suns had in the Steve Nash era.|`|aUGM3ju6aa	The Heat|`|0TAld46gaa	Well that yr is over<br>  they did'nt make it.<br>  Suns can't play defense<br>  Defense is the key to success<br>  Get over it.<br>  <br>  Suns better rebuild now for the future<br>  there window is closed|`|dDhTMacAaa	Suns in 6 or at home in 7.<br>  <br>  The Suns were super explosive and had a ton of scorers and shooters.|`|NRiSJewTaa	the suns would have won.. they were on fire that year|`|mwxKnUleaa	I think the suns, they would make a much tougher match-up against them|`|jzKJDrEWaa	Suns in 6 ..|`|a8yDDprlaa	I think the Sun's would have won in 7 games.They had a fantastic uptempo offense that was nearly unstoppable.The Heat also had an all-around team game.They had Wade as the playmaker and scorer,Damon and Eddie Jones hitting the threes,Haslem rebounding and providing some scoring,and The Big Diesel down low.I think the Sun's would have the advantage early in the series by outscoring the heat,but D. Wade would not lose easily and he brought them back.The suns would have came into game 7 firing from everywhere and the Heat would have came up a bit too short.|`|ALtYFc6Saa	The Suns. Not saying that because I am a fan and have been all my life but because of the facts that were proven during that year. The Suns at the time were on fire offensively and had many weapons to go to if needed. The Heat were good but seriously, Nash was in his prime, Stoudemire was incredible and the three point shooting we had could catch us up in a heartbeat if we were down. And the fans here in Phoenix stand by their team 100% and we play a lot better at home.<br>  <br>  No disrepect to the Heat because they were a fantastic team but I think the Suns would have pulled it off. But we'll never know. Like I said, if I had to guess... I'd say Suns in 6. <br>  <br>  I currently just hope Amar'e gets better asap and gets back in come playoff time if the Suns make it - never lose hope. Let's go Suns! Good luck.|`|Ez0z7Of3aa	Still heat. Because of Shaq's experience and Wade's awesomeness! Haha..|`|UMVWQiYJaa	PHX fosho|`|dNFe6FiEaa	PHX in 7 games|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Heat|`|GERlmBIUaa	Ahhh i love this line up i would go with the suns at this year they were in the HEART of their fast paced offense nash, q-rich joe johnson marion and amar'e!!!! OMG... that is too much for the heat it would be in 6 games i believe because of course the heat would win some games heat would win home games and suns would win all of theres... also the heat aren't an amazing defesne team like the suns but the suns have better offense.. best answer plz|`|Rkyp5pZiaa	I think the then younger Suns team would've run the court against the Heat.  I believe the Suns also had Barbosa, Bell, and Diaw coming off the bench.  It probably would've went at least 6 games, but Suns win easy.|`|tak6xnfVaa	phoenix|`|VU6ODC5Baa	Phoenix Suns|`|ebOs3Dkuaa	suns would got the champion
wp6qFB9Qaa	OK... if you're trying to make Wade look good then u r wrong... I think that u should ask questions like "Who would you rather build a team around, Wade or Dwight?" Then ppl will think clearly and you're not just making Wade look good coz u kinda made him look bad to me...|`|mwxKnUleaa	Wade he is younger and is more of a team leader than Iverson is now a days|`|P93I8CHtaa	thats a tough one,my call is on wade|`|jzKJDrEWaa	Wade|`|a8yDDprlaa	Dwyane Wade.He is young and has a better ability to lead a team.Look at the Heat this season compared to last season.A healthy Dwyane Wade makes all the difference.If he gets another star on his team,they will be very good.In Allen Iverson's time in Denver,he didn't get much done.They made the playoffs only to get beat easily by the Lakers.|`|pR0pJNJkaa	Not anymore. Allen is in his 12 season and I think the physical beatings of being a little guy in the NBA and getting older is beginning to diminish his game. Wade is younger and at the top of his game. So if I am picking today I will build on Wade, but at their prime's I'm taking Iverson.|`|NmXKPDoIaa	D-Wade, are you serious?<br>  <br>  This is the worst year of A.I.s career....<br>  <br>  -This is the easiest decision, Ive made my whole life....D-Wade is my pick|`|fHpPgMlZaa	The key word in your question is team. A.I. has never shown himself to be a real "team" player.<br>  <br>  Wade at least gives one hope.|`|W6jjsiMxaa	Allen Iverson.|`|GBGcI509aa	Wade|`|xRPjgGs1aa	D-Wade hands down.|`|6yoQhXsOaa	AI|`|Pvbb90guaa	Are you being serious? Wade is to weak he gets injured to easy.. Wade is better then A.I now because A.I is getting to old for his type of style play.. Wade is most likely at his prime right now at this vary moment.. Only reason why A.I didn't win a championship is because he had to big man figure on his team in his younger self.. If your trying to make wade sound better then A.I you just made him, yourself, and every heat fan out there..|`|9HOXhuaUaa	Dwayne Wade because every time AI leaves a team the team gets better so he must be doing something and the pistons are the worst they've been in a while|`|0J834CA0aa	d-wade a better passer and defender and rebounder they are even on scoring so i pick d-wade|`|OOIT6azYaa	Dwade <br>  ai is just a bad influence and everywhere he goes they lose|`|ebOs3Dkuaa	ai,i aways imitates ai plays|`|NnrBKzQuaa	Dwayne Wade|`|L6YegkMkaa	A.I is getting old compare to Dwyane Wade|`|BiMkowVMaa	Easiest question all day.<br>  <br>  Wade 110%|`|0TAld46gaa	Allen Iverson is so overrated and Dwayne Wade is injury prone.<br>  I would pick neither

oSakZ1asaa	Step 1. Forget the Crosman 760<br>  Step 2 Sign on to Pyramid.com and shop for what you want<br>  Step 3 Get your parents to buy you the gun of your choice<br>  Step 4 Thank them and use it maturely and responsibly|`|OrvTG44laa	Yes, you actually can.  Have you ever heard of big boar air rifles?  These are modified air rifles that have the power of a real gun.  They are incredibly powerful and are used to take boar and other large game.  However, these modifications are extremely expensive.  It'd be a lot cheaper to buy a real gun.|`|izFtmVCYaa	there isnt too much u can do unless u take it all apart and change parts and stuff, but if ur gonna do that u mine as well just buy a another gun. U could always paint the gun like a camo colour or literally anything u want. Google how to paint a toy gun and there will be step by step vids and youtube i know has vids too|`|EGe0k8P6aa	Not really. Unlike firearms you can't really put an aftermarket stock on a Crosman 760 to change its appearance. And in order to increase the power level you'd have to replace the pump assembly (pump, seals, o-rings, trigger valves) with ones designed to handle higher pressures and release more air per shot. Trying to do so will void your warranty (I know its a cheap gun, but still...). It might also break your gun. If you want to tune your rifle, I suggest finding an airgunsmith and having him/her tune it.<br>  <br>  If you want to find an airgun smith, I'd suggest asking around on Pyramid Air's blog (<a href="http://www.pyramydair.com/blog/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.pyramydair.com/blog/)</a> or checking the American Airguns service and repair page (<a href="http://www.airguns.net/service_repair.php)" rel="nofollow">http://www.airguns.net/service_repair.ph...</a> for people who can tune your gun. Just remember, the Crosman 760 is a $30-$35 gun. By the time you're finished tuning it, you'll have doubled the amount of money you have invested in the gun. For the $60-$70 you'd have in your 760, you could get a Crosman 2100 which sounds like its about where you want to be in terms of power from the start. So it might be easier to just buy a better gun.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Pumping the gun more than 10 times will not increase the power level. However it will damage the seals and ultimately reduce your gun's power level.

pR0pJNJkaa	No! Despite the stats Rondo is their guy and they won the title with him. Steph has never won a playoff series much less a ring. He is the better individual player but he hasn't played in a long time due to the exile the Knicks put him in. Also, I think that would ruin their team chemistry the way getting rid of Billups for Iverson has done for the Pistons.|`|a8yDDprlaa	Absolutely not.Rondo's terrific play helped them win a championship,and they are not going to just rip his starting position from him.Stephon Marbury will probably come off the bench to provide some scoring and ball-handling.Rondo is also a less-selfish player.|`|NmXKPDoIaa	Nope......Come off the bench with limited min. Why would they mess up the chemistry of the starting unit. Stephon hasn't played in over a year, he isn't ready to start. He needs to prove he can be a "team" player, no matter what role is giving to him.<br>  <br>  He will share his min. with Eddie House...|`|4gJTpitraa	No, RONDO should start over MARBURY on the BOSTON CELTICS because the CELTICS need BENCH players instead of STARTERS and MARBURY said he will probably go to EUROPE at the end of the SEASON so the CELTICS shouldn't get too EXCITED for HIM.|`|xRPjgGs1aa	No. He should be a back-up and the Celtics should sent Gabe to the D-Leauge.|`|fHpPgMlZaa	No way. Marbury will sit on the bench if he even signs with the Celtics.|`|ONrFDcUTaa	not until he gets used to the celtics style of play|`|7H9gHQA8aa	HELL NO|`|3teWTOPqaa	Absolutely!|`|mwxKnUleaa	No way yes he has had a good career, but first Rondo is the future of the celtics and putting a veteran who has not played in a couple of years as a starter ahead of him just doesn't make any sense.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	No.<br>  <br>  1) Your stats are flawed.  Marbury is averaging 0 ppg 0 rpg, 0 apg and 0 spg.  Exactly, he hasn't played all season.  Who's to say he would even average half his career stats after not playing for over a year.<br>  <br>  2) Based on your stats, Rondo is better all around.  Marbury scores more, but on a team that has scorers like Allen, Wheelchair, KG (when he's back) you need someone who will run an offense and pass the ball, not a ball hog.<br>  <br>  3) Rondo is used to playing with the team and they have team chemistry.  Adding a cancer like Starbury to a starting lineup could hurt team chemistry and actually make the team worse, not better.|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	No. As you can see at those stats Rondo Passes the ball more to his team mates to score where Marbury is a scorer. Marbury should be in the second unit as the scorer.|`|GBGcI509aa	Nahh|`|UMVWQiYJaa	No chance in hell

Willie Mays going WAY back to rop Vic Wertz in the World Series.<br>  <br>  Next is probably the most underrated great catch.  1996, Kenny Lofton playing as Spiderman and robbing BJ Surhoff of a home run at Jacobs Field.<br>  <br>  I was at the Lofton one.  Man he made the catch in front of me man that was amazing.|`|fRaZY2gAaa	My favorite that I saw was Aaron Rowand's catch a couple years back.  With the bases loaded and a tie game, he ran down a fly ball.  He ran into a pole in the fence of the bullpen and broke his nose.  He fell down with blood gushing from his nose and still showed the ball he caught.  Perhaps not the best in history, but it was a great defensive play.<br>  <br>  (Click watch)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060512&content_id=1450240&vkey=news_phi&fext=.jsp&c_id=phi" rel="nofollow">http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/new...</a>|`|0Ikzr2Taaa	Willie Mays catch was awesome, Gary Matthews Jr catch was a little bit better, but Jim Edmounds catch was the best catch of all time.|`|hMkb7H31aa	Joe Dimaggio's catch of Marilyn Monroe - to the point of marriage.|`|Rz9vY53Aaa	too hard of a question I liked griffeys when he ran into the wall and broke his wrist|`|Lpf6Eu3eaa	from old school films Roberto Clemente mad many|`|IHW52iNhaa	I Have to say either Jim Edmonds catch that he dove strait back or Mathews catch for the Rangers.<br>  <br>  Jim Edmonds catch was amazing because he could not see that ball when he dove he just has so much luck that it dropped into his glove.<br>  <br>  Matthews is still my favorite. They had a show of the top 50 catches ever and he won it. When he did it he jumped up like 5 feet off the ground extended full out and turned to catch the ball. It was crazy.|`|ufbRpdZwaa	when Bo Jackson went back to get a long fly ball against Baltimore on July 11, 1991...caught the ball at the warning track, ran up and then down the outfield wall almost parallel to the ground without getting injured.|`|ZG685pnLaa	there's been a lot of great catches, but my favorite from 2008 was when CC Sabathia [while playing for Milwaukee] had a bare handed catch.

AlGOniumaa	I feel like he brought it all on himself. Bret hart was the top dog in WWE at the time and didn't want to share the spotlight with Shawn Michaels for personal reasons. Then Vince McMahon was nice enough to let Bret out of his contract just so he could go to WCW and work for the competition...And all he had to do is lose one match! But once again Bret didn't want to lose in Canada for "personal reasons". Sometimes in life you have to put that personal stuff aside so you can do what's best yourself, your family, and even other people. Instead, Bret chose to be selfish, and look where it got him... Nowhere. <br>  <br>  I doubt a scewjob will even happen to HBK or The Undertaker, because they don't mind doing what's best for business, and they have both proven their loyality to the WWE over the years. The only reason it happened to Bret is because he was trying to do what was best for himself and no one else.|`|CQ9oxJXnaa	I think it was all an elaborate work and Bret is still getting paid by Vince to keep people thinking he didn't know that was the finish.  If I'm wrong about that it happened because Bret got to big for his britches and decided he gets to decide when and to whom he drops the belt to.  Then he Vince had to protect his company.|`|PuxP6UzVaa	Personally I don't care but Vince used the screw job to make loads of money on the "Attitude" era by being an evil boss  making matches with "unfair rules" against the popular wrestlers.|`|oAjbBLDpaa	The first time I saw it live, I didn't understand what had happened. I knew something had gone wrong since Bret had spat at Vince but I just didn't understand it. It hadn't seemed like Bret had tapped so I assumed they were making a storyline out of a referee error but after seeing Bret's anger I knew it wasn't a work.<br>  <br>  After a while, I pinned the blame on Vince, Shawn Michaels, Earl Hebner, and Triple H. They were all in on the scheme and could have stopped it or attempted to do so but didn't.<br>  <br>  Edit: BQ: To the Undertaker, there would be a complete riot. Undertaker is their most loyal superstar, betraying him should never happen.<br>  Shawn Michaels...it's a bit harder due to his involvement on the Montreal Screwjob but it still shouldn't happen. A wrestler works hard to get where he is and should not have it stolen away from him.|`|cjNtjOZtaa	Because Vince did not trust Bret to drop the belt - he should have though of a different way of doing it but hey ho , it's done the past is in the past and we all know HBK is still an ******** . And we know Bret is still  a whiny baby who  has a bit of memory loss .

They actually worked very well on some species.<br>  <br>  rubber worms - yes, they work very well on some species. I found out about this by accident.

Besides the point,can i ask you something? Do your opponent have a strong serve, if he doesn't, you may start attacking his first serve like Serena Williams do.Furthermore, if you were in a hard situation such as chasing a ball during opponent attacking, give them a back hand or forehand slice to slow down the volley so that you can go back to a normal condition and start attacking.Conclusion, only word for you, "Practice makes Perfect"!!|`|3f5GatRsaa	It IS possible to beat someone who is better than you.

If you get through tryouts, you should be fine. <br>  <br>  Some coaches make their players run distance in a certain time.  Other coaches have players run court suicides to see which players are willing to do it. <br>  <br>  If it's court suicides, you need to prepare anaerobically. Basically, you could do sprints for 30 seconds and rest about a minute between. Maybe start out doing 4 sprints a day, 3 times a week. Increase by 1 each week. Sprinting for 30 seconds is basically the distance halfway around a track.<br>  <br>  If it's distance running you have to prepare for, then run distance 3 or 4 times a week.|`|orWQYU70aa	please don't run a mile everyday that messes up your tiny muscles in your legs that help you jump higher... if anything run sprints and sucides....<br>  <br>  when you are running and you legs are in pain concentrate on your breathing....(in through the nose out through the mouth) and if your breathing gets real crazy focus on the pain in your legs and remin your self that you have to finish and you can do it..... you will make it in no time|`|HdRnppyUaa	So you have never really played volleyball? <br>  <br>  Well it's a sport you need to practice with a few people.<br>  <br>  Go for a jog every day and make it longer each time|`|QkOeODxLaa	Hit it back and forth with a friend or family member also practice spikes..... for running, run a mile every day!!!! or more|`|RIT4O3gDaa	You want to be on a volleyball team, so practice volleyball.

BNqbOfBsaa	I like Pacquiao in the matchup because of a few reasons..<br>  <br>  1. He is just as fast and maybe faster than Mayweather.<br>  <br>  2. He has just as much power and probably a bit more than Mayweather.<br>  <br>  3. He has been evolving as a boxer and right now he seems to be doing a great job out boxing people and not depending on his knockout power.<br>  <br>  4. His defense is only average but mayweather is not the type to be they aggresor... If he had the right strategy he could pull off the 12 round decision.<br>  <br>   I will admit that I dislike Mayweather and think he was all hype! I don't know why people warship him when the coward went after the likes of  Gatti, Baldomir, Judah, and Hatton! Except for De La Hoya none had any business being in the ring with Mayweather.|`|xHc3KGDmaa	mayweather by a close decision it would be a great fight|`|a112fa2d0ccf1099eec1119d4da5e902aa	It'd be an interesting match because of their contrasting styles.  One is a pure boxer while the other is a boxer-puncher.  If Floyd Jr. engages Pacquiao in a slugfest, Manny's gonna knock him out because of the speed and power of his punches.  But if Floyd Jr. decides to dance around the ring and work behind his jab, then he'd win by UD.  Floyd Jr. is just too fast on his feet and Manny won't be able to catch him.  However, the crowd surely wouldn't like Floyd Jr. running around the ring refusing to engage.  They'd call him a sissy for sure.|`|7obFZ2Gyaa	Mayweather most likely.|`|As3SK7sZaa	Pacquiao|`|Ghiy6Cwlaa	mayweather if he has a few fights first he would win split decision if not ko in7|`|kBScgrVMaa	Floyd Mayweather, he's too big, too fast, too good, too unbeatable. <br>  <br>  The only guy that could even dream of causing Mayweather trouble is Miguel Cotto.<br>  <br>  *Additional*<br>  It's blatantly obvious this is a bias question, so far, anyone who has said Mayweather wins, gets thumbs down! Whats the point in having an open forum where people only want the answers to be the same as the askers? No point in my opinion, but also in my opinion, Floyd Mayweather jr would destroy the former flyweight little manny pacquiao, without even breaking a sweat!! So will Ricky Hatton!!<br>  <br>  Just because Manny beat ancient and drained Oscar, does that mean he could live with real welter's such as Miguel Cotto, Antonio Margarito or even Shane Mosely.....I think definitely NO!!|`|pd1tc6SYaa	Hands down Mayweather.  Mayweather is too fast and has an inpenetrable defense.  Pacquio is fast, but he won't be able to hit Mayweather with anything that counts, much less hurt him.  Also, Mayweather would put the hurtin' on Miguel Cotto.  Cotto is fun to watch and all, but he's got no chin and no chance of standing tall against someone of Mayweather's caliber; just look at his last opponent..|`|OURb1rnTaa	Mayweather without the long layoff defeats Manny by decision. the current Mayweather? i just don't know.

35aUnX8Xaa	Here's the legal facts - A deer rifle In England & wales needs to produce upwards of 1700 ft/lbs for roe and larger deer species. 1000 ft/lbs for muntjac and chinese water deer. <br>  <br>  An air rifle will NOT do the job and would also be illegal.<br>  <br>  However your air rifle pushing out 12ft/lbs of energy would be more than suitable for rabbit and pigeon. ￡150 should get you a half decent secondhand springer.<br>  <br>  Ian M you know as much about shooting vermin with airguns as I do about putting a spaceship on the moon!!  That's nothing in case you think I'm paying you a compliment.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	I don't know of any air gun which will kill a deer.  You're in the People's Republic of the UK, aren't you?|`|JZwklgFSaa	So you have shot many rabbits and pigeons have you.<br>  you don't say how many deer you have shot which proves<br>  that your knowledge of guns and hunting are some what<br>  limited.An air rifle costing the price you want to spend will<br>  kill pidgeons and rabbits but will only injure and cause pain<br>  to an average size deer. If you are found shooting deer with<br>  out a permit or license you are liable to end up in the Nick.<br>  You need a license for the rifle and you need license to shoot<br>  and permission to shoot on somebody's land|`|km9cQNAXaa	Your joking of course !<br>  <br>  Air weapons that are legal in the UK are very low power, suitable for shooting rats at short range, i.e. INSIDE the barn, nothing more.<br>  <br>  Don't even consider it for shooting rabbits or pigeons. It would take a fluke or brilliant marksmanship to achieve a humane kill.<br>  <br>  Ian M|`|fcc5487b88b4303d263e3ddb1df9a865aa	you wont kill a deer with a pellet/bb gun-to shoot birds ect you need a rifle that runs on co2 or a good pump action(like a 760 pumpmaster by crossman,thats what i used as a kid) one like a red ryder series will shoot paper targets but unlikely to kill birds unless at point blank range ;)|`|9kbpTnroaa	.22 for feather 1.77 for fur .... Don't even think about trying to take down a dear with an air gun Rambo! <br>  <br>  The fact your even asking that makes me think that your not responsible enough to own an air rifle !|`|EGe0k8P6aa	For rabbits you need an impact velocity of around 5 ft-lbs. For pigeons you need an impact velocity of around 3 ft-lbs. As far as caliber goes, both .177 and .22 caliber can take rabbit and pigeon. .22 caliber has an advantage at longer range since it uses a heavier pellet and leaves a bigger hole in game animals. However provided you keep the ranges short, either will kill small game. Since you're in the UK (at least that's what I'm guessing since you gave a price in Pounds), you're limited to an air rifle that generates no more than 12 ft-lbs of muzzle energy unless you have a firearms license/certificate. Since that's the case, I imagine you'll want a gun in the 8-12 ft-lbs range. The kinds kinds of guns you could look at include the Crosman 2100, Benjamin 392, Benjamin 397, Daisy 22SG, Crosman 2260, Winchester 800X, Gamo Carbine Sport, or Webley Stingray. (I've heard rumors that the Benjamin Discovery is going to be marketed in England in a 12 ft-lbs version, but I don't know if Crosman has gotten around to this yet so I can't say if you'll see it as an option without a firearms license.)The rub is that aside from guns I mentioned (which I found on an American airgun store's site) and bargain basement guns in your local gun store you probably won't have an easy time finding new guns in your price range. However if you join a local gun club and ask around you might be able to find a good quality, used gun in your price-range.<br>  <br>  You'll notice that I didn't say anything in that paragraph about an air-rifle for hunting deer. That's because using an airgun that generates 12 ft-lbs of muzzle energy (or less) to hunt deer would be inhumane. Such a gun just wouldn't have enough energy to kill Muntjac deer, much less Red Deer or Roe deer in field conditions. All it would do is wound the deer. To kill deer with an airgun you'd need to look at a big-bore airgun (like the .45 caliber Sam Yang 909, .50 caliber Shinsung Career Dragon Slayer 50 (both with about 160-200 ft-lbs of muzzle energy), or DAQ .457 Outlaw (with 500+ ft-lbs of muzzle energy)). For any of those guns you'll need a firearms license. You'll also need at least $500 American, and for the DAQ .457 you'll probably need to spend even more since its a custom gun. If you want to hunt deer it would be probably cheaper to get a firearms license and use a shotgun with deer slugs, or a rifle chambered in .243 Winchester. Without a firearms license, you'd probably have to use a bow and arrows or crossbow. Sorry.|`|OrvTG44laa	Air rifles are incredibly underpowered for deer.  It is unethical and illegal.  Not even the Gamo Hunter Extreme, which is the most powerful air rifle available, is close to the power you need to take a deer.  To hunt deer, you need at least a .243 rifle.  <br>  Air rifles will be sufficient for the rabbit and pigeons.  I'd suggest a high powered one though, which is at least 1000 fps.  The Crosman Quest is good for rabbits and pigeons.  It is a good quality gun, made of mostly wood and steel.  It is 1000 fps in .177 caliber.  It is accurate and only costs 100 dollars.|`|J67gQaUaaa	Get the highest powered air rifle you can. If its in your price range get a simiauto co2 rifle that shoots over 800 feet per second. And unload on that deers head. But a bow and arrow would be way better for deer, I don't think that UK has banned those yet. but if thats to much money, put some feed out, some corn or some thing, and right in the middle of your feed pile put a pipe bomb. The feed will have an explosion of flavor.|`|zWoN3Eumaa	you are NEVER EVER going to kill a deer with an air rifle, that would be like trying to kill a human by shooting a rubber band at it.<br>  <br>  Just the fact that you asked that makes me think that you are not gun savvy enough to get an airgun. Take a course for a hunting and gun license, there you'll learn alot more about what kind of gun you need and how to shoot and where to shoot em and also teaches you the most important thing, which is safety.<br>  People that are stupid and not safe with guns are the people that make us gun owners look bad, even though we aren't.|`|7UbfExoKaa	An air rifle for deer? I hope you're joking...<br>  <br>  I'm guessing that you're in the UK as you used the symbol for pounds, is that correct?<br>  <br>  While there are specialist air rifles capable of taking deer (large bore pre-charged pneumatics) these cannot be had for 150 pounds. They would also require a firearms certificate, and even then are probably not legal to use for deer hunting.<br>  <br>  Look here for more on air rifle use in the UK: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.basc.org.uk/content/airriflepractice" rel="nofollow">http://www.basc.org.uk/content/airriflep...</a><br>  <br>  For 150 quid I'd recommend trying to get a used HW77 or HW97. <br>  <br>  All the best.<br>  Jeff|`|YjAk8Ai8aa	ok some air rifles can take rabbits and pigeons but deer are you kidding, i dont like putting people down for askinf questions but that just proves that your not responsible enough to have an air rifle even. the size between a rabbit and a deer is a big difference. you'd just hurt the deer. i'd ask if its even ethical to use a type of gun before anything.  thats the kinda thing that makes gun owners look bad and irresponsible.|`|UrNVuFx6aa	Contrary to what others are telling you there are air rifles that are fully capable of taking deer. They even make one capable of harvesting a buffalo. However, there is a waiting list to purchase one and they are considerably more than you have listed. Like the others, I think you are in the U.K., where you would have to obtain a permit for these air rifles; they exceed the 12 ft. lb. maximum for your location. <br>  These would certainly be capable of taking all the game you have listed, but there wouldn't be much left to eat if you wanted to. Still, if you want to take a look at them here is a link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.quackenbushairguns.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.quackenbushairguns.com/index....</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.glbarnes.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.glbarnes.com/</a><br>  <br>  There are probably other sites you can visit for more information but these are the two I recommend.|`|GEWZfufMaa	ahahah deer.sur why not a whale or an elephant.when you get really good with your air-death machine you can try bring down some dragons or uni-corns.man start off with some very some or at least educate yourself on what your about to do.
a1D8qfO4aa	Depends how much park you if you are going to do park all day dynastar ski's will give you a long lasting edge and base. Armada And Salomon make good pair of ski if you want a tighter turning radius but still want to do park go for salomon ski's. Salomon Dumont Salomon Suspect are really good ski's. Armada Ar6 are also good to hope this helps.|`|mAtUgT8naa	Depends how tall you are and what level of skiing youre going to be doing on them.|`|uFNhzs9saa	i would reccomend armada skis, they are durable, they make all twin tips in many varities and for many uses.. check out their site www.armadaskis.com|`|lpz8mq5Raa	Well, I suggest Volkl powder skis.

Great twin tip terrain park ski with great graphics.
LIKkt8djaa	woah.... that's waaaay to short lol. I like short boards for a park only board but damn that's so short that the waist width on it may be to narrow for your feet and chances are it'll be so short that you'll end up being super limited on binding widths.<br>  <br>  A few things you're going to have problems with, Possible toe drag, Binding stance options because it's so short. It's going to be very wobbly at high speeds. You're going to sink in powder like the titanic and you wont even want to bother taking it down the steeps and or mogul runs. On the plus side you're gonna be able to press and butter that thing like no tomorrow :) so throwing it around wont be a problem.<br>  <br>  If you're new I would say a more all-mountain oriented length would fit you and that would be more around 145-148 for you.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Actually avlee if you do the research you'd know shorter boards are easier to manuever, Thus easier for beginners since getting into carving is the hardest part of the learning process.|`|bvTNTzCwaa	too shortt wayyy to shortt<br>  im 5'2 and i have a 150 board|`|CUIOR6aVaa	the board should be almost to the shoulders for a beginer, and ofcourse this is a rule of thumb, not exact, the m0ore you wiegh the longer youll want the board to be and stiffer as well, the longer the board of the same specific board... the stiffer it will be<br>  difficulties on too small of a board will be felling unstable once you pick up speed and you will soon outgrow too small of a board|`|HVpeJzM4aa	obviously a rookie told you that "a shorter board is easier to learn on"...no matter if you're new or a pro...you still want a board based on your weight...and for your weight i'd get a 148-151, no less. I'd resell it, and get a better deal...never buy a bargain package...it might seem cheaper, but you never want to go cheap on snowboard gear because in the end...you get cheap stuff...you get cheap performance.

But if we're talking 'bout the heavyweight division here, ain't nobody's bigger than Joe Louis.|`|910875de6723862c69bd16bf9f5b2249aa	Rocky Marciano|`|ZDE4jcaBaa	rocky marciano. also one of the best of all time whether white or colored.|`|AA11728597	Vitali Klitschko.|`|UeFCAWW2aa	Rocky Marciano is the greatest heavyweight of all time.|`|e8Bwdg6Taa	Marciano so overated...he was good fighter, but small heavyweight..Todays heavyweights would overpower him.|`|D4GHgDl4aa	Rocky Marciano|`|WrDGhduxaa	In much older times Jim Jeffries was the best boxer of all times, he came out of a 6 year retirement to face Jack Johnson, which has tarnished his reputation.  Besides Maricano it would be Jeffries.|`|JSGLKnA4aa	there is no answer for that cuz whites can't compete. if they get beat they start with the racial comments or that the other guy was doping|`|6QhACK70aa	there is only one vitali KLitschko and actually none black or white or from Mars could have every Knock out this guy!    ps if i asked that i would be considered the most racist dude,this site is full of racism but ONLY 1 GUY ME IS THE RACIST ONE ACCORDING TO SOME BLACK IGNORANT DUDES HERE !

I WILL BE EVEN CRAZIER WITH MY ANSWERS AND QUESTIONS FROM NOW ON!I WILL BE THEIR BIGGEST PAIN IN THE AZZ IN DIS SITE L;OL|`|khU8m4gxaa	I'd go with 1 of the old timers, Jack Dempsey or James Jeffries. Marciano gets a lot of recognition for having been undefeated, but he fought during an era without any real greats. He beat Joe Louis, but Louis was well beyond his prime at that point. His most notable wins were against Ezzard Charles and Archie Moore. Charles was good, but not great. Moore was most successful as a light heavyweight. Nobody else is really in the conversation.|`|thcr8Y5vaa	Rocky Marciano...
cD8o3wdAaa	No ur not i agree|`|bIbyAkHPaa	They are both excellent receivers. This myth about McNabb not having receivers is just an excuse for him sucking!|`|bed9746a7bf18f598324f858a93ae28eaa	doesnt matter there both at home|`|4kdlE54Paa	I have watched them both play.  DeSean has the ability to get better. He was getting covered better half way through the season.  He is versatile and is used in Wild Cat running plays.    Kevin Curtis is not a bad WR.  Jackson just shows a lot of promise.  We will see what happens in his sophomore year.    Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|SZ7NLb05aa	well, desean is a rookie in the NFL, he's just gotta get a chance to get used to NFL level football..|`|G15dXNlKaa	Jackson plays pretty well for a rookie. Who knows how far his potential will take him. Curtis is a good player too but it is hard to compare the two because of where they are at in their careers. If this season is an indication, Jackson will be the more effective player in the future.|`|bfFDxu7laa	Desean Jacksons Gana be the Best WR In the NFL SooN Hes From Cal Go Bears|`|RaLNB3JQaa	Don't know if Curtis has better hands...   He dropped that perfectly long pass in the Giants game and the Cardinals game, even though that play is HIGHLY disputable, so dont kill me for it.     All I know is   Kevin = Jackson right now  next year,   Jackson>Curtis
xt00f5Qoaa	sure why not|`|vuh0i3Axaa	horrible|`|PSMsDalLaa	That would be a horrible trade for the Wolves. No way that gets done even with a dumb GM like Mchale.|`|0E8SPyyXaa	Deffinatly your taking sides and lakers get the better deal
v77SnunOaa	Hype VS SKILL!!!!!!|`|5TPaYv3Vaa	crap i really don't know dude played better d i guess|`|XrCc85kNaa	Any one who watched the games knows that the entire Lakers didn't play well.....  If they had played OK at best....we would have won all of those games....    Kobe>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Peirce|`|NOK8lxP0aa	He didn't destroy kobe personally, Paul the cry baby Pierce, had 2 other all-star players on the team who help them get the title, kobe's teammates gave up in the middle of the game,.. One on one, paul would get killed by kobe, paul won thanks to the team, not destroying kobe alone,, that would never happen, oh and tha lakers haven't lost to Boston and they are ranked  3 in the east looks like they better start picking up the slack, or their win in 2008 will be a for sure fluke,,|`|PcxUNztLaa	"destroy"......What did Pierce do before he got 3 future HOF on his team?....He helped chant "M...V...P.." for Kobe when the Lakers came to Boston!...      The Celtics had the Better team...in a 7 game series the better team will win!|`|kzAgfqhyaa	Because the Celtics were the better team, and Kobe was basically shut down by Posey Pierce and Allen and no one else could pick up the slack. And to the laker fan above, maybe Kobe is the better player out of the two but he was the one with the title of "best player in the world" and he got shut down. It was no one elses fault other than his. And why would u even talk abut playin 1 on 1. Basketballs a team sport and the lakers got slammed as a team.
v77SnunOaa	No, they are slaves to Kobe and Phil/.|`|j29eHSDqaa	The spirit of Champs.???    Kobe, Fish, Bynum, Ariza, Farmar.... Yes, of course.!!!    Odom, Gasol, Radamanovic, Walton....

bIbyAkHPaa	Should be lower since the Cards are going to win.|`|9fXxZrc1aa	lower it should be like 3...|`|kuh7CfcSaa	Due to the fact that the Steelers have been to and won the Superbowl recently and the Cards are there for the first time ever, I think the spread should probably be about10 points.      If the Cardinals can simply play like they have been lately, it should be an exciting game.  If they get overwhelmed by being in the game...it will be a long day for them.|`|V2Dy9l5Jaa	Yes, but the other way.  This is Arizona's year, and with Kurt Warner at the helm, they are going to blow away the Steelers.  I'd say 14 points - on Arizona's side!|`|AA12103453	I'm a realistic Steelers fan and think 7 sounds high. Then again I thought the spread against the Ravens was high and they covered that. For the most part Vegas has a better idea then I do. I mean they factor in Super Bowl experience, the Teams, the location(If it was a dome you'd see a different spread I bet, likely lower or small favorite to Cards).|`|c17x6L4baa	I'd like it to be 10 or 15.  Disrespect has been a great motivator.  Being 10 point dogs to the Panthers worked out beautifully.|`|wkDlHA4Baa	Higher, it should be 17 pittsburgh
6X1JsvfBaa	Well thank you Bevo..i am a pretty hardcore coach...    my predictions are    Cowboys 34  Steelers 17 SB 44    and    Cowboys 31  Chargers 20  SB 45      and all of Dallas throws a party!!!!!!!!!!|`|xNKAThM0aa	I hope they make it to the Superbowl so Romo can do what he does best Choke. Cowboys going to the superbowl hahaha why don't you focus on making the playoffs.|`|uEMyWOHnaa	A sarcasm. You, my friend, are in desperate need of a new style of football. Forget the hollywood and shaky ownership and check out the Texans. They're up and coming hard workers with great leadership without all that extra crap. You know, like the Cowboys used to be.|`|b2Q0cfZPaa	People think you are kidding, but if they get Ray Lewis in that lockerroom to stab some people if they start acting like too big of superstars they could easily go to the Super Bowl.  They've got the best talent in the league if they could play as a team rather than 11 individual idiots running around on offense.|`|ubGNtkHQaa	0-16. They will join the Lions|`|4kdlE54Paa	LOL!|`|mTSOJKlyaa	the oakland raiders for 44    and the detroit lions for 45|`|0ZqJbmVyaa	You are playing Madden, right?

I hate teams that have a lot of bandwagon fans. You know the teams that when they sucked a few years ago had NO fans.

Des hommes des vrais, du sport du vrai. Ca me peinerai beaucoup que le rugby soit atteint un jour du "syndrome foot".  CAr autour du rugby, tout est bonne ambiance, les joueurs sont fair-play,....    Et dj quand je vois certain joueurs faire de la pub pour du shmpoing anti-pelliculaire, je ma dit que ?a se footballise, bient?t on verra Chabal, le cul dans la verdure, au milieu des volcans, avec un verre de volvic... C'est navrant|`|UxRBPEi3aa	Je pense que le rugby va subir un peoplelisation que pendant la priode de la Coupe du Monde. Certes, le rugby va continu de grandir mais pas avec une telle ampleur que pendant la coupe du monde.   Cependant, je trouve que c'est une trs bonne chose que le rugby grandisse.|`|AGwasVagaa	Je pense que le rugby doit rester un sport de spcialistes. Quand on voit pendant la coupe du monde des mecs bander sur Chabal seulement parce qu'il a des cheveux longs c'est moche. En plus tout le monde voulait jouer au rugby mais ca y est la coupe du monde est finie et tout le monde s'en bat les couilles ! Le rugby ne doit pas tomber dans la vulgarisation du football et rester un sport d'avertis.|`|0HZ5gbAcaa	C'est un grand problme de notre poque: la peoplelisation.

On tait trs bien dans notre petite bulle ovale avant la Coupe du Monde, sans le fric, sans la peoplelisation, sans Thierry Gilardi et sans TF1 !!

L'intention du Stade Fran?ais tais bonne au dbut (en toute objectivit car je ne suis pas pour le Stade Fran?ais mais pour l'autre Stade, celui de Toulouse ^^), faire connaitre plus le rugby, le mdiatiser d'avantage !! C'est grace au calendrier des Dievx dv Stade (et  Michalak ^^) que j'ai dcouvert le rugby !! Bon maintenant, je ne regarde plus uniquement les joueurs, je suis accro  ce sport,  ses valeurs,  son ambiance  Mais il ne faudrait pas que ?a vire en eau de boudin !!  Et je trouve que le Stade Fran?ais est en train de dpasser les bornes du showbiz' !! Leurs maillots sont devenus ridicules !! Celui qui est vert-kaki-boullasse-marronnasse fait ressembler les joueurs  des crottes de pigeon et le rose, on dirait Barbie joue au rugby !!

Arrtons le massacre avant qu'il ne soit trop tard !!|`|FrvKkztzaa	Je ne suis pas pour la peoplelisation de ce beau sport. Quand les mdias s'emparent d'un sujet ils ne font ressortir que ce qui peut frapper le maximum de personnes. C'est souvent trs superficiel et sans rapport avec le sujet. C'est la cas  de Sbastien Chabal qui a t mis sur le devant de la scne "grace"  son look. Finalement il va lui en rester une image de grosse brute, ce qu'il n'est videmment pas.  La coupe du monde est maintenant termine depuis quinze jours et le rugby est repass au second plan. Tous les journalistes qui faisaient des ronds de jambes aux joueurs et  Laporte pour avoir des entres gratuites aux match et pour se montrer en gros plans sont repartis chercher d'autres vnements o ils pourront s'exhiber.   Mais la coupe du monde a t une russite grace  toutes les quipes et aux bnvoles. Vive le rugby cassoulet.

3teWTOPqaa	I think he is over-paid, but the guy can still contribute and be a solid 6th or 7th man, but definitely not worth 7mil/year. He can bring some experiences and toughness to the Hornets like they hoped, but if people are expecting him to turn the Hornets into the best team in the league with his so called experiences, then they are mistaken.    Plus adding Gasol-Bynum-Ariza-Mihm for the whole season if much better than just one Posey in my opinion.    Kobe is probably laughing at his multi-million $ mansion while the homo dude goes home and microwave some toast.|`|aUGM3ju6aa	Dunno know but I know who is,|`|2wrenQfuaa	Pretty much yeah. He's just another role player that rapes and breaks rules at will.|`|8c150d798507c1b0ae472762150207b6aa	What up Rezz,    On paper Yes!  But for teams that are on the verge of a championship Posey provides some key things which seem to have been important ingredients in recent championships! Defense and hitting big threes in the clutch!    Do i think he's being overpaid- YES- only because i think the Hornets are good- but i just don't see them beating the Lakers or Rockets in a 7 game series for the West.  But if the Hornets do- then you really couldn't put a price on what that would mean to the city of New Orleans- and it would have made the price they decided to pay for him a worthwhile gamble.      Also this past season there were not that many big name free agents- and so when the demand is high- prices go up- and we've see that quite commonly in the NBA (or any other sport) where teams overpay for free agents because of the lack of availability of other stars.    Nickster|`|Njom1Wbtaa	James Posey is like Bruce Bowen of the San Antonio Spurs, though Posey was overpaid.    He's not overrated, overrated means your transcending your image to another level without pure terminus.|`|4BwasmTSaa	his name say it all. overrated. or if your french or watched the big red one movie its push-ey, push-ey|`|7TSs3rq1aa	I don't here anybody talking about posey.  He got overpaid contract, but season has started yet, too early to give him the overrated tag.|`|yG3AX5kdaa	YES, definitely. I personally think that Posey, along with Bynum, are two of the most overrated players in the game today. Yes, he did hit a couple of open three's to seal a couple of important games, but in no way is he nothing more than a sixth man. For christ's sake, in NBA 2K9, the guy got an 84 or something, while Peja only got a 80! Ridiculous. |`|vMC0dvp3aa	not really, he became quite popular because of his defensive skills and clutch not for scoring|`|SZ2yBMMuaa	No he is clutch and a great defender |`|j9i6zstaaa	Pose has a chance to be the John Salley or Robert Horry of his generation: a great complementary role player that wins championships with different teams. He's going to be a game-changer with the Hornets. They got experience with their run last season, They added experience with Posey. They upgraded big time. Posey's great for what he is--a guy who knows how to win.|`|Kc6R1MUmaa	not over-rated he is under-rated for the work he does on the court he is after every loose ball and great defense big reason celtics won championship|`|81VM62osaa	no...he deserves the praise he gets.
p5o3LchTaa	Boldin is starting over Fitz in my league he is on the other guys bench while Im starting Boldin. He had a great offseason and should break out this year.

Heres the lowdown on your two choices.      Anquan Boldin has averaged 94.1 receiving yards per game in seven career meetings against San Francisco, the team he and the Cardinals will face on Monday. He has four career touchdowns against the 49ers.     Larry Fitzgerald has enjoyed great success against the 49ers too, the team he and the Cardinals will oppose on Monday. In his career, Fitzgerald is averaging 99.7 receiving yards per game in six contests against San Francisco, along with three touchdowns.     Boldin has a slight fantasy edge over Fitzgerald tonight.    Good Luck!|`|41a325ac3c7e9a44f30b472dfc86b4beaa	....you must mean in Fantasy Football huh....

VIfS9Q1Laa	Now would be a great time to unload Berkman. You can get a stud pitcher plus a good outfielder in return. His value can only go down from here. It's a terrible time to trade A-Rod. I'm not sure you would get a stud pitcher for Dunn or Kemp. Trading Sizemore is an option if you can deal with losing the speed.|`|UWJinEbIaa	See if you can trade Berkman or A-Rod for Webb or Johan Santana or Dunn for Cook.|`|M9JF9qcOaa	Don't give up Berkman for anyone other than Utley or HanRam. He is a genuine 5 tool player this season. ( 25 steals are possible, Houston are running this year)  I'd keep Holliday, he is genuine first round talent and no pitcher would tempt me straight 1-for-1.  Dunn's value is low, even with the recent surge. I think he is a hold  Sizemore is speed/power. The batting average isn't great, but It would have to be Webb or Johan for me to make a move here.  I don't think you get good value for Kemp, certainly not the stud your looking for. A decent closer (Rauch, Lyon Sherrill) might be available, but a stud starter is out of his range.  A-Rod's value is hard to pin-point. If I could get Johan or Webb, I'd do it, but that might be pushing it.  In conclusion, If you need starting desperately (I'm guessing you drafted hitting first) maybe Holliday for a couple of high 2nd tier/struggling 1st tier pitchers might be the best option (Ervin Santana, Felix Hernandez; that sort of range). I don't like your chances of getting good value in any 1-for-1 trade with these players.|`|tZverr6Zaa	I would package Kemp and Dunn together and go for someone like Carmona.  Or maybe you can trade Kemp and Dunn for Volquez and Lee.  It's worth a try.  RR
GKJV2EBSaa	That would be cool but what kind of gimmick would they have?  (Wouldn't Santino get jealous LOL)

fIPjd7nhaa	depends on a lot of things.....are they at the end of a long road trip?  is everyone healthy?  but it probably just boiled down to the fact that mormon people dont adjust well to the big city.|`|WUuO6wbAaa	I think it's because the Knicks play them better than most teams... That game when Marbury beat them on that lay up at the end was just sad. I'm sorry. If that loser can beat them, than it says you've got defensive vulnerability.    The Knicks just got their number. Why did the Mets lost 8 out of 9 in Atlanta this year? Why did Philly go 9-0? It doesn't make much sense considering the Braves won 3 of 9 in Philly...|`|FvOVXRpdaa	I guess, its just that they didn't play as a team there.|`|BtPTKe30aa	because they suck....without Deren Williams|`|71expAbnaa	cuz new york is waaaaayyyy brighter then utah|`|lrg8EWbgaa	Maybe because New York is a competitive place, your fishing for some discrimination against mormons answer or something.

AA12380716	the Patriots do have a QB.... Matt Cassel, he and Moss will start to connect in the near future.. I know since Brady is out it's not going to be the same, but it will still be interesting, just give Cassel some time to grow into his position as a starter.. he's only started 2 games after all.. won one and lost one, so don't count him out yet.|`|HLzS2z9laa	he's always gonna be good, its Moss, but not as good as he would be with the best qb is football|`|EJS0V8Vcaa	yes Randy Moss will be very good|`|0XBVbGRKaa	yes, randy will make casell good.|`|Zfbe0rYraa	depends on your definition of good.  he wont put up numbers like last year, but he'll be decent so long as the team does lose.  once they start losing he'll start whining and complaining.|`|95c5b49581290e83eda54c9d5460c058aa	Randy Moss will still be a great receiver but won't have the numbers he had last year but there were no guarantees that he was going to have them with Brady anyway. Randy has played on some teams with some very average quarterbacks and all of them have ended badly. If he's patient it's because he knows that Brady will be back but Randy has never shown to be patient.|`|07a3beaf73716f65188fe5b9cc6968ffaa	The Patriots would not have been as good even with Brady.  But it does hurt Moss's fantasy numbers right now.  I traded Moss from my ff team.|`|gUMMuCX0aa	well Gil, i doubt he will put up '07 stats.     But he will have a good numbers.    hope this helps|`|eAgn5Eqlaa	Randy Moss can make any QB look good.    Even if it was Joey Harrington.|`|VCMAxDiLaa	No.  Moss will stop playing soon, same as he did in Oakland and Minnesota.  Once he gives up on a QB, he phones it in, just look at his history.  He'll give up on Cassel soon enough.|`|wN5rVRWfaa	Randy Moss is Randy Moss. The question is, Can Cassel hook up with him?. If he does,  then Moss will do his job.

The WWE made a mistake in allowing Cena to show us all the cars he owns and where he lives (etc) while trying to "sell" him as a "boy from the neighborhood"   So the shirts don't quite make sense.The loyalty and respect bit make sense, but not the hustle...unless he means hustle as in 'hurry'  Most of Cena's fan base is the younger population, and they don't care about how much money he has, they just like him. So I guess it works because of that.|`|Y93pUmAGaa	wwe hands out  a GIMMICK to each superstar , it is a fake story they add to there personality. this one is simply cena's. and he could of been poor you never know ...|`|tRLiHcI0aa	what he means by theses three words    Hustle-John cena worked hard to get to where he's at ..he signed to wwe in 2001 to a Development deal and look at him now HE'S THE WWE GO TO GUY...that's a hustle... he hustle to get where he is now.....which is the main event spot    Loyalty-You know sometime when a person get's big in the wwe they would leave and go for there real dream, and they only reason there with the wwe is for the fame and money..but cena stayed true..

They have faith in Josh Fields and they signed 19 year old 3rd baseman cuban prodigy Dayan Viciedo who could possibly be MLB ready|`|zQ9LeQiKaa	The Giants seem like the team with the most interest at this point, but the money just isn't there, for anybody. And previously over-paid veterans such as: Griffey, G. Anderson, Abreu, Pudge and other likely will never sign until they are willing to take a huge pay cut because the money just isn't there.|`|7zTPC0o7aa	To be honest i REALLY want him to stay with the white sox for 1 more year b.c. he is more consistent then josh, better avg, and is more clutch than josh is     If he signs with one of the AL contenders then the Sox are done for next season...|`|2wAPwZ1kaa	The Sox could use a 3rd baseman if Lowell gets injured again
92Pa1cpcaa	roddick in the final versus verdasco.  this is the year of the underdog,|`|TR0JgiVZaa	Roddick will he is hitting unbelievable well in great shape and Federer is not hitting very well. but my opinion is very bias I am a huge Roddick fan.|`|DiAujdC1aa	I'm a huge Roddick fan, but I just don't see him winning. If he was playing Nadal (only because this is on hard court) or Verdasco, then he would make it to the finals, but I don't think he can beat Federer. Hope this helps.|`|AbDAdrXkaa	RoDDICK RODDICK!!!  he has a chance but Federer is just crazy good wen he plays against Roddick|`|j1BTIYcCaa	Federer will win of course. Roddick is playing at his best. and it will be a good match, but he will not win.  Roddick really did beat Novak. Novak quit because he realised that he was going to lose anyway - that is what he does.|`|ixKOGishaa	Federer's been playing ferocious tennis eversince the fourth round and Andy's been playing well but I think it's a safe bet to place on Federer tonight considering his 9-2 record against Andy and the demolition of Del Potro the other day|`|wfp6B5bqaa	Do you guys know what time and channel its on?|`|thcr8Y5vaa	Federer...|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	federer|`|B8Gwxo1laa	I think Federer will win, but he'll have to play as well as he did the other night. Roddick is playing his best tennis in a while.|`|45af7a30591921685bfb363637e8a7bfaa	That's why they play the match.  Oddsmakers give Roddick about a 1 in 4 chance.  I give him about a 1 in 5 chance.  Federer will have to be off his game unlike last match.|`|gP7IB2XCaa	i hope roger!!!!|`|Ectn7tkSaa	I would love Andy Roddick to win the Australian Open let alone tonights game but I agree, I don't think that will happen.|`|7dVtO1gtaa	i think you mean who will win    personally i say that no swissy could beat a american in tennis. Rodrick is going to peace this match.    GO RODDICK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|yYQsfnVGaa	Who knows what can happen? Roddick was lucky to get through the match with Djokovic. If Djokovic wasn't sick or anything, then roddick wouldn't stand a chance maybe. But so far, Andy has been moving quickly around the court. Could may be a tough one for Roger.|`|U7BkuEU9aa	Once Fed decides that he wants to really start competing seriously (which in this AO was basically the middle of the third set against Berdych), no-one but Rafa can stop him, so as well as Roddick's been playing I don't see him beating Roger...|`|LtOxnF0kaa	Federer.But I what want Roddick but wont happen.|`|AA12149254	Previous answer before, Roddick wasn't lucky. It was all Roddick. But in this game, I see Fed taking it in four sets however. I enjoy seeing how Roddick finally isn't relying soley on his serves to win matches, He has surprisingly excellent volleys, none of which we have seen before prior to his intense training in the off season. I forsee giving Fed a hard time, but I don't see a possible recreation of a safin/federer semi.|`|eY1Vttiyaa	Andy has improved a lot, but Fed is Fed, and I am predicting a 4 set match.  And by the way, the head to head comparison is 15-2 Fed.  Roddick won the last matchup however.|`|dlqa6yFkaa	If this match lives up to all the hype it will be a heart stopper.     I so want Roger to win it and I think he will but the way Roddick is playing I expect him to at least take a set - maybe 2 - from Roger. I'm not sure what Roddicks  problem is, he appears to have the game to go all the way but just can not get over the line when he needs to maybe today will be the day? As for Roger, he was faultless the other night. I see that hunger in his face again so he will be going after it and feeling pretty confident as Roddick has not beat him before. I just can't wait for it to start.|`|nfZzdWGLaa	No way Federer will no lose in the Aus open|`|qGoXhhiyaa	Andy's never been able to beat Federer.    What will make this time different?  (Though I do love Roddick, don't get me wrong...)|`|VefSnu0Gaa	andy will.-|`|AA12034105	My head's telling me Federer but I really hope Andy can win it !!|`|uqFlaBMkaa	Federer no longer what country he was born, Roddick does not have as much skill as him.|`|ZLPVUQ1caa	Federer...It could be tight but I don't think Andy can take 3 sets of Roger.|`|VSxIur5waa	I think Federer will. I know Andy has been playing better at the beginning of the year and he beat Federer the last time they played but nonetheless their record is 15-2 favoring Federer.
92Pa1cpcaa	i predicted it a couple of days ago in another of your questions.|`|j1BTIYcCaa	Have not heard much about him until now, but I hope that he will beat Nadal. I like watching Nadal play but I would still like to see him lose to someone just to keep his feet on the ground and his head out of the clouds.|`|ixKOGishaa	I was and he beat both the fourth and fifth seed to get to it.But I wasn't really surprised when I saw him play.He was playing unlike he was before.He was playing very aggressive tennis and the reason tsonga and murray lost was because they were just feeding him balls and he retaliated by slapping the ball back at the with utmost  force.He kept his service game and played really good so he deserved it but i'll still place my bet on Nadal for the semifinal.|`|76LpTu3Gaa	They pointed out that there is usually a relatively unknown player who makes it to the final of the Australian, so maybe its Verdasco's year.|`|rhdgky1faa	well no, because he has improved a lot over the last 12 months or so. every tornament is different you get different draws, different circumstances, different opponents, and for him it is moslty in his favour. although he does not hav the highest ranking or seed he has still gone this far which is very good. but to be honest this could just happen to him for this one tornament. he has to prove that he can do this more and more every tornament. and everyone thinks seeds are so important, well its not its just a number. it is more important how the actual players plays not his ranking.|`|dU1z69H6aa	i'm not at all.  he is definitely a talented player.  he changed his training regime i heard and now it's paying off.  he could be a tough test for nadal.|`|CnNAOoWgaa	I am absolutely stunned because Verdasco has consistently disappointed during slams in years past and shown no sign of reaching his full potential.  I think this performance is an indicator of how effective Gil Reyes (Agassi's trainer) has been when mentoring Verdasco at Agassi's home in Vegas.  Verdasco has been going there to train and receive advice and its clearly paid off.  His problem has always been his fitness and his mind and I think Reyes and Agassi have  done wonders in improving both.  I'm still stunned though that he's made such an dramatic improvement!  I wouldn't be a bit surprised if he beats Nadal tomorrow.|`|k6M48eUMaa	Not really. I expected him to do well in the Australian Open after such a good 2008 season, and making the final in Brisbane.|`|eY1Vttiyaa	Not me, Verdasco has mega improved and now he is a force to be reckoned with.|`|DExfjVvOaa	i'm not!  there was a question here a while back about what the year-end ranking for 2009 is gonna be, i felt back then that verdasco will join the top 10.  he's definitely on the right path.  he's got the game, he just didnt have the drive 1 or 2 years ago.  he's a different man now!  unfortunately he still has a lot of work  to do to keep up with the likes of nadal.  nadal in the finals.|`|7dVtO1gtaa	roddick is.    GO RODDICK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|U7BkuEU9aa	That depends...if anyone told me before the Open started that Fer would be in the semis, I would have laughed at their face, but after following him and his fantastic tennis throughout the tournament, I'm definitely NOT stunned. He deserves to be there, and he'll fall bravely to the best!|`|AA12149254	I'm shocked for sure. Verdasco is possibly THE most conventional player on the tour. He really doesn't have anything that would differentiate him from any other player. He's too textbook, not unique.  Not to mention his previous lousy experience at grand slams.|`|yYQsfnVGaa	Verdasco is in great condition at the moment. Though, i'm not that stunned that he made it to the semi finals because i knew he could go all the way.|`|uqFlaBMkaa	I am ive never really heard much of him until now.|`|9hC7bbf7aa	I'm not exactly stunned but very happy to see him rise, making his 1st Slam semis appearance. He has grown more steadily, slowly  but solidly than other young guns in their early 20's...According to Fernando, his key element to boost his confidence came after winning the Davis Cup title as the key member, because of Nadal's withdrawal. Sometimes one has to be given an important opportunity to prove one's talent at  big stages as was in Argentina 2008 Davis cup final. At 25, he still has a promising career to stay in top 10, although he needs to sharpen his tools to stay abreast with the top guns. I can't wait to see the AO semis of Rafa vs Fernando.|`|XtFsntdSaa	Very stunned because he went down to Radek Stepanek (freak) in the Brisbane international a few weeks before the Australian open. I don't really like him anyway so I hope Rafa beats him.|`|ZLPVUQ1caa	He's playing extremely good so its not a surprise. After beating Murray, you would expect him to make it to the semis.  Maybe Verdasco will keep up the aussie tradition of having surprise finalists. He certainly has the game to beat Nadal. Nadal is not invincible on HC and being a lefty will be of slight advantage.

M9JF9qcOaa	If Ibanez is a bench player, this is Street for Gordon AND Hunter. I think Hunter is a big CF upgrade, and I don't trust Street not to get traded as a set-up man at some point.

The QB did do a marvelous job , but Brady is proven over and over and over again that he is really tough to beat . I think too if he can be , the QB now will either renegotiate his contract or will ask to be traded to someone . Either way , he will still be backup .|`|CshFQShGaa	Steve Grogan.     No, seriously, this situation differs quite a bit from the time Brady took over from Bledsoe. Bledsoe hadn't led them to 4 Super Bowls in the last 7 years (winning 3), setting scoring records along the way.     It's Brady's team, and everyone involved (Brady, Belichick, and most importantly, Cassel) knows it.     Now they can rest Brady some when they're blowing teams out, and not worry about Cassel giving the lead away.|`|DSJOxz0Qaa	It's not gonna matter.  I'm willing to project that a "healthy" Tom Brady, one year removed from reconstructive knee surgery will be equal to a second year Matt Cassel who went 11-5 in his first year starting since high school.  Therefore, in my mind it's a pick-um'.  Brady has a two year recovery period to return to 85% of the Tom we all know, that being said, I bet their record with him would be the same as with Matt as QB.|`|mTSOJKlyaa	kevin o connel|`|yLAH35rhaa	tom brady|`|Cy2pwXzzaa	Tom Brady without question.   he is ON schedule to start opening day - bad news for the rest of the league.

LUnscegvaa	Japanese Jiu-jitsu.    I'd suggest.    Best wishes :)***|`|GpzvrlHdaa	To defend in reality one must attempt at all times to remain standing.in order to skedaddle, 'cause you gotta skedaddle pronto!  Jiujitsu and judo tend to go to the ground, but it is very unsafe to do that.  Even the possibility of more than one attacker makes going to the ground too dangerous to contemplate.  Sometimes it may happen, but should be avoided.  Any of the traditional stand-up martial arts that contain basic grappling, and teach awareness as well as technique will be good for defence.  Again I must state that when choosing which martial art to join, find the best instructor, no matter the art involved.  The biggest difference between this martial art and that one is the ability of the instructor to teach.    .J|`|cEaODF8Raa	something i have seen taught in womens self defense classes is a good solid foot stomp,right on the bridge of the foot it should shatter bones if you do it right,along with a good strong KIIIAAAA!! right in the attackers face. the sound has great shock value and also will boost your strength a bit. fingers in the eyes works well too.|`|2baYnAokaa	they will all have benefits and weaknesses as you pointed out.  here is just a little to know:  1.  Okinawan karate-do (example: Shorin Ryu): art is about being defensive  and taking advantage of an attack.  it uses hits, kicks, locks, elbows, and throws.  it also works extensively on footwork for avoiding an attack.  if you look at this go to the Okinawan Prefecture homepage to make sure its legit.  2.  Japanese Karate tends to be more linear but still uses all the above.  3.  TKD (WTF) tends to be more strike and sport driven but still has many benefits.  4.  Judo (kodokan): called the "Soft art" but if a throw is used on a street you are dealing with major damage.  it is based on throwing or joint locks.  it is the base for most modern arts such as Krav Maga (founder was a Dan), SAMBO (russian art), BJJ (founder was a Dan), marine Martial art.    5.  Aikido (Aikidokai) "Way of harmony"  uses the opponent's attack against him.  It must be practiced with a willing partner as if a partner resists it will lead to permanent damage.  6.  Tai Jitsu used to be known as Jujutsu many modern forms exist some fall under other styles, originally from Japan  7.  Bujinkan Taijutsu (shinobi training), Japanese by origin may include toxicology and poisons, as wellas old weapons.  8.  Filipino Stick fighting (various styles)  many use sticks as well as defense against sticks.  techniques are transferable to blades or empty handed methods.  usually simple with many levels that build on itself.  will teach some grappleing and throws with sticks   there are so many more but you will get them here.  If I am mistaken I appologies to the practisioners of that art.  All arts have something to give you.  but remember that you are always held accountable for your actions, even if attacked you can go to jail if you over do it|`|AA11264943	The best one is the one that you can afford, that is closest to you to go train often with a teacher that you like and respect.    Any of those styles, including Judo, will help you with defending against a punch.    James|`|3DnX9NmAaa	No martial art is better than another. No martial art is more useful in modern day life than another. It all depends on the individual.    Even though Judo doesn't teach punches, then doesn't mean you're not allowed to use them in a real fight. Japanese Jujitsu would be good.     Brazilian Jujitsu is not good for street defense except against one person, even then it still has many weaknesses that I can point out. It's best left for competitions and sport.    Tae Kwon Do can be applied to real life. Though it too has it's weaknesses and is best left for sport.    Taijutsu isn't a martial art, it's a term for certain techniques. Taijutsu is Japanese for "body movement". All martial arts have and are Taijutsu.    Kung Fu (depending on the style) can be good. Most styles of Kung Fu tend to be more flashy than anything.    Karate (depending on the style) can be a very effective martial art.      As for your question about Judo. If someone grabs your neck, they have only a few seconds to let go before they end up slamming their head and shoulder onto the asphalt. Head vs. Asphalt... Asphalt tends to win.    You obviously have no martial arts training whatsoever. I suggest you find what styles are available in your area. You may love Karate, for example, but it won't do any good if you have no one to teach it to you. Find a good school that you like with a good teacher, and join.|`|KukyXRjpaa	honestly the best thing is called MMA, which is a combination of all martial arts.    The most notable style in mma, are;boxing, kickboxing,muay thai,wrestling, judo, and brazilan jiu jitsu.

V4itGcm2aa	It all started when vince appeared on monday night raw and monday nitro at the same time saying he had bought the WCW.

That fateful day in March 2001, when Vince McMahon made that announcement, that was when the WWE got screwed beyond repair.|`|Ifs306wMaa	It's sucked since it was first thought of|`|fU4b37pnaa	it did screw for up to 5-7 years or more so here's are the things why wwe did screwed up:  -harvey wippleman cheating to win the women's title in Jan. 2000  -eric bischoff became the gm of raw in 2002 after NWO broke up.  -kane ruined lita & matt hardy's relationship in 2004  -vince vs. stephanie match took place @ No Mercy 2003  -lita, torrie wilson, bobby lashley, rob van dam, taijri, ashley, ron simmons, kurt angle, mick foley, christian, goldberg, brock lesnar, rikishi, trish stratus & the rock were the main ones who left the company  -randy orton punting hbk, rvd, batista & mr mcmahon  -edge & vickie was in love with together & form 'la famila'  -The Cena Spinning WWE Title Belt was used for the past 4 years instead of the original WWE Title Belt  -Chris Jericho acting too mean and sadistic,sneaking to win the world title in championship scramble at Unforgiven 2008 & challenging Mickey Rourke @ WrestleMania 25  -Matt Hardy Costs his brother Jeff Hardy the WWE Championship at 2009 Royal Rumble  -Santino Marella hang out with Beth Phoenix  -stone cold steve austin join forces with vince mcmahon at the end of WM 17 in 2001.|`|AhO0Uoppaa	its always been screwed its fake and gay|`|7f2GSDmqaa	Everything pretty much from 2005 on has sucked|`|AA11570752	just after bobbie the brain Heanon left the show|`|qzW2Z5Fgaa	When they took away cruiserweight champion and when Paul London got released.It was better when you watch high flyers,because it was exciting.|`|Bp3bt5bCaa	When 7 year olds started watching|`|0esJ5Yfdaa	kane losing streak mvp lost losing streak to big show mattattude is back and edge wwe champ john cena whc and 1 man who mentally disturb no not kane undertaker  shane mcmahon kane tomb stoned his mother triple h  inperegrinated his sis and randy oron punted his dad and he think he can beat randy orton CR and TD|`|Y93pUmAGaa	well the attitude era was hands down the best timeframe in the WWE but i think things started to suck around after summer 2004 especailly when they started having storylines about shelton benjamen and his momma     same thing goes for womens division now instead of the clasic womens championship they made the divas championship for those untalented ones on smackdown !! ??? and divas used to have PUDDING MATCHES i want those good old days back ...     and they fired stacy kiebler and torie wilson . - worst move in sports entertainment right thur !|`|m6urEOTiaa	No offense, but it's a waste of time and money. It's not a good example for youth, and it's completely fake. It promotes violence, something we don't need.|`|l6g3moiEaa	Agreed, they have gone down quite a bit in quality lately. I mean... Shelton Benjamin's momma... DAMN. I've lost interest like you wouldn't believe, but I keep watching just in case something... SOMEthing... happens that I wasn't expecting. (Like Matt Hardy with the karaaaannng! off his brother's skull. Good stuff, brudda.) And I think they lost a lot of their way focusing on all the women's matches. I love to watch jiggling woman flesh as much as anyone, but I tune out when the Divas show up. The whole Diva Search from a couple years back? Lame. Maybe they shoulda paid Goldberg to stick around awhile.|`|qVuYGiF2aa	The wwe had been screwed up ever all the good people left like Stone Cold Steve Austin The Rock and Bret Hart quit and Kane got his mask off. Oh yeah its screwed now because every one cant act. The only  two people  who can act are the Undertaker and HBK.
8sthiustaa	A Sharks fan doesn't deserve to know.|`|O5Q4GP59aa	i think is "crowd chant" by joe satriani|`|3sRVdOVnaa	ITS CALLED "THIS IS L A"|`|AA11763656	Trick question!!!! Kings can't score goals!! j/k
cyECZWmwaa	HAHAHAHA at Unleash the ANIMAL's post! Batista, Jeff Hardy, Mic Skills? You've got 2 be kidding me.  Shelton's are better than both Batista's and Jeff Hardy's, YOU and a lot of other people just claim Sheltons Mic skills are crap because you hear someone else say it.  And i'm tired of hearing it.    THINK FOR YOURSELVES FOR ONCE PEOPLE~!|`|7f2GSDmqaa	They're pushing him now. I think right now is where he's supposed to be, finally.|`|Pne371ESaa	Of course he isnt being used to his full potentiol, WWE NEVER uses their wrestlers to thier full potential. I would love to see him leave WWE got to TNA start in the X Division win that title soon after starting then move on to the main event status and get in a HUGE Feud with AJ Styles. Those matches would be absolutely classic's like Rock vs. Austin was. they match up so well with each other.|`|d1c98d5f53bffe45427bed1d7f9cedb5aa	he doesn't get to show his full potential thats an understatement but his attitude is what got him to mid card status.he has improved his attitude and he is getting a bit further|`|XNbKc7Rzaa	Under-rated for years.  He's got a belt and he's had matches with Taker over last 2 weeks so i think they're pushing him a bit now.|`|OGPW7xZ2aa	ture her should be in the smackdown camber match for the wwe title at no way out next mouth|`|VuIxxJvqaa	I don't think Shelton is the complete package.    Yes, He is a brilliant athlete.  Yes, He has a tremendous physique.  He's young, He seems loyal, because he has stayed with the WWE     BUT!!    Have you heard him speak on the mic?     Look at all the WWE/WHC champs. They all have mic skills. Triple H, Jeff Hardy, Edge, Cena, Batista, etc area all capable of getting on the mic and getting the crowd going.    I mute the TV when Benjamin gets a mic.|`|gpBicBEPaa	Benjamin is one of the most underrated|`|h0z5S6BSaa	Yeah he's built|`|Y93pUmAGaa	this happened back in 2004 with him and triple h ... it deffanitly should happn again he is an amazing wrestler he is literally the WWE's aj styles|`|eDaty5gHaa	Give his us title to the new face m.v.p. and after backlash or j-day he can be in the wwe title mix|`|89fbcaca4c59414f87a5ed95ba7cc306aa	It's a possibility but I think he makes a good US champion, he could big the title up make it more prestigious.
MkUTWinPaa	Andre johnson cause he's a beast and indy D sucks  De Sean jackson has been great and that should be a high scoring game  Moss has had an extra week to get with cassel and that team needs him bad. cause the run will be stopped if moss cant spread the field  start those 3  welker is ok but you know they'll want to get their star going in moss  kc offense is too inconsistent|`|eknFVEZgaa	andre johnson.. hes playing indy and been lookin really good..    moss.. hes randy moss and they r playin SF    welker because its a PPR league
kwPTB15Paa	I can't wait to see CyberSnitsky. Best yet the could dress him up like RoboCop. That would be the best thing since Shockmaster or RoboCop in WCW. Knowing the WWE this would be a genuine idea, look at the Gobbledy Gooker.|`|7sa6B6Qhaa	One other idea people are throwing around due to an ominous voiceover "I'm Baaaack" in the video is Sid Vicious.  Apparently Vince has been in negotiations with Sid again, this could be some new gimmick for him.    I hope it's Jericho, though.  I doubt it's the Hard Foundation 2.0 because they've barely been in development for a year, and Teddy's a spot monkey with no real in-ring ability, so I'd think they'd train him to do better before putting him on the main roster.  Harry's great, and the newly alligned Dibiase's are supposed to be fairly good as well, although I haven't seen them in action.|`|8zTJVlEjaa	Y2J is back!|`|Pv7zDjGdaa	I to thought of the Hart Foundation v2.0 - 3 members all 2nd generation  222, it makes sense aswell.    But i think the WWE would be wise to choose Jericho otherwise this could be the ultimate insult to some fans...    I agree about getting excitied, because Vince could come to the ring and take a big dump in it and leave - It would still get a reaction from everyone.|`|Xb0cH8eBaa	If you play the video backwards, and listen closely, it is a faded version of Y2Js music.  Also Y2J has said he is coming back, we just don't know to who.listen closely at about12 seconds on a YouTube video it says I'm Back. If you look at some shots at the video it says October 7th all over it. No Mercy is on October 7th.|`|Q68rbu00aa	something to do with Chris Jericho. I hope :D
aw9cmcwxaa	yes he has hops  take advantage of that keep training him|`|tY3rZSsiaa	yea he has hops.|`|xbQZ6xXvaa	obviously|`|OZC2eFUQaa	well not necessarily if he can almost dunk then he has hops and that mean that he will be able to dunk by 5foot 8.|`|N3AiQRJFaa	My cousin is also 12 and he can touch the bottom part of net but he weighs 120 pounds and he is 5"3.

de6c3971f6ceca6dfa670abda1e852a8aa	Por lo que han hecho esta temporada falto por el Este Torkoglu de Orlando y en el Oeste Davis de Golden State  porque han tenido una muy buena temporada sin alardear al respecto.    Falto que Kobe estuviera en buen estado fisico, pero creo que si estaba lesionado debio dejar participar a otro jugador el ha ido a muchos juegos y a este fue solo por egoismo si jugo menos de tres minutos y no tomo ningun tiro.    Y de los que dan espectaculo falto Vince Carter y T-Mac que siempre que van al juego de las estrellas traen todo al juego no como Yao verlo jugar a veces es un poco aburrido pero nimodo no hicieron meritos esta temporada.|`|3b09793608a1fe9fb0ebd092e0007168aa	pues vi algo floj al oeste, les hizo mucha falta jugadores como kobe y t-mac que son estrellas que clavan el balon con autoridad.  Y el este dio un excelnte juego sobre todo al final estuvo muy emocionante.  Pues la verdad para mi fue una decepcion que no jugara kobe ni garnett .  Y creo que fue un desperdico que yao estuviera en cancha porque fue un cero a la izquierda.|`|UjWblu1Jaa	me parecio el juego feo de lo que haciendo este juego debio estar ginobili que ewse brandon roy mete mas punto encima la vuelca y el otro ni idea tuvo que estar tmac en ves de chris paul y jermaine onealc e n ves de west y si no fuero por lebron y howard el juego se iba a la aburricion me parecio el juego mas feo de los all stars game que se van haciendo hasta ahora|`|aGn2LxlOaa	Estubo bien .

Accessoirement il voulait peut-tre voir Yachvili en situation dans ce nouveau style mme si en l'occurrence il ne lui a sans doute pas fait un cadeau.|`|uzACqmANaa	Tu as totalement raison ! MAIS A 100% !  En fait nous avons un slectionneur de pro D2 qui slectionnent des joueurs de pro D2 ! Ils sont totalement  cot de la plaque avec leur jeunisme  tout va ! Regarder le finaliste de la dernire coupe du monde, euh ! L'angleterre je crois ! Avec des vieux ils sont alls en finale ! Faut arrter la casse ! Si on veut introduire des jeunes qui ne tiennent pas la longueur on les met rempla?ants.  Mignoni, Emmanuelli (tant mieux pour clermont qui les aura pour le top 14) Chabal (en 8 pas en 2eme ligne comme la pipe Laporte) Marconnet (qui est de retour) pour ne citer qu'eux sont tres bons et seront l dans 4 ans !   Notre mle s'est pris une dance contre les anglais car ils n'ont aucune exprience de l'internationnal, et contre les italiens ils vont se faire humilier ! On ne joue pas avec 3 novices en premire ligne, c'est le B A BA du rugby ! Mais Lievremont a le niveau pro D2 et on est parti pour 4 ans de dfaite ! Avec les 8 de Laporte, ?a fera 12 ans de gachis !  Prenez le goret comme selectionneur !!!|`|Yw41Yxxpaa	Mais non c'est pas incomprhensible! S'il y'a des rempla?ants sur le banc, c'est pas pour qu'ils regardent les autres jouer... Parra est sorti vers la fin du match, il fallait bien que Yachvili rentre et Parra devait tre crev parce que c'est clair qu'il s'est dfonc pour son premier match en temps que titulaire. Le but du coaching,  mon sens, c'est de faire rentrer du sang neuf, de l'nergie.|`|31dca8c7c1654b433de1002eaf3a53bdaa	changer le demi de mle pour changer la tactique de jeu. C'est parce qu'on a persist dans notre stratgie (qui ne marchait pas) qu'on a perdu la demi-finale de la CdM. Donc c'est logique. ?a n'a pas march non plus, mais on aura essay. Ce coup-ci on peut pas dire qu'on s'est born aux chandelles....on a mme voulu relancer de nos 22....pour finir sur un essai anglais certes, mais on aura essay.|`|4e7197cdbe29fe67b02cd6a50d931507aa	Pour son age, c'est clair...  Maintenant, cela a permis de voir que Yachvili etait vraiment pas le joueur du grand chelem 2004. Lent, mal inspire...    Quand a la rentre de Skrela, elle est mediocre vu la partition de son 9.    Je dirais que les shemas de jeu de Lievremont sont a revoir. 7 temps de jeu dans ses 22, contre les anglais, c'est du suicide.  En plus, se passer la babale c'est bien, mais creer un decalage, AVANT c'est mieux. Nos ailier ont vus seulement la ligne de touche.    Quand on sait que Balshaw ne ratrappe pas une gonfle a l'arriere, et que Vainikolo est tres mauvais dans le repalcement. En gros, en jouant derriere au pied, on leur aurait pose un max de probleme.    De plus, sur la plupart des phase defensives, le 3 rideau n'est forme que du 9 et du 15. On a eu tout faux, mais esperont que Lievremont retienne la lecon!|`|84f6e7ed6400ff1db723d55e3073fb4faa	Je pense que Livremont ne veut surtout pas "cramer" psychologiquement un jeune de 19 ans. C'est s?r qu' 19 ans il doit avoir les jambes pour 100 minutes ...  Je l'ai trouv ... prometteur... un peu trop lent dans l'jection mais avec des variations interessantes et le culot de sa jeunesse....  Alors quand il dit qu'il est exceptionnel c'est peut tre pour l'encourager et dire que s'il continu  travailler pour progresser on pourrait le revoir dans 4 ans en NZ......|`|4zcMc83Jaa	Bien sur que c'est incomprhensible, Perrin a fait la meme chose a Lyon contre Manchester en sortant Benzema.Il veulent les prserver au maximum en laissant le rsultats de cot.|`|KR4FDIudaa	Parra a fait un bon match, mais il a 19 ans et n'a pas forcment l'exprience d'un gars comme Yachvili pour terminer les matchs. Le coaching ne prend pas en compte que l'tat de fatigue du joueur, mais galement sa capacit  grer les fins de matchs. De plus, son rempla?ant Yachvili avait  mon avis plus d'exprience des grands rendez-vous. Malheureusement, cela n'a pas pay.    A mon avis Parra n'a pas t titularis parce qu'il tait le meilleur, mais plut?t parce qu'il faut commencer  prparer les prochaines chances internationales (Coupe du Monde 2011). Pour prparer cette gnration, il faut lui faire jouer des grands matchs ds maintenant.|`|YWDCBp5Laa	Para a fait un match exeptionnel en le sortant lievremont fait rentrer de l'experience pour tenter de gagner le match !!!|`|vlgGjFGzaa	C'tait planifi pour donner du temps de jeu  Yachvili.

Il a remarquablement bien jou, avec une audace et un sang froid trs tonnant pour son age et sa toute nouvelle exprience.

On situe l'origine de ces techniques en Angola, une ancienne colonie portugaise. Une forme trs analogue, aussi bien dans les gestes que dans les rythmes, est d'ailleurs connue et pratique dans tout l'ocan Indien sous le nom de Moringue depuis plusieurs sicles. La capoeira est un art martial qui utilise beaucoup les pieds car les mains des esclaves taient encha?nes. Au dbut, les mouvements taient trs proches du sol (copis sur les mouvements des animaux) mais avec l'arrive de peuples orientaux avec leurs propres techniques d'art martial, la capoeira a dvelopp les coups de pieds et de nombreuses acrobaties.                                    salut.........|`|HRyN9OIGaa	Comme disait le pote "Une main ouverte et un poing ferm, une pour conna?tre, l'autre pour cogner......"c'est un sport de combat......qui se danse encore CAPOEIRA!"|`|8bea082adce4edba1ede2a98f46ce302aa	tu as jamais jou  tekken ?? ^^    il s'agit bien d'un art martial    a la base, il tait pratiqu par les esclaves. En effet, ces derniers n'avaient pas le droit de se battre et ont donc trouv cette forme qu'ils faisaient passer pour de la danse.    d'ailleurs la capoeira n'existe pas sans l'accompagnement musical qui va avec. Quand tu apprends la capoeira, tu dois aussi connaitre les "chansons" qui vont avec ;-)

Nickster|`|qnpg8zBOaa	kaman would make more sense cuz the spurs need a better center    unless they want to put duncun in center, then elton brand in pf.    then they should definetly get brand|`|ZvdiIVONaa	ELTON Brand wiht out a doubt.  HE is very underrated.  One of the best defender and post scorers in the league.  He is better then Pau gasol..   hes really good.|`|ClQ9yJweaa	OMG, I have been saying for the longest time that I wished The Spurs had reached out for Kaman last season, and this season. He would be a perfect fit, being a true Center, something The Spurs desperately need. A Center that can score double digits and rebound as well. I like Brand but gets injured too often and I think has a huge contract with Clippers. If Kaman could be had, go get him Pop!|`|N3HvP6aRaa	Elton Brand ... more stable..|`|lx4mXdXHaa	Kaman, because he's more of a center and a shot blocker.    Brand is a Duncan type player.|`|YbefMzA2aa	elton|`|t8OiMMSYaa	Kaman is a better rebounder but Brand is a better post player, Kaman is a true center tho, something the Spurs lack|`|4KPWNWZIaa	Kaman's better for the Spurs.    He's a center who can block and rebound. He can intimidate with his size and defensive capabilities. He's not a talkative player like the rest of the Spurs. He seems very coachable and understands his role very well. He seems goofy but he's very productive and efficient when given his minutes.

(ce n'est pas l'quipe de 1998 ou de 2006)  D'autre part, tu vas bien vite en voyant les Pays-Bas en finale...lol (selon moi ils ne dpasseront pas les demies finales)  Belle soire.|`|rYQ1luUnaa	Ils vont mettre l'quipe rserve qui va perdre pour pas qu'il y ait des soup?ons|`|v91YTD7Yaa	Il peuvent aussi subir l'effet "Grce 2004" en pleine poire face  la Roumanie en finale ou avant    Et l, on pourra dire qu'ils "auront les boules", car les roumains peuvent tre trs dangereux, surtout face aux hollandais (cf. liminatoires de l'Euro)    Par contre je suis du mme avis que MARSEILLE DU 13...: il peuvent trs bien effacer les soup?ons" en perdant et en faisant comme s'ils avaient tout donn|`|YkXWIENgaa	Alors tout d'abord, les deux premiers du groupe C, s'ils gagnent tous les deux leur quart de finale, se retrouveront en demi-finale et non pas en finale...     Ensuite, les Pays-Bas ont une revanche  prendre auprs des Roumains qui leur ont chip la premire place de qualification.   Et enfin , vu comment ils ont jou leur deux premiers matchs, on voit bien que ce sont des gagnants, des durs, qui ne se contentent pas du minimum. Van Basten  la mi-temps contre la France, alors qu'ils mnent 1-0, au lieu de la jouer dfensif, il a fait rentrer Robben, un attaquant de plus!! Superbe choix! Moi j'admire!   On sent bien qu'ils veulent devenir champions d'Europe en battant tout le monde qui se prsentera sur leur chemin. Ils l'ont clairement dmontr en crasant l'Italie et la France et je crois qu'ils sont capables de le refaire si un des deux devait  nouveau se prsenter en demi ... Donc pour la Roumanie, oui il va faire jouer l'quipe B, mais l'quipe B hollandaise, c'est Van Persie et Robben entre autres, deux buteurs contre la France! Malgr la dfense Roumaine, je ne donne pas cher de leur peau... Bon courage  eux!|`|83052d3ab98c84fadccb6cf91a442b3eaa	Vos commentaires me font sourire car vous vous exprimez en supporteurs ... mais avant le fameux France - Italie, c'est l'autre match qui va dcider du sort du groupe.    1.  La Roumanie est l'quipe la plus forte du groupe, poussive, mais difficile  battre !  2.  Les roumains ne vont jamais prendre les buts encaisss par la France et l'Italie.  Remarquez que tous les buts hollandais ont ts marqus sur des fautes dfensives, ce que la roumains ne commettent pas !  3.  L'Hollande est surestime !    pronos :    PB- Roumanie 0-1  France - Italie 0-0|`|LIGCmwjTaa	pas besoin de match truqu, la france et l'italie vont faire match nul|`|D7OFstJzaa	Ils ne pourront rencontrer  nouveau la France, l'Italie ou la Roumanie qu'en 1/2 finale, et non en finale.

8QxVjXUxaa	RUGBY IS A GREAT SPORT, BETTER THAN ANY OTHER AND YOU KNOW IT...|`|yv0H7ve0aa	Rugby is tough, but not comparable to boxing or football, there is no mindless hitting,   yes the tackling is hard and you want a good defensive hit but the on field descisions and team work is what makes it interesting just as much as the rib breaking hits    i think its tough, in a gracefull way, its just simply amazing the game itself and the players who play it too.|`|1YdL04Jcaa	Boxing is incomparable to the other two (Even if you're the lippiest bastard on the field, chances are you won't get hit in the face more than once)    Rugby and football are as tough as each other (I played both - rugby for significantly longer) but the difference is that rugby is 40 minutes of game time, then a ten minute break, then 40 more minutes of game time.  You are expected to play 80 minutes and only get taken off the field if your game isnt up to scratch or you get injured.    The other thing is, there's a lot more broken play in rugby and improvisation plays a much bigger part.  The coach has no influence on the game once the players take the field.    My opinion, rugby and football are equal in toughness but rugby is harder to play well and you're more likely to get injured in football because of the stupid way they hit each other.|`|cG4cr236aa	having played american football for a while in the states and playind rugby at home i think rugby is tougher.a fella died in a collapsed scrum when i played rugby. would that happen if he was wearing loads of pads.so rugby is tougher.|`|JAicBUHAaa	Rugby is awesome, I would play it.

Because of the padding in American football, players use their bodies as weapons.  There are more serious injuries in football.    IMO, rugby is the most fun.  Football is all about stopping and planning, and coaches telling the players what to do each and every step of the way.  Rugby has continuous action so coaches have to shut up and let the players play.  Creatitivity in the middle of play replaces the preplanned execution of football.  Rugby is also much more of a conditioning challenge planted on top of the physical contact.|`|GpfrtMebaa	i think all these sports are exrtremely tough and the players need to stop comparing themselves to each other,    rugby football and boxing all take real men to play    i think boxing is very fun but probably not worthwhile doing as it has a negative impact on your image and can cause brain damage or worse, look at muhamad ali|`|ed561fad61b6d5b4cc9db29d9ed124c0aa	I've done all three but I love rugby. For one, rugby is a life sport. You can (and I do) play rugby into middle and even old age if you have enough other players to join you (I suppose you could do the others as well but there really isn't organization of the sport at those ages).    Boxing is the ultimate 1-on-1 sport. It requires endurance, speed, and strength.     Football requires less endurance and for most positions, more strength.    Rugby requires endurance and strength at all positions with sacrifice of strength for speed depending on position.    Rugby, to me, is the most fun. There's enjoyment on the pitch and off. No other sport that I know of compares in the camaraderie department.    I can't answer the question. "Tough" is how you define it. Is it tough to be able to take a punch in the head with a padded glove? Or is it tough to take/give a spear tackle even if you have pads on? Or is it tough to give it your all for 80 minutes for the sheer joy of moving an oddly shaped ball around a pitch?
RGEsfb5waa	Andrew Sheridan? he is  a near Olympic class weightlifter, as well as being a prop|`|fLCA6eDwaa	jerry collins... who knows really|`|pjhcHgpgaa	Carl Hayman looks pretty strong ...    The Bok forwards are huge...so I'd have to put a few of them up there....    If Andy Sheridan is near an Olympic weightlifter as another person has written then Carl Hayman would have won gold if he was lifting against Sheridan because he certainly had his number at scrum time...and I'm sure he'd have his number at weights too....|`|WfCiSaxJaa	Andrew Sherdian has the un-official reputation of being the strongest man in rugby, 1 RM's are : bench presse: 215 Kg, and squat : 275 Kg.   As mentioned above, Carl Heyman is also a colossal tower of strength too. Im not sure what his 1 RM for anything is, but i've seen a clip of him squatting 250 kg for a fair few reps.   However there are a few Tongans who rep 220! But obviously arent as high profile or well known as Sheridan or Heyman.   Austin Healey also wrote in a newspaper article that when he told Henry Tuilagi (his Leicester team mate) that Sheridan maxed out on the bench press at 250, Tuilagi loaded on 250 and repped it! The link to that is below.  However I don't think we will ever know who the strongest man in rugby is, as like already said, some people are better and stronger on certain exercises. It is too much of a generalised term, and to find out who is stongest on what it should be more specific e.g Strongest bench presser, Strongest sqautter etc|`|jfX3LkKFaa	Brad Thorn, who else.

srVQ1tTLaa	If you are going to get a Synergy stick, why are you thinking about using any other blade besides the synergy blade made for that shaft? It may be true that you can turn it upside down, but doing that changes the whole dynamics of the stick. The kick point will be different, the flex will be different, and so on. I don't know what the other answerer was talking about when they referred to heating up the stick will damage it. That is how you change the blades, is by heating up the shaft. Perhaps they were talking about using a torch to heat it. That is a definite no-no! Always use a heat gun. If you want to use regular blades, stick with a shaft that accepts regular blades. The Synergy shaft is really not that much better than any other shaft in that price range. It is more about personal preference, and feel.     Good luck.    Steve.|`|30wqZMaIaa	its true that you can do it.. most likely cut the bottom of the shaft and put a blade in it.. but heating the shaft up compromises strength and could cause it to break easily..     idk, the only time its worth doing is if you have one thats perfectly broken, or you find a shaft thats in good shape and you only use it for recreation.. i wouldnt use it in a game.
caTni82Qaa	10.  Release Smith because someone wants his jersey number.   9.  Release Smith because someone wants his locker.   8.  Release Smith because he can't run the triple option from gun in the NFL.   7.  Release Smith because it will free up a roster spot for a 3rd string long-snapper.   6.  Release Smith because Gruden needs a sixth string quarterback on the roster.   5.  Release Smith because he was drafted  1 because Matt Leinhart stayed at USC for a square-dancing class and a year later dropped down the draft boards and now he couldn't even start for the Arizona Cardinals over an aging Kurt Warner.  (Yeah, that means he's second choice to the second choice of a franchise that's probably never going to win a playoff game....ever.)   4.

Release Smith because you are a DIE hard niner fan, but you think you made a bad decision with Alex Smith, you were hopeful, but it was bound to happen...   2.

The 49ers bought the hype went Alex was at Utah, Alex was great QB at a mid major conference but Utah is not a great power in football, except for 1 year went Urban Myers brought the Spread option to Utah and just demolished the competition at that conference.

UJZZ4bnLaa	water boy      |`|TgBYy6HBaa	Seriously, it depends on the pool of talent that is around you.  It also depends on your ability with the ball, your physical ability, and your teams offense/defense.      If you're young, your coach may be able to see something in your football future that you don't fully understand and will place you accordingly.      Just because you're tall or fast or big or whatever doesn't mean you automatically fit a mold for a position.  I know 300lb running backs and 160lb offensive lineman.  It all depends on the team's plan, the talent pool you're a part of (aka who else is on the team), and your ability.|`|f117d61d770e7053ae217f019edc16b4aa	I would say Safety if you like to hit and you have good size and speed.

N7vYTiUAaa	they are the metal components that enable the urethane to spin faster than if it were just hooked up to the axle.    look at the pictures for the red things...those are bearings.|`|I8LnGpZyaa	they are the metal components that enable the urethane to spin faster than if it were just hooked up to the axle.|`|rJ71QT4baa	They make the wheels spin and there are different speeds also the cheapest are the abec 3's and i think the highest are 9's and they have to have two on each side of the wheel so there are 8 total
N7vYTiUAaa	there can be two reasons for this.  usually its either your trucks or your bearings.    bearings-check the bearings first by spinning the wheels individually. if it squeeks that your problem. (solution= popping them out and lubing them up. (oil works well))    trucks-specifically in the bushings, sometimes depending on the brand or tightness your truucks will squeak on your turns. (there isnt a real solution to this other than adjusting and tweaking the tightness(usually tighter)      if thats not your problem have someone from a local shop take a look at it or some other skaters.    it could also be your deck. if its cracked sometimes the ply's glue is bad and the friction in between them makes squeeks.|`|rJ71QT4baa	probably because you have spacers and the hardware is to tight|`|F4TiOSpvaa	well your bearings are probably lose or the trucks need to be tightened.....|`|SorA34Lhaa	Maybe the bearings need lubrication.|`|JnTAq0C4aa	usually it takes a minute to break it in.    did the shop put it together for you?    just skate it and it should stop after a while.    alien workshop is a good board. good luck

Nuj1eScCaa	In light of declining attendance at ARCO Arena, and also in light of the increasing obsolescence of the building compared to newer NBA venues, there was a campaign to build a new $600 million facility in downtown Sacramento, which was to be funded by a quarter cent sales tax increase over 15 years. In 2006, voters overwhelmingly rejected ballot measures Q and R, leading to the NBA publicly calling for a new arena to be built at another well-known Sacramento facility, Cal Expo, the site of California's state fair. Negotiations between the Cal Expo governing board and the NBA (serving on behalf of the Maloof family) are ongoing; the Cal Expo board is looking for improvements to the entire facility (including $40 million in deferred maintenance) as well as a new arena. The NBA promises that no public money will be used for the project; the Cal Expo board has long sought state legislation that would allow Cal Expo to form a joint-powers authority to issue bonds and lease land to developers, it is thought that negotiations for an NBA arena will more quickly bring this to fruition.    It has been rumored that the Kings may move to Las Vegas, Nevada, unless a new arena is built in Sacramento.    I really hope they don't move the team, all these teams need to stay put for a while lol.  |`|WCVUE6bGaa	dont know due they deserve it |`|AA12022283	I live near sac (about 30 minutes) and I havent heard anything about a new arena going up or the team moving.

Especially if our tax dollars will pay for it. Our property taxes and sales taxes are high enough. Unless private dollars are thrown into the total cost of a new arena, I will vote to not get a new arena.|`|oaGIgZtjaa	Plans are in the works and have already been approved to build one in Cal Expo, with both the tax payers and the Maloofs paying for it.

3cR5oPcFaa	the ppl choosing the homecoming dance over the game are ridiculious ad totaly not motivated i hope they realize that and it seriously is hurting their chances of making the team next yr since the coach knows their not motivated make sure they know that and start NOW get the jv ppl who are stepping up start practicing with u and have 1 day where u get all the ppl who will be playing during that game and have a bonding dont talk about vball just connect and have a good time as friends it may sounds usless but a good team plays as 1 and u cant do that if u dont even know ur team mates good luck!!
FSoh5bOWaa	Well, this is rather a tough situation. First thing you have to do, though, is get the rest of your team to believe that you can succeed as much as you do! Maybe you can look back on stats and point out things that the players have done good on in the past. This will boost their confidence. Also, you can try to get everyone together and spend personal time together out of practice, like a Haunted House or something (since Halloween is coming up) Or, you guys can go shopping for homecoming dresses. Try to be as nice to your teammates as possible and get everyone to work together by exciting them and reminding them how good it would feel to win against these notoriously good teams. I have known those tactics to help in the past. Though, I'm only in eighth grade, and Jr. High vollleyball teams are different than JV teams! Anyways,    hope this helped.    Sincerely, "Zuko"|`|YsgOIV2Baa	Maybe have a party just for the people that are playing and just hang! You know bond!  Maybe practice alot with them and make good plays and shake their hand when the make a bad play or do some cheers after every play...different ones!! Have Fun

f3p5ItM6aa	Try a Stevens Model 200 by Savage Arms msrp $346. It comes in a host of calibers. I have the 30-06 and it shoots great. Capacity 4+1 in bolt action. Add a great budget scope from vortex crossfie msrp $149 a vortex crossfire 3-9. At this point you don't need an expensive scope you'll never use. Go to guns and ammo for the review or type in the gun in google search and read some reviews. I bought the same gun and it works great. Total about $500 or less depending on where u get it. Do some research, you won't be disappointed. Have fun.|`|LWzrCu5caa	Unless you hunt in an area where the wind is always from the same direction,  I would get some good scent block.   Game can smell you coming and with changing winds,  scent block is the only way to get close.     The best all around gun for the USA is a 30-06... Depending upon the ammo, you can use it for coyotes up to mule deer and small bears.   I would recommend you go to the various gun stores in your area.  Look for a good bolt action rifle.  Used is OK as long as you check the barrel with a barrel light to make sure the rifling is not worn out and the barrel is not pitted.    An honest gun store can save you a lot of problems.   They know that if they deal well with you, you will come back for your second gun, your third gun...    If you want to start with small game,  a Remington Nylon in 22 caliber is an excellent gun if you can find one.  $200 or less.   Good for small game like squirrels,  ground hogs,  coons,  etc.       If you are going to put a scope on the gun, do not go cheap on the scope....If you can not see the game then the quality of the gun does not matter.   I have a $1700 Swarovski scope (3-12 x 56) on a $2000 Heym rifle.   I can reach out and touch something at 500 meters...    And by the way,  if you want a semi-auto that in any way, shape or form could be called an assault rifle, you had better buy it before Obama swears in....  He is going to make a Presidential Order which will re-institute the Assault Weapon Ban,  naming a lot of common hunting rifles as "evil."   |`|OOPPTQuVaa	100 dollars or 100 male deer? No really, it really doesn't matter as long as its camouflage, if your hunting after christmas( depending on were you live), I'd recomend some of that white camouflage that looks like snow. And if its your first time hunting you probably dont know that it gets really cold if your hunting up north. So buy hand and feet warmers. I'm not sure about the gun, but it really shouldn;t matter.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	What are you going to hunt ?
9f7c3a6b1c85a2b25fdaadcc6f4cc32aaa	I dont think they can get him. First thing they would need to do is get him to waive his no trade and so far he has shown no inclination to pitch in the AL. And he knows about smaller parks in the AL and the pressure he would be under to post numbers like he had pitching in the grand canyon of all ballparks in SD. Plus the Braves nad Cubs both have offered incredible packages for him and still no deal, the Yankees would have to part with a serious amount of their young talent and they would have to give up at least 2 young elite pitching prospects. The Padres wont have much interest in arbitration eligible guys like Cabrera or Cano (guys said to be potential peices of an offer) or a high salary guy like Matsui (yet another rumor). It would be have to likely include at least Hughes, Melencon or Kennedy and either Tabata or Gardner. That is a huge amount of talent and keep in mind the Braves offered a package pretty close to this and no deal. |`|e8998d8c8bdf12a545b0dfe2fd77052caa	none.  yanks send cano, hughes, chamberlain. minor league prospect jackson forpeavy.  the yankees never trade a good player in any deal.|`|5FAW64vGaa	They could, I mean they have all the money.peavy is interested in a national league team contract,like the cubs maybe.if he would go to a American league team, the Anaheim angels have the upper hand.|`|tq5vKKWzaa	No chance. The Padres are looking for GOOD prospects, and everyone has seen the Yanks farm system. It kind of blows. With the contract they're offering CC, they can't afford the fire sale of the farm system to get a stud like Peavy. Even without the farm, they'd be in the hole about 9 mill a year on Peavy alone, not to mention the 22.5 mill on CC. At their ages, shelling out that much isn't worth it. Just my opinion|`|D8OzQwXKaa	they might not get him if they get lowe, burnett or sabathia. plus peavy has said he likes the NL better|`|AA10425091	Not sure how he fits with the Yankees|`|UC27b06uaa	ya...im not sure|`|AA11264854	with the money they are shoving at CC i say slim and none|`|jIFVydfdaa	slim to none. thats what MLB.com said yesterday.|`|kyEPS7xCaa	I think the Yanks are keeping their options open in case they do not get any of their other choices.  That includes, CC, Lowe, and Burnett.  They are appearing (and actually are) desperate for some starting pitching, so they want to be involved in all talks when it comes to aces.    With Peavy, they would have to give some young guys up, and I would say that included Hughes and someone like Melky or Jackson (which would be VERY bad choice if you ask me).  Yankees need to keep their system fresh, and Peavy isn't worth it.  Actually, none of these guys are worth the price Yanks are offereing.|`|AA11725144	obviously they will get him cuz they cant raise any good players on their own|`|llZxFbn3aa	rare!  cc is a fortune!  and u should be happy they get him even though peavy is amazing but cc on the yankess would be fanominal.  most likely hell go to the cubs|`|bR5myhajaa	Peavy's list is much too small. the braves are out so the other teams can be stingy in their trade. The yankees would have no use for peavey unless they fail on Burnett and Lowe.

I'll never understand how they release this game each year and Dwight Howard averages 14 and 8. Yao averages 11 and 8. It's unthinkable. This year, they actually released a patch that made the stats in the franchise worse! It's totally inexcusable. I find the gameplay (with the right sliders) to be nearly perfect, but I'd like to run a franny with some realistic outcomes.     By the way, create-a-jersey sounds awesome. Madden had that, where you can edit or create a new jersey for your team. That's hot. FIBA would be nice too.|`|I2I843Myaa	Harder to score, both you and the other team can easily score every possession. Also, it's not under their power, but I really wish Jordan would let 2k put him on the 90's all stars. Also, it would be cool if you could intentionally do hard fouls (at the risk of a flagrant, of course.)|`|P93I8CHtaa	i want them to bring back the fix your crib thing,they had it on 2K6,they dont have it no more on 2k7-9|`|EWyo1nmBaa	I'd also add in better dribbling, overall controls, better online matching (such as searching for a certain user to play against).

vIrAyfGvaa	It wasn't dirty, because it wasn't intentional, However it does warrant him being suspended if you follow the letter of the law. His foul was not committed with malice but did have excessive body contact of a "non-basketball" nature that resulted in a player injury    RULE No. 12 FLAGRANT FOULS:    Section IV--Flagrant Foul   a. If contact committed against a player, with or without the ball, is interpreted to be unnecessary, a flagrant foul--penalty (1) will be assessed. A personal foul is charged to the offender and a team foul is charged to the team.   PENALTY: (1) Two free throws shall be attempted and the ball awarded to the offended team on either side of the court at the free throw line extended. (2) If the offended player is injured and unable to attempt his free throws, the opposing coach will select any player from the bench to attempt the free throws. (3) This substitute may not be replaced until the ball is legally touched by a player on the court. (EXCEPTION: Rule 3--Section V--e.) (4) The injured player may not return to the game. (5) A player will be ejected if he commits two flagrant fouls in the same game.   b. If contact committed against a player, with or without the ball, is interpret-ed to be unnecessary and excessive, a flagrant foul--penalty (2) will be assessed. A personal foul is charged to the offender and a team foul is charged to the team.   PENALTY: (1) Two free throws shall be attempted and the ball awarded to the offended team on either side of the court at the free throw line extended. (2) If the offended player is injured and unable to attempt his free throws, his coach will select a substitute and any player from the team is eligible to attempt the free throws. (3) This substitute may not be replaced until the ball is legally touched by a player on the court. EXCEPTION: Rule 3--Section V--e. (4) The injured player may return to the game at any time after the free throws are attempted. (5) This is an unsports-manlike act and the offender is ejected.   c. A flagrant foul may be assessed whether the ball is dead or alive.|`|Xbid2OG8aa	i am a big fan of bobcats   but you could tell he didnt mean to do that to him  he was just playing hard defense  bobcats just got unlucky with that injury    DJ AUGUSTIN ROCKS  GO BOBCATS|`|3teWTOPqaa	I don't think Andrew is a dirty player, but he didn't think on that play.|`|Mn97YDIyaa	I don't think it was a dirty play, but Bynum just wasn't thinking. He went elbow first and that is NOT going for the ball. He should be fined, but nothing more. He didn't mean to fracture Gerald's rib and make his lung collapse, and I'm sure the last thing he wanted was to injure him. I don't think this is worthy of a suspension, but he needs to be punished somehow.|`|2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	It wasn't dirty, just stupid.|`|WLXFAeSnaa	I think it was a dirty play. The NBA should suspend him for two weeks.|`|dXblgZEzaa	No I don't think he was trying to go that far.|`|caAuJJwGaa	How can people be seriously implicating Gerald was at fault in any way here?  He may a hard drive to the basket, down SPACE that had opened up in the lane.  Bynum cut quickly across to fill that space but being caught out of position, stuck his arms out to grab Wallace and prevent an easy layup.  But instead of reaching out with his left arm, he turned his right shoulder and reached across with his elbow rather than an outstretched arm.  He had less reach from that position using his right arm rather than his left, and then shortened it even further by leading with the elbow.  Interesting that the Lakers were down 5 at the time...would he have made a similar play if they were up by the same score?    I think it was a dirty play, but I don't think the intent was as bad as what the injury has turned out to be.  I would think a 1-2 game suspension would be as harsh a penalty as could be handed out, particularly given Bynum has no history of such play.|`|tBuzrlSdaa	He didnt try to do that hard foul|`|45e71bc8ca903cd0b9c0e4294eff6f04aa	i remember that play and g wallace went to the basket so hard and so fast and had no regard for himself and he hit a brick wall when bynum went to stop him. g wallace always gets himself into hard collisions. hes just reckless|`|8sthiustaa	It was dirty, but it deserves nothing more than the flagrant they already handed out.|`|XohmRwiKaa	It was not an intentional foul. It was a hard foul though    From looking at the replay, i think he was just out of position, and wanted to stop wallace from an easy basket, He was too far, so all he did was reach his long arms out, and inadvertently elbow wallace in the ribcage|`|PvpbooLXaa	I think that was reckless by Gerald but also Bynum shouldn't have gone elbow first and I know Bynum didn't want to hurt G Wallace but you know things happen and I hope Gerald Wallace recovers quickly but B ynum should be fined a small amount and  get suspended as it was not intentional but remember Horford and TJ Ford I think 1-2 games is reasonable|`|mG2BCZe7aa	Wasn't known as dirty player, his elbow was just caught on the middle of Gerald's rib cage, it wasn't intentional at all. Looking at the replays you can see that Gerald have beat him on the jump so the only way he could defend was to put his arms up unfortunately Wallace was just to fast and that caused the nasty foul.      Hope this helps.|`|ZncrpxaXaa	I don't think so. Bynum is not a dirty player.  He just tries do prevent the basketball fom going in, and he made a mistake.|`|j29eHSDqaa	It was just a "Hard Foul"... that's all.      Just remember Karl Malone and his elbows.!!!          -------------------------------------

ABoo1doVaa	To the poster a couple above me, if there were a 4 team playoff, USC would have been included, probably over Alabama.    Personally I would like an 8 team playoff. It would insure that the top 4 teams would be included. As for the current system, it is biased against the big ten and big 12. Two of the bowls are in SEC territory, and the rose bowl is 11 miles from the USC campus. Anyone who doesn't think that is an advantage doesn't know football. That's why I am against a plus one, or having a playoff with the current bowls, which are never a home game for the big ten, or big east. It should be the higher ranked team gets home field.|`|4kdlE54Paa	They need a playoff system period.    Thumbs up to those who agree.|`|rNUyV1EYaa	I think a playoff of some sort is needed; perhaps among the number one through sixth ranked teams.

He would need to go to a more regular team to get a championship.    That said, I don't think he has a whole lot of time left. His numbers are down all around.|`|N3AiQRJFaa	I think it is too late for him to win unless he changes team makes his own salary less and go to a good team.|`|3teWTOPqaa	Yeah, but I don't think it's going to happen with the Suns though.
JV8lgDRCaa	uhh mmm.. ok ill go for   new jersey vs utah in the finals but the nets will win it.|`|mff1vstNaa	hmmm lol good question. I say Utah would win it all since they are supposed to be a playoff team. Portland has a good chance, but not as good as Utah. New Jersey goes to the finals for the east, but Utah is too good for them. Only reason why Utah isn't in the playoff picture right now is the injuries.|`|75nQwsVPaa	i think it would end up being Utah vs. New Jersey in the finals with the Jazz winning it all.  reason: N.J. is doing a lot better than what people expected (or at least that's what i think) and Utah will be getting Boozer back soon so they'll be a power house once again.  And then in the finals, everyone knows the Jazz are way better than the Nets.|`|KdhNCnEjaa	Im taking the Pacers to win it all over the Clippers    hahahhaha|`|H7AcXAyaaa	Be awesome|`|vzYJJCdqaa	I WOULD BE SOO HAPPY!!|`|tBuzrlSdaa	Probably Toronto vs, Utah  Utah wins 4-2|`|2dgVkcVAaa	Final would be Portland vs Nets.

4TgxrCX4aa	The question is why the Cubs are interested in having Heilman (or Olson for that matter). The rotation is probably the most solid piece of the Cubs team with Zambrano, Lilly, and Dempster as a dependable 1-2-3 and Harden as a great 4 when healthy. As for fifth or a spot starter, Marshall or other pitchers in the organization could more than handle those roles as well as Heilman or Olson. Why aren't the Cubs focusing on more pressing needs like relievers or some left-handed bats?|`|B5BWocvZaa	how could they trade garret olson after we just gave him to them. this is the reason everybody hates the cubs|`|IE9L6B9Aaa	Aaron Heilman is a pretty good pitcher...BUT was he really worth Ronny Cedeno AND ummm the other guy?! no. I'm not sure if Heilman is a submarine pitcher or not but I  do know that he is not no starter. Unless the Mets were lacking a reliever than I guess on SOME basis the trade was smart. I mean I guess getting rid of two contracts for one is more financially inept. but still...|`|tx9BzBWraa	All I can say is as a Mets fan, good luck Cubs! Heilman's okay I think NY was too much for him but he could rebound, And he's a 3/4 pitcher not submarine|`|d9755b1afe952617603d01f2e4c6acb1aa	bad trade|`|Ar5VHDiBaa	I can understand dealing Cedeno.... how many 2nd basemen does one team need? BUT, Heilman? I think I'm going to get sick!|`|iz5zDFxvaa	It only means that they are getting closer and closer to trading for Peavy|`|FfIqGrdkaa	Eh Halimen has potentional. If the Cubs coaching staff can tap into it, it is deffenitaly worth it.|`|V03f8tmMaa	I think its a good trade for the Cubs i mean i know they arnt gonna get peavy so might as well try to trade for some 5th starter compition to go along with Sean Marshall and some other guys that are going for it

They could probably do another 100 after that. Their a good team just can't win in the big show. But I think they will eventually win a World Series in  their existence.|`|V25THlPKaa	Repeat what?  Not winning the WS?  Then, yes.|`|iz5zDFxvaa	What? Failing to reach and win the World Series? Yes, it's possible|`|WaaFCtuOaa	Repeat what? Winning division, losing in play offs or having to wait another year for a shot at a WS|`|2wgEsVmsaa	Yes. . .that's a given. Now can they WIN?|`|4TgxrCX4aa	None of the other teams in the division have made any significant improvements or additions over the offseason with Milwaukee losing a major reason for their late season success, so the Cubs should easily win the NL Central again.  That said, both the Brewers and Cardinals showed last year that they can't be counted out and one of those teams could give Chicago a run for the title, but I doubt it.  The great thing about the playoffs is the team can't do any worse than last year if they make it.  Expect the worst and you'll never be disappointed.|`|53f6d1583a398f12926f5f4f58e581d5aa	I Answer the questions the way I want to. I can't reduce my answers to a yes or a no.

Probably|`|VxsdWmevaa	They play in the comedy central. They win the NL Central by default, kinda like the Minnesota Vikings won the NFC North this year. However, the Cubs media and fans put ridiculous pressure on themselves to win it all. The Cubs are under new ownership and will go one and done. again.|`|PSMsDalLaa	?    YES! they will lose in 4 in the first round.|`|ak5A435maa	repeat what?|`|oyq0vrWNaa	Yes, they will not win the World Series.|`|c6q3EERdaa	They will not win the World Series... for the 101st year in a row. If that's what you mean by repeat, then the answer is yes.|`|gwUq6HMUaa	They will repeat winning the NL Central, but they won't win the World Series.|`|PJF4J3iYaa	will they win the nl central? yes  will they lose in the first round? no  will they win the world series? no|`|5xIroQjMaa	The Cubs will certainly lose once more. Maybe Zambrano will finally get sick of being a loser, and demand a trade to a real team where his Hall of Fame career can truly take off. It's always sad to see a bright talent get bogged down by the ineptitude of failure. Carlos needs to look at Mattingly, and realize that could be him struggling to get into the Hall, regardless of his accomplishments, all because he played on a horrible team all his career.|`|u1T5TQP7aa	lets put it this way, they will, either the division or wild card and by repeat i hope you mean YES or NO to another sweep in the NLDS, and in that case no

xqPRS6Buaa	it depends on what things youre good at. like catching and throwing.  if you have a strong throwing arm and can at least run fast, outfield would be a good place to start.    if not, i would recommend short stop or third base.  long distance throwing isnt required and neither is a lot of running. 3rd base isnt as nerve racking as first and second.  ive played first, second, and third at different points and as for beginners, i would definetly recommend trying third if you're not comfortable in the outfield.|`|vxTcvSYdaa	Probably start in outfield, left or right. Generally, left field gets more balls. You could also tell the coach that you haven't played for a while, and she or he will help you find a position.    I started playing freshman year, in left field, and now i'm playing center field and 3rd base! =D    moral of the short story: you coach will be able to follow your progress and move you as your ready. have confidence in yourself!|`|T5UBrKZjaa	For your age group, most likely the school coach, is going to look for basic fundamentals. How well you catch, how well you throw, how well you hit.    Work on these three topics....need some tutoring...go to sportskool.com. Coach Mike Candrea (Coach@ University of Arizona as well as, USA Olympic Gold Medal Coach has made FREE videos that you can watch on line.     Coach Candrea is the authority on women's softball. If he says something...trust me...he is correct. His record backs up his words. You will get a lot of advice from people on this blog but none better than his.    Work on your hitting, throwing and fielding. When you go down to your tryout...do those things correctly and you'll make the team. Once your on the team, let your coach worry about where to play you. Take that attitude and you will go far.    Good Luck|`|s4VzPulYaa	It really depends on your streangths and weaknesses, if you are good at gounders, infield and outfield will be great, if you are fast, shortstop would be an excelent place, if you are quick to react, 3rd base is probably a good spot for you to be. If you have great depth perception and are quick, outfield is a great place to be, if you have a good arm, outfield is defananly a great spot.|`|AA10025824	Outfield, but practice a lot and put 100% into it.  Also, try pitching.  It's difficult but once you get the hang of it you may be great.  One thing any team will always need is someone who can pitch.|`|AA10349169	Right Field
4TgxrCX4aa	On the first day of school a first grade teacher explains to her class that she is a White Sox fan. She asks her students to raise their hands if they, too, are White Sox fans.  Wanting to impress their teacher, everyone in the class raises their hand except one little girl.  The teacher looks at the girl with surprise and says, "Janie, why didn't you raise your hand?"  "Because I'm not a White Sox fan," she replied.  The teacher, still shocked, asked, "Well, if you are not a White Sox fan, then who are you a fan of?"  "I am a Cubs fan, and proud of it," Janie replied.  The teacher could not believe her ears. "Janie, why pray tell are you a Cubs fan?"  "Because my mom is a Cubs fan, and my dad is Cubs fan, so I'm a Cubs fan too!"  "Well," said the teacher in a obviously annoyed tone, "that is no reason for you to be a Cubs fan. You don't have to be just like your parents all of the time. What if your mom was a hooker and your dad was a drug addict, what would you be then?"  "Then," Janie smiled, "I'd be a White Sox fan."    Any parallels drawn between sox fans and prison time are also acceptable (like, "I hear they moved the Sox rally to (insert name of nearest jail) to make it more convenient for fans")    You could also point out that the Cubs have won 16 pennants to the Sox's 6 or that the Cubs have gone .514 all-time with 10,082 wins while the Sox are 8 points back at .506 with a mere 8,461 wins.    But really you can't get too complicated or use big words when you say these things, most Sox fans dropped out of school so they might not understand you.|`|AA10349169	This question is so dumb, that even a White Sox fan will answer it|`|e3aZsDqwaa	yo man i have a good one.....           your so stupid that your a white sox fan           your so fat your a white sox fan           your so poor your a white sox fan|`|t8eclWGXaa	hahaha, Obama likes the White Sox|`|0Pd6INebaa	You could say that the white sox are so dumb that they sold away the 1917 World Series but that might be kind of dumb|`|6T90F8mNaa	Seriously? That's the same thing as me, except Cubs fans do that. That definately is not a true Sox fan.    Maybe bring up the 1919 Black Sox Scandal. If he doesn't care, because it's actually fascinating, he isn't a true fan, simple as that.    Then you can bug him about being an untrue fan.    Why I answered this, I do not know. But I felt like the possibility of helping a Sox fan become a true fan someday and appreciate the history is good.

cGOBkGwwaa	Philadelphia fans are the absolute greatest. If people are not phillies fans, then they will say the mets because they have no real concept of what a "real" fan is. They just don't get it. Yeah, we do get a little nasty when a player is doing somethin stupid...but hello...if we didnt get pissed off it would mean we don't care. And TRUST me...we care. I'm not saying we don't get bandwagon jumpers...every team gets them, but the true philadelphia phans are the best. Just listen to one of the greatest phillies of all time...  "They read their sports pages, know their statistics and either root like hell or boo our butts off. I love it. Give me vocal fans, pro or con, over the tourist types who show up in Houston or Montreal and just sit there."   -Mike Schmidt    And like Jimmy Rollins said to the phans during the WS parade..."We felt the heat, we came to the ballpark some days and you gave us the business... and there were definitely days when you put us on your backs and carried us through"    Phillies fans win...hands down. I made up this quote one day when someone aggrevated me sayin about how philly fans suck and i love it...  "people always say how they hate philly fans, they say we're crazy and obnoxious. But i say...ppl just hate us bc we're more dedicated than they will ever be. We're crazy about the game, and what others call obnoxious, we call passion."|`|gVYfFSpRaa	That's a dangerous question, and you're looking to start an argument.|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	Mets|`|5xIroQjMaa	Neither.

69b4203311a371eab3d1c0ebf526270caa	Well, I could see him getting in for these reasons:  All-Time Leader in Home Runs by a Second Basemen  1,500 RBI's  1 MVP  560 Doubles    But there's reasons you wouldn't see him in because of things like he wasn't the best second baseman in the majors for just about all of his career and has topped 100 runs only three times in his career.    I know that he isn't a first balloter. I think he will have to wait, but he should probably get honored for his longevity, and the fact that he wasn't a slouch at second base, while putting up stellar numbers. I think he'll be in the Hall as a San Fransico Giant because how long he was there, but not right away.|`|tvy8qFKCaa	You can read my answer on any one of the other 529 times this has been asked the past week.    Hope this helps.|`|YPQTXOQ5aa	I think that Kent is a Hall of Famer, He was the one of the best 2nd baseman from an offensive standpoint to ever play the game.     I think he will go in as a Giant, but who knows|`|AA10025824	I think he will.  Not first ballot or anything but he'll make it in and he'll go as a Giant.|`|d9755b1afe952617603d01f2e4c6acb1aa	HOFer as a Giant!!|`|AA10349169	For sure, and as a Giant|`|eac78f41a64d286478c23785cf30be23aa	I think he's in and deserves to be in.    A lot of people will compare his numbers to other "fringe" guys like Steve Garvey, but Kent happens to be the All-Time HR leader at his position...fair or not, that puts him a notch above guys who where "great" OFs and corner infielders...but not "All Time" greats.    He also happens to be in the Top 50 or Top 100 All-Time in a number of other categories, and while his defense was never spectacular, it was consistently good and no team ever had to let him finish his career as a DH or 1B.    Hard to say as a Dodger fan, but Kent should go into the hall as a Giant because that is where he had his best years and emerged as a HOF'er.  I just wish they'd have an engraving of him with his hands wrapped around Bonds' neck instead of just his face...|`|sHXazyDWaa	He'll probably be one of those Jim Rice type of guys. They have similar stats, although Kent's are better since he's played a lot longer than Rice. I bet that the earliest Kent will get into the HOF will be his 3rd ballot, but I bet he'll get elected during his 15 years of eligibility.|`|42f3d6d73c3972f622efbb1789221c0baa	He is and I think he will go in as a Giant.|`|0Pd6INebaa	I think Kent will get in. He was probably one of the best second basemen the league has seen, and he will get in under the Giants. I think that he was one the first really good all around second basemen.|`|a51AvQrlaa	CONGRATULATIONS!!!  you just won the badge for stupidest question of the baseball section!!!

1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	Cody Rhodes will never surpass, or even equal, his father's career, nor will he ever be as famous, or considered a "legend" as Dusty Rhodes is.  But the Rhodes name got him a break and allowed him to get into the WWE and on TV sooner than he really should have.  Ted Dibiase Jr probably won't surpass his father's career, either.  David Sammartino didn't.  Neither will David Flair.    Bret Hart far surpassed his father's career, as did Curt Hennig and Eddie Guerrero.    Pro wrestling is a cut-throat business, with thousands of wrestlers (and hopefuls) wanting to get in to the WWE.  Having a famous father is a double-edged sword.  The name opens doors, but you have a lot to live up to.  The name DOES opens doors, though.  So yeah, they should use every advantage they have to get noticed.  It's up to them to make something of themselves after their father's name opened the door for them.  If the son or daughter fails, THEY fail; their parents' name, reputation, and legacy remain intact.|`|6Ro48ZhMaa	goldust did not infact for a while when cody Rhodes his real life half brother was younger he did not even know who he was|`|IWPeq2sfaa	i guess, i mean with the same last name they will always be like measured to how there parent wrestled. so they wont look as good b/c most famous wrestler kids that wrestle can't...hint hint Cody Rhodes i hate him.|`|fV9SawuPaa	Yes and no. Anyone who sees the last name "hogan", "hart", or "flair" will jump up in excitement. It catches the viewers attention and makes the new wrestler instantly watchable. Unfortunately, if the wrestler is any short of impressive, using their parents' name has just screwed them. They'll be forever looked at as "not good enough". So when using your parents name be careful, especially when it's your ring name. It can either make you or break you.|`|BAurzDXtaa	I think so because people see their famous last name and expect way too much from them when they will probably never surpass their parents accomplishments. If they go by their own name everything that they obtain will be because they earned it and nobody could say that it was just because of who their parents are.|`|E7TkNO00aa	I think that the children wrestlers should go under a different name and start their own wrestling career and become famous for who they are and not for who their daddy or mommy is/was. Thank you.|`|7f2GSDmqaa	They should go by different names to stay out of their fathers shadow. Its very hard to have success when your father is a famous pro wrestler.|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	Depends, some it would not matter. In some cases it has ruined careers because people expect to much.|`|T13xM9iJaa	Well so time it helps and some times it hurts.

1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	He's a bit on the small side and most smaller wrestlers don't do very well in the WWE where they love the giants.  The smaller guys, no matter how talented they are, usually end up making the big guys look good (Jamie Noble, perfect example).<br>  <br>  Rey Mysterio proved that the smaller guys can make it big, with the right gimmick.  Evan Bourne got over on his awesome talent and aerial abilities, but he's an exception.<br>  <br>  Tyson Kidd is an excellent performer, but so are a lot of the smaller guys in the WWE.  To really make it big he's going to need a gimmick that clicks with the fans.  And be able to do interesting promos.<br>  <br>  The potential is there.  It's up to the WWE to find the right gimmick for him.  If they do, he's got a very good future with the WWE.  Otherwise, when (if) he moves to RAW or Smackdown he will probably find himself making less-talented big guys look good while he stares up at the lights, flat on his back time and time again.|`|WyPOnZdSaa	I Wish He Kept His Old Name T.J Wilson That Was Way Better Than The One He Has Now, His Future I Believe He Might Have A Future In RAW IF He Gets Drafted Or In Another Case Stay With ECW, He Has Great Skills In The Ring, Hes Future Really Depends On McMahon Supporting Him.|`|UDqMdvESaa	Only if he gets rid of his stupid name <br>  I'm not cheering or booing anyone with the last name Kidd|`|AA11435718	God I hope not that all we need|`|dOFVXmV2aa	He got a great tecnichal and <br>  highflyer moves.<br>  He has future but that depends on Vince Mc Mahon.<br>  If this is not produces money doesn't work.|`|L6dtQKIBaa	Yes, I do actually, and he has a great valet.

I'm not sure I want another slasher guard on this team.      And for everyone who says this is soooo one-sided, you are forgetting about the fact that Snow and Wally's contracts are expiring, thus giving the team who takes them on an additional $20 mill cap room this offseason.|`|zGJRYi5Eaa	wow your gay that never even happened and never will|`|PjFLDSmdaa	Hmm...not a bad trade.    But I don't think the cavs should do ANYTHING. They're playing amazing right now and the team chemistry has never been stronger. It only takes losing (or some cases gaining) one player to ruin that. I think they should just go hide in a corner when the trading deadline comes around. Unless it's the perfect oppurtunity...but it better be a given if that's the case.|`|9EpMhhtVaa	Great for Cleveland, I doubt NETS would give up Yi.      NJ gets 2 valuable expiring contracts which will allow them to flexability and the CAVS will get a solid 2 guard who will add much needed size to the back court as well as another offensive option in the post.  It would be a good trade for both teams slight edge for the CAVS because of Yi.|`|WLXFAeSnaa	I like it|`|NJtjJA8Baa	I'm sorry, but that is the most one-ended trade I have seen. Snow doesn't even play, and Wally is paid 12.9 million dollars too much (13m).

Talk about knowing your enemy. They know the strengths and weaknesses of alot of the Steeler players. Of course Tomlin knows this, but even so, it's making a Cardinal bet looking mighty good. Whisenhunt should be able to get in Roethlisberger's head to devise a scheme to minimize Hines Ward's impact (assuming he's able to play at 100%).    Consider this: Pittsburgh has played 2 of the top 7 passing teams this season in Indy and Houston and given up an average of over 20 points per game. Both were home games for Pittsburgh where their defense is off the charts, and more importantly, Arizona passes for close to 30 pts per game more than either. For these reasons, i'm leaning on the CARDs to pull it off.     The final comment: The "us against the world" mentality has been a lethal force during the last several weeks, so count that as an edge for the CARDs.|`|0Fi9EANKaa	any given Sunday|`|54587a005ce491d9b4862a09ef7af9acaa	of course they should show up. You can't trust the good ol' U.S. mail, to get the Lombardi trophy to You, in good condition.|`|CF16tWhWaa	you guys are soo stupid!  and for one of the guys above dat said "the cards almost lost to the cowboys" it actually turns out that the steelers wer closer to losing to the cowboys dan the cards wer!!! IDIOT!!!!! every game the steelers lost was becouse the opposing team spreaded out the steelers defence! the steelers D doesnt function good like that becouse they dont even rush more than seven players to begin with!!!!!!! their not known for blitzing alot of players! they jus happend to blitz great defensive play makers! but all warner has to do is spread out the pittsburgh defence! and as for larry fitzgerald.............. will anybody stop him! ofcourse not! the only way to stop him is to prevent kurt from getting him the ball! and for u steeler fans, dnt bvllshit me! u cannot stop fitzgerald! not one corner bck has has done a good job of shuuting him down! he will elevate and beat anyone to the ball! OH, and i 4got to mention! almost everygame the cards played, was won in a impressive fashion!

WgTKHqlnaa	No, I don't think it would be awesome. I'm Canadian but beyond the Flames, I don't cheer for other Canadian teams over American teams. In fact, I dislike most of the other Canadian teams. For example I hate Vancouver and Edmonton because of division rivalry and as for Toronto, well, they're Toronto...enough said about that. I don't like Dany Heatley as I think he's one of the biggest embarrassments to the game and the country so I hate Ottawa. I don't mind Montreal. So in the finals if it was an American team vs a Canadian team (other than Calgary or Montreal), chances are, I'm cheering for the US team.|`|AA10895316	And which underachieving team will do that?|`|qdg8G12Iaa	As an Flames fan who is an American i agree.canada = hockey.I live in the northeast and hockey still isnt a big deal up here.When  used to go to Montreal i was amazed how hockey crazy it is.Hopefully the Flames will go to the finals and i will be able to go!|`|3b1f171c73bb2e24acbb7271e47a68faaa	Too bad they cant beat the Bruins this year!!!!|`|X1yZOMYHaa	I don't think it's happening this year. The only hope that exists is Calgary, and I don't see them getting through the west. Montreal won't reach the finals, and even if they did they wouldn't beat San Jose or Detroit or whoever. Calgary is the best chance because if they did somehow get through the west they'd have a good chance against whoever wins the east.

75ZMWlnnaa	federer will definitely have to change up his game plan against rafa who i must say has improved steadily on HC, he is playing very well this AO, he is stepping inside the baseline when he is playing, and attacking rather than purely defending which is what he was doing the last 2 years.    i think federer needs to get to the net as often as he can, he needs to keep the points short.    if fed gets drawn into long baseline exchanges with rafa, then i think 9 times out of 10, rafa will win them (if fed has not figured this out yet after FO and wimbledon last year, then he is just dumb).    also, when fed makes a net approach towards rafa, go right down the middle, so rafa does not have an angle to pass him up at net with. i think if u slice it right at rafas backhand, he can not react that quick and then fed has a nice easy volley to put away.    also, the serve will be key, his serve got him out of so much trouble in wimbledon 07 final. fed has not been serving that great, but lets hope he has a good serving night if he gets to the final.    roger should practice with a lefty before the final, and get the lefty to keep serving slice serves to his backhand (rafa will be doing that constantly...since it has worked very well in the past against fed).    to be honest, i think if rafa and fed verse each other in the final, i think it is safe to say that it will be very dependent on which federer shows up.    if the federer who played against berdych shows up, i think rafa will win in 4 sets.    but...if the "ruthless" federer who played against del potro shows up, i think it will roger to win in 4 sets.    *** i am really hoping it will be a rafa vs roger final on sunday ***|`|Rz3N2Nlnaa	6 Hail Marys and rip into him.|`|MAAxboH7aa	HE'LL LET RAFA WIN|`|xezI4AlNaa	Roger must learn how to use his left hand to beat Rafa.|`|YJM6Ouujaa	i think federer will try to win|`|iHqwbqgJaa	He needs to score more sets than his opponent.

1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	"Job" is an insider term, short for "doing the job".  Meaning I'll be "doing the job" of getting pinned and making you look great doing so, so that the fans see that you are a capable and credible wrestler for beating me.  Done right, we both look great.  I "did the job" for you tonight, the next time we face you might be instructed to "job" to me, to keep our rivalry from being one-sided, and to keep the fans interested and coming back for more.<br>  <br>  "Lose" is just that; everybody's definition of not winning.<br>  <br>  Some pro wrestlers are "jobbers", and there are two different types of jobbers.  One is an exceptional wrestler who can carry anybody to a good match, but either hasn't gotten over with the fans or is an older wrestler in the role of helping to build the next generation of stars.  His expertise and talents are called upon to bring out the best in his opponent, to showcase his strengths and to minimize his weaknesses, to show the fans that the "new guy" is indeed worthy of a push.<br>  <br>  The other type of jobber is one who has little talent and hasn't gotten over with the fans.  His job is just to be a "tackle dummy" for the big-name to get some exposure, generally in a short squash match, designed to make the big-name look nearly unbeatable.<br>  <br>  There IS another type of "jobber", but it's generally a temporary role for a big-name (or up-and-comer) who has gotten into trouble with management and his punishment is a losing streak.<br>  <br>  "Job" is an insider term that's become popular among fans; it makes us sound "smarter" and more "in the know" using insider terms, and implies we know the whole thing is a work.  "Lose" is a kayfabe term implying that we're just being fans, and don't care to put on our "we know it's fake" hats because we ARE fans talking to other fans; we're all "in" on it and we don't need to prove that to each other.<br>  <br>  WQ:  The best I've seen were done by Chris Benoit.  Dynamite Kid a close second.|`|H3nbC71eaa	Like Dragon said, a job is losing. Regardless of whether it was a squash or a good match, the wrestler is a face or heel, losing is doing the job.<br>  <br>  Jobbing constantly and never winning the match is a wrestler who's a jobber.<br>  <br>  <br>  WQ: IMO Dynamite Kid's snap-suplex was the best.|`|a3z7ZjVtaa	Awesome question, I've been wonderin' the same thing.<br>  Job- Someone who loses in every match, a jobber does this to make the wrestler look good. ex.)

And, I guess it is the spirit of football, the season never ends and people are anxious to get started for the next season.    It's like making a Christmas list.|`|cd51ab07fbecfef33f286305112484c4aa	It's fun to try to guess where players will fall and who your team might get. Also, for the NFL it is big business.|`|1gPJO37qaa	Because they want to, what are you going to do about it... waste of a question on your part|`|u7GBP579aa	its fun, gives fans somthing to do during the offseason|`|J3kfQtViaa	b/c a couple of days after the superbowl thats all therse gonna be to argue about here.|`|201gZ8w0aa	because some fans want to know who there team may draft it keeps people interested
wQUkZm2Oaa	Just a quick note on the first bit: If Roma win by 1 goal to nil(ie the same scoreline as the 1st leg which was 1-0 to the home team) against Arsenal then the match will go to extra time(30 mins) and penalties if no other goals are scored in those 30 minutes. However if the game in Rome is won by Roma by 1 goal with Arsenal also scoring(ie 2-1, 3-2, 4-3, 5-4 etc) then Arsenal would go through on the away goals ruling.<br>  <br>  Bayern can, as you said, field a reserve team as the likelihood of Sporting winning 5-0(to tie it) does not look good. However 6-1 to Sporting would be sufficient as they would have tied on aggregate but will have scored one more away goal than Bayern.<br>  <br>  If Real win 1-0 at Anfield then the game goes to extra time and again if no other goals are scored the game goes to penos. Otherwise if RM win 2-1, 3-2, 4-3 etc then these would be sufficient scorelines to put them through as they would have scored more away goals than Liverpool's 1 away goal in the game earlier.<br>  <br>  Juve need to win 1-0 to take the game to extra time, or win the game by 2 clear goals to win the tie overall. If Chelsea lose by one goal in any other scenario other than a 1-0 to Juve then Chelsea will go through. If Chelsea lose 1-0 then the game goes to extra time.<br>  <br>  If United win on the night at Old Trafford they go through. If there is a score draw(ie 1-1, 2-2, 3-3) then Inter will go through as they will have scored the away goal(s). If the game ends 0-0 again, then there will be extra-time and penalties(if there is no other goals in extra time)<br>  <br>  The Atletico-Porto game was 2-2 in the first leg in Madrid therefore Porto have 2 crucial away goals. If the return leg ends 0-0 then Porto will go through as they scored away goals in the first leg draw. If Porto win on the night they will go through and the same goes for Atleti if they win on the night. If the game ends 1-1 then Porto will go through since they scored 2 away goals in the 1st leg and that therefore trumps Atleti's 1 goal in the 2nd leg. If the game is 2-2 -> extra time + penos(if needed). If the game ends 3-3, 4-4, 5-5 etc then Atleti would go through as they would have trumped Porto's 2 away goals in the 1st leg.<br>  <br>  If the game ends 0-0, Barca go through because of their away goal. If it is 1-1 -> extra time + penos(if needed). If 2-2, 3-3, 4-4 etc then Lyon go through since they will have scored more away goals to Barca's 1 away goal in the 1st leg. If either team manage to win the game on the night then they will go through since the first leg was a tie.<br>  <br>  Villareal were the home team so they must do exactly what Lyon must do since both they and Lyon are the away teams in the 2nd legs of their respected ties.<br>  <br>  Also the away goal rule carries through into extra time if the match goes that far, eg if Roma beat Arsenal 1-0 in Rome then the game will go to extra time. Then 30 minutes will be played(15 minutes a half) where if Arsenal score an away goal in the extra time then Roma would have to score another 2 goals to progress.|`|d9fqzUGSaa	for example, juventus hs to score twice the goal chelsea scored and not allow chelsea to score, for every goal chelsea score the more juventus has to add. for example juventus has to win by 2 0r 3 goals to win. get it|`|eec685f8de34940a4e941788661cddb1aa	I was born with two legs.

Pittsburgh wins 55-19, but subs in the backups once up 48-10 at the end of the third.|`|0Fi9EANKaa	I think it will be a closer game than expected. thats an unreal prediction.

kQSSz2X2aa	What is a "sniper bullet"? If you are outside there isn't anything you can do to change the humidity.|`|YrxLbfiIaa	HI.... Instead of trying to impress you with my wisdom - just look at these articles -- Your answer is there.....|`|km9cQNAXaa	Jason is right in that as humidity rises the bullet drop will be less, however the difference is very small and for all practical purposes it can be ignored.<br>  <br>  The difference is less than half an inch at 500 yards with a .308 which is probably the most common military sniper round.<br>  <br>  Ian M|`|biPiIIeMaa	Jason is correct about the density of air, etc. I've personally tested and tried this over the years with a number of rifles from M16s to .30cal and .50 BMG sniper rifles, and it doesn't have as much of an effect on the direction as it does the arch of the bullet- direction (right or left) is more affected by the wind direction and speed. Of course, a larger bullet travels slower but is less affected by wind.|`|92jr44kFaa	Against common belief, Higher humidity means the air is LESS dense than drier air.  This means that, at higher humidity, the bullet drops less.  As a rule of thumb, a 20% change in humidity will move your point of impact about 1 MOA.

cd51ab07fbecfef33f286305112484c4aa	You got me on that one too. In the Philly game Eli seemed zoned in on trying to throw to Boss and Smith. Not sure what the deal is with getting rid of Toomer. Hope he comes back I am not sure Mannigham is going to be ready and I know Moss isn't.|`|0Fi9EANKaa	he's getting up there. that being said though, I think they should have given Amani Toomer more of a shot at being a  1 receiver after Buress had his incident. the guy has a lot of mileage on his truck.|`|gvMr9lMbaa	He is going to be 35 next September,Plaxico is done so they need a  1 WR.Armani is solid but he's old and it was obvious once Plaxico was out the Giants don't have a big threat at wide-out.
1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	Jeff Garcia<br>  <br>  Warrick Dunn<br>  <br>  Joey Galloway <br>  <br>  Derrick Brooks<br>  <br>  and Half of Glazer's Staff through this Hard Economy.|`|XLXncQu9aa	I think the releases were both good and bad.  They were good for obvious reasons.  Letting go the players that took up a lot of cap space frees you up to sign players in the free agency and for the draft.  So obviously the moves were money related.  However, I believe the Bucs have stepped back as an organization.  Letting go of that many players at once was a hard decision but you have to look it and ask the question, "will the team be better or worse off without these key players?"  Warrick Dunn even though he is entering the later years of his career is still a capable back, and they could have used him.  I think releasing him was not the best because they need to produce their running game that has struggled down the years.  Secondly, releasing Ike Hilliard and Joey Galloway may hurt them offensively.  The Bucs never had good receivers and even though Galloway is aging, he still had big play capabilities.  I think their offense will be sub average with these latest releases.  The Bucs did it for money, but they will suffer if they don't fill the offensive and defensive voids.|`|1n5E6ensaa	Overall, I like the moves, especially on offense. It will hurt them next season, but all of them are older players and there is no way that they win the Super Bowl with those weapons on the roster next year. Hilliard always seemed surprisingly productive, but possesion receivers are pretty easy to replace(IMO). Galloway was a good weapon in his prime but didn't play much last year and probably isn't that important w/ A Bryant there. Dunn is one they might have kept, but w/ Cadillac and Earnest they should be fine. <br>  Defensively, they should have kept brooks... but they're moving away from the cover 2 and wanted more size at LB.|`|MbcvI1A9aa	the face of the bucs are gone. when i think of the bucs best players not many names come to mind. no jeff garcia, derrick brooks, warrick dunn, cato june, or joey galloway. <br>  <br>  next years prediction for the bucs<br>  6-10|`|nlKg1g4Jaa	nothing.

However the WWW is next to impossible to ride fast comfortably down non-groomed terrain, so if someone steals it you can probably catch them sliding down the hill trying to make it to the park.|`|LIKkt8djaa	People will steal any decent to good setup bro. If you're really worried about it get a lock for your board, or usually mountains have a board check in.. usually costs money but sometimes it's free.<br>  <br>  Or if you know people that work at the mountain leave your board by them.|`|jTaW3goeaa	People will steal anything if you leave it out in a bad place long enough.  I buy a locker every year at the mountain so I can keep my stuff locked up safely.  I never leave anything out because its so expensive to replace.  If you're a regular rider at one mountain, look into purchasing a season locker so you have a safe place to keep all your stuff in, A its a safe alternative to leaving stuff outside unattended if you have to go inside for whatever reason and B, its easier than lugging all your stuff to the mountain every time you go

Yr0mHSF3aa	Not really, it kinda like wearing shoes that are just a size too big. You'll learn how to kick the ball in a way to compensate for the extra space in the shoe. Since its just one size bigger, I can't see it being a problem. You might just feel like a clown you know? Oh and if you use your toes a lot (which you probably shouldn't lol) then you might have a tiny problem because your toes don't acutally reach the end of the shoe. Good luck.|`|S0VK07o3aa	Most probably not. I know a lot of players (including myself) who buy their football boots up to a size bigger, and then put another 1 or 2 paris of socks underneath. This will cushion the foot more when making those hard/powerfull shots and will also make the boots more comfortable. I personally find that it improves my touch and feel of the ball.<br>  Also a couple of my friends currently have Puma's and they are notorious for being a bit tight fighting, so you may not even need to put on an extra pair of socks to fill that space. However I would strongly recommend that you do not play with the boots if you find that they are WAY to big because you can actually damage your feet when playing. This can range from injuries such as blisters to even fractured toes from miskicking the ball when your feet are moving around to much in your boots.
UvFMp6oOaa	well, depending on how old you are like 14 or older or something, if you want to do gymnastics for competition I would say stick with Soccer. If you start gymnastics now then you will be with a lot of little kids if you want to do a club team but, if you want to just do gymnastics for fun go for it! You could just go and do a tumbling class to be able to back handsprings and tucks but it will probably take a while, and keep in mind if you do it for club you have to do all the events like vault beam bars and floor.<br>  <br>  <br>  I would say go to your local gym and see if you can just jump in a class for a day and see if you like it and then if you do try gymnastics, you can always go back to soccer if it doesn't work out and when You are trying gymnastics you wont really be getting out of shape for soccer because gymnastics has a lot of conditioning.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps you! :)|`|TrIPTjYZaa	me too!<br>  im good at soccer but i also wanna try gymnastics.<br>  but i would suggest to stick to soccer first and if you get tired of it you can switch to gymnastics.<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  try a new thing, try gymnastics and if you dont like it, go back to soccer.<br>  <br>  good luck deciding :)|`|vrgsenkNaa	i would say to try gymnastics and see if you like it. in the meantime, keep up your soccer skills at home so if you don't like gymnastics, you can still do soccer

py0DpCh4aa	I think it comes down to 2 issues:  Can Pittsburgh control the Warner - fitzgerald offense?  And can the Cardinals Defense hold the Steelers offense?    I think the Cardinals defense will win or loose this one for them..|`|YCwmCDkUaa	*copy & paste*    Steelers by 10...    31-21...|`|23c29ffe0b37caf3f16d0ec3d3b9c0ddaa	cardinals 24  steelers 20|`|gN3P3zszaa	I think this one is going to come down to the Arizona blocking/Pittsburgh pass rush. With good blocking Warner is a phenomenal quarterback but when he gets rushed he gets pretty horrible. If the Cardinals can keep the Steelers out of their backfield it will allow Warner to become a real threat in the passing game, and that could really open up their running game. In truth, I agree that Pittsburgh should definitely win this one, but if Arizona can protect their quarterback they can prove to be quite competitive.|`|Wi5E9C2Eaa	Steelers must win.

However, be aware he could be on his best behavior when the cameras are rolling. When I used to attend wrestling events back in the 90's I never saw a wrestler sign autographs. When Chyna (Joanie Laurer) was signing autographs for her autobiography If They only Knew at various bookstores the rules were restrictive about autographs: 1. only one picture taken; 2. only one autograph and 3. Chyna will only sign the book not any collectible or picture a fan brings from their house.

This caused Michaels to suffer a concussion and back spasms (kayfabe). Michaels then entered a feud with Randy Orton when Orton claimed that he could beat Michaels. Michaels then faced off against Randy Orton at Judgment Day 2007. The week before the match on RAW, Michaels was attacked by Orton after his match with Edge and was attacked during Judgment Day backstage by Orton, which contributed to his injury from The Great Khali. At Judgment Day, Orton defeated Michaels when he collapsed during the match (kayfabe). Michaels was then taken out of the arena on a stretcher and was joined by his wife in the ring.

0186b813ce100b9c77b6fc50ff7a276aaa	it depends...how often do you skate?have you been to any skateparks?are you comitted to skating?|`|4940e80bc9dc7c02af4ee0f3ffb61d31aa	well many things can affect how you skate. if you dont have good balance then your most likely goin to fall. another thing is commiting. if you dont try to land a trick you wont land it. you have to commit and want it. you also got to have balls, not litteraly because i kno a few girls who skate, but the balls to try stuff. go ollie a gap or something. also if your over weight dont worry about it. my best friend is a lil chunky but he can skate really good. unless your like a behemoth then um good luck next time? but yea just try some stuff. you wont get anywhere if you dont try.|`|80fcd0b9c7e75290e8a3cf9c5cce212faa	Fear. It is the fear that stops you. You must go for it. Show no fear.|`|AA12064568	The guys who are really good at anything are the ones doing it all the time, not twice a week.  And they don't bust their *** doing it, it is play for them.  I'm sure if you didn't try so hard and just did it more often, or all the time, you'd like it alot more and skate more.  You should live and breath and think skating.    The one thing that is critical to skating is eyesight.  Make sure you can see properly, because you need to know where everything is, and where you are to it, precisely.  This cannot be stressed enough.  Get your eyes checked and wear some good glasses, goggles, or whatever you need.    Another thing is balance.  Make sure your nose and ears are not stuffy, or you can just about forget doing anything fancy.  Your balance will be off if there is any congestion, and sometimes this stuffiness will even affect your eyesight.    One more thing is you need to wear all the propper gear so that you can hang loose without any worry of injury or getting hung up on anything.  Otherwise you are going to be tight.  If anything isn't quite right, you'll be limited in what you can do and that will affect everything else.    Lastly, you should make sure your equipment is not only the best you can get, but is also the right stuff for what you are doing, and the right size for you.    You didn't say what kind of skating, but the above applies to anything.  For instance if you skateboard, the board can be many different types, shapes, and sizes.  Then there are all types of grip tape, shoes, pads, trucks, wheels, bearings, hardware, and skidplates etc.  And for inline or ice skates, there's everything to consider there as well.  Don't leave anything out.
AA11614736	A better question is "who will be the HOLDER and kicker of the future for the Cowboys?"    Bet it WON'T be Romo no mo!|`|e51d513ea5bf8209f78025130c42d6a8aa	What Cowboys fan would not want ROMO?    Romo is a future star.  He had several good games.  Did he make mistakes?  Did he have "off" games?  Of course he did, for all practical purposes he is a rookie.  A rookie brought the Cowboys to the Wild Card round.      If this is because of the mistake that cost the game, then you need to remember he is a better QB then he is a holder.     Romo will improve.  Next  year he won't make as many young guy mistakes.  I think we will grow into a very talented QB.    All this coming from someone who doesn't really care of the Cowboys.|`|5439591ed90eaa1deb53c28c565f9d3caa	Romo of course. Good quaterback.|`|7497f7be7e0fda7dd55a633c697f0d23aa	Brady Quinn or JaMarcus Russell they will trade T.O. and Romo to Detroit for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd round picks, quit dealing with TO, not deal with Tony "Lucy" Romo (get it... ever watch Peanuts lol) give the Lions another talented, mouthy, loser receiver to make up for cutting Charles Rogers last year, and throw in Romo to make it passable and they probably get Russell, and a talented RB and OL to boot|`|1303b5dd4ca633e7664ee837f0fd6ad8aa	I'm thinking Tony Romo.

Romo is Parcells QB, as long as Parcells is there, Romo will be the QB    Parcells does things his way thats how hes always been, thats how he will always be    Not to mention Romo proved this year he deserves another chance next year, he showed alot of talent, and to me at least proves he deserves a chance to go into the season being the starter getting all the snaps in training camp etc.    Just to prove im not biased, Im a huge redskins fan, so there ya go, I have every reason in the world to hate him, but I think hes great|`|17326a885cf7c679e40fc472ab795f66aa	Romo no doubt.

rl7LytnYaa	Drop J. Hamilton, Sammy Sosa and jonathan broxton and pick up Shane victorino (great for steals), Brett Myers (temporary closer until Gordon is healthy but eventually will be a starter again within a couple of months.  He has 200k ability.) and Oliver Perez (he is starting to look like the stud he was a couple of years ago).  I would trade Penny since he is a second half dud and package him with Phillips and make a run at BJ Upton for 2nd or Penny and another player and upgrade at second with BJ Upton or Utley  or at third with Ryan Zimmerman.  Even better, trade to get a closer!!   By making this 2 for 1 trade, thne you pick up Markakis|`|0b4597e5a91b96e257462065d6ff2df5aa	add henry owens.|`|9svou8znaa	For SURE pick up Markakis. Drop Sosa for him. Move Kent to 2B right now, then when he goes cold, put Figgins in for him.|`|D8byavg6aa	I'd bench Lowell and start Figgins, platoon Sosa & Hamilton. Try trading for a better reliever than Dempster, Soria and Bronxton. Starting pitching may fix itself in regards to Lincecum and Hernandez. Its early May, give it till June before making drastic changes.|`|d8168mmzaa	I would drop Broxton and pick up Brett Myers since he is closing now for Philly and could get you some saves. I think Markakis has more upside that Sosa or Hamilton for this year.

jSkHquK5aa	YES of course.|`|IWM1khX7aa	Duh!  How come a billion people around the world kick a ball around every day?<br>  <br>  It's more than a sport than basketball or any other team sport.  It is the most challenging since you use your feet instead of your hands.  You need more stamina, more speed, more skill, and more coordination than basketball.  A lot of people (especially my fellow Americans) say soccer doesn't require a lot of strength.  They just don't see that you have to take a lot of kicks to the body and have a powerful shot.  A lot of people die in soccer becasue it's so hard.  Also, my fellow Americans don't like it because they can't use their hands and say it's not a sport.  Since the hands are one of the most useful part of your body, it's a challenge to not use them.<br>  <br>  In basketball, all you have to do is be tall.  Seriously.  Look at Shaq.  He couldn't play soccer.  Maybe Cristiano Ronaldo or Ronaldinho could play as point guard.  Kobe Bryant even likes soccer, and he admires how tough the sport is.|`|c1Ob2S9raa	um yeah its the same as ur NBA but with ur feet....and you have bigger goals...i would say that soccer is becoming the second highest played/talked about sport in america-->after football of course.<br>  <br>  = D|`|9Heqyw2gaa	Yah!

On the other hand basket-ball players are AMAZING! like its incredible the things they can do  blowing out a cupcake before dunking?  Superman dunk with superman suit? its really AMAZING.. but soccer is more teamwork as basket-ball requires more individual skill..   Teamplay goes to soccer as OMG  HOW DID HE DO THAT goes to basketball|`|e9cqlNB4aa	Basketball is basically luck. You shoot the ball and hope that it goes into the rim. Soccer takes real skill and lots of practice to be good at.
jSkHquK5aa	The Laws of the Game are the rules governing a game of association football. They are written and maintained by the International Football Association Board (IFAB).<br>  <br>  Law 1: The Field of Play<br>  Law 2: The Ball<br>  Law 3: The Number of Players<br>  Law 4: The Players' Equipment<br>  Law 5: The Referee<br>  Law 6: The Assistant Referees<br>  Law 7: The Duration of the Match<br>  Law 8: The Start and Restart of Play<br>  Law 9: The Ball In and Out of Play<br>  Law 10: The Method of Scoring<br>  Law 11: Offside<br>  Law 12: Fouls and Misconduct<br>  Law 13: Free Kicks<br>  Law 14: The Penalty Kick<br>  Law 15: The Throw-In<br>  Law 16: The Goal Kick<br>  Law 17: Corner kick<br>  <br>  Some refer to an unwritten Law 18: "Common Sense"<br>  <br>  Even today, the above 17 laws are less than 50 pages of a 5.5" by 8.5" pamphlet. This compared to other professional sports where the rule books number into the hundreds and thousands of pages. In 1997, a major revision dropped whole paragraphs and clarified many sections to simplify and strengthen the principles. These laws are written in English Common Law style and are meant to be guidelines and goals of principle that are then clarified through practice, tradition, and enforcement by the referees.<br>  <br>  The actual law book has long contained 50 pages more of material, organized in numerous sections, that contain many diagrams but just did not seem to fit with the main 17 laws. In 2007, many of these additional sections along with much of the material from the FIFA Questions and Answers (Q&A), were restructured and put into a new Additional Instructions and Guidelines for the Referee section. This section is organized under the same 17 law points, consists of concise paragraphs and phrases like the laws themselves, and adds much clarifying material that previously was only available from National organizations and word of mouth among referees.|`|BMConIedaa	Google "soccer rules"<br>  <br>  You'll find dozens of sites that will explain the rules.<br>  <br>  The one you might have the most problems with is the Offside rule.  Most similar rules in other sports can be summed up in a statement.  In Soccer, that statement is "the goalie must always have help."  If you have the ball, you cannot pass the ball to a teammate who is closer to the opposing goalie than the last defender.  This is probably the hardest rule for non-Soccer players to understand.  It is to prevent a team from leaving a player hanging around the goalie box waiting for a long pass.  It rewards strong team-based tactics.<br>  <br>  And plan your projects better.  Waiting until the last minute WILL NOT HELP you as your school projects get harder as you get older.
JXJQTgULaa	Poms is a type of athletic dance. Pom squads showcase precise and tight arm motions as well as technical dance skills (such as jumps, turns, and leaps), and various other types of dance including hip hop, jazz, and kick lines. Teams are judged on a number of criteria including form, team unison, showmanship, precision of motions, jumps, leaps, turns, choreography, enthusiasm, with an emphasis on the visual use of the poms. You should definitely work on your motions and make sure that you are staying flexible for your jumps. You should do some ab work outs. They are really helpful when doing "Toe touches" (I forgot how to say toe touch in "dance" language. Its called like a Russian Jump or something ).<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck =D

Il ne connait rien au rugby et il na jamais vu un ballon que du haut des tribunes. Cest vrai que pour colporter les potins de vestiaires il na pas son pareil .Vous saurez tout sur lage du capitaine,  quel age celui-ci a   eu sa premire dent ou le nombre de maillots qu il a us durant sa carrire , mais sur le jeu , explications ou analises, rien, un cadrage dbordement ,il ne sait pas ce que cest. Pourquoi telle ou telle tactique ? Il est encore aux abonns absents. Et avec ?a ,il se permettait de critiquer la composition de lquipe ou  de donner son opinion sur la forme de jeu  pratiquer.  Il aura quand mme laiss une expression imprissable dans le vocabulaire du rugby :  LA PASSE AU PIED . Avant sa "trouvaille du siecle", ?a sappelait tout simplement   coup de pied  suivre .  Aucuns regrets de son dpart , le rugby se porte trs bien sans lui .|`|bcd0e9f9716642867598cbd23c497755aa	Qd il est pas dans le ma?s, il est dans la cabane avec le chien (meme si la cabane est tombe sur le chien)

It might not match with your clothes, but once you use them, you'll be glad you got them.|`|UmYa3pwTaa	i always wanted to buy the predator, so go for it, just remember one rule the shoe don't make the player,  ( i just created that )     good luck dude, soccer rules !!!!  hopefully you'll go to see Beckan play when he comes to the U.S|`|20h99fg3aa	I'd personally say neither of them. Your choice though. I'd go for the nike mercurial talarias - either yellow and green, or silver and red. predators are still lush though.
