20090305084107AARJDy6	Family & Relationships;Friends	What Should I Say To My Friend.?	My mate started dating this guy a few days before Valentines day. He is rather rich whereas she isn't as rich. I asked her what she was getting him for Valentines day and she said she isn't sure but she is going to spend alot on him as he said he has spent loads on her & that he has bought her 5 presents. She bought him 3 Xbox games, A gold chain, Aftershave & a DVD boxset. She obviously spent quite abit on him. He bought her a fake rose, a box of cheap chocolates, a top from Primark (cheap shop) a tiny Me2You teddy & a keyring. She was really upset because she spent alot of him and he didn't spend much on her. I felt sorry for her and I said well you no not to spend that much on him again but she keeps spending money on him then she comes to me moaning that he doesn't spend money on her. What should I say to her? I keep saying don't keep spending money on him but she won't listen to me!

20090305084926AAzdmFg	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why is it that more people...?	I asked 2 questions in Marriage and Divorce, 3 minutes apart from one another.      The first was "If you could change anything about your spouse, what would it be?"      The second was "What is your favorite quality that your spouse has, that you would NEVER change, and why?"      I got 28 answers for the change-my-spouse question, and only 8 for the favorite-about-my-spouse question.      Is it just me, or does it seem people prefer to focus on the negative? :)
20090305084928AA0qVeQ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I need a nice way to explain to my why I need the lights off when we make love?	He's put on a few pounds over the last couple of years, and I understand this, it happens as we get older.  But after I come home from an evening at my boyfriend's house (who is 23), I just can't really work myself up to be with my husband.       I love him, and he's a kind person, but I'm not really attracted to his body. I mean, his face is fine, but when I see him naked, I just can't bring myself to do it. If I turn the lights off, I can usually think about something else and get it done.       Should I make it seem like a game or something?  I'm not sure what to tell him the next time he wants some action on the couch while he's watching the Outdoor Life channel. I mean, I'll still be able to see him with the TV on and all.  Thoughts on any creative ways to get around it?

He lives about 45 minuts away, and had to come to the next town over from me to get something. I suggested that he come over after he was done, instead of going back home and then driving all the way back here. I had asked him to help fix my door, which he said he would. So, he comes over, fixes the door and a few other things. He watched the last of the football game and then said he was going home!!! What the??? He said he didn't realize I wanted to go out (duh- it's Saturday night!) and he was tired and not dressed to go anywhere. I suggested that we just get a pizza and hang out, then. He said he wanted to go home and said he was tired again. He wants to get together tomorrow night and told me not to be angry. Of course I am! Do I call him and see if he is home? If so, what do I say? (We have been together forever- but it's been complecated). Thanks for the help

20070722205829AAHhm81	Family & Relationships;Friends	Who to choose?	So I have basically two groups of friends. GROUP A consists of friends that I have known for a long time. They are fun and do random things that make me laugh. My problem is that they have been acting weird. They all worship this one girl (I'll call her Christine) and whatever here opinion is, theirs is. So, things have been said about me, and well, you get the picture.       GROUP B (new since last school year) are fun just to talk and hang out around. They are more of the "party type" (I don't really like to party a lot) but have never turned their backs on me. The only thing is, I am not as close and I am thinking that it could eventually end up badly.       I love both groups dearly but there are problems with both, but I couldn't bear to lose either one. I am panicking and crying about who to even sit at lunch with on the first day of school. Please help. It would mean a lot to me.

20081003041354AAh8mUN	Family & Relationships;Family	Should I have been invited to dinner with my fiances relatives?	I have been in a relationship with my fiance for 9 years and engaged for three or four. I have been very supportive of him through his illness and other issues. This evening he is out at a hotel having a meal with his parents, sister and his uncles family who are over from interstate, yet myself and my children were not even invited. In my family and my friends families, partners and their children are always welcome, and wouldnt you think that after 9 years it might be about time that his uncles family and I met? Yet no one even asked... so I am wondering, do you think this is right?
20090304220752AAYUQbG	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do I deal with this situation?	My husband and I already have two little boys and a few months ago I expressed my desire to have another baby. We decided to try to have another and start trying but then later I decided that maybe I needed to think about it more. I came back three months later and hubby said he has changed his mind and that he doesn't want another baby!. I am hurt and kind of depressed about this....How do I deal?

20090305011730AAH13Fv	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My Who-be-husband Deceive My And My Family?	Please I need good advise from Yahoo! Answers.      I met my boyfriend in my granny's house on Dec. 25th 2006 and since then we are great lovers. He didn't told me that he had a wife earlier and a son which I later learned from his kid sister in 2007; I confronted him and he told me that he forget to tell me because they are not together again. He told me that he is working on divorce with her and immediately he divorce her, he will marry me. Last year June, he proposed to me to marry him but I told him that he had to divorce his first wife and he will also marry me legally which he agreed. I believe him because his ex-wife is not living with him but his son is staying with her and I have the key to his house that I went there whenever I feel and I never met his wife there. I had knew almost all his family, he also knew mine and he went home to my village to do new year with me and my people and we did a little family introduction there. It was after this that I learn from an outsider that another woman is having his baby girl which I asked him and he said that was when he was still at teenage years.      Yesterday I was coming back home from my office when I saw his junior brother and he told me that he want to go and meet my boyfriend, I said I also want to see him and we should both go together. We met my boyfriend on the road and he told me that I should go home that he is coming to meet me home now that they want to have a meeting with his mother. I agreed and left and told him not to keep me waiting long for him. As I was going home, I met his senior sister coming out from an hospital which is nearby my house with a new baby at her back, I greeted her and ask that where does she see baby (since she is not pregnant) she laugh and make to go but then turn back and she asked me that didn't my boyfriend told me that his wife just delivery a baby girl this afternoon (the girl he told me he was divorcing). I was shocked and short of word. I told her no and left.      This guy has not only hurt my and my emotion but my entire family also. I have not see him since then and he didn't also call me. Please I need advice, what should I do?
20090304222305AAnYhpK	Family & Relationships;Friends	Am I insecure for...?	Am I insecure for yelling at my supposed friend because he has dirt on my social archenemy but doesn't want to share it?      In obvious terms, people would call him my "bitchh," but I think what makes our relationship different is that I actually have respect for him.      So anyway, the story goes:   I have this guy, he's K for now, whom I hate with every cell in my body, and he doesn't really know it. I don't think so at least. I'll be sarcastic only to make it seem like we're "tight," you know. He's just... too complicating for me to describe his personality/ annoying-factor. I want to "socially (and possibly mentally, but I know this will take longer and weeks of plotting) murder" him.   He's the type of guy that won't let anything burst his little bubble of obliviousness and optimism. I want to crush it!      My "bitchh," (lets call him B for now - which is such a coincidence because that's what I really call him anyway), is withholding, according to him, INTENSE, very useful-for-me information. I don't want to *break* him, but I want him to spill on whatever piece of information he has on K. This piece of supposedly valuable information isn't what I'm going to use to get back at him, but it definitely will play a part in my scheme.      Btw... how do I hurt an already conceited, narcissistic 14 year-old's ego? I want to get this K good!      I know it sounds like I'm just another bitter 15 year-old trying to find something to grumble about in life, but I'm not. Honestly.         B && ME -- Tenth graders.   K -- Filthy, dirty ninth grader.            **part 2**   Well this was really my question, but the other problem just popped up.      Am I insecure for, when I get the chance, hurting everyone in as much ways as possible when given the opportunity to do so?   Even with friends -- close, close friends -- I'll turn on them just to make myself feel better. And no, I don't think I'm an ugly (both physically and personality-wide) person; it's just that the things I'm good at aren't really helpful towards other people.   I'll manipulate people into doing things the way I want things done. When I'm feeling pushed aside or unacknowledged, I'll go instigate some sort of easy-fix problem with two people just to keep myself busy.
20090304221231AAhdIUT	Family & Relationships;Family	Family Issues trying to convince dad and more?	How can I convince my dad to give me text?   I tried to ask him nicely and here were my reasons   he told me I dont get out much and hang out like "normal kids" but then he doesnt want me to have text. It's like he wants me to be social but doesn't want me to have text?   My reasons for text were:   Helps get to know people better relationships with friends   Is an important tool in a relationship with a girl   It's the only way to talk to anyone because no one actually calls anymore   It's only ten bucks a month more and he's a doctor he should be able to afford it   People told me I need to get texting badly    I want to have fun I don't want to miss out anymore compared to my friends   I been home for the past 10 years and not really got to hang out with anyone sleep overs, go to the mall etc.   I've never been to a summer camp cause he said it was a waste of money   Another reason i didn't mention to him though was that he sends his mom 3 grand everyother month just so she can buy "vitamins" alcohol.    I just feel like I've missed out on too much during the "fun days" of my life and I just want to have a little fun during my High School years.   I've always had straight A's in Honors classes   I never ask for anything and everything I own I get from my mom who has to work and deal with a lot more stress than him. She buys me and my siblings our clothes, tuition for school and our piano lessons. Because my dad says all that is a waste of money.    All my dad does is ***** and complain about money when i saw in his excel spreadsheet of finances he was loaded well in my eyes with about 50 grand when me and bros and my mom are the ones doing all the chores around the house and he says i dont do anything at all to even deserve a phone.   sorry that i just went off ranting a little bit      His reasons   Waste of money because you dont make money texting   Waste of time   "If they were really your friends they would be your friend even if you don't have texting" but they are my friends they always invite me to their house but my dad doesnt let me go do anything with them   "That's alot of money" i say in my head your a doctor its only 120 a year   "You have to work for it" i say in my head I already get excellent grades and do chores around the house      I just finally for once in my life just want to have fun and feel like a "normal" kid Me and my brothers and my mom feel like he gives all of his attention to his mom   We don't even feel like we really are his family some days.   He doesnt know squat about us personally   because of him im kinda skrewd up in the head   because of him my mom is emotionally disturbed   because of him my brothers dont respect him   because of his mom he is like that cheap, selfish, and not a real father figure.   what the saddest part is that I look up to my friends dads they have actually thought me more about life than him   Their the guys who played catch with me at the park while he was on the phone making long distance calls to his mom   I just for once want something   I know that Jesus loves me but I just feel like this is too much   I'm really sorry but I really need some guidance please

The society now has over half the marriage end up divorced and that means more than 50% of the kids live with step parents. Are you a step mom or dad? Can you really treat step kid(s) as if your own?

The reason that I am asking these questions is that I am a single mom at the dating scene. I want to set the right expectation to the potential partner. Thank you.

I'm planning my sister's and we've had quite a cake problem. We can either order on the island and bring it on the ship or order on the ship. However the ship (Holland Eurodam) has no way to see pictures of cakes and they are so slow with email, not knowledgeable on phone calls.      Have you gotten a cake on a cruise ship? How did you go about it? Did you just take a picture and consult with someone the first day? Did you contact the ship bakery a week or so early?      I'd hate to agree to do it this way and then find out they can only make heart cakes with writing on it that says Wedding Cake.  If you've ever bought a wedding cake, please answer.  The cruise is April 18.      Any help would be great. Thanks.

He said he's never felt this way about anyone or anything and wants to spend the rest of his life with me :)       http://s227.photobucket.com/albums/dd229...   Isnt he soo cute/!!   I'm SOO HAPPY!  I'm so in love :)  I can't wait to marry him :)      How did your partner propose?

Please answer for both.      Would you stick by / defend:   -Your spouse/child if they committed a robbery?      -Your spouse/child if they began using drugs?      -Your spouse/child if they committed a rape?      -Your spouse/child if they committed a murder?  What if the murder was to avenge you, because that person had raped or tried to murder you?      -Your spouse/child if they hit or otherwise abused you?      -Your spouse if they cheated on you?         Thanks! :)
20090305053518AAdVmfv	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is it considered cheating on my husband if I sleep with his boyfriend too?	We've been in a big argument about this. Okay, so he has a boyfriend. Big deal. He still pays the bills, so I don't mind if he gets a little action on the side. However, I've become really close to "John" because of all the time he spends at the house.  Well, one thing led to another and me and John hooked up a few times.  I didn't really have a problem with it.  But apparently, my husband found out and now he is mad at ME.  I don't feel like he should be getting mad at me, when John is the one who was double-dipping. I really feel like John was in the wrong for cheating on my husband with me, not the other way around. What am I supposed to do here? I'm really at a loss.

20090305055752AAZDyL8	Family & Relationships;Family	Do they care less about me?	Hi everyone,(i apologize it is a bit long)   i'm the youngest member of my family.the very best thing about my personality is my sense of responsibility.but,many ppl hav misused my kind-hearted & responsible nature.i dnt care if any person outside my family misuses it,but it really hurts when my family does.i hav a best friend wid whom i share my every problem.but she has no tym 4 me so i came up here to share my sadness.   my mom is most of the tym caring 4 my bro(plz dnt call me sick, i've been realizing this since i was 2 or 3).whenever i'm upset or tired and i need just a little hug to revive there is no one.i've to take a really important examination of my life over vich my entire career depends but she never cares about it.on the other hand is my dad who has all considerations towards my two sisters.he never forgets wot they ask him to do and always forgets wotever favor i ask.i'm a very young lady and i dont want to live in depression,so i try to live cheerfully in all trying circumstances.but,sometyms it hurts so much tht i cry(as i am, right now).   i want to add the most important factor that, wht i hav been doing 4 all these years for my family.i hav been spending nights and days to assist my father in his job work since i was 12.i care 4 my mother so much that i left my plans to study in order to work and give her a wonderful lyf.my siblings leave each and every assignment of theirs for me to do and i do them.the time tht ppl call "spare" or "leisure" or "for relaxation" is something i rarely find.my best friend for whom i do whateva i can in order to release her from trouble, now she has no tym for me.what hav i done? i had the ability to do my work wid all responsibility but today i'm misused as a "SERVANT"...don't i hav a lyf  as well? don't i want to live happily and carefree lyk these ppl? I cannot protest, because if i do so they all call me "MAD, PSYCHO & SICK".why God has given me this type of lyf? i want to be "happy" thts all. i really refrain from thinking abt these troubles in my lyf but sumtyms it crosses the limits...   just tell me ppl...do u think my parents care for me the way they care for others?

20090305054314AAAkDxa	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Friend in an abusive situation, unsure of what to do?	I'm hoping someone on here knows California laws...       I just found this whole thing out about a week ago and I can't just sit by and do nothing.       A very close friend of mine has been married for about 4 years. For the first 2 years everything was okay, or at least that's what she told me.       After those first two years her husband started pushing her around (not actually hitting her but pushing), the thing was that she was pregnant with her daughter at the time. Her daughter is fine.       She found out around the same time as he started pushing/shoving her that he was on meth, of course he didn't tell her she just caught him at some point and that's when the hitting started.      He's not hit their daughter but the violence is escalating for her (my friend) and she feels like she can't leave him because if she calls the police he will kill her...      I've found someone who can take her in (I wish I could, but it's too far away to afford a plane ticket), in another state but she can't do it and take her daughter with her (or at least that's how she feels).       Is there any way she can take her daughter with her without filing a police report for the abuse? Would it legally be kidnapping? I hope someone can help.

20090305052207AA95Onx	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	If you ever had a LOVE ADDICTION.. PLS Help me! im dying?	I have a love addiction. Growing up i had lack of nurturing and attention and i was abandoned. I learned how to care of myself and not depend on others.    Then this guy came alongg.. when i was 18 and he stole my heart, we have been in love (crazy in love) ever since.(Im 22 now)    In the beginning of our relationship i was still independent till he kept saying that i should depend on him, and that he would be my everything. And i made the mistake to believe in that.      Last night he told me that he was done with me, and i begged him (how low am i?) saying pls dont go there, and i kept asking him over and over if he's sure. And he answered loud and clear :  ''Yes im sure''       And now im completely lost, i feel sick restless and nervous going through things an addict would go through if you would take his (drug etc.) away. I have no friends left, no social life cause everything was about him.All i could think of during day was when i was going to be with him again. And he made me feel i could go on another day.      I dont know who i am anymore, if you have any advice or any websites that gives you steps to recover please tell me. I cant live like this any longer then i already have.      I appreciate you answer. Thank you billion times.

My father hated my grandmother (his own mother). I grew up hearing stories of bitterness, anxiety, pressure and resentment that made me inexplicably and horribly tense around my own family. My father remarried and now he's a much more stable man than he ever was! I'm glad for him, but I'm still bitter at his having broken up my family and in the process not having shown any love, respect or compassion for my mom. He also - of course - could not see the bitterness swell up inside me over this. Have you ever had someone recognize the bitterness in you and ever help you through it? A friend, a family member?

20090305053435AAdYU7J	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Now or after 6 months for the divorce?	As you can see I have been delaying the declaration of my intention to divorce to my wife and family cos this constant fear is telling me to postpone it for some new fear like- after she gets a new job,after i get more financially stable,after her brother gets a better job ,after my sis gets married and so on.While the matter of fact is I dont want to live with her even a single day more if I had none of the fears and societal pressures.I am about to leave on a long tour of duty abroad away from home for next 6 months in 10days.I deeply feel that I should apply for divorce and then leave cos this time by the time I am back I will be 37 yrs old and donno when I will get remarried after that.So is it right to divorce now or come back and do it.Its scary anytime I do it.Just that right now my wife is going thro a tuff time with a job loss and financial trouble in her family.However I intend to transfer the appt we live in on her name when we divorce.We have also decidd for a mutual divorce.   Is it right now or after 6 months to go for it??
20090305053441AA1T7nm	Family & Relationships;Family	My mother is severly emotionally abusive. . . is it wrong to try to get me and my siblings out?	I am already 18, and god knows I could and want very much to run. So far away that thoughts of my mother can't even reach me. But I have a younger sister (16) who is literally my world. I would rather die then leave her behind. And an even younger brother (12), luckily, since he's a boy, he's spared most of our mothers acid word.       Ever since I was about 10, which is when our parents got divorced and our father shoved out of our lives, our mother has blamed us for everything. She tells us that we do nothing but make her life miserable, that we destroy everying, that we wont be happy until she's in the hospital. And even the small things - if she loses something, it's cause we've misplaced it, or if she knocks something out of the fridge and it breaks or spills, it's cause we put it in wrong. Even if it's something of hers that we don't even touch. She is a very aggressively angry, hostile woman, and blames us for every single negative mood or emotion she has.      Tells us things like "you must like it when I'm pissed off cause you don't stop till I'm yelling". She's yells and screams, cusses and calls us names for things (nothing at all, or accidents) so excessivley (spelling. sorry) that you could almost laugh. To her, if you have an opinion or a thought, or a belief that she doesn't like, or is opposite of her own then it's wrong. Or talking back or disrespecful towards her. She only respects or wants to hear our opinions when they compliment her own. We aren't allowed to ask questions because she says she doesn't have to answer to us. So we've learned to keep our thouughts, beliefs, etc. to ourselves because they're not important. She cares not about our feelings or emotions, she simply cares about us not showing them, around her, because then we're "showing our ***", "trying to start something", "pouting/mopeing", "being disrespectful" towards her, or "being a child". If we're sad or depressed, instead of asking us what's wrong or if we're okay, she'll say something along the lines of; "you better wipe that look off your face" or "if your gonna pout, go somewhere else", or "your not gonna ruin my whole night".

20090305053534AAlGAqM	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	If you are into porn- can you help me understand my boyfriend?	have just stumbled upon the fact that my boyfriend has a long term porn addiction. From what I found, I know it is something that has been going on for many years and that he knows it is an addiction. I really need honest opinions from genuine porn addicts themselves.       -He says he has a low sex drive, but he watches porn every chance he gets for hours.  Does he know that he is depriving us of intimacy  and doing real harm to a good relationship?   -Is there anything I can do to make him want  to participate in sex and not be solo/voyeur?   - Why does he collect and download pictures instead of just looking and moving on?   - Is it possible at all for me to help him curb this so he becomes a moderate user and uses it as a stimulant for short periods (like a toy, magazine etc) or is there nothing I can do.

It sucks cos she told me she still loves me, and im still in love with her. She told me to just forget abotu her and move on, but most of the time we are so happy together, and when i love somone i find it hard to let them go. I tried to text her a few times but she ignores me and i feel like she has just let everythign we have ever done go to ****. Like she hates me now and finds it easy to forget about me. She also told me that shes thinking abotu stuff and to give her some space, but its so hard sitting here feeling helpless. I live in a really rural area so its hard to keep busy. Guessing i just want to hear how people get over somone if you are both still in love, or any advice on how to deal with it or people who go tback together? Thanks

My divorce agreement says that I have to pay both child support "through the college years" as well as the cost of education and associated expenses for college.

20090305055740AAhqLEb	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Wife wants to separate, has cheated, hasn't left yet..help!?	My wife an I have been married 8 years with a 21 month old daughter. We are both attractive people and she took a regional manager job 10 months ago that brought her in contact with a variety of new people from a 200 mile radius. Problems slowly began escalating with us, with her becoming more nagging and cruel in arguments. We went on a cruise, had a difficult time getting along, and when we returned she said she wanted to move out. After a couple of weeks and a lot of discussions, she admitted that she was interested in a guy from work, and they had gotten together already, but no sex as yet. She said she did not want to cheat on me, so she would rather move out. We talked and decided to give it 30 days to invest ourselves 100% to see if it could work. I made one poor decision of not spending enough time with her and she gave up...said she didn't know if she now wanted to invest herself 100%. Part of my problem was the lack of sex and she said she although she finds me very sexy, she is not desirous of having sex with me.       The other night I again questioned why she seemed not to be giving 100% of herself during this short time, and she was non committal. I asked if she had still been talking to this guy on the phone and she said no and promised, but my suspicions were not allieved. She said she had still been thinking of him quite a bit.      It seemed to me then that there was more than the "interest" she had mentioned before. I told her if she was not committed to giving me 100% of her self for a measly 30 days than unfortunately I guess she has to move out. She asked if there was anyway we could do a "trial" separation, but achnowledged that she would be seeing this other guy during the trial. I dissagreed, and said that is not fair, and if you leave it would be a divorce. She asked me for 2-3 days to think on it..it is day 2 now...anyone have suggestions for how I handle this. I do not desire for my family to break up, but this is killing me slowly...thanks!

I know life takes you were you dont expect but when I got married I had realistic expectations like having a baby by now. Turns out my hubby hasnt worked in 2 years, no plans for a baby, he is mean to me. My friends and family all want me to leave but i feel guilty because his brother commited suicide last year and he isnt over it yet. I am not inlove anymore but I feel if I leave he wont be able to handle life anymore. I also feel like I have been living in hell everyday and its my turn to be happy and stop pretending. Gosh I feel so selfish..he has already tried all depression meds and has a therapist..nothing works depression runs deep in his family. Do i stick it out or is it my time to go? When I say he is mean he just is very controlling and he hasnt left the house in about 2 weeks, his family is worthless.
20090227055727AAEPMlE	Family & Relationships;Friends	Me & My Stupid Big Mouth!!?	I had an argument a while back with one of my close friends Kelly. We stopped talking altogether but she kept saying things about me to my other friends which annoyed me so i responded. In the end enough was enough and we sorted our differences out. I've recently become aware that my friends hadn't told me everything Kelly had been saying about me and she said some really horrible things about me plus my family which really annoyed me. She said all this to one of my mates Sarah so I hit back and told Sarah everything Kelly had said about her. Now Sarah refuses to talk to her all because I opened my mouth. I was so angry though and wasn't thinking at the time. I no I am a total ***** for doing that because what Kelly said was all in the past. Plus I'm not angel as I've said things about Sarah too. What should I do about this?
20090305072629AAFQ34R	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Would this be a petty thing to  do?	I found a picture online of my soon to be abusive ex-husband online posing with a gun. It's a bee-bee gun that looks like a hand pistol, I've seen it in the house before and always thought it was odd. Now I'm making the correlation between his violence and that fake pistol.         I have a restraining order on him now for trying to force himself on me Saturday night. He didn't hit, but has in the past. I'm uncertain if when I go to court for my permanent restraining order if that complaint will be enough to keep him away from me and my kids.       Would it be a petty thing to bring the pictures to court with me?
20090227050432AAgstZm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Just how patient are you when it comes down to being in a relationship?	It all depends with me, is she worth the hassle? I just can't tolerate immaturity.  If it's a disagreement that we have, I just want to feel as if were both putting forth that effort to makes things work, instead of it being one sided. If she's cheating on me, I'm done.  Things can become real stressful, that's why I say sometimes, being relationshipships can be bad for your health. So just how much can you endure before you had enough? and what are somethings you just refuse to put up with?

20090305074647AAr0RP2	Family & Relationships;Friends	Tell me what you think I should do about this...honest answers please?	I met a really nice guy through one of my family members about four years back. We hit it off instantly, talking on the phone several times a day and meeting up about 3-4 days a week after work just to hang out together. It's like we became best friends sharing with each other life stories and a close bond. We have never been intimate except for sharing a few thrilling kisses over the course of your friendship. My feelings grew for him but I still didn't go there (sexually) with him as I did not want that to complicate the foundation of what we built in our friendship.    He needed help and I was there for him, just as a friend should be and how I would expect him to help me had I ever needed the help. I told him one day how I felt about him (b/c I could no longer hide my feelings for him) and he shared with me his interest in me but still, we didn't allow ourselves to make a boy/girlfriend relationship from what we had. We drifted apart after the fact of me lending him some money (which he never paid back). Anyway, I am at the point (which I always have been) that I treasure my friendship with him over the money, the friendship meant so much to me. When I see him (which is very rare) I get those butterflies in my stomach and nervousness comes over me. I miss him a lot.    What should I do if anything at all?      Thank you,

20090305070508AACL1UO	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	At my wits end in dealing with this divorcing couple's drama?!?	I own a business -- a day care -- which I operate from my home.      One of the children I care for is a 2 year old girl.  Her parents have separated and are going through a divorce.  I seem to contintually get put into the middle of their financial situation, and it's really starting to get to me!      For example, I give them a discounted rate of $135 per week because they supply their child's food.  They decided that they would split that in half, and they would each give me $67.50 per week.        I do work frequent overtime for them.  Actually, because of them, I am working 7am-7pm Monday-Friday, and 1-2 Saturdays a month 8am-4pm.      The overtime was also assumed that it get split 50/50.  However, the father made a BIG stink and yelled at me for talking to his ex wife about it (when really, it's her business, she pays half.)  The mother has been NOTHING but nice to me, and in fact ALWAYS puts extra money in my check to show me she appreciates all I do.  The father gives me grief every time he has to hand me a check, and he nickels and dimes like crazy -- he won't even round to the nearest dollar!  My last check from him was $389.94.  LOL.        Anyway, the Dad is constantly making ME figure out the math and stuff because he doesn't want to be responsible for certain days, etc.  So instead of splitting it 50/50, they did it this way:      Mom is responsible for full payment Mon and Tues, and 1/2 Payment Weds, Thurs & Fri.      Dad is responsible for 1/2 payment Thurs& Fri only.      Since I had given them a flat weekly overtime rate, it was a BIG mess to divide it up hourly.  The Dad is ALWAYS putting me in the middle and it's very frustrating.        Would it be wrong me to e-mail them if ANY more incidents occur and ask them to please have just 1 of them pay me out right, and the other parent can pay the difference to the 1st parent?        I'd feel bad because it probably causes more drama to them, however, I also feel like this is NOT my business and I am sick of getting caught in the middle!  So, should I tell them that, or just continue to deal with this?      Thanks!
20090227061007AAys4xe	Family & Relationships;Friends	Does My Crush Secretly Like Me Back?	I’ve known this guy for a long time, like maybe since the beginning of the school year and he’s a very nice person. He knows I like him, but he says he just wants to be friends. I really like him and feel there is no one at school that is better than him. I’m not sure if he really just wants to be friends, because sometimes I feel like he flirts with me. He usually hugs me every time it’s time to leave school and when he hugs me, he always picks me up, lifting me up into the air, making me wrap my legs around him. And then when I get upset, he always makes me laugh and one time even tickled my face. A couple of days ago, when I was complaining to him about this guy I didn’t like, he tucked my hair behind my ear and ran his fingers through my scalp and touched my face. He does that often, but he does the hair thing to most of his female friends, too. Does this mean he likes me or is he just being nice.

We've been married 11 years on Saturday but in the two years my hubby has really slacked off in cooking and I am at the breaking point of exploding.  He is off during the week but I can't remember when HE cooked....wait, It was four weeks ago.  On the days I work, I come home and cook.  On the weekends when I am off, I cook.  On the days that I work and HE is off....I cook!  I''m DONE!  When he cooked four weeks ago he complained the entire time that I wasn't helping him and it was too hard.  He grilled hotdogs, opend canned chili and cut some fruit.  Not only did I not help him with his 'gourmet' meal, but he had to clean it up himself (oh the horror).  I know he works long hours, but when he's at work I'm not sitting at home giving the kids McDonalds or microwave meals and he should know that as he's off during school days with them too.  If I say something I'll explode and he's over defensive because he's 'working' but with a school charity he can call his own hours at.  GRRRRRRRRR!

And that's all we have ever been . Good friends . But recently this year he started to like me as more then a friend . I wasn't sure about my feelings for him, and I was also in a four month relationship at the time. So now about 3 months later I have feelings for my friend. (I'm single now) But I don't know how he feels about me. I used to see him three times a day now his schedule got changed and I only see him sometimes in study hall. I think he might still like me but I can't be sure. I've tried giving hints because I don't want to tell him straight out, if he doesn't feel the same we won't be friends again because it was akward enough the first time. Is there any way to tell how he feels? He is single also .

20090227040519AAVPIzg	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Wondering the love of the husband for his wife?	i felt lately that my husband love for me is now being overshadowed by his love over his children. Most of the time his mind is somewhere else. and everytime he had a conversation with his kids, you could tell that he is really overjoyed.       I support my husband 100% when it comes to his kid and do not question anything that he would like to do when it comes to children.--if that makes him happy.       My concern is, i'm feeling left out as a wife. His mind is always preoccupied for his kids. He do shares some conversation he had with his kids but i could tell very little just enough to say that he is sharing something. Lately he is becoming cold towards me and there are some nights that he would tell me that he is tired.  I don't know what's my role anymore.  I just hope that he notices how the situation breaks my heart.      A little advice will surely help. thank you
20090227060905AAazvv3	Family & Relationships;Friends	Broken friendship, any chance to revive?	Not long ago due to various gossip and people whispering in my ear i accused my best friend and partner of sleeping together. My partner has cheated on me before and my best friend has been known to sleep with taken men. It all happend when we had a bit to much to drink...she now isn't talking to me.

20090305061638AAi5lDt	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	WE'VE ONLY MET ONCE, HAD SEX ON THE FIRST DAY WE MET, AND TODAY HE ASKED ME TO COOK HIM DINNER???  WHATS UP?	I met this guy on Tuesday, prior to that we had been emailing and talking on the phone for the last month.  I slept with him the night I met him, which I thought would have ruined the chances of him wanting to see me again, obviously not!  He called and texted yesterday.  Anyways after sex he said he was going to come see me on Thursday and he said he wanted me to cook him dinner...I'm originally from Costa Rica, and he has been to my country like 3 times, and he likes the food from there a lot (he said he wanted me to cook a traditional dish from CR).        MY QUESTION IS...DOES THIS MEAN HE'S USING ME, OR WANTS SOMETHING SERIOUS?? IS THIS A GOOD SIGN?  ANY HELP IS EXTREMELY APPRECIATED....THANKS!

20090305073800AACw5Xx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is the week before a date supposed to be h-e-double hockey sticks?	I'm going on my 1st date ever this Monday (I'm 16, he's 17). I'm nervous and scared. We are really really great friends. He knows everything about me and had actually asked me out six months ago. I had said yes, but I was in a musical at the time and we had a pretty big fight. Well, I asked him out early this week, and he agreed (not before embarrassing me and making me say how I felt about him). We have not talked on the phone since then (we were on the hours for 4 hours late Monday night). We texted a little, but he seemed distant and really short with me. I'm scared to call.       Now, I'm second guessing what I did. He is older than me and has experience. He also knows I know nothing when it comes to dating.       I don't know what to do :(      Thank you.
20090227035250AAfu3kB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is he doing this to me? I don't get it!?	There's this friend I have and last night he text-ed his whole cellphone contact list about his problems with his girlfriend. I was getting sort of angry because the only time he would talk to me was if things got shaky. So I told him to stop text messaging me about things I didn't know the answer to. Let's call this friend Bill.   So I have another friend. Let's call this friend Gary. I am absolutely in love with Gary. He's been my best friend for about two years. We both like each other but we're too scared to take a risk on each other and put our close friendship in jeopardy.    Well Bill got really upset at me, and kept text messaging me saying how much he loved me and that he wanted to be with me. I kept trying to explain how we both have someone important to us in our lives, and it's better to stay this way. He keeps trying to call and he is in way too deep. My question is, how do I get him to let go? I'll do almost anything.   And my second question is how do I get Gary to see that if we don't take a risk, we won't know what could have been?
20090305071614AABtpHV	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Please settle this arguement for me?	My husband thinks appearence doesn't matter.. ever. He's going to the bank to ask for a loan so we can buy some land, and he put on a camo cap. I asked him to please wear something nice and fix his hair instead of covering it with a cap, and he said it doesn't matter what he looks like. I disagree.. I told him that a person who walks in looking nice will be more likely to get the loan than a person that walks in filthy with holes in their clothes and he just said I'm stupid and that I know nothing about it.      What do you think?

20090305074354AAdpW9b	Family & Relationships;Friends	Would you write this letter?	SO last night I had a very detailed dream about a good friend from grammer school. We were very close, and played sports together at the local recreation park. In 7th grade, I left public school to go to a private all girl catholic school for 8th grade.  and she went on to the local public school, and we really just lost touch. Ive heard stories about her, now she has a baby. and Her parents are separated. blahblahblah... but i want to contact her in some kind of way... and ive looked her up on facebook and myspace and on google.. and all i can get is her home address. Im contemplating writing her a letter, just saying I was thinking about you, and missed you. But dont know how to say it without coming off wierd. I think I am the only person in the world who would write someone a letter after like 7/8 years of not seeing or speaking to this person. What would you do? What would you say?
20090305061912AA1PfrZ	Family & Relationships;Family	Step Family Problems...Favoritism?	Okay I am a married woman with a 6 yr girl, a nine yr girl and a 11 yr boy from a previous relationship and my husband has a 7 yr boy and a 10 yr girl and a 12 yr old boy from a previous relationship. now my husband and I don't have money nor do my parents but his parents have money and so does his ex and her parents, so as you can see my step kids have a lot but my kids don't and thats wrong but not the main problem, the problem is that my husbands nephew (12 going on 13) is having a b day weekend this weekend for boys only but he only invited my oldest step son and his other cousins (and even some of my step sons cousin from his mother) but not my son, when I asked why he said it was because he doesn't like my son and that it was his party, so I told my husband and my husband said if he didn't invite my son that my step son couldn't go, so my husbands nephew said ok and just walked away, but I forgot that this weekend was not our weekend it is my step kids mother weekend, so the next thing I know my step son was packing his things to go Friday, I said where was he going? he said to Bryan's (that is my husbands nephews name) party, I asked how he said his mother said that when he goes home she'll take him to the party, I was so enraged my husband and I gave her a call she said that it was her son and that she could take him to any party she wanted and that her nephews were also invited and they were all going together, when my son found out he got so mad and said that step brother should not get to go if he couldn't, my oldest step son just looked at him and walked back up to the room to finish packing, I just wish my son didn't have to endure all of this but everyone hates him even my brother in law said that his son can invite and not invite who he wanted, and so now my son just hates that they are going to disneyland, the mall, and are going to race go karts and my son doesn't get to do it, how can I stop this?

20090305075028AAvnGxB	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Husband and myspace mobsters addiction or am I overreacting?	I am wondering id my husband is bored or just addicted to mobsters?  I was reading laurie B's(I think thats who it was) question and it struck me to ask....My husband is on the computer all of the time.....or he is out hunting (coon hunting)  When he is home all he does is play mobsters on myspace, I mean its like this  he gets home from work at 5:30 PM and first thing he does is goes straight to the computer logs onto myspace mobsters, here I am still dealing with our children all by myself like usual cooking dinner and dealing with their fights.  then dinner is done and I tell everyone to come to the table dinner is done....10-15 into dinner he finally decides to come to the table to eat and we are all done and leaving the table and he gets all pissy cause we didnt wait for him!!!  Well he was on the computer and I didn't think the children should have to wait.  then he runs right back to the computer after eating and then it can be 3-4 in the morning and he can still be playing!!  on his days off..well you can only imagine.....it is from the second he opens his eyes until he passes out at the computer like 12-18 hours later!!  and yes he sleeps at the computer.  Sorry so long but I just wanted to describe this...what should I do?  I have tried to talk to him and he tell me to shut-up and quit bitching at him, and I think he is denile...cause he proceeds to tell me he never uses the computer!!!!!!!  can u believe that..he's on it every day all day and night... what do i do?

20090305060304AA44hRo	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband doesn't even try to satisfy me, should I end it and move on?	I'm in my late 20s, and my husband is in his early 30s.  We've been married for a year, and dated for 1 year.  We have one child together (we got married a few months after our child was born).  My husband is a very good father, does very well with his career and salary (he makes enough for me to stay home with my daughter).       The problem- I have never had an "O" with my husband, and he doesn't seem to care.  When we do make love, he rolls over after 2-3 minutes of love making and falls asleep.      I'm considering "talking" to my ex boyfriend because I'm so frustrated.  Really, do men not care about pleasing women?  I clean, cook, take care of our child, and work out almost everyday.  I think I'm desirable to most men.

I need sexual strimulation that my wife doesnt want to do these days.   been like this for a few years and my body yearns for this attention.      am I wrong ?   dont really think wife would be so upset.   I feel great afterwards and my realtionship works out better with my wife when Im not begging for sex.      and It is wonderful to see a nice pair of new legs.

20090305063844AAd8YYS	Family & Relationships;Family	Can someone explain child support to me?	My boyfriend is just graduating college in May. He currently works full time and goes to school full time. He sees his (one year old) daughter 2 days a week. Him and the mother agreed to 200 a month in support because she lives with her family and they provide everything for their daughter. The mother also liked the amount of support because she doesn't want to give him their daughter over night yet. Plus we have no room in our apartment for a bed yet. So it basically works out for everyone in that regard. HOWEVER, in May we are getting a bigger apartment and will be going to the court for an every other weekend agreement. We assume the mother will not like this so she will probably take him in for full 17% PA child support. She has no job at all, never has had one and will probably want to live in her own apartment soon. I went on a few PA child support calculator sites and found out he will be paying her so much more money because she has no job. It's frustrating because her parents will continue to support her, while we bust our *** to make ends meet and she gets suport every which way and does not have to work. Is there anything we can do about this? Can we go for full custody of their daughter if she does not have a job and doesn't want to get one? She gets federal funding (medicaid, food stamps) and her parents make really good money (they live in an estate) It's frustrating. What do you think we can do about this? We are only in our young 20's and we want to have a family soon but I am afraid he will be sending this girl 17% plus extras and our children will not have enough plus our house and car payments. We're in for it. Please help.

20090305064911AAxIHCs	Family & Relationships;Friends	What can be done about my friend?	I have a friend who is absolutely terrible with girls. He can barely communicate with them and he does not make an effort with girls he fancies - even though he was offered by a girl he fancied to lose his virginity! He didn't take the oppurtunity because he wastes his time playing tricks on girls and pissing them off - he doesn't realise this won't help him. Because he is insecure and has low esteem he thinks he will never have intercourse. (In fact I know him well, and it looks like he never will). What do you think should be done to help him? He said himself that he doesn't want to be called virgin-boy for the rest of his life.

20090305071345AAQ1jQt	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	9 mo Pregnant & Husband left?	I am just about 9 months pregnant.  With the way the economy is and being pregnant my marriage is going through hardship. My husband and I have fought more in the last 2 months than ever before. The fights that we have mostly are meaningless but turn into verbal assult on one another. He has now moved out and I believe is going to file for seperation/divorce. I love this man dearly and my belief in marriage is that is it forever and that you should work through the good times and the bad times. He has left once before and we were able to work through it then. I am not sure if we can work this this time or if I should even try to work through this time since he has done this before. As of this moment I want him to be here for the rest of this pregnancy and be there when the baby is born and have our family, but the other side of me thinks that if he can just run away from our problems right at the end of the pregnancy (the time that I need him more than ever before) how will he ever be supportive later in life when I need him by my side now. I am scared, confused and devestated... any thoughts?? Anyone gone through this before??
20090305071456AAISyYZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Please Help!! I Dont Know What To Do?	I am 18 and like this girl, I want to ask her out but need to be sure she likes me first because I cant handle rejection. We speak for hours every day and see each other a few times a week, when we are together we get on so well I feel I could spend all my time with her and never get bored. My friends always say things to make things uncomfortable between us so I think she knows I like her. Im not sure where to go from here. I want to tell her I like her in a way that wont ruin what we have if she doesnt like me back. Does it sound like she likes me? She always makes more of an effort with me than anyone else, pays me lotas of complements and makes me feel like she likes me? I just need to know what to do, this has gone on for too long and I am going crazy.      PLEASE HELP

I thought that was so weird cuz i like to sleep with someone in one bed while i have a chance...What did he mean exactly? Am i too needy or is he just weird.. and yeah we slept on different beds :S so stupid since we already had s*x.

I don't have a problem with it, I'm just wondering what the reason could be to just come over one night and stay for a week. And no, she wasn't willing to talk, so just asking is not getting anywhere.      Any ideas or insight would be greatly appreciated.

20090305084521AA8LEh9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I overreacting or is she crazy?	My fiance met a girl in a bar while he was out of town for the summer for work (we were not dating at the time). They had a little fling which I'm assuming more than he's led on, but it's in the past and we weren't even together. Anyway, once he got back home we got back together and recently got engaged (this was 6 months ago).       This girl texts and calls him constantly. She stopped for a couple months, then recently started up again full force. He ignores all of her calls and texts. She checks his facebook multiple times a day and asks him about comments I leave. She also texts and leaves voicemails begging him to call her. He's been ignoring her, but the other night he got so sick of it he deleted her from facebook, called her and told her to stop calling, he's engaged, and she is being inappropriate. She started berating me (I have never even met this girl), and after all this, she is still texting and keeps trying to add him on facebook. I checked his phone (which was bad but I had to be sure) and all of her texts are "why won't you call me," "I don't understand why it's so hard to text back" etc and his call log shows he has never called her or text her back, so I know he's not leading her on.       She lives 1000 miles away. She will NOT go away even 6 months later. They only hung out for 6 wks and never dated...he even flew me out to visit him while he was out there, which she knew. So why am I so insecure about her? Should I just forget her? It bothers me she is going after another girl's fiance!
20090305082901AAta2T9	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Guys, would say this is an accurate statement?	My fiance has a number of exes and past flings he refers to as "crazy." One or two I can understand, but when they're all crazy, I have to question the vailidity of his statement.       I told him that when a man refers to his ex or a girl as crazy or a stalker, what he really means is "I screwed her over or hooked up with her and she thought it was more, so now she's mad."       Agree?
20090305085848AAYBs7S	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is this selfish of me?	I asked my fiancee to switch from first shift (6 a.m. til 2 p.m.) to second shift (2 p.m. til 10 p.m.) so I can spend more time with her?      Right now she gets home from work around 2:30 p.m. and I leave for work about 2:45 p.m. and by the time I get home, she's fast asleep.       I feel kind of bad asking her to do this because I know she loves first shift and it works out better for school too. A part of me feels like I'm being selfish but her and I seeing each other on saturday and sunday for a few hours only isn't good enough for me. She said she'll put in a transfer but I can tell she's not that happy. Should I just deal with the fact I'm not going to get to see her or be a little selfish and have her work another shift so we can see each other.         If I could, I would so switch hours at work, but that's not feasible.

20090305082120AA1ohAc	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Wedding party music questions?	yesterday I was going through my music, trying to pick out songs that didn't have to do with heart break or cheating (or strippers...oddly I have about 50 songs on my computer that mention strippers lol)      What kind of music are you playing?   Are you going for theme songs or just playing what you like?      I want to go for music I like, not for that cheesy stuff that eveyone always plays at their weddings (and for petes sake will people kill the Electric slide and Macarana already...it wasn't cool in the 90s its still not cool now!)   But I listen to stuff like, late 80s-early 90s rock  which is fine for love ballads but I also listen to a lot of rap and hip hop (my finace ONLY listens to rap and hip hop)   I am going to play that music at my wedding no matter what but im wondering if anyone thinks thats odd?   Have you ever been to a wedding that plays a lot of rap or hip hop?

If you see no reason to see to her intimate needs? What maybe cook more, clean the house more, spend more time with the kids that you somehow managed to help create? How about we just go on and do your honey do's since you can't find the time to do them because of watching four programs on TV at once? Younguns you go right on and tell me how committed you are in your five minute relationships to someone who has been married well over half her life and actually has the wisdom to know that it takes two to make a relationship work.

20090305083942AAMJzOO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Friendship over but want it back what do I do?	I met a really nice guy through one of my family members about four years back. We hit it off instantly, talking on the phone several times a day and meeting up about 3-4 days a week after work just to hang out together. It's like we became best friends sharing with each other life stories and a close bond.       We have never been intimate except for sharing a few thrilling kisses over the course of your friendship. My feelings grew for him but I still didn't go there (sexually) with him as I did not want that to complicate the foundation of what we built in our friendship.          He needed help and I was there for him, just as a friend should be and how I would expect him to help me had I ever needed the help. I told him one day how I felt about him (b/c I could no longer hide my feelings for him) and he shared with me his interest in me but still, we didn't allow ourselves to make a boy/girlfriend relationship from what we had.       We drifted apart after the fact of me lending him some money (which he never paid back). Anyway, I am at the point (which I always have been) that I treasure my friendship with him over the money, the friendship meant so much to me. When I see him (which is very rare) I get those butterflies in my stomach and nervousness comes over me. I miss him a lot.    What should I do if anything at all?      Thank you,

20090305084346AArXDjI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	If you tell someone you don't like something they bought you, should that person be angry?	My sister bought me a beautiful pendant for Christmas on an extremely thin chain, which was impossible to clasp (to get on and off).  It took me 30 minutes to put the chain on.  I was going to wear it to a job interview and wound up almost breaking it.  This was the same chain my sister had received from her husband for her anniversary, and she told me how frustrated and angry she got and she was cussing up a storm.  Anyway, I told her the pendant was beautiful, but I didn't like the chain because I couldn't get it on and off and how frustrating it was for me, but I got another chain for it.  I even brought out to her that she didn't like that chain either.  Now, she is mad at me because she said I wanted you to have something beautiful.  I told her the pendant was beautiful, but the chain wasn't, and told her I didn't want to hear anymore about it.  She is still mad at me.  Should I have said nothing? Actually, I wasn't mad at her about getting the chain, but just wanted her to know how frustrating the experience was of getting it off and on.  Any way to make this better? I have apologized, but I don't know what else to say.

Another I've known for 4 years.  They all "forgot."  My day came and passed.  Two of them I actually had to tell it was my bday coming up (one a few days before, the other the actual night before) when they asked what I was doing that weekend.  They were like, OH!  Well I'll give you a call, or OH YEAH, right!  Still, I never heard from them, no call, no email, no text, nothing.     I just don't know what to say or do about it.  They kinda dissed my last bday, too, and now this was a total diss.  Yet I'm always there for them, helping with bday parties, weddings, whatever.  Do I say something?  Should I just forget it?  Move on?  What would you do, how do you handle it when this happens?   And I know ppl get busy, I've been SUPER busy myself.  But it only takes a moment to call or write, it's not like I'm expecting a huge ordeal of effort.

20090305085523AAtDiIJ	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	A marriage/proposal conundrum?	I've been with a wonderful man for over 2 years, lived with him for 18 months.      He is considerate, loving, we share the housework and bills and argue infrequently. I want to be with him all my life and he has said so about me too.      But in the relationship, it is usually me that makes suggestions and he either agrees or disagrees. For example, I was the one who decided to get a pet, go on holiday, go out for meals or buy household appliances. Rarely does he take the initiative to decide to do something without me suggesting it first.      This works fine and we discuss things openly. We even decided we would like to try for a baby (he is very keen) after I tentatively asked him.      However, there is one thing I am old fashioned about and would never ask as I think it's the man's job - a proposal of marriage.      I really want to be married before having kids and have hinted as such subtly to him but he's not picking it up. It's not in his nature to be brave and forward enough to ask me outright, but now I think he'll never ask and it will be too late to have kids (we are in late 30s).      How do I discuss this with him without it looking like I'm forcing him to propose? I really want him to do it of his own accord but it's not in his nature.  I also want to try for a baby as soon as possible but feel wrong to do this unmarried.
20090305080523AALzfg4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys! Can't get it up twice with a condom? Is this common?	I am with this guy who has absolutely no problem getting it up. He can go for a really long time and its amazing. BUT the second time around, which was like an hr or 2 later he couldn't keep it up. He was hard for a little and it was good but then he got soft. He said that he can't go twice with a condom, it is too restricting the second time around and he can't stay hard. He claims he is fine to go for round 2 w/o a condom tho. I did not try this theory bc i do not have unprotected sex for a number of reasons. lol   Anyways is this a common thing for guys? I honestly have to say i do not mind it so much bc he is great the first time around and last long but i am curious.

Mostly my husband's friends but we got a save the date card about a year ago and I mention it to my husband who then tells me they sent out 500 save the date cards and realized they can only invite 200-300 people.  I was like WOW< how rude!  But my husband was like- Oh, well they just messed up.     This is the second time we have gotten a save the date card and then OPPS- can't invite you to the wedding!  Why even send them out then?        I didn't do save the dates for this vary reason because we didn't know how many people we could afford and I invited more people as other declined to try to invite the whole family.

20090305084524AAi9plU	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can I learn to be more patient with my husband?	A lot of times my husband just gets on my last nerve. I know I'm not exactly the most patient person in the world when it comes to relating to others but seriously, there are some things that he does that annoys the hell out of me.       Today, I asked him to run a simple errand for me. Now if it was me, I would have completed that task within ten minutes, fifteen minutes tops. I sent my husband out about a half hour ago and he still isn't back. Instead, he's found a way to incorporate other things to do along the way.       And before some of the kids on here try to say, "Oh, well maybe he's cheating!" He's not! He just takes his time in doing things and it drives me up a wall!      Please, can someone tell me how to be more patient with my husband?

20090305075425AAD9fE0	Family & Relationships;Friends	Just wondering if I'm over reacting?	My friend who hasn't been much of a friend lately has been bringing her husband lunch during the day which would be fine but then that strands my husband at work (he's been carpooling with her husband) and since I have a one year old, I can't always bring him lunch when he has a break. We haven't been driving this week because our car is totaled and we have a rental which I just now got a pass for so we can take it on post. She just now called me and told me that "there was a miscomminucation" and that when Brian has appointments or whatever, I'm going to have to figure out how to get him there because they're not going to drive him anymore. WTF. I haven't answered her calls for the last two days because I'm so fed up with her audacity. I mean, I thought that we were friends but we found out that when our car got totaled, they drove right by us, knew it was us and didn't even call to see if we were okay or if we needed to get our daughter home, since it was cold and raining and they live three houses down. I have taken her to the emergency room on a Friday and stayed there with her until 1 30 Am because her husband "was too tired". And now she's treating me like crap. I have done a lot for her and introduced her to a lot of people because her husband wasn't going to do it and now I'm ready to cut ties and just not talk to her ever again. Is that over reacting, though? I mean, I've tried talking to her over the past few weeks to try and figure out what's going on but she says nothing's wrong and that she's not acting weird. Is it just that I'm the first one to actually say we're not going to talk anymore? Or am I blowing this all out of proportion?
20090305085320AAtolBM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Crazyness going on around here!?!?!?!?	Long story short, I was supposed to go visit my ex this weekend coming up. I visited her Valentine weekend and we spent a night together drinking wine, making dinner, cutting up and talking basically all night long. We didn't sleep together. Then I week later she calls me and tells me she is not emotionally ready to spend an entire weekend with me. ok. cool, I can work passed this. So lately, we have been talking on the phone, bbming, flirting with one another here and there.      I guess through a mutual friend she found out I was going to go visit some friends in a nearby city and all of a sudden she is too. BTW she lives 6 hrs away now. When I found out I was like WTF! She has been asking me where I am going to be and what I will be doing for the weekend. I do love her still and do want to be with her, but was thrown back by this move of hers. What should I expect? Why would she do this on the same weekend I was supposed to go see her? Any insight would be appreciated!      No one saying she is your ex for a reason!
20090305085509AAIQMMR	Family & Relationships;Friends	What kind of prank is this?	Basically it feels like something sexual is happening when I fall asleep. I wake up with basically a sore penis and balls that feel a bit overswollen. Its a bunch of girls pranking me but they think I don't know yet. I still am not quite sure what they're doing but I know its bad.      What the hell kind of **** is this? Like are they raping me or something? What the hell?      They also used some sort of thing to make my cock/balls numb because I can feel it wearing off day after day but then my genitals get more sore.
20090305075651AA1vM3l	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it about the chase?	Is it really chasing the girl that you like? when you don't know if she is going to say yes or when you don't know if she is going to contact you? Seriously, I'd like to know because I gave my number to a guy 2 weeks ago and since then, he's playing little games with me (chating with me, then stoping, then come back...). And I am tired of that, so I might ask him directly "what the hell? Are you interested or not?". But if now you all tell me that it is about the chase then, I'll wait a bit longer.

20090305082914AACgGjU	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What do you think of this!!!?	So my wife finds out last night that I masturbate anywhere from 1-3 or 4 times a week.  We have sex only about once a week cuz she is always too tired or her favorite show is on.  She said that we would have sex more if I would initiate it earlier, like 8-9 pm vs 11-12 pm.  Usually her shows are on during this time.  She is now pissed and says that if I am so quick to masturbate that I would be quick to cheat.  I have no desire to sleep with other women.  What should I do about this?  what do you think?

Ever since I was about 13, I noticed that older guys started to hit on me. At the time I took it as a compliment because it made me feel like I was pretty, hot and well.. just wanted lol      but as i'm getting older i'm realizing that all they want and are thinking about is sex. haha      Why on earth would older men would think about that stuff about young teen girls?!      I have to admit, when guys that are like 20 hit on me I feel flattered because most  guys that age are EXTREMELY hot,   but still, wouldn't they be happier if they thought of girls who are more their age? More developed and experienced?      The day I turn 21 I would never even look at a 15 year old little boy, that's disgusting.

20090305090522AAN5Yww	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Could this be the big love?	So I've been dating this guy for about 4 months but we've only been officially together for 3 days. Even though through the past 4 months we've spent all our free time together and did everything that boyfriends and girlfriends do. I feel like I could really love him. Things with us are so good. We don't fight, if we have a problem, we just sit and talk about it and what needs to happen to fix it. Well we went through a rough spot right after Valentine's day because he said he didn't know what he wanted. So I went out of town for a few days and we texted each other. I told him we could either go on pretending like the other doesn't exist or we can give things  real shot, since we were never really together. After I got back we got together and talked. And he said he wanted to give things a real shot because both of us went into things thinking it wasn't going to work so neither of us were giving it 100% and it would have never worked like that. He also said that he thinks that things could really work if we both gave it our all and were completely open and honest with each other. So the ball was in my court at this point. And I was scared of getting hurt. Well, he asked me to go home with him this past Sunday to meet his family (this was still before I gave him an answer). And I did. His family was so nice and he said that they all really liked me. Now, meeting his family is something that I've wanted him to want for a while. I told him that we should do it, give this whole thing the shot it deserves the night that we were at his parents. Well I was talking to him last night and I asked him how many girls he's brought home since his ex-fiance (he was engaged about 4 years ago and walked in on her and his best friend doing the deed) but he said just me. And I know he's had like a couple of girlfriends since then and I asked him why he didn't take them home and he said because he didn't feel the  way about them that he does about me and that he hasn't felt so strongly about someone since his ex-fiance. We havent said "I love you" to each other yet, which is fine. But I every day that goes by, I become more and more sure that I do love him. Could he love me by the things that he's said, or is it too soon to tell? How long were you with your significant other before you told them you loved them?

Asking questions like was i happy with my boyfriend, is he treating me right and so on. I asked yes why. He admitted that he has been stalking me for 6 months. Following me in and out of work. He once followed me around shopping WITH my boyfriend to check if he was treating me right.   I walked off very shocked, and of course slightly scared. Problem is my boyfriend is protective over me, and is a copper. Do i tell him that an ex has been stalking me for 6 months? And what should i do about the ex?

Now...he wants me to go their to live with him, problem is I have an 8 year old son and my flat, if I go their to live I'd lose everything plus my family is here and I dont know anyone over there.   Friends and fam are saying he may come back once hes been there a few months (he's been here 7 years learning and working) so he may get bored and come back here after 2 months. Hes sent all of his stuff home and Im so upset I may never see him again. We dont have enough money to get married yet thats why we didnt do it that way.      Any suggestions or words of wisdom?
20090305084351AAgpaWB	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Do you think that an Indian born and raised (Hindi) man is more dominate over woman in general than a US Man?	If so... Is it because the difference in culture? I still see so called "modern" Indian men in their 30's have that tendency to be dominate over women today.  So what happens when a semi dominate Indian male has a relationship with a very independent modern woman from the US.  Will it work or does it only breed trouble?
20090305090607AA9NlWa	Family & Relationships;Friends	Super Long Question. Please answer. 10 BEST POINTS! Friendship is hard?	Thanks in advance, please read fully.   Friend problems.      Lexi:   My friend Lexi and I, have been super close from kindergarten. We've been through many things together, and that includes many fights. But this year we are in grade 9 and I don't know if our friendship will hold. From grade 7 and a bit of grade 6, she's been really close to my other friend Meghan. Lexi never really talks to me that much anymore, though we hang out with the same group of people. Lexi and Meghan leave during lunch and hang out with the popular people rather than us. I find that Lexi has changed drastically, and I don't mean in a good way.       Amber:   Me and Amber were super close in grade 7. We were inseperable. Although, she was really popular and I was average. She promised me that even though all her popular friends drank and got drunk, that she would never do that. We spent all our time together. She called me every five minutes, and I did the same. Now, she's been hanging out with Lexi and Meghan at lunch and she doesn't even talk to me anymore. We don't call each other. She says a whole bunch of crap behind my back.      **Story 1:   For Christmas, our school has a Christmas show. My idea was to do a dance on stage. Lexi and Amber agreed! We couldn't wait! Then I was sick for two days and when I came back, Meghan came over to me and said, I can't wait till we dance! I was kind of shocked that Lexi and amber hadn't told me that they invited Meghan into the dance, but I didn't mind. Then I found out that they had practices without telling me and they said that they didn't want me in the dance becuase I didn't know it. I also have irratible bowel syndrome and they never cared before. But just before the dance they said that they didn't want my stomach to hurt. I thought that this was BS becuase they never cared before. They apoligized and I forgave because I'm not a person to hold a grudge.      ** Story 2:   My new friend Kristen came to our school this year. Meghan and Lexi don't like her and we don't really know why. So me, Kristen, the twins, Chloe and Kate went to the mall without inviting Amber, Meghan or Lexi becuase they didn't like Kristen. They followed us to the mall and then came up to us and started spazzing at us and how they felt left out becuase we were always with Kristen. We came back with how they are always with Amber and never with us.       Kate:   Kate and I were close since grade 8 (last year). She's super smart and whenever I get a better mark than her she get's mad at me. I feel like she used me because last year, she didn't really have any friends and she was always with me. This year, people from her soccer team came to our school and it's like bye Sharon, I'm going to go hang out with them now. So I started to hang out with Kristen more and she got mad becuase she felt like I left her for Kristen.      Shannon:   Shannon has been my best friend since I was in grade 4. We were super close but then her parents seperated and she moved with her mom. We still keep in contact, in fact, we send letters to eachother all the time, even though she lives like 10 minutes away!   The problem with this, is that I miss her so much! I hate never seeing her becuase we are always busy!      So all in all,   Meghan, Amber and Lexi are causing big issues for us. We have no idea what to do. They hate us hanging out with Kristen, but they are never there during lunch. Oh! Also, whenever I'm sick I heard that Lexi always says, "Oh Sharon is sick again... What a surprise."   I find it funny how she cared before the dance when obvs. she didn't want me in it. She doesn't usually care. And she never calls me when ever I'm sick, but she gets mad when I don't call her.      I have NO IDEA what to do.   Please help, and thanks for reading all this!   Best answer to the answer which gives advice for all these problems! thanks!      PS: I can't get mad at Kate because everyone else loves her and right when I want to start crying she comes to me and acts like we're best friends again!      Thanks SOOOOO MUCH!      -Sharon <3

I lived with my gf since April of 2006 and we broke up December 31 2008 so January 1 2009 we were single. Now we did our taxes just this week and claimed common law together but we told them that we are seperated so now officically single in the governments eyes.       Now she is making threats of going after my stuff but I dont think she is entitled to it. Now the only things we bought together was a computer, monitor, and a tv. Now I bought alot of stuff that was for myself and she bought gifts for me and she said the gifts she bought me she is going to try and take back. I dont know if she can legally do that or get anything at this point?  Like can she actually go after my stuff if we are actually considered single now??

20090305082755AAoKzfc	Family & Relationships;Friends	I think im falling for my best friend.. am i a lesbien please help?!?	Please dont leave nasty answers because it isnt my fault i wouldnt feel this way if i could.   Im 14.   I have a VERY close best mate its not the usual going to town... she has told me everything. She has done bad stuff and i helped her through the lot and we have this thing where we will never fall out so we argue and slag each other off if we p!ss each other off and then laugh about it so we have a flexible good friendship. We also hug like every few minutes LOL its just something we do... habbit i suppose. We get called lesbiens at school all the time by any random person and we say we aint.       This is now the hard part... well i know for sure she isnt a lesbien because she fancies loads of famous guys and has been out with boys quite recently. She is also very boyish btw just thought you should know and we play fight like boys sometimes lol we arnt girlie girls and i think thats why people find us lesbieny.   But for me everytime i see her my world lights up and its the same when i get a text off her. After school when ive been with her all day i come home and sit on my bed like now and dont speak to anyone. If shes depressed so am i but when shes happy my problems go away and i am instantly happy. We only hang around with each other at school no one else. When i hug her or she hugs me i feel safe and feel really happy i cant really explain but yesterday it was after school and we was alone and she sat down and hugged me and i watched our shadow and she rubbed my back with her hands and in my head i said 'i love you' to see if it felt right and .. i think it did.      Im really confused :( Shes the best mate ever and i couldnt live without her but i always think weird things and imagine kissing her and if she gets a boyfriend or like the other day told me shed snogged someone i started to cry because i felt someone HAD MY person. I dont think i could ever tell her how i feel. Not unless we were p!ssed and we are like that a few times a month. Last time i was p!ssed and she was on my birthday a few weeks ago and i wanted to kiss her but i managed to stop. I dont understand why i feel like this please someone offer my some advice or something.      Thank you soo much x

20090305085835AAL01iP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you think I should do?	Okay. This is going to be long. Me and my girlfriend were going out for a year and 2 months. We just broke up a month ago. We broke up and she told me to leave her alone and everything. But I didn't at first. But I ended up leaving her alone. We would talk here and there though. Two weeks after we broke up she got with some one else. It hurt and I was really mad. Cause we both loved each other. And she moved on so fast. Well long story short. Im pretty much in a love triangle with her and her bf. All three of us go to the same school. Me and her act like we are together when we hang out and stuff. We stay afterschool together. We kiss. We hug. We hold hands. But anyways. She tells me she loves me and that she wants to be with me. But idk if she really means it because she still is still with the other guy. I asked her why is she still with him though. And she says that she's been trying to break up with him but that she can't do it. Tomorrow they are going to have 3 weeks together. And yesterday the other guy told her(my ex) the he loves her. I don't know what to do anymore. if I should wait to see what happens between us or if I should just move on. I lover her more than anything and she means the whole world to me. But I just don't know what to do anymore. Can you give me any advice. Me and her talk all the time. I walk her to two of her classes. And I stay with her afterschool. And we talk on the phone at night and when she gets home. We text all the time. Im just really confused. If you need any additional details, ask and I'll give you more info :]. Thanks.

20090305084735AA1wCM4	Family & Relationships;Weddings	How should I handle it?	I work at a daycare and I'm a teacher for toddlers (12-18 months).The daycare/preschool that I work at doesn't allow you to put them in time out or take anything away from them unless they had put it in their mouth. Well there's this one little girl that doesn't listen worth a crap! And it bothers me that you can't do much about except say "STOP!" but she still doesn't listen. She's my responsibility so they can't take her out of the room. Her mom and dad are amazingly nice. How can they have a devil child. She throws thing and pulls other kids' hair and smacks them in their face, bites and she rips all the art work off of the walls. And she throws herself on the ground when you try and pick her up for a diaper change or something. If I can't put her in time out or take her out of the room, what do I do?

Anyyyywwaaayyy she sent me an email a little while ago,and asked me about all this stuff...So HER question came down to:"How can i get what i really want from god? How do i know if he is talking to him?" We [of course] both are HUGE fan's of Daron Malakian,but i'm not IN LOVE [i like him a little] with him..Katy is,and she told me this:"I begged god,for him to send me to starbucks in glendale,california to find Daron Malakian there,then he offers me some coffee,blah,blah,blah [after awhile of her typing a lotsa stuff i finally read] Me and Daron get married and i have his babies,and he goes back  to looking like he did in 2001 and 2002." trust me that EMAIL WAS LOOOONG!! I know katy is completely head over heels for him...she is crazy as hell,but she is freaking out...she said she didn't know what god sounded like,or what he would say...or if he said anything to her at all..or if he was listening,etc. please don't leave hate,my friend just really wants to marry daron malakian,and all that stuff. I know i know it's a crazy dream,but it's hers anyway...[?] haha,so yeah if you had ANY personal experience where you talked to god,and got a response,and got what you REALLY wanted from him..then yea...PLEASE TELL ME,Poor Katy is freaking out. :(

20090305075938AAIUVsO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you consider this cheating?	-Giving ur ex girlfriend a hug.   -Letting a girl sit in ur lap.   -Telling other girls they're hot.   -Calling other girls at night and talking to them like they're ur girlfriend.   -Calling other girls sweetheart, baby, sweet pea, etc.   -Getting drunk with a girl & then making out.      Also, would you be mad if you was at ur boyfriend's house and you seen him texting his ex girlfriend, and then got mad at him, and while you and him was arguing he gets on the phone with that girl and is right in front of you and is laughing with this other girl on the phone and talking about you.

20090305080033AAPNGSr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I miss him so much! Please help me!?	Hey and thanks to anyone who answers this. This summer I became very close with my friend, her boyfriend, and her boyfriend's friend. We would drive from here to there (which I loved because I'm only 14 and they're all 17 so I enjoyed the whole "them having cars deal"... haha I'm over that now but that was a pretty big deal!) and just do whatever we wanted. Uh... how do I tell you about the guy I miss so much I ache. He was an awesome guy who was always around and who I fell for very quickly. He was kind of a player who had a girlfriend, but he told us that he broke up with her. Just as well, I didn't care if he was cheating on her. I later found out that his girlfriend is actually a girl at my school... which makes things awkward. But I saw him all the time and he was just so sweet to me. But one night at a football game, he got into a fight and the cops hand cuffed him. He got suspended for I don't know how long and when him mom found out she flipped and kicked him out (that was a long time coming I'm guessing). He then moved many states away and moved in with his dad. Two months later, during Christmas vacation, he moved back but he moved in with a friend and started going to a different school. He later told my friend that her boyfriend was cheating on her and that ended the friendship between her boyfriend and this guy. I havn't seen him since September... infact nobody has. I miss him so much. We had a bit of a friends with benefits thing going on. I never had sex with him because he would be drunk a lot but I think we eventually would have if this whole thing hadn't come to an end.

He broke up with me yesterday and said he needed to be with him self right now, he also cried, said that it scared the **** out of him to think of us not getting back together, and told me i have been the perfect girlfriend for him, but he is in no condition to treat me good.  I am fine with a break if that's what he needs to stay sober, i want that for him.  But i can't figure out if this is permanent or not.  I would also like to add that we broke up for 2 weeks when he got out a rehab for this same reason.

She was extremely distant, moody, cold, mean and insulting the entire night. When we got back to her house she told me she had to work the next morning and that she'd get better sleep if I didn't stay over (the first time this has ever happened in 3 months. i always stay over). I was drunk, but she didn't seem worried about me getting a dui or in an accident. she then called me as i was walking to my car and asked me to come back and hang out a little longer. i was pissed, but i went back thinking she may have realized what she did. after no more than 10 minutes she said she was going to bed and kicked me out again. I've never been so angry with anyone's selfishness, let alone someone who's supposed to care about me. i haven't spoken with her since saturday. she texted me yesterday but i gave her single-word replies until she got the hint and left me alone. should i call and confront/break up with her or should i keep blowing her off until she calls me and try to work it out?

They didn't start off as dates or anything, it just went straight to it.  So I'm a little inexperienced when it comes to actually asking girls out.  It's easy once you already have a girlfriend.  So there's this girl that I like, and I don't think it's just going to happen like the others I've had, so I was wondering how I should ask her out and what a good first date would be?

My ex's solicitor has just mailed me parenting orders, but i don't agree with them. he wants 8 hours every sunday, building up to 50/50 custody.There was a history of violence and abuse in our relationship, but i left before our daughter (10mnths) was born. he was alcoholic and addicted to marijuana and pornography, and some things he told me indicated tendencies to pedophilia. i never reported the abuse to the police during our relationship (apparently this is very common), and the only witness was a relative of his, who would never betray him. he was coming to my house to visit baby for first 4mnths, and being supervised by my parents, but he was intimidating and manipulative and used the police to intimidate me (welfare checks for no reason), so on police advice, i stopped contact. i was able to get supervised contact once a fortnight, and he agreed to it, he has been seeing her there since then. we tried mediation, (he applied at relationships australia) but were told it is inappropriate considering abuse, although i did convince them to try, and did it over phone from home whilst he was at mediation centre. The mediators decided it wasn't working and gave us certificates. i applied for an AVO for stalking behaviour 4 mnths ago, but was denied (was told yesterday that i was denied incorrectly, i should have got it, but it has been too long now since last incident so i can't get one). i have been told that as i have no hard evidence of abuse, and no unbiased witnesses (my parents witnessed intimidation and he admitted some things he had done to them), he will get everything he is asking for. i have seen two solicitors now, and they both say the same. i'm desperate, deeply depressed, unable to function, i rarely leave the house... any advice - please help, i don't know what to do and i am so scared. i can't hand my daughter over to him, but i can't prove anything, so what can i do? i feel so hopeless! it's my job to protect her, not put her in danger

20090305085059AAaWDM2	Family & Relationships;Friends	What's the deal with female friends?	Me and my husband have two couples that we hang with all the time. A couple months ago one of the wives took my husband aside and told him she thought their might be something going on with her husband and myself. I was very upset and after trying to convince her for weeks there was not I gave up. I ended the friendship. Now me and my husband hang out with the other couple every weekend and have a blast. A few days ago I kept texting my female friend and she never replied. So I then text her husband to see what they were doing. She completely freaked out. She told me not to be randomly texting her man, and it was not cool and completely went off the deep end. At first I thought she was playing and was playing back, but she was for real. She told me nothing was gonna get started up under her nose. I told her if she didn't trust me then we didn't need to be friends and she agreed. So now we've lost our friends. My husband is upset and doesn't understand the big deal since she texts him all the time. He tells me not to worry about it, and that we'll get new friends to hang out but I'm worried it's always gonna be this way. Me and my husband are always together, and I'm not a flirty person. Why are females so insecure and jealous?

Yes, i know, you don't need a boyfriend to be happy. But i want one, i want a change. My problem, is that guys ALWAYS like my friends. They ask for their numbers, they ask them to hangout, random ones talk to them also. Guys don't do that to me. They just see me as a friend, the "cool" girl. Guys that i don't know won't approach me, unless I'm with my friends. Yes, i do talk to them. They just never quite seem to like me like that. Has anyone ever been like this?
20090305085748AArGye7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do i feel like this now?	I broke up with my girlfriend of 2 years about a month ago and and felt like i had wanted to for a while. I ended it becuse of her obsessiveness and insecurities ruining my life. I had just turned 18 and couldn't go out or even really speak to other girls and always on edge. If anyone attractive appeared on TV it would ruin the night. So i broke up with her and felt relief ever since and a sense of freedom and happiness. So why now do i feel a sudden sadness and jelousy whenever i see her? Why now? I was perfectly fine until one morning when it just hit me and i cant help reminiscing about the good times.

I obviously undrestimated the cost of the dump( like i knew) so he loaned me some cash which i gave back when we got home. this put him behind 1/2 day on his previous project. the truck n trailer hauls dbl. the fuel to do this, this caused him grief as he put it. initially i was upset cause he offered to do this and if it was to cause this much grief then why do it? I felt terrible. because my last boyfriend 2 yrs ago. would offer to do things for me but in the end make me feel bad or like i owed him somthing??? So what point did i miss???

20090305090548AAWuvIn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I being too sensitive or is something weird going on?	Here's the deal, My boyfriend has a new dentist and he went for a cleaning yesterday. He had a root canal scheduled today and I was supposed to drive him. Well he came back from the cleaning yesterday and we were talking and he mentioned going for the root canal the next day and he was talking about me driving him. And he said when we get there I could sit out in the car, he seemed kind of concerned about where I would be sitting while he had his appointment. I think he had forgotten he had asked me to drive him to the appointment. I said just kind of kidding around "why, you don't want people to see me?" and he said "oh no, it's uh just because they have these straight backed chairs, not very comfortable"       Well I thought that was kind of wierd and it kind of got my nerves up but ok, whatever. I let it go. But later on he starts talking about this dental hygienist who he says was talking about all her husband, how he has an anger problem, how he hits the kids, she was acting kind of in denial about it being a "real problem". He was concerned.       So ok I said to him here's what you need to do, get the phone number for her to get counseling and let her know if it is found the kids are being abused and she did nothing to stop it she will be  held liable also.       So I looked up some info and sent it to him by email to give to her the next day when he would see her again. Well the next day comes and I drive him to the appointment and walk into the office. I wanted to see what it was like, if it was as uncomfortable as he said.       Well that place is gorgeous. Yeah there are a few straight back chairs but also several really comfy chairs and the place is really decorated beautifully. I mean who wouldn't want to sit in there! Especially when it's kind of cold outside and he's going to be in there two hours!       So, ok, the question comes to mind again. Why did he not want me to sit in that waiting room?? I am not ugly and I don't smell. I felt really insulted like either he is ashamed of me or that maybe there is more going on between him and this hygienist than he let on.       Anyway he got done with his root canal, I drove him home and walked home to my house feeling really really ticked off. I didn't say anything to him more about it except when we got there I did comment about what a nice waiting room it is and why would I want to sit in the car? He made it sound like he didn't notice all the other nice chairs in there. I am not feeling good about this. It seems like something is going on here. Please tell me what you think, I know how I feel but I want someone else's persepective here.

Basically, what has happened since then is that I found out the my best friend was actually lying to me. She told me the truth a week ago. She had actually just thought that our flirting was "cute" so she thought it would be funny to tell me that he liked me... even though he NVR said that. she asked him if he cared and he said that he didn't care. Then she led me on that he liked me.   I ended up talking to him about the whole thing and he said he was sorry and that it really wasn't his idea. And he said nothing my friend had told me was true, but that he was cool to just be friends and joke around (flirt).      I am still kinda confused. I'm not sure what to do with all of this now. I still like him, and I think he actually does like me but just doesn't want me to know. What do I do?? He and I are back to normal, and I'm trying to be normal with my friend but I'm pretty pissed... What do I do now??

20090305091038AAvM1xP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to win him back...?	Ok, here's the story...      I met this guy about 8 months ago...we fell in love really fast...he proposed after 2 months (with one of my family rings)....we broke up because of how he treated me...a week and a half later we got back together and things were great with promises of treating each other better...3 months later he propsed again (properly this time, bought a ring and propsed really sweetly)...things were great until we started planning the wedding and we both wanted something totally different, he wanted something small and nice and i wanted something big and nice....we fought quite a bit and a lot of happened...we broke up again about a month and a half ago...well a week ago i dropped some of his stuff back off at his house and then ended up seeing him shortly afterwards...we talked about getting back together and have been talking about it ever since...he just is unsure if we can really be happy together because we are very different (I'm the outgoing one and he's pretty quiet...he likes the quiet life and i've always lived the busy life)...all I want is to be with him and for us to be happy.  We both know we love each other a tonne!!!      he's given us 2 weeks to figure it all out...basically its up to him making a decision.  The last week has been great...we've gone out and done some fun spontaneous things together and I'm planning a day date for us this saturday....      I want this date to win him back!!!!  I need some good ideas...   Our first date (the day we met--cause we met online) was at the zoo....and then our first real date was him taking me to hard rock cafe, his favorite resturant and then to the bluffs for a walk and long talk...it was really romantic...      I have some ideas for this date...i was thinking of picking him up, going to the zoo where it all began, then heading to the bluffs for a walk and then taking him to hard rock cafe for dinner and then i'm not sure what else...      Is this a good idea...taking him back to where we began?  Or should I do something different?      I love this guy beyond what I can actually describe!!!!

20090305091309AAh64hS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why so few girls approach guys?	I've always wondered the reason why the majority of girls don't approach guys.  Is it because it's the guys' job to initiate the conversation, girls don't want to seem desperate, or because girls are afraid of rejection.  Now I could understand the first two reason, but if the real reason is the 3rd (afraid of rejection), then that just don't make sense.  Now I could understand if the girl feels that she may not be as attractive as the guy she has interest in, but there are many girls out there that are very attractive (and knows it) that do not approach guys.  Mind you, when I say approach, I mean initiating the first "hello" or conversation.  So I don't see those attractive ladies being afraid of rejection because I'm sure they know they won't get rejected, unless the guy is taken which is not a bad reason for rejection.  To the attractive ladies, is fear of rejection a reason for you to not approach a guy?

20090305091639AAIWS6X	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Help! 4 bridemsaids's, 2 are pregnant! 1 will have a newborn during the wedding and the other will be 6 months?	I am asking this on behalf of my SIL and brother (Their the ones gettign hitched). There are only 4 bridesmaids. 1 (the MOH) is very pregnant and will have a 3 month old when the wedding happens, the other BM  just annouced her pregnancy and will be 6 months.   This is the problem.... this particular BM had a pregnancy scare 2/3 months ago that would have put her at 8 months for the wedding. The bride was upset, but couldn't voice it (especially since we all found out last weekend that they were trying again and look.. now she's preggers).    This BM just had a baby last year. It was a difficult pregnancy that she had to take the last 4 months off and suffered from PPD after.... which she just had treated and was already weaning herself off her meds against her physicians request ( and she's a nurse!)   We've already accepted that the MOH will not be able to contribute as she will be very pregnant & will have the newborn and she is in another wedding too. But now bro and SiL are upset because they feel that now only the two BM's will help and the only reliable groomsmen. They don't understand why this couple (The BM and Hubby are both in the wedding) couldn't have waited at least a few more months to try. The BM is very excited to be in the wedding as this will be her first as a BM.    But my SIL and bro are very unsure if they should ask them to leave the wedding or not.    HELP!

20090305095311AAHzL7E	Family & Relationships;Friends	School problems at the minuit what could i do to solve them?	Theres two major (well i say major but hey might not see like it to you) problems at school.      The first...   My best friend fell out with me last friday because i was quite grumpy in PE. Shes gone of with my other friends who actually are my friends and not hers. They believe her side of the story and shes told them some lies to make her look more innocent and me more evil. I don't know why shes suddenly doing this, pathetic. Everyone asked her why she fell out with me and she told them the new 'story' about how im always controlling her and how i ditched her in PE when i didn't. Everybody hates me even some of my friends. Then today one of my friends listened to my side of the story and went over to them and we both explained. Everyone one was ok with me but Gemma refused to make up with me saying i always get the grump if we don't do things my way so untrue. So then im hanging out with all of them (around 18) plus my old best friend, not the most comfortable of things let me tell you. It was all fine and then after fourth lesson (lesson after dinner) she starts crying and everyone crowds round her and she tells them how im trying to split her and MY friends up, she also said that i threatened her which i so did not im so not that kind of person. Now we're back to square one everyone hates me i hates me i have no friends and my best friends a sweet and innocent girl who behind all the purple hair dye and spots is hatching plans to make me look bad. :(      Ploblem number 2.....      My cousins friend has been posting nasty messages on peoples bebo and its only really me who messages her, so all the people think i set up a false account and is doing all the nasty messaging. I told her to stop it because its people she doesn't know they're from my school and think its me. Worst of all they've told everybody so practically the whole of my year hate me for supposedly being nasty to Gemma and creating a false account and calling people names on bebo.      Roll on college :'(

20090305092925AAXjJK1	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am I wrong for being so upset with him?	So i'll try to make this as short as possible since no one likes a question that goes on forever.      So my mom lives in a town house. My sister used to live in a condo in the same town. Mom owned the condo, sister paid her for it. Sister ends up moving out and screwing mom over, so mom is forced to find a renter. Well the washer and dryer in the condo is crap, so mom gets my husband and his brother in law (who even own a delievery business) to swtich the stacked washers and dryers from each house. It was a horrible job, each house has a bunch of stairs and the doorways were all almost too small.      Now, Mom has been having terrible luck. Almost every appliance in the renters house has broken, moms dishwasher leaked and destroyed her kitchen floor, and mom is running out of money and unwillingly have to lean on her boyfriend for finacial support.       Now the condo's washer and dryer is broken, and it needs to be replaced. Mom can't afford to loose this renter. Mom needs to put the stacked washer and dryer from her house into the renters condo. She doesnt have many connections and my husband refuses to help her again.  His brother in law will not help, husband hasnt even helped me try to find other options. Mom's boyfriend is unable to help, he is nearly 60 and lives in a differnt city. We live in a small town and I cant find any movers, and any out of town mover would charge her up the ***. She has no other options, but my husband doesnt seem to care. He is bascily helping to screw her over. I know he'd never leave his mom in this kind of situation.      Am I wrong for being so upset with him?

Then out of nowhere, she tells me that she's been thinking about her death alot recently, and then she starts laughing hysterically for about half a minute, I didn't know if she was laughing or crying at the end.      I told her that I didn't like her thinking like that, then she pulled herself together, and said she meant that she was comfortable with the idea of her dying. I don't know if I am partly responsible for how she feels, but I try to tell her  every time I talk to her how special and wonderful she is. I am worried though, she's always had psyche problems because she was previously abused by an ex. But I am really worried now...is she suicidal?

20090305101130AAmk4pl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Was he emotionally abusive?	I dated this guy on and off for several months. At first it was casual and I lost my virginity to him and became extremelly attached to him. He would tell me that he has such a busy schedule, with school and work and he said that if he didnt call me for days, I shouldnt be mad at him. I would only see him about once or twice a week on avarage and whenever him came over, we ended up having sex. He would call me a ***** sometimes but then would say, "You know Im joking, I dont mean it." And when I finally told him that I want an official relationship or thats it, he asked me to be his gf. We then had sex once again but then, he somewhat changed. He said that we shouldnt do it anymore so he can really get to know me. So we didnt do it for about a week and thats when he stopped calling. I finally called him up and asked what was going on and he said that he didnt want a girfriend right now. I guess I put up with all of his crap because I was madly in love with him and couldnt really face reality. Was I blinded by love? Was I really in an emotionally abusive relationship?

I'm 24 years old, I'm searching for a new girlfriend who are younger than my age perhaps 18-22 because I love to treat her like a baby angel, I don't like girls older or at my age because it makes me feel old.  Is it Ok if I dress like an emo and put some eyeliner?  Do girls like guys dress like emo but not really an emotional guy who cuts his wrist, have a sense of humor like a happy-go-lucky guy similar to Jim Carrey?  I always talk with people and cheer them up with jokes, even some of them are corny.  Is it ok to be like this?  I really like to be what I am today but some people think that I am too old for this stuff, even some of my friends does not know any emo bands because all they like to listen to are Reggae songs, I do like reggae and other kinds of music.  Am I too old to be like this?  When I asked this question, the song what's my age again by Blink 182 came in to my mind.  If I stay being like this at my age, will it scare 18-22 year old hot girls, or do girls at these age like hot emo-dressed dude with an anime style hair because I love to dressed like this and meet them and pick the best baby angel for me.  Thank you.  Lots of love. xoxo

We both liked each other & we meet at a party that my sister and her husband had at there house. My bother in law cannot stand him or his family. They said that he was no good, & to stay away from him but we both like each other, his 27, & Im 21 and he is so sweet & very successful. We meet up after the party, he told me how he felt, and I liked him because of this amazing connection we had. He told me everything about his life & how he messed up but he said that he changed and he takes depression pills because of a bad childhood and he was always been put down. He said that he would meet       my mom and dad but I said no because my brother law would beat him up and hurt him if he knew that he was dating me, my sister cannot stand him there is too much feud between the two families. It has caused many problems for him and me: we both knew that we had to keep this relationship a secret. However, my sister found out and she discovered our secret, because his cousin witch is my brother in laws brother went and told my sister…his he trusted his cousin because he thought he was his friend but he betrayed him and they have made my life miserable. We are not been able to see each other. Both of these families are very stubborn neither my sister nor brother in law will accept this relationship. they have threatened me and him. However, my Mom & dad are cool with it but they told me to end it because they know that my brother in law hates him so I just said that I would but I have not, they have told him so much lies about me and they told me so much lies about him but in secret… I still talk with him over MSN…he said this… if its meant to be it will happen but he said that he likes me & still has feelings for me but its killing him because he knows that its never going to workout because of all the hate and bullying and he said that he couldn’t handle all this trouble. But he said that he couldn’t get me out of his head and he said that he would tell no one that where talking and I said the same. He waits for me all day on MSN just so he can talk with me and he even talks with me on the phone when his at work. He is a big boss as well as the owner at his company, he doesn’t need this stress, and he said that he wants to give this a chance but he does not know what will happen and he does not want them to hurt me or him? What do I do?

What would you think if you went on a vacation with your girlfriend for 4 months and you went on vacation and stayed in a nice suite and she said jokingly "How about we just stay here? I can transfer schools and finish up school here and you can get stationed(military) here and we can live in this nice suite and i'll make you dinner every night" me and my boyfriend are going to disney world in three weeks and we have an amazing suite, i'm getting to where i'm having serious thoughts about someday making things permanent, would he get the point or will it freak him out. how would you feel if your gf or bf said that to you?       **we started dating with the understanding that we're not dating just to date, we're dating to see if we want to marry each other**

He is always tired when he gets back and never wants to do anything. all his money goes on bills so we dont do much on his days off.   ive ran out of my own money now. coz of his wage i cant qualify for any benefits so i am now reliant on him for money and i find it so hard to ask him.   I dont know anyone here. i spend my time lookig for work or on facebook catching up with my friends who i miss so so much.      im thinking about moving back. i dont want to lose him but i am struggling to stay here.      what do you think?

20090305094505AAw6Khs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do I think like this about women?	When I was enrolled in college every time I took a break outside in between classes I noticed that some of the women that were in medical class were calling eachother bi *** or slut puppy or ho bag. Except for one I noticed that she had a little more self respect for herself and others. I never really called a woman these names, sure I was cheated on twice by 2 different women and I was upset but I could not bring myself to call them those names.       2 of my sisters call each other ho bag or slut puppy because it upsets my step mother because she is christian. I noticed a difference between my little sister and my other sister. My little sister seems to have more self respect than my other sister. She is not judgemental and she dont put other people down. She has had some abusive boyfriends to and she was concidering thinking she was all those bad names but I told her dont think that way about yourself because when you do find a man he probably wont think that way about you and thats when you have found a real man. I have allways kept that in my mind. As for my other sister Im not sure what to do. She has had some abusive boyfriends as well and she is judgemental about everything. Why do I not want to call women bad names when they do me wrong or why dont I want to hear anyone else call women these names?

20090305100104AAB6Z3T	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Was it a date? He was acting more like a friend?	This is the most confused I've been in a looooong time! I hung out with this guy a couple of times, as friends. (or so I thought) Every couple of months he would ask me if I wanted to see a movie, or stop by a bakery or something. Sometimes he would pay for me, other times he didn't. He would compliment my hair or my clothes, but would never try to kiss me or even look at me "that way."       So a few weeks ago he asked me to go to this pre-Valentine's Day party, and since I don't feel romantically toward him, I (very nicely) told him I couldn't go. I also told him I couldn't afford this weekend trip he wanted to go on bc the economy's rough.       He hasn't spoken to me since. I think he's mad at me and I don't know what I did wrong! He wasn't letting me know if he was interested or not. He was acting more like a friend than a date. Guys, girls, anyone? Help!       I was afraid to ask him right out because I might look like an idiot. I still want to be friends with him and I feel like now he wants nothing to do with me.

20090305101036AAkFe41	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My ex traded his wedding band in for a Rolex the week after our wedding?	My (ex)husband and I kind of eloped. We planned a wedding in Maui, just the 2 of us. It was non-traditional and fast but I wanted to surprise him with a wedding band (he gave me his deceased Mom's modest ring which at the time I thought was sweet...later I think he was just being cheap, he was well off and not sentimental at all). I bought him a $1500 platinum band (I had to finance it). After a few days I didn't like the way the surface was scratching so we took it back to choose a new one. The salesman noticed him looking at watches and managed to talk him into (not that it took much convincing) a wedding watch instead. I was a little stunned but I didn't want to seem old fashioned or bitchy. He paid the extra 3k and upgraded his wedding band to a nice Rolex. I never questioned it.       Years later I realized what a selfish person (not to mention cheater) he was through our whole marriage. When we divorced I returned his mother's rings but of course I never got any part of his ring back.       What do you think of a wedding watch instead of a band in general? Do you think him trading in his band should have sent off warning signals in my head?

20090305094115AACQP6J	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He wants me but he won't commit?	what does it mean when a guy won't tell you why you and him aren't official yet? i mean in the past, i've gotten: "friends with benefits to a relationship doesn't work" or "i'm going to college"...basically usually if a guy tells me that he doesn't want a serious relationship he'll tell me why. however with this guy i've been seeing now it's the exact opposite...he says he wants to be with me but he won't tell me why he won't take the next step and just commit. i thought it could be the whole black/white thing....i know he doesn't care about it but his family may...and they are really important to him understandably. while possible, why else do you think a guy won't commit to someone even though he'll say he wants to be with them and he's always talking about how awesome he thinks you are.
20090305101127AAUgBsU	Family & Relationships;Friends	What should I do..? He's a good friend of mine..?	Okay, so theres this guy at uni whom Im friends with. Honestly, I dont see him as anything else except a friend. But now a days I get this "vibe" that hes into me. Its kinda strange coz we've been friends for about 7 months & nothing was suspicious as such. But of late, he seems to remember every tiny thing that I say..he volunteers to do my work..stares at me & smiles cutely when I catch him staring..he's been asking me all sorts of personal questions, subtly though.       Like the other day, he said "we wont be in teh same class from next semester on..i'll miss you..im so happy we met.."      Hes a nice guy, not at all pervy. But I dont like him in that sense. I've come to know he's planning to ask out his "crush"..I dont know if that is me, but if he does ask me out, I wanna say "no" but still not hurt him. Any suggestions? Have you been down that lane before? What did you do, then? Please advice. I'm reposting this coz I need more answers.      No need to be rude, please.

She came back in the house and said she was moving out because of this and started grabbing her things.

Trouble is after 2 hours of being pissed out in my room she comes back to me and now tries to make up.  She made me cry with her words while she was mad but then tried to change her mood to miss sweetie ...... What would you do?

20090305094000AACOKzP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Recently back with my ex and now I need to know how to trust him again.?	He dated a lot more people than he fessed up to and some where just one night drunk flings.  I don't trust him when he goes certain places because he most likely runs into these girls.  ...we were separated 3 years and we both dated but he lied about his many dates and was trying to get back with me the whole time.  He made me feel bad because he was pointing the blame at me for dating but it was actually him that dated many, many girls who he kept secret.  I'm guessing he was feeling better to make me look like the bad person and him like the less guilty one.     How do I make myself feel better about him being in these places where he most likely has contact with these girls?  We have went to therapy but he absolutly hates it and we do get along very well when he's not on the spot about his dating history.  I really just want to raise my kids in a 2 parent home but I'm going absolutly nuts not knowing if he is lying again.  How can I feel less uncomfortable about this?      I have anorexia and when under stress its so much worse so I'd like to be able to get some good advice to make myself feel better when he's in contact with these girls.  The contact is at social events and I don't and won't go everywhere with him.

20090305052239AArGg93	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Am I thick or just plain stupid?	My hubby works away form home and has done for 20 years and when I told him I was totally fed up with this life style the abuse starts and he accuses me of getting on to him when he comes home. When in fact all I want is someone to take me out and have a converstation instead of him sitting drinking pint after pint on a Saturday and moaning if I ask him to come shopping with me.       Am I being too selfish in expecting this. I spend the week-end washing ironing and cooking for him. Not that I mind but I need a soul mate to talk to too.       We live in Scotland which is lovely but we are away from family. I try to get out in the week but it is difficult. Not much fun on your own all the time. I'm retired and live in a very isolated community so I hardly ever see anyone.       So again am I thick in expecting too much of my hubby at the week-end. He enjoys being in his own home (understandable after being away all week) , however even if he would come for a walk with me I would appreciate that but he will not. He's says I ought to be grateful as not many men would do what he does for me! Huh???      Any suggestions please.
20090305094620AA5K00b	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Husband's 40th birthday?  Need advice from men and women, please!?	Husband will celebrate 40th birthday soon.  Has taken a few weeks off to spend at home.  Will leave to Las Vegas for 5 days for birthday.  Wants me to leave with him and return before the weekend.  Can't get childcare for 5 days and kids have activities we need to drive them to.  I feel torn leaving kids behind for 2 nights.  Kids have practices, homework, and games during the week.  Don't like the idea of dumping them on grandparents while I'm off in Las Vegas.  Husband really wants me to go.  He works VERY hard and deserves this trip.  Not sure if I should go.  Advice, please.  THANKS

I just had to do it today and i can tell you how hard it is....it was my brother who passed away on the 14th last month....im all alone now he's gone..its been very heart breaking.
20090305101229AAgDM3T	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why did he react to me this way? Do you think he is fed up with me?	Okay so I am married and have been for just 2 years but together for a total of 10 years. I have a very close guy friend that I have been friends with for quite some time. However, something happened recently and I am unsure what to make of it. Me and my husband sometimes have issues because he likes to go out a lot and I allow him because I don’t want to cause fights and I know he does deserve to have fun although last year there was an incident that gives me reason to not trust him because he was caught red handed doing something wrong but I chose to forgive him and move on.    In any event my best guy friend does know about this because I needed someone to talk to and vented to him at the time. Well the other night my guy friend asked how me and my husband were doing I said we are okay you know that my husband still likes to go out a lot but you know things are ok. Well my friend then kind of went of on me he said the following to me in a way of a rant in a bit of a feisty voice:      “You are a dream wife. But you know what in this case especially if someone wants to take advantage of you I think things are your fault to because you don’t yell at your husband and tell him he can’t go out and question what he was doing. You know you aren’t his property that he can think he can just put you up on a shelf to wait around while he goes out and has fun and then take you down from the shelf whenever he needs you for minute. Your not just something on the floor for him to step over or through in the wash machine whenever he feels. You know I see you 30 years down the line in the same situation still married to him meanwhile he has had 3 kids with other women and bunch of diseases and your still going around like “tra la la la la” I know you won’t admit it but you are just to afraid to leave, I know you love him but I know your not happy but you are just to scared to leave him. You never will. And I am telling you this because I don’t want you to ever say to me “well you never said anything” because honestly if your husband isn’t listening when you tell him how you feel well then he is just stupid”      Since then he has been distant and ignorning me when I text him so yesterday I gave him a hard time about ignoring me I was just trying to be silly and he responded and said "What do you mean ignorning you? And last I checked your husband was "name"      What is up with him? I don't understand why he is being so hard on me and doesn't seem to want to be my friend?

20090305094338AAcHfM7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need some help on what to do about ex?	Okay. This is going to be long. Me and my girlfriend were going out for a year and 2 months. We just broke up a month ago. We broke up and she told me to leave her alone and everything. But I didn't at first. But I ended up leaving her alone. We would talk here and there though. Two weeks after we broke up she got with some one else. It hurt and I was really mad. Cause we both loved each other. And she moved on so fast. Well long story short. Im pretty much in a love triangle with her and her bf. All three of us go to the same school. Me and her act like we are together when we hang out and stuff. We stay afterschool together. We kiss. We hug. We hold hands. But anyways. She tells me she loves me and that she wants to be with me. But idk if she really means it because she still is still with the other guy. I asked her why is she still with him though. And she says that she's been trying to break up with him but that she can't do it. Tomorrow they are going to have 3 weeks together. And yesterday the other guy told her(my ex) the he loves her. I don't know what to do anymore. if I should wait to see what happens between us or if I should just move on. I lover her more than anything and she means the whole world to me. But I just don't know what to do anymore. Can you give me any advice. Me and her talk all the time. I walk her to two of her classes. And I stay with her afterschool. And we talk on the phone at night and when she gets home. We text all the time. Im just really confused. If you need any additional details, ask and I'll give you more info :]. Thanks.

20090305093013AAGHyE2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why does society shun virgins?	I am a 19 year old male virgin who has never had a girlfriend.  This is partly due to my aspergers syndrome, which makes me socially awkward and causes me to be isolated from society.  I am fairly good looking (or so I've been told), probably a 7, and I think I have a good personality because people seem to like me.  I have a few female friends but they're all taken, and I don't have the guts to hit on anyone (they'd probably reject me anyway).      Is it weird that I'm 19 and still a virgin and have never had a girlfriend?  It seems like everyone has lost it except me.  I think there's something wrong with me.  I'm not actually that avid about it, though, I mean I'd like fooling around with friends or a girlfriend, but I'm not really that interested in going all the way (though I'd want to eventually, like before I turn 25).  But I feel so much pressure to lose my virginity.  When I'm with other people and I do something retarded they're like "You're a virgin, aren't you.  I can tell."  It's really starting to get to me.  I feel like whenever people laugh at that movie The Forty Year Old Virgin, they're laughing at me.

20090305102023AAY0P5K	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why tons of American women are Overweight and they don't care?	The stereotype that foreigners have of us American, is kind of true. Wherever I go, i see overweight women. They seem happy and they don't care but I'm sure deep inside they want to be slim.. It's just that they don't want to do the right thing to achieve that.      And don't even say being fat is genetic. That's just an excuse.  I come from a family with many overweight people and I have bad knees, broken shoulder, bad back etc.. and i have managed to keep myself descently slim by eating well and doing as much exercise as i can( mostly light stuff but i try).      Many blame it on how American food  is loaded with sugar and stuff but that's again,, that's an excuse. It all comes with having will power to change your bad habits.. Because i used to be overweight at age 11 and i changed my habits at age 13 and I haven't been overweight ever since.      Those overweight American Women dont want to be beautiful? They dont want to be healthy and active?  Usually all  it takes is having fun and eating OK foods, and not sitting on the couch all day long. That's not much to ask.      I just don't get it.       i'm 29 male from america and I keep seeing how Women from  other countries are slim and that's just messed up how we can't be the same way.

20090305064322AAgMJmP	Family & Relationships	15 yr old wants to spend the night with girlfriend?	My 15 year old nephew is dating a 14 yr old girl. The girlfriends parents are divorced because her father left her mother for his gay lover. So now the father is living with his boyfriend.       Over the winter my nephew was at the fathers home with his girlfriend and the weather got bad so he asked if my nephew could spend the night with the girl sleeping in dads room and the boyfriend sleeping in the livingroom with my nephew. My sister said yes but felt very uncomfortable with this.       Now the father is asking if my nephew can spend the night at his house again this weekend with the 14 year old girlfriend (same sleeping arrangements). The father is asking because my nephew and his girlfriend are going to a movie Saturday night and he wants to make breakfast for these two on Sunday morning. My sister has said NO but the other adults (girls mom, dad and the boyfriend) don't think there is anything wrong with this.       What are you opinions on this?  I told my sister to limit how often my nephew has contact with this man because i find it odd that any adult would think it is ok for teenagers spend the night with each other.

20090305093330AAhMnEx	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Office hottie gone wild?	First, I’m happily married with 3 kids and a beautiful wife. But at work, I have this young 20 something sIutty office hottie that undresses me with her eyes all day long… she started to time her breaks to reflect my breaks.  She comes downstairs with me, when I’m skipping out for a cigarette. (even though she doesn’t smoke)   Just a few minutes ago, in the break room, she whips out a grape flavored Popsicle from the freezer, unwraps it, then she started licking it seductively right in front of me. Up and down the shaft of the Popsicle, tonguing the tip, the whole 9 yards. Then she tells me that she has a sore throat, and how the Popsicle relieves the pain.. And so she starts to deep throat the Popsicle… the dark blue melted grape Popsicle started to drip down the side of her face, running down to her skin clinging sleeveless top, at times, dripping down to her exposed silky smooth legs, just underneath her tight short mini skirt… and she looks at me with the most seductive look I’ve ever seen anywhere, and with her sexy smooth voice, she asks me if I wanted ‘some’. So, I said “of course!!!!”   Should I go for the Red or the Orange Popsicle?

20090305092725AA3Tyde	Family & Relationships;Family	Am I wrong to ask 12, 14 and 17 year old to do these chores to help out?	The 12 year old - to load up the dish washer every night, take the trash out, make his bed and help his dad to clean the windows once a month.      The 14 year old - put the dishes away, put washing from the machine into the dryer, help bathe the two and three year old with her 17 year old sister(They only do it friday night not every night) and to make her bed and fold washing.      The 17 year old - to help cook dinner, help bathe the two and three year old with her sister(Again only friday night), ironing washing (She only gets what's left over which is usually a couple shirts, some jeans and baby clothes), make her bed, dusting and vacuming. She also helps me get the younger children dressed and fed (she butters toast and pours milk on cereals) in the morning but I get them up. She just makes sure the 6,7 and 8 year olds are ok and dressed properly.      I asked this in the teen and preteen section but I got called lazy and not doing my job as a mum. My husband and I have 12 children aged 17, 14, 12, 8,7,6 4 year old twins, 3, 2 and 6 month old twins. My husband works long hours and works nights one week a month. I'm the one that drives everyone around, I do dusting and cleaning when the kids that are at home with me are napping so the 17 year old doesn't do it all. I don't just sit all day like people think I do.

She is 20 years old, and has a sister who is 22. Her sister can be very mean towards her a lot of the time, and she is getting pretty fed up (and hurt) with it. They  had plans to do something together this weekend. Now, my niece wants to cancel, due to a fight they had. Her mother is telling her to let it slide and go ahead with the plans. My niece doesn't want to even see her sister this weekend, but at the same time, doesn't want to go against her Mom.   I had the same problem with a different sister when we were teens, so I know exactly how she feels. I feel that she should do what she feels like doing, but don't want her Mom to know I told her that. (I haven't said anything to her yet). My mother used to tell me the same time about my sister (forget it -let it slide, etc.), but I know how difficult this is. Any suggestions on how to deal with this.

20090305092938AAHub3k	Family & Relationships;Friends	I have friend problems!?	Some of my friends and me are having a problom. See it started yesterday, our class went on a trip. Then today, miss told us that we did something wrong, and she took it the wrong way (she thought we were flirting with strangers). Then after yelling a bunch (some people in my class cried (including me). She was specificly yelling at one of my friends. When we were going to our next lesson, i told her that i felt bad for her. Then her other friend (not mine) said i should not rub it in. (rub what in?!) Then in class she said i was always rude and stuff, like i told her she wasn't good at jump rope(skipping), but it's not like i didn't let her try again!! And now i know that she's going to tell my other friends, and they wont be friends with me anymore. She will tell the whole class and no one will like me. And I hate feeling lonely, i mean throughout primary, i only had one or two friends, it was the sadest time of my life. I've tried putting myself in her shoes, but they dont seem to fit! What do I do!!!!!!?????????

20090305092909AASA6sC	Family & Relationships;Family	Can someone please help?	my mum and i never ever get on. It's like we're rivals, and I have a much stronger relationship with my dad.   she seems to be always rollling her eyes at me, or making snidy comments, or hurting me.   A lot of the time, we fight, and the aruguments aren't pretty at all. She says some horrible things to me and takes advantage of any trust I had in her in the first place and she takes the mick out of anything i tell her.   She always sides with my sister in arguments even when its blatantly her fault, and she takes every oppurtuinity she can to get at me, and speaks of me badly to my dad.   she also tells my dad that i upset her all the time and that i am spoilt, and then my dad bleieves her and always sides with her. And often i'm not allowed to go out with my friends at weekeneds because my dad has believed my mum.   We dont share anything, we have none of the same tastes at all, and were two completely different people. I dont feel like i want to share anything with her either.    she never has anything  nice to say about me. Just tonight we had a massive fight because im 15 in a couple of months and she still wants to know everything about my life when i dont want to share anything. like i said i was going to the mall and she said i wasnt going untili told her exactly what i wanted to buy, when i actually wanted to buy her a bday present ( her bdays in a few weeks). And it got pretty nasty and she always hits me and pulls my hair out and pushes me hard against walls and things, and i do it back too, but only out of self defence.   im sick of her trying to destroy the relationships i have with my dad, and i wish she would like me and be m friend like my friends mums.    please help?   xxxxxxxx

20090305095346AA7W670	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this a cute way to ask a guy to prom?	Okay so this guy and I flirt a ton. I like him, I am not quite positive where he stands. His school isn't doesn't have dances because it a very conservative christian school. He has been asked by girls to Sadie Hawkins a ton of times. He didn't actually say yes to them because he didn't like them. But he told me he wants to experience a dance. Finally he is a bashful guy. He is really outgoing but does not like people asking him personal things in front of people. He was totally embarrassed when someone asked him in front of the entire youth group at church.       So here is how I want to ask him. I want to go to a photo booth and hold up a different sign each photo.       Photo One: ________ (his name)    Photo Two: will you   Photo Three: go to    Photo Four: Prom?       this way i can give him it in a cute envelope and he does not have to answer right away, or open it in front of people. What do you think?
20090305092630AAU9ZXA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Me, My girlfriend, and multiple interlopers ...?	Hi, guys, I'm new here, and I need some advice. I have been in an awesome relationship, with this awesome girl, who we will call Ms. Pink. Okay, before, Ms. Pink and I started going out, I had several flirtationships with two or three girls before I took a serious interest in Ms. Pink. Originally, I had never really thought about Ms. Pink as Girlfriend material, but a delicious opportunity presented itself before me during the Summer of 2008, and I grasped at it gladly. Now the two girls I had formerly flirted with, especially one of them, threw a huge hissy-fit when I announced to both of them that I would be breaking off our flirting games to pursue an a relationship with Ms. Pink. (I had been dared to kiss them both, but broke that to pieces too, because, I don't roll that way when I'm in a relationship, hence the hissyfit). Anyways, Ms. Pink and I have been in a wonderfully fulfilling relationship for almost 8 months now, and I am EXTREMELY satisfied with our relationship. Ms. Pink and I have connected on a deeply personal basis. We have talked about everything, ranging from Marriage to School to Friends, We have talked about just about everything. We have talked on the telephone every day for the past 7 months and 20 some days. We have had phone conversations that ran from early evening to late morning. I am entirely devoted to her, and I love her with all my heart. And I truly believe she loves me the same way. However, at around our 6 month anniversary, things started to get really bumpy.       There has been this girl I have know for about three years. And from the very beginning of our "aquaintance", she has made it known that she is very into me. I on the other hand, looked with disdain upon her advances, which are too numerous to count. This girl, who we will call, The Troublemaker or Ms. T, as been hounding me, trying to get me to go out with her for 3 years now, and I constantly expressed my opinion, "I'm not interested." Anywho, it seemed Ms. T was not beaten down by the multiple rejections, rather, it seemed to fuel her, as if, maybe, I was playing hard to get. Anyways, things seemed to cool down as she started giving me the cold shoulder once I got with Ms. Pink. However, one fateful night, she accompanied my family and I to a family gathering, and was given the unfortunate opportunity to enjoy the hospitality of our humble abode with my sister for the evening. That very evening, she informed me of her desire to kiss me. I, not wanting to be mean, said very little to her regarding the matter, telling myself, I would simply avoid her and the matter would go away. Unfortunately for me, the matter did not go away, in fact, my apparent ignorance of her intentions seemed to drive her on, and she constantly reminded me during the evening of her insidious plans. Anywho, at some point of time during the night, she finally got the idea that I was not going to kiss her, so she decided to resort to ambushing me as I was coming from the bathroom. In all honesty, I can say, ladies and gentlemen, that this can be ranked as one of the worst things a human being has ever done to me before. I was honestly under the opinion that a dead fish was assualting my lips. After about 3 seconds of physical abuse so shocking that nausea followed, I pulled away, shocked and instantly realizing the implications of what had just happened.       Throughout my life, I have heard stories from women about how guys mistreat them and that "Guys are such Dogs" and from relatively early, I made up my mind that I was going to be the BEST man to whoever I was with. That included keeping my eyes firmly planted on my woman, not flirting with anyone, not allowing my self to even glance at the slightest movement of another woman. I would be a statue of firmness, and integrity, a man of my word, and a gentleman. After Ms. T's move, I realized that by not pushing her back, by simply standing there, doing nothing, allowing her to have her way, I failed myself, and Ms. Pink, and shattered all the goals that I had set for myself. However, I was determined to right my wrong, so, after, Ms. T tried and failed to kiss me again, the following morning, I informed Ms. Pink, of the goings-on of the past night. Now some of you may say I'm pretty stupid for that, but, I pride myself on being BRUTALLY honest with my GFs, telling them what they need to know, when they need to know it, where it needs to be told. The other reason being, that I did not want to give Ms. T the opportunity to inform Ms. Pink, of what happened, because, things would have turned out worst that they did.      Anywhos, as it happened, Ms. Pink, had news of her own, much to my dismay. Apparently, 5 months into our relationship or so, she informed me that she had begun falling for a best guyfriend of hers. This was only compounded by my news. Thus, I looked like the bad guy, and because, the Guyfriend played that age old line "I'll be here for you when you need me", and thus, I looked

I have a plan of getting him 18 gifts and delivering them to him different times throughout his day. With each gift I will be enclosing a note describing it.

20090305093140AA3cGhS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need help with this girl please?	so yeah, I know this girl from the last 3-4 years, and we've been hanging a bit more often lately, and I'm kind of attracted to her, well kind of is an understatement. but yeah, we're really good friends etc, etc, etc. Should I go ahead and let her know how I feel, considering she kind of had a crush on me 2 years back, but that was before she got into a bad relationship, that she just got out of 2 months back. She knows and has told me that I'm a good bloke, and went with me to this dance last month, and i have never felt more alive since forever.      She phones me 3-4 times a day, and even helped me get to the doc when i busted my leg. 2 weeks back we both met up to drink and had a heck of a time, and she came over to my place and watched a movie and slept over as well, and the next day aka Valentine's day she invites me to her place and we watch 3-4 movies and she made me dinner as well, herself in front of me......      I met her again the next day after that, and she seemed kind of off, but she didn't tell me why, it was only after i left her place, that she called me and kind of started crying over the phone, telling me how her ex used to beat her and cheat on her, and how she thinks there are no good guys left in the world anymore, following which she said i'm a good guy, but didn't say anything more. She also knows I've been involved with this chick 4 or 5 months bad that ended really bad too, and she tells me she's gonna forever hold a grudge against her for that.      but oh well, and over the last 3-4 days she's been saying "i love you too" when I didn't even say nothing in the first place. I guess she doesn't meant it, but then, i'm a pessimist.      we're meeting up again 2night, and on my birthday next week, should I tell her then, as we both are getting drunk?         sorry if its a long read   but i am totally clueless

20090305093826AAbnVCP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I Send Flowers?	I have gone out on few dates with this girl, shes 25 I'm 20. Our First date we Met for coffee second date we went out to dinner at a fancy restaurant, third date we went to the movies. We have a Fourth date planned for this saturday night dinner at another fancy restaurant. She    works in retail and I was thinking about sending her flowers at work this saturday do you think this would be a good move or a bad move? Befor this I was in a long term relationship for 3 years so I'm slightly rusty on the whole dating thing especially when your date is 5 years older then you. Any suggestions would be great! Also I'm finding it really hard to know how to pace it, obviously I don't wanna jump straight in the sack with her, we hugged after dinner on our second date and held hands at the movies on our third date, and hugged when saying good bye, I really wanted to give her a kiss but I don't know if I should or not. I guess dating a 25 year old is confusing me a little, but she is a really great girl. If you need any more information please feel free to ask.      Another quick question, how do you make the transition from dating to being girlfriend and boyfriend, it all seems alot harder then when I was 17 and you just asked some one out and BAM you were girlfriend and boyfriend

20090305093924AAq3R8r	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	NRI Doctor moving to Dubai?	I wanted to know that if I have trained in the US as a doctor, and after that move to Dubai and practice as a doctor there (American-Board Certified Doctors are highly regarded, respected, and well paid in Dubai) would marriage to an Indian girl from India become much more difficult? I know, that a lot of girls are attracted to coming to the United States and marrying an NRI doctor, but if I say that I plan to move to Dubai after finishing my training, are people going to be less interested.... Or would these girls, who are attracted to America attracted be equally attracted to Dubai?      I felt Dubai would be a better place to raise family as it is modern, safe, yet very Indian with majority of population being Indian... and it is very close to India so  getting to India would not be a problem at all. The only problem is that.... Its not America.
20090305093947AAGItf5	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do you get a husband to stop being SO selfish?	Me and my husband have been married for almost five years, and it seems like the more and more comfortable he has become with me his level of selfishness has risen.  Our baby is 8 mos old and now it is really hard for us to do things, especially together. To top it off my husband travels a lot for his job and is always out of town, but when he is in town, he insists on going right back out of town to go fishing and hunting. Of course i'm not allowed to go because of the baby or girls aren't allowed to go. So finally i planned my own trip to the beach with my friends a month in advance and sure enough he tells me he has to go out of town for work ( 2 days before I leave, no less!) and wants to leave the baby with his sister who is almost retarded, (not just exaggerating she can barely read!) and has a new born of her own. "That way I can still go and relax." he said. Yeah i'm sure i'll be at total ease. This is just one example of the many crappy stunts he pulls. I don't know what to do! HELP!                                                                  -K-

He told me he likes me very much coz I'm nice and that he would like to go out with me to the movies and do stuff after a week when he comes back from travel!   He even gave me his number. Anyways, after he got back from travels I waited for three months but he still didn't call. I keep calling him and sending him messages but no answer....   I'm so tired of waiting and thinking. I know I should move on...but first, should I confront him and ask why he did that, why he lied and kept me waiting all this time? Or should I just leave it at that and never look back??? And why do you think he lied?

I mean it, I love my boyfriend. I am hoping to get married soon. We each have a child from previous relationships, our families are close, and in general we are very happy. But we have opposite work schedules, and have very little physical contact. We do not live together. He has a coworker, who is also our friend, that I am attracted to, and he is to me. We have never discussed it, but it's like an undercurrent whenever we are around eachother. It's unavoidable. We kissed on the lips,quickly, and in front of our significant others (he's married to a real dandy, let me tell you) the other day, and I cannot stop thinking about it. I don't want to be with him, I don't want to leave our spouses and get together. I want to, well, kiss him a bunch, maybe, I don't know... What should I do? I absolutely CANNOT avoid this guy!

Kayla- Awesome as hell and has something with Lily      Me- Random emo/punk black chick that hangs with the two prettiest emo/punk/scene girls on the planet.  I can't even get 1/16 of the prettyness that they have...another words I'm ugly.      Anyhow I like two of Lily's ex's but she is all "That's kind of bogus considering their my ex's....but that would probably make you feel all special if you dated one of MY ex's wouldn't it?"    Super cocky right?   But then again who hasn't she dated that isn't hott (no offense to her) but like any guy that I basically think is hott she's already dated and he's off limits...which makes about 3/4 of the guys that are emo/punk whatever that live here.

He has been completely absent for the last 4 years (since before my son was born). He's now paid ONE support payment and thinks this entitles him to just take my son out for the day and have him spend the night.       I told him no, that he has to work up to it and build our trust as there is no visitation arrangement or custody order.  He doesn't want to come to my house to get to know his son, just be able to go off with him anywhere.      I live in Florida and he lives nearby in Alabama.
20090305094943AAZ5EFi	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My husband started drinking again and I don't know what to do.?	My husband has a drinking problem.  He has been through counseling, rehab, and even prison.  When we first started dating he was so against drinking, which was prefect for me because I don't drink.  On and off he has been drinking for the two years we have been together.  The drinking of course makes me mad, but for the most part I have just put up with it.  He is still on frederal probation, and two weeks ago he called me from jail, drinking and driving.  Everyone thinks I'm crazy for staying with him, but I have a son who calls him daddy and another on the way in 3months.  I feel like his mother and if I leave him he will destroy everything that we worked for.  He will have no one to answer too.  And honesty we need both paychecks.  Talking and family counsling helps for a little while, but hes going to do what he wants.  I'm just wondering if anyone out there can help?

20090305095237AAzTp40	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	HELP! How do we become more than friends?	Ok I'm 21 and my friend turned 21 about 6 months ago and we started going to the bars together with friends and his sister who is a year older than him. We'd go out at least once a week and I started to get to know her a little better. After a short time, I developed a HUGE crush on her, and honestly have never liked a girl this much in my life.      After a month or so my friend picked up on my thing for her and told me to ask her out. She acted like she wanted to go on a date and kept bringing it up, but when I asked her she said it wasn't a good time cuz she was trying to get her jerk ex off her mind.      Within the next couple months she seemed to flirt with me much less and got back with her ex for like a week then ended it. Then a little before christmas she started sending me texts asking when the date was. I hinted at wanting to go on the date without sounding desperate but she never followed up.       About a month later I joined the gym she goes to and I started seeing her there without her brother around. We seemed to have become better friends and she has REALLY picked up the flirting with me lately. The other night I went out to the bar with her with soem friends of mine (not her brother) and she said that we would make a good couple. I again didn't want to sound desperate and reminded her that she rejected me months ago but the conversation ended when we saw other people we knew at the bar. I slept over her house (on the couch, not with her) and she gave me a kiss goodnight on the forehead.      I want this girl real bad and have not stopped thinking about her for a good 6 months. I don't know how to approach the situation and would kind of feel weird dating my friend's sister, but would also be devastated if she started going out with someone else. What do I do?

C and I used to be part of the popular clique. Half way through, my clique didn't like C anymore. And so I chose to go with C over them. Then we became best friends.      Two months ago, I invited two classmates, A and D to join us. We became a small clique. My best friend C drifted away from me. C became closer to D even though we were supposed to be best friends. And everytime we walk together, she always ditches me for the rest.      I used to not be able to stand D, but now it's C I'm getting frustrated with. I asked her to choose between D and me. And she says she doesn't know. I mean, if I could choose her over my friends previously, why can't she do the same for me?        What are your views on this? What should I do?

20090305101608AAMmDu7	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is my husband abusive?? I can't seem to think anymore!?	We have been married for going on 12 years. When we first started dating I was 19 and wild as could be. I was never in a serious relationship before him, so of course...I didn't know what I was doing. When our relationship started I was going out to bars and parties. My parents were very strict with me growing up so when I turned 19 they finally let me go. Ever since then he has made me feel bad about going out like that. He has called me names, and said I put other people in front of him.      We have 3 children now and I haven't gone anywhere out like that since I was 19. All I do is take care of the kids and pretty much tend to him. I'm 33 now and he still goes on about how I don't put him first.  When we got married, I thought it would stop. I use to talk to this guy on the phone who I used to run around with when we first started going out. He gives me all lot of hell about him...still.  When I was with my boyfriend then (husband now), I didn't do anything with this guy. He just does not believe me   Anyways, since then (13 years ago) I have had panic attacks and was on antidepressants for a short time... they didn't help me. I am very depressed and I want to know if anyone has any answers? He has put me down so much. He doesn't believe a word I say.  He constantly thinks I want to have sex with his friends.(He is in the army). All I know is that I am a mother and a wife and I am so unhappy because of his thoughts of me. Everytime we fight...It goes back to when I was 19. I can't even talk to him because I hate myself so much.  I know I shouldn't but he makes it such a big deal in our lives. Can someone tell me what to do? I'm in pain all the time!

20090305101725AAih8Jj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am i a booty call? Signs of being one? Help?	I met this guy, hes really cool...weve been talkin for close to 7 months. The first date was fun, then the second date we started having sex. So from there after we would watch a movie and have sex.......its only been like 7 times. He says sweet things, like he wants to be with me, but actions speak louder then words. He doesnt mention a relationship, its gotten to the point where he only calls me when he wants to hook up. And one time after having sex he wanted me to go and i said: "Are you done with me?" He looked me straight in the eye and said: "No, those are not my intentions." So basically im torn, i like him and i think about him every single day, i sit around waiting for him to call or text me. And the days when he doesnt, i get so disappointed. I finally just deleted his number out of my phone, becauses hes making me miserable!! I feel like im supposed to be with him for some reason. He knows how much i like him but i dont think he understands, that everytime we have sex, he takes a little piece of me with him. Especially since i was a virgin when i met him. So, im super confused....Am i booty call? Should i get away from him?

Sorry young ladies, I'm just trying to get some answers from people more of my age.  I'm 33.      I'm not talking about being a sasquatch / hair ball / caveman.  I'm talking about just "some" chest / stomach hair.      I KNOW it doesn't matter to my lady, but still, in general, I want to look better for her because I merely want to.      I have a mediocre muscular figure, very broad shoulders,  I'm not cut like a boxer or anything, and I don't want chest / stomach hair to be a turn off for her whether she says it or not...        I just think it would be kind of weird to shave it all off, but if the majority of women like 100% clean shaven chest / stomach, then I guess I'll try and see if she likes it.

A couple of years back this i dated this girl called Renee. B4 that i used to always play out with my friends and then when me and her started dating i used to spend alot of time with her. My friends kept on accusing me of ditching them for her and i cant lie i did once or twice. But it wasnt all the time it was like if i had plans to go like cinema with her theyd ask and say were going cinema are you coming? And id say nah man im sorry i got plans with Renee. Theyd get all angry about it and say so your ditching us They kept guilt tripping me saying ahh dont hang out with us anymore and i was young and naive. So i dumped the girl all because of them.       Now when i look back i really think that was a dumb move because i really liked her and allowed my idiot friends to get between me and her.      What do you think?

I don't know if I should tell my parents, it might cause some problems, and they might watch us even closer then, in worry we'll have sex or something ..         Is this wrong? Should I stop, or should I continue and tell someone?   I think I've grown too fond of him.         Oppinion please!
20090227062721AAxBd4h	Family & Relationships;Family	Is it a strange relationship?10 points!!!!!!!!!!?	I've got a teacher where I study with whom I've always had a very good relationship.I've known her for 6 years,and we use to talk a lot.   The thing is that after a lot of personal problems I had,I've realised that she's controlling me more than she used to do,asking other teachers if I improve or not,watching me,etc...The other day I had an exam near her house and she offered me to sleep there with her..or everytime I said something about my ex she puts a long face...   I've always thought that she could have developed a maternal instinct,since she has no children and she's not married either.But I'm not a child(I'm 24) so I don't know what her feelings are(and she's not an affectionate person) But I'm sure that she hasn't sexual feelings towards me.   This is my last year in that centre however she told me we would still be in contact...or that she could give me particular classes so that I pass the exam I want to do next year
20090227073132AAML2Q7	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	My friends wife calls him ugly a lot?	and that the only reason she married him was because she got pregnant by him two months after they met. what makes it worse is that he thinks "she really loves him" but I don't think any woman who says that during fights and even when they aren't fighting can possibly be in love. Do you think she's really telling the truth?

20090227064800AALTe6U	Family & Relationships;Friends	Please give me some advice to help a friend!?	Hello and thanks for helping me!      My best friend, which I know since we were 6 years old and I am 20 now is in a horrible emotional situation. She broke up with her boyfriend 3 months ago, they started talking again, he mentioned getting back together but they haven't. Sometimes he says nice things to her, then he treats her any of her friends. She will see him tonight and she want to make things clear! Sometimes it seems as if he loves her, and then with anger because she made mistakes and made him feel bad.      What can she tell him? She still loves him by the way!
20090305085404AAhXGTN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	MY girlfriend got kissed by another dude...what do i do?	She was up at a hockey tourney with some people. Everyone was drunk but her and she went to go to bed. She woke back up at like 6 am and some dude she knew just came and layed down beside her and turn around and kissed her on the side of the mouth. She was half asleep soshe just turned over the other way and mumbled something like "no". She let it fly cuz he was drunk. But loater that day me and her got in a big fight over the phone and considered a break. She started to cry her eyes out and began shaking anad heaving cuz we do love each other. We lost our virginity to each other. She was in the bathroom crying and the dude was leaving and came in and held her while she explained how much she wanted to be with me and how she lost her VIRGINITY to me and said we might be on a break. It calmed her down a little to think of me. But while she was thinking the dude propped her head up and said "everything is gonna be allright" and kissed her for like 2-3 seconds and tried to put his tongue in her mouth. She said she puckered by complete reaction and didnt know what was happening. and when she realized what was she put her hands out and backed away from him. She said the taste of cigerettes woke her up because she was shocked the whole time.He wasnt drunk at this point and she was never drunk at all.She said she didn't expect him to do that and said she was completely innocent and taken advantage of. She then remembered what the dude did when he was drunk and realized what he was trying to do all along. After he left, she texted him right away saying "that was a mistake and i never wanna do that again." Now she doesnt trust other boys at all and wont even hug them. Did she cheat? Can be so sad make you oblivious to whats happening? I do love her more then anything and she loves me the same. I just cant take a back a cheater. I would kick his @$$ but he lives like 3 hours away and have know idea where he lives and hes is the kind of kid who apparently would file assault charges..(cool huh).Is her story legit. (BTW i know so many details because i asked a hundred times so i could determine what exactly happen not cuz of her saying all of this.) please help. I think she is innocent!

20090227071444AAHUA94	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I stay with her?	My wife and I have been married 8 years. We have had a lot of family stress, (deaths and illness) of family members over the last 4. We had a daughter 20 months ago who we both dearly love. However, since the baby was born she has shown less and less affection for me. I turned to looking at images online to satisfy my desires, she caught it and the realtionship and sex even diminished further. She started finding fault in nearly everything I did, and became very hard to please. I have taken her on vacations, cruises, ect, but she never really seemed truly happy lately. She is a very attractive woman, and I am no slouch myself. We make a very nice couple. However, I found out she had been having a flirty relationship with a coworker who she told me she had kissed. This devastated my trust, but we agreed to try a little bit more for the sake of our family. However, I feel like if she decides this does not work out that she has another guy waiting in the wings. I had never doubted her trust in 8 years prior to that, and I beleive it would not of happened if we were happy...I just dont know how to approach this as she travels locally during the day and although she says she has no contact, how do I trust that once I have been lied to initially? I have never cheated, so i also feel like a dummy for being so gullible. There just hasn't been that commitment from her to make it work...its has been more like, lets see how things go. I don't want to push, but my pride is taking a hit here...any thoughts?

20090305101142AACh1WT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do people expect others to feel sorry for them when they were living beyond their means, had a job but jus?	you know, I graduated college in May 2008, and the whole time I was in college I just kept thinking "geez, I just want to get out of here and get a job already!" to the point where I literally had my things packed and was going to drop out. I was on a small campus and had to stay there almost 24/7 because I can't drive (the state of Maryland mandates driving school which costs $325, for everyone regardless of age) my parents could not help me, so I was at a school I hated only because it was the cheapest one available, and I relied completely on financial aid (truth be told I just hated the fact that it was historically black, because the area where I grew up was primerally black and I wanted to go somewhere that was ethnically diverse for a change). I did not even have bus money, so the only way I could leave campus was if my father drove there to get me. I would even almost be all alone on weekends because everyone else left campus. But through it all I just kept telling myself to "just stick it out till you graduate; THEN you'll be able get a job."       Now all of that time when I was in college "just sticking it out", being unable to have job and not spending any money (I did not even buy books, I just got whatever used or outdated ones I could from the library) while I watched others spend money, I assume all during this time the economy was stable and it would have been easy to get a job if I had graduated college and was looking for a job then (like in 2007, 2006 e.t.c.), yet when I wonder why I can't find a job now, people just blame it on the economy, and I can't even get UNEMPLOYMENT because I have never been able to get a job. So when I hear people who have had steady, good paying work their entire lives complain about now being out of work, I really just have to wonder how they can complain when they have everything else going for them: a job, a family, unemployment money, a decent place to live, decent food...you know where I am living at 23? In a crappy trailer with my dad and 24 year old autistic brother. My dad gets exactly $821 from a "retirement" check, but our rent is $583, his medicine is $35 and we also have other bills. I can't even look for work because I can't drive and my dad only wants to go where he wants/needs to go, when he "feels like it." And I can't tell you how many people I have had tell me how good I look and can't believe I do not have a bf, but I have SAD and major trust issues from people stalking/trying to take advantage of me, so whenever I even do happen to see a guy when I am out I either lose my nerve or he is already with a girl. I want to have a bf and I want to have kids and I want to have my own family just like all of these people do. Even if they do not have a job, at least they have that, and probably do at least have SOME money and if they want to drive they probably can. I don't have any of it!   Also, my whole life any money I have had I have LITERALLY saved it, and I can only imagine how much money I would have right now if I was ever able to get a job, because I KNOW I would save money. I do not buy things like all of these other people out here who waste money and live beyond their means. I buy only what I need and perhaps something I want if I have any money (but I never do) and will not even shop at a thrift store if I do not need it. I have even been wearing the same clothes for years. I just need a job!   I was watching a episode of Oprah where a woman had a 7 BEDDROM HOME! and food that she just threw out, and I cried as I yearned for the food she was disposing of. I simultaneously went to the fridge in our crappy trailer, which was completely empty except for an inch of milk in a jug, a sports bottle of water, and a pot of beans which my dad had borrowed $1 and purchased the beans for $1. I just literally DO NOT KNOW how people can do all of these things and expect anyone to feel sorry for them. I have had to live this way my whole life and not felt sorry for myself or said anything. So why doesn't sorry for ME for a change? And why doesn't some guy who is actually nice without bad intentions approach me?

20090305095532AAWk6O2	Family & Relationships;Family	How do I sue my father and my step-mother?	I'm 21 years old and have been living on my own since I was 17.  My parents were very abusive to me and were very unfair to me and my older brother and when I finally called them out on it they kicked me out of the house.  They do not believe in working hard...they have actually stolen over $2000 from my older brother, but he didn't press any charges.  Thankfully for me I had a job and was able to support myself.  Anyway, here's whats going on...   I have my own plan for my cell phone...not any kind of family plan or anything.  Every month I pay my bill and it's pretty much always the same.  Last month, however, my bill was completely messed up and MUCH higher, then I noticed there were 2 lines on my plan!  It turns out that Verizon Wireless allowed my father and his wife to USE my credit card number and social security number to let them have 2 lines on my plan and I would be paying all of it!  I was COMPLETELY outraged and called them and all my step-mom said was "Honey, you need to start give to your elders more" and hung up on me.  I would hate to sue them and put them in jail, but I think that would be the right thing to do, because they have done NOTHING good for me.     How do I go about getting a lawyer and doing this?   Please help!      PS - don't give me the talk about how it's family and I shouldn't do it...I don't consider trailer trash-stealing-mindless-pigs family.
