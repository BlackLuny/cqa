However why go an demonize something when they poke fun at something like this? Seriously, didn't they later do a skit on how Clinton came off as he didn't support Obama later in the show?
20081003115747AAanYyQ	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Is this classed as benefit fraud?	a woman at my sons school claims housing and council tax benefit on a 3 bed house. they were given this house by the council as they have 4 children, as 1 is autistic they got a medical letter to say he cant share a room with the other children due to his violence, hence why they got moved to a 3 bed house. however, they still have all 4 children (of mixed sexes) in 1 bedroom and use the other room as a computer room. is this benefit fraud as they arent using the house as the council intended it to be used?

McCain needs to tell the folks the truth about Obama, 'cause the mainstream media has hidden the real Obama from the folks!   What say you America?   Please opine if your so inclined, and keep it pithy!
20081010211941AAFEy6l	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Was Obama lying??? read the whole story............?	by clicking the link      Obama’s State Senate Campaign       In 1996, when Obama announced his candidacy for the Illinois Senate, guess who hosted a candidate’s party at his residence -- Ayers, who donated $200 to the Obama campaign. During Obama’s first political campaign, Anton “Tony” Rezko, a Chicago political player, originally from Lebanon, was his main finance person. Rezko, who with his wife, assisted the Obamas in the purchase of their Hyde Park home, recently was convicted in federal court of bribery and money laundering.       During the 2008 Democratic presidential primaries, Obama replied to a query about his relationship with Ayers by claiming that he knew him but only slightly as a man in the neighborhood whose children attended the same school as the Obama children. Now Ayers and Bernandine have two sons, Malik, named for Malcolm X, and Sayd, named for a Black Panther killed in a shootout with New Jersey police. Both are in their late 20s or early 30s. Obama’s children, however, are 9 and 6 and not likely to be attending school with the Ayers children. This incident is an example of Obama’s evasiveness regarding his relationship with Ayers.       Conclusion       If elected president, the real Barack Obama will shed his chameleon facade. With the cult-like support of a Democrat Congress, a Democratic news media, a Democratic academia, and a Democratic cadre of billionaire globalists, Obama will set out to “change” the United States into a socialist environment, and we will all be socialists then.          http://newsmax.com/insidecover/obama_aye...

A rumour has got back to me about an unmarked police car, which is a gold BMW 5 series probably an M5, operating between Gloucestershire and Worcestershire, possibly on the M5 motorway.      Apparently what they're doing is coming up close behind sports cars, and if they react by putting their foot down, they then put the blue light on and pull them over for speeding.      Would they do this?  If so is this entrapment?        In all fairness, if I have someone driving to close, I slow down, and will slow down to a painfully slow pace to make a point, and usually that works.

He just went back a couple of weeks ago. He has been in for 9 months. They said that when he came back they are going to transfer him to an Army base in VA.

I thought once you were in 180 days you were considered actual army.  Is he lying to her or what?

I have a boyfriend who is currently in the Army and we plan to get married in a year to a year in a half. Although, i have not seen him since Halloween because, he's been in Georgia. So im nevus to see him again. Not so much now as i am when/if he goes to war because the military changes people.   When he comes back from where ever, whether it be at war or not, and he is different, with being more stressed, more irritable, more cocky, more anxious, and whatever else might happen, what can i do to help him cope with being back in the civilian life?    I  guess what im asking is can you think of anything that that someone said or did or acted like that helped you cope with the changes or maybe something you wanted people to do or not do or something you wished someone would have? Is there ANYTHING i can do to help or canNOT do that might help?   Im trying to look up information on this topic but am not finding much, so i figured it would help more to hear it from a soldier themselves! Or maybe even if you know of a cite i could go to or someone to talk to for help with this!   Please think about it and give some input! This means A LOT to mean! HE means a lot to me!

20090309220440AAyf9JR	Politics & Government;Military	Why does the Army deploy to Iraq for 12 to 18 monthes and the Marines deploy for 6 to 10 monthes?	Why does the army stay longers??? My cousin is in the marines and he is on his 3rd tour in Iraq... I think they stay longer because the marines do all the fighting and the army is just on stand by just in case... Marines are a much better fighting force then the army.      Read a few of these:      The Marine Corps has just been called by the New York Times, 'The elite of this country.' I think it is the elite of the world.         Admiral William Halsey, U.S.   Navy 2006                  Do not attack the First Marine Division. Leave the yellowlegs alone. Strike the American Army.         Orders given to Communist troops in the Korean War;      shortly afterward, the Marines were ordered      to not wear their khaki leggings.                     Marines Never Die, They just regroup in Hell.         Gen.   Fredrick Mcknight US ARMY                  The safest place in Korea was right behind a platoon of Marines.   Lord, how they could fight!      MGen. Frank E.   Lowe, USA; Korea, 26 January 1952            Marines know how to use their bayonets. Army bayonets may as well be paper-weights.         Navy Times; November 1994             Why in hell can't the Army do it if the Marines can. They are the same kind of men; why can't they be like Marines.         Gen. John J.   "Black Jack" Pershing, USA; 12 February 1918             I have just returned from visiting the Marines at the front, and there is not a finer fighting organization in the world!       General of the Armies Douglas MacArthur; Korea, 21 September 1950             We have two companies of Marines running rampant all over the northern half of this island, and three Army regiments pinned down in the southwestern corner, doing nothing.   What the hell is going on?       Gen. John W. Vessey Jr.   , USA, Chairman of the the Joint Chiefs of Staff      during the assault on Grenada, 1983             The Marines I have seen around the world have the cleanest bodies, the filthiest minds, the highest morale, and the lowest morals of any group of animals I have ever seen.   Thank God for the United States Marine Corps!       Eleanor Roosevelt, First Lady of the United States, 1945             Some people spend an entire lifetime wondering if they made a difference in the world. But, the Marines don't have that problem.         Ronald Reagan, President of the United States; 1985             Marines I see as two breeds, Rottweilers or Dobermans, because Marines come in two varieties, big and mean, or skinny and mean. They're aggressive on the attack and tenacious on defense. They've got really short hair and they always go for the throat.         RAdm. "Jay" R.   Stark, USN; 10 November 1995                   I have only two men out of my company and 20 out of some other company. We need support, but it is almost suicide to try to get it here as we are swept by machine gun fire and a constant barrage is on us. I have no one on my left and only a few on my right. I will hold.         1stLt. Clifton B.   Cates, USMC      in Belleau Wood, 19 July 1918             My only answer as to why the Marines get the toughest jobs is because the average Leatherneck is a much better fighter. He has far more guts, courage, and better officers... These boys out here have a pride in the Marine Corps and will fight to the end no matter what the cost.         2nd Lt. Richard C.   Kennard, Peleliu, World War II

20090309221942AAh45Tj	Politics & Government;Military	Owe Lots of Money To the Military! Help!?	My sister is in a heap of debt to the navy. She joined at 18 after she declined to go to college at the coaxing of our parents who saved money to send her to private college. They gave her a choice: she was not going to just hang out all day/night, must follow rules, contribute to bills, if she didn't want to go to college OR move out! Of course she wanted to do the first, but the hanging out go to be too much for my parents and they fought a lot; she wasn't keeping a job and would leave for days at a time! so they suggested for her to join the military, which she didn't want to do, but they practically forced her. She needed discipline, a steady income, and the main reason: to get her out of the house!    So she went to boot camp for 3 months, then after coming home for a month, she had to report to duty 2 weekends a month. She went back to her old irresponsible ways, and only went, at first, once, then stopped going completely! She made up excuses to her commander in the beginning, but then just avoided them all together...In the meantime, she received a $14,000 bonus during the 2 months she came home, which was for her committing so many years...Needless to say after 1 year, now, in Jan she got a HUGE bill for 20,000 from the Navy to be paid back.  We warned and warned her  that this would happen if she quit like she did!  Just 2 weeks ago, the IRS took her entire 4,000 income tax refund. We're not sure what her next step should be. Does anyone know if she could make arrangements for a minimum payment with them, b/c we're thinking the wage garnishment is next of course...   And being the irresponsible girl she is, she spent every penny of her bonus...she screwed up big time!

I was only 13 or 14 and then 1 day they caught me in a store stealing new brakes for my bike. They were only like 10 bucks but maybe the price doesn't matter. The woman who caught me took me to a room and she ask me some question and made me sign some papers and told me that I could never go back to the store. Luckily she didn't call the cops. Now Im 18 and i have to say that i actually have gone back to the store a few times since i don't think they would recognize me anymore but is there anything I can do so that they would let me enter the store legally. Would I need to go to court or can i just talk to the manager of the store?

20090309231939AAieF1E	Politics & Government;Immigration	How can someone become a legal resident in the USA?	And also, what can someone do if they are here illegal? For example, I came here with tourist visa but decided to stay. I've been here for 6 to 7 years, I haven't caused any harm or intend to do so. I came here because it simply is a better life, and I believe and I want the American Dream, as well as several other millions of people. I know I've broken the law, and for those who really enforce it, and thats great, but besides leaving the USA and starting all over, what can I do? With Mexico being like this, I for sure don't want to go back. I love the USA. I really feel like this is my safe home and I love how the society is here. Simply the best. As you see, I did my best to be a resident (even though I don't have the papers) I attended English school and now speak it and can write it, as well as understand it. I just would like to know, how can I become a resident. Also, a bonus if you can answer this it would be great. Has President Barack Obama, explained any sort of plan for people like me? I've read it but I don't completely understand it, I would do anything to become a resident, and he mentions that we would have to have the money to pay the fin as it says in the following:"#   Bring people out of the shadows:      Obama and Biden support a system that requires undocumented immigrants who are in good standing to pay a fine, learn English, and go to the back of the line for the opportunity to become citizens.   "   Thanks to everyone who answers this correctly and honestly =]

20090309230824AA5Z1Uv	Politics & Government;Government	When will Obama supporters stop using the excuse "he just got elected?"?	I've never heard an Obama supporter support their case with facts, just excuses.  Case in point, Charles Barkley came to his defense while in jail for drunk driving over 2x the legal limit (which for a guy his size he had to have drank a gallon of Jack Daniels to be that high over) by calling Rush Limbaugh and anybody against Obama "jackasses" but didn't say why just that he has only been president for a couple months.  Supposedly he is good friends with Obama and I can see why as they are both famous for doing nothing that has actually benefited this country. So I was wondering when people will stop using his limited time in the White House or the race card as an excuse and start to actually hold him accountable for his actions.  Does anybody have any proof why his policies will work or when they will start to work?  Because so far I don't see that big of a change between him and Bush except for the fact that now the government owns more banks.

20090309232117AADpoUR	Politics & Government;Immigration	How can I change the information given in my initial US visa application?	When I applied for a US tourist Visa (and eventually got it - for 10 years) I said that I was coming for a month only, but since than my plans had changed and I've been here for 4 moths already - for traveling only. Next month I plan on going to Peru and after wards back home, because my I-94 expires on April 11th.   Now the family that wrote me the invitation and were listed as the people whom I was staying with while in the US tried to invite another friend of theirs, who was refused a visa, because of me. Apparently, at the embassy, they asked her if she knew me, and she denied because everybody completely forgot that initially I was listed as staying with them.   Now, my question is, can I call somewhere or write some letter anywhere, explaining that I only staid with them for a week or two and that now I am traveling??? Because I would hate it if they could not invite none of their relatives because of me :(((   HELP!!!! I've spent all day in the web looking for this information, but could not find anything :((((   Thank you in advance, all your answers are very help full
