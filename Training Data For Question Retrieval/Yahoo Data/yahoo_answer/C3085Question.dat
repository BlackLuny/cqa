20090309182250AAhsKcN	Local Businesses;United States;Detroit	Detroit.......................…	Well, I am a teen, and I have been wondering what it is like to live in Detroit. I am deeply in love with history and preservation. I know that Detroit has a lot of urban decay, but is most of Detroit you know, "urban decay"? I love big cities. I have been looking online, and downtown Detroit looks so beautiful in the night. I like to party, sort of. Not like party, but I like to get out and do things. I would love to move to Detroit, the problem is...What is Detroit really like? I currently live in Flint. I like the city life, so what is it like? Very confused. What parts of Detroit would you call good? What parts would you call bad? Need help!

An ex-employer told me they would keep maintenance on my vehicle due to my out side sales position. I put in a request for tires and was told too purchase the tires and I would be reimbursed up to $650.00. Due to the Economy I could not afford this expense and continued to explain my situation. Approx 6 weeks later the company shut down my dept. and I was laid off.       Here’s my problem, I purchased a laptop with my credit card and was reimbursed by the co when I started with the co. The day I was let go I did not have the lap top with me so they requested I drop it by. I then requested they pay me for my tires and they said they would get back to me.       Is it right for me to hold the lap top for until Im paid?
