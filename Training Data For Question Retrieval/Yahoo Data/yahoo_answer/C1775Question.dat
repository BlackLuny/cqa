20090226143701AA4mR4n	News & Events;Current Events	Why is it mostly right wingers who cling to their guns?	I mean, not to generalize all republicans but generally the same people who cling to their guns, are pro-life and anti gay marriage, and these views just seem very, very conflicting.      How can you be pro-life, but support the right for anyone to be allowed to carry or own assault weapons that are designed for the very purpose of killing people, especially when statistics show they stop very, very few crimes, and easy access is responsible for many.       And how can you support taking away the civil right of marriage from gays, which doesn't effect anyone who isn't gay themselves, but not support taking away the right to own an assault weapon which risks everyone. I wouldn't like sending my kid to school in America knowing any single one of those kids could come from a home where the parents own guns they don't keep properly locked away.       It just seems very conflicting, so if you're against the ban on assault weapons, and hold these views as well, would anyone care to explain why?

Her parents, who assumed their daughter had a tumour, took her to a hospital, where she was determined to be seven months pregnant. Although Medina's father was arrested on suspicion of rape, he was later released due to lack of evidence, and the identity of who impregnated Medina was never uncovered.

20090226150032AASg5lG	News & Events;Media & Journalism	Do you think that the trials of the single father are often overlooked in the media?	Sometimes I think that the commonness of women raising children without a husband has often been seen as negative when not all cases necessarily turn out with wayward kids rebelling against a stressed overbearing or permissive mother. It has also led to single fathers being totally ignored it seems by the media. I personally would like to see CNN do a study on what that is like in America because all they seem to focus on is divorce and single families headed by moms. I think if a father loses his spouse or close friend (mother of their child) via death or abandonment then there is deep grief there that almost gets no air time in the media. It seems like the focus is either on husbands trying to run their families in suburbia while working stressful jobs and avoiding foreclosure on their house or it focuses on just the father not being present in the life of everyone in the biological family like in inner city areas or the high divorce rates. Almost no attention is given to the single fathers out there who are trying just as hard as the single moms are there and I think those stories need to be told. I am sure that it is just as painful for a husband to lose his wife in death (childbirth, accident, murder, illness, etc) and raise their baby alone as much as it hurts moms to have to raise their babies alone because the father is gone (abandonment, death, divorce, etc). Both genders are feeling the same pain and I think that needs to be addressed. I think I might write a novel about that: a single father carrying on after his wife dies while giving birth to their child. These are just thoughts I had, deep thoughts, on a matter that touches me. I'm 23, single, no kids.
