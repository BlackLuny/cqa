20090304172241AA0hbIU	Social Science;Psychology	How do you deal with a death?	My grandmother (we call her Memere) has prostate cancer. She had been getting treatments and everything was going just fine, until she began to not eat. We had her at the hospital since Friday, and the doctors said she would be better in no time.      This was a lie. She is not better. The cancer spread into her kidneys. She only has, I'm guessing, a few months or not even that to live. I can't stop crying even though it will be maybe a few more weeks or so until she goes. I can't even eat anything. When she dies, you never know. Possible suicide, but I doubt it. I don't know what to do when she does die. Please, give me some suggestions to help ease the pain.      P.S. I don't know if this helps, but I'm 13.

It seem like if you don't Look or act "manly" (you know, the muscles, the height, superior aura etc) then you don't get taken too seriously by the opposite sex.

20090304190550AAfufnY	Social Science;Psychology	How do you keep silence when you are angry?	I have seen many people who keep silence when they are very angry. What do they think while keeping silence? Are they not tempted to shout back or hit back?       I really want to learn this ettiquite of keeping silence while I am angry. I feel this is the ultimate sophistication a person can adopt.       Please suggest me tips how to balance behaviour while I am angry      Personal note: I usually shout/yell at the top of my voice when I am angry. I tend to speak all bad things about the person I am angry with. Not to mention, I embarass the person to the extent that it can make him lose self confidence and self esteem. I also have tendency to insult the person in front of public if I am angry with him. I know this behaviour is socially unacceptable and hence I want to change it. I want to become a sophisticated person who believes in his own reputation before spoiling others reputation. But I dont seem to understand the logic and hence need help from people who think in the manner of silence-for-anger.      Thanks to all who contribute.
20090304223052AAriBwZ	Social Science;Psychology	What would cause a baby to reject affection?	This past week, I've been trying to dig deep and figure out why I'm not an affectionate person. I'm not warmly attached to people I feel obligated to connect to. I read that when children know down deep inside they are loved, they have no problems showing affection or receiving it.      As I was talking to my mom earlier tonight, I questioned her about my lack of love towards others. She said that even as a month old baby, I would cry if she held me. Only when she set me down, I would suddenly stop. That amazed me. I mean, not just to sleep, but in general. I didn't want to be held, I'd rather lay down by myself.      I kept asking more questions, and she proceeded to say that I preferred to hold my own bottle. I didn't like when she held it. It wasn't specified whether I fed myself, but I'm going to assume not. I just objected to her holding my bottle.       Can a baby really be born with Social Anxiety Disorder? (I have it currently.) What was wrong with me? I've never actually read anything about a BABY rejecting others' attention.       Before I've even read human touch is vital for the young. That if a baby feels neglected long enough they could in fact actually die.

I asked this in the "Singles and Relationships" section, but got no answers, so I'm hoping that here will be better. :)      I feel weird having such vivid dreams. I had one the other night where I kissed one of my close male friends. In reality, he's just a friend I talk to, never really had a thing for him. Lately every time I see him, I have the random urge to kiss or hug him (which I don't, of course).       Strangely as odd as that sounds, I don't want to be his girlfriend and I don't have a 'crush' on him.      Is this abnormal? Does this mean something? Thanks in advance.

Ok, I've been dreaming about spiders for the last 2months on a regular bases, 5 to 6 nights out of a week. Sometimes up to 3 times a night. And its always a different kind of spider each time. One dream that stands out is the one I had about two spiders, both big, one black and hairy, the other a creamy colour with no hair. They were coming towards me when they noticed each other. And then the black one attacked the creamy one and killed it, and i was feeling sorry for the creamy one... I usually dream of them just sitting watching me or coming towards me. Last night I dreamt about baby spiders, crawling all over me, and the more I flicked them off of me, the more they crawled over me? Please, if anyone can help me understand why I keep on dreaming about them, I would be great full.

I saw him in the crowded area and was debating whether to go over and see him. Then, he got in a car and drove into dark blackness/dissapeared.      ...any ideas?   is my love life doomed..?

20090304225033AAcWHur	Social Science;Psychology	When you were young did you ever feel you couldn't grow up?	I am only a teenager and am always thinking that I could never be grown up and live on my own. I want to have kids because I am a very motherly type but I never can imagine getting married and having children. I am a very shy girl and can't imagine myself with a guy forever. It is so weird. I am just wondering if I am the only one.
20090304235814AAspRaL	Social Science;Psychology	Am I too nice of a person?	Ever since I was a little kid, I've been a nice person. I never say anything bad to people and would never get in a fight with someone unless they provoked me. I would rather walk away from people that are trying to cause trouble. I would always try to help people in anyway I can and I feel bad seeing other people being taken advantage of. I'm still the same way but I feel like I need to change and be a little crazier because I think people find me too boring and pathetic. It's like they don't believe what they're seeing in me. I'm like the most innocent guy you will ever meet. You will never hear me yell or scream a bad word and being mean to anyone.      Now, I'm 20 and starting to reflect on myself more. I feel like I need to be meaner and tougher because it feels like people think I'm weak being too nice and I'm sad to realize that I've no close friends even though I'm a nice person. Why can't a nice person like me have some good friends? :(

20070406201303AAhUAA7	Social Science;Other - Social Science	A question about memories..?	Last summer I spent a year at the beach. It was my favorite summer yet, and I hung out with friends and i simply love it at the beach. But now- only 3 months away from a year later- I miss it so much. I even cry about it, at least once a week, because I miss it so terribly. It's my favorite place in the world. Is this strange?
20090304225605AAfrjSv	Social Science;Psychology	I think I see this spirit (or figure) sometimes... is this normal?	Okay, I'm sorry if this is worded badly, but it's kind of hard for me to explain. Also, I'm sorry if I type too much.      At night, I feel like someone is always watching me... like there is another presence in the room. I'm too scared to get up and use the bathroom, for example, because I'm I get this feeling that I'm always being followed. If I absolutely HAVE to use the bathroom, I will walk very quickly to it, and my heart will be racing a little. Or, I have to turn on the hallway light AND my room light, and keep it on until I'm done. I've had this feeling ever since I was little.      Just recently however, I think I've been seeing these spirits or figures (I don't know what else to call them). They blend into the darkness, and I can see a very faint line that sort of traces the outside of it's body... and I can see it's eyes glaring at me. Think of like a ninja, or a robber, with an all black suit and a ski mask covering all of it's head and face except for the eyes, except I don't think the body it quite human.   Sorry... like I said, it's kind of hard to explain!      Anyway, at times I can see this figure lurking in the corners of my room, just staring at me. Or when I turn over to my right, I see it leaning against my wall. I have even seen it on my ceiling. I also hate having my shades open, because sometimes, I can see it's face pressed up against to the window, staring through it at me. The only times I DON'T see it is when I'm looking straight ahead (but when I so much as glance at a corner, I see it) or when I'm turned facing the wall on the left side of the room, but even then I can feel it behind me.      There was one night, when I swear that it was really close to me... like leaning on the (right) side of my bed and this time, it was like it was looking right into my eyes. I also could also hear a heavy breathing (that was NOT my own). I started to cry.      I haven't had any traumatic event happen to me recently or anything like that, so I have no idea what would cause it.      I saw it everyday for a couple of weeks, but now I don't see it AS much.      It has also been in my dreams as well.      (okay, this is going to sound weird/lame, but)   For like a week, I had these re-occuring dreams that I was still a Freshman in high school (I'm a junior now), and I met this guy who started talking to me and eventually asked me out. In my dream, I was a little weary at first, because I had this feeling he was going to hurt me SOMEHOW, but I said yes, anyway. For some reason, I was really attached to this guy, which is weird, because as far as I know in the dream, I didn't really know him that well, and usually (in real life), I'm not so concerned with relationships. Well, I later find out in my dream, that he asked me out as a joke to all of his friends, and that he just wanted to see how long it would take to get the quiet girl laid. Well, I finally do end up sleeping with him, and it turns out that he was video taping us the whole time. Later on in the dream, I find out that it's on some porn website. By the end of the dream, all I see is this computer screen, with the video playing of us having sex, and I see the spirit lurking there, too (it's kind of hard to explain. I didn't see it's eyes though (like I usually do), I just saw it go across the screen... It was kind of vague, though, because it was a really low quality video, so it looked kind of pixel-y, and the spirit was kind of blurry.      What does seeing this... thing mean? Is this normal- has this happened to you?

Lately I have been F'ucking up in school ( ditching to sleep in and get time off). I have gotten so behind that it is impossible to graduate when I schedule to do so. So now I feel very empty and depressed about messing up. Due to working full time and School full time I just don't feel like I have anytime to rest, relax and be me. It also doesn't help that I have BPD which is a stresser of it's own right. I really don't know what to do about my situation, I have to work to keep living on my own, and I have to keep going to school to get a career. I am just depressed and exhausted....

20090305010152AAKGyOK	Social Science;Psychology	What do you think this strange alien abduction dream means?	I had a dream i was abducted by aliens (who had secretly infiltrated the chinese government) and taken to their strange space ship, where there were several other hundred people. All we did all day was sit around and watch the tv, which made no sense because all they showed were random clips from old tv shows, many not even in english. I suspected that the tv was trying to brainwash us so I tried to avoid it.       Also, in the middle of this big hall where we were kept there was a pool of purple/lavender liquid crystal, in which there was a statue which I thought looked like Charlize Theron, and upon closer observation I realize that is was her--for real--and that the crystal was slowly absorbing her. It was really creepy because I was looking at the statue and then it moved slightly to look at me. I noticed that people avoided the pool, which was odd because it the was the only interesting thing in the place, and then realized why when when Charlize exploded, sending a shower of purple crystal liquid everywhere, some got on my shirt and then people screamed at me not to let is touch my skin because if it did then it would start to eat me and I would end up being the next 'statue' so I managed to get the shirt off, but got some on my hands and so had to hide them because I was afraid of what would happen if they realized i had been 'infected'      Also, when I was first brought in and still disoriented some random person came up to me and stuffed some folded papers in my hand, and told me I had to hide them and not let the aliens (who looked like 80's era communist chinese soldiers) to get the papers, a few minutes later the guards caught him and they started searching the other prisoners to find the papers, and strangely enought I ran into some of people I used to know from highschool up there so I gave each person one sheet and told them to hide it and not to tell me where so if one of us got caught we would't know where the other sheets were (the sheets had some sort of scientific diagrams on them which didn't make sense to me, though i think it may have been the spaceship blueprints so maye an escape route/plan??) so I spent my time trying to figure out where to hid my sheet since there wasn't many places to hide, beign a prison and all.      Totally radom eh?
20090305010201AAzfLZw	Social Science;Psychology	How can I enjoy life with no friends or family?	I'm a 19 year old guy who is about to turn 20. I just moved out on my own about 7 months ago. All my life I have had terrible living situations. I'm a total loner, no friends or family to talk to. My family shunned me out long ago and my mother not longer talks to me. I get very scared when I think of how alone I am and how there is no one to help me in the event that I might get hurt. Who could I turn to? I just feel so sick all the time and I think it has a lot to do with massive depression. Like I said, I am a loner, so I find it difficult to communicate with other people around me. Sometimes I can go a whole 2 days without speaking a word. Why do I have to live such a worthless life anyway? All I want is some to know who I am. :( What can a sick guy like me do?
20090305015121AADe7bX	Social Science;Psychology	How will I overcome this teenage problem?	I love my parents, but sometimes I hate them like the way they talk, or behave in public. I sometimes hate being with them when going out or showing care or concern to me especially when somebody's around. It even reached to a point that I hate myself so much because I discovered that their imperfections both in physical and character are also in me. I usually don't answer them in a nice way. I would shout at them when I'm being asked because I always remember that I have lots of imperfections because of them. It also made me think that it would be better if I was a son of other privileged, more good looking couple.       However, I knew that this feeling is very normal for a teenager especially in early teen life. Please help me how to get over this. I also realize that I'm a bad boy but still that 'hate' won't go away. I want to help myself to overcome this. I want to be mature but I don't know what to think or do. I need your help. Please give me a helpful answer. Thank you so much.
20090305001402AA7WHQs	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Is dream interpretation just a bunch of voodoo mojo ****?	I mean it seems interesting but when these girls are talking about how as soon as there is something red in your dream it's automatically about love. I mean that makes no sense. I like a more psychoanalytical approach. I believe that the content of dreams is just your brain rearranging thoughts but it's which ones are significant and how your brain forms those in to a story that should be analyzed.

20090305010633AALh8eH	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Can anyone tell me the meaning of my dream?	I had this dream a few weeks ago, but it's still so vivid and almost every night I have a dream similar to this one. My point of view in the dream is third person, meaning I don't actually get involved in the dream, I simply watch.      At the beginning of the dream, it shows a picture of a woman, average looking, but with a bright light surrounding her. It then shows a picture of her chest open and a golden halo of light surrounding her heart, almost exactly they way they portray Jesus in a lot of paintings. Then, the woman's birth and childhood years flash before my eyes. It shows that when she was born, the doctors found a defect with her heart, which caused it to glow quite brightly. Because of this, you could see the light even through her chest and clothes. Her family was in a cult, and they believed it to be a sign that she was blessed. So, they would take their daughter to people's houses and she would perform a ceremonial dance, at a high price, that would supposedly bless their household and all those who enter it.   Then, the dream skips forward to her adulthood. She is married, and living in the middle of a desert-type region with absolutely no one surrounding her. The house is made of tin, and resembles a large storage shed. The house is poorly furnished, and has no electricity. Elaborate paintings cover the walls, but that is it. The floor is dirt, the same dirt that surrounds their house and the entire landscape. The only thing they can see for miles are mountains and a dirt road. I never see her husband clearly, he is only a blurry shadow of a person. The woman still does her ceremonial dances, that is what she does for a living.   The dream then skips forward, and the woman is eight months pregnant. She has refused to name the child until it is of the age where it can name itself. The child is born, and it has the same defect as it's mother. The gender is unclear, but it appears to be male. The father and mother believe that this child will bring them lots of money and power, so they guard it closely.   One night, while the mother is sleeping, she dreams that if she eats the child's heart while it is still alive then she will become the most powerful person in the universe, even more powerful than her god. She wakes up immediately, and takes the child outside. She bangs it's head against the tin wall until blood has covered the child's body, and forces her hand through the chest of the child and pulls the heart out. She consumes it, and paints herself in the blood of her baby.   Then, she goes out and dances wildly in the middle of the desert-like terrain.   She stops dancing for a moment, and holds her chest, eyes wide.   She screams painfully, and falls to the ground. Her heart bursts from her chest, and a bright light explodes from it. The hear turns into a bio luminescent, extremely large, butterfly and flies off toward the sun.      That is the end of the dream.   I know it's very long and descriptive, but I would like to know the meaning!   Please help!!

I had a dream last night/this morning about me being forced to move away by my parents, but the move happened within a day, i didn't pack any of my stuff and i wasn't aloud able to tell my boyfriend ( i've been with my boyfriend for nearly a year )      I thought we were moving really far away because the car journey took ages! the rest of my family were fine and happy about, i was crying all the way there,when we got to our new house my bedroom was already set up with all my stuff, i was still crying.      But my mum and dad had taken my bag,with my phone i couldn't call my boyfriend, to say i'd moved.      I thought about a long-distance relationship, but i'd tried that before and it didn't work out also,without a phone to contact him i wasn't able to tell him where i was or anything.      Then our family were randomly in a town,were i saw a guy me and my boyfriend are friends with getting on a bus, witch i found really odd & confusing because i'd moved away. I also saw to girls who looked like identical twins, but it seemed they didn't know each other.      What could any of this mean please...?

20090305002824AATOWIT	Social Science;Psychology	How to overcome carelessness?	I am really annoyed with this carelessness thing of mine.       Recently, we had an exam in our school and one of our tasks is to solve a problem-- particularly an accounting problem. It was really just an easy problem but I was not able to have the correct answer. I didn't review my work because the time allotted is very limited. I thought I was able to get the correct answer by the time I solved the problem for the first time. It was just a very small mistake, with a slight erroneous miscalculation of one figure.      I really hate it.      I do need your advice, pls. help.

20090305015453AAlV4pl	Social Science;Gender & Women's Studies	Non Feminists, what do you think about?	this article statement about Feminist influence on society in the UK in regards to education, hetero-sexual relationships etc.      "there is growing evidence that women are outstripping men intellectually. Sociologists and education specialists are bemoaning the continuing triumph of girls over boys at every level of the education system, leading to the inevitable question of whether the male gender is reaching the end of its natural usefulness."       "If, as is often observed, women do the lion’s share of the domestic duties in most homes, the question of whether they will continue to find men necessary becomes more pressing. A number of academics think that if you remove men’s higher earning power and their unique ability to father children, more women will inevitably choose to live with other women"      "Women are increasingly admitting to a willingness to experiment in sexual relationships with other women instead of men. Last year the American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported the number of adult women having lesbian sex had almost trebled, from 4% to 11.5%, in one decade. Researchers such as John Bancroft, the British-born former director of America’s Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction, says surveys in Britain and Australia have produced similar findings to the CDC, but he argues that women’s sexuality is more fluid, and that bisexual tendencies may have little significance.

20090305005947AAk7bIf	Social Science;Psychology	I feel disgusted with myself for being Irish-American?	My dad is from Ireland and my mom's parents are from Ireland and I have lived in Ireland as a child but mainly grew up in the US. I'm 17 and have an American accent and am disgusted with myself. My whole life all I've ever wanted to be is Irish. I always took pride in the IRish flag and could care less about the American (no offense intended). I'm applying to colleges in Ireland but I know even if I was to move there I would look like a fool trying to put on an Irish accent and act Irish. I've grown up mostly in Los Angeles which I hate. If I had at least grown up in New York I could take pride in that but Los Angeles...... I want to be Irish, not American. I constantly feel bad about not being Irish. Any advice?

20090305003528AA9VGQJ	Social Science;Dream Interpretation	Dreaming of sea, running, mask, balloon?	Okay, here's one weird dream I just had:      I am at sea, walking with a former friend on a platform made of bricks, where other people are also having a walk. The sea is very calm, and the weather is sunny and enjoyable.    All along on the side of this platform, there's slightly lower part also made of the same bricks, but these parts are immersed and barely visible.      I decide to run away from that friend (like I want to in real life for various reasons), and then I'm at the limit of the platform. I turn back, she's not there anymore.      I am now in a street of my city, running, doing jogging and I am not at all tired, and I say to the people outside "C'mon people! Everybody run!" But I don't know if they obeyed.      I am feeling happy in this dream.      (Now this is going to get kind of weird, I'm warning you)   And then, I am walking around with balloons, and these represents a ridiculous man wearing a heavily decorated mask and lipstick.   I then remember I was the one who made this guy wear a mask and lipstick to take a picture of him and make balloons out of it.   I blow one, and we both find this funny and great and many people want these balloons....      I have been laughing somewhere in this dream but I cant remember when.

20090305010603AAplvrr	Social Science;Psychology	Why are people so cruel and will ruin a person's life?  And, why doesn't anyone ever try to stop this?	Teasing and ridicule are one thing, but what about ruining a person's life?  While together in groups individuals, who show behavior that differ from others, are subject for ridicule and are sometimes placed into positions in which they will take a fall.     Sometimes, this fall will prevent them from being able to live because they lost their job or failed in a class they need to graduate.  What baffles me, is that after this event, those aware of the event will find this act acceptable and do nothing to help and may even share a laugh with the one(s) committing the act.  Society doesn't find rape acceptable, because of the pain inflicted on the victim.  Yet, many seem to find it socially acceptable to ruin a person's life, so long as that person does not have any power to hurt them in retaliation and are seen as being "different".

Such as a family member who is younger than me, who I was brought up to let have their own way because they were younger, and who now, at 40 still uses the strategies that worked when she was a child. ie giving guilt trips, presenting fait accompli then being "hurt" when you don't want to do what she has prepared for you, and "happy" when you do. She also reads pop psychology magazines so has a smart answer to everything, all of which are designed to ensure she feels absolutely ok about anything she says to you, and it's your responsibility if you allow it to hurt you.

20090305025219AAk8dI1	Social Science;Psychology	How to monitor your own behavior in life?	Life review  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_review       Since all our actions can be conceived as being good or evil, yet there is no set rules philosophically that state what is defined as good or evil, some argue that good and evil does not exist; so we cannot prove for certain if we are good or evil.      However, all of our actions are the result of mental processes that occur, these processes are what we want out of them actions, the purpose of these actions; and thus the thoughts are important more than the acts them selves.      The thoughts themselves are a result of our intentions, our intention to be good or evil; thus if we could read our intentions, we could prove whether a person was really good or evil at heart.      Since we cannot know without reading each others minds, then what can be done in the afterlife is a 'life review' which does show us our intentions and not our actions.   We judge our selves, because we are our best judges, but in a way that judges our own intentions rather than actions.   Also we only know our intensions the most.      It is in those intentions, that we are shown how they have affected others emotionally and morally. So then we have a real understanding of who we are in terms of our moral nature.      Try this out as an experiment...      Think of your whole life; do not think so much about what you have done good or bad, but think of the intensions behind them actions.   The sum total of these intensions and the way that they have affected others to the best of your knowledge is the best judge of who you are. But do not forget your moral nature does change in time.      Now tell me, what do you think of yourself?   Does this change your outlook on how you should behave?      CREED

20090305025112AA9OlTu	Social Science;Psychology	Is this nasty behaviour, what is wrong with this girl?	I had a hole in my stocking, when I went to a dance class. You didn't notice much because I was wearing a long skirt, and when I was busy dancing, nobody noticed, then a friend arrived for the next class and she didn't even acknowledge my existence, or even take in my clothes, which I felt were beautiful, except to look straight down at my toes of my stocking, because they were pared at the ends, they'd sort of pared back gradually, as stockings do, and she acted as though she didn't want to talk to me. I said "hello," and was friendly, because that's not what I'm like, but she pulled away. Then when I asked my parents about it, they were nastier, and said, " no wonder, you look poor...", and my father said, "she's probably ashamed..."  I couldn't believe it. I've never been raised to behave like that. I determinedly said, "well, I'll spend a hundred dollars on the best, classy clothes I can find," because I feel I have good taste, and my father just said, "good." I couldn't believe it. These stockings just sort of popped up, in the box, and I hadn't time to buy any new ones, I have various stockings, but different ones turn up, and because it had only just got cold, recently, I suddenly needed stockings, so I wasn't that used to the stocking thing, after a long break of wearing them. My mum rubbed it in, saying "I told you so, and you ignored me," which wasn't true because I verified with her about what I was doing, but she said, "well, the dancers are gypsies, bohemians, etc, it should be okay," and the others didn't notice it. I've always been a bit of a carefree artistic person, and at theatre school people didn't really see those things as important, what was more important was what was in your mind, your artistic flair. When I got upset at my father, he just said, "well, I'm leaving when I get the pension." So just from an evening, of a hole in a stocking, I came home to what seemed like Hell.

Basically I'm finding it hard for myself and some of my friends to even get respect just because we're laid back and easy going. We dress well and are well-groomed, but whenever we go and meet other people, especially the other sex, we just seem to be just lumps in the ground to everyone else. We get pushed to one side and they don't listen when we try to gauge them with various subjects of conversation, since their attentions are often focused on whatever group of high-pitched females are in the vicinity. Is this what guys only go out to the public for? Or do we have to be more louder so they can hear us?
20090305030844AARva3h	Social Science;Psychology	Is this a good thing?	I can't get intimidated. When someone tries to intimidate me i challenge them, not necessarily to a fight but i'll intimidate them  back showing them i'm ready anytime to throw down.. Is this good or is it bad? I'm not that tall, i'm about 5"6 and weigh about 110 pounds.. I also have a very short temper so the smallest things could erupt into a fight.. And when i do fight i try to unnerve  my opponent  by taking their punches as if i'm showing them that their punches don't hurt and that i'm enjoying the fight, i laugh and smile and make faces at them.. Is this good?
20090305022920AAXL5Cx	Social Science;Psychology	Am I a sociopath or.....?	I know deep down I'm not. Then again, that's also a sympton.   I don't care much about people, I don't know why I should....   It makes me feel weird to say this: I don't love my mum, if she died I would only be sad as I wouldn't be normal like everybody else.   I'm antisocial.   Quiet.   Aggressive when provoked.   Charming, manipulative.   In primary school I would lead a group of morons who I didn't really care about. I don't really care about people.   I can love, but not for long and i'm easily put off.   I can have sex with any human being not caring about the outcome (why should I when it's a one nightstand and most likely i'll never speak to that person again?)      I've always had this mentality, even as a younger child I had it to some extent. I do care about things.    Also I have Despernalized Disorder, post traumatic stress and i'm a chronic depressed.      There was once a time when I cried for people etc.   But now, who gives a damn?      Another thing, I only cry when bad things happen to me.

20090305025301AAJh9mT	Social Science;Other - Social Science	Is it possible that homosexuality is a natural response to overpopulation?	Just a thought I had while watching "Milk".  Is it possible that homosexuality is a process of evolution?  A means to preserve our species?  If the human species keeps populating this earth, and it will, we will eventually get to the point where we cannot survive on this planet.  It is not a question of "if" so much as "when".  Maybe homosexuality is being bred into our genetic makeup to extend that deadline.  Obviously, it is not the answer since the human species will continue to reproduce exponentially; however, maybe it is an attempt by nature, or rather by our species, to extend our time on this planet.  Thoughts?
