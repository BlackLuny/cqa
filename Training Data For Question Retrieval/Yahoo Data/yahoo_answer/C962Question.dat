They don't do that for all the other teams.....      .....and that's a good thing because if there were such a penalty as "jacking" we'd see the Hurricanes boxscore saying "Brind'Amour car jacking" even "Staal car jacking".....

I've run 35-40 miles/week for several years now (pain free), and I ran 21 miles (3h05m) last weekend without any muscle pain, and I didn't hit "the wall".  However, my right heel is sore (much more so today than it was yesterday or the day before).  I'm wondering how best to handle this and what I should do in the last few weeks to prepare myself...the marathon is in Austin, which has a reputation for being "hilly".

20090202104613AAP2jxq	Sports;Football (American)	Why cant fans ever just be happy and enjoy a great game?	everyone on the losing side always goes straight to blaming the refs! they did it last year saying manning was "in the grasp" on the tyree play, and here we go again this year. if the refs throw a lot of flags its "aw man let em play" even if its a legit call like 99% of the calls last night. if they dont throw then everyone is like "what the hell man where the ref". yeah it looks bad when the penalties favor one team, but could it possible be because they COMMITED more penalties. plus everyone knows they can call holding on everyplay, and the cards definitely held Harrison a ton last night.      "questionable" calls last night   1. Roughing the passer in 3rd Qtr- i agree it was pretty weak but i have seen worse flags than that.       2. roughing the holder- legit call just like running into the kicker. didnt matter anway since they ended up being held to a FG.      3. Holding in the endzone for safety- i dont think it was a hold but i can see why they called it      4. end of game fumble- why does everyone seem to forget that EVERY play inside of two minutes is reviewed upstairs. they saw that it was a fumble so didnt bother making the ref look at it.       theres a bunch of non calls i could go on and on about but im not gonna waist any more time than i have.        Both teams played a hell of a game, one of the best i have ever seen and its sad nobody can take it for that and has to ***** about the officiating....again!

Should he be in the team?   Is this how the selection system should be?   If not him, then who should be in the team?      Thanks      All the best

Is it because he is on the OKC Thunder that he is able to put up his stat line or is it that he has bounced back from what many believed to be an NBA threatening injury that he is able to put up this stat line.      Im from Jersey and I hate the Nets. But, I remember when K-Mart, then an All-star left. The Nets wanted Nenad to be the next big thing, ie K-Mart at the time and he was well on his way putting up very good numbers and he had a decent mid range game.      He was big against my Knicks in that playoff sweep and after that the injury made him miss an entire season and a half of his career. When he came back was not as good and last off season signed to play in Europe. Until, a couple of moths ago he was signed by Thunder and has bounced back why?

IF that were the case (again I'm not here to argue whether or not that's what happened) and the refs saw it would that be a touchdown? I just thought if one foot was on the ground and the other was touching it but not touching the ground, that isn't a touchdown. But maybe I'm misunderstanding the rule.

Dwight Howard-We're talking about the best C,rebounder and blocker in the nba now and the best dunker in the nba with James,but i think James is better.   Al Jeferson-Great centre with great inside scoring skills.   Yao Ming.

20090202153112AAqFTqL	Sports;Tennis	Where does the idea that Novak Djokovic is nipping at the heels of the Big Two come from?	i mean, what has this guy given us to make us think that? he beat a sick Federer over a year ago, since then what? He got whipped by Marat very early in Wimbledon, despite the fact Marat didnt even believe he could win (Safin had booked his own plane flight home before the match even started) then beat comprehensively by Federer at the US Open, on his favourite hard court surface. Federer and Nadal are the two best players in the world at the moment and there is nothing to indicate that Novak (or Murray, for that fact) is even close. Novak pulled out at the US Open, meaning at such a young age he already is just one slam away from the "retirement grand slam", already having pulled out of three different grand slam events. He won Aussie Open 2008 but has not been close to looking like a serious threat ever since. Look at his retirements, its whenever hes losing. He simply is not mentally tough enough to have any kind of sustained success in this business. He is a sore loser that would rather retire and use that as an excuse. Even at the US Open he was talking up his injuries before the Roddick match, obviously so that he would have something to fall back on should he lose. As for Murray, I watched him in the Aussie Open and even in the matches he won he looked very mediocre and basically like a big clumsy man. I don't care if he's on a three game winning streak vs Roger, do it in the Grand Slam or no-one cares. Look how Fed played throughout the two weeks he was in great form apart from the final set of the final match. He plays better in Grand Slam events, he has won 13 of them. That is 13 times the amount of Novak and Murray combined. This question is mainly at Djokovic cause I think Murray will eclipse Djoker soon I honestly think Novak has peaked and is done in terms of winning grand slam events. I see nothing that would indicate that either Rafa or Roger would drop out of the top two anytime soon.      Novak's BEST result in the last three grand slam events is the semi finals   Federer's WORST result in the last three grand slam events is losing the grand final in the deciding set   Nadal's WORST result in the last three grand slam events is the semi finals

Take a good look at the replay wherever you've been viewing them from the conclusion of the game to now. When Fitzgerald brings the ball in, he sort of twists it away from the defender. The nose of the ball clearly (at least to me) definitely nicked, if not touched, the ground. There was no question he caught & maintained control of the ball, but even with this in mind, if it even so much as grazes the grass/turf, it's incomplete. Did anyone but me notice this?

But Florida wins the championship. Now I'm all about SEC, don't get me wrong, but I'm more about true champions instead of mediocre rewards. Here's the question that I'd like everyone's opinion on. People that support the bowls say it's good for both the schools and the cities that they're held in, people that support the playoffs... well, basically just support a true champion. Instead of voting to do one or the other, why not combine the two. Here's the catch: Create a normal 16 team playoff system. Let the sponsors of the different bowls bid on their position throughout the playoff tree. So for example, the BCS bowls could bid for the national Championship, with the others taking the Semi-finals. Then all the other bowls could bid for the other playoff games. So each playoff game would still in fact be a bowl game... Thoughts? Opinions? Lay it on me....

Can anyone suggest a reason why Nigel De Jong and Yohan Cabaye are disliked? (is there something wrong with their personality?)

Now it sounds a little crazy to say that signing a contact player with good power is a problem, but think about it.  Our three best power hitters are now left handed (Utley, Howard, Ibanez).  When we had Burrell, we could balance our lineup out with a powerful right hander but now we don't have the luxury.  However, Jayson Werth proved last year that he has a powerful bat.  But is he good enough to replace what Burrell could do offensively as a right handed hitter?      Here is what I think their lineup should look like.

20090202160551AAUjcd0	Sports;Football (American)	Is anyone else upset by this...?	 http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/blog/ball_do...       I saw this during the game and wondered why it wasn't brought to more attention.  As I actually have no life and watch TV I knew exactly what was going on, too bad no one else did.  The one time a 15 yard penalty on the kick off probably would have had a significant impact on the game, and "they" blow it.  I don't want to take anything away from the steelers win, but this kind of malarkey BS has happened all year and if I were a coach or a player I would "want some butts and I would want em now!" to quote an old 80's movie.  I know it guarantee's nothing, but realistically the cards could easily have the ball on their own 40 with 30+ sec left instead of their own 20, and with Warner  and 2 timeouts that's a much more plausible scenario.  Then again they could botch the kick and end up on their own 10.  Either way it should have been called...blockheads!

20090202171814AAUB7Z0	Sports;Football (American)	Should the Super Bowl be INVALID?	The refs made some BAD calls that cost the Cardinals. Warner's hand was moving forward, at the very least he should get his Hail Mary pass. Harrison was down at the 1 not in the end zone. Holmes didn't get his right toe down. That's just off the top of my head!      I want a protest filed with the league. We need a full investigation. At worst they should re-convene the game and give Warner his toss. At best the Super Bowl needs to be invalidated and played over. Unless its found that these refs were paid off or were Steeler fans. In that case they should just disqualify the Steelers and give the Lombardi trophy to the team that deserves it: the Cardinals.      I'd like to hear what you folks think of my ideas which I think embody FAIRNESS.

20090202180029AAWWkQc	Sports;Football (American)	Why Santonio and not James Harrison for the MVP?	I think Harrison was the Steelers hero, if he didn't do the improbable interception return the Cards at least would have tied the game.      That play meant 10 or 14 point difference for Pittsburgh, because it stopped the Cards from scoring and let the Steelers take a 10 point lead.      I hate that in the last 5 Super Bowls (since the last one won by the Pats) the winning defense shined brighter than the Offense and an Offensive player got the MVP.

20090202195221AAR7GxS	Sports;Baseball	Best Hitter, Pitcher, Player of All-Time?	Something needs to bridge the gap to spring training. Who, in your opinion, is the best      Hitter    Pitcher   Player      in baseball history. I'm gonna have to go with      Ted Williams - Ever see him hit? If you have, you won't disagree.      Satchel Paige - Racism took a toll on everybody, including the legacies of ***** league players. This guy could do whatever he wanted with the ball. The classic story goes that he would tell his fielders to come in for the end of the inning with only 2 outs, and then Proceed to strike the next guy out on three fastballs. I would have loved to see him and Teddy Ballgame go at it.      Babe Ruth - I don't think people will like this. But think about what Ruth did as a hitter. Then add 3-4 full seasons as a young man to that. Probably 800 home runs. But that's not what makes him so great. If he wasn't such a great hitter, and if that talent wasn't recognized by managers and coaches, Cliff Lee would have just won the AL Babe Ruth award, not the AL Cy Young. The man was born to play baseball. He was arguably the best hitter AND the best pitcher in baseball history. Nobody else can comes any close.         sorry about the lack of love for Say Hey, he is most certainly the best overall position player the game has ever seen, but Ruth's talent on the rubber completely dwarfs him in my opinion.

20090202105806AAqb3UB	Sports;Football (American)	A lot of hype around about the Cardinals, did you catch the refbowl?	The Cardinals had the potential and skill level to beat the Steelers, which was obvious earlier in the postseason by beating them.    This superbowl was the first one the Arizona Cardinals have ever attended to, and lost mainly because of the refs. Now i'm not saying it was all the refs fault, because they did need to pick up their intensity level and work more as a team, but the refs helped 0%.    The Steelers had all the benefit of the doubt with the refs, and the Cardinals got Technical fouls here and there. There was roughing the passer, roughing the kick holder, and dumb stuff like that when the players were uncontrollable to stop.    Also, when Kurt began to throw that last pass, it is clear as day, his arm was going into a forward motion, to throw the ball off, and not get sacked, but the refs called it a fumble! And with 5 seconds left! They could have had the Booth review the play, just incase because that one play could have decided the game. Instead they reviewed the same circumstance that happened earlier in the game, which didn't help the Cardinals out much.    [ May not seem like much, but 5 seconds is definitely more thn enough to win a game in the superbowl ]    James Harrison's interception run back, the ball and knee were down on the ground on the one yard line. Only thing was, Fitzgerald's leg was between the ball and ground, so they called it a touchdown instead. Does that mean if a player lays down right on the touchdown line, and lays the ball on another players back that is laying on the 1 yard line, it is still a touchdown? I got confused with that play.    Also, James Harrison [ same guy ] in the fourth quarter held a Cardinals player down, punched hi in the back, waited for him to stand up, shoved him down, pounced over to where he fell, waited until he got back up again,and threw him down for the second time, and this was all away from the ball! But all he got was a techniqal foul! Same thing as accidently running into the QB lightly, after he threw the ball!    Now, on Santonio Holmes. That last catch, yes was a catch. A very nice one at that, except at the end of the touchdown, why did he have to showboat? He sat on the ground for 5 minutes, and hugged the ball like it was his baby or something, and only to rub it in the Cardinals face.  Poor sportsmanship here? Or am i missing something?    With all these different things that happened throughout the game, the Cardinals deff. could have been closer, or even had won the Superbowl.     Instead we got stuck with a refbowl.  What are your opinions on the game? Who did you want to win and why?  I believe the Cardinals had deserved to play in and win the superbowl way more than the Steelers did. After such a bad season last year, and nearly pulling off a "Boston Celtics". The Arizona Cardinals should have won superbowl 43.

20090202194252AAWBdlX	Sports;Hockey	Should the Bruins call up Tuukka Rask and trade Fernandez?	I'm Bruins fan here, and a big fan of Tuukka Rask as well. I see the Providence Bruins often as I live in southeastern, CT and it's a fairly close drive. While attending many P Bruins games i've seen a lot out of Tuukka Rask and he's a very skilled goalie.       My question is: Should the Boston Bruins trade Manny Fernandez for a quality player and call up Tuukka Rask permanently? I think it would be great to get an aging, and often injured Fernandez out of Boston and place one of their top prospects in the majors. He would get great experience playing in the NHL and with that would certainly have the potential to be a great future goalie.      Should they do it? As far as i'm aware they haven't discussed this, but Rask's new Boston Bruins mask seems to make me think he may be moving out of providence very soon.\

20090202135930AAgsZFj	Sports;Wrestling	Welcome back to TWE Revenge. come check out our show. WQ inside as well. Who's gonna win this week?	Welcome back to TWE Revenge last week on Revenge Kurt Angle defended the World Title against John Cena successfully. Also last week Kofi Kingston beat MVP, Vldamir Kozlov crushed Jamie Noble. The Great Khali made his Revenge debut and beat Batista. Victoria and Natalya beat Candice and Christy Hemme. And in the most heated match of the night Shelton Benjamin out fought CM Punk.         Event 1      The Show begins with TWE Chairman speaking from an office on the large Titron. He says that Revenge GM Shane McMahon cannot be with us tonight and that he will run Revenge tonight. He also says that he has an announcement for No Way Out involving The World Title. He says that Kurt Angle will defend his Title against 4 other opponents in a Championship Scramble Match. Those opponents will be will be John Cena, Batista, Vldamir Kozlov and The Great Khali. As a reminder of what this match consists of is that 2 Superstars will start the match then another Superstar will enter after 5 minutes untill all 5 Superstars are in the ring, they will then continue to fight for a further 10 minutes. Each time a Superstar scores a pinfall or Submission they will become Champion, but will only be crowned champion if at The end of The Match they were the last person to score a Pinfall or Submission. For tonight the contenders will compete in Tag Team action later on.         Event 2      Tag Team Championship contenders Match. The winners will face The Colon's at No Way Out      Team Priceless Vs Cryme tyme         Event 3      Diva's Match      Michelle McCool Vs Jillian Hall         Event 4      Kurt Angle is backstage with Randy Orton, Kurt thinks it is ridiculous that he has to defend his Title in a Scramble Match as he does not even have to get pinned to lose his Title. Vldamir Kozlov approaches and tells Kurt that he will not hold his title after No Way Out and that it will belong to him and will walk out as new Champion. Kurt tells him he has no chance and will walk out as champion. Royal Rumble winner Randy Orton steps in and says he will be awaiting the winner as he really does not care anymore who wins, but has deceided he will compete for The World Title at WrestleMania and will defeat who ever it is he faces.         Event 5      Kofi Kingston Vs Samoa Joe       Winner will face MVP for the IC Title         Event 6      Randy Orton Vs Shannon Moore         Event 7      Kurt Angle has approached The TWE Chairman requesting to speak to Shane McMahon. The Chairman reminds him that he is not avalible tonight. Kurt asks why has Shane put him in this Scramble Match to defend his Title. He is told it was not Shane's idea and that he (The Chairman) decided on it himself tonight. Kurt looks suprised and then asks why has he gone over Shane and announced this. The Chariman asks Kurt to leave and that it is his Show as well as Re-Born and what decisions he wants to make he can. He then announces that speaking of his decisions he had invited Re-Born's Triple H to speak on personal Terms as he is hear Kurt will have to Face him next.         Event 8      Kurt Angle Vs Triple H         Event 9      CM Punk is walking backstage, he is unaware, but Shelton Benjamin walks up behind him with a Steel Chair and attacks CM Punk. Shelton then walks off laughing leaving Punk battered on the floor.         Main Event      Tag Match      Batista and John Cena Vs Vldamir Kozlov and The Great Khali         Thankyou for viewing TWE Revenge, please vote for who you think should win each match and give the show a Rating.
