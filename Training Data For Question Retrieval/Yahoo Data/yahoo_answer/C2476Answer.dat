Some take in only professional photographers; others give you, say, 25c each time your photo is downloaded. <br>  <br>  Shutterstock.com is an example. If you take popular shots, they tend to be downloaded a fair bit. It only takes 40 downloads for you to get $10. As you get more popular… in a month, you could earn up to maybe a few hundred. <br>  <br>  But it’s all about finding the niche; what retailers, people, business look for.<br>  <br>  Or, check out some local retailers; especially if they annually give out brochures, calendars with irrelevant or relevant pictures.

Poems do not always have to rhyme, but if that's the route your taking, make sure the measures actually DO rhyme (ex. known and crown, opponents and events).  I get the feeling that if you rewrite it and not focus on rhyming so much, you'd do very nicely.  The story behind it is very interesting and I'd love to read more.  Good luck!

I was able to get my hands on a left handed guitar and it made a world of difference for me (I felt stiff and awkward with the righty but not the lefty).  I do, however, have friends that are also lefty yet play righty..don't ask how/why..they just do, and are actually comfortable playing right-handed (I'm not).  Your best bet is to go to any high-end music store and ask to try out both types..even if just to hold them..see which one feels natural to you.  Only then will you really know if you're a lefty or a righty with guitars.

The criminal police, known as the Kripo, imposed “preventive arrest” on professional criminals and numerous groups of so-called asocials: Roma (Gypsies), homosexuals, people with disabilities, prostitutes, and “shirkers”. The SS (Schutzstaffel, or protective units) operated the camps with brutal military discipline. During the 1930s six major camps were established: Dachau, Sachsenhausen, Buchenwald, Flossenbürg, Mauthausen, and, for women only, Ravensbrück. In 1939 these camps held about 25,000 prisoners. <br>  <br>  Early in 1942 the SS Central Office for Economy and Administration (Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt, or WVHA) assumed operational control of the concentration camps, and inmates were exploited as forced labourers in industrial production. In addition to the central camps, the WVHA operated hundreds of subsidiary camps, and local offices of the security police in the occupied territories maintained large numbers of forced labour camps. Inmates were worked to death in industries such as the I. G. Farben chemical works and the V-2 rocket factories. Those no longer able to work were killed by gassing, shooting, or fatal injections. Inmates were also used as subjects for medical experiments.|`|AA11203798	origin of concentration camps was british Invention during boer War in South Africa.

I know it was one of the first series of books that hooked me on reading.  For sci-fi, Kevin Anderson has the magic touch.  I have yet to find a book he has written that I did not enjoy.  Another fantasy writer that can get pretty detailed is Robert Jordan and his Wheel of Time saga.  A series that was supposed to be three books but ballooned into 12.  Well, 13 if you go with the splitting of the first book into two books.  I have also enjoyed David Eddings' books.  Start with Pawn of Prophecy, I think that is the first of the Belgariad series.  It finishes with the Mallorean series.  Then there are some books that come after that were written to fill out some of the main characters and their backstories.  He has three other series of books.  One, the Elenium, which starts with the Diamond Throne was pretty good too.  It has a second part to the series, I can't remember off the top of my head.  I have not read his books on Altheus or the Elder Gods series.  Terry Brooks is a great crossover for Sci fi and Fantasy.  His Sword of Shannara saga morphs into a bit of futuristic/post apocalyptic earth with it's link into the Knight of the Word series.  Start with Sword of Shannara then work your way through the rest of the books but read the Knight of the Word series before you read the Genesis of Shannara series.  You will not be disappointed with Brooks.<br>  <br>  Then too, nothing is quite like digging into the classics of fantasy and sci fi, Frank Herbert's Dune saga is great, Tolkein's Lord of the Rings will keep you busy, and if you want true Sci-Fi, it is hard to beat Larry Niven.

Fnp2MIycaa	Life in the Trenches<br>  <br>  - Death was a constant companion to those serving in the line, even when no raid or attack was launched or defended against. <br>  - Many men died on their first day in the trenches as a consequence of a precisely aimed sniper's bullet.<br>  - Rats in their millions infested trenches.<br>  Rats were by no means the only source of infection and nuisance.<br>  - Lice were a never-ending problem, breeding in the seams of filthy clothing and causing men to itch unceasingly.<br>  - Lice caused Trench Fever, a particularly painful disease that began suddenly with severe pain followed by high fever.  Recovery - away from the trenches - took up to twelve weeks. <br>  - Frogs by the score were found in shell holes covered in water; they were also found in the base of trenches.  Slugs and horned beetles crowded the sides of the trench.<br>  - Trench Foot was another medical condition peculiar to trench life.  It was a fungal infection of the feet caused by cold, wet and unsanitary trench conditions.  It could turn gangrenous and result in amputation.<br>  <br>  Finally, no overview of trench life can avoid the aspect that instantly struck visitors to the lines: the appalling reek given off by numerous conflicting sources.<br>  <br>  Rotting carcases lay around in their thousands.  For example, approximately 200,000 men were killed on the Somme battlefields, many of which lay in shallow graves.<br>  <br>  Overflowing latrines would similarly give off a most offensive stench.<br>  <br>  Men who had not been afforded the luxury of a bath in weeks or months would offer the pervading odour of dried sweat.  The feet were generally accepted to give off the worst odour.<br>  <br>  Trenches would also smell of creosol or chloride of lime, used to stave off the constant threat of disease and infection.<br>  <br>  Add to this the smell of cordite, the lingering odour of poison gas, rotting sandbags, stagnant mud, cigarette smoke and cooking food... yet men grew used to it, while it thoroughly overcame first-time visitors to the front.|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	A nitemare.........|`|h9WTWEylaa	My Uncle told me that when he went into the trenches he actualy saw blood  FLOWING  in the bottom of the trench!!!|`|TnIsuYqYaa	I don't think your gunna get any first hand accounts or descriptions here .|`|AA11203798	not very nice.|`|KADDz1EPaa	<a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FWW.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FWW...</a><br>  <br>  By a i|`|yKQKzKwMaa	Well of course I wasn't actually there, but imagine... horrible, twisting knots in your stomach.

z4Yeofq8aa	That's a very simplistic view of the events and not entirely correct. It would be more correct to say that Austria Hungary wanted justice for the assassination and threatened Serbia unless they complied and handed over all of the perpetrators. Serbia refused to comply although they did try to compromise by offering to prosecute them in a Serbian court.  Austria Hungary then mobilised their army. Russia in response mobilised their army with the intent of protecting Serbia. Germany and France responded likewise but Britain at that point had no intention of becoming involved, however when German trops advanced into neutral Belgium the British empire declared war on Germany and it became a global rather than a European conflict.|`|DSp8azw7aa	I believe so.|`|HVVTyfSgaa	yes . and millions had to die .|`|fLMCOSWdaa	OK, here's the right answer.  Franz ferdinand was in Sarajevo in pursuit of an Austrian claim to Bosnia Herzegovina, which had been part of the Turkish Empire.  The Serbs next door, who had also fought the Turks for Independence earlier having been conquered in the Middle Ages at the Battle of Kosovo, also claimed Bosnia because of the large numbers of Serbs there.  Franz ferdinand deliberately visite Sarajevo on the anniversary of the Battle of Kosovo, as a show of force.  Serbs living in Kosovo wanted to be part of Serbia.  The Black Hand were irredentists (go look it up) and resolved to kill Franz Ferdinand to teach the Austrians a lesson.  The Austrians then threatened war against Serbia, the Russians were in an alliance with Serbia and moved to fight the Austrians, the Germans, who were in an alliance with Austria needed to knock France, who was aallied withRussia, out of the war within three weeks in order to have time to move their troops across germany and confront the Russians.  To defeat the french, the Germans went through Belgium.  Belgium's independence was guaranteed by Great Britain under the Treaty of Paris 1829. Great Britain declared war.

The assassination was carried out by a terrorist group called ‘The Black Hand’. <br>  <br>  The assassination caused no real anguish in Austria, the officials there mainly disliked Franz Ferdinand’s political stance on the existence on Serbia (he felt that both Austria-Hungary and Serbia could exist in harmony) the Austrian government already felt that this was an opportunity for war, and on 5th July obtained a ‘blank cheque’ of support from Germany.<br>  <br>  The Austrian-Hungarian government saw the opportunity to subdue their ever strengthening neighbour. They composed an ultimatum that was so sever they felt that Serbia would either be inclined to reject it, or they would be able to declare war on Serbia.<br>  <br>  Serbia rejected only two points of the ultimatum (one of which was because they did not understand it fully) and because of this Austria-Hungary declared war. <br>  <br>  The assassination was merely the excuse for war being declared, however without it, its declaration may have been delayed and with it the First World War may have occurred years later.<br>  <br>  ----------------<br>  <br>  Austria-Hungary may have wanted to rule Serbia, but Franz Ferdinand was the last person to want this.... he was a pacifist and supported many Serbian ideals. It was infact the Austrian officials who hated him msot as they felt he was a weak point. Austria-Hungary wanted war anyway, to prove their dominance and to secure their crown (which was weakening).|`|KhiWV0Q0aa	Not exactly but very close .A part of austro hungary used to be apart of serbia and most of the citizens saw themselfs as serbian. and it was on there national holiday the archduke decided to parade around that part of austro hungary that used to be apart of serbia as you would imagne that was an insult(for example its like if  the UK took apart of america now and on the american day of independance they sent a prince to tour there silly but they were very proud of what country they came from) so the serbian ruler sent a gang called the black hand gand to kill him. they achived this but one of the gang forgot that people float when he tried to kill himselfs in a river.|`|TmgEbCrZaa	yup 100%<br>  but it wouldnt hurt to mention that the black hand gang tried to kill them, but failed first try, and after their failour, one of them coincidently saw them and shot them in the car|`|nSW09Bokaa	correct.<br>  that reali set it off, but there were many things that led to the start of the war|`|AA11203798	spot on.

Kr2TIUsAaa	It is quite rare to have an audition call for extras, specially if they are going to be used in crowd shots. As long as you fit the bill (example, you need to be this tall and x years old) they will take you in. <br>  <br>  Of course, there's an interview but not most have one. They call extras, you sign up (if you fit the requirements) and then you go to filming. <br>  <br>  Also, be prepared as extras are usually a tiring role to be in.|`|1enIWBGnaa	You wait until you see a 'casting call' in your local newspaper for extras.

Rw9gGBiWaa	So far I've only studied the last two but there are probably two quite obvious ways in which you could structure this essay; either choosing a topic like theme, language etc and doing a paragraph on each one and linking them with comparisons or you could do each poem separately and each paragraph can be about the different topics (again, eg theme, language etc). <br>  <br>  Also, i don't know if this will help, but basically I think the way that the poem is set out on the page always makes a reference to the tone/language etc of it. I usually find a way to put that into essays.<br>  <br>  Personally, I wouldn't include references to writing style since it's not a key element of what is asked. But that's really up to you.<br>  <br>  Hope this has somewhat helped hah. Good luck!
oXPDFw4daa	There is an optical illusion that if you have the top and bottom margins equal, the bottom margin will have the appearance of being smaller.  To compensate for that, tradition (in western cultures) is to make the bottom border slightly larger.  There are no hard dimensional rules - just the general notion that the bottom margin should be slightly larger than the top.|`|Bk4eIAWWaa	Balance. It weights the image.|`|sEhpGhj0aa	I think what you are talking about optical centering your images when you matte them.<br>  To make an image look right in the frame, it needs space. It also needs to be balanced. However, like everything else visual, there's a catch. The human eye won't see a mathematically correct center as correct. Instead, it sees the image as low in the frame or out of balance.<br>  <br>  Consequently, the image needs to be optically centered for display. Optical center is a position slightly higher in the frame (or a designed page) than the true center line. However, it must remain an equal distance from the left and right (vertically true).

You used really sophisticated words and phrases, but try not to make the story too typical, and use similes, metaphors, personification and hyperbole, and make sure these skills are performed making them relating to the genre.<br>  I really like this novel! Is it gonna continue?|`|a7M4V4Egaa	Very intriguing. I hope you continue to work on it. It always sucks when you loose inspiration.|`|qPTnm94caa	i thought it was great, an awesome idea. i like how you made john look, like hes isent the same as the old Little Miss Goodie Two Shoes heros, he could be corrupt Etc.... and i like how u added "But silence was overrated" :)<br>  <br>  i think you have a great gift but you need to stick with one thing, start with books, then go onto movies, it may take a while to make the step, but the only way 2 start it to right a great book.

Music seems to be the only thing that ever make sense now a days. When the world goes mad, you'll always have music. Music brightens the soul. Music makes you feel at place when things go array. So, music is what inspires me. It is what I live by, my creed. My life support. It's one of the two things that keeps me living. The other is God. But yes, music is what inspires me.

QE71sNC3aa	Doesn't the Custom have a set neck?<br>  <br>  I don't see the point anyway... I've heard the weaknesses in the Special are the neck, tuners, pickups and electronics. If anything... I'd start upgrading that stuff first instead of moving it all to a different body.<br>  <br>  I would probably start by putting in some name-brand pickups and tuners... then eventually upgrade to a Les Paul copy that's all mahogany with a set neck and put my good pickups and tuners in that. Then you'll have a pretty sweet guitar. Put the left over hardware from the better Les Paul copy on the Special and that will still be improved over stock too.|`|aw2xkdSbaa	I wouldn't bother using any of the hardware or electronics in your upgrade. The original body is probably the best thing on the guitar.  Buy the rest of the parts for your new guitar and build a whole new one yourself!

Include a few examples such as figure skating and gymnastics. You could also talk about stereotyping. You can mention famours movies, such as Billy Elliot and Dirty Dancing that has scenes of great male dancers. You could even mention TV shows such as Strictly Come Dancing/Dancing with the Stars. <br>  Also think about it the logical way- if there weren't any guys that could dance, where would girls find partners for ballroom or salsa dancing? What about the Royal Ballet, how would famous shows such as the Nutcracker be made without no men?<br>  Dance is meant for everyone. It's great exercise and a good way to meet people of your own age as well as to have fun. <br>  Also, mention the fact that dancers are usually as strong- maybe even stronger- than other athletes because over the years, their muscles build up a lot. Many people (especially boys) think that it's only meant for girls who go around waving their arms about, not really doing much. And it's not.<br>  I don't even know when or where this assumption came about. It's wrong- if girls can play rugby and football, surely boys can dance?! <br>  Below is a website of people talking on this topic. While you are having this debate, it would definitely help your argument if you showed some photos and videos of boys dancing well and maybe everyone will stop making the assumption that "dance is girly and therefore boys shouldn't dance".|`|Uxe1GjP0aa	Only a pole should dance.|`|L2UUj2hjaa	So I guess all the bboys are gay then?|`|phiJXEebaa	omg no,<br>  some boys makes wonderful dancers !<br>  and there not gay.. i mean look at channing tatum !|`|FAY7ZuECaa	Not all guys who dance are gay. I twirl baton and many people stereotype them to be gay also. But most of them are perfectly fine. In my twirling group we have a guy twirler and he is not gay. He has many girlfriends this year and he can twirl better than most girls on the team. So to answer you question not all guys that dance or twirl are gay they are only thought of that way because girls are all supposed to girly all the time.|`|GHPZlhAwaa	WHY?  Your assumption that only gay men dance is completely inaccurate.<br>  <br>  The people who make such an assumption do so in an effort to downplay the fact that they do not know how to dance.  I have been dancing all of my life and teaching ball room dancing and swing dancing for nearly 20 years and dancing is cool and has nothing to do with ones sexuality.  Dancing is not about sex, although in some cases like the tango, if done properly, it can be provocative.<br>  <br>  But dancing isn't about sex, it is about expressing oneself and ones partner to the music.  Sex usually comes from your performance off of the dance floor in being able to talk to the beautiful lady and show respect for her.  Dancing may certainly help open the door, but it is not a sure thing.<br>  <br>  whale|`|iCpDKt5Caa	not all guys who dance are gay!! i have the same problem in trying to convince my dad that theyre not all gay.. i believe that most boys and girls can dance but in pas de dux and stuff the guy is really only leading the girl and showing her off.. so in terms of actually 'dancing' the routine the girl is usually the main one being shown off and the guy is pretty much just dancing in the background, however the guys are just as important as the girls..<br>  :)|`|myjcOkVTaa	No, My boyfriend dances very well.

PEjEOZ3Gaa	Founded in 1788 as a British convict colony, Australia was a place of banishment until gold strikes in 1851 opened floodgates of immigration. Independence came in 1901, with a constitution adapted in part from that of the United States. Immigration has been key to Australia's development since 1788; from 1945 through 2000 almost six million immigrants arrived. Aborigines number about 517,000, and the government is making efforts to settle aboriginal land rights. Australia has one of the world's highest living standards with 85 percent living in urban areas.<br>  <br>  After 1945 Australia entered a boom period. Hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants arrived in Australia in the immediate post-war period, many of them young people eager to embrace their new lives with energy and vigour. The number of Australians employed in the manufacturing industry had grown steadily since the beginning of the century. Many women who had taken over factory work while men were away at war were able to continue working in peacetime.<br>  <br>  The economy developed strongly in the 1950s with major nation-building projects such as the Snowy Mountains Scheme, a hydro-electric power scheme located in Australia’s south-east mountain region. Suburban Australia also prospered. The rate of home ownership rose dramatically from barely 40 per cent in 1947 to more than 70 per cent by the 1960s.<br>  <br>  Other developments included the expansion of government social security programs and the arrival of television. Melbourne hosted the Olympic Games of 1956, shining the international spotlight on Australia. (In 2000, the Olympic Games came to Australia a second time, hosted by Sydney.)|`|Ezk53Ifmaa	Cyclone Tracy<br>  The Great Depression<br>  Gold Rush in Victoria<br>  Plague outbreaks in the early 1900's<br>  World Wars.

XOnSRoR2aa	I don't own a pole (I'm 17 & even though my parents are cool with the classes because they understand it's for fitness and fun rather than stripping, they aren't cool enough to be ok with me putting one up in my room), but several ladies from my class have the Xpole, and all their comments about it have been extremely positive. It's fully portable and does not require ceiling fixings or damage your home in any way, and it's stable and safe. Our instructor said to avoid the Peak-A-Boo because it will fall apart when you fly, and that the Flirty Girl Fitness Pole is also very unstable, but their home videos are great.<br>  <br>  The people who are scornful and critical of pole dancing and immediately associate all women who do it as strippers have a misconception about what pole fitness classes are really like (mine are just for girls, don't involve any stripping at all, and focus more on the dance and gymnastic elements), so ignore any unkind comments you may get to this question or to others you may ask.  <br>  <br>  Have fun! <br>  <br>  ~ Pax / Peace : )|`|200416208f6ad103a9e8e22b4202c849aa	I do recommend X-poles. They are wonderful to easily take down (not permanent) when guest come over or you want to put it in a different area of the home. They are more on the expensive side but you are paying for an excellent high top pole. The cheaper ones you will find in Spencer's for example (the one I had last), will fall apart, not make good use and has a risk of damaging ceilings as the ceiling base is drilled into the ceiling. (Pole can be taken down. Not the ceiling attachment unless unbolt it).<br>  <br>  X-pole not damage ceilings if used properly. Just make sure you read instructions and not abuse the pole for what it is intended to be used for. <br>  <br>  Now you do need to be-careful with renting because some landlords or managers can increase deposit or renter's insurance for having anything installed, whether it is easily taken down or permanent.<br>  <br>  We ran into that issue with the military base housing at Camp Pendleton. They said no way or we can be kicked out. Even if it is the safest and non damaging. So, we kinda sneaked one up but took it down after use in case they came and did a random inspection of the housing.<br>  <br>  So do know your policies, limits and abilities as a renter. <br>  <br>  After our baby is born this summer, I am finally getting my x-pole myself. With all the girls I took classes with, everyone of them recommends them. The size depends. some like the 45mm while others like the 50mm. I haven't decided yet which one I am going to get. It is easier going big to small, than small to big, I do know that.|`|XLvrlyxwaa	try and find a weighted base pole that dont even use the ceiling<br>  <br>  kind of like a portable basketball hoop<br>  <br>  google portable stripper pole maybe lol

When making choices you need to weigh up the odds and think about likely consequences. If you don't then you are more likely to make bad choices. I don't think people have the right to judge the choices other people make.

eIaqyOwraa	When you practice doing the splits make sure you warm up properly before hand. dont go straight into the splits once warmed up, you should do various stretches that focus on different part of your legs and ligament. be prepared to spend 30-45 minutes doing. once you have warmed and stretched all you leg muscles and ligaments go into half a split e.g. only fully extend one leg while keeping the other leg bent, then ease the other leg into position as far as you can to perform the split. dont think going through a lot of pain will help you become flexible, repeatedly practicing is the key for a lifetime of flexibility. GOOD LUCK.|`|FAY7ZuECaa	I was also teaching my self to do splits and I mastered the left and right in about six months or so. I do baton twirling so that was the whole reason why I started to but every time before I twirl, I stretch my legs for 5 minutes. I did that about 3 times a week. <br>  First I usually start by stretching my arms out. Then I place my feet about one and a half feet apart. Then try to touch your head to your knee and hold as long as you can and do the same to other leg. Lunge to the left and the right.<br>  Pull your feet together and reach down and touch your toes and hold as long as you can. Then try and to touch your head to your knees remember to keep your knees straight the whole time. <br>  Next spread your legs out to sides as far as you can like you are doing a straddle and sit down on the ground. Touch your toes with your hands and with both hands touch your left foot and bring you head to your knee do the same for other side and hold as long as you can.<br>  Pull your feet together and your butt should be on the ground. reach down ans touch your toes and if you can already touch your toes then pull your heels off the ground with your hands and hold it there. Then take your head and touch to your knees and hold as long as you can.<br>  <br>  * The longer you hold some exercises the better the result.<br>  Finally go down into your left or right spilt and go down as far as you can and use your hands to support yourself and hold there as long as you can and then do the same to the other side. <br>  Results might be faster or slower depending on how often you do it. Be careful not to pull a muscle or injure yourself while doing these exercises. Hope I helped.|`|p7IrPXFgaa	You are like me i am teaching myself to do the splits. I got advice from my dance teacher: <br>  1) Sit down and put your legs in the frog strech.<br>  2) After that lie on your back, then kick one of your legs. One leg at a time.<br>  3) Repeat that on both of your sides and front. Kick your legs 10-15 times.<br>  4)Keep on doing that for 2 weeks and you will see a difference. Keep on doing this even if you can do the splits. One more thing push your self.|`|Ia8pJg1iaa	A method I learnt from my dance teacher is to lie down on the floor with your legs resting on a wall, so your legs are flat against the wall, then to each of your feet tie a heavy bag or something heavy so that it brings your legs down. Remember to keep your legs straight. The longer you hold it for the less times you'll have to keep doing this. Be careful when getting up as your legs will feel funny indeed!|`|WAEDIWz8aa	yep, once u stop u will not be able to do it again.<br>  <br>  so u have to practise every day.<br>  <br>  the best exercise for spilits. is to position urself for a split, and try to hit the floor. stay there for a couple of seconds and change to the other leg.<br>  <br>  and other method is to sit down on the floor, open ur legs, and strecth forwards, left and right. and keep practising every day.<br>  <br>  u will get it :)<br>  <br>  i used to do over splits and was really flexible. i stopped completely, and now i only do the right split. and it hurts hehehe. but when i practise, it wont hurt.|`|cmI9e4u6aa	ouch
FLAtdWrmaa	Well, think of what was happening all through the Victorian decades in the many fields of science, and how these developments were reflected in the news-events and in the popular literature of the times.  In some ways, Victorians would see anything scientific as having the potential to be the "magic bullet" that would do away with yet another age-old problem.<br>  <br>  So, when the darkest, most evil criminal mysteries could be solved (and even rectified) using logic coupled with scientific methods, you can imagine what the popular reaction would be.  Take this one step further, and use logic and method to discover the truth behind apparently *supernatural* (read: unsolvable) mysteries, and ........ well, do I really need to explain further?   :-D<br>  <br>  Did you ask about this for homework, a classroom discussion, an essay, or a speech?|`|AA11530144	The same reason we do today? its a good example because its a good detective story? I deduce you where after a protracted answer for your homework?|`|wBtty5IGaa	Sherlock Holmes believed in reason. He confidently used scientific laws to arrive at ideas. This was a central theme in the Victorian era. At the time Darwin had been talking about evolution and this challenged the beliefs of the people causing more emphasis on science and logic than before. I don't really know how Baskervilles in particular is a good example of that, but it should be noted Scotland Yard started using fingerprints the year it was released
Zxt7nhUiaa	Make a portfolio of pictures to show you can do different looks for different roles in a movie, make some short films and post them on the Internet and get traffic on your videos, i done this on youtube and myspace.<br>  <br>  And fish the Internet for sites that give you information on where auditions are going to be in your area (its best to travel for the role, shows people you want it) watch because some sites want money to do this but if you look hard enough you will find one for free.<br>  <br>  Determination, you need a image and stick at it, learn to take criticism and sarky comments and keep on going.<br>  <br>  you will fail and get nothing for a long time but its all about chance, eventually something will pop up.<br>  <br>  its near enough the same as the modeling business.|`|qLvhoRpsaa	Search for casting companies. I do not know where you live, but for instance, where I live, I just googled (perhaps I should "say" Yahoo) and found 3 legitimate casting agencies that are in the big city near where I live. <br>  <br>  Google or Yahoo, is your friend!<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Peace:)|`|Kr2TIUsAaa	You need an agent to do the work for you since you are still in school or your parents if they know what to do. The agent is responsible to look for roles that you might want to take. <br>  <br>  However, most movie auditions (specially big ones) are not done in person at all. Most are taped by you and sent to the producers or whoever views the auditions. <br>  <br>  It is also competitive. I think you should start with stageplays (in school or not) and be discovered.|`|uNul8l0Faa	most of your big city news papers have ads for auditions and modeling etc.

I think you can take it from there..|`|K75OmKHzaa	.............. errrrr why would he look after you if you were sick?  Wouldn't his sister do that?

fpbLkbJzaa	Christianity has always held that sins must be either repented (and therefore forgiven) or punished in some way -so this is by no means just an Elizabethan belief. Different branches of the faith hold different views on both the practice of avoiding sin (eg by faith only) - who has the power to forgive - and the extent/duration of any punishment before or after death.<br>  When I was a kid the Catholic Church was big on cime and punishment - terrifying children with ideas (and nightmares) of eternal sufferings in the flames of Hell.  Despite no foundation for such claims, priests and nuns categorised types of sin so that, for example, if you died having not confessed a 'venial sin' you would go to a place called Purgatory and suffer for a limited time before being allowed into Heaven.  However you could earn 'indulgences' by prayers or good works.  This could earn you, say, 100 days off your time of suffering.<br>  All this pap and nonsense was to under-pin the power and control of priests, appointed by bishops, appointed by cardinals , who were appointed by the Pope - the top banana who claimed authority for governing the church as a direct successor of St Peter himself - Christ's representative on earth.  (All males, of course.)<br>  The Tudor period saw the most vicious internicene warfare, persecution, torture etc following the Reformation, ie the split with Rome, the Protestants refusing to accept the Pope's authority (which in those days had huge political significance).<br>  In such times refusing to follow the Reformist or Papal diktats could get you burnt at the stake - seen as a way of purifying the world from heresy.<br>  (And an automatic ticket to Hell). <br>  In more enlightened times most accept such teachings and practices are totally irreconcilable with belief in an all-loving and merciful God.  The concept of 'Original sin' begs the question as to why God designed humans in such a way (the capacity to sin was a racing certainty that we would sin) and the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross was therefore a crucial, essential  part of God's plan. (As all-seeing, he or she must have foreseen the way things would go.)<br>  Many of us regard the whole business as nonsensical/illogical and whilst having respect for those with 'faith' I personally believe it's a man-made invention, with an underlying purpose of repressing females.<br>  OK, I can't explain the point or meaning of life but then the clerics are equally unable to prove their claims. There's an overwhelming lack of evidence for what they hold to be The Gospel Truth.|`|kmgDBiCiaa	It depended on the person you were looking at. Elizabethan Times saw the Revolution and the Counter Revolution, so some were Catholic and some were Protestant. As this was during the late 1500s, the Renaissance was already well under way, so there was a bit of a rise towards humanism and individualism-just classical thought in general. Calvin said you were predestined to heaven or to hell and your actions in life reflected that, whereas Catholocism thought that if you repented for your sins you could still go to heaven.|`|kJ4g1vujaa	Thats a very interesting question and it was the heart of the conflict between Protestant and Catholic.  The Elizabethans were not all Protestants, there was a war going on in religious thought - the Reformation and the Counter Reformation.<br>  <br>  The Puritans seemed to believe in the the idea of the elect.  Some people were destined for hell and some for heaven.|`|NjOmMVZ7aa	Historically, the Elizabethans were of the Protestant religion. They followed the Book of Common Prayer instituted by Edward the Sixth, and yes, they did believe that sin must be either repented or paid for.|`|jpkpVyesaa	probably they were mad then.<br>  there weren't any scientists or humanists about, and if there were they would be horribly tortured and killed.|`|bxlYleZkaa	That is nonsense.
kSYtcENRaa	be sure to get an agent who know what they are doing.  most of them take on too many actors and this will reduce the quality of auditions you get. <br>  <br>  remember that there are millions of actors, it may take  a while till you get your big break (or any break at all). <br>  <br>  although private auditions are more likely to get you further quicker, open auditions are just as good if you are talented. <br>  <br>  a day job may come in handy (especially during these tight financial times) but this doesn't mean it has to be a job not in the entertainment industry. there are plenty of opportunities. <br>  <br>  make sure you are acting a-lot (amateur productions, any other acting things) as this may get you noticed and will increase your skill and experience. <br>  <br>  patience is key.|`|Ct2sQ5Ciaa	Yes you should definitely have a back up plan as it is very difficult to break into acting and even if you did there are always going to be times when you are not working.  I would go for a job where you work for yourself (self-employed) so that you can go for auditions etc.|`|pkZBBvlzaa	try to make a showreel and get an agent|`|VykkX7TEaa	Some people dont really need experience they just turn up at an audition and get the part|`|RVUYBxhnaa	Get yourself an agent =)<br>  They find shows and auditions for you that they think would best suit you. <br>  Good luck!|`|phiJXEebaa	you could audtiion for shows.|`|KoK7YJodaa	You say college; are you in an accredited drama school or a university?

65109cb8f29d34e3d6fc411bd1edae58aa	Not even close.<br>  <br>  I have yet to see an inkjet print, even an pigment inkjet print, that compares to the acuity and tonality of a well printed large format negative on silver gelatin B&W paper.|`|xYAuW0Wqaa	It's like what Monophoto's explanation. but more. There are several gradients of the gray tones that the B/W film will show in the final print. If you are using the Zone system of processing you will see the different shade of gray between Black and White. For most people you may only see 7 oar 8 shade of gray. That with the highlights the intensity of the gray shades will make that print really stand out. I don't think the digital cameras have the capability to record the same amount of information that film has shown over the years.<br>  Film has not been defined to a specific pixel size as the digital format and the printing of the film is not really defined as in digital. The print size for film is limited to the quality of the medium that it is printed on.|`|c1c37eae322227154890ab2726673b64aa	In terms of output,i mean the photo results,they are almost the same. the difference is in the manner by which a photograph is made into B/W.In digital B/W, its just changing mode in your digital camera setting,while in B/W film photography, you load a roll of B/W film into a rangefinder or an SLR camera,shoot and have the film processed in developer,stop bath and fixer. After that, printing will done in a light controlled room,called a darkroom. using an enlarger,you place the negative strip into the negative carrier while placing a B/W photo paper at the base of enlarger. Do some test prints, and select proper exposure.expose,then place exposed photo paper into developer,stop bath, fixer and running water. each stage require timing. Then place photo paper into print dryer.that's more or less is B/W film photography. I hope it helps.|`|oXPDFw4daa	Digital photographers can easily produce black and white images.  Almost all newspaper and magazine photography these days is digital, and much of that is black and white.<br>  <br>  It is also possible to produce black and white 'fine prints'  digitally.  However, fine art black and white photography often relies on subtle gradations in tonality that cannot be achieved digitally, especially in highlights.

090Uv4sKaa	My view on life is rather pessimistic, as some would say, or bleak.<br>  <br>  I believe that life is not meant to be happy, or good, or pure. It is not meant to be easy. It is a series of trials - some big, some seemingly insignificant - that we have to face and overcome. No one has it easy.<br>  <br>  In the middle of all this, we find happiness where we can. In friendship, music, watching movies or getting drunk. Everyone has their own techniques.<br>  <br>  The sadness is already there. We create happiness where we can. We create sadness too, but it's a part of being human.<br>  <br>  xxx|`|AA11219693	Would there be any light, or darkness would there be, without the keen eye of the observer in the middle of the twilight zone of life, or standing to face the breaking dawn; would there be any truth to seek, or lies to detect, if the ever-inquisitive mind were not prowling along the regions of uncertainty; and there would be no love, or dejection, happiness or sorrow, without the arrow of doubt lodged deep into a heart of faith - life exist in the middle of contrasts, like morning between night and day. <br>  <br>  If ‘life is like an interwoven fabric of love and sadness’, the delicate voile, then we are the weavers earnestly try to fill its stretches with all the wonderful patters and designs, with tassels and laces of reason along its sides.

DIlNnjf8aa	The Christian "Lord's Resistance Army" (LRA) operating in Uganda is the world's No. 1 terrorist organization and it specializes in the rape and torture of children. Tens of thousands of children have been massacred by the LRA in its military campaign to force Uganda to adopt the Ten Commandments as the national constitution. This has been going on since the 80s.

Very young girls are given to the local temple priest to be raped and he then collects money by prostituting them.

wKKxUNzyaa	Hi,<br>  When I was writing my sword fighting scene basically for my medieval themed war/battle I looked up fighting technique and how the swords were shaped and made. This gave me great insight and extra depth when writing such scenes. It may help you as well. It's also extremely fascinating! :) So it's worth a look!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! Good Luck with your writing!|`|dzfArr3daa	Describe the senses of the fight.<br>  This is an example describing a hand-hand fight.<br>  Smell:air rushing through nostrils a smell of sweat and heat.<br>  Hearing:flutter of clothes,the beating of flesh on bone-bone on flesh.the sound of dice rolling across the floor(teeth)<br>  Taste:copper and saliva hot air out cold air in.<br>  OR<br>  Both swords moved differently one smooth and fluid the other swift and cautious like a serpent and spider.<br>  <br>  Describe there feet movements ie clumsy,taking fast but short steps.<br>  They were caught in a death waltz(or any other dance,Tango?)<br>  (the better fighter)was leading(the other) they rotated stabbing,evading, diverting each other's steel with the others scitimar(insert sword)<br>  When one would sieze the oppurtunity and strike hard the other would recoil like a party go-er half bowing,gesturing for a dance.<br>  <br>  If its on the lines of an epic battle <br>  (chracter)and(character) entertained a row of swords and shields unable to retreat while (character)had his back to them carving through walls of soldiers half blinded by blood and his own sword movements.<br>  <br>  There are many different styles try JRR Tolkins style if you want heroic battles.|`|YQGbOXhYaa	Make the reader feel as if he or she was there.

That can get dramatic, if ppl like the character|`|za9b8cHKaa	Show don't tell, use lively colourful language. Try to make the reader feel as though they are in the middle of the scene rather than just reading it - describe the smells, sounds and feel of the fight.|`|AA10676702	Just a suggestion, but I'd say to elaborate on the feelings of the characters and the details of the swords, the surroundings, the environment in general. If you feel you're using the same word over and over you can always turn to our good old friend the Thesaurus. Don't overuse him though, you'll come off trite and stilted. <br>  <br>  I concentrate on the emotions behind the scene and the little things that you usually wouldn't think much about. They make a lot of difference in visuals. For instance, you could use a spark of sunlight reflecting off of the opponents sword momentarily blocking your character's vision. Maybe another idea would be your character describing the malice in the antagonist's face, along with the sandy dirt rising from his feet as he shuffles positions. <br>  <br>  Detail and emotion can be your best friends but use them as you use your keyboard. Lightly tap and play with your words, and before you know it you won't even have to look. ;)

For instance, a beautiful redention of Romeo and Juliet was done in the form of ballet. That film has nothing to do with dancing, but the passionate dance accurately portrays the love and tragedy.

KoK7YJodaa	No, you don't need to go to college, but it would help to attend a drama school to hone natural talent and get vocationally trained for the professional industry. Drama schools provide you with a great start, as they invite casting directors and agents to your showcases. These are for 18+ year olds and there are different types of courses e.g. acting, musical theatre, dance, directing, and different lengths of courses, 1-2 year diplomas and 3 year degree courses. By saying GCSEs I guess your from the UK, so you should look in the CDS: The Conference of Drama Schools for some of the top 22 schools in the UK. And to get in you don't need drama at GCSE. They mainly rely on auditions when offering places, but they like you to hav A levels or a BTEC in any subjects. You don't need a Drama GCSE to get into a university drama course either. But don't just rely on a set pattern to see you through because everyone is different. Keep looking for opportunities to better your skills and abilities and developing skills in music and dance can also better your employment opportunities later on. Hope this helps. Best of luck.|`|Ct2sQ5Ciaa	Yes you do need to go to a college like Rada.  It is a really difficult profession to break into and you do need to have some natural talent to get anywhere.  You will eventually need an agent which again is difficult to get hold of as they will only take you on if you have some experience (showreels) of the professional equity work you have done.  Also you must belong to equity to be able to attend auditions for acting and to enable them to accept you, you must have done a speaking part in something (you can get lucky sometimes doing extra work) and get asked to speak a few words.  All in all you must really want to do this as there are a lot of knock backs and rejections and it can take years to get anywhere.  If you still think you want to be an actress - good luck!|`|3e35f384e6ba91685b275ec068631f7daa	Everyone needs education|`|uNul8l0Faa	there is never a quick way to the top of any career, but yes you do need to take Drama and don't worry about an agent right at this time, you do not need one|`|kQM2CZkXaa	you don't NEED to, but it wouldn't hurt. if you're naturally a good actress you can make it without formal education

ceBTTCPwaa	Nineteen Eighty-Four is a classic dystopian novel by English author George Orwell. Published in 1949, it is set in the eponymous year and focuses on a repressive, totalitarian regime. The story follows the life of one seemingly insignificant man, Winston Smith, a civil servant assigned the task of perpetuating the regime's propaganda by falsifying records and political literature. Smith grows disillusioned with his meager existence and so begins a rebellion against the system that leads to his arrest and torture.<br>  <br>  The novel has become famous for its portrayal of pervasive government surveillance and control, and government's increasing encroachment on the rights of the individual. Since its publication, many of its terms and concepts, such as "Big Brother," "doublethink" and "Newspeak" have entered the popular vernacular. The word "Orwellian" itself has come to refer to anything reminiscent of the book's fictional regime.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/Nineteen_Eighty-..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/Nineteen_Eighty-...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/1..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/1...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.awerty.com/19842.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.awerty.com/19842.html</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/1984/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/1984/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/1984/index.htm..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/1984/index.htm...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?articl..." rel="nofollow">http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?articl...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a>|`|6StMUFgkaa	Winston seems to stand alone in this novel because the current regime rejects individualism in all respects.

Given that he was a young man, relatively inexperienced on the international stage, he had room for improvement, but he was learning.  He was very popular with the public, probably because of his youth and optimism, and would have been re elected.  Yes he made some mistakes, but was quick to recognize them and correct them.  Most likely would not have let American involvement in Viet Nam escalate as it did.  Was also a staunch civil rights advocate and may have averted the racial riots of the 1960s.<br>  <br>  I would grade him a 7 or 8 out of a possible 10, with a grade of B or B+|`|ZYCRkgawaa	Yes and no.<br>  <br>  He spent way too much time womanizing and not just with Marilyn Monroe, but with Judith Exner, a girlfriend he shared with the Mafia.<br>  <br>  He inspired people and much of what he did wrong was not public knowledge when he was president.<br>  <br>  The reason he was assassinated may not be known for sure in our time, however I believe it is mainly because once he was elected, at great expense to a lot of donaters, many criminal, that he refused to pay back through favors, and even went after the Mafia or Mob. the mob thought they owned him.<br>  <br>  You don't fool with organized crime. Bobbie Kennedy as attorney general did the same thing. JFK's father earned much of his wealth from illegal whiskey during Prohibition and bought the presidency for JFK with teamster and mob money and promises.<br>  <br>  He did keep us from a nuclear war over Cuba, but he also brought us to the edge of it. Once the plot to invade Cuba failed, he blamed a lot of people including the CIA, so he had few friends left by the time of the assassination.  He was considered uncooperative as a political figure by then. Unpredictable.<br>  <br>  So, the short answer to your question, he gave us hope and continued a quest to help the poor. But for me, like Clinton, I do not consider a president who spends so much of his time cheating on his wife, can be spending enough time on his job. Also, Kennedy was on a large amount of pain pills, etc, so he was medically distracted much of the time too.|`|42fd9971ce3e862ed92126c35a6addccaa	Of course! He was a great president because most of his ideas changed America forever.

We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.<br>  The first decision is; do we want to control our lives, or rely on outside forces. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects.<br>  <br>  This document is intended for those who want to control their lives and accept that causes produce effects. The question naturally occurs, “What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?” The causes must be based on what is pragmatically verifiable, yet universally true. <br>  <br>  Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the Japanese words Myoho.  Why use Japanese words? The concept originated in Japan and can’t be expressed as well in another language.<br>  <br>  Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.<br>  <br>  Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is. <br>  <br>  The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life. <br>  <br>  This formulation serves as a life decryption key.<br>  Add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This, spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together, focuses the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.

It was sneaking up onto of the largest naval base the US had in the Pacifc, of course the US is going to react.<br>  <br>  Chu, saying that the US made the first move would be like some burglars claiming I made the first move for shooting one of them.  Even though they had climbed over my fence, subdued my dog, and were trying to get in through my window, while armed with submachine guns.

After leaving school, he worked in a department store before moving to London for two years in his early twenties to develop a writing career. He wrote many historical novels, particularly about famous women in history.

If you're just out of school, then you probably won't get in, because NIDA tend to take people with 'life experience'. You should basically have a lot of amateur productions under your belt, school and extra-curricular classes, talents other than acting (ie. singing, dancing), and perhaps some professional roles too.<br>  <br>  Make sure you do drama in year 11 and 12 and it's a good idea to have good grades :)  <br>  <br>  Also, consider taking any of NIDA's short course programs - they often offer them throughout the year and is an excellent way to meet the people who run the course and see what they expect.<br>  <br>  Head to www.theatre.asn.au, there are a number of threads from people asking similar questions.<br>  <br>  Don't forget: even if you don't get in, the audition can be used as a learning experience and to prepare for next year's attempt; and that you can always take another acting course and use it as a stepping stone to NIDA.|`|ji7WZvC1aa	A lot of talent, a huge amount of potential and a certain amount of luck.
J58okEzraa	Do you seriously believe that every single one of these phenomenon could possibly be hoaxes? I'd say that out of sheer probability, at least some must be true. Furthermore, I know that there is much in this world that we (by which I mean mainstream media/science and western culture) are ignorant of, and I would not for a second dismiss the possibility of something like ghosts or poltergeists being real. By the same token, I am equally sure that there are many many hoaxes and misguided people who make false reports. Conclusion: Don't be so sure of anything.|`|houWY7qvaa	If you saw one you would believe.  If you did not see one then anyone else who did would have a hard time explaining what they did see, and with all the people out here lying about this that and the other, who can tell if that person isn't lying as well?  When someone says, Yes. They believe, it's most likely because they saw something that looked real, yet was transparent, or you could see what was behind it, but there is always someone, who wasn't there or doesn't really know, trying to dispute what you see from your own eyes.  Or, they try to analyze it entirely.  I haven't seen UFO's but heard of some reputable people who claim they have.  THe same goes for Bigfoot and the Lochness monster.  I never saw them.

8asG4WCwaa	It takes about a year, generally, to give the hardcover time to sell out.<br>  <br>  Publishers crunch the numbers to decide if the expected sales in the target market are favorable for a hardback.  If not, the book debutes in paperback.  If yes, then they have a few marketing choices - delay the paperback release if hardback sales are still doing well, release the paperback when hardback sales level off but interest is still there, release paperback early if the demand of the target market will allow both to sell well, or drop the paperback altogether if the hardback sales have declined too much (interrest is falling).  Such decisions are based on knowledge and previous experience with the market.  <br>  <br>  A market that appeals largely to teens may see paperbacks sooner than a market that appeals mainly to adults, but only in certain genres, for example.  Even though teens have a greater portion of disposable income (fewer bills to pay so their money can be spent of "goodies"), they are generally not hardback buyers because of the expense (some are, most are not).<br>  <br>  The demographics of a target market can be a big factor in the decision, including where they buy their books.  Are the readers less likely to be able to afford a hardback? Young mothers or the elderly who are on a tight budget, for example.  Children whose families might not be able to afford new hardbacks for their children ever month. Romance books like Harlequins that are offered at grocery store checkout lines are often bought on "money left over", so will not be released in hardback at bookstores unless the individual title sold really well.  <br>  <br>  Is the most likely reader a member of an ethnic group that is largely poor (I know, that sounds bad, but it is applicable)?  Similarly, a hardback that is still selling well might do pretty good at the same time in a paperback translation to spanish in many areas of the country. <br>  <br>  Some authors were originally published only in paperback, but the fanbase that has developed over they years is now willing to buy their work in hardback (even reprints of the original paperbacks in hardcover will sell).  Other authors are expected to form a fanbase rather quickly, and are released first in hardback (sometimes this just doesn't work out as well as was expected).  Some publishers only debute work in either hardback or in paperback (especially in some genres).  <br>  <br>  In years past, some genres only debuted an new author in hardback if the work was really good (it was quite a thrill to be offered hardback).  Readers figured this out, and now some publishers debute even average work in hardback to capitalize on this.  <br>  <br>  While hardbacks have better profit from actual sales, paperbacks are less expensive overall in both printing and returns (because a paperback can be stripped and pulped much cheaper, and distribution costs are less,too).  Many publishers will limit the print run of hardbacks but be willing to over print paperbacks because of this.  You see remainders of hardbacks sold at deep discounts often, but rarely remainders of paperbacks.<br>  <br>  Tradebacks are a whole new problem.  Cheaper because of the softcover, but not necessarily pulpable because of the glossy paper inside.  Distribution costs are still higher than paperbacks, because of their size even though they weigh less than hardbacks.  The still have to be shelved like hardbacks because the paperback market does not include racks of that size.  Some publishers will print tradebacks after the initial sale of hardbacks. A few publishers are printing first in tradeback rather than hardback based on the demographics of the target market (like textbooks, where students can use a break in coverprice, but resale is poor).  I find it interesting that some book stores will not carry tradebacks (I'm guessing either the wholesale discount is not as good as hardback or the customer base prefers hardback).<br>  <br>  Yeah, way more information than you asked for :-)|`|93Qsecscaa	Once a book comes out in hardcover it will generally take 6 months before it then comes out in trade paperback (the same size as a hardcover, but with a soft cover ... does that make sense?). Then after another 6 months it comes out in paperback, which is what I assume you mean when you say "soft cover".<br>  <br>  There are a number of reasons it comes out in hardcover first but its mainly because the publishers can charge a lot more for a hardcover and therefore get more profit out of the book. <br>  <br>  Have you ever noticed that its only really the popular authors or the ones who might become popular that have hardcover books come out first eg. Bryce Courtney, John Grisham, James Patterson, Kathy Reichs, JK Rowling etc. <br>  <br>  Also some people prefer hardcover because as a rule they tend to last a lot longer than a paperback.<br>  <br>  I hope that answers your question.|`|OhGxSpm7aa	it takes quite some time, depending on the book and publisher. If the book receives good demands or so, the publisher will probably publish the soft-cover one faster. likewise, if the book does not sell well, the publisher might not even publish the soft-cover ones, as it will cause them to lose money! :p|`|a7yj0kZcaa	I've noticed that it usually takes about a year. Way too long if you ask me. Soft covers are so much cheaper and easier to read from, I think.|`|nANyAvzgaa	I think it takes about 30 days to three months.|`|NwpGhT31aa	LOL! Whenever I first saw your question I though you meant like how long will the hard cover on the book turn soft! I was like what!?!?!?!<br>  <br>  Then I got it. I think I need sleep. lol. It usually depends on the author or publisher. See I am opposite though. I like hard better because I am clumsy and end up messing the soft cover of the book up and then I get all OCD about and don't want it anymore. Unless I have the first book in the series soft then they ALL have to be soft. I guess I am weird about my books.

shVgCizBaa	The deflation spiral           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depre...</a><br>   The Great Depression was triggered by a sudden, total collapse in the stock market. The stock market turned upward in early 1930, returning to early 1929 levels by April, though still almost 30 percent below the peak of September 1929.[10] Together, government and business actually spent more in the first half of 1930 than in the corresponding period of the previous year. But consumers, many of whom had suffered severe losses in the stock market the previous year, cut back their expenditures by ten percent, and a severe drought ravaged the agricultural heartland of the USA beginning in the summer of 1930.<br>  <br>  In early 1930, credit was ample and available at low rates, but people were reluctant to add new debt by borrowing.[citation needed] By May 1930, auto sales had declined to below the levels of 1928. Prices in general began to decline, but wages held steady in 1930, then began to drop in 1931. Conditions were worse in farming areas, where commodity prices plunged, and in mining and logging areas, where unemployment was high and there were few other jobs. The decline in the US economy was the factor that pulled down most other countries at first, then internal weaknesses or strengths in each country made conditions worse or better. Frantic attempts to shore up the economies of individual nations through protectionist policies, such as the 1930 U.S. Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act and retaliatory tariffs in other countries, exacerbated the collapse in global trade. By late in 1930, a steady decline set in which reached bottom by March 1933.<br>  Debt deflation<br>    Fisher argued that the predominant factor leading to the Great Depression was overindebtedness and deflation. Fisher tied loose credit to over-indebtedness, which fueled speculation and asset bubbles.[12] He then outlined 9 factors interacting with one another under conditions of debt and deflation to create the mechanics of boom to bust. The chain of events proceeded as follows:<br>  <br>  Debt liquidation and distress selling <br>  Contraction of the money supply as bank loans are paid off <br>  A fall in the level of asset prices <br>  A still greater fall in the net worths of business, precipitating bankruptcies <br>  A fall in profits <br>  A reduction in output, in trade and in employment. <br>  Pessimism and loss of confidence <br>  Hoarding of money <br>  A fall in nominal interest rates and a rise in deflation adjusted interest rates.[12] <br>   <br>  Crowd gathering on Wall Street after the 1929 crash.During the Crash of 1929 preceding the Great Depression, margin requirements were only 10%.[citation needed] Brokerage firms, in other words, would lend $9 for every $1 an investor had deposited.[citation needed] When the market fell, brokers called in these loans, which could not be paid back. Banks began to fail as debtors defaulted on debt and depositors attempted to withdraw their deposits en masse, triggering multiple bank runs. Government guarantees and Federal Reserve banking regulations to prevent such panics were ineffective or not used. Bank failures led to the loss of billions of dollars in assets.[13] Outstanding debts became heavier, because prices and incomes fell by 20–50% but the debts remained at the same dollar amount. After the panic of 1929, and during the first 10 months of 1930, 744 US banks failed. (In all, 9,000 banks failed during the 1930s). By April 1933, around $7 billion in deposits had been frozen in failed banks or those left unlicensed after the March Bank Holiday.[14]<br>  <br>  Bank failures snowballed as desperate bankers called in loans which the borrowers did not have time or money to repay. With future profits looking poor, capital investment and construction slowed or completely ceased. In the face of bad loans and worsening future prospects, the surviving banks became even more conservative in their lending.[13] Banks built up their capital reserves and made fewer loans, which intensified deflationary pressures. A vicious cycle developed and the downward spiral accelerated.The liquidation of debt could not keep up with the fall of prices which it caused. The mass effect of the stampede to liquidate increased the value of each dollar owed, relative to the value of declining asset holdings. The very effort of individuals to lessen their burden of debt effectively increased it. Paradoxically, the more the debtors paid, the more they owed.[12] This self-aggravating process turned a 1930 recession into a 1933 great depression.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression#Causes" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depre...</a>

spYpsixUaa	Egotists are all about "It's all about me!" True selfishness is all about the person's own needs.  I think it is probably an assessment of the perspective that showboating is not a selfish need, and therefore egotists are ignoring their real needs when they insist upon that attention-getting impulse.  A truly selfish person would pursue their own goals with no concern for the attention that it garners, while an egotist pursues the attention earned by representing something which may or may not have a goal at all.|`|AA11114869	That Rand would say that egoTISTS are 'selfless' does seem, on its face, a bit contradictory when both the egoIST and the egoTIST are driven by the pursuit of that which benefits themselves.<br>  <br>  What I believe Rand was getting at was that egoTISTs are 'selfless' because their sole expectations have everything around them catering to their well-being and, to that goal, - with no effort of ''themselves'; not even the 'selfless' effort it would take to consider improving ways in which others could cater to their 'selfish' whims.<br>  <br>  I think this meshes well with Nietzsche's view of an 'ascending or descending line of life', mentioned in his book, TWILIGHT Of THE IDOLS:<br>  ---... "Every individual may be regarded  as representing the ascending or descending line of life...  If he represents the ascending line his value is in fact extraordinary - and for the sake of the life-collective, which with him take a step FORWARD, the care expended... on the creation of optimum conditions for him, may even be extreme...<br>  If he represents the descending development,... then he can be accorded little value, and elementary fairness demands the he TAKES AWAY as little as possible from the well-constituted.

SygvUa0Eaa	Okay, first of all... You NEVER want to use, "He/she was scared" or "This frightened him/her". It's just too boring, and the reader doesn't get the feel for what you're trying to get across to them.<br>  <br>  Here's an example of what I think would be a decent paragraph:<br>  <br>  Someone could be heard from around the corner. The silence which filled the room made it's breathing so distinct, so clear... It panted to the point of sounding animalistic, and made it's presence so bold. ______'s (character) own breathing began to pick up, as he retreated to the far corner of his room. There was truly no escape, only avoidance. He felt his heart beat gradually speed up, and sweat beaded down his face. As he caught a glimpse of the things shadow, his pupils grew immensely, wincing at what was about to happen. The- the THING (italics) came around into the room, and then- (dramatic pause) only a scream could be heard.<br>  <br>  Okay, maybe not the best example? Do you still get the feel for what I'm getting at? You never want to make the character's feelings so public, as to say "he/she was scared/frightened". This gives it a mundane feel for the story, causing the reader to lose interest.<br>  <br>  And sometimes, it's not exactly vocabulary that brings the frightening mood. You have to show the actions of the character, like what he/she is doing to represent their fear? Trying to escape, run away, hide? Facial expressions can be very useful as well.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped, and good luck.|`|nCLcdJO0aa	Short sentences e.g<br>  <br>  He stopped. What was that? The strange rustling came again. He was afraid.

Mikey?'<br>  'MIIIIIII-KEEEEEYYYY!' bellows Teri.<br>  I meet her at the foot of the stairs.<br>  The safety gate has been ripped down.<br>  Teri bolts up the stairs, fear trailing her like thunder.<br>  (extract from Catalyst by Laurie Halse Anderson)<br>  I was getting goosebumps as I was writing that!<br>  <br>  Repeating phrases, stalling and not getting to the point is really effective. I was crying at this part of the book:<br>  Mike lies in his room, in his big-boy room. He lies on the bare floor, his fingertips stretched to the snakes in the electrical outlet. His red fire truck, the one with the metal ladder that moves up and down, is blackened. The wall around the electrical outlet is charred. <br>  [...]<br>  Mikey Litch lies on the bare floor of his big-boy room, his eyes open and empty.<br>  (extract from Catalyst by Laurie Halse Anderson)<br>  <br>  Or, you can use a combination of long and short sentences, including a lot of commas in your long sentences.<br>  e.g. She stopped swimming and trod water frantically, mouthing for air. Panic threatened to engulf her. Between the rain and the waves, she could see virtually nothing.<br>  (extract from Fur by Meg Harper)<br>  <br>  Notice her use of vivid vocabulary, like "frantically", "mouthing for air" and "engulf". These kinds of words also help to build suspense.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps - good luck!|`|IKrTilqiaa	Use compound and complex sentences - so there's flow.<br>  <br>  Use commas to create pauses and mimic movements<br>  i.e. " he crept, slowly, under the midnight sky, but then there was a loud bang which frightened him, leaping to the nearest shelter there was"<br>  <br>  that's... a rubbish sentence - but the pauses make the character seem like he's slow, then when something happens - change to complex sentences to create flow.|`|dzfArr3daa	There is a great way to build suspense its simple and effective and only I know how to pull it off however I am preparing to share this wisdom with you.This will make your book at least ten times better.<br>  Alright the secret to creating great suspense for your book is ..Oh no my computer is shutting down!

The attraction is essentially that the story is an impossible fairy tale, and its told in a way that is engaging and puts the reader in Bella's 'ordinary' shoes.  Its a romance, it makes girls feel special.  Its not so much that Edward is rich, impossibly strong and beautiful that makes him so desirable, it is that he sees Bella as the reason to his existence, and they are part of the one whole.  <br>  <br>  I'm ruined for a real-life relationship after reading these types of books.|`|md9rI5Y6aa	the book is ok but its not as good as everyone makes it out to be. it's a vampire romance novel basically.  the main character is too whiny and she's in love with a vampire whom she think is perfect but to be honest he seem more like a controlive boyfriend. the author is too redundant, she uses the same descriptions over and over book after book, like their insn't another way to say he smile my fave crooked smile or his teeth are so white against his crimson skin. i think that the idea for the book was good but the book itself could have been written better.   i read all 4 books in the saga, like i said, they are just ok.|`|YQGbOXhYaa	*eye roll*I'm a girl and I don't like it. I think it's cause there's a lot of romance. It's a bit sickening to me.|`|ZYONnSk9aa	hot guy + great read + love story = great book|`|pfskEpGhaa	I was exactly like you with the book when a few girls were all reading it and recommending it to me. I only started reading it in the christmas holidays recently and they are seriously amazing!<br>  I'm hooked!<br>  <br>  It's about a girl named Bella who moves to Forks where her father lives and gets attracted to Edward who has 4 brothers and sisters who are all adopted into this family who the father is Dr Cullen. After picking up clues from different sources and also becoming friends with Edward she finds out he is a vampire and so are his family and she gets involved because she realizes she can't live without Edward and he can't live without her. <br>  <br>  Everything that comes out of his mouth is just amazing! Edward is the only reason why the books are awesome!<br>  If you like romance and suspense I reckon you should read it! All four books are amazing :)|`|vBduTWF2aa	Not a lot. It's just another crazy fad that everyone follows because everyone else is reading it. It has nothing to do with the fact that it includes vampires, vampire books have been out for centuries. Just to make it clear for Twilight fans - Stephanie Meyer did NOT invent the vampire. <br>  <br>   It's not like it's a great book -- it is poorly developed, Bella and Edward are bad examples of characterization, the vampires are sparkly, and it lacks a true plot. It will fade away soon for another new phase (and I'll be waiting for that day). <br>  <br>  Girls typically like it because Edward (the character in the book) is displayed as perfect and godly, and the girls see themselves as the main character (Bella, who is in love with Edward) because she's "ordinary" (and a Mary-Sue). It's the romance aspects.|`|THMXFYVAaa	Straight up, the REAL reason that everyone at your school loves the books so much is because they are just that good. The main character is very easy to relate to, her love interest is,well, interesting, and Stephenie Meyer just has the whole 'conflict and resolution' thing down pat. It's entertaining, very well-paced. They are incredibly easy to read, even for people who don't like reading. One of my favorite series. <br>  <br>  Please, please don't listen to people who drone on about stereotype-characters and poorly-developed plot lines. These people either 1) Wanted to dislike it before they read it and only did so to find flaws, or 2) They are emotionally detached and/or are the type who rate extreme intellect over being a real live person. <br>  <br>  It's about a girl who moves to a small town to live with her father, with whom she is not very close, and she meets a family of vampires. She falls in love with one of them, and he falls in love right back - the only problem is that they are 'vegetarian' vampires (they don't drink human blood) and she smells more tempting than anything he's ever encountered before. It's all about overcoming the trials of their relationship and what it's like to be a human involved in the world of immortals. Later in the series things get crazy as her best friend falls in love with her, and it turns out he's actually... well, I don't want to spoil it for you, in case you decide to read them.  <br>  <br>  And as for anyone who calls them porn, let me say, as someone who DOES read sexually explicit paranormal romance, this couldn't be more wrong. Edward, the male lead, will hardly even kiss Bella, because he's afraid of losing control of his bloodlust and biting her. And he sticks to his rules, much to the frustration of Bella and every girl who reads these books. There's a reason these books were published as Young Adult.|`|skwfCkokaa	Its so addictive once you get into it, its your ideal life, to have a guy thats absulutley crazy about you, and its well written.
btIvC1esaa	hello
shVgCizBaa	You will get all informations using this link .Life was horrible there I saw a movie All Quiet on the Western Front <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trench_warfare" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trench_warf...</a>       Life in the trenches  An individual unit's time in the front-line trench was usually brief; from as little as one day to as much as two weeks at a time before being relieved. The Australian 31st Battalion once spent 53 days in the line at Villers Bretonneux, but such a duration was a rare exception. The 10th Battalion, CEF, averaged front line tours of six days in 1915 and 1916.[5]<br>  <br>  On an individual level, a typical British soldier's year could be divided as follows:<br>  <br>  15% front line <br>  10% support line <br>  30% reserve line <br>  20% rest <br>  25% other (hospital, travelling, leave, training courses, etc.) <br>  Even when in the front line, the typical battalion would only be called upon to engage in fighting a handful of times a year—making an attack, defending against an attack or participating in a raid. The frequency of combat would increase for the units of the "elite" fighting divisions—on the Allied side; the British regular divisions, the Canadian Corps, the French XX Corps and the Anzacs.<br>  <br>   .Some sectors of the front saw little activity throughout the war, making life in the trenches comparatively easy. When the I Anzac Corps first arrived in France in April 1916 after the evacuation of Gallipoli, they were sent to a relatively peaceful sector south of Armentières to "acclimatise". Other sectors were in a perpetual state of violent activity. On the Western Front, Ypres was invariably hellish, especially for the British in the exposed, overlooked salient. However, quiet sectors still amassed daily casualties through sniper fire, artillery, disease, and poison gas. In the first six months of 1916, before the launch of the Somme Offensive, the British did not engage in any significant battles on their sector of the Western Front and yet suffered 107,776 casualties. About 1 in 8 men would return alive and wound free from the trenches.<br>  <br>  A sector of the front would be allocated to an army corps, usually comprising three divisions. Of these two divisions would occupy adjacent sections of the front and the third would be in rest to the rear. This breakdown of duty would continue down through the army structure, so that within each front-line division, typically comprising three infantry brigades (regiments for the Germans), two brigades would occupy the front and the third would be in reserve. Within each front-line brigade, typically comprising four battalions, two battalions would occupy the front with two in reserve. And so on for companies and platoons. The lower down the structure this division of duty proceeded, the more frequently the units would rotate from front-line duty to support or reserve.<br>   During the day, snipers and artillery observers in balloons made movement perilous, so the trenches were mostly quiet. Consequently, the trenches were busiest at night, when cover of darkness allowed the movement of troops and supplies, the maintenance and expansion of the barbed wire and trench system, and reconnaissance of the enemy's defenses. Sentries in listening posts out in no man's land would try to detect enemy patrols and working parties or indications that an attack was being prepared.<br>  <br>  Pioneered by the PPCLI in February 1915,[6] trench raids were carried out in order to capture prisoners and "booty"—letters and other documents to provide intelligence about the unit occupying the opposing trenches. As the war progressed, raiding became part of the general British policy, the intention being to maintain the fighting spirit of the troops and to deny no man's land to the Germans. As well, they were intended to force the enemy to reinforce, which exposed his troops to artillery fire.[7] Such dominance was achieved at a high cost, when the enemy replied with his own artillery,[8] and a post-war British analysis concluded the benefits were probably not worth the cost. Early in the war, surprise raids would be mounted, particularly by the Canadians, but increased vigilance made achieving surprise difficult as the war progressed. By 1916, raids were carefully planned exercises in combined arms and involved close co-operation of infantry and artillery. A raid would begin with an intense artillery bombardment designed to drive off or kill the front-trench garrison and cut the barbed wire. Then the bombardment would shift to form a "box", or cordon, around a section of the front line to prevent a counter-attack intercepting the raid. However, the bombardment also had the effect of notifying the enemy of the location of the planned attack, thus allowing reinforcements to be called in from wider sectors|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	I suggest you search WWI because that was almost total trench warfare.  In fact, I found this site through google.

A remarkable book. Imagine what it must have been like. You are in a muddy hole. If you stick your head up, someone will shoot at you. Some of your buddies have been killed. It is cold. If you try to get away, the officers in your own army will shoot you. It is a very unpleasant predicament. Really try to empathize with this situation, and try to be really honest about what it was really like, and then write that. It will be a compelling story. <br>  <br>  By the way, if you study advanced economics you will encounter a whole school of thought called "game theory." This is the study of how opposing entities interact in a zero sum game. Well, digging two troughs across a field from each other and trying to shoot each other is the ultimate zero sum game. What actually happened in this situation in World War One is the two armies learned ways to accomodate each other. For example, they would develop an unspoken "agreement" to not shoot each other during dinner. If some sniper shot a guy during one of these unspoken truces, the other side could expect one of their guys to be likewise shot, in order to re-establish the unspoken "truce."|`|8309f9cbff94401c9a0602e4bbb11f22aa	Life in the trenches was tough but fun at times, we just had water and nutrition bars.

vYNOotEMaa	Do you mean refugees?<br>  It all depended upon where the refugees were, and whether they had a home to return to.<br>  <br>  There were many "unwelcomed" people who were expelled, or exterminated by both Russians and German governments, as you probably know.<br>  <br>  See my reference below for more information.<br>  <br>  Jewish refugees, for example, stayed in camps for years.  They did not really want to returned to Poland, Germany or Russia, so many went to their soon to be new State of Israel. (recognized by UN in 1948)<br>  <br>  By 1948, most refugees (or evacuees) had decided to settle upon a place to restart their life. <br>  <br>  Many with skills ended up in the USA, we took many German scientists and settled them here, for example. <br>   Many fascists left Europe for Argentina, or other places in South America.<br>  <br>  The Truman's Marshall Plan  speeded up rebuilding Europe, so they could feed, house, and provide employment to the general population.<br>  <br>  In general, returning refugees were not welcomed, because they took limited food and jobs of the local community that had not fled, who had not been expelled.  <br>  Jewish refugees, were not welcomed in Israel by the Palestinians. (Mostly Moslems).  Which still is a big reason for current hostilities in that region.<br>  <br>  This is copied from my source:<br>  >>The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration was set up in 1943, to provide humanitarian relief to the vast numbers of potential and existing refugees in areas facing Allied liberation. UNRRA provided billions of US dollars of rehabilitation aid, and helped about 8 million refugees.<br>   It ceased operations in Europe in 1947, and in Asia in 1949, upon which it ceased to exist. It was replaced in 1947 by the International Refugee Organization (IRO), which in turn evolved into United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in 1950.<br>  <<|`|i5FP4Vbraa	You can find out a lot about the evauees at these next BBC website links.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2children/letters/letters_intro.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2children...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/britain_wwtwo/evacuees_01.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/bri...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/437827.stm" rel="nofollow">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/437827.stm</a><br>  <br>  Evacuees leave Sunderland WW2<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOErhLxx62s" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOErhLxx6...</a><br>  <br>  Evacuees return home<br>  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/33/a6402133.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stori...</a><br>  <br>  Legendary News Reporter Ed Morrow reporting live from Tafalgar Square 1940 speaking directly to the American people back home.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpOKriiNIzE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpOKriiNI...</a><br>  <br>  War baby now 68. . . .hmm how time flies.|`|Tqizcvuyaa	march 9 1945, dude tell me if u need any more help!!!!!!

It could almost be a borrowing from Whitman.
zCOvQwQhaa	Those metals are usually a Leblanc.  Fine instruments indeed - in fact, most contra players consider the Leblanc Paris to be the best contras made.<br>  <br>  Technically, and mechanically, you should be able to play an F above the high C above the staff.  Same fingerings as the soprano.<br>  <br>  Practically, why would we?  That's not what this beast is for.  This beast is for playing low.  If you want to play really high clarinet then get an Ab sopranino or an Eb soprano.<br>  <br>  If your contra has a range to low C then there's a neat trick you can do to make it a half-step lower to B as long as you can reach the bell with your foot.  Take off your right shoe and insert your socked heel into the bell while playing C.  Move your foot to adjust for intonation.<br>  <br>  The best sound for that horn is the low register below the break.  That's where you should really concentrate.  Any time you need to play an octave higher, pick up a bass.  ?

If there is an area of a city which suffers from high crime and violence, it is probably down to a build-up of fearful thoughts which then attract the trouble.

A country experiencing an economic downturn will have a population whose main thoughts are focused on lack and shortage.  When these thoughts are replaced by thoughts of plenty and prosperity, the glorious boom times will return.<br>  <br>  If it is a city, you are talking about collective creation at a municipal level.  The city whose inhabitants are thinking of greatness will create a reality where the way of life in that city is truly great.  It will start will small things first, such as the disappearance of litter, and then broaden out to even more significant things as the creative psychic momentum builds.<br>  <br>  Prosperity will return to the city in the form of visitors spending money and grant money.  Businesses will begin to do roaring trade.  Whole areas will be developed to become very pleasant (ie Lincoln Road Mall in Miami).  Companies open up branches and offices there, creating sources of jobs (my home town of Watford now boasts offices of a lot of principal British companies, and stores of most chains).  Undesired residents leave to be replaced by much better people.  Run-down areas become gentrified.  <br>  <br>  Another thing that happens is that transport links are greatly improved.  I personally think that Zaragoza in Spain has such consciousness, and as a result, the high speed RENFE trains between Barcelona and Madrid pass through.<br>  <br>  The city becomes a fun, fashionable and desirable place to live, and lots of other embellishments are then added.  If it has a distinct local culture (such as Cape Town or Barcelona) this attracts outlets for its expression.  Brighton is very much a dynamic, growth UK city and there are plans for about twenty artistic and developmental projects to be undertaken in the city; from the redevelopment of Hove Lagoon or the King Alfred Leisure Centre, to a local airport and more public art throughout the city.<br>  <br>  A lot of growth cities also attract 'events' to put them on the map and further fill their coffers with prosperity.  London has been a buoyant place since the mid-90s, and is now going to host the 2012 Olympics.  The same with Barcelona in 1992 and Sydney in 2000.  Zaragoza has developed immensely over the past decade and was chosen for the Expo World fair of 2008.  Brisbane was a very up-and-coming place in the 1980s, and was awarded the 1982 Commonwealth Games and the 1988 Expo World Fair.<br>  <br>  If the city had a sports team, then they would start to do well.  Watford was rather up-and-coming throughout the boom times of the Major and Blair eras, and our football team was promoted three times between 1998 and 2006.  Barcelona's football team continues to do well, and Seville's two clubs have flourished over the past fifteen years, to trophy-winning extent - coinciding with the 1992 Expo World Fair and subsequent development, arising from prosperity consciousness of Sevillanos.<br>  <br>  So if people in a city believed that their's was a great place to be and live, their city would then attract everything needed for it to be such a destination.|`|XvO4iLk0aa	G Belief is just one aspect of what it takes to change.<br>  Read the LDK.<br>  Life Decryption Key-Shortest<br>  By Generalist 02-09<br>  <br>   Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.<br>  The first decision is; do we want to control our lives, or rely on outside forces. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects.<br>  <br>  This document is intended for those who want to control their lives and accept that causes produce effects. The question naturally occurs, “What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?” The causes must be based on what is pragmatically verifiable, yet universally true. <br>  <br>  Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the Japanese words Myoho.  Why use Japanese words? The concept originated in Japan and can’t be expressed as well in another language.<br>  <br>  Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.<br>  <br>  Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is. <br>  <br>  The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life. <br>  <br>  This formulation serves as a life decryption key.<br>  Add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This, spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together, focuses the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy. It works best when conducted together with other people, who are also trying to have great lives by training their mind-heart-bodies by using the LDK. <br>  <br>  Source:<br>  <a href="http://www.sgi-usa.org." rel="nofollow">http://www.sgi-usa.org.</a> Or<br>  <a href="http://www.SGI.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.SGI.org</a> <br>   Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key.

This is only natural for us humans to take pride in, and feel better about things, people, and places we belong. There however is limit to everything, as nothing in the world can be perfect in comparison, no place can be without its good and bad, and nowhere in the human collect is beyond its need for self-examination, and thereupon need for constant improvement. <br>  <br>  Then if there somehow is somewhere ideal, where people have managed to convince themselves that they have reached a stage where they are no comparison for anywhere else, then the danger would loom, and it is most likely that the place will eventually face its own demise, as there then will be not room for improvement of change. People then would do whatever they would like imagining themselves to be right and beyond any need for external reference. This then would be the case where people would stop believing in things greater than themselves and the search for truth will come to a standstill, some that is normally impossible the mind. Human history is full of instance where cities, civilisations and culture cut off from the rest of the world, deprived of their sense of self-doubt and therefore of their climate of opinion and debate, fell into sharp decline leave behind legacies of their fall. <br>  <br>  In short, this is important for individual minds as well as for the collective to accommodate doubt, to question, and therefore constantly seek better answers, and finer solutions to the problems common to human condition. It is possible for individuals to get away for certain length of time with their erroneous self-beliefs, time can forgive them, but time never forgive the collective, when people in their numbers go mad they simple blind themselves, leaving for themselves exposed to upheavals and catastrophic happening of nature to cause change.|`|cPlsi257aa	Not sure. Such a belief can lead to anything from motivation and impetus to decadence and decay. The belief in ones greatness can be self affirming and inspire, but it can also lead to complacence and self deciet. Look at Rome for example: Great city, and argueably a great people, but they became careless. Hubris and all....<br>  I guess it depends on the nature of the people and the state of the world around. Maybe in the case of the Romans them being already great and having no-one who could dispute their greatness with impunity made them too confident. Could be that greatness only works when there are people willing to dispute it.<br>  Just a thought....|`|QlXhPFSwaa	well their city would be great of course. the power of the mind has been explained in the book "the secret". and i know for a fact that anyone can do anything once they put their minds into it. coz life is what you make of it and it starts with your believing you can make it happen in my case im too lazy and you can say im wasting my mind and in essence my life but oh well.<br>  <br>  edit: i disagree with the disagreement of the answerer below me. if you put your mind into it you will do anything in your power to accomplish it. of course it will not be easy, people go so far as to even kill just to make it happen but they will accomplish their goal coz they will it to happen no matter the obstacles. they made up their mind on how to accomplish the goal.|`|02JUswskaa	They will achieve much more than they would have done without their belief. <br>  <br>  Surely history must be littered with such events.<br>  <br>  I believe the collective consciousness and persons tapping into it unwittingly lies at the very heart of human development and expansion. <br>  <br>  A motivated population are capable of anything. <br>  <br>  Consider armies and sports teams.<br>  <br>  Very good question.|`|y8bFwXZEaa	The creation would already have begun--a sense of self-worth, perhaps because industry was flocking there; or maybe like Colorado the baseball teams that practice there in the winter now equal those that practice in Florida.<br>  <br>  If you mean a city FOR NO REASON gets a "big head" and starts to think they are "holier" or "more virtuous" or simply a better place to live, then your question can't be answered because there is NO REASON for their attitute.<br>  <br>  But if there is a reason, it already began.|`|gLp7pvPnaa	The awareness of greatness would be infectious, then if applied by many minds would result in greater achievements.

E8XwIFPlaa	To be honest, it does sound too gloomy, as if you are apologizing for a huge mistake that you made that drastically affected her life. The flow of it is a bit nice, in a way, but the lack of substance clouds that and it's hard to look past. You have some good lines (my regret ricochets/disappointment my siren song) but the poem is very fragmented and not cohesive, the stanzas in general don't make sense.<br>  <br>  My advice:<br>  - Make the rhyme scheme unified; don't make all the lines rhyme in one stanza, while the other stanzas have pairs of lines that rhyme (you did that with the first stanza)<br>  <br>  - Your second stanza, in my opinion, was the best one. I'd reword the second line of it (it doesn't really make sense) and make that the beginning of the poem.<br>  <br>  - If you're purposely trying  to be melodramatic about not being able to make it to the party, then saying "I'm dead inside" and similar is fine. If not, then I'd drop them. <br>  <br>  - The last stanza makes the least amount of sense, I don't know what you are talking about. What is she "looking upon in awe" and how is that related to your apology?<br>  <br>  - Focus on the apology, how much you regret not being able to attend, how you hope she'll understand, how you wish you could be there, how you want her to accept this poem as an apology. Read your poem over again and try to rearrange some verses and add others. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|bHI4NLonaa	It is a little dark for a birthday present. Is your friend Emo or Goth?

KHSOVxViaa	The French colony of Vietnam was invaded and occupied by the Japanese in WW II. A local Vietnamese nationalist leader, Ho Chi Minh, fought the new occupiers and was given support by the Allies. He had considerable success in this, perfecting the art of guerilla warfare, and became a national hero.  After the war the French returned to reclaim their colony, opposed by Ho Chi Minh who wanted Vietnam to be independent. He sought help from the USA, but was rebuffed.  He then turned to communist China, and later the USSR for support and began a campaign against the French.<br>  <br>  His 'Viet Minh' forces steadily took over most of the north, and he defeated France in a big battle at Dien Bien Phu. France agreed to negotiate, which resulted in the Geneva Accords of 1954. Under its terms, France would withdraw form the north and Vietnam would be temporarily divided in two at a ceasefire line (later DMZ). The country was to be reunified in 1956 following elections.<br>  <br>  Ho Chi Minh's government controlled the north, and a new government by Bao Dai was formed at Saigon in the south. However, Bao Dai was quickly overthrown by his prime minister Diem, who refused to recognise the validity of the Geneva accords, would not have the agreed elections, and blocked all moves towards reunification of the country.  He had support of the USA because of his anti-communist stance, and the USA feared the 'domino' theory, where one state 'toppling' to communism would cause its neighbours to also do so.  This was the height of the Cold War.<br>  <br>  Many people in the South were unhappy with this continued separation, and they formed a guerilla army to fight Diem's regime. This was backed by the North, and became the National Liberation Front (NLF, nicknamed 'Vietcong'). They increased their activities, targetting local government officials, and Diem's government struggled to resist them.<br>  <br>  The USA sent in advisors to help the Diem government, replacing the withdrawn French.  However, Diem's government was corrupt and inefficient, and his army (ARVN) was led by generals who were loyal to him but incompetent.  The NLF made gains, sometimes beating back a much larger ARVN force, so US forces began combat operations to try to make a difference.<br>  <br>  Diem's regime was becoming increasingly autocratic and unpopular, and the majority Buddhist population was being oppressed.  This led to civil unrest and rebellions, brutally put down.  It also led to ever-increasing support for the NLF.  Diem seemed more concerned with avoiding coups and staying in power than winning the war against the NLF.  The CIA assisted a coup against Diem, which resulted in his assassination in 1963.  However, he was replaced by a series of military governments which were even more unpopular.<br>  <br>  After a perceived clash with North Vietnamese forces (Tonkin Incident), US operations began against North Vietnam. The war escalated dramatically, and major operations were occurring regularly.  By 1968 US forces were doing the bulk of the fighting against the NLF and North.|`|Y1iYQJvWaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War</a>|`|07WvplYKaa	Dear Questioner<br>  <br>  Vietnam was formerly known as French Indo China.<br>  In the early 1950's the French were attacked by Communist forces and finally defeated at Dien Bien Phu.

Vietnam, the country on whose land this terrible war has taken place has suffered great damage to its ecosystem and it has taken years and years for it to re-grow. People have died, families have been hurt and no one was left happy with the after effects of this war.<br>  Facts of the Vietnam War<br>  In the year 1954, Vietnam was split into two separate parts: the communist north and the democratic south. Thereafter, a series of events took place that led up to a full-fledged war between these two countries and the war did not only include the Vietnamese, it also included the Americans, Australians and a few other nations.<br>  <br>  The Americans and other nations supported the largely unpopular southern democrats, and although initially they meant to keep their involvement very limited, they ended up sending millions and millions of soldiers to Vietnam to prevent communism from spreading. Years and years of bitter guerrilla struggle in the typhoid ridden villages and rugged jungles of Vietnam eventually led to the victory of the North Vietnamese and the reunification of the country. Millions of soldiers, Vietnamese and Americans alike died in the struggle, and till today the country struggles to reinstate itself after the staggering damages made to its land, economy and people.<br>  <br>  The Beginning of the End<br>  When Ngo Dinh Diem was appointed to be the prime minister, with Bao Dai the then president, Vietnam was split into two separate countries: North Vietnam and South Vietnam. During this separation, more than 860 thousand people fled to the South and more than 50 thousand left for the north.<br>  <br>  The northern government however, welcomed this change, as it meant feeding fewer mouths. It is said the Diem rigged the election so as to win, and then became the president of Vietnam. Although he wasn’t particularly popular with his people, the United States still agreed with his policies and completely supported him, as he was against communism.<br>  <br>  However, the South Vietnamese despised Diem. Diem on the other hand, abused his power and sent people to kill his enemies while sending still others to jail for no apparent reason. Diem who believed that South Vietnamese people were influenced by communism canceled the election that was scheduled to take place in 1956.<br>  <br>  It was then that United States stopped supporting Diem because they no longer agreed with any of his principles and policies. He forced peasants out of their villages and the final straw came when on May 8th, 1963 he sent soldiers to storm Buddhist temples and arrest the nuns and monks. In order to protest this, a Buddhist monk, Thich Quang Duc burnt himself alive in the streets. There were many other protest being led by the Vietnamese, but in other different ways. The northern government wanted to bring about peace and harmony, but this proposal was refused.<br>  <br>  Finally the Southerners couldn’t take it anymore and Diem was assassinated on the 1st of May in 1963. South Vietnam celebrated this victory and the country was reunited.<br>  <br>  How the Americans got Involved<br>  Johnson was the central figure when it comes to the US involvement in Vietnam. His vision was to stop the spread of communist aggression, and others shared this theory like Eisenhower, Kennedy and Truman. In the year 1964, the Northern Vietnamese apparently attacked two US destroyers. Thus, in the year 1965, the US began regularly bombing the Northern railroads, bridges and oil facilities as well as the HaiPhong harbor.<br>  <br>  With the Vietcong attack of an US base in Pleiku, the Americans were now fully involved and Operation Flaming dart came next. In April of the year 1965, Johnson was all set to Americanize this Vietnam War and sent more than 40 thousand troops to Vietnam.<br>  <br>  By mid June, Johnson was told to send in more troops in order to prevent South Vietnam’s collapse. Thus America had to plunge directly into the war, which was a better option at that time than facing defeat.<br>  <br>  Facts of the Vietnam War<br>  While most aspects of the Vietnam war are really debatable, the facts of this war have a strong voice of their own and are indeed indisputable. Here are some of the commonly accepted facts of the war:<br>  <br>  * About 58,200 Americans were killed during the war and roughly 304,000 were wounded out of the 2.59 million who served the war.<br>  * The average age of the wounded and dead was 23.11 years.<br>  * After the war, Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and The Philippines stayed free of communism.<br>  * During the war, the national debt was increased by $146 billion.<br>  * 90% of the Vietnam War veterans say they are glad they served in the war.<br>  * 74% say they would serve again.<br>  * 11,465 were less than the age of 20.<br>  * The number of Vietnamese killed was 500,000 and casualties were in the millions.<br>  * From the year 1957 to the year 1973, the National Liberation Front assassinated n

f4Nn0W1xaa	To a certain extent Transcendentalism and Naturalism do contradict one another. Life is full of contradictions though, and since Steinbeck is a genius at capturing the nuances of life and reality it makes sense that he would be able to use that contradiction to strengthen his stories rather than to muddy the waters.<br>  <br>  In Grapes I think it could be said that his characters express the Transcendental aspects while the novel, as a whole, is a Naturalist work. That melding is what makes it so true and timeless a work.

Sheep in particular were very important in medieval times as they provided meat for food, milk to make cheese, wool for clothing, and their skin could be used to make parchment, which books were written on.  Horses pulled ploughs, and of course were also used for transport.<br>  <br>  Hunting was very important in medieval times, not just for sport but as a source of food, and good hunting dogs would be valued.  Falconry was very popular too, and a favourite bird would often share his master's bedroom and accompany him daily on his wrist.  Ladies often kept small pet dogs as pets.<br>  <br>  Bloodthirsty sports like bear-baiting and cock-fighting were popular throughout the medieval and early modern periods.  Indeed, cock-fighting was still popular in the 19th century, Mark Twain's book 'Life on the Mississippi contains a vivid descroption of a cock-fight.|`|d04ae6ff8e12fe20d1db30d24b4bc806aa	People's attitudes towards animals was based on the biblical teachings in the book of Genesis.<br>  <br>  According to Genesis, God created the animals and "gave man dominion over them."<br>  <br>  This means that animals had no other purpose than what people wanted of them. They were useful for work, food and/or clothing. They served no other purpose. They were possessions only; and their function was to be of service in whatever capacity people wanted or needed.|`|cc7a9e602a34331d1b8fc3083e410395aa	What kind of animals - all in general - or household pets, wildlife etc!

iNXqiDIYaa	a period of over 700 years when various religious groups peacefully co-existed has to be classed as one of the greatest successes of all times<br>  <br>  La Convivencia ("the Coexistence") is a term used to describe the situation in Spanish history from about 711 to 1492 – concurrent with the Reconquista ("Reconquest") – when Jews, Muslims, and Catholics in Spain lived in relative peace together within the different kingdoms (during the same time, however, the Christian push to the south into Moorish land was ongoing). The phrase often refers to the interplay of cultural ideas between the three groups, and ideas of religious tolerance.<br>  <br>  The reason for that success was that everyone was allowed to have their own religious views and customs and nobody tried to force their views on anybody else<br>  <br>  What a great pity that in todays society we seem unable to copy these great spainiards of the past and that there is such a lot of intolerance around.

vkzkXWfzaa	The curve on all the lenses has to be so much more accurate than on smaller diameters, an error of 0.0001mm would be invisible in a smaller diameter lens it would look like the bottom of a milk bottle on a large lens, as any lens has some irregularities and are never quite perfect they have to individually matched then assemble all the elements into a lens by hand, checking and testing as they go, in other words they are a lot more difficult to make, but you are assured of a near perfect lens.<br>  <br>  The extra costs for glass etc. are small by comparison.<br>  <br>  ChrisJ|`|oXPDFw4daa	Several factors contribute to the cost of a lens:<br>  <br>  1.  A maximum aperture of 2.8 compared with 4.5 means that the diameter of the glass elements in the lens will be greater.  Greater diameter also means greater thickness (the curvature of the surface determines the optical performance), and greater weight.<br>  <br>  2.  Greater weight means that the mechanical elements of the lens will have to be more rugged compared to a 4.5.<br>  <br>  3.  Assuming that the price will be greater, purchasers will expect enhanced optical performance over and above the simple factor of light-gathering ability.  That implies more engineering, greater precision in manufacturing, and potentially more expensive materials.<br>  <br>  4.  The price you pay and the cost that the manufacturer incurs in making the lens are only indirectly related.  The manufacturer recognizes that a heavier, higher-priced lens will find a smaller market, and therefore has to spread his base costs across an anticipated smaller number of sales.  That tends to drive up price.  <br>  <br>  5.  Finally, as the lens becomes 'faster', it becomes more of a specialty item, and those who truly need it are going to be willing to spend more for it that would someone who simply want the latest gadget.  The fact that the smaller market is willing to pay more means that the manufacturer will charge more.|`|31420ed41c716cbb02addca8d450fc2eaa	Two reasons:<br>  <br>  1.  The market seems to want the faster lenses, so the faster they are, the more you CAN charge.<br>  <br>  2.  If you know how f stops are figured, you will quickly find out that in order to get a faster lens, the configuration of elements has to far more sophisticated than in even a stop or so slower.|`|1wzSq4OJaa	A clear understanding of f-stops in relation to shooting conditions will answer this question for you.<br>  <br>  1.  The lower your f-stop the lower the lighting situation you will be able to handle.  A lens that can go to 2.8 will do much better than a 4.5.  A lens that goes to 1.4 will be even better than a 2.8 and so on.  Shooting a 2.8 lens means you can keep your ISO lower than with a 4.5 so you don't introduce as much noise into your images.<br>  <br>  2.  The term "Fast Glass" or "Fast Lens" is thrown around, but some people who read these terms don't understand them.  Fast is speaking in relation to the amount of time it takes to capture a well exposed image.  With an f-stop of 2.8 you take less time to capture an image than you do with a 4.5 lens, there by making the 2.8 lens a faster lens.<br>  <br>  You are paying for the speed of the glass as well as handling shots better in lower light.  Faster glass and better noise control are HUGE in the world of photography.  Getting better and better or even the best costs more.|`|cBNjgxW9aa	To answer your question directly, better performance in low light conditions is acheived by improving light gathering, which means larger lens elements.  The larger the lens elements, the less forgiving the manufacturing tolerances are, and the more costly the manufacturing process.|`|65109cb8f29d34e3d6fc411bd1edae58aa	There is physically more material in a comparable f/2.8 lens, it is substantially more difficult to create a sharp image at f/2.8, the construction tends to be more robust and many f/2.8 lenses are hand finished. <br>  <br>  f/2.8 lenses, especially big telephotos, are individually tested by a human. Less expensive lenses are random sampled and machine tested.

You just have to spend your time appreciating them more.|`|AA10729675	It is so true.  When such emotion before beauty overcomes us, then we feel emptiness inside us, because we anticipate the separation from that beauty.  It is the constant shift pleasure/pain all the time.  In our life, if we could pass the hurdle of this constant shift, we would not suffer any more.  But there is dualism.  And while we contemplate beauty as if we were part of it, somewhere inside us, we know that we are two entities and this separation causes the feeling of emptiness and pain.  That is life.

ceBTTCPwaa	"The Eve of St. Agnes" is a long poem (42 stanzas) by John Keats, written in 1819 and published in 1820. It is widely considered to be amongst his finest poems and was influential in 19th century literature.<br>  <br>  The title comes from the day (or evening) before the feast of Saint Agnes (or St. Agnes' Eve). St. Agnes, the patron saint of virgins, died a martyr in fourth century Rome. The eve falls on January 20; the feast day on the 21. The divinations referred to by Keats in this poem are referred to by John Aubrey in his Miscellanies (1696) as being associated with St. Agnes' night.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve_of_St._Agnes" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eve_of_St._...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/prb/ringel12.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/prb...</a> : The Theme of "The Eve of St. Agnes" in the Pre-Raphaelite Movement, An analysis of the poem at Victorianweb <br>  <br>  <a href="http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/cs6/st_agnes.html" rel="nofollow">http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/englis...</a> : CUNY Brooklyn page on the Eve of St Agnes
spYpsixUaa	Quite simply, because one of the definitions of falseness is "That which is not the case."  Wittgenstein's intent in the Tractatus was to develop a system of Logic which would apply to practical reality, not theoretical notions or abstractions.  He tried to narrow its scope so tightly that only the things which made sense and were observable true facts would be represented by it.  Everything else was to be relegated to a reality which was simply not related to the Logical system defined by the Tractatus.<br>  <br>  An example of this is the arrangement of Mechanical books for cars. They have a separate section for Body Parts and Electrical Systems, Fuel Systems and Suspension.  There are things in cars which belong to more than one section at a time, and are even interrelated in both places, but to keep the book from being thousands of pages longer and unsearchable and inconsistently untrustworthy, the redundancies have to be excluded.<br>  <br>  The Tractatus is a system which purported to be the first section of such a complex system.  Frustratingly for the rest of the world, Wittgenstein spent the rest of his life trying to reconfigure that one piece of his philosophy instead of moving on to the other parts.<br>  <br>  [Added Later:  "Part of the world" is not necessarily "the case," according to the Tractatus.  It's like saying within the universe of data (in this database).  "The world" of the Tractatus is only the elements of Reality which meet its rules.]|`|0fygxRHLaa	hehe where did you find that avatar?|`|y8bFwXZEaa	"Wittgenstein was concerned not with what we can or cannot do, but with what makes sense....The nonsensical utterance "laubgefraub" is not to be contradicted by saying, "No, it is not the case that laubgefraub," or "Laubgefraub is a logical impossibility." <a href="http://www.iep.utm.edu/w/wittgens.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.iep.utm.edu/w/wittgens.htm</a><br>  <br>  Since your square root example is "nonsensical utterance," it stands to reason he was not concerned with it. <br>  <br>  To say the world is all that is the "case," he meant by "case" only what has truth within its reality. Certainly your statement is "part of the world," but since it contains no truth, it is not "the case." Only the truth is the "case," and all else is "not the case."|`|fbolP31Gaa	I think Wittgenstein would say that such statements are categorically *not* the case. That you said that "The square root of 2 is the ratio of two integers" is the case, and that you said it is part of the world. But the statement itself is simply not part of the world.

We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.<br>  The first decision is; do we want to control our lives, or rely on outside forces.

The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the Japanese words Myoho.  Why use Japanese words? The concept originated in Japan and can’t be expressed as well in another language.<br>  <br>  Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.<br>  <br>  Everything is always changing.

gGZz2EGyaa	When World War I broke out in 1914, Mussolini agreed with the other Socialists that Italy should not join it. Only a class war was acceptable to him, and he threatened to lead a proletarian revolution if the government decided to fight. But several months later he unexpectedly changed his position on the war, leaving the Socialist party and his editorial chair.<br>  In November 1914 he founded a new paper, Il Popolo d'Italia, and the prowar group Fasci d'Azione Rivoluzionaria. He evidently hoped the war might lead to a collapse of society that would bring him to power. Called up for military service, he was wounded in grenade practice in 1917 and returned to edit his paper.<br>  Fascism became an organized political movement in March 1919 when Mussolini founded the Fasci de Combattimento. After failing in the 1919 elections, Mussolini at last entered parliament in 1921 as a right-wing member. The Fascisti formed armed squads to terrorize Mussolini's former Socialist colleagues. The government seldom interfered. In return for the support of a group of industrialists and agrarians, Mussolini gave his approval to strikebreaking, and he abandoned revolutionary agitation. When the liberal governments of Giovanni Giolitti, Ivanoe Bonomi, and Luigi Facta failed to stop the spread of anarchy, Mussolini was invited by the king in October 1922 to form a government. <br>  <br>  This is part of the bio on Mussonlini that I came across, I have put the web site with all details below.

4ieW81HHaa	That's more than prose. That's poetry.<br>  <br>  I'm confused as to what "or be it that / from whence this blessed gift had come, choose to remain." means, though. And the shift from past to present tense in the middle of a sentence in line 7 was awkward (maybe make the shift at "Nursing hands [wash] away the blood, and [cleanse]"), but the overall content, and the use of simple diction to describe such a not-so-very-simple event was brilliant in my opinion.

9b355e061fa6c3b030996f1809e2369aaa	Books in the series are : <br>  1.  Secret Vampire<br>  2.  Daughters of Darkness<br>  3.  Spellbinder<br>  4.  Dark Angel<br>  5.  The Chosen<br>  6.  Soulmate<br>  7.  Huntress<br>  8.  Black Dawn<br>  9.  Witchlight<br>  10.Strange Fate<br>  <br>  The series is categorized as "young-adult fiction" so if you call yourself a teen its OK for you to read the series.<br>  <br>  Its again a series involving Vampires, Witches, Werewolves, Shapeshifters/Dragons, Old Souls etc.<br>  So you love such kind of fantasy its for you.<br>  <br>  Like in most of Smith's works, the main protagonist in each volume of the Night World series is a female teenager. The novels do not follow the same characters. Instead, each novel is a separate story about different characters who live in this same world and at a time when forces known to witches as the "old powers" begin to bring some Night People to find their soul mates in humans.
fCvc1LLEaa	Ewww, no. I want to punch your first character. He's such a cliche character.|`|aBDr4XIIaa	The first one sounds like a stereotyped emo kid. How does he act older than he is when you describe him as being a tough little teenage guy who doesn't listen to anyone but himself? That's contradicting. Winter sounds abit more engaging but is still a little cliche. Don't worry too much, about all of this though--characterize not only through back story, but with the choices that each of them make. A way to get the reader to know your characters and feel for them, is to show them the protagonist's thoughts, not tell them to them. You have good clay here, just start making a sculpture. The characters have to go on an inner journey and that is where much of your characterization will shine through.|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	Yeah, they're engaging, but Mordred is a typical emo kid. Maybe you want to make sure he doesn't get too predictable. Other than that, interesting characters, Winter is very good! =D|`|MW6WOTDIaa	Mordred seems like your typical emo kid to me. what type of book are you writing? <br>  <br>  Winter is actually a very interesting character. it'll be interesting to write for someone with that description.|`|QW4jdXGjaa	Mordred is a bit cliche, but still interesting. Winter is a much more different character, and I'd really want to read about her. So yes, they are very engaging.|`|M2XQMPNNaa	Without more to make Mordred interesting, he seems stereotyped and frankly, obnoxious. If there were more detail that gave insight into more depth of character-either good or bad, he just sounds obnoxious and the bit of story line you revealed seems a little melodramatic.<br>  I found Winter to be much more interesting. I found myself wanting to know a little more about her and her struggles and even curious for examples of her humor, ie: "being funny without meaning to be" leaves the door open for an amusing, engaging story. Hope this helps!|`|xSvZW32xaa	Your characters seem cliche.|`|bzt6WmBUaa	Wow - these character's sound amazing, they seem really life like and i feel as if i already know them! you're an amazing writer by the sounds of it. Now you've got the characters you need a setting and a plot. Maybe they could meet up and eventually fall in love, with a slight twist...<br>  Anyhow this isn't my book it's yours, so good luck in the future i know you'll be fantastic and suceed in whatever you do, P.S - when you get this book published i'm first in the que, i can tell it's gonna be a winner<br>  Hope i've helped, best wishes and good luck (again) lot's of love and support - Rachael x

However the French army did participate in the battle of the Somme in the Southern part of the battlefront.  They were much more successful than their British allies and used tactics more suited to the terrain by attacks which probed the German defences for weak spots which were then assaulted more strongly.|`|9eQXZTLUaa	They did.  There were nearly 200,000 French casualties on the Somme.|`|AA11304025	They did fight. They were on the right flank|`|NJ3QJD4eaa	They did
z4Yeofq8aa	Why blame- in the long term it was a strategic victory for the allies. When the battle finally ended in November the Germans had suffered more casualties than the British and French. Haig had limited choices in July 1916. He had an obligation to take pressure off the French at Verdun so he was forced to launch an offensive in order to draw German reinforcements onto the Somme front. In spite of the disaster of the first day it became a battle of attrition and that suited the British and French more than the Germans who were less able to sustain the losses. Also during the 4 months of the battle the British honed their tactics especially regarding the use of tanks, and learned the lessons that would bring them success throughout the rest of the war.

AA11142708	The meaning of life changes as you get older. I'm answering your question because of the parts-- thanks for the question. To seek the meaning of life is the meaning of life. We must be alive to do so (and we must "love" to do so). The freedom to be alive comes before life itself, so the existence of the possibility for life is the answer to "why life arose". In other words, to seek the meaning of life is to be free to seek the meaning of life and this freedom is the product of the evolution of the star stuff that came together to create the conditions for life to survive and evolve. Why do we need to know all this? Great question! <br>  <br>  We seek knowledge because we are on a journey--a homecoming journey of sorts. Most of us know our birthplace, but that’s not good enough—a more universal homecoming is what's called for, -- which is one reason why there is religion(s)!  But, I’m not talking about religion that uses scripture for justification. Language cannot describe what I mean by “homecoming.” Our homecoming path will move all the way through language before we reach our final destination, -- the shared birthright of all who seek a "homecoming." Keeping an open mind is what life’s meaning is about, but, as simple as that sounds,  it is probably not for everyone. For "the seekers,” though, this "homecoming trek," I am told, is no less rewarding than the actual destination itself—go figure, and good luck!|`|lKVQ6OXYaa	this is probably the oldest question...and it has not been answered yet...and it has also been answered many times...which answer is correct?? no one knows....this question will also stay on in our curious minds forever....we need to know because human beings brains are hard wired to find out and ask questions...we are not content till we can answer all questions...it has to do with wanting to know everything...this is really impossible..because we will never know everything...the universes/s are too vast....as intellectual knoledge which can be proven and documented....we will never know. but as an experience we will know everything in a moment....rather we will be a part of it all...and thus know it all by knowing our true nature...cause all is one...on a spiritual level and we are slowly finding out this truth even on a scientific level.....actually all our science and spirituality is all the same thing...just different facets...it is all a beautiful mystery...one that can be experienced and not known....one mind is too small to know it all...|`|DIlNnjf8aa	42|`|12f59c0eff40e0dd2448be89eb19306aaa	-The meaning of life is to enjoy(the soul is by nature full of bliss)<br>  -Because the spirit soul is present, without the spirit soul there isn't life, dead matter only.<br>  -Life aroused in this material world because the spirit living entity wants to enjoy separated from God, and he get material bodies and material senses in order to enjoy dead matter.<br>  -Because there is only suffering in this world, and we foolishly thinking that we are enjoying.

DIlNnjf8aa	The question is not about the postwar occupation of Germany by the Soviets, it's about World War 1.<br>  <br>  Before WW1, the communist movement was connected worldwide by the "Second International". The decisions of the Second International specified that no national member communist group should support a war by the government of its own country. For example, English communists would oppose English participation in a war, Spanish communists would oppose Spanish participation in a war, etc.<br>  <br>  But when the war actually came, most of the national communist groups promptly abandoned the policy of the Second International and supported the war efforts of their own countries. The exception was a section of the German communists (the Spartacists) who resolutely opposed the war from within Germany. Hence, they were branded as betraying Germany.|`|SUxniVOqaa	Hi.<br>  They did it the same way to the Germans as to the rest of the world. In Eastern Europe progress slowed down, people who didn′t like the system there fled to the west and as a result the authorities changed these countries to prisons. The Berlin wall is perhaps the best testament to this, it was meant to keep the citizens in. Communisms is a very centralized and bureaucratic way of doing things, somewhat like the EU today. <br>  <br>  They betrayed the Germans by not providing them with the freedom, development and advances that most other countries enjoyed over that period.

ceBTTCPwaa	Brave New World is a novel by Aldous Huxley, written in 1931 and published in 1932. Set in the London of AD 2540 (632 A.F. in the book), the novel anticipates developments in reproductive technology and sleep-learning that combine to change society. The future society is a living embodiment of the ideals that form the basis of futurism.

If you don't like the society, just take some random snippets, like the training of the babies to hate pretty things.

Do you think there's free will in a society where babies are conditioned to hate and fear certain things? What in the world would be wrong with an unhappy populace? Revolutions come to mind.

0xekiwHQaa	This has been asked so many times. o.o;<br>  <br>  Rosalie and Jasper are supposed to be twins so the Cullens just decided to keep their last names as Hale to make their story more believable.|`|j7D3Sazraa	They're the Hales because Emmett and Rosalie and Alice and Jasper are you know, together. It'd be strange if brothers and sisters were together.|`|i4g8dHWXaa	Um, maybe Rose and Jasp are some how related? Or it is just a cowincident?|`|DDTiZRvzaa	Okay, Jasper and Rosalie are acting like "twins" and also Esme's neice and nephew, their mother supposdly died and Esme took them in, and before she took them in it was Hale, but that is all a charade. Like they all act like humans.  Rosalie's last name would be Cullen because she is legally married to Emmett who take the name Cullen and Alice would be a Hale. But they act like they are in High School. So yeah....hope I helped!|`|hAEp0gucaa	Because they weren't turned into vampires by Carlisle, they joined the family together as vampires already.<br>  <br>  Oh no hang on that was Alice and whoever she is with.|`|sKPIF3Emaa	Rosalie and Jasper were supposed to be "twins" because they're both blonde...|`|Lw5LaIriaa	Rosalie's real name is Hale, if I remember correctly and because Jasper and her are supposed to be twins, I would think that is why they both have the same name rather than anyone else. But also because all the Cullens are going out and it would be awfully odd if they all had the same name and because they're married and what not. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps =D|`|cgnUhZXiaa	They actually go by Roaslie and Jasper Cullen other than school. In school, they go by Roaslie and Jasper Hale because they look the most alike of the five, like ferternal twins. That adds to illusion. Also, them not having the same last name add to the illusion.<br>  Hope this helps!|`|9I52FNnwaa	thats a good question i never thought about it the only one i can really answer is why rosalie and jasper are hale and well thats because when they go to school they wont be able to be a couple with emmett and alice if their last name is cullen too|`|rExtcGxoaa	Well since Alice and Jasper are together and Emmett and Rosalie are together, they cant really have the same last name, other wise they would all have the same last name, but they're all still "adopted" by Esme and Carlisle|`|KtS7SUDWaa	Congratulations for being the 100th person to ask this question this week.

oo1bOj9caa	The 1992 Maastricht Treaty obliges most EU member states to adopt the euro upon meeting certain monetary and budgetary requirements, however, not all states have done so. The United Kingdom and Denmark negotiated exemptions,[8] while Sweden turned down the euro in a 2003 referendum, and has circumvented the obligation to adopt the euro by not meeting the monetary and budgetary requirements. All nations that have joined the EU since 1993 have pledged to adopt the euro in due course.<br>  The reason Great Britain did not join the Euro was that they did not want to loose their sovereignty/control over monetary policy (the interest rates would be set by the ECB rather than the Bank of England) and they would have to meet the budgetary requirements for the treaty

oGdUIrwBaa	This famous drawing shows the concept of equal proportions which help to identify the fact that human beings are perfect. Da Vinci managed to convey the thought that Man and Nature are related and this is a good example of that. This not only connects Man to Nature, but art to science and architecture. The perfect proportions help to build temples and all sort of buildings back in those days. This also shows the spiritual versus the material world as the circle represents the spiritual and square the natural. People have said that this helps to illustrate how we are spiritual beings having a material experience.|`|AA10530246	it is a study of the geometry of human proportion.|`|BcqRS896aa	it shows the ideal proportion of man and how it relates to geometry.<br>  <br>  have a kid stand in front of a large sheet of paper, arms out straight, feet together. put a dot at each spot. Now have them put the arms up, feet to the sides, and put different color dots.<br>  <br>  then draw the circle and square based on the dots. <br>  <br>  to be honest with you though, the 'proportions' of the the square and the circle don't really mean anything. you can pretty much put circles and squares around any 2 body poses and make it look geometric.<br>  <br>  don't get me wrong, leonardo was great, but this vitruvian man is kind of lame.<br>  <br>  If you want to teach body proportions look to Andrew Loomis.

ygGr1nX7aa	Not sure about this, but I think they would fly the colours (that is, show the flag) of a nation, imitating a ship of that country, and only hoist their pirate flag when it was too late to get away.|`|uidg8Uh0aa	fly another flag,<br>  deserty the deck and make it appear as if the ship was unmanned<br>  or race the other ships, pirate ships were usually smaller in size and lighter whereas the boats they attacked were trading ships going to the new colonies loaded with goods, people and animals sometimes.|`|AA10725882	A common "ruse de guerre" (ruse of war) was to fly friendly flags until ships were close - then at the last moment switch to a pirate flag.  Intimidation was useful.  Most pirate attacks were not contested.  That is what most pirates preferred.<br>  <br>  From Wiki <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartholomew_Roberts" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartholomew...</a><br>  "Bartholomew Roberts (born John Roberts on May 17, 1682 – died February 10, 1722) was a Welsh pirate who raided shipping off the Americas and West Africa between 1719 and 1722. He was the most successful pirate of the Golden Age of Piracy, capturing far more ships than some of the best-known pirates of this era such as Blackbeard or Captain Kidd. He is estimated to have captured over 470 vessels."|`|M2UWOTAjaa	Ncdoom is right. Other methods including hiding in a narrow bay or inlet and then darting out when a target approached. Merchant ships were heavy in the water and only lightly armed. Pirate ships were usually men of war, much faster and more heavily armed. For instance the Spanish Galleons were adequate ships for trading but were hopelessly outclassed by English men of war ships.<br>  Piracy also succeeded because the various port cities they used for hiding out were glad to get the discount loot the pirates brought with them.

Nd6uItCDaa	He seems to 'perfect' almost as if he's fake.<br>  He can be over-protective and quite pananoid sometimes.<br>  He suffers from a green disease...and it's called jealousy.<br>  He's a character, he won't ever exist in reality. <br>  Oh I don't know...maybe because he's a vampire??<br>  He wanted Bella to kill Renesme just to keep her safe, I mean hello? It's her child too.<br>  <br>  He's very smart and talented which is a plus, and is actually understanding unlike many other male characters.<br>  Generally described as good-looking.<br>  Is not full of himself and doesn't suffer from 'wandering hands'.<br>  He's also faithful and loyal to Bella.<br>  <br>  He's different, the typical definition of a good-looking guy is tall dark and handsome. Meaning if you don't have a tan you can't be considered as good-looking. Which I think is a stupid stereotype.|`|m33uUyRYaa	well no dislikes<br>  i love how euphoric he is how he will protect bella no matter what and that he stays with her even though it takes so much strength not to kill her and i love how he wants her to live out her life right and how he doesn't try to hide things from her when he doesn't need to and how amazing he is and interested in her and not bored or annoyed or how patient he is <br>  his strengths are everything literally reading minds<br>  and nothing bad about him|`|qThmcR1Aaa	As I keep calling him, he's the Glittery Vampire Who Just Wants to Cuddle.<br>  <br>  I don't know why young girls find him so irresistibly hot, because the only thing he is, is scary and creepy. He's obsessive. He's controlling. He's smothering. He's manipulative. He's jealous. He's basically a stalker. He's 100 years old, and he's in love with a 17-year-old girl. And he watches her sleep. If he were a real guy, you'd be calling the cops on him, not falling in love with him.<br>  <br>  And why would he fall for a plain, clumsy, unremarkable girl, when he's immortal, been all around the world, and could have anyone he wanted? Just because her blood smells good? I'm all for fantasy stories, but the premise has to at least be believable.|`|wKSvnna2aa	Rather flat. And I'm not talking about his face.|`|ZTxaaV1Iaa	Dislikes: There are a lot of things that I dislike about him. First, I personally think that he attracts too much attention from the girls, from the story and in real life. From example, most of my friends are just screaming at me, "OH MY GOD! EDWARD CULLEN IS HOT!" It is really annoying! Second, he is such a show off! In Breaking Dawn, he did flips when jumping over the lake (when he was showing Bella, even Bella thought so!). I guess, many people just like him, but I don' t really. I really dislike how he is sooo over-protective of Bella. It really get's on my nerves!<br>  <br>  Likes: Well, I like his hair, well when Robert Patterson plays him. It just sticks up in places and is this interesting bronze color. It really suits him! I like his skin tone as well. I really like that pale-white color, it looks really cool! (A lot of my friends- the ones who are Twilight fans are aiming for that skin color and are waiting from people to say that they look vampire-like.) I also like how he loves Bella (though he is too over-protective most of the time)<br>  <br>  Flaws: Pretty much the same as dislikes.<br>  <br>  Strengths: He's really good at attracting attention! I'm not really sure whether I would count that as a bad thing or not. He is really fast. Sometimes I wish I could run as fast he could! That would be awesome! He looks cute, okay? I have to admit that, though I'm not totally  obsessed with him.<br>  <br>  Bad Things About Him: The same as dislikes.<br>  <br>  Overall, he's okay, I guess. Though I'm glad that I am not one of those Edwardian freaks!<br>  <br>  -Icy|`|A9nsilNNaa	he is too protective over bella. he doesn't give he the freedom she should have (such as visiting jacob) because he is too afraid of her gettting hurt. He does get better as the series progresses and he does do it because he cares, but he can get on my nerves sometimes.|`|CCjBk5dDaa	He's the perfect man, every girl's dream guy in nearly every way. <br>  <br>  His flaw is that he doesn't, and won't ever, exist. This will not happen, sorry gals.<br>  <br>  This is why I hate Twilight. Aside from the vampire storyline, this perfect romance stuff doesn't happen.|`|6GqTCmYLaa	boring|`|XhirXRkpaa	He is a an absolute tragedy, and he IS NOT hot.|`|j7D3Sazraa	1. I dislike how controlling Edward is. Hello, I mean if a girl wants to go see her friend, she doesn't need her boyfriend's permission. He is so pushy! And overly dramatic. Come on! He's constantly going on about how he's "dangerous" and "not good enough" and then he goes and says "I love you. I'm going to stay with you."<br>  And the fact that vampires sparkle isn't really the best idea. I mean, WHAT THE HELL WAS STEPHENIE MEYER THINKING? Vampires sparkle? Then, they're supposed to be all strong and tough. And sparkly. Good idea, Steph.<br>  <br>  2. Pass.       Fine, I guess I have to admit that I'm impressed by how much he loves Bella(if you can call lust love). But it really doesn't seem like it.<br>  <br>  3. Like I said above, he's so freaking dramatic. And sparkly!<br>  <br>  4. He has super-strength. Does that count?<br>  <br>  5. Oh my god! This is like the third time you've asked this. His flaws are bad things about him! You have my answer above! Oh, I l almost forgot: stalker, pedophile, SPARKLY.|`|uhHfm3Azaa	i love him. he's really dark and deep but tries so hard to lighten up for bella. he's so adorable and great.
oVeGMNsLaa	My best bet would be anything written by Laurell K. Hamilton, but especially her Meredith Gentry series.  They are inherently sexy and full of well-written sex, but they also have a really great, spell-binding story.  Of course, it'll help if you're interested in the fantasy/horror genre, since that's what it is, but really, it's a great plot line.|`|FATyhyZ2aa	The Sleeping Beauty trilogy by Anne Rice<br>  <br>  (Oh No, I didn't!)<br>  <br>  It's more like what I'd call porn yet it can be found at those big named book stores.

I have a FinePix S700 by FujiFilm (digital), so I will assume you have a digital camera and that they are similar. On the top of my camera, there is a selector control:  Auto, video, anti-shake and other settings.  Normally, I keep it in the Auto setting and pictures are clear, even when using telephoto.  See if your camera has a control for settings and marked for Auto. Use that setting and see if it does help.  Too bad your friend didn't give you the owner's manual when you purchased the camera.  One other thing - how large of a group is it when you take the picture?   Focal length can make a difference on some cameras and the farther away you are from the subject(s), without a telephoto setting, you will get blurring.  Hope this helps.

You need to use a smaller aperture to get more in focus.  Try using aperture priority (av I think on Canon)  and set the aperture to a bigger number (smaller f/stop)  The smaller your aperture the slower your shutter speed will be, so if you are inside use a flash or a higher ISO.    A good starting point would be f/5.6 for a small group. f/8 or f/11 for larger groupings.  Focus on the middle row.  <br>  <br>  You can read or dl the manual from Canon's website.

uHZUKAF7aa	"Though everything else may appear shallow and repulsive,even the smallest task in music is so absorbing,and carries us so far away from town,country,earth,and all worldly things,that it is truly a blessed gift of God."--Felix Mendelssohn|`|TZ8KedjYaa	YOU SAID BETWEEN RIGHT? YES IT IS BECAUSE YOU LISTEN TO MUSIC IN REALITY AND IF YOU DAYDREAM YOUR BETWEEN IT|`|Xl7Hak1Zaa	Maybe the music dreams from some experience|`|3tz4GyIaaa	i agree with the first answerer, when music wasn't invented, I'm sure people could still dream.|`|BVSa6bYkaa	There were several experiments done in the past regarding music. Music heals. One experiment was done with plants. In one room there was a plant set right next to a speaker playing beautiful music. In a second completely separate room there was a plant set next to a speaker playing noisy, chaotic music. In a third separate room, there was a plant all by itself.  In a couple of weeks the plant that was next to the beautiful music GREW toward the speaker.  The plant next to the noisy music GREW AWAY from the speaker and died.  The plant all by itself in silence GREW STRAIGHT UP!   Musical notes are in harmony with each one of us.  Our inner bodies respond to a note in particular.  People have healed by listening to notes of music that responds to their organs. Everything has a vibration--heartbeats, music, mother earth, etc.  Have you ever heard a singers voice that  gave you physical goose bumbs or heard a song that left you feely cranky?  Dreams are all jumbled because they come out of our subconcious mind which unless one links there conscious mind to the sub-remains a mystery.  What I mean by link is for example:  There is a personal issue in my life or circumstance I may be living in that is difficult; yet consciously I continuously fumble for some sort of solution on what I need to do yet I remain unsure and stay in the situation thinking I don't know what to do.  Instead of spinning in circles consciously searching for the answers I need, I consciously tell my subconscious to find the answer.  Because contrary to what many believe, We know the answer to all our problems, just not always consciously. Consciously searching for the answer to our problems can actually crystallize into non-action.  "Let go and give it to your subconscious--the answer will come when the time is right. Don't force it-- the subconscious knows.|`|RFK812kjaa	No. Dreams were around before music, and dreams are a strange parallel to reality: sometimes the give you insight to what's true in your subconscious, and other times you're running through a jungle from a pack of angry Tarzans. <br>  <br>  Sometimes there's no link at all between dreams and reality, unless your dream is about music itself there's not link through there either.|`|Mqh3Lrjlaa	It's more general than that.<br>  The link is a collaboration of the senses.<br>  I'd make emotion a 6th sense, but perhaps the other 5 working together create just that. <br>  <br>  <br>  (Music=sound.)|`|y8bFwXZEaa	Are you saying that before men invented music, our ancient ancestors did not dream?

TbTO5SXlaa	I did a bit of research and found this:<br>  <br>  The Sigma lens you list is $189.00 at B&H.<br>  <br>  The Canon 70-300mm f4-5.6 IS USM lens is $549.00 at B&H.<br>  <br>  The Canon 70-200mm f2.8L IS USM lens is $1,699.00 at B&H.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bhphotovideo.com</a><br>  <br>  Obviously, a lens costing $189.00 is one with many compromises - none of them in the direction of quality.<br>  <br>  $1,150.00 is an awful lot to pay for one f-stop unless you absolutely, positively need it (for shooting sports at night or indoors) - and don't need the extra 100mm of focal length.<br>  <br>  If you had said your budget was unlimited then I'd say go for the 70-200mm f2.8L lens. So my suggestion is to buy the Canon 70-300mm f4-5.6 lens with IS.<br>  <br>  Although you lose a full stop when you zoom from 70mm to 300mm wide-open, this shouldn't be a problem in most situations. We need look no farther than the venerable "Sunny 16 Rule" which states: "On a sunny day, set your aperture to f16 and your shutter speed to 1/ISO" to develop an example of how that one stop loss will affect us.<br>  <br>  So lets suppose we're outside shooting on a bright, sunny day using ISO 100.<br>  <br>  f16 @ 1/100 sec.  "Sunny 16 Rule"<br>  f11 @ 1/200 sec.<br>  f8 @ 1/400 sec.<br>  f5.6 @ 1/800 sec.<br>  f4 @ 1/1600 sec.<br>  <br>  300mm is easily hand-holdable at 1/800 sec. or 1/400 sec. The IS will help at 1/200 sec. and 1/100 sec.<br>  <br>  Our only real concern would be in low-light and here again the IS will be of use.<br>  <br>  Buy the Canon 70-300mm f4-5.6 IS USM lens.|`|Bk4eIAWWaa	I have owned two Sigma lenses. One crumbled at the mounting area and locked up at a certain mm, the other (the one you are asking about) has terrible focus through out most of the zoom range. I bought a Canon and it is preferable.|`|65109cb8f29d34e3d6fc411bd1edae58aa	Cameras and the firmware in cameras have become so sophisticated that I can't imagine that a third party could get it exactly right.<br>  <br>  To maintain forward compatibility buy OEM lenses. In this case, go Canon.<br>  <br>  ***<br>  <br>  Side note: Either one of those lenses are poor performers optically. Decide which zoom range you will be operating in most and get a Prime. A prime 300mm lens is way, way more sharper, colorful and contrasty than a f/4-5.6 lens zoomed out to 300mm.

They are also much harder to translate into Greek or Latin which are the two biggest historical influences on the modern day languages of Western Europe.<br>  <br>  Ancient Egyptian has also been a dead language for a very long time, even the Egyptians themselves stopped using it and stopped keeping records of what it actually meant.

Don't get me wrong, it's a good book, but it's not great, it's not even Austen's best work.  Her final book Emma was a far superior book.  <br>  <br>  Catcher in the Rye is highly overrated as well.

ceBTTCPwaa	The Divine Right of Kings is a political and religious doctrine of royal absolutism. It asserts that a monarch is subject to no earthly authority, deriving his right to rule directly from the will of God. The king is thus not subject to the will of his people, the aristocracy, or any other estate of the realm, including the church. The doctrine implies that any attempt to depose the king or to restrict his powers runs contrary to the will of God and may constitute heresy.<br>  <br>  The remoter origins of the theory are rooted in the medieval idea that God had bestowed earthly power to the king, just as God had given spiritual power and authority to the church, centering on the pope. The immediate author of the theory was Jean Bodin, who based it on the interpretation of Roman law. With the rise of nation-states and the Protestant Reformation, the theory of Divine Right justified the king's absolute authority in both political and spiritual matters. The theory came to the fore in England under the reign of King James I (1603–25). King Louis XIV of France (1643–1715), though Catholic, strongly promoted the theory as well.<br>  <br>  The theory of Divine Right was abandoned in England during the Glorious Revolution of 1688–89. The American and French revolutions of the late eighteenth century further weakened the theory's appeal, and by the early twentieth century, it had been virtually abandoned.<br>  <br>  Such doctrines are, in the English speaking world, largely associated with the House of Tudor and the early House of Stuart in Britain and the theology of the Caroline divines who held their tenure at the pleasure of James I of England (James VI of Scotland), Charles I and Charles II.<br>  <br>  The Scots textbooks of the Divine Right of Kings were written in 1597-98 before his accession to the English throne by James, whose Basilikon Doron, a manual on the duties of a King, was written to edify his four-year-old son Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, who died young. According to the text, a good King: "acknowledgeth himself ordained for his people, having received from the god a burden of government, whereof he must be countable". The idea of the divine right to rule has appeared in many cultures Eastern and Western spanning all the way back to the first God King Gilgamesh.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_Right_of_Kings" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divine_Righ...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inourtime/inourtime_20071011.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/history/inou...</a> : The Divine Right of Kings, from the BBC programme In our Time.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	What was believed, mainly by kings, was that God Almighty had arranged for that person to be king.  Had He wanted someone else to be king, then he would have made someone else king, but He didn't so the king was king by the grace of God.<br>  <br>  To this day, Queen Elizabeth is introduced by a string of titles, ending with, "...by the Grace of God, Queen of England." (her other titles include Queen of Wales, Scotland, and Northern ireland, etc)<br>  <br>  What this means is that the king need not answer, and cannot answer to any earthly power, such as the people, the nobles, or even the Church, because (and this is good) if God made the man the king, then everything that the man says or does has been ordained by God when he arranged to make the man the king!  <br>  <br>  It's good old Republican circular reasoning:  God made the man king, so God wants the king to do what he wants because that's why God made the man the king.  Whew!  <br>  <br>  BTW, George W.

ca64f074806522d41931e7a2676ce936aa	All the facetious and vaguely xenophobic comments don't answer your question. Someone has mentioned the Norman Conquest. This effectively resulted in the Kings of England also ruling large parts of France. This increased when the Plantagenet dynasty ruled. It was not so much a question of 'England' invading 'France' but English kings defending territories in France that they saw as their own.

With countries such as France we have done this several times and got absolutely no thanks for it. Instead we have got only resentment avarice and hostility. You tell me the reasons for it.
89io4Qdhaa	If you check out Wikipedia there is a paragraph about the death of Stalin which does refer to the boast by Beria that he poisoned Stalin, however the article suggests that whether or not this is true will never be known for certain.<br>   The cause of death was a cerebral hemorrhage from which he collapsed and died 4 days later.

DIlNnjf8aa	Stalin was in charge of the membership efforts of the Communist Party. He used this post to recruit people who would support him. Eventually he was able to isolate and remove his opponents by classifying them as either "right wing" (e.g. Bukharin) or "left wing" (e.g. Trotsky).|`|JtJenkgXaa	A member of the October Revolution Committee 1917,Stalin became general secretary of the Communist Party 1922.After Lenin's death 1924,Stalin sought to create 'socialism in the country' and clashed with Trotsky,who denied the possibility of socialism inside Russia until revolution had occurred in W Europe.Stalin won this ideological struggle by 1927,and a series of five years plan was launched collectivise  industry and agriculture from 1928<br>  As dictator in the 1930s,he disposed of all real and imagined enemies.|`|64TZxPtXaa	Stalin had no enemies after Lenin's death<br>  Trotsky was named at first by Lenin in his place but had to leave Russia<br>  Stalin had a lot of influence within the party
DIlNnjf8aa	Mostly they didn't.<br>  <br>  They joined the nazis in the Hitler Youth.<br>  <br>  Ultimately only about 10 or 20 percent of German teens were able to avoid participating in the Hitler Youth.<br>  <br>  "At the end of 1933, the HJ had 2,300,000 members. Much of these increases came from the more or less forcible merger of other youth organizations with the HJ. (The sizable Evangelische Jugend, a Lutheran youth organisation of 600,000 members, was integrated on February 18, 1934).<br>  <br>  By December 1936, HJ membership stood at just over five million. That same month, HJ membership became mandatory, under the Gesetz über die Hitlerjugend law. This legal obligation was re-affirmed in 1939 with the Jugenddienstpflicht and HJ membership was required even when it was opposed by the member's parents. From then on, most of Germany's teenagers belonged to the HJ. By 1940, it had eight million members."|`|oo1bOj9caa	They did not fight back. They were conscripted into the army or the Hitler Youth or had to work in order to survive in a time of economic hardship that was prevalent in Europe due to the Great Depression from 1929-1933 and particularly in Germany due to the reparation payments Germany had to pay to the countries who won the first world war. |One of the attractions of the Nazis was that they argued not to pay anymore and to paint Germany as the victim of unfair treatment.|`|NYU37jfGaa	I don't think very many of them did.

However, I would suggest using watercolour as they blend much easier together and if you want the impressionistic "William Turner" effect, then you'll get it. As for "Monet", his patchy work would best be mimiced though pastels in my opinion as the watercolour would make the colours blend into each other.|`|xoXkHOVsaa	Use acrylic, oils, or oil pastel.

You could do this by painting the same person's face twice, or you could show a contrast between body language and facial expression. eg a curled over, introverted, arms crossed person with a smile on their face. <br>  <br>  I like the baby/old woman idea. I don't think its too obvious, but what you could do, maybe to make it less obvious, is draw a baby's face with very wise, sad eyes(maybe even draw a couple of faint wrinkles around the eyes to really emphasise the point), or an old woman's face with very childlike innocence and joy. <br>  <br>  Sorry, I know this has just been an extension of your ideas, but I think that your original ideas were very good! the only thing I would add, like I explained above, is contrast, or a conflicting face and meaning. Eg old woman with childlike eyes etc.<br>  <br>  Good luck on your exam.|`|cY0E5Yepaa	Your idea sounds amazing! <br>  You could do faces from differnt countires (ie: Chinese African or japanese.) this would give a good varitey and show the facial differences. <br>  Goodluck!|`|vFtdEejAaa	Hi, your idea sounds pretty good :) I'm not too good at art but you could have like different skin tones, from different cultures. eg chinese eyes, wrinkles on the forehead and stuff like that.

War 1 Weapons <br>   Mustard gas was the most notable weapon employed by the Germans. From what I've read, it had quite a horrific effect on those unfortunate enough to inhale it. When inhaled it immediately caused the lungs to liquefy. Death came quickly but painfully, so I gather. Chemical warfare was first introduced in WW1. Also Chlorine gas was another gas used by the Germans. <br>  <br>  Aircrafts made their first appearance as weapons in WWI. Germany used Zeppelins (a type of aircraft), submarines (U-Boats), and tanks. Mustard gas along with other chemicals were used (this is the first appearance of chemical warfare). <br>  <br>  Soldiers wore masks to protect them from a horrible new weapon called poison gas. It caused blinding and death by choking. One type of gas is mustard gas. That would kill you if you breathed it in. You would eventually choke up your liver and die instantly. The machine gun was another new weapon for World War 1. The submarine was an effective warship, known as a U-boat. It was a self-propelled underwater missile. If they didnt have gas masks they would pee in a rag and put that up to their face, for somehow something in the pee eradicates the poisin chemical when inhailed. <br>  <br>  Rifles, artillery, machine guns, aircraft ships, submarines, poison gas, tanks, armored cars, grenades and mortars were all used during World War 1. <br>  <br>  The Americans used the shotgun during the war, which they used to great effect at clearing the enemy trenches of German soldiers. This provoked a horrified reaction from the German government, as wounds from shotgun hits were difficult to treat. As I'm sure you know, the shots spread out and hit the victim in many different places, which would lead to a long and painful death. The Germans called on the use of shotguns in warfare to be banned. <br>  <br>  Both sides of the trenches decided on not using mustard gas because masses of soldiers were getting wiped out, and if they threw it and the wind blew the other way, they would affect their own men. <br>  <br>  Army: Mustard Gas, Artillery, Rifles, Mines and other sorts of guns. Navy: Battleships, Dreadnoughts, Mines, Destroyers, Cruisers, Minesweepers, U-boats or submarines (Called depending on which side you're on). Air Force: Triplanes and Biplanes. (The Germans also used Zeppelins) <br>  <br>  Defensive technology was better than offensive which is why the stalemate situation started and the war was no longer an active war and was now a tactic war. Machine Guns - They fired about 450-600 bullets per minute. I don't know exactly, but it would wipe out any soldiers or cavalry that attempted to cross no man's land. Trenches - Both sides built trenches which barely moved during the war. Over the war, trenches were adapted and became very good. The German's trenches were especially good and provided them with a great defense against shells. (the battle of the Somme- Haig used millions of shells but the Germans survived through staying in their trenches. Barbed wire - The wire was extremely thick and took a long time to cut through. It was said that sunlight could not be seen through it. Gas - It was a very painful death although it was only useful in surprise attacks as it was easily solved with gas masks. Also it was possible that the wind could change direction and kill you instead. Tanks - These were first used by the British although were fairly unreliable as many broke down and others got stuck in shell holes. Shells - These were used in large quantities although again were fairly unreliable. It did take a long time to hit the target and many didn't go off. Also it did make no mans land very muddy and very hard to cross. <a href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_weapons_were_used_in_World_War_1" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_weapons_w...</a><br>  Flamethrower; hated, feared and used by all.Although first used by the German Army during WW1,<a href="http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-weapons/flamethrowers.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-weap...</a>                                Bayonets <a href="http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-weapons/bayonets.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-weap...</a>           <br>  Personal weapons of the ordinary Digger in WW1<br>  <a href="http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-weapons/allied_ww1.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.diggerhistory.info/pages-weap...</a>   First World War: Weapons <a href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FWWweapons.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FWW...</a>|`|BTk2yLqbaa	Sure the machine gun, and artillery, were devastating in WWI. But another weapon system which certainly proved its worth back then was the submarine. German U-boats sank vast quantities of Allied shipping. The millions upon millions of tons sent to the bottom debilitated the Allied economies and war effort, and showed just how deadly and economical submarines could be. A small submersible vessel could sink a major surface ship, and evade retribution by hiding in the depths. The U-boats were not decisive, as the convoy system was adopted but they certainly proved their worth.|`|M2UWOTAjaa	In terms of destructive power, it was the artillery. These huge guns could hurl 1 ton shells 10 miles or more. The Russians lost the war for several major reasons but one of them was because they had inadequate artillery.<br>  In April or May of 1918, the Allies learned how to pinpoint the location of enemy artillery by using sound echoing and triangulating the two explosions. When a portion of a front line loses its artillery, it is now open to invasion, which was exactly what happened. With this new technology and fresh American troops the war was over in 6 months.|`|2gztS2cYaa	machine gun|`|MFF61HvDaa	If you mean at stopping the enemy, it was the machine-gun. For example, it was responsible for 90% of the British casualties (60,000) on the opening day of the Battle of the Somme.<br>  Throughout the war, the machine-gun caused more casualties than any other weapon.

KBBonf97aa	Harper Lee's father was a small-town, Alabama lawyer during the era in which "To Kill a Mockingbird" was set, so Lee would have enjoyed Scout's familiarity with legal proceedings as a child (Lee also studied law later).  Finch was also Lee's mother's maiden name.  Like Scout, Lee was a tomboy who mostly hung out with neighborhood boys, including Truman Capote, who was presumably the basis for the character of Dill.  And the character Boo Radley is based on a man who lived down the street from Lee and Capote.  Both Lee and Capote acknowledged that the character dynamics in "Mockingbird" are based on ones they knew in real life, so it's very possible that Lee included many autobiographical things in her only novel.<br>  <br>  A lot of people have speculated that "Mockingbird" was actually written by Capote as a gift to Lee, since Capote occasionally published under the names of his closest friends.  In his "Other Voices, Other Rooms," there's a character exactly like Boo Radley who leaves objects in trees, but remains mysterious to the neighborhood kids.  But since Capote also incorporated people he knew in life into his novels as characters, it makes sense that both he and Lee would use the real-life Boo Radley as the basis for a character.|`|Y4RS35M7aa	It sounds like you need to learn more about Nell Harper Lee, Pulitzer Prize winner for "To Kill a Mockingbird."

dLHmyy2Qaa	I don't know of any average, it would totally depend on book subject and what the publishing house thinks it's worth - and whether the author is tied into a contract to write more. You could try asking some publishers, but I think the answer you'd get is that it's a private contract/matter between author and publisher and no-one else's business. <br>  <br>  Unless said author tells other people of course. It's a toughie!|`|8asG4WCwaa	Information is difficult to get.  However,. Publisher's Weekly often includes such information, since many agents list their sales there (not necessarily exact amounts).  BookWire keeps many kinds of lists, and I know I've seen debute novels and their advances there at one time.  You can look on websites for writer's organizations - Author's Guild, Romance Writers of America, etc. Even the NY Times may have information on specific authors.|`|a0a4b271882587e60ffff0e04ab06fb3aa	I'm a published fantasy author. My latest title took about 3 years to write and another 2 years to get published. It has been reviewed very highly in the mainstream media and is being considered for a movie production.<br>  <br>  You asked about contract information. The spectrum for that runs from the sublime to the ridiculous. Some publishers pay very small advances while others pay astronomical amounts. For a first timer, you shouldn't expect much--perhaps as little as a $1,000. However, that's good news and bad news. Remember, we're talking advance money, which means you have to earn all of that back before you see another dime from your publisher. The more you get up front, the longer it takes to get the next check.<br>  <br>  Figure on 3 years from when you first start shopping your book around until you see it in print (assuming it's good and you can find an agent to rep it.) But hey, what's 3 years? Trust me, it's WORTH it when you hear, "Your book is like Braveheart meets the Lord of the Rings," which a Hollywood producer just said to me a few days ago.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.

Baxley<br>  FiveStarAuthor@aol.com<br>  <br>  *****|`|nNOGb7Z8aa	One of the pitfalls of publishing is that there is no source like what you're looking for. Unlike athletes or actors, writers tend to stay quiet about what they make.<br>  <br>  I do know that you're given a payment of so much at publishing, and when the sales of your book reach a certain point, you start to receive more money.<br>  <br>  Mostly, newbie writers get jack, but once you get over the publishing hump, it gets easier.

T0gS8uUtaa	Public works schemes- such as the autobahns<br>  Conscription - men over the age of 18 were encouraged to join the army <br>  women were not allowed to work which therefore reduced the amount of unemployed because the Nazi's simply didnt count them as that.|`|60b0d42c3c92dec6d976704c90ee8eb5aa	Hitler was made Chancellor in 1933.<br>  6 years later, the war started.<br>  So there was plenty to do, getting ready for war.<br>  All those planes, shells, tanks etc had to be made, as well at the infrastructure improved. Then millions were recruited into the fighting services.|`|1hvrQYWiaa	Initially, a huge public works program was implemented. The main project was construction of the German motorway system, the autobahns.The Nazis deliberately made sure the construction was labour intensive, with most of the work being done without the use of heavy machinery. This was so construction would take longer, thus keeping more people in work longer.<br>   Beginning in 1935, the Nazis started rearmament.Under the Treaty of Versailles, the German army was limited to 100,000 men, and was not allowed tanks. There was also no airforce, no u-boats and no large warships allowed.<br>   So, once rearmament started, there were jobs in the army (conscription was reintroduced) plus in the new German airforce (the Luftwaffe) and an expanded navy.<br>   Further, these new soldiers,sailors and airmen needed to be uniformed and equipped, so this provided many new jobs for German industry. Government contracts and cheap government loans were given to small,medium, and large businesses to enable them to hire workers.<br>   By 1936 unemployment had largely disappeared in Germany, and the Nazi economic policies had brought Germany out of the Great Depression, the first country where this happened|`|02JUswskaa	They gave the citizens work on Germany's internal infrastructure; such as building new roads and houses etc. This gave the Nazis the political advantage of positive propaganda to achieve their ultimate aims. <br>  <br>  The German people were encouraged to be outraged by the reparations for the first world war, whilst at the same helping themselves to become a strong and independent country once again.

M2XQMPNNaa	I don't know how to make them that small but you can make small realistic looking footprints by making your hand into a fist and using the meat of your pinky-side of your hand as the base for a little foot.(this will be the side of your hand the meaty part that starts at the base of your palm pinky side, when you make a fist turn your hand so that this side faces down onto the object you are looking to make the footprints on) Then use a finger to poke in the toes. You can practice with paint first on a piece of paper. They are very realistic looking this way, the natural lines in your hand resemble the striations you would find on the bottom of a foot!

07WvplYKaa	Dear Quetioner<br>  <br>  The Somme battle commenced on the 1 July 1916 following months of build up preparation and weeks of intense artillery bombardment of the German trenches. It was the first great battle of WW1 to involve large numbers of British volunteers who enlisted in 1914.<br>  The battle was fought to relieve pressure on the French Army at the fortress town of Verdun. The German Army tried to capture Verdun and to bleed France white in a battle of attrition. The losses were enormous but the German Army never captured the Town. They had to divert resources in defence of the Somme front.<br>  The first day of the Somme battle was the greatest disaster for the British Army. There were thousands of casualties on the first day alone and if I can remember correctly 17000 in the first five minutes.<br>  The battle continued into November but the small gain in territory could never be justified by the huge losses.<br>  Good books by serving soldiers at the time are:-<br>  'Goodbye to All That' by Robert Graves and<br>  'Memoirs of an Infantry Officer' by Siegfried Sassoon.<br>  You will never pass a war memorial again without thinking about the Great War.|`|z4Yeofq8aa	The British had to launch an offensive on the Somme to take pressure off of the French army that was struggling to hold back a German offensive at Verdun. They hoped that the Germans would have to send units from Verdun to reinforce the Somme front and that is what happened.|`|7b5d7721387ea9716cf48828f5d4cc1caa	Why is any war fought?

By the summer, the battle was continuing and the French army was close to cracking.<br>   The British government came under heavy political pressure from France to launch an offensive on their sector of the front to draw German reserves away from Verdun and make things easier for the French .<br>   So, they ordered Haig, the British commander, to launch the Somme offensive.<br>   The attack began on 1 July 1916, following a week long artillery bombardment designed to destroy the German defences.However, the bombardment failed and the British army suffered almost 60,000 casualties on the first day ,20,000 of them killed.The battle dragged on till November without any significant success for the British.|`|89io4Qdhaa	You can get all the facts you need about the battle of the Somme from a google search and look at Wikipedia.  As other answers have said the main reason for the battle was to relieve pressure on the French army who were fighting for their survival around Verdun and had been since February 1916.  The proposal to attack at the Somme had been forced on Haig and his general staff by the French and through political pressure.  It is said that Haig thought the ground very unpromising when he first started to plan the battle.

bd35231f3460dd90e2b79f023a4ce2b1aa	Realistically there are but two options.  The easiest and one that will involve the fewest headaches is to go to the local St. Helen's library and look at copies of the local newspaper on microfilm.  If you don't live near St Helen's then try emailing the archivist in the reference library and see if they will do a search for you.  The articles you seek may have already been indexed in a card file and be quite easy to locate, but they will charge you the best part of ￡20 an hour for any search they do on your behalf, so any help you can give them with a date is a bonus.  As this is 1980, I'd have expected any newspaper that reported on the inquest and murder to have printed a picture that they'd have got from the police, which leads to your second option - contact the local police (not sure if St Helens is Merseyside or Lancashire) and ask the archivist at the County HQ to open their files to you.  You'd probably have to make a FOI (freedom of information) request, but as you are the next of kin you shouldn't have any trouble in viewing the police files at all.  Whether they will actually let you COPY those files is another matter entirely.  What will also have some bearing on the case is whether anyone was ever charged with the crime and whether the case is still open.

B. Yeats, Easter 1916 about the Easter Rising where-in the momentum and conflagration that became the Irish Republic began. The treaty of 1921 that is still resulting in the annexing of the North from the remaining Republic and results in the prophetic last line of each stanza "a terrible beauty is born."<br>  <br>  Yeats, who had been known for his romanticised and gentry views prior to this poem, was noticeably altered by his association with Pearse, Plunkett, MacDonagh, Maud Gonne, Grace Gifford Plunkett, all active in the rising. His family and indeed he himself benefited from the occupying foreign nation, England's tyranny over Ireland. It was not until William met Constance Markievicz and through her Maud Gonne and other rebel leaders and supervisors that William questioned who or what he was and/or wanted to be.  <br>  <br>  In the poem, his bleak and forlorn narrative seems to lead the reader to the each bloody Sunday leading up to the 1916 Rising and the stonebreaker's yard at Kilmainham where the signatories of the proclamation of Poblacht Na h éireann were executed between 5/3/1916 and 5/12/1916, to all those Irish dead before and all those Irish dead after, who died because they lived or crossed a bloody line drawn by politicians. By Yeats phrasing, he ended in promise and hope, as did they all, “for wherever green is worn,” and Ireland, regardless of its’ turmoil proudly, and eternally wears her green.<br>   <br>  The last stanza of the poem is thus:<br>  Too long a sacrifice <br>  Can make a stone of the heart. <br>  O when may it suffice? <br>  That is Heaven's part, our part <br>  To murmur name upon name, <br>  As a mother names her child <br>  When sleep at last has come <br>  On limbs that had run wild. <br>  What is it but nightfall? <br>  No, no, not night but death; <br>  Was it needless death after all? <br>  For England may keep faith <br>  For all that is done and said. <br>  We know their dream; enough <br>  To know they dreamed and are dead; <br>  And what if excess of love <br>  Bewildered them till they died? <br>  I write it out in a verse- <br>  MacDonagh and MacBride <br>  And Connolly and Pearse <br>  Now and in time to be, <br>  Wherever green is worn, <br>  Are changed, changed utterly <br>  A terrible beauty is born <br>  <br>  September 25, 1916

dFXNZ3TSaa	Sense and Sensibility may actually be better since it contains much more thematic debate on the nature of human emotions and relationships and expression of those relationships within the confines of social etiquette. <br>  <br>  Likewise, Northanger Abbey might be a wise choice because of the representation of the Gothic, another aspect of the romantic movement. <br>  <br>  Pride and Prejudice would work as well, as long as you have enough confidence in the connection and can cite enough examples in the text of representations of the romantic. I would use these other two texts as specific examples of Jane Austen's writing following the romantic movement.<br>  <br>  Have fun though. Jane Austen is a good choice since when discussing romanticism one tends to think automatically of the wild passionate romantic poets rather than the more restrained nature of Austen's middle class audience.

It started snowing very lightly. As my Dogs and I walked toward the next clock, It got so quiet. I stood there and looked at the roller coaster in the dark. I was amazed that I could hear every breath that I took. I actually heard each snow flake hit the ground. But it wasn`t quiet for long. One of my dogs who had the lead position, alerted me that she had cornered someone by the bumper cars. I walk over in the dark and took my stance." Let`s go,you can`t be back there."  I couldn`t see anything but my Dog persisted.  So I investigated further and it turned out to be a huge Rat.It ran away and we continued on.

0xekiwHQaa	Don't stress over the beginning. Odds are, you're going to change it a lot when you edit. Think about it for a little while, write something down and then go on with the rest of your story. If you get too hung up on the beginning, you're never going to get past it. <br>  <br>  I also suggest opening up a couple of your favorite books/stories and seeing how those authors started, just to give you an idea. But of course, beginnings differ for each story.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|GNf3tmguaa	keep trying. <br>  um, just keep writing and don't reread wat u have. after u have written a couple pages then read it to see if u like it<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=An9ak.OhpdyOCWIcdI3rUifsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307164100AAEqble">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|XDpX4TVRaa	I sometimes have the exact same problem. I find that just writing through helps, then go back later and rewrite. <br>  Although saying that, even now I still look at my beginning and wonder whether I should change it or not. It can, at times, make me feel like not writing. I know my planning and everything is good, and that when the story moves along it will be interesting and unique. I think it's knowing how much information to put across in the opening chapter. Too much can lead to the reader being swamped with details, not enough, and then it leaves the reader bored and uninterested.<br>  <br>  Personally I have decided that I will write my whole novel, then go back to proofread and rewrite. I can't say that it will help, as I haven't yet finished. But it does seem to be helping.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your writing! I hope you manage to sort things out!<br>  <br>  Tony M|`|yKdTyL3Gaa	all I can say is to keep trying.<br>  I'm a writer and love writing and I'm going through the same thing.<br>  Except its not the beginning, I'm having a difficult time starting this one scene.<br>  anyways, dont just throw away the paragraph. keep it and move on. you could always go back and change it in the future. its not like that whatever you write is the definite story, you know?<br>  Taking breaks can help to. Like go out and get a cup of coffee or something and maybe something will come to mind. Often when you stare at a computer screen trying to write something, what you write is crappy. You can't force yourself to write something amazing, it just has to come to you.<br>  so have patience and keep trying!<br>  maybe you could skip the intro for now.... just jump into another scene of the book then go back to the intro.<br>  <br>  for the beginning you could introduce the main character, describe the setting, state a problem, etc.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|ZQOMEH95aa	OMG! I had the SAME EXACT problem! I had started over 50 stories between 2007-2008 cuz i didn't like the beginnings! Now I'm on page 44 but that's beside the point. <br>  <br>  What I did was not reread what I had written, and when I stopped, if I actually DID reread it, then I would have my sister read it, and she usually said it was awesome. but, if you are self-conscious about that, or don't have siblings, or your siblings would make fun of you for it, then I would write to keep MYSELF interested in it, and not necessarily the reader just yet. Then, once you finish, you can go back and fix anything that you don't like. Just because it's the first chapter doesn't necessarily mean that it has to be all introduction and boring crap. In my book, I made an action scene, and then I just rocketed off from there, and before I knew it, a whole story/plot was unfolding and then I got ideas for the next book and the book after that and such. And, if that doesn't work, I would just tell myself that it probably wasn't as stupid as it seems and that I should just keep going and see what happens. Who knows?|`|bUeMqGgMaa	Don't make yourself write. In other words, don't sit there and rack your brain for ANYTHING to put on paper. Just take it slow and let it come to you. It could come when you least expect it. Another thing, write down all the begginings or introductions and pick the best one. Sometimes, when you do this something might pop into your brain.
3j7WE8jGaa	Another wonderful and quite moving write....and I am sure you are quite correct in your last two lines. My grandfather (whom I never knew) served in France and Belgium towards the end of the First World War as a young man, and I am sure my mother has told me on several occasions that he never talked about his experiences when she was growing up (my mother was born in 1943, almost 25 years after the end of World War 1...and her father was 46 when she was born). She has recently learned more about his war time experiences because she has seen some of the letters he wrote to his parents at the time (I think he wrote good letters, but I have not had a chance to read them, myself)....and she has also visited some of the battle fields where he served....some 90 years on from the end of the war.<br>  <br>  Good write....and thanks for the reminder of your son-in-law's situation....I remember you writing about him leaving at Christmas time.

I have been very lucky in life, in that I have lived almost 32 years, and I have lost remarkably few people who were very close to me. My father's guardian does spring to mind....but the hardest thing when we lost him was the first few days after his passing....and getting through the funeral....things seemed to get easier after that. I think it was a while before I really spent much time thinking of him and remembering the good times....that is certainly what I try to do now. He has been gone for 8 years now.<br>  <br>  Having said all of that....each anniversary of his death does bring back memories....and I think the first anniversary was especially hard....especially since his family live 200 miles away from me...and it is not easy to visit them around the anniversary of his passing. There have been times when I have really wanted to be with them around that time of year....but practicalities always get in the way.<br>  <br>  Good poem....as always....and please keep your chin up!|`|ezunIOIoaa	The  poem  is  a  beautiful  depiction  of  the  war, inner  emotional  war  that  is    going  on  within  the  poet"s  mind, he  is  feeling  helpless,  he  knows  fully  well  that    he  cant  control  the  happenings    that  are  making  him  terribly  aweful,  so  he  tries    hard  to  push  all the  happy  memories  away|`|LmARYQxcaa	Grieving has no schedule...putting it out there won't speed the pain's release.

If its not in you how can it come out of you.|`|DfBH8Dr9aa	Well yes it is true but I believe that if we do not love all people then we don't love anyone. I see people who don't take care of themselves and then of course if they don't even care about themselves then why expect them to care about others?|`|77ZVd5hyaa	That is true, without love you can not give or receive it .

f4Nn0W1xaa	The writing of poems is not called poetry. The writing of poetry is called writing, just as it is with novels.<br>   <br>  In terms of your set up I guess I would fill in your blank with the word literature. <br>  <br>  One use of the word poetry is to refer to the collective whole of the form, rather than a single example. The word literature is used similarly in reference to prose.

WshwHtk9aa	I don't know the plot to your story, but you could also go the "Bill & Ted" route, which is that something about her situation has critical future ramifications, so, in the future when time travel becomes possible, someone comes back to help her make sure that she succeeds and this person provides the time travel ability.<br>  <br>  If her father built a time machine, you might get away without describing *how* he built it, but I think it would definitely be a plot hole if you failed to explain *why* he didn't use it. Or, at least explain that the machine stays here while the subject goes through time, because I think most people's current pop-understanding of time machines is that they tend to go through time with you (The Time Machine, Time Cop, Back to the Future, etc etc). Sometimes only the person goes through (Terminator), but that is rarer in modern fiction.<br>  <br>  If it is a fantasy story (like Narnia), a mystical closet is fine, but if it is sci-fi, I'd avoid such hokey explanations.|`|GNf3tmguaa	i like 1.<br>  <br>  ya, u don't have to go through the details. u can just start it with her next to the machine or something like that.<br>  <br>  another idea is that she just kinda wakes up and she's in the past. she didn't know how she got there or anything. <br>  <br>  of course! i would love to read the story. i can email u mine. its on time-travel too. pinkchic5-random@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=An9ak.OhpdyOCWIcdI3rUifsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307164100AAEqble">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|2hQFdy08aa	"Primer" is an independent, low budget movie about a bunch of scientists accidentally create a time machine when they're trying to do something completely different.  A lot of leaps and bounds in science come from when the engineer was trying to accomplish something else and made a little mistake (like the discovery of penicillin).  I think it'd be cool to have the time machine as an accidental by-product of some other project.  <br>  <br>  the closet thing's been done a bunch of times before, but if you can make it really different you should do it|`|RrB51Mq4aa	Sorry to correct the person above  who mention the book by Michael Chrichton it is Timeline rather than Time Machine.<br>  <br>  And it doesn't have to be scientifically sound unless it is a serious time travel story. If its for fun then you can use anything, remember Flux Capacitor that makes time travel possible in Back to the Future.<br>  <br>  So if you were to go for her father having made the time machine what was his occupation that could open him up to the idea of time travel, was he a scientist? you can do as you please, that's what is great about fiction. How's about her father was a watchmaker and after spending fifty years creating and repairing watches he suddenly had an insight into how time actually works and how to control it and so invented the Box, it is made entirely of cogs that move and keep a different time than normal, like being inside a big clock and you control time by the manner in which you have the cogs turn etc. Basically go wild, nothing wrong with far-fetched <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|mtXR5jz8aa	The second option reminds me of the Narnia stories.<br>  <br>  Maybe if you go with option 1, you could twist it a little.  I don't know if you were planning on having the father as a character, but maybe he dies or mysteriously disappears.  Then the main character finds old blueprints or notes or a map that the father left behind, which eventually leads to the time machine.|`|DnNkCF6Taa	If you go with number 2, you can take a thing from the movie Kate & Leopold where the man finds a time portal due to the mathematical calculation of time and weather... if you do something similar, instead of finding out where it would be of a bridge the MC can find the calculations in her father's items or something her grandfather had calculated and bought the piece of land where one is located, and built a storage shed around it....|`|y5bSUn6xaa	wakes up 1 day and finds herself in the past. she wonders around, finds a machine, and finds out its a time machine. this option can ge u to write about how she got into the past and all. good luck|`|YkI63LFZaa	maybe she falls in a well which is really a time/space vortex<br>  buys an enchanted watch from a gypsy antique store<br>  dream the event|`|a2tZF67Maa	1) has been done to death, 2) IE. Time Bandits? "its evil". How about taking something out of todays news, MC get hit by a truck that is hit by a train and gets knocked back in time, or global warming affects the brain and allows times travel, or MC is on the Atkins diet and the chemistry in the brain does it. Bad ideas I know but you get the idea, take something current and make it your own. I was always partial to the Teseract but I'm sure you get in trouble for using that one again.|`|z3b1DzlXaa	Being that it's a purely speculative idea, the mechanic for going back in time can be just about whatever you want it to be.  <br>  Things like Tesseracts and higher-dimensional phenomena, tears in the fabric of space-time, black holes, hyper-gravitational wells, and the like are all possibilities.<br>  Since the major issue seems to be locating the phenomenon in question, accident is in and of itself perfectly acceptable.  Indeed, since the whole idea is going back in time such findings need not be accidental at all.  For instance, the gateway that takes her back in time can be created or prepared by her actions in the past.  Thus, anything that simply seems an accident may very well turn out to be quite the opposite later on.  Just be sure to watch out for Paradoxes.<br>  The other thing that needs to be born in mind is that there is nothing new under the sun.  Taking a device for making believable time-travel and re-using it is perfectly acceptable.  After all, the idea of using a 'machine' to go back in time was done back when H G Wells first broke the ground.  If the plot device to get the character back in time is, in fact, just a device and not central to the plot, re-using one is about the equivalent of, say, having a protagonist with two dead parents raised by his aunt and uncle, or using a magic ring to travel to parallel dimensions.|`|iktuXTQTaa	There was a movie about that closet thing...<br>  <br>  Going back in time 1 year is just as belivable as 1 million years...|`|AA11878029	time travel to the past does not exist...You could read the Time machine by michael crichton...whom is the best at explaining the possibility.....but according to Stephen Hawkings,  you can only go to the future by space travel and where time movement is faster than the earths rotation then upon returning the date has only been a couple of days...something like that !!!
D9x1QSgiaa	I own the Canon EOS Rebel XSi, EOS 5D Mark II and the EOS 40D. The model XSi is an excellent beginner to intermediate model to learn photography with.  <br>  The "kit" package comes with an 18-55mm zoom lens. The camera has pop-up flash, 12.2 Megapixels, and shutter speeds up to 1/4000th, 100-1,600 ISO sensitivity, 7 auto exposure Scene modes, PLUS Shutter Priority, Aperature Priority and Programmed Exposure Modes and Manual. It also has a 3 inch LCD screen, 3.5 frames continous per second max., 9 point AF system, Live View Functioning and the ability to record photos in 3, 6 or 12 Megapixels PLUS numerous other great features found only on more expensive cameras. Wal-Mart is also selling them now for about $799. Sam's Club also has them for $729.<br>  <br>  I bought one of these 6 months ago and use it as my "back up" camera. I absolutely love it. I have gotten some fantastic photos with it and cannot praise it enough. I routinely enlarge my photos to make 8x10's and 11x14 size enlargements with no noticeable distortion or loss of detail in the pictures. <br>  <br>  It would be impractical for me to try to teach you a lesson in photography here, but I am including some useful websites for you to refer to in an attempt to learn more.<br>  <br>  I strongly recommend that ALL beginners buy a good book on digital photography AND take a class or two from a Vocational school or Community Education Center in your area. <br>  There are also MANY useful website that offer FREE education about digital photography. I suggest these for starters:<br>  <a href="http://www.tutorial9.net/category/photog..." rel="nofollow">http://www.tutorial9.net/category/photog...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.picturecorrect.com/photograph..." rel="nofollow">http://www.picturecorrect.com/photograph...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cameralabs.com/features/lates..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cameralabs.com/features/lates...</a> <br>  <a href="http://digital-photography-school.com/po..." rel="nofollow">http://digital-photography-school.com/po...</a><br>  <a href="http://theonlinephotographer.com/the_onl..." rel="nofollow">http://theonlinephotographer.com/the_onl...</a><br>  <br>  There are also numerous good "study at home" photography course which come with instructional DVD's or videos and books to help you.

No one will try to convince you to change from that.  <br>  <br>  First thing to do when you get the camera is to read the manual.  I know everyone will tell you that, but it is pretty important.  The XSi is a very good camera but you do know how to use it.  After you have gone through the manual, putting the XSi in Automatic mode will let you get started right away while you are learning how to use other modes (and you will want the flexibility of the other modes).<br>  <br>  While the manual is helpful, it doesn't go into the details.  It is a more basic "how to".  You may want to look at another book to introduce you to both the XSi and photography - something like this one:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-Digital-Rebel-450D-Companion/dp/0596520867/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1236524660&sr=1-9" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Canon-Digital-Rebe...</a>

Tqizcvuyaa	Alexander?s vision of Asia was that it ended just on the other side of India. Wanting to conquer the continent, he persuaded his men to march east. The Indian king Porus and his elephants fell to Alexander, but the weather and the mountains wore out his men. It soon became clear that Asia was larger than had been estimated. With his campaign suffering from ?mission drift,? Alexander succumbed to his men?s pleas and turned back. But he decided on a circuitous route: down India?s rivers to the ocean, then along the coast back to Persia. It was probably Alexander?s greatest mistake, as 15,000 of his men died of starvation or heat in the Gedrosan Desert -- more than all those he lost in battle. The journey may have taken its toll on Alexander as well. At a banquet back in Babylon, he drank excessively -- as usual -- then fell ill of a fever, most likely due to malaria. He died a few days later, just shy of his 33rd birthday|`|9233401496ab10d52d1644174696a803aa	I would say Alexander's greatest failure was the fact he had named no successor. After his death there was a constant battle over who should take control. It emerged that his kingdom and conquered territory split into 3 different powerful geographical polities. He did more than conquer as his influence (Greek) continues even to this day through laws, culture, and language. In every area he conquered you can still find some remnant of his existence. He was not called great until much later and not just for the area he conquered.|`|99399280e2e93e47c5b56b48ad0d3730aa	He was from Macedonia at that time Greece. He was a clever general who conquered countries as far as India. Also the Syrian Enpire.

79YQAbSRaa	I hated it as well. <br>  <br>  When I finish a book, especially ones that meant as much to me as the Harry Potter series, I don't want to be led through the rest of their lives.  I want to let my imagination fill in the blanks.  She left very few blanks to fill.<br>  <br>  However, I can understand why she ended the series that way.  She was ready to close Harry Potter back in his cupboard, so to speak.  If there wasn't an air of finality to his story, fans would never have let him rest.<br>  <br>  I believe it was her way of closing that chapter of her life as well as his.|`|IDtrNQ1vaa	well, it was disappointing. I would have liked it if she didn't write it. In every book the ending always left a note of mystery and I expected she'll do an open ending for the 7th book, but she had to do this soap-opera scene. It destroyed the image I had of the books.|`|HfG7EiG1aa	It's her story, she can do what she likes, and she obviously wanted to let the world know what happened to Harry.<br>  <br>  Personally, I liked it. Way better than just ending without anyone ever knowing what happened.|`|uq1GXvSdaa	i like the epilogue <br>  and most people like Harry and Ginny geting maried.|`|fbd64694a498c73d8b0c3ca90c37602aaa	You are right that the story does end in Dumbledore's office, but the epilogue is for people who want to know how JK saw the future of her creation.  If the Hogwarts' universe is now closed and no more stories will ever be written, then it is nothing more information for the extremely curious.  Should the universe ever be opened to other writers, then they have been given guidance as to how the future went for the three heroes.  A future story I had has been effectively eliminated although the past is still possible.  I'm curious about Molly Weasley.  After the battle, I have a feeling she was one all-star beater in her youth|`|Kokqm6rTaa	At first I though the ending was a little fanfiction-ish. DH had a lot of character deaths and bloodshed, so when the book ended with an epilogue as happy with that I was upset. Plus I was still morning over Snape when I read it! <br>  <br>  I reread the book a few weeks after and realized I really do like the epilogue. It was a good way to end the story. I think after every thing Harry has been through he deserves a happy ending! I can understand why some wouldn't like it though because that was my initial reaction. I do enjoy it now though.|`|MWPl41Eeaa	Yeah, it's way too sweet for me, too. There are some redeeming places, though.<br>  <br>  Like Harry's reluctance to meet Percy.<br>  <br>  "Our Teddy! Teddy Lupin! Snogging our Victoire! Our cousin!"<br>  <br>  Oh, and the whole "You're named after two headmasters of Hogwarts.

Fnbz8q9Vaa	Dear Bethany, your question is, why are you feeling annoyed about a) criticism and b) sweeping unspecific negative dismissal in 'rubbish' as far as I can tell. You have had lots and lots of positive  feedback about your poetry on this site. You know your poetry is good, I'm sure! Anyone who says a poem is 'rubbish' isn't really someone whose views you ought to worry about. Your poetry is not rubbish that's clear. Yes it can be improved quite extensively (do you think your favourite poets were mistresses/masters of their craft at 13? Have you checked out what they were writing at that age?) and there are a few very sensible responses here giving you details of how those improvements could be made. <br>  Having a drive to write poetry is common among younger people and yours stand out above the usual contributions. Most people 'give up' writing poetry afIter adolescence! If you feel driven to continue and to 'be' a poet, that is not going to be an easy path for your life - a deeply meaningful and important path but not easy. Getting published is hard, making money is hard - but not impossible. Stick with it. Read poetry - read read read! you will learn just as much if not more about how to craft your poetry from reading other peoples than from writing your own.<br>  People's comments matter to you because a) you're young and sensitive and b) you're human.<br>   keep writing!|`|JYBz24Dyaa	your links are not working|`|Z4QbQt3Xaa	OK your files are readable now; I see some of the problems.<br>  You need to count syllables, in order to establish rythm.<br>  All of your lines are very inconsistant & disjointed.<br>  <br>  You sound very immature & emotionally defencive about this.<br>  If you genuinely want to learn to improve, you must accept criticism.<br>  Yes, saying 'it's rubbish' is not very helpful.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you can talk to your English teacher about your poetry.<br>  Obviously, if you have to explain your images, they are not working.<br>  They may be meaningful to you, but they don't communicate.<br>  Try reading some good examples of poetry at the library.|`|SPvkz1kQaa	I have read all of your poems, my favourite is The Water Loom. I don't know that much about poetry, but they all seem good. As you said, the messages and meanings weren't that clear but I don't think that matters as long as the poems are enjoyable for readers and as long as you enjoy writing them.<br>  Sorry I couldn't be more help and good luck with the rest of your writing!<br>  <br>  Lucy|`|B1LkXUKvaa	There's nothing wrong with it. i don't like it, but that is just me.Your right. you NEVER get answers in the poetry section. at least not helpful ones.|`|7e9bce7df6b13d448cd20f1bff3d3cf3aa	Bethany, I cannot open the site where your poems are unfortunately.<br>  <br>  All I can say is; poetry is a personal creation. It is what you make it. If you feel that you are creating a sense of feeling, thought or wonder for your audience, you are doing the right job. <br>  <br>  Choosing whether to use metaphors or similes in the 'right' places should be kind of subconscious, not something you decide to put in because you 'have to'. You are the creator. It is the English academics that strip a poem down and analyse it to see where these language devices lie. This does not mean that you have to build a poem to construct one that they like!!!<br>  <br>  At 13, you sound more knowledgeable and mature than your average teenager in terms of expression but cannot take things personally. Do not take criticism to heart!! Your poems are yours, not mine and certainly not anyone elses. As long as they convey what you what them to, to the extent you want to  and with the intention you want to get them across, you are creating good poetry.<br>  <br>  Keep going and understand that you don't really know ho is responding the your poems do you?|`|GW2i2qqUaa	I am sure your poems are fine. I will read them. Read Rilke's Letters to a Young Poet. It is a romantic book to read on a sunny or not so sunny day. Only eighty eight pages or so depending on which edition you get. Writing is a journey. Great writers cannot be formed and writing will always be a lonely walk. A lonely job. We may in fact hate writing. A sincere loathing for it. But we don't have a choice. It is our calling despite how we try to avoid it. But a good start is to read Rilke's Letters. Email me. I am old. Quite older than you but I have no interest in anything other than discussing writing.|`|I917Iztaaa	One Mans Rubbish Is Another Mans Treasure.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't take nasty comments to heart. Some people enjoy slating other peoples work. If they're not backing up a statement such as "It's rubbish" with any reason why, then the chances are they haven't taken the time to read the poem, and are just taking a cheap pop at you.<br>   Let the criticisms roll off you as easy as those artistic lines roll out from your thoughts.

EyAAFfaMaa	First of all, I'd like to point out that celebs are only about 7% of actors. Acting is something you should only do if you absolutely love. Someone once said, actors do what they do because they'd be miserable with anything else. So, keep that in mind.<br>  <br>  What do you mean "getting an agency"? If you have no experience or training so far, I don't think it'd be easy to get an audition with an agency. What's the agency? If it's JRP,John Casablancas,or Barbizon THEY'RE SCAMS! Or if those are your classes, they are SCAMS! <br>  <br>  Anyway, NO! NEVER EVER lie on your resume/interview. A) They will notice, they're not dumb and B)they can easily IMDB you or call the director/teachers and check it out. Then you'll have a bad rep and no one will hire you. People talk to each other. If you have an audition, and you nail it, it won't matter. <br>  <br>  You're sixteen, which is like the toughest time to start, because if you aren't established, most people won't hire you. Unless, you can play 12. It's labor laws, ect. They will usually hire an 18 year old to play younger because they can work longer and don't have to go to school. <br>  So, if an agent feels like they won't make money off of you, they won't sign you. <br>  Here's my advice, get some experience first, NOT an agent. Do some community theater, take acting classes(which you already are),do school plays,build up your resume. (Take a dance/voice class even, this can be added to your special skills.) Anyway, after you have a few credits on the resume, and some classes, and skills of some kind, try reading ross reports for castings, and try to get small (or lead, that'd be GREAT) in some low-budget movies, or student films, and indies. THEN, when you've participated in some on-camera work, some theater,some classes and such, send your headshot and resume to agencies who accept solicited mail. You can submit to casting directors, too, but this will usually end up in the trash if it is a big-budget feature. You won't get into the BIG FIVE or B LIST agencies (most likely), unless you're a semi-celeb or really established. Most of them don't accept submissions, so be sure to check. <br>  <br>  Take any legit agency you can (there's books and websites with lists, but be cautious.) , make sure they don't ask you for any up-front fees except the usual 10-15% of what you make. Then get work and be happy. YAY :-) <br>  <br>  Oh, and you will need a headshot, make sure it's good (and print it on quality paper!) because a casting director can be picky. He can say no to your submission based on the quality of the paper, he has MANY other options and he can afford to throw your picture in the trash. <br>  <br>  Where do you live? Make sure you live in a market, where there is work, otherwise this is all pointless. It's best if you live near LA or NY.|`|4saIcqO3aa	i would not lie about who you are and your experience <br>  the good thing is that even if you haven't been in any plays you have (are) taking drama classes which is great!<br>  i wouldn't go straight to an agent though 'cause they take a while and they don't except you unless they think that they will make money off of you. (long story e-mail me if you want more) <br>  first i would get experience then apply for an agent <br>  it can be hard to get one though since children agents don't like kids that are "old" (old being over 11 isn't that offal?) it may take a while but if it is something that you really want it should be worth it. <br>  i hope that this helps you <br>  love <br>  ~i am me~|`|18d9aa70c53578f18caa307002ccab93aa	No, don't like be truthful.

You're a creature living a life in a society that is controlled by a government and a world that has its priorities in a knot.

We are all responsible for EVERY experience in our lives, the best and the worst. Every thought we think is creating our future. Each one of us creates our experiences by the thoughts we think and the words we speak.  Beliefs are ideas and thoughts that we accept as truth--what we think about ourselves and the world becomes true for us.  What we choose to believe can expand and enrich our own world--Each day can be exciting and enriching or sorrowful and limiting. It is YOUR choice.  <br>       No matter what the problem is, your experiences are outer effects of inner thoughts. Thoughts produce a feeling and we buy into that feeling; however, if you don't have the thought then you won't have the feeling. Change the thought and the feeling must go. A persons ego or comfort zone if you will, plays tricks on us.  It sounds like you want to give up because it may be more comfortable to withdraw then to move outside that comfort zone.  A person withdraws from circumstances and may tend to blame things on the circumstance or others rather than take responsibility for our experiences. If we all took responsibility in our lives then there would be noone to blame. Whatever is happening out there is only a "mirror" of our own inner thinking. Destiny is what you "choose" it to be.

I know that's hard--sometimes I do better than others.  Just try to remember that you don't always have to react at all.  Sometimes you have the choice to just bite your tongue and walk away until you feel more calm and better in control of yourself to deal with the situation.  <br>  <br>  Take baby steps to try to gain a little more control of your life.  It's easy to throw your hands up in the air when things start getting out of your control and just give up on everything, but make sure you aren't giving up on the things you really *can* take control of.  Make sure you are eating right, getting enough sleep (or as much as possible), drinking plenty of water, and taking any medications you're on as prescribed.  <br>  <br>  Also, my "get out of the rut" worst-case-scenario habit is to get out of bed every day, even if only for a few minutes.  Don't forget to breathe.  Don't drink or use any recreational drugs, because they may make you feel better momentarily, but the effect is fleeting and usually has a worse rebound effect than what you felt initially.  Leave the house at least once a day, even if it's only to walk to the mailbox.<br>  <br>  Returning to your original question, though, don't give your power to anyone or any situation.  You're a good person--you've been on this site long enough for all of us to know that.  You don't want to let anyone or anything else have enough control over you personally to turn you into someone that you won't like.

You must not allow to accept what is happening in your life as ''destiny'' you also have to try to be strong enough to go and seek help, accept help and work towards making your life better.. Fate has some impact on our lives, but you still have control over a lot of things in your life.. by not just letting fate let you be defeated, if something really bad happened, go and seek help from others, friends, and don't punish yourself and don't accuse yourself.. by saying that only god can judge you now...if you want to talk about it.. you know that I am a contact, you can email me, just send me an email when you look me up and I will respond by proper email..

aLNLl482aa	I am  a HUGE fan of Georgette Heyer!<br>  <br>  You can't really go wrong but my two favourites and these come out consistently in the top 10 of all her fans are<br>  <br>  These Old Shades and the sequel Devils Cub. You can read the sequel in isolation though!<br>  <br>  I also like The Grand Sophy.<br>  <br>  I'm sooooo jealous I wish I was 17 and reading them for the first time!|`|kfOpbbCyaa	You can't go wrong with any of her books. Her books are a pleasure to read.<br>  <br>  This site <a href="http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/h/georgette-heyer/" rel="nofollow">http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/h/geor...</a> has a list of the books she wrote.<br>  <br>  If you enjoy books set in the Regency period in England, you may enjoy The Nonesuch, Regency Buck and The Corinthian. They were all excellent.<br>  <br>  If you enjoy historical novels from around Medieval times, The Conqueror and My Lord John were very good. I also enjoyed Simon the Coldheart.<br>  <br>  Royal Escape was another good historical novel about the escape of Charles II from Cromwell's forces.<br>  <br>  Georgette Heyer also wrote some interesting mysteries.<br>  <br>  Whatever books you purchase, I hope you enjoy them.|`|XAAF7R23aa	sprig muslin, cousin kate, the black moth, i have all of her books, it does not really matter which you read first they are all good, cotillion is good too, i started reading them in about 1958 and get them all out about every 5 years and read them again, they are timeless, enjoy,|`|57IryITnaa	Almost any of them are going to be excellent to start with.  There's a great website you can check out with all kinds of links:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://georgette-heyer.com/" rel="nofollow">http://georgette-heyer.com/</a><br>  <br>  If you like comedy, then I would suggest The Grand Sophy, Cotillion, and The Talisman Ring, or Faro's Daughter. The first two are Regency, the third and fourth are Georgian.  The Nonesuch is a wonderful story of a snobby girl who gets shown the truth about herself--although she refuses to believe it.  <br>  <br>  If you want more of a mystery/adventure with your romance, then I would say The Toll-Gate, The Unknown Ajax, and either The Talisman Ring or The Corinthian.   <br>  <br>  Good psychological dramas are Cousin Kate and A Civil Contract, and for readable history, my favorites are Regency Buck which is an excellent picture of Regency life, ranging from snuff, horse racing, prizefighting, and cockfights), and The Spanish Bride, a true story about the war and Sir Harry Smith, who became a general.  You'll be surprised by how much romance is in that one.  <br>  <br>  The mysteries are fun, I'm reading Death in the Stocks again now, and enjoying it just as much this time as ever.<br>  <br>  Whichever ones you pick, you'll read them over several times through the years.  (Just get The Grand Sophy for sure, you won't be sorry!)|`|0KXCAm0baa	Which are you most interested in?

OR it can be about Literary Theories/Criticisms that'll help you learn how to read literature, because you can come up with different interpretations by using different theories such as Marxist Lit Theory, Reader-Response theory, Psychoanalytic theory etc.

shVgCizBaa	How was Blackbeard captured?Later during the battle, while Teach was loading his pistol he finally died from blood loss. Maynard then cut off his head and hung it from his bow. ” -------------------------------------   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackbeard" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackbeard</a>     Death -------he went to Bath, North Carolina, where he finally accepted a pardon under the royal Act of Grace. He then went off to Ocracoke Inlet in the last of his four vessels to enjoy his loot.<br>  <br>  Having accepted a pardon, Teach had apparently retired from piracy. Nevertheless, Governor Alexander Spotswood of Virginia became concerned that the notorious freebooter lived nearby. Spotswood decided to eliminate Blackbeard, even though he lived outside of Spotswood's jurisdiction. <br>  Blackbeard and Lieutenant MaynardBlackbeard operated in many coastal waters; it was difficult for larger vessels to engage him in battle. Two smaller hired sloops were therefore put under the command of Lieutenant Robert Maynard, with instructions from Spotswood to hunt down and destroy Blackbeard, offering a reward of ￡100, and smaller sums for the lesser crew members.<br>  <br>  Maynard sailed from James River on November 11, 1718, in command of thirty men from HMS Pearl, and twenty-five men and a midshipman of HMS Lyme, and in command of the hired sloops, the Ranger and Jane (temporarily commissioned as His Majesty's Ships to avoid accusations of piracy themselves). Maynard found the pirates anchored in a North Carolina inlet on the inner side of Ocracoke Island, on the evening of November 21.[8]<br>  <br>  Eventually, Maynard's sloops were able to float freely again, and he began to row towards Blackbeard, since the wind was not strong enough at the time for setting sail. When they came upon Blackbeard's Adventure, they were hit with a devastating broadside attack. Midshipman Hyde, captain of the smaller Jane, was killed along with six other men. Ten men were also wounded in the surprise attack. The sloop fell astern and was little help in the following action. Maynard continued his pursuit in Ranger, managing to blast the Adventure's rigging, forcing it ashore. Maynard ordered many of his crew into the holds and readied to be boarded. As his ship approached, Blackbeard saw the mostly empty decks, assumed it was safe to board, and did so with ten men. Blackbeard's assault was preceded by several grenades made by filling rum bottles with gunpowder.  <br>  “ Maynard and Teach themselves begun the fight with their swords, Maynard making a thrust, the point of his sword against Teach's cartridge box, and bent it to the hilt. Teach broke the guard of it, and wounded Maynard's fingers but did not disable him, whereupon he jumped back and threw away his sword and fired his pistol which wounded Teach. Abraham Demelt struck in between them with his sword and cut Teach's face; in the interim both companies engaged in Maynard's sloop. Later during the battle, while Teach was loading his pistol he finally died from blood loss. Maynard then cut off his head and hung it from his bow. ” <br>  <br>  Despite the best efforts of the pirates (including a desperate plan to blow up the Adventure), Teach was killed, and the battle ended. Teach was reportedly shot five times and stabbed more than twenty times before he died and was decapitated. Legends about his death immediately sprang up, including the oft-repeated claim that Teach's headless body, after being thrown overboard, swam between 2 and 7 times around the Adventure before sinking. Teach's head was placed as a trophy on the bowsprit of the ship (it was also required by Maynard to claim his prize when he returned home). After the sheer terror of the battle with the pirates, and the wounds that the crew received, Maynard still only acquired his meager prize of ￡100 from Spotswood. Teach's head was placed on a pike or pole on the north shore of the Hampton River in Virginia, at a place now called Teach's Point, as a warning to other sailors who thought of taking up a life of piracy.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackbeard" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackbeard</a>|`|hmTVcteoaa	Blackbeard was not captured.  He was killed in battle after being shot 16 times.<br>  <br>  I remember reading about that in a book about famous pirates when I was a kid and was always very impressed by how many shots it took to finally kill Blackbeard!  I can't remember the name of the book though, but you could probably find something about that pretty easily on Google.
z4Yeofq8aa	My degree is in history and humanities and I specialised in the Victorian era although I did also study the renaissance and enlightenment.

I realise however that the OU isn't everyone's cup of tea but I found its courses to be of a very high standard.|`|7e9bce7df6b13d448cd20f1bff3d3cf3aa	Try Huddersfield or Salford.|`|VXcnq3zGaa	Look for a degree in British History if that's what you're most interested in.|`|09YWnp8paa	Most universities will offer a range of courses at BA and Hons, most in medieval or modern history (British that is) but I doubt if few would specialise in one particular era. That is not to say they wouldn't, but you would probably find that in a typical 3 year course, you would study a range of periods, or indeed themes, which is becoming popular nowadays. The best way is just to either go on the internet or, much better, go to your local reference library and have a look through all the prospectuses. I assume you live in the UK? Edgehill is very good, as is Keele, but as I graduated nearly 20 years ago (eek!) this is probably out of date now. Anyway, whatever you decide, you'll love it because it's the best subject there is! Good luck.

cR8UZdi1aa	It sounds like you would like polymer clay, look at your local hobby craft stores like Micheal's or JaAnn Fabrics, they carry polymer clay & all the tools needed. My favorite is "Sculpy" & They also carry "Fimo" & "Kato". It is an oven bake clay that anyone can use. From amateurs to professionals. It's easy to work with, non-toxic, bakes in your own oven & you can get it in all colors & even paint it after it's baked.  It bakes hard & is really durable. It's not "permanent" but will last a long time if you take care of it.<br>  <br>  You can also use different media with it like you said paper, fabric, etc. Glue them on after it's baked. They have Glue specifically for this clay, but you can actually use any glue. You can also re-bake it, for example if you did the main figure & baked it, if you wanted to add more clay to make the dress or a head piece, you can add more clay & re-bake. It's simple really.<br>  <br>  Tools are sold with it too, but I've used common things like spoons, butter knives, toothpicks work great, anything really works. For the armature AND for modeling the clay.<br>  <br>  They also sell "Paper Clay" in the same areas of these stores, which is really a nice medium to use, but for your ideas, I'd suggest "Sculpy".<br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|OouhYyyuaa	Have you heard of FIMO?

However, the Middle East and possibly parts of Europe, Asia and North America could suffer during World War 3. <br>  Step2After you have analyzed your location, decide if it is safe. If so, then stay put. If your current location is in a combatant nation, you may want to consider moving to a safer part of the globe. <br>  Step3Start preparing food storage, clean water and any other supplies you would need if life were disrupted by a massive war. You may not have electricity and the supermarkets could be closed. <br>  Step4Prepare a hiding place in a remote location, far from military bases, nuclear silos and large population centers. This will be your safe haven if war comes to a neighborhood near you. <br>  Step5Get some potassium iodide pills to help protect from radiation poisoning. Also try to create a bunker with plenty of shielding from radiation. <br>  Step6Try to learn the language of any of the victorious nations. If you think China will win World War 3, then learn some Mandarin. If you think Russia, then learn Russian. If you think the Anglo-American nations will win World War 3, then be sure to speak English. This will come in handy because if you can work as an interpreter for foreign powers, you will have guaranteed safety, work, and food. <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4770896_survive-world-war.html?ref=fuel&utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=ssp&utm_campaign=yssp_art" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4770896_survive-...</a>        --------Does anyone think that world war 3 is close approaching?<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080309101131AAckpFl">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>      ---------------               Surviving World War III                <a href="http://www.endtime.com/pdf/archives/ETM-2007-10-Surviving-WWIII.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.endtime.com/pdf/archives/ETM-...</a>                    Is Russia Preparing for World War III? <br>  <a href="http://www.secretsofsurvival.com/survival/is_russia_preparing_for_war.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.secretsofsurvival.com/surviva...</a>       WILL WE SURVIVE WORLD WAR III? <a href="http://www.newswithviews.com/Evensen/greg5.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newswithviews.com/Evensen/gre...</a>|`|QG6TlDGcaa	When the first atomic bomb was dropped there was some debate in the Allied scientific community as to whether it would work as intended, or whether it would work and incinerate the atmosphere at the same time.

I quit singing until I went to the Philippines and everyone sings there. They also expected me to sing. I couldn't believe it but the people there finally coaxed me into singing.

yV6mPFG5aa	In lyrical dancing you use your body to tell a story to a song.  You have to be fully devoted to it because it takes lots of work.  Even though there are many forms of this dance some people like me put some sign language with their moves.  To do this dance I would say you would need a outfit first of all to perform and to practice in, a leotard, footless tights, dance shoes or you could perform bare foot.  Also to throw in a little effects gloves would be nice too.  When practicing you may want to record yourself on tape and watch later to make sure that your movements are where you want them to be.  Hope this helped.|`|mb1CZfuEaa	Lyrical is a type of dance when you tell a story through dance, it is a mixture of ballet and jazz. I really enjoy it because it is faster than ballet but not too fast.

iNXqiDIYaa	E.L. Konigsburg's writing has been migrating in style and subject matter; her latest work. Silent to the Bone, is ample proof of that. It's also proof that she can write anything she wants to. It is an excellent and intense book that explores family, friendship, love, and lies with Konigsburg's accustomed skill and intelligence.<br>  The main character and narrator is Connor. Branwell, Connor's best friend, has been accused of seriously injuring his baby sister Nikki, and has been unable to speak since she was hurt. Connor visits Branwell in the detention center, where he realizes that he must first learn to communicate with his friend and then learn what really happened to Nikki. Connor is a very intelligent kid, but still real and fully-fleshed. In fact, the main characters of this book - Connor, Branwell, the au pair, and Connor's sister - are all very well developed, as are the relationships between them.<br>  <br>  Although the subject is rather grim, the book itself is not. The primary focus is actually Connor's detective work, the ways in which he goes about discovering what happened both in Branwell's house and in Branwell's head. The plot is gripping and believeable, and the truths - about Branwell's sister, but many others as well - unfold naturally, without calling attention to themselves. Although Konigsburg rarely makes blatent statements about emotions or complex relationships - people mostly don't, after all - she makes everything clear to the reader. The family relationships, for example, are for the most part background, but so perfectly drawn that they are easy to see and understand. <br>  <br>  Although it's very different from her early works, like From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, Silent to the Bone is every bit as good. It's certainly better than The View from Saturday, which was a Newbery book. I would suggest that it is more of a YA book, for a slightly older audience than the age range suggests. A nine-year-old could read and enjoy this, but he'd have to be a fairly mature one. <br>  <br>  SIAS: Average boy uses wits, compassion, and help from sister to uncover the truth, protect the helpless, and save the day.

Have the students pull the leaves with their stems in the fall and press them between paper, under heavy books or bricks. When the leaves are dry and flattened retreive them and soak them in water.

So I don't think you could have started a PETA group around the campfire in those prehistoric times.<br>  <br>  Then came the realization that animals could be domesticated and/or befriended for things humans needed (e.g. horses for travel, oxen for pulling things, elephants for stampeding in battle, dogs/wolves for early alert systems or even protection, etc.).<br>  <br>  I think even those early domesticators appreciated that animals had feelings and sentiments.  But it wasn't until we started realizing that even PLANTS have feelings that we started to appreciate how all living creatures and entities should have rights to life or survival on this planet such that we should not allow anything to go extinct or suffer pain unnecessarily at the hands of mankind.<br>  <br>  To the extent that the Renaissance was an awakening and a rethinking of everything, I know for example that some found it fascinating to consider animal's feelings and potential usefulness to mankind in even more creative ways.  For example, it became fashionable in some areas during the Renaissance for people to walk their LOBSTERS on a leash like a dog.  How's that for rethinking our relationship with non-human creatures?<br>  <br>  As we became more civilized and starting living in smaller spaces with crowding in the cities, there still became the need for identification with some kind of pet for companionship to the point they invented the "Pet Rock", which was really a joke, but it made some people feel good having something to "take care of" and talk about like a child, even if it was only sitting on a desk or shelf at home or the office.<br>  <br>  Witness also the advent of electronic pets like Furbies which kids loved, due to the need to have something to care for like a child, interact with, and brag about to friends.<br>  <br>  Overall, our dependence on animals lessened over time with the advent of things like the train (the "Iron Horse") and the automobile (the "horseless carriage").  But we are all still creatures of the earth and have a need for some kind of companionship with other "living things" around us, even if we create it electronically, leading towards the popularization of robots.<br>  <br>  While not a totally chronological and anthropological accounting of the evolution of man's relationship with beasts, I hope this provides a few insights that may help with your research.

It came to close hand to hand fighting, but eventuall y the regiment was over whelmed by the numerous North Koreans. They were taken prisoner and forced marched to a POW camp some hundred miles away. This became known as the battle of the Imjin River. It resulted in 2 VCs being awarded for Bravery. One went to the Colonel of the Regiment, Colonel Carne, and the other to Private Bill Speakman.

y8bFwXZEaa	Everything has measurements: tables, trees, etc. Words are measured in terms of their identities. A measurement of concepts means "of a relationship--a quantitative relationship established by means of a standard that serves as a unit....It is important to note that..the choice of a given standard is optional [but] The facts established by measurement will be the same, regardless of the particular standard used."<br>  <br>  Up to that point it simply means you can measure in feet or meters, quids or cents, horsepower or cubic inches, and the results will still pertain to the same object and will "translate" just as words in language translate. You say "free enterprise," the French say "laissez faire." The standard of which language to use is optional, but both phrases mean the same thing.<br>  <br>  Now, three things can all contain the measurement of "length," but to understand the concept "length" you must let go of the actual measurements themselves. <br>  <br>  "If a child considers a match, a pencil and a stick...the DIFFERENCE [in length] is one of measurement [but] to form the concept 'length' the child's mind retains the attribute [of a thing he will come to call "length"] and omits the particular measurements."<br>  <br>  Each of the 3 items has a measurement, but the actual length of each is not necessary to know in order to form the concept "length" to describe the fact that each can be measured.<br>  <br>  So we drop the measurements and retain the attribute "length."|`|9adfd40573a5f8454356f9c074106d83aa	Much of what Ayn Rand attacks is based on her not liking a popular fairly wacky philosophy called General Semantics. [There is a realistic technical study of language called General Semantics and a wacky extension of that that gets strange.]    Rand, when she says we must believe in A and Not A as Aristotle did, is attacking the idea that people perceive words in different ways and we should allow for those different perceptions in understanding confrontations between people.<br>    She wanted Absolutes and decided this should be done by dividing the entire world into two part choices and choosing between them " 'Simple,' she said."    And of course it is - you can divide anything into "This" and "Not This"  or "Me" and "Not Me"    The problem is that while simple, it is often not very useful in the real world and may lead to things like "Us/Them - Kill them before they kill us."  as in Iraq and the War on Drugs.

d04ae6ff8e12fe20d1db30d24b4bc806aa	Absolutely. No question but that this statement is true. Consider Immanuel Kant.<br>  <br>  Kant's deontological ethics posited that the duty of all ethical conduct was absolute and non-negotiable. To lie was wrong -- PERIOD, so far as Kant was concerned.<br>  <br>  He believed that under no circumstances was anyone to lie. Thus, if someone came up to you and asked where a friend was, and you knew this person intended to kill your friend, Kant would say you have an absolute moral obligation to tell the truth and give up your friend's location.<br>  <br>  Kant was a brilliant man; but at times he had no common sense.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. Cheers.|`|HORACAnlaa	Yes it's true in two different senses. One philosophy always starts with the accepted common opinions, thought to be wise, of the non-philosophical when it attempts to find truth. That's what the Socratic Method is all about. Two, philosophy can only establish it's truth by understanding the senses we all share in common. Knowledge must be judged before the bar of objective reality, which is only experienced by the senses we hold in common. So therefore we must say philosophy is a child of common sense in two different ways that we mean by common sense, commonsense as wise common opinion and as the senses common to us all.|`|spYpsixUaa	A philosophy which directly contradicts the Real World (or the observations of our senses) and makes no effort to explain that contradiction cannot be based on Common Sense.  I offer the example of Parmenides (in the famous dialogue by Plato), who claimed that all reality was unchanging and static--he even claimed that Logic itself supported his claim.  However, Socrates argued that our senses and observations proved his philosophy incorrect, or his philosophy proved our senses and observations were lies.  The result of such contradictory sophism was that our senses were horribly awry or that something was wrong with Logic itself.  My interpretation of the Parmenidean was is that it is a proof of the errors which Logic alone can provide when one ignores its relationship to the senses and observations.|`|XvO4iLk0aa	G Here is a description of the commonest and most profound sense.<br>  Life Decryption Key-Shortest<br>  By Generalist 02-09<br>  <br>   Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.<br>  The first decision is; do we want to control our lives, or rely on outside forces. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects.<br>  <br>  This document is intended for those who want to control their lives and accept that causes produce effects. The question naturally occurs, “What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?” The causes must be based on what is pragmatically verifiable, yet universally true. <br>  <br>  Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the Japanese words Myoho.  Why use Japanese words? The concept originated in Japan and can’t be expressed as well in another language.<br>  <br>  Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.<br>  <br>  Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is. <br>  <br>  The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life. <br>  <br>  This formulation serves as a life decryption key.<br>  Add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This, spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together, focuses the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy. It works best when conducted together with other people, who are also trying to have great lives by training their mind-heart-bodies by using the LDK. <br>  <br>  Source:<br>  <a href="http://www.sgi-usa.org." rel="nofollow">http://www.sgi-usa.org.</a> Or<br>  <a href="http://www.SGI.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.SGI.org</a> <br>   Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key.

Most of the questions I've ever answered on here stem from my vast knowledge of common sense.  I am an intelligent woman, but intelligence needs to be interspersed with common sense and I am lucky that I was blessed with both.<br>  <br>  Philosophy = Common sense.|`|77ZVd5hyaa	I agree because everything we do requires some about of using our common sense. Unfortunately many people lack that necessary skill these days.|`|gLp7pvPnaa	The double negative implies the following: -<br>  1. The opposite to...Philosophy is nothing if filled with common sense.<br>  2. The opposite to...Philosophy is something if not filled with common sense.<br>  3. The same as.......Philosophy is something if filled with common sense.<br>  <br>  My dictionary defines common sense as good sense and sound judgement in practical matters. Most philosophers seem to pay little heed to common sense preferring to complicate practical questions by redefining the question. In general they are pedantic to the extreme, but perhaps the greater truth demands this approach. The everyday practical way is usually sufficient for most of us, even a philosopher on an off day. What do I know, I'm no philosopher. Was it a puzzle?|`|AA11530144	The quote is far to abstract for a concise answer, as an empiricrist ,I would agree but there are other types of philosophy that are far as Im concerned are in the same boat as religions, the more odd the theories the greater their kudos not very sensible but man will be man|`|y8bFwXZEaa	Apparently it was Aristotle who coined the term "common sense" to mean that quality of the mind that was available to all.

shVgCizBaa	i want to find history of baton?     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Baton_Rouge" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_...</a>               French period (1699-1763)<br>  Baton Rouge dates back to 1699, when French explorer Sieur d'Iberville leading an exploration party up the Mississippi River saw a reddish cypress pole festooned with bloody animals and fish that marked the boundary between Houma and Bayou Goula tribal hunting grounds. They called the tree "le baton rouge," or red stick. The native name for the site had been Istrouma. From evidence found along the Mississippi, Comite, and Amite rivers, and in three native mounds remaining in the city, archaeologists have been able to date habitation of the Baton Rouge area to 8000 B.C. The French city of Baton Rouge became one of the more prominent settlements of New France, but never surpassed the importance of nearby New Orleans.<br>  <br>   Acadian settlement (1755)<br>  In the Great Expulsion of 1755, around 11,000 Acadians were deported from Acadia under the direction of British colonial officers and New England legislators and militia; many settled in an area near Baton Rouge that would come to be known as Louisiana. Eventually these settlers began calling themselves Cajuns, a name descending from a mis-pronunciation of the original name Acadians. (French: Acadiens) maintained a separate culture, encompassing distinct clothing, music, food, and dedication to catholic faith, that has since immeasurably enriched the Baton Rouge area.<br>  British period (1763-1779)<br>  On Feb. 10, 1763, the Treaty of Paris was signed, whereby France gave all its territory in North America to Britain and Spain. Spain ended up with New Orleans and all land west of the Mississippi. Britain ended up with all land east of the Mississippi, except for New Orleans. Baton Rouge, now part of the newly-created British colony of West Florida, suddenly had strategic significance as the southwest-most corner of British North America.<br>  <br>  The British built Fort New Richmond just south of the eventual site of the LSU campus Pentagon Barracks (in downtown Baton Rouge), and began plans for the development of a town. Land grants were given, resulting in an influx of the first settlers.<br>  <br>  When the older British colonies on the Atlantic coast of North America rebelled in 1776, the newer colony of West Florida, lacking a history of local government and distrustful of the potentially hostile Spanish nearby, remained loyal to the British crown.<br>  <br>  Spanish statesman and soldier Bernardo de Galvez defeated the British colonial forces at Manchac, Baton Rouge, and Natchez in 1779.In 1778, France declared war on Britain, and in 1779, Spain followed suit. That same year, Spanish Governor Don Bernardo de Galvez led a militia of nearly 1,400 spanish soldiers and a small contingent of rebellious British colonials from New Orleans to Baton Rouge, capturing Fort New Richmond. The Battle of Baton Rouge would stand as the only land-based military battle of the American Revolution to be fought outside of the original thirteen colonies. The fort was renamed Fort San Carlos, and the Spanish gained control of Baton Rouge. Galvez subsequently captured Mobile in 1780 and Pensacola in 1781, thus ending the British presence on the Gulf Coast.<br>   Spanish period (1779-1810)<br>  See also: Battle of Baton Rouge (1779)<br>  A colony of Pennsylvania German farmers settled to the south of town, having moved north to high ground from their original settlement on Bayou Manchac after a series of floods in the 1780s. Known locally as "Dutch Highlanders" ("Dutch" being a corruption of the German "Deutsch"), they settled along a line of bluffs that served as barrier to the Mississippi River flood plain. Historic Highland Road, located in the heart of present day Baton Rouge, was originally established as a supply road for the indigo and cotton plantations of these early settlers. Two major roads in the area Essen Lane and Siegen Lane were both named after cities in Germany. The Kleinpeter and Staring families were amongst the most prominent of the early German families in the area, and have remained active in local business affairs ever since.<br>   The Republic of West Florida (1810)<br>   <br>  The Bonnie Blue Flag of West FloridaAs a result of the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, Spanish West Florida found itself almost entirely surrounded by the United States and its possessions. The Spanish Fort at Baton Rouge became the only non-American post on the Mississippi River.<br>  <br>  Several of the inhabitants of West Florida began to have conventions to plan a rebellion, among them Fulwar Skipwith, a Baton Rouge native. At least one of these conventions was held in a house on a street in the city that has since been renamed Convention St. (in honor of the rebel conventions). On September 23, 1810, the rebels overcame the Spanish garrison at Baton Rouge, and unfurled the flag of the new Republic of West Florida, known as the Bonnie Blue Flag. The flag had a single white star on a blue field.

Ia8pJg1iaa	Well it would help if you have a starting point, what is the dance about. is it abstract or narrative. Say you picked a dance about mirrors then it would be a good idea for two people dancing in reflective unison. etc.<br>  Use the music to improvise and create movements and gestures. I don't think it has to be a solo, you can have a group like I have.
OAi71Eqwaa	pointe is crazy fun but your feet like bleed! at least mine did i wore the shoes for a bout 2 hours (to start to break them in and stuff) and my toes bleed and they still hurt! and lyrical is soo fun to its graceful and stuff. but i pick piont|`|f5eOqIo6aa	It really just depends on your personality, either way you could become professional. You should ask your mom if you could take pointe for one month and lyrical for another. Then you could chose. Pointe can be really pretty and you can do some lyrical with it later on, but if you want to be able to feel the ground as you dance and let your moves flow through you, you should totally go for lyrical|`|mb1CZfuEaa	It really depends on what you want. If you like emotional dance and dont want as much pain choose lyrical...if you really like pointe choose pointe|`|Xj2LO9iHaa	Pointe, it is the basis of most dance forms.|`|kHZMhWiEaa	Well, if you plan on becoming a professional dancer choose Pointe, but I personally like lyrical better. Pointe is better for your technique so if you plan on dancing for a long time I would choose that then in the future if you want to take lyrical and Pointe you'll be good at both but if you’re just dancing for fun then choose the one you like better.|`|VXsRflQraa	Pick pointe because then you will always be able to do it.  with ballet, you can always go back to lyrical because ballet is the basis.  If you pick lyrical, you will probably not be able to go back en pointe without lots of work later on.  good luck in your choice!  :)|`|3cL7XphAaa	Pointe because there you get so much more taught to you. Lyrical comes natrually if you know ballet and pointe|`|Mkh6V7CXaa	i think you should keep pointe because it has taken so much work to get and dont give it up
hmTVcteoaa	He conquered lots of tribes in what became Gaul (later France) and Spain.  This added large areas to the Roman Empire.<br>  <br>  Julius Caesar also tried to conquer Britain, but he wasn't very successful.  Later Roman rulers conquered Britain up to Hadrian's Wall, the wall the Roman's built that now forms and approximate boundary between England and Scotland.|`|pI5jKfmaaa	Military career<br>  Main article: Military career of Julius Caesar<br>  Historians place the generalship of Caesar as one of the greatest military strategists and tacticians who ever lived, along with Alexander the Great, Sun Tzu, Hannibal, Genghis Khan, and Napoleon Bonaparte. Caesar suffered occasional tactical defeats, such as Battle of Gergovia during the Gallic War and the Battle of Dyrrhachium during the Civil War. However, his tactical brilliance was highlighted by such feats as his circumvallation of Alesia during the Gallic War, the rout of Pompey's numerically superior forces at Pharsalus during the Civil War, and the complete destruction of Pharnaces' army at Battle of Zela.<br>  <br>  Caesar's successful campaigning in any terrain and under all weather conditions owes much to the strict but fair discipline of his legionaries, whose admiration and devotion to him were proverbial due to his promotion of those of skill over those of nobility. Caesar's infantry and cavalry were first rate, and he made heavy use of formidable Roman artillery and his army's superlative engineering abilities. There was also the legendary speed with which he manoeuvred his troops; Caesar's army sometimes marched as many as 40 miles (64 km) a day. His Commentaries on the Gallic Wars describe how, during the siege of one Gallic city built on a very steep and high plateau, his engineers tunnelled through solid rock, found the source of the spring from which the town was drawing its water supply, and diverted it to the use of the army. The town, cut off from their water supply, capitulated at once. Caesar also used a cipher system to communicate with his generals which has now come to be known as the Caesar cipher.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caesar#Military_career" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Caes...</a>
ceBTTCPwaa	To Kill a Mockingbird is a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Harper Lee published in 1960. It was instantly successful and has become a classic of modern American fiction. The novel is loosely based on the author's observations of her family and neighbors, as well as on an event that occurred near her hometown in 1936, when she was 10 years old.<br>  <br>  The novel is renowned for its warmth and humor, despite dealing with serious issues of rape and racial inequality. The narrator's father, Atticus Finch, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. One critic explained the novel's impact by writing, "In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its protagonist, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism."<br>  <br>  These links should give you detailed and excellent answers to this and other questions :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/To_Kill_a_Mockin..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/To_Kill_a_Mockin...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tkm/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tkm/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/tokillamocking..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/tokillamocking...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.awerty.com/tokill2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.awerty.com/tokill2.html</a>|`|xJoMSkI5aa	Lee did not set her novel in contemporary late 1950s society, however. This novel instead takes place a few decades earlier, before the changes and conflicts of the civil rights era. The book is set in the time period of Lee’s own youth, and many critics have pointed out the similarities between her and Scout, and her childhood friend, Truman Capote, and Dill. Lee herself has said that she did not intend the book to be an autobiography. She simply wrote what she knew.<br>  <br>  From Shmoop/To Kill A Mockingbird|`|IsozKRNeaa	They book is set in the 1930's, which is around the time of the Great Depression.

q57P8uJbaa	The map is the author's memories of immigrants set on a time scale.  This chronology, this history is pink, because it represents human flesh, human beings.  She remembers those families from the first year, then the little boy, the little girl from the next.  She remembers their arrivals and their departures.  The immigrants are allowed to stay a while, but then told to move on by the town.  The author identifies with being a member of the town, and wishes to forget her own involvement in constantly sending these people away, constantly being a member of the good who remain silent.

G0wo8ueLaa	Dear Criss,<br>  <br>  Congratulations on doing your research on something as important as your higher education.<br>  <br>  I believe that if you read and read (and read some more!) you do not need to formally study writing to be a wonderful writer (although you can study it if you want to, of course).  While some authors do study creative writing or English Literature, the majority of the world's most renowned and beloved authors did not study these subjects.  Some go on to become teachers - that is a common path - or they studied and worked in a profession that was related to the subject of their fictional writing (history, art, mythology, classics, law, etc.).<br>  <br>  There is no single path for an author, and no subject you study will necessarily make you more successful a writer than another.  Honestly, reading extensively and having a profound love of the written word are the two greatest gifts you can give yourself as a budding writer.<br>  <br>  That being said - I do think it's wonderful you're taking your education so seriously.  If you really want to study writing, I seem to remember that of the schools I looked at, Dartmouth had a good writing program (Dr. Seuss went there!), as does Middlebury College - both excellent schools on the East Coast.  I think I've heard that UCLA in California has a good writing department as well.<br>  <br>  I do encourage you to think about the kind of writing you want to do - fantasy, science fiction, historical novels, etc.) and consider pursuing your studies in that field.  For instance, I majored in psychology, and that has helped me to understand the inner workings of my characters and their motivations.  You can always major in writing and minor in a subject, or vice-versa.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  May your writing career be illustrious and great fun!|`|a2tZF67Maa	My dream too! William and Mary in Va. is top notch. Or the University of Vermont. Dartmouth is another great one. But the best I've found (and it is hard to believe, but do yoursef a favor and at least take a look) is The University of Iowa ( check out items on their writers workshop too). It may just be that amazing school your looking for. I hadn't checked Seton Hall, but I will take a look now.|`|fI4LqMVMaa	Johns Hopkins University has a world renowned writing seminars program.  Hopkins is in Maryland.|`|dcE0km8oaa	If you want to study writing, you need to study in a state that will influence you...like in San Francisco, California. It is so beautiful out there. The weather is so clear and beautiful, and the vibe and everything about it is perfect. Don't go to L.A, a lot of phonies are there and its just too glamourous. sure UCLA is cool and all, but you would not get that OOMPH for your writing.. Portland, Oregon is a nice place too...quiet and peacefull...it will give you time to think. I don't know if Chicago, Illinois will be nice, but I hear it is really pretty. Massachusetts is really pretty. Study in a state that will motivate you. Personally, I think San Francisco has it all.

FAY7ZuECaa	I wouldn't worry about her but if she starts to give you problems or gives a threat to hurt then you can tell your coach. But the best thing to do is just ignore her and do the best you can at cheer leading. I don't personal like it because there aren't very many girls that join just for fun they just join for school looks and to be popular. My sister joined because she loved it but she quit because all the girls that didn't care always brought her down. So the next year when she didn't join the coach came personal to her classroom and asked her why she didn't join that year when my sister told her why she was shocked and the coach said that she was the best on the team and she wanted back. My sister didn't join the team but when these two particular girls ( these are the girls that teased her) heard that she didn't try out they pratcially ran to the gym to tryout they hadn't tried out and they didn't want to be on the team when they knew that my sister was better.<br>  So if she starts to give you threats then that's when you tell the coach but other than that you can't do much. If she calls you a bad name they tell your coach and talk about it. Make sure you have good behavior too because if she throws a punch or slap at you don't hit back or you both could get kicked off the team. My best advice is to ignore her and move on she is probably jeoalous.|`|8S2icURfaa	Yeah, get used to almost all cheerleaders being brats. Just ignore her.|`|FBnKUp7iaa	Yeah. I had that problem too!. Just show your coach the txt and tell her that you tried out to get better at cheering. and you wanted it to be fun. ya know.<br>  Hope I helped :D|`|f5eOqIo6aa	Ouch first answer. So anyway, she is partially right, but it's your choice if you want to end up like that. Just ignore her and keep practicing and prove to yourself, not anybody else, that you deserve to be on that team. Good luck :D|`|dHYVE076aa	Get used to bratty cheerleaders. Don't worry, over time you will become exactly like them.|`|OAi71Eqwaa	sorry but you cant really do anything about it. or if u want todo somthing you can show the coach the text and do that|`|WPL5nDivaa	not to seem rude but this doesnt seem like a huge deal to me...<br>  first off, why does she have ur phone number if u hate each other?<br>  this is obviously her venting because her friend didnt make it and you did, if it continues during practice the coach will notice, but if she doesnt tell her and maybe the coach can work it out<br>  try to ignore her, hopefully your cheerleading team is big enough that you wont have to talk to her or be around her much. if its not just be decent, but avoid her as much as possible<br>  dont make such a big deal out of this|`|ZML7VdGBaa	just practice really extra hard and make captain and show her!

hmTVcteoaa	Wikipedia will help as far as exact dates go.  <br>  <br>  The Spanish initially captured Cuzco (the Incan capital city) and most of the Incan Empire, in the mid-1500s.  The survivors of the Incan royal family moved their capital to Vilcabamba, a city further away that the Spanish had a harder time reaching.  They remained based in Vilcabamba, ruling what was left of their Empire for about 40 more years. <br>  <br>  Towards the end the Spanish tried to make them into a vassal-state, which the Incas at first seemed to accept and then later rebelled against.  This led to a violent crack-down on the part of the Spanish.<br>  <br>  The Incan Empire was destroyed once Vilcabamba was destroyed (I think this was in the 1580s, but I can't remember specifically). <br>  <br>  About 80 years later a descendent of the Incan royal family, Tupac Amaru, led a rebellion against the Spanish.  They captured and executed him.  After that the Incas effectively ceased to exist as a free political movement.  <br>  <br>  As an unrelated, although interesting, side note the late rapper, Tupac, is named after Tupac Amaru|`|NPtz1Y4Taa	At the time that the Spanish arrived at the lands of the Inca Empire in 1528, the empire spanned a considerable distance.[1] Extending southward from the Ancas Maya (meaning Blue River) which is now known as the Patia River in southern Colombia to the Maule River in Chile, and eastward from the Pacific Ocean to the edge of the Amazonian jungles,the empire covered some of the most mountainous terrain on earth. In less than a century the empire had grown in extent from about 155,000 square miles in 1448, to 380,000 square miles (or about the size of the eastern seaboard of the United States) in 1528, just before the arrival of the Spaniards. This vast area of land varied greatly in both culture and in climate. Because of the greatly varying cultures and geography, many areas of the empire were left under local leaders, who were watched and monitored by Inca officials. However, under the administrative mechanisms established by the Incas, all parts of the empire answered to, and were ultimately under the direct control of, the Emperor.[2] Scholars estimate that the population of the Inca Empire probably numbered over 16,000,000.[3]<br>  <br>  Some scholars believe that while the Spanish conquest was undoubtedly the proximate cause of the collapse of the Inca Empire, it may very well have been past its peak and in the process of decline.

Then Lord Capulet and Lord Montague get in a fight.|`|8bWIL8RXaa	yes the opening scene shows you the fight and hate between the two families ..(If your having a hard time with the play try watching Leonardo DiCaprio's version of romeo and juliet and try a book called no fear Shakespeare it will help)
w5C0XrNOaa	Neanderthals were classified as "hunter/gatherers". They ate whatever they could kill or find. Any wild animal that you can probably think of, from field mice to mammoths, were potential meals for them. As far as gathering, that would include wild fruits, nuts, berries etc. as well as insects, worms, grubs etc. There is also evidence that they ate wild grains, roots, greens and that sort of thing. Hope that helps you get started.
HORACAnlaa	If you mean universal truths the answer is yes. The hall mark of something being true is that anyone can discover it. The method of finding truth is reason and it is processed by all humans, in greatly varying degrees.|`|YmtNel5haa	One of the definitions for democratic:3: relating to, appealing to, or available to the broad masses of the people. a definition of truth:<br>  6. an obvious or accepted fact; truism; platitude. <br>  In these definitions, one could believe truth democratic.<br>  of course I am a bit skeptical, but well that is just me.|`|tsjLHXzUaa	What do you mean?  Democracy and being open to all are not the same thing... perhaps you dont mean them to be?<br>  <br>  Democracy should be open to everyone... and as a general rule it is... a democratic decision is not democratic if only a few cast a vote.  The fact is, not everyone does vote... but they dont by choice.<br>  <br>  Truth?  I think everyone has a moral right to the truth.  I dont believe anyone can justify lies or deceptions.  I think we each have a right to know the truth in any situation, particularly those that effect us. I dont think others can decide what truths are important to us. I think we all have a right to a free education.<br>  <br>  But is truth democratic?  No.  People dont decide on truth. The truth is an objective thing.  It doesnt change, it is non circumstantial, non subjective, non individual... it just is, cold hard truth.|`|y8bFwXZEaa	The only "democratically" chosen "truth"--and I use that word with some trepidation here--is Muslim Shura (not to be confused with Sharia.)

KwLdWMj1aa	Wow. That's all I can say. I'm an author. Just. Wow.|`|2hQFdy08aa	Haha, nice!  Sounds like a good start to an exciting adventure.  You lapse into "telling" the story as oppose to showing sometimes (describing the torments, getting into some history...) which I think would serve you better later.|`|9M6UrsYTaa	good story, sounds interesting.<br>  <br>  I think it needs the detail that you have put in it. <br>  Its a good story, and you should probably go into the past now and say about how this girl got the First book and what has happened up til the present. <br>  <br>  Dont listen to your first answerer he's nasty. Seriously.|`|75cz9e5Kaa	I think it's really good except the 'Hairy Forest'..<br>  The name just seems a little weak<br>  Good though (Y)|`|GW2i2qqUaa	I would suggest reading Rilke's Letters to a Young Poet and Stephen King's On Writing. Not because you need help at all. Your writing is fine. It is about the why to write and what writing is and isn't. Nothing whimsical. Concrete. Writing will always be a lonely job. But we will always have to carry our egos with us.|`|K5uoaetaaa	This is the sort of thing I wrote when I was twelve, although I suspect my grammar was better.  Poor grammar, repetitive and dull lexis, and mixed tenses detract from the (fairly poor) content.  So, no, I would not carry on reading.|`|z3b1DzlXaa	There are a good number of grammatical issues, some small, others a bit larger, that make reading this rather difficult.  <br>  One thing that needs stating right off bat, 'hot enough to fry eggs on the sidewalk' is a cliche.  While you can certainly get away with using it, opening a story on one tends to put a bad taste in the reader's mouth.<br>  Your paragraphs are very well-structured; they keep to a single idea without wandering too much off topic.  The only major problem is that you linger on certain pieces of information for too long, which slows down the story's flow considerably.  <br>  The fourth paragraph, describing the Torments, does not need to be there.  One of the fundamental rules of writing is to show, instead of tell.  As it is there doesn't seem to be any indication of why a physical description and a run-down of the Torments' powers should be there, especially since we do not even know if she is being chased by them.  The physical description can come when we see them, and the powers don't need to be described at all; once one of those things touches a character and incapacitates them with pain, the creatures' abilities will be understood.<br>  <br>  Here's the first paragraph with the revisions I'd make.  Being that I'm only an armature writer myself, these should be taken with a grain of salt.<br>  It was hot, so hot that one could hear a faint sizzling sound with every step from the rubber soles of their shoes melting and sticking to the pavement.  Listless branches hung over the ground, too tired to dance in the hot, exhausted breeze.  Definitely not a day for strenuous activity.  Unless, of course, you wanted to pass out under the relentless heat...<br>  Two of the sentences were cut, partly because they conveyed no new information (they were simply ways of reiterating how hot it was) and partly because the imagery they used, that of sitting inside relaxing, didn't mesh well with the rest of the passage, or the idea of running from a nightmarish creature.  Most of the rest of the edits were for the sake of flow.<br>  Hope this was of some assistance.|`|G3BVemgwaa	sure i'd keep reading! it sounds pretty good, a lot like harry potter but different. I was a big fan of harry potter so i find this kind of writing interesting. Good Work so far!!!|`|1DySEaRraa	From what I'm aware of prologues they are not suppose to have anything to do with the main character unless its ten years in the past or a flash of something later in the story. Don't tell the story in the prologue. <br>  <br>  I have to agree that there is to much detail. <br>  I got confused too. I thought this was modern but suddenly these creatures are chasing her. If someone looked out their window and saw a girl being chased by some creatures they would probably save her.

I would say that he's the only guy for me and I have always loved him. <br>  <br>  If I just stared at him, then next I would say, "Wow, this is really surprising. I would never have thought that you would feel this way about me."<br>  <br>  Good luck with your story.

THonpuVGaa	I have some notes copied from an old book which say...<br>  Shakespeare and other sonnetteers often varied from the strict iambic pattern, to give greater naturalness to the sonnet.  He also used at times a double rhyme (me- not sure what this means exactly unless they mean an end rhyme and an internal rhyme) to break the monotonous flow of single rhymes.|`|nE5eqyWeaa	Variations are welcome in most forms.<br>  <br>  SONNET <br>  A fixed form consisting of fourteen lines of 5-foot iambic verse. In the English or Shakespearean sonnet, the lines are grouped in three quatrains (with six alternating rhymes) followed by a detached rhymed couplet which is usually epigrammatic. In the original Italian form, such as Longfellow's " Divina Commedia," the fourteen lines are divided into an octave of two rhyme-sounds arranged abba abba and a sestet of two additional rhyme sounds which may be variously arranged. This latter form tends to divide the thought into two opposing or complementary phases of the same idea.|`|HkXYGAOdaa	Yes, every line should be strictly iambic pentameter.|`|AA11267193	You said the "S" word.<br>  The answer is yes. I've been fighting with one for days and my iambics are shameful.

Mig6O93Naa	Hmm. Well, You have to get serious about what  you are doing and stop thinking that you look foolish. You are so self conscious, I am surprised you were cast. If the situation in the skit is sad enough you will cry if you concentrate on being the character and stop thinking about anything else.|`|B8Gwxo1laa	Once you get used to the situation, you should naturally calm down and relax. Concentrate on what you are doing, the role you're playing, and act accordingly. If you Really get into the part, the emotions will just come to you, and you build on them. Don't worry about crying real tears,  pain and sorrow can be reflected without them, and they might just come naturally.<br>  Relax!!|`|seDE2gBXaa	for crying keep your eyes open for a really long time or just get an onion for before your crying scene. What also works is just don't open your eyes very wide and tighten your power lip to give the illusion that you are crying without actually crying. <br>  For calming down I suggest deep breaths in a place that is silent if possible. Just focus all your energy on nothing. Its kinda like meditating at one level.|`|ZiYLLh6Iaa	if your after tears get onions, sounds stupid but it works, or put water drops in your eyes which makes tears. to calm yourself down, if your looking at someone that keeps putting you off, A) ignore them or B) look inbetween their eyes, i find this easier as you usually get put off when looking in thei eyes.|`|8bWIL8RXaa	OKay i was in the same skit same person!!!!! first of all you go girl !!

pmpmQhDOaa	When you eat food do you put salt and pepper on it. Or may be add sugar?? When you cook do you add garlic or onion powder, maybe celery salt or basil. Its because spices add additional flavors and bring new senses to our pallate. When you have variety in you life..going to art shows, seeing a different part of the country. Trying a different style of jewelry, you are adding a new sense to your life and becoming aware of new dimensions to life. Like all work and no play made jack a dull boy, adding variety to life makes life enjoyable.|`|AA10809857	To every large extend. Depends on what is on your mind and what you want to achieve|`|bxlYleZkaa	In every extent. For instance I have three cats. All three are quite different in every way. I have fish and chips in my car on a Friday lunchtime and a vodka and lime on Saturday night. I desire neither at any other time. For instance I have both husband and lovers who together satisfy all my needs, however I have neither the time nor the inclination to seek any more than I have already got. They are therefore both the variety and the extent of it.|`|AA10729675	To the extent it does not harm anyone.  Too much pepper has killed the poor Lisa, long time ago, an abused child.  Her picture was in the newspapers.  It was 22 or 23 years ago.  Her step-father forced her to eat a lot of red peppers and she died.<br>  Too much of anything ruins the equilibrium.  so the extent to variety and to spice of life is equilibrium.|`|tsjLHXzUaa	To every extent.<br>  <br>  The question is whether or not spicing your life is the moral thing to do... some spices and certain quantities of them should simply not be used... like any good recipe.<br>  <br>  What is also sad is that some people are afraid of "blandness", consistency... but even that has its virtues... if youve never tried it then it is also a unique variety...|`|nBERj16Eaa	Dear Time,<br>  <br>  Variety is the spice of life<br>  only to the extent that life itself has consistent structure and predictable cycle.<br>  <br>  <br>  The main dish is "the given."<br>  Variety is only a spice that can be ADDED to what is the given.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  Jim|`|PvCngXKIaa	I think in this context variety means doing lots of things to make life more interesting. It's the experimenting (doing new things) with our  lives that creates the spice we all seek to make an otherwise mundane and routine existence interesting and worthwhile.|`|GedjSOI9aa	There is no extent.  The reason that you might think that there is an extent because people say that it is weird.
HkXYGAOdaa	They are both very expressive and poignant poems.<br>  <br>  If I may, I would critique by revisions below<br>  <br>  <br>  These lyrical rhymes that consume my time,<br>  mean so much to me-my cries for help and<br>  my sighs of Relief-are no match for the <br>  feelings that always defeat: frustration, <br>  Anger, Depression, anxiety, more.<br>  <br>  Tear my gentle heart like an open sore.<br>  My tears flow out While anger stays in, <br>  as I commit the wrong ultimate sin:<br>  Laugh, smile, dance; but don't let them see you frown.<br>  <br>  <br>  I just use line breaks, formed two quatrain with 10 syllables each, and punctuation to make it flow easier while holding your readers' attention and focus.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The guilt makes me tremor.<br>  The regret makes me cry.<br>  Often time I sit and <br>  wonder; ask myself why.<br>  <br>  Why did I do this or<br>  why, why did I not talk.<br>  Where did I go so wrong,<br>  and what should I do now.<br>  <br>  Why am I not perfect, <br>  longing, I want to be<br>  Why did not I go, <br>  and set right, myself free<br>  <br>  The people who love me,<br>  they would have cared a lot.<br>  Yet, I don't ever think,<br>  they know I'm really scared.<br>  <br>  Is this the way life goes? <br>  Letting your emotions go? <br>  <br>  <br>  2 quatrain and a couplet, each line contains 6 syllables, and punctuation to again make it flow, and line breaks to hold your readers' attention and focus.<br>  <br>  The above are just suggestions.  Your poems are great also the way you have them now.|`|nE5eqyWeaa	Poem 1:<br>  Too many abstract words that need weight, an image to let me know how to qualify them, mean so much, crys (cries) for help, sighs of Relief, feelings that defeat, Frustration, Anger, Depression, and more...<br>  My tears, anger (again), ultimate sin, Laugh, Smile, Dance...I'm assuming the capped words are to add emphasis but the work as a whole needs specifics to pull it from the hole of the mundane. How do you get the reader to feel these, touch these, taste these?<br>  <br>  <br>  Poem 2: Same problems.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|D97UWCBUaa	I'm liking it.... <br>  in ur 2nd poem line3 take out the 2nd "and" so it just reads<br>  "sometimes i sit and wonder, ask my self why"<br>  just my opinion, but they are good|`|zKAtOueQaa	There really good.<br>  <br>  My favorite is the first one :L|`|kaK9nprbaa	Again, straight to the point and clearly written.  Two plusses in my book.  I like them Jenn and find it extremely hard to criticize what you have written here, having felt the same way more than I care to remember. It's hard to criticize something that hits close to the heart...all I can do is relate.  Your writing style and subjects chosen in these and another, remind me of an online friend that I have conversed with on another site.  Her poems are similar in style and in content.  The only thing I would suggest and I'll admit it's petty, is to go through and change some capitalization and punctuation.  The only other thing I'd say is to maybe change, "Sometimes I sit and wonder and ask myself why" to "Sometimes I sit and wonder, asking myself why"  See, I told you it'd be petty! lol  I apologize for suggesting the corrections but, I've just been editing the heck out of a book I've been working on and now it tends to spill over into everything I read.  Overall, I really like it.  Keep up the writing, you definitely have a knack.
hmTVcteoaa	Ghettos were not just in the Holocaust.  They existed in Europe for centuries befoe Adolf Hitler was even born.  <br>  <br>  A ghetto was a part of a city where Jewish people were forced to live.  The Christian majority in Europe did not want Jewish people living amonst them, so they forced them to live only in specific districts.  This generally caused problems over time as populations expanded but were still constricted to the same small district in the city.<br>  <br>  In WW2 the Nazis shut the Jews completely inside ghettos, like in Warsaw, and either wouldn't let them leave at all, used them as slave labor, or both.  In the more famous case of the Warsaw Ghetto, the Jews revolted against the Nazis and fought them in the ghetto, but were ultimately killed by the Nazis anyway.|`|qMYhZSZdaa	A ghetto is described as a "portion of a city in which members of a minority group live especially because of social, legal, or economic pressure."<br>  The first ghetto was in Venice in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries  where the Jews were forced to live.<br>  The most infamous ones were the Ghettos in Germany and the conquered countries were jews were forced to live until taken to Concentration Camps<br>  <br>  Wikipedia has more details if you need|`|vhlORK4Waa	Dictionary definition<br>  <br>  1. (n.) an impoverished, neglected, or otherwise disadvantaged residential area of a city, usually troubled by a disproportionately large amount of crime<br>  2. (adj.) urban; of or relating to (inner) city life<br>  3. (adj.) poor; of or relating to the poor life<br>  4. (adj.) jury-rigged, improvised, or home-made (usually with extremely cheap or sub-standard components), yet still deserving of an odd sense of respect from ghetto dwellers and non-ghetto dwellers alike<br>  <br>  Prior to WWII Jewish ghettos in Europe existed because Jews were viewed as cultural minorities due to their non-Christian beliefs in a Renaissance Christian environment.As a result, Jews were placed under strict regulations throughout many European cities.The character of ghettos has varied through times. In some cases, the ghetto was a Jewish quarter with a relatively affluent population (for instance the Jewish ghetto in Venice).In other cases, ghettos were places of terrible poverty and during periods of population growth, ghettos had narrow streets and tall, crowded houses. Residents had their own justice system. Around the ghetto stood walls that, during pogroms, were closed from inside to protect the community, but from the outside during Christmas, Pesach, and Easter Week to prevent the Jews from leaving during those times.<br>  <br>  In the 19th century, Jewish ghettos were progressively abolished, and their walls demolished, following the ideals of the French Revolution. The Nazis re-instituted Jewish ghettos before and during World War II in Eastern Europe.<br>  <br>  In WWII  During World War II ghettos were established by the German Nazis to confine Jews and sometimes Gypsies into tightly packed areas of the cities of Eastern Europe turning them into de-facto concentration camps. Though the common usage is ghetto the Nazis most often referred to the areas in documents and signage at their entrances as 'Jüdischer Wohnbezirk' or 'Wohngebiet der Juden' (German), both translate as Jewish Quarter.<br>  <br>  Starting in 1939, the German Nazis began to systematically move Polish Jews into designated areas of large Polish cities. The first ghetto at Piotrków Trybunalski was established in October 1939, the one in Tuliszkow was established in December 1939 or January 1940, followed by the first large scale ghetto, the ?ód? Ghetto in April 1940 and the Warsaw Ghetto in October with many other ghettos established throughout 1940 and 1941. Many Ghettos were walled off or enclosed with barbed wire. In the case of sealed ghettos, any Jew found leaving them was shot. The Warsaw Ghetto was the largest ghetto in Nazi occupied Europe, with 380,000 people and the ?ód? Ghetto, the second largest, holding about 160,000.<br>  <br>  The situation in the ghettos was brutal. In Warsaw, 30 percent of the population was forced to live in 2.4 percent of the city's area, a density of 9.2 people per room. In the ghetto of Odrzywó?, 700 people lived in an area previously occupied by five families, between 12 and 30 to each small room. The Jews were not allowed out of the ghetto, so they had to rely on food supplied by the Nazis: in Warsaw this was 253 calories (1,060 kJ) per Jew, compared to 669 calories (2,800 kJ) per Pole and 2,613 calories (10,940 kJ) per German. With crowded living conditions, starvation diets, and little sanitation (in the ?ód? Ghetto 95 percent of apartments had no sanitation, piped water or sewers) hundreds of thousands of Jews died of disease and starvation.<br>  <br>  In 1942, the Germans began Operation Reinhard, the systematic deportation to extermination camps during the Holocaust. The authorities deported Jews from everywhere in Europe to the ghettos of the East, or directly to the extermination camps — almost 300,000 people were deported from the Warsaw Ghetto alone to Treblinka over the course of 52 days. In some of the Ghettos the local resistance organisations started Ghetto uprisings. None were successful, and the Jewish populations of the ghettos were almost entirely killed.<br>  <br>  Halcon|`|KhiWV0Q0aa	lol people try to hard to answer these questions .<br>  <br>  a ghetto was an area where they put jewish people, it was unclean and crammed full.  a]now its used for poor areas that artn nothing like the jewis getthos because the jews were forced to live there unlike poor white and black people who thinks its hard to be in a ghetto heheh<br>  simple as ;)|`|zWZe6wA0aa	When the Nazi's took over the towns where Jews lived, the rounded them up into places called Ghettos, where they then had to live and ultimately, die in concentration camps.

Being the single parent of a four year old girl has given him a reason to recover and paramedic school has given him the means. A disciplinary transfer has displaced him from his native Manhattan into the secluded mountains of northern Pennsylvania. His fears of boredom are quickly replaced by a struggle for survival. When Rob realizes that a traffic accident victim was actually murdered he enlists the help of Deputy Coroner Anna Drake. As the two investigate they discover that the crime of the city has its roots in the beautiful mountains. They become targets and race to stop the killer before more of their informants, or they and their families die.|`|oo1bOj9caa	Jean M. Auel, Clan of the cave bear and the three sequels to that.<br>  Although this story takes place roughly 35,000 years ago, its cast of characters could easily slide into any modern tale. The members of the Neanderthal clan, ruled by traditions and taboos, find themselves challenged by an outsider,  a girl called Ayla found in the woods, who represents the physically modern Cro-Magnons. And as Ayla begins to grow and mature, her natural tendencies emerge, putting her in the middle of a brutal and dangerous power struggle.|`|F7EhEYSYaa	Please don't read Twilight<br>  I enjoyed <br>  The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas<br>  The Wizard Heir series- Heres the site.<br>  <a href="http://www.cindachima.com/Wizard%20Heir/Wizard%20Heir.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cindachima.com/Wizard%20Heir/...</a><br>  <br>  I HIGHLY recommend this, because you've read all the books I love, and Its the next big thing.

y8bFwXZEaa	Considering that philosophy deals with grammar and syntax, the syntax in your sentence proves it:<br>  <br>  If there is something "you know" as indicated by the last two words, then you have knowledge.<br>  <br>  Since you admit to having knowledge, how can you not know you have what you admit to having?<br>  <br>  This is a good basic question of epistemology, and obviously it threw off the answerers above me, because they all wrote from the subjective viewpoint instead of the objectivity of your syntax.|`|spYpsixUaa	1.  Nudge, nudge.  Wink, wink.  Say no more!<br>  2.  How else?  There is only one way to know, and that's to be right.<br>  3.

If you claim to know something, and happen to be wrong, how do you know that what you know is right?  How does one prove one's own knowledge?  Wikipedia has an entry for the Famous Duck Test, but the Famous Desk Test (which doesn't really disprove Solipsism) is to be found nowhere else but here on Yahoo Answers!|`|3tz4GyIaaa	cuz it just seems soo right!|`|FATyhyZ2aa	Thru 1-6 of my senses. - Like I know I had a baby because I had sex, watched my abdomen grow, felt movement, had labor,  gave birth, held the baby still connected to me, watched the placenta exit with cord & then raised child. - So I know I am a Mom.|`|7cyqgJQnaa	I dont know usually, I only know If i have taken the time to come to the conclusion that what I assume is actually true, and a safe assumption|`|dDprsKZYaa	I don't know, I just do.|`|BVf2eAWnaa	I know that I have knowledge of something because I am aware of it, but I can't know that what I know is the truth.
z4Yeofq8aa	No they weren't. The Nazis bear sole responsibility. Even if the allies had bombed concentration camps to try and allow inmates to escape the Germans would still have continued with their attempted genocide.|`|V60mZea1aa	Yes.<br>  If the allies had allowed Hitler to snatch the part of Poland ( formerly German territory) before the Russians took it, there would have been no WWII and no holocaust for Jews and for German and English and other innocent citizens!|`|a7b60e3673e24805f578c862bda4fb45aa	As nice as it would be to blame them, no.  Nobody was really "to blame".  Social pressures were to blame.  Unemployment was to blame.  The times were to blame.  It could happen in a month in North America with the Mexicans catching it just as it is happening in Africa in a few different places now.  It is happening in Israel now.  It happened in Spain, called The Inquisition.  It happened in the Americas when the Europeans came and slaughtered the First Peoples.  One group blames another for all their woes and starts a pogram.  Call it mob psychology.  Call it xenophobia.  Call it what you will, but nobody was to blame.  The allies did the right thing to stop it in Germany.  The world is doing the wrong thing by standing by and watching it happen in Africa and Israel.

qgs155HNaa	Not George Washington, at least not specifically.  He was speaking in debate on the ratification of the Constitution, and as a radical libertarian he favored a weak executive.

pKQQiqazaa	i twirled rifle for about 5 years and yes, it is hard, but with all things, the more you practice, the better you will become. It definitely takes a lot of practice and hard work, especially the more difficult tosses and tricks. However, not many people do it and I think it would be great to have more people trying! and no, small hands and the like wont make a difference. If it gives you an estimate, i practiced about.... 4 hours a day from 3-5 days a week during high school. <br>  <br>  good luck!!!!|`|mb1CZfuEaa	my friend does rifle and she picked it up right away but it just depends on how fast you learn and what your good at learning...she has tried to teach me and one other person and its not too hard i just don't have the patience for it
gLp7pvPnaa	Beauty is a smile on a pretty girls face, a butterfly spreading its wings, dappled light in heady scented woods, and songbirds calling in the stillness of day. Nature makes its beauty felt in so many ways.|`|FATyhyZ2aa	I felt it when I had to make a choice that disappointed my 30 y.o. ward.  She had been sheltered from disappointment in a false reality of life, but I chose to be honest with her.  I told her that I was sorry I could not keep a promise b/c my body was sick.  I didn't think that her 58 IQ would let  her understand.  She smiled so sweetly and said, "That's okay Miss Barns.  Sometimes I can help you too.  I can be YOUR guardian & take care of you.  I'm a good helper."<br>  <br>  My eyes were open not only to her ability for compassion; to me, but also that in sheltering her from wants, she had been denied the gift of giving & being needed.  <br>  <br>  We all need that.  That's why some of us come to this site.   Just a quick fix of being able to help someone.<br>  <br>  But hearing this from a place of innocence was a thing of beauty for me.|`|yYYY4F5Taa	Beauty is subjective. It is everywhere- in the flowers in my garden, in the singing of birds in our Singapore Cherry tree, in the smile and cry of a baby,in a well-dressed person, in a soft spoken individual, in a clean road, in music etc. etc.|`|Rd3Mj3O9aa	thats just something the "beautiful people" say to make others jelous.|`|pmpmQhDOaa	Have you ever heard someone say they felt beautiful? That is a reaction to an emotion. They put on make up new clothes someone complimented them and they "felt" beautiful. If you ever look up at the sky and saw beauty it is the emotion of something bigger and awe inspiring around you. If you hear someone say : that person is beautiful inside...it is because that person is generally kind and loving because they have an emotional need to nurture and give. But if you want to really know about feeling beauty i think a person to ask would be someone who is blind. they can only experience beauty through emotion and feelings, unlike those blessed with vision but are often too blind to see beauty all around us.|`|AA11564934	I have felt  a reaction to beauty, but in english we don't use the word beauty like an emotion.|`|07fd7ea1dbff60f8707ba40041258bc9aa	Beauty is determined by many factors, however most of them are from external attraction.

Action with a cause and effect.  <br>  sometimes, people think that Karma is only the effect.<br>  Capitalism is a completely different topic.<br>  Karma, or action is everywhere and cannot be violated.  An action cannot be violated.  <br>  Capitalism, on the other hand can be violated if you like the term "violated' by socialism.  <br>  Karma is a Sanskrit term, often used in a religious context.<br>  Nowadays we use it all the time wihout knowing what it really means.<br>  The Indo-European root *kr- is th base expressing action.|`|spYpsixUaa	Um, no!
