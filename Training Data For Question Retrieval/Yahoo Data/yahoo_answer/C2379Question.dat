Do you think that maths and science should be given more points on the ucas tariff?       Personally, I disagree completly with the article. I take English literature, History and Philosophy A level and I don't take them because they're "easy" but because they are subjects that interest me and I'm good at them. Yes I believe that if I took maths and science I wouldn't be able to secure a good place in university but that's because I find them dull and would be unmotivated. The professors quoted seem to think that the only intelligent people in the world are scientists and mathematicians, what about the world's brilliant writers and their English degrees?

I'm a junior and my cumulative GPA thus far is 3.1 My class rank is just barely in the lower half. This is pretty much because I slack a lot and have a habit of blowing off homework, etc. Anyway, my GPA for this year will be around a 4 (weighted) and will thus bring my GPA up a bit. I have decent extracurriculars- I'm Opinions Editor of the HS newspaper this year and I'll be Editor-in-Chief next year- and my PSAT score is 222, so I have a shot at National Merit. My dad works for Siemens so I can probably be a National Merit Scholar and get several thousand a year in financial assistance if I do become a NMF. I'm taking my SATs on March 14th and have done similarly to my PSAT scores on practice tests.   My question is this: Is a 3.3-3.4, coupled with Editor-in-Chief and a good SAT score, enough to get me into:   - Northwestern University   - New York University   - University of Southern California   - University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill   - University of Missouri - Columbia

20090128112329AAC42yh	Education & Reference;Primary & Secondary Education	How do I go about getting a  kid kicked out of Kindergarten?	I volunteer in a kindergarten classroom and there is one boy in the class that could make me tear my hair out!  This kid, "Tommy" is trouble.  Every day he seems to get citations (notes home) for his behavior and it's halfway through the schoolyear and none of the diciplinary measures of the school (timeout, loss of recess, principal's office, etc) have done anything to curb his behavior.  He is not ADHD, but probably the product of some very apathetic parents who never should have reproduced.  I've seen him push kids into the faucet while they get a drink of water, trip kids deliberately, throw pencils at kids, pretend to "stab" others with handfuls of scissors and pencils, make menacing gestures to other students, use foul language, and a plethora of rude comments, snappy reamarks, and vicious lie telling.   I am fearful for the safety of my own child and the rest of the kids.  I don't want my son's elementary school experience to be marred by this kid. And I fear It's only a matter of time before his actions really hurt someone.  I don't want to wait around for that "what if".  I live in California, what and how would you express your concern about him (even though he hasn't hurt your child) to a point where he could get transferred out.  I don't want to see this violent child in my son's classrooms in the future.

My extremely gifted child has been shy all of her life. I just don't know what to do.       She says she wants to figure things out on her own, and taht she will   come out of it when she's ready, but I know she should of been fine by now,      Mind you, it is not and cannot be austism; she has a larger vocabulary than I.       She often complains that people think that she is stupid too, and she believes that she is.       If she brings hoem anything below an "A +" she will complain that she failed the paper.       She is constantly calling herself and idiot, and wants to end everything at times. Like mentioned before, I have gotten her help, but nothing seems to help.       She finishes her hoemwork in five minutes, yet doesn't make below an "A".   She rarely turns in any of her work on time, and I'm wondering if this is because things are too easy?       She is in the program for the gifted at her school, but can't get into the HAG program, because she gets nervous during the tests, and flukes them. I know she knows that she can do better than that. And, I know taht too. I'm not pushing her at the least, I just want her to be happy agian.       She never seems to be able find books on her level, yet they aredesigned for her age? What's up here? Is she not tellign me something?    I think I may have cayght her sneaking adult books once or twice.       So, help a confused mother?

Last year my school started this Singapore math program and I want to know how many other schools do this. Basically there is no upper or lower level, everyone takes the same course at the same rate. This is a problem cause my school has complete retards and kids who are basically human calculators.

After three wasted months they split us into algebra and pre-algebra classes (we only had a higher and lower pre-algebra before this)    Basically I want to know if any school has no class difference and if anyone else had an algebra class in 7th grade.

Im writing a paper on how different color m&ms taste different then others? something like that. and half way through my essay when i was almost done i caught myself writing on how they dont taste different people know they dont..    here is what i have so far       Opening a bag of M&M’s, deposit them into a bowl and munching on a random handful is what some people may do. Frequently, before eating them one might pick out only a certain color of M&M’s because they think the colors may taste differently then others. But is there a reason why M&M’s are different colors? Some people think it matters, but the brain may play tricks. In most cases one color of an M&M can be more appealing; Even then many people like to think about what they are eating. Some people like to sort the M&M’s by color groups, piles, or rows. Afterwards snacking on them, beginning from ugliest to prettiest color, so that nearing the end, an especially attractive assortment is left behind. Maybe even some mortals eat only a particular color because it taste better then the others, such as blue, or red might remind them of cherry’s, strawberries and so on.

20090128143421AAeiUBd	Education & Reference;Homework Help	Opinion on my Barack Obama letter for language arts...?	Dear President Barack Obama:   (intro)I believe that you can accomplish many great things during your presidency to help the current problems that Americans are facing. Being president is a big responsibility, bigger than many of us can imagine, but I support you as do many others. I hope that you will do all that you promise.(1st par) As you know pollution is becoming an increasing problem. One large cause of pollution is from vehicles. I think you should focus on doing research on finding alternative energies that we could fuel vehicles with. If the research were successful we could cut down on pollution by reducing the use of gasoline or eliminating it altogether.(2nd par) People are losing jobs. People are having trouble providing for themselves and/or their families. The unemployment rate is rising, and something needs to be done so that enough jobs are available for everyone.(3rd par) The cost of living is becoming unreasonable. Prices of many things are rising like on food, gas, housing, etc. Something needs to be done so that the prices of everyday things lower so that they are more affordable.(conc.) During your presidency you will face many difficulties involving the economy. I hope you will consider addressing the issues I feel are important that are effecting some Americans due to the struggling economy. The best of wishes to you President Barack Obama, thank you.Sincerely, Amber V.

I do not know what equity means,nor what mutual or government bonds are and stuff like that.      the problem for vetinary services is that i did only okay in science classes at high school (only B's) Im in my junior year right now of high school and i am not taking any relevant science courses, such as AP Bio and AP Chem. I did take biology, but that was a year ago.      i want to get into a really good college. If i decide to go for vetinary services, then the colleges might be reluctant to accept me because they see i did only average in science courses and did not have any junior courses that would benefit me in becoming a vet.      but if i get into a business school, im afraid that i would struggle because i dont know the fundemental ideas.      im 16, and in junior year of high school.   help please.

But there are still a few prerequisite classes I need to complete before I can apply to grad school. I live in a very small town and the only option would be to take these courses at our local community college. Would this be a bad idea or hurt my chances in any way? Does it look bad to grad schools if you take courses at a community college? I have also thought about taking online courses. But I have tried that in the past and found that I do much better if I attend actual classes in the classroom rather than take them online.       Any info/advice would be greatly appreciated.
