The middle will be soupy when the outside is where you would normally take it out. Just the other night I made a pound cake and it was the same way! Should note that I always end up cooking the bread (and the pound cake) about 15-20 mins longer than recipe states. What is causing this and is there a solution? Lower temperature, longer cooking time, Higher temp, shorter cooking? Any advice would be welcome!

Pallier l’assoupissement du corps    L’attente de l’autre, non pour faire l’amour mais pour construire une relation où le sexe aurait une place naturelle : l’anorexie sexuelle renvoie souvent au vide sentimental. ? Le manque de désir sexuel témoigne souvent du manque de lien amoureux, assure J.-D. Nasio. La sexualité, c’est le plaisir que nous donne notre corps ou le contact avec le corps de l’autre. Qu’il soit solitaire, hétérosexuel ou homosexuel, il est nécessaire à tout le monde. Mais il est vrai que nous pouvons en avoir plus ou moins besoin et y prendre plus ou moins de plaisir. Faire l’amour n’est pas vital comme manger ou respirer. La sexualité nous aide à vivre : elle est un besoin psychologique mais pas physiologique. Il faut juste faire attention à conserver un moi intégral, où le corps garde sa place. ?

No matter what steak I have purchased in the past, they don't seem very tender when I grill them.  I am looking for a melt-in-your-mouth steak.  What is the best cut and what else should I look for in a good steak.  I had a friend that worked for Sysco and the steak we cooked was awesome and tender.  I forgot the cut and was wondering if I can get that quality at a local grocer.
