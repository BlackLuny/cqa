DGFu03Q3aa	Dear Terra:  You have some work to do!  The basis for mutual funds is calculated one of two ways (1) actual method (2) average basis. The actual method is adding all of your purchases and coming up with a final cost. The average method is calculated one of two ways, single category or double category. See IRS Pub 564 for further details. Also you will need to subtract any "nondividend distributions" received over the time you have owned the fund to calculate your basis.<br>  <br>  This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided.

Your ideas are gold so guard them carefully. Search on google or where-ever for a patent attorney in your area and set up an appointment to have him/her file the patent with you. It's costly but well worth it if you're serious about your idea and its potential.<br>  <br>  It could cost anywhere from 200 to idk dollars ($900 maybe) because you'd have to pay the patent attorney and the patent application fee.<br>  <br>  I wish you great success with your idea and business! <br>  <br>  One Love<3|`|f6y3pM4oaa	First of all, you have to tell your business concept to potential people in order to attract them to invest in your idea; therefore, you must give them key ideas in how your idea will succeed.

That might help, but the sad thing is, you were still scammed. The jewelery is low grade quality at best. That's why they sell it as what they want you to believe is incredibly low prices. BUYER BEWARE. For me the gold tarnished, the 'gem' stones fell out. I just ended up throwing them in the garbage and chalked it up as a lesson learned.<br>  <br>  Still, nothing ventured, nothing gained. Contact the web site you purchased from and ask them about their guarantee. It's possible they can provide new authentic appraisal certificates. Let them know you had a burglary. You will require the police report for insurance claims. However, it could work in your favour where the sympathy card is played.  If that doesn't work, contact your insurance company and ask about your coverages for jewelery. They might have a maximum they'd pay out to you but you have  to pay your deductible (you might be covererd for a maximum of $5000 AND AND AND, determine your detuctible. If you pay for the ring, they will subtract the deductible from the claim an remimburse you for the remainder). In this case, you will receive a check for $5000 (for example) minus your deductible. My insurance company never asked for proof of purchase. However, they will question regular claims and may ask you to provide detailed information. It really depends on the insurance company. Be careful of how many claims you make in the next year or too! Red flags will be raised if you start taking advantage of the insurance system an they are entitled to drop you as a client. This will problably make you a high risk insurance. Trust me, you could be paying thousands a month if you are not using discretion and common sense. <br>  <br>  I use state farm and they have always treated me as a trustworthy and honest client. I lost my wedding ring but had no prove of purchase. I went back to the gold smith who made the ring for me and he provided me with an appraisal for a small fee. This should suffice.

Go for the BSN, it will do you well in the future... you just wait and see.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for nursing schools, ALL of the schools that you said that have nursing programs are good. As long as you get into a nursing school, then you are pretty much set to go. My advise is, go to the school that has the cheapest tuition and one that isn't competative. Also, try going to one that isn't really well known or some crappy school that is accerdited to get your BSN degree with less stress. All hospitals, regardless of whether you graduated from a nursing program from an elite Ivy league or a low community college, will pretty much pay you the same amount and give the same work as associate degree nurses RN.  They don't care where the hell you graduated from, as long as you hold at least an ASN, but that is soon going to change to at least BSNs for some hospitals.

I personally don't think it's worth spending so much on a degree at a major university. I think a Associates from a community college is a good choice to start and will save your a tremedous about of money. Then you can start working and get your job to pay for your BSN if that's how far you want to go. There's a big debate on the ADN or BSN but really you won't make any more money, maybe a $1 more for the first few years, then with a BSN you can move up to management but you'd have to put in some time. You won't have trouble finding a job with just an ADN because nurses are always in such high demand.

4RjM5lElaa	Wow, what a great issue to have in this economy!<br>  <br>  If the job you now have is recession proof and the commute is less than the other and you can travel whenever to wherever...well, it seems like the prospects with the job you have are greater than the potential job.  If it's a new position you can make something great of it and the money will follow.  If you do this and prove a company vehicle is needed, maybe you can score one - and file it under travel needs.<br>  <br>  It just seems to me that jobs with a god working environment are hard to come by and if you scored one and it looks like something you can hang on to and excel in you should keep it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

wLIK0Gpoaa	Some qualifications are:<br>  <br>  1. Have a conforming loan backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Approximately 60% of single-family “conforming” loans are backed by these Government controlled mortgage giants. These are the companies that buy the loans from your bank/servicer and then sell them to Wall Street. A conforming loan is one under $417,000 in many areas — or up to $729,500 in certain high-cost areas like San Francisco, Boston or Washington, DC. Most home owners will have no idea if their loan is “backed” by Fannie or Freddie, but your lender or servicer does. So call them and then ask about qualifying under Obama’s housing plan. <br>  <br>  <br>  2. Your Loan to Value ratio can now be as high as 105%. Under current conditions you cannot refinance mortgages where the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio exceeds 80 percent without some form of credit insurance. That insurance can be difficult or impossible to obtain in parts of the country that insurers have labeled declining markets, with high risks of further deterioration in values. Under the Obama housing plan, the LTV has been raised to 105%, which means you qualify even if you owe between 80-105% of your mortgage. However it you are severely “underwater” and owe more than 105% of their home’s value you will not qualify and may have to wait for mortgage relief via other lender driven provisions in the housing plan.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  3. Allows borrowers with less than 20% equity in their homes to refinance to the current prevailing rate. However they must meet the above LTV criteria.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  4. Timeframe Eligibilty. Only Loans that originated on or before January 1, 2009 are eligible for this program. The modification program will be in effect until the end of 2012, but loans can only be adjusted once.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  5. Bonus Payments. Borrowers who keep up with their new payments will receive up to $1,000 a year in principal reduction, for up to five years.<br>  <br>  <br>  6. Modification Threshold. Servicers will follow a specified sequence of steps in order to reduce the monthly payment (with government subsidies) to no more than 31% of gross monthly income (DTI).

VeBSkkYNaa	You should contact your creditors and try to work out something.  It would be much better than attempting to declare bankruptcy, especially for such a small amount of debt.  Get everything in writing when you make arrangements.  Most creditors are happy to work something out, especially if you contact them before you are too far behind.  They will frequently work out smaller payments, waive fees, even lower interest rates, but you need to make the call.  Don't wait until they are breathing down your neck.

Best is to call your creditors, tell them your problems and you might find a very caring person to help you out. <br>  <br>  Also there are free financial agencies that will help you arrange a budget. Check out your local Better Business Bureau or contact your state Representative.<br>  <br>  Good luck and Hope this Helps|`|MbzyriZ4aa	The whole idea about bankruptcy is that you are so unsolvent that there is no way that you can pay for your debts.<br>  <br>  That doesn't seem to apply to your situation.

RhEhzGbraa	Depending on what state you are in and their specific requirements, you will probably at least need your P & C license as an agent & a separate P & C license as a broker if you want to write excess or surplus markets (this license also usually requires a bond).  You will also need a Certificate of Occupancy for your office space and in some states they also require that you obtain a Basic Business License and that you obtain a state tax registration number for use in filing Property Taxes, Annual Reports, etc.  You will also need to obtain a Federal Identification Number to be able to open a bank account (and depending on the state requirements you might have to open two bank accounts--one for Premium/Escrow funds where you keep clients monies and the second one for your operating funds), report unemployment tax, pay Federal withholding taxes, etc. <br>  <br>  The most important requirement will be for you to obtain the appointments or contracts from the insurance companies so that you are able to market and sell their products.  Without a good company to give you a contract, it will be very difficult if not impossible to be successful.  Having the contacts as you state is great but you what you really need are the contracts!  In order to obtain the contracts, I suggest that you start on a Business Plan including a Marketing Plan, Mission Statement, SWOT analysis, etc.  Once you have this done you can approach your contacts and go through the steps necessary to convince them that you want an appointment and will be able to successfully and profitably market and sell their policies.<br>  <br>  Also FYI starting a "scratch" agency is not easy.  Be prepared for 60 to 70 hour work weeks, cold calling, etc.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.  Good Luck!|`|f6ot8kHSaa	If you want to be a broker to sell insurance for different carriers, you need to get licensed and contact the carriers you want to get appointed with. Some carriers only use career agents. If you are selling P&C some carriers won't even contract you until you have a proven track record and some states require a license for a surplus lines broker on top of your insurance license.<br>  <br>  A brokerage is where you would be giving brokers contracts and getting an override commission on the business they write. In order to do this you need to become a good producer then you can recruit brokers to write business that you will get an override on.<br>  <br>  I have a good contact for life and annuity business I can refer you to just contact me if you are interested.|`|AA11458672	Depend which state you run your office.

3Ze4nR9Caa	You as the buyer, or in this case, the renter, do NOT pay for the brokers fees.  Agents are compensated by the sellers and landlords.  It won't cost you anything extra to use an agent.  Depending on how much you are looking to pay in rent though, some agents may not find it worth their time to work for you.<br>  <br>  Other than that, you can try Craigslist (it's awesome for finding rentals).  Or, look on the internet for some property management companies in your area (they almost always list their available rentals on their websites).  Another option, is to visit a local real estate office and see if they have a list of available rental properties.  In the city I live in, we have a local publication that private owners, agents and property managers advertise in and it's distributed once a week so there's always new listings.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|QAlnz6syaa	TRY CRAIGSLIST.COM

kSZx9cY5aa	I would definitely start looking in advance-maybe 12 weeks, and definitely do not tell them you are only looking for a temporary position. If I were an employer I would hire someone who's planning to leave in a few months. So just don't mention that, if they happen to ask tell them you are planning on sticking around lol!<br>  <br>  You're a mommy, so for you I would suggest applying at a whole bunch of babies/children's stores. It's a good environment to work in, and they're not usually too picky about who they hire. As long as you're neat, and appropriate. The fact that you're a mom helps, and retail experience would be a plus.<br>  Restaurants, cafes, fast food, grocery stores and retail are always good places to start looking.<br>  <br>  You could also do nannying or child care. Advertise in your local newspapers, because a lot of people are looking for childcare options because day cares are so packed and expensive. You could look after them in your house, so you could have your own kids with you. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|HWMXTF1Haa	Well I'd do anything, even if it meant getting a part time job at McDonald's.

IVCS3DbRaa	Getting rid of existing riff raff is a challenge, since  they are the only customers.. You could end up just closing it. Whats better is to identify issues rather than blaming it on the customers.   I can think of exactly the same situation at a bar nearby, so I will talk to you about them.<br>  <br>  They spent $30k on a simple remodel, bought fancy furniture, as well as paint, art, etc. But they still do not clean the bathrooms adequately and there is mold growing on the grout. The furntiure has become so important that you cant have any fun there. They have barred people for dancing in their seats, stealing a $3 glass ashtray, and yellat people for not using a coaster under their beer. Its NOT a fun place to be. In their attempts to get rid oif the rifraf, they barred a few people who were the "Norms" of teh place, the people everyone else liked to talk to. So one customer leaving takes 10 with them. They are doing better with crowds now, but have to spend money on entertainment nightly just to get the same business level they had before.<br>  <br>  I could probably spend an hour there and tell you exactly what needs to be done, but a bar is a delicate balance. Rather than try to pull in business, they need to create a place where everyone feels comfortable and welcome. Anything thats FUN is always a good plan, and maybe that starts with new employees. Promotions are good too, whether they last all day or ten minutes. One bar nearby does any drink for a buck at exactly 5pm. Another has bar bingo on Thursday nights.  A local "oldies station" draws hundreds of people with their "happy hour" remotes. But in spite of all the promos, you build a bar business one customer at a time. <br>  <br>  I could write pages, but no time and most of it will be wasted.|`|Saul1Bhuaa	Close the existing bar.  Remodel and relaunch with various promotions that would attract a different crowd.|`|q0GK3a8jaa	Start a Free Texas Hold-em Poker League.  You must pay out to create attraction.  Depending on the business income most successful bars/sports bars pay anywhere from $50-$100 to the winner of the tournament.  I live in Texas so this practice is legal, however there are a few rules you should research.  Many bar rooms are using this strategy to create a competitive edge.  There is a lot to learn in running a poker tournament and League.  Poker players like strict, clean games.  MUST have rules that are fair and MUST be followed.  Nobody likes a poker tournament with little to no table etiquette.  You might have to keep the RIFF RAFF in line.  I've seen many tournaments dwindle down over time due poor management.  Run a good clean game and this should get business flowing again.  I love to play a nice clean game of poker and have a few beers and some nights many beers.   <br>  <br>  Let's do the math. <br>  30 players X average $10 each on beverages and food(maybe more, i know guys that spend $80 a night)=$300 <br>  You pay $100 for 1st place or <br>  You pay $50 for 1st and $25 for 2nd and $10 bar tab certificate for 3rd<br>  It is profitable and fun at the same time.  Hope this helps.

Ckeh0zfoaa	Credit.com is a well known company.  Companies like Credit.com and Bankrate.com shop your social security number to top lenders in an effort to get you "offers" for credit.<br>  <br>  It is safe to give Credit.com your SSN# but don't give your information to too many websites because it can hurt your credit if multiple entities run your credit.  The benefit of using Credit.com is that your credit report is only ran once and then distributed securely.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your credit search.  There are many programs for people with bad credit and Credit.com is a good place to start.
d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	Sole Proprietorships generally use the following sources of financing:<br>  <br>  Personal Savings<br>  Home Equity Loans<br>  Personal Credit Cards<br>  Loans or investments from family and friends<br>  <br>  Generally other methods like Lines of Credit from banks won't be available until the business has existed for a few years and has grown.<br>  <br>  My reason?  I've had 3 family members start their own businesses.  All 3 have been started using these sources of financing.
16vMIGPiaa	I live in Huntsville...<br>  <br>  We don't have anyone listed in the phone book under "Debt Consolidation", but then I'm sure you already looked.<br>  If you do a Yellowpages.com search for debt consolidation, you'll find about a dozen listings.<br>  <br>  You probably don't need an attorney yet.<br>  <br>  Please oh please do not even suggest bankruptcy at this point.  Bankruptcy is forever.  Even though it doesn't appear on your credit history after seven years, if you ever apply for a loan in the future it will ask "Have you ever filed for bankruptcy?" and you must answer "Yes" no matter how long ago it was.<br>  <br>  At $22K on a car loan, it's likely you're still upside down - owe more than the car is worth.  You'll have to stick that loan out until you're at least even.<br>  Are any of these loans student loans?  If so, you can stretch your payments out to as much as 10 years.<br>  <br>  And liajewelry has offered a very good suggestion: consider a Dave Ramsey class.  The next classes around here are:<br>  St. Mark's Lutheran - previews 3/17 & 3/24, class starts 4/7<br>  Hope Community Church - class starts 3/16<br>  Cove UM Church (Hampton Cove) - class starts 3/1|`|DRxAz6V2aa	Ok - sell the car.  Why do you a need a $22,000 car??<br>  Debt consolidation will only help if you stop using credit - otherwise you will find yourself with the credit cards charged up again.  Work hard to stay on time with your bills - and find a non-profit group to help you.  Anything is better that bankruptcy.  However the best solution is to get on a budget and commit to no new debt.

L475HEEBaa	Its a bit random. And as an online retailer, you need to be concerned about how services such as google display your website. You may pay for advertising, but if you want to get anywhere in google for free you MUST have a domain that is related. Not only on google, but in any case where people can search for your business, such as yell.com etc. Even in advertisments such as Adwords, you must display a 'display' url, an url such as 'i-gobi' would make anyone think twice, try having a more related business name so people actually know what your business is about.|`|e4e7e0324d2866e6e4d170924dfd4407aa	Sounds like an online company selling sand|`|ZEwAalKPaa	Very strange!

OacSIfSiaa	This will not change your debt utilization ratio by simply transferring a balance.  Whether it is one card or more, the total utilization ratio is what affects your score.<br>  <br>  Also make sure you can pay off the full amount in time on that 0% APR as many have hidden clauses that state the 0% APR changes after a period of time or in some cases if the amount of credit used exceed a certain percentage.  READ the fine print before making a decision.<br>  <br>  If transferring that $800 puts you at your credit limit on the 0% card make sure you put it away and be prepared to have to pay off the whole amount within a specified time frame.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps answer your question.|`|qBCGH52haa	As long as you don't close the card being paid off, your credit score will not be hurt - the available debt ratio os based on the total available debt, not the available debt on each single account, so, if you transfer the $800, assuming you don't just run up the balance on that card again, your overall balance doesn't change ($1100 plus $800 is still $1900 no matter where it is) and your credit limits don't change.<br>  <br>  What you need to watch out for is the transfer fee and the expiration date of the 0% - usually there is a 2 to 3 percent transfer fee (about $16 to $24 in this case).  If your zero percent expires soon, you may not have enough time to recoup the transfer fee.  If you have say 6 months or more left over, you will definitely recoup that fee through interest not charged.|`|tmh42R6Caa	This is a case of what's worse - paying a high interest rate or carrying a high balance?  I would say that having a 0% rate and a high balance is better than paying high interest rates.  That is only going to make it harder to pay it down.  I would definiately transfer.|`|qGfAlDd2aa	Check the rate on balance transfers first!  The other card may have a 0% introductory rate but charge for balance transfers.  If the rate is still lower than the 17% you should transfer.<br>  <br>  17% is a pretty high rate, this is eating your lunch.  Whatever you do, you need to be aggressive on paying it off.  Carrying a balance is not a good thing.
sI3krJULaa	First of all, you need to remember two things that could get you into trouble if you're not careful.  1) It is only 58.5 cents per mile on mileage after 7/1/8.  Before that, it's 50.5 cents per mile. 2) A cell phone is a risky claim unless he has a cell phone expressly for his business or keeps very meticulous records.  Two of our clients have been audited over a cell phone claim.  Luckily, they had separate cell phones for business and personal.<br>  <br>  As for the mileage, you don't receive it "back".  It's an expense deduction, but it's not refundable in any way.  So if it reduces his income to zero (or helps to do so), then he'll get back any estimates he made throughout the year, but nothing more.  And he'll still have to pay his self-employment taxes- those aren't refundable.<br>  <br>  It's a good thing that you have a tax person.  What they mean is that he probably paid in 1600 more than he ended up owing for income taxes.  Part of that refund is probably due to the mileage deduction.  But, again- you can't get back more than you paid in.  <br>  <br>  This is oversimplified, but say he made 2000 total in estimated payments.  When you add up all of his income, then subtract all of his legitimate expenses, if there's nothing (or a negative number), then he'd get all of his 2000 back.  On the other hand, say he had a small net income- say 25,000.  Then he'd only get back part of what he'd paid in (the 2000) because there is now income he owes tax on.<br>  <br>  I hope that makes sense.  Good luck! :0)

But before they could get him, they would have to prove what he is doing.|`|aTkPzOPSaa	Be sure to get receipts or pay with a money order (keep the copy)!  This guy could easily say you haven't been paying full, and use it as a tactic to get rid of you, while getting full rent!<br>  <br>  Now, if he's gonna kick you out anyway, I'd leave and report him to the IRS.  There's likely a trail where he's done this before.<br>  <br>  For example, they would spot drops in the price of rent or unusually low rent.|`|f312d6ca9de81d657649ed106303de78aa	This is illegal and it would probabley get him into alot of trouble with the IRS if he doesnt file the cash part.

Get him to give you something in writing and signed.Ask if you can read over it and think about it before making your decision.

Now if you pay him cash, he needs to write out complete receipts, his name address, address of the unit, his signature etc etc etc, so you can show a judge something was up. Why not just give notice and move, if he wants you out, he wants you out. Hes trying to do something to get you out, so just go, legally he can ask for his property back at any time if its month to month, if its a contract, he still can give 2 months notice in most states and get you out too. <br>  Id say, is this bldg in forclosure, oh my god, your losing the bdlg, when will we have to move out,and freak out haha and fake this person out, this might get them to leave it alone about the cash part. Throw it thier direction instead of you having to cope with paying half cash, make them prove thier not in foreclosure and your safe there at the apts. Business is like a game, dont get burnt.|`|P9oP8CS9aa	If you only have half the rent on a reciept, then he will kick you out for non payment. Do you have a lease, if he/she isn't treating you right "tell your uncle sam, you know the boys at the IRS about his idea" They don't sound sound too honest and is probably not paying on his income tax, and doing that way would definitally get you evicted.|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	Tell him to lower your rent and you'll think about it. He can't kick you out without a valid reason. But he can increase the rent....No, what's he's talking about is illegal. And the IRS will bust him anyway. If he only claims $500 income on a $1,000 a month apartment,that's going to raise a red flag to someone. I'd probably start looking for another place just to protect yourself.

Indeed, I would highly suggest you to become a doctor, nurse or dentist which are one of the jobs with highest demand meaning is going to be easy for you to get a job with a good salary. However, as I said before, this will only work for you if you like it otherwise you will really hate your ljob if you happen to choose something you dont really like. Please put more details and probably we can suggest more

I would look into colleges that have support systems for people with mental illness. In WI. Marquette, University of Madison, University of Wisconsin- Eau Claire have such programs.

I would have her take a abilities and interest test and an aptitude test to see where her interests are combine with her aptitudes.  I am not for sure nursing is a good choice because it is high stress, but being a medical technologist would be a good job.  In fact she should check into different jobs into the medical field because that will be a growing field for years.  It would be good for her self-esteem to have a profession.

4RjM5lElaa	Well, you need to lay out a plan.

AA10305589	This is my suggestion - take on the additional responsibilities.  If you don't you definitely won't get any additional money in a few months.  If, after a few months, you do not get a promotion, you can always start looking for a new job at that time - and you will have more skills to put on your resume, making you more likely to get a better job.  If you say yes, it's a win-win situation.  If you say no, you are turning down the opportunity to improve your current position, and improve your future opportunities.|`|Saul1Bhuaa	I think your manager is being very honest with you.

AA10305589	First, if you want to hold a silent auction, i suggest that you attend an event or events that are hosting such auctions, so you can get first hand experience about what is going on.  <br>  <br>  There are companies that do 'consignment auctions' which mean that they provide the item and run the auction for you, and you pay a set price for the items and get to keep any money raised at the auction above that price.  For example, if you 'consign' an auction item, and their price is $100, you can start bidding at $150 - any bids over $100 are profit to you, and since you reserved the item on consignment, you don't have to pay anything if it does not sell.  <br>  <br>  Here's the list of such companies that showed up in a Yahoo search of "consignment + silent + auction"<br>  <br>  <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search;_ylt=A0geu.81.7FJCJoA4gpXNyoA?p=consignment+silent+auction&fr=">http://search.yahoo.com/search;_ylt=A0ge...</a>|`|fkMevLeqaa	I've worked with hundreds of charity auctions, this guide was the best free one I found. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thebiddery.com/Silent%20Auction%20Guide.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.thebiddery.com/Silent%20Aucti...</a><br>  <br>  If you need items for your silent auction, consider a service like The Biddery.

They will interview you over the phone and tell you if you will get that extension and how much you will get.

OacSIfSiaa	To set the record straight, lease or rental payments DO NOT appear on credit reports!  Your friend would only be affected it the main person who the lease is under defaults and skips out owing rent or shows a consistent record of being late.  Even then it would have to be a rental agencies that is registered with a credit reporting agency and pays a fee.  <br>  <br>  It the renter skips out and owes a large amount, then it would go to collections and perhaps even small claims court, if this happens then your friends credit would be in big trouble and they could come after them for the debt.<br>  <br>  Tell, them NOT to co-sign, it will save a friendship later on if things go wrong.<br>  <br>  Hope this answers your question.|`|HeFlBmGSaa	If you are talking about leasing out a house/condo/apartment then no that will not be reported on their credit report and will have no effect on their credit score unless you were to not pay the lease and it went to collections.<br>  <br>  If you are talking about leasing a car, then yes that will get reported on their credit report but if you made 12 payments on your own, then they likely could get that waived from the debt to income calculations when they applied for a mortgage or for other credit.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps.|`|DibzbnVhaa	They are absolutely correct. It will show up on their credit report and prevent them from being granted any additional credit because of the income / debt ratio.
bFRVSDteaa	In past years, NY state has often delayed paying tax refunds when cash was tight. This is nothing new. NY state will never admit it, but the consensus is that this is related to the end of the state's fiscal year. The NY state income tax refund flow tends to drop to a trickle in February and March, and then go back to normal after the new fiscal year starts on April 1. The larger your refund, the more likely they will delay payment.<br>  <br>  I hope it's different this year. I'm waiting for mine, too. Good luck!<br>  <br>  BTW, the best solution is to reduce your withholding or estimated tax payments next year so that you owe NY state a small amount in April, rather than making them an interest-free loan throughout the year.|`|AA11284831	NYS is a notoriously slow pay on tax refunds.

kgNgqNUlaa	This is true. Taken from www.socialsecurity.gov, it states: President Obama recently signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.  This act provides for the one-time payment of $250 to individuals who get Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Social Security benefits. We expect everyone who is entitled to a payment to receive it by late May 2009. No action is required on your part.   <br>  <br>  We are currently working on the details regarding how we will issue nearly 55 million one-time payments to our beneficiaries. When more information becomes available, we will promptly post it here.  Please bookmark this site and check back regularly.  Thank you.<br>  <br>  Also, it's a good idea to IGNORE any emails from ANYONE with regards to getting money, etc.; it's not the way reputable companies do business.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	If you are receiving SS benefits, you shouldn't have to do anything.|`|XHhJ8ffRaa	The one-time payment of $250 will be directly from the SSA instead.

qBCGH52haa	Figure a little closer to 45 to 60 days with some of that time frame by request (most folks like to close toward the end of a month to save on the prepaids).  Setting the closing much beyond 60 days might scare off buyers (who wants to wait for a seller when you are plunking down hundreds of thousands of dollars).  <br>  <br>  On the other hand, also figure that in this market, the odds are you will take a good 30 days to sell your house.  Some markets are taking on average 3 months or more for a house to sell.  Obviously, this will vary by market, surrounding area, price, etc.|`|AA11173563	it takes no longer to close on a $600,000 loan than a $60,000 loan they are the same except the lender may require 2 appraisals.|`|4cfX7AThaa	I'm not a real estate agent, but logic suggests that as long as all the paperwork is in order and funding is there, it shouldn't take any longer than normal.|`|laVGEEeraa	Averages depend on the market at the time, so it is hard to come up with these numbers in today's market.  Yes, you can come up with a decent base with previous experience, but most times the time frame is agreed upon by both parties.  The amount of the selling/buying price of the house is not a determinate.  If your purchase is dependent on the sale of your current house (which is often the case), you may want to get your house on the market soon, and write that whomever buys your place cannot move in until June.  <br>  <br>  When I bought my current house, I had a bridge loan, so my purchase was not dependent on selling my previous residence (financed by a relative, so I don't have any further information on that type of loan).  We settled in 60 days, which was written into the sale by the sellers.

Request written confirmation that the account is closed and 0 balance.<br>  <br>  In the future, read thru all the fine print before you apply for a credit card.

Do you know what credits you're eligable for and why you're not eligable for the ones you're not?  <br>  <br>  Oh, and TurboTax is only free if you're just doing a federal return.  If you have a state return that you want to efile it will cost $45.|`|F08HDRvraa	I have filed with turbo tax the last two years free of charge.  The instructions are easy to understand and follow.

laVGEEeraa	I used to live in a 2 bedroom condo that was part of an association of three condo buildings and 6 quad-homes.  We had a community pool that everyone had access to.<br>  <br>  It was listed in our bylaws that those in the quad-homes paid 60% of the maintenance costs for the pool and the condos paid 40%.  There were 1 bedroom and 3 bedroom condos as well as other 2 bedroom ones.  We all paid different HOA fees based on our square footage, the age of the buildings (some were a few years older than others) and the pool usage fee, as well as other fees such as garbage and snow removal.<br>  <br>  The meeting regarding increasing the fees may have been held a year ago, prior to your purchasing.  Since counties prepare property taxes for the current year to be paid next year, this is most likely the case (and could be why the previous homeowners sold).  The 2/3 vote is usually a quorum, which means 2/3 of those that go to the homeowners meeting, not 2/3 of all residents. If only 6 people showed up to the meeting and 4 voted for the increase, that's a 2/3 vote.<br>  <br>  Its also possible that the HOA had not increased the previous owner's fees due to some other circumstance and was just waiting for them to move to up them to where they should be.  The fees on the unit of your neighbor who pays 450 may increase to 600 or more should s/he move.<br>  <br>  Most HOA are made up of a few residents volunteering in addition to an outside company.  Find out who they are and talk to them.|`|AA11173563	yes you have rights. ask for a HOA meeting and ask the secretary to show you the minutes from the last meeting as I would fight this tooth and nail|`|AA11132354	Usually based on square footage.  Read the bylaws.  Otherwise they can't treat people differently.  Read up on condo laws in your state.  Check that they are complying with Open Meetings, annual meetings, notices.  Make a written request for explanation of fees, notices and meetings approving it, send it to ALL board members (or just President).  Be polite and civil.|`|NcFWcO3Laa	Ask the HOA for the minutes of the meeting where the vote was taken and the changes were made.  Most by-laws require an advance notice before making changes in fees.  Was that notice given to all the owner prior to the vote?  From what you are saying it sounds like HOA  board is trying to pull a fast one.|`|AWSmknxLaa	many HOA charge by square foot, so a bigger unit pays more.<br>  <br>  Ask for an explanation on the increase.  I would bet there was a vote a long time ago and just went into effect.  By laws can be changed.|`|4MypYVHYaa	Prior to buying you should have been given a copy of the CC&Rs as well as the by-laws with amendments of the Home Owner's Association (HOA) These documents outline the duties, fees and other items that the HOA can do and who is authorize to do them as well as the rules on how to raise the fees and by how much.<br>  <br>  If you were not given a copy of these documents prior to your closing, you should immediately get a copy and read them carefully.<br>    <br>  Once you read them you are members of the association,by you purchasing there. As members of the association you may challenge any thing that you don't understand and have a right for them to be explained to you.<br>  <br>  I hope this has been of some use to you, good luck.<br>  <br>  "FIGHT ON"|`|AA10979361	HOA 's will try to get away with anything they can to put more money into their pockets! We have been told we are totally hosed with our 'forever-debt' as it has been called. The landscaping Co. has their hands DEEP into the pockets of our association, & there isn't anything anybody can do about it.  Liars & Cheaters they are!! (That's why we're moving) <br>  <br>  Anyway, about your situation, try to find out if there is anybody, or any company in the pockets of your association. Then, you CAN & should take your by-laws & go see a lawyer.  Tell him about the whole situation & see if there is cause for a lawsuit. You need an unbiased mediator.  <br>  Every home owner should pay the same fee!  It really sounds like they have broken the by-laws, & if they have, ask the lawyer how you can call for a dissolution of the association.|`|kmTlCtOPaa	Many HOA dues are prorated based on load factor of your unit.  Is you unit larger than theirs?
l1VZkkOSaa	It just means that they need to enter the unit to ensure that everything is safe: wiring, plumbing, smoke alarms working properly, cleanliness of the unit, etc.

There is a ton of useful information on how to become wealthy. It can be done, quickly even. You just have to have  the right formula.|`|5BTKscZraa	By writing and selling books on how to get rich....or...by writing "self help" books with the same generic advise that's been around for 50 years ("change how you feel about the situation"). Either of these methods will make you rich...|`|tNAZ9Qr7aa	Just based on that question I am confident you will never be rich and "live like a rockstar"|`|LOrFtSCHaa	You have to work hard, live on less than you make, give and save save save, do not spend on unnecessary things.  This is a slow process, but it is the way to do it. Unless you belong to the NFL or MBA .....
FC5BxnoPaa	It is only 400 if that is where it ends, but don't forget about delivery costs. Read the description, it should say if you can pick it up. You either need to pick it up or have someone deliver it, and that will be expensive.|`|FrzCscBlaa	sign up for an account and you probably should set up a paypal account as well.  and as for bidding if the bid price is at 400, then price should be the price up by bid increments usually for dvds and games its .25 cents so as long as your above the price at the current moment.|`|tNAZ9Qr7aa	If it ends at 400, then the person who bid that 400 gets the car (and is obligated to pay for it)
1NGnqnsJaa	yes you can! On the IRS authorized E-File website there are links to interactive Tax Return Calculators for the current and last year's Form 1040 tax returns. These Calculators are most ideal for individuals who file standard non-itemized tax returns. They also have the option for calculating itemized returns as well, but you must figure your deductions off-screen on a Form 1040 Schedules A&B, which is linked on page 2 line 40 of the calculators. <br>  <br>  Other Financial Preparation websites also have their own versions, such as H&R Block, and www.TaxBrain.com ... to find more, simply run "Tax Return Calculator" through your favorite search engine.|`|Pjm9pg7iaa	Not really. The IRS does not know how much you owe until you submit your completed tax return. Of course, once you complete the return you know exactly how much you owe.<br>  It is possible for you to complete the return and leave the last line empty; you are asking the IRS to calculate your refund..
Ls93X4ufaa	No you do not. The only fees you will pay will be to ebay and those are your seller fees.|`|LOrFtSCHaa	Yeah, it sucks, Im sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but the fees are really high, you pay paypal a percentage of what you receive from the sales, and ebay is higher.  So at the end of the month you will be hit with two bills, but not a monthly bill from paypal is based on transactions.  My suggestions to you use craigslist.org its free.|`|DQkDQraOaa	I've never paid a monthly fee to Paypal and I sell sporadically on ebay. The only fees I pay to Paypal are taken right out of each payment made to me. It's a very minor amount.|`|iZTGQzeraa	I am an ebay powerseller with over 5,000 feedback and it is a shame to say that you will get hit with large fees, however, paypal fees are instant (as soon as the winning bidder pays). A percentage of the money is automatically taken out of their payment, like it was never there in the first place :) Ebay fees are due monthly and include the listing fee (which includes the insertion fee - depending on the amount you start the item for - and any extras you add like bold titles, subtitle, featured pictures, etc) and final value fee (percentage of what the item sold for). Just make sure you calculate these fees along with shipping fees when you list the items. If you do not sell anything, you do not pay any fees, that is the good thing. But if you list an item and it does not sell, you will still be charged the ebay insertion fee - sometimes it is credited if you relist the item, but not always. Also, the more you sell, the less the fees are (just FYI)......Ebay is a wonderful place if you know what you are doing and do  your research. Hope this helps, good luck!

People may reject you for your age, but in my experience, people give you respect for giving it a go at a young age. <br>  <br>  I mentioned to someone else, although the main goal is the money, the best part of starting from a young age is that you gain a lot of experience.

1PglCzjMaa	all i can tell you is to keep on Thinking and dreaming.<br>  I'm 15 years, almost 16 years old and my parents also try to crash my ideas, but i don't let them. College is not the only way to success. I would say go into sales/marketing. just go to community college, take a marketing/advertising class along with a business class. only go for 1 or 2 years man, not too long. Then try to approach a small sales team working in the technological sector. Theres nothing wrong with selling software, as every computer needs that. After getting experience, Break off and start your own company.<br>  <br>  One thing my dad always told me, the one thing i actually listen to him about, for he started his own company, is "Get as much experience as you can, then Start working for yourself."<br>  <br>  A few years of experience won't hurt anyone man, because going out into the world with no knowledge is very risky, <br>  <br>  I plan on starting companies and selling them, and i hope everything works out for you buddy|`|niCPySUOaa	Study and learn. I know it sounds simple but that's really the key.<br>  <br>  Your parents really do want the best for you. Maybe your Mother says the things she says because she doesn't want to see your business fail like so many others - and she wants you to be successful in life. For the record: Her comments are NOT because she's Asian - it's a universal (trust me on that!).<br>  <br>  At 17 you still have a lot of learning to do, but one thing that I encourage you to do is to rethink the computer business. So many households have them but cannot afford the funds to keep them virus-free, up-to-date, etc., so having a side gig like that could lead to bigger things - esp if your rep grows among your peers.<br>  <br>  Keep up your positive attitude. You'll do well.

If you intend to sell them, you have to be licensed. There is also the matter of health and FDA regulations in the preparation and containment of such products.

No need to number them.|`|zuGKIWfNaa	BY "label them" do you mean what file names should you give them? I suggest "coverletter.doc", "references.doc", and "resume.doc". <br>  <br>  If you mean you're actually going to number the pages, please don't. What you are sending them are three separate and individual items, and each one should be able to stand alone. No numbers are required. (Nobody will get them "mixed up". They won't look at the cover letter and somehow think it's actually a list of references.)

(Unless publisher is the one who goes through another persons writing and edits it then when it is perfect publishes it?). And I'm not fond of writing news stories.

aqsUYT9naa	The bank does have to pay the real estate taxes (and all other expenses) while they hold foreclosed property.  When they sell the foreclosed property, they must have paid all delinquent taxes in order to offer clear title to the new owners.  There are usually taxes paid by the buyer (which are detailed on the closing statement), but these are the pro-rata taxes for the current period that will be placed in escrow for when the taxes are legally due to the county.  Rest assured, this part of the world is still "fair" and the bank does have to pay any taxes due up to the date of the resale.|`|4MtR8MLpaa	yes they pay the taxes, sort of. I just bought a house today and we were going through the closing costs line by line when it came to taxes they "gave" me money to bring the taxes current which showed as a credit to me and then I paid the taxes as the next line showed a debit to me. Why they did it that way I cannot tell you but that is what happened today

Ch9TedMcaa	The government is printing too much money as it is. You risk hyperinflation by printing more and more money.|`|u1T5TQP7aa	it must be backed up by either gold or silver, look up the silver standard in the time of the Depression you will the understand why this is not possible|`|4f3GfrN6aa	The money a government prints has to be backed up by gold or other assets.  If they print more money, then the value of the currency devalues because there is more currency to the same amount of gold in reserve.  This causes mass inflation and the currency becomes worthless.<br>  <br>  Thats why in places like Zimbabwe you get your days wages in a wheelbarrow and by the time you knock off work, it's not even enough to buy a loaf of bread.|`|3QsPl1uLaa	When a government prints too much money inflation or hyper-inflation results.

0uWqjL2raa	You can claim the cost of repairs that was not reimbursed by the insurance company.  You will fill out a form 4684 which carries to the schedule A(itemized deductions.)  <br>  <br>  Nonbusiness casualty or theft losses are deductible only to the extent that the amount of the loss from each separate casualty or theft is more than $100 and the total amount of all losses (as so reduced) during the year is more than 10% of adjusted gross income (Form 1040, line 38, or Form 1040NR, line 36). However, these limits do not apply to losses that arose in the Midwestern disaster areas (defined on page 1 under What's New) and that were caused by the severe storms, tornadoes, or flooding. The 10% limit does not apply to net disaster losses resulting from federally declared disasters

There are no exceptions to this.  I would suggest that you not even consider taking the money in cash...  You should take payment in the form of a cashiers check or money order if you are transferring to another financial institution or brokerage house (or any other person, business or organization).  If you elect a payment form other than cash, no CTR is required.  The bank will still require you to complete Federal withholding election forms (also required by law).

7HKTDcvYaa	If you reward only the individual you need to be evaluating the work and success of each of the individuals. But if the team as a whole fails miserably, you may not be able to see a way to reward anyone. Individual rewards promote attention to being perceived as contributing whereas rewarding the team rewards doing anything needed to make the team's efforts successful.<br>  <br>  If your interests are aligned with the success of the team effort, it is ethical to encourage behaviour most likely to accomplish this.<br>  <br>  As for instance as a teacher in a computer college I would set up a team effort that  encouraged the members to teach each other, and to measure results of that teaching.  The individual had to teach because that is such a large part of the job they will do, and they had to cooperate by learning for the same reason. They had to use evaluation as part of the teaching/learning process, and to get cooperation (learning).<br>  <br>  I independently measured the success of the team rather than the individuals. First time out there was always big differences between teams. With each new task they had learned a lot more about team work. But by rewarding only the team, everyone became oriented toward the success of the team's efforts.<br>  <br>  There was lots of individual reward too. one needs to balance reward of individual with reward of team. Out in the job there will be both need to cooperate and to compete.|`|1du7Nbfbaa	off the top of my head I'd say it depends on whether you want to reward individual effort or build team unity.<br>  <br>  In most thing one person cannot do it all themselves and they have to rely on the rest of the team to support them, so in the long run rewarding the team is probably more beneficial.
RZzMse3Haa	Nope, once you sign that agreement you are locked in.  Sometimes a landlord will allow the cosigner to be removed after the 1st year ONLY if the primary tenant has had good payment history.  If they have ever been late or have had to be served any notices, then you are not going to be allowed to be removed.  Good payment history or not, you cannot be removed with out the landlord agreeing to it.<br>  <br>  All you can do is call the landlord and ask.

2NhvZ6HRaa	Multiply 4% by $60,000  equals 2,400  in bad potential bad debt. <br>  <br>  You would add the (300.00) credit which is already in the allowance for noncollectable, to the $2,400 for a total of 2,700.00.<br>  <br>  Your entry would be,  Debit $2,700 to allowance for noncollectable and Credit A/R by $2.700.   Obviously you bad debt would be $2,400, your A/R will be reduced by the same amount.|`|AA11357056	The balance in the Allowance for Uncollectible accounts does have to be $2,400 - so you would need to credit the Allowance account for $2,100 - but the debit side of the adjusting entry goes to Bad Debt Expense, not Accounts Receivable.|`|Gun3UGzaaa	If you think that 4% of $60,000 in sales will be uncollectible, then you have to have enough in the Allowance for Uncollectible accounts to write off as bad debt for that amount.<br>  <br>  So the first thing is to figure out 4% of $60,000.  ($60,000 x 0.04 = $2,400).<br>  <br>  The second thing is to see whether or not the allowance is big enough to cover that $2,400.  Since the $300 is less than $2,400, you have a deficiency in the reserve of $2,100.<br>  <br>  You have to credit Allowance for bad debt $2,100 (making that balance $2,400).  You also have to debit an asset account  - accounts receivable by an equal amount $2,100.|`|gTuoOpOKaa	The question states 4% of SALES suggesting income statement approach. The entry will be Debit Bad debts expense and credit allowance for uncollectible account with $2,400. The balance in allowance account will be 2,400 + 300 = 2,700<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if the percentage was to be based on the balance in accounts receivable you should apply balance sheet approach.<br>  <br>  Balance required in allowance account 60,000 x 4% = 2,400<br>  Balance in allowance account before adjustment ----- = (300)<br>  Adjustment required to be made for bad debts expense=$2,100<br>  <br>  Balance in allowance account will be 2,400

The follow up question is what was the tax appraised value.  If some one has owned a house for many years, it may be under valued on the tax roles.  When you buy a house, the current value is sent to the tax assessor.  So you may take a hit.

f9a39482114c5f9844fc5040ac337bd4aa	Since 1973, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has been the designated organization in the private sector for establishing standards of financial accounting and reporting. Those standards govern the preparation of financial reports. They are officially recognized as authoritative by the Securities and Exchange Commission (Financial Reporting Release No. 1, Section 101 and reaffirmed in its April 2003 Policy Statement) and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (Rule 203, Rules of Professional Conduct, as amended May 1973 and May 1979). Such standards are essential to the efficient functioning of the economy because investors, creditors, auditors, and others rely on credible, transparent, and comparable financial information.<br>  <br>  The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has statutory authority to establish financial accounting and reporting standards for publicly held companies under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Throughout its history, however, the Commission’s policy has been to rely on the private sector for this function to the extent that the private sector demonstrates ability to fulfill the responsibility in the public interest.<br>  <br>  The FASB receives many requests for action on various financial accounting and reporting topics from all segments of its diverse constituency, including the SEC. The auditing profession is sensitive to emerging trends in practice and, consequently, is a frequent source of requests. Requests for action include both new topics and suggested review or reconsideration of existing pronouncements.<br>  <br>  The FASB doesn't set accounting standards in a cocoon. The Board turns to many other organizations and groups for advice and information on various matters, including its agenda. Among the groups with which liaison is maintained are the Accounting Standards Executive Committee (AcSEC) and the Auditing Standards Board of the AICPA, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB), and the appropriate committees of such organizations as the CFA Institute, Financial Executives International (FEI), and Institute of Management Accountants (IMA).

The administrative garnishment would be suspended during either the 7 or the 13.<br>  <br>  You may want to file a "Chapter 20", which is a chapter 7 to get rid of all dischargeable debts and then, when the 7 is done, file a chapter 13 to get a handle on the student loans, if getting rid of the medical bills was not enough.<br>  <br>  If the medical bills are for something that makes impossible for you to earn what you were earning before, you may be entitled to a hardship discharge of the student loans.<br>  <br>  If you have not asked the student loan agency for a forbearance, or applied to the Ford Foundation for a student loan consolidation, with a payment scheduled based on your income, you should do those, whether you file bankruptcy for the other debts or not.<br>  <br>  Consult an experienced bankruptcy attorney in your area.

What are you good at?<br>  <br>  At your age, options are a little more limited.  Problem is, most jobs that will be available to teens will be at organizations that typically create a poor environment, and as a result, they have trouble hiring and keeping good staff.  Even if it is not in fast food, you will probably run into this problem.<br>  <br>  But at least you will be able to make it so that your day is more enjoyable wherever you have to work and you will be able to make it work for you.  If you think in terms of your skills and interests, you'll be able to marry it up with your schooling and career later on.<br>  <br>  Avoid that silly payday site that that other guy is plugging.

Atm74ULtaa	Hey Power of Words, I figure you are a Canadian because you asked about a Social Insurance Number (SIN), not a social security number, which is the American equivalent. Therefore, the other two answers, which are apparently from Americans, are not really helpful because they really don't know the answers to your questions. So, to start, you are certainly old enough to get a social insurance card. My son has his card and he is going to be four years old next month.<br>  <br>  You can get a card from a "Service Canada" office, which are located in all major cities here in Canada. I've included a link below to help you out. You should probably work on getting your card this month so that you will have it for the summer when it comes time to get a job. As for what sort of places hire 14 year old students, well you could try McDonald's, Wal-Mart, Canadian Tire, STAPLES, Home Depot, Wendy's, Burger King, Dairy Queen, Loblaws, Safeway, IGA, Zellers, and other such stores. You could also try and get a job at Canada's Wonderland or the CNE (if you live in the Toronto area) or at a summer camp, or maybe you could work for the municipal government cutting grass. Also, you should ask your friends, ask your parents, and ask your parents to ask their friends about possible employers that they know.<br>  <br>  I know that a lot of young people are not thrilled with the idea of working at McDonald's, but it's not forever and if you do a good job there it will be easier to get a better job elsewhere in the future.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  I hope that you like this answer. If so, please vote for it as the "Best Answer". As you may have noticed, most of my answers include a detailed explanation, so that the person who asked the question can learn from it. This takes more time to write, but is certainly worth it from an educational point of view.|`|AWSmknxLaa	talk to your parents.<br>  <br>  You were assigned a number and a card issued when you were born by the hospital automatically.|`|J3TGyOnDaa	The government gives you your social security number at birth now.

AA11284831	Sorry, but you have it WRONG.  The change is 6.2% refundable credit on your 2009 tax return, capped at $400 for Singles and $800 for married couples filing jointly.  It's advanced to you at approx $13 or $26 per week.<br>  <br>  If your income, exemptions, deductions, etc.are EXACTLY the same in 2009 as in 2008, your take-home pay over the year will be $400 to $800 higher but your refund (or balance due) will be the same as it was this year.<br>  <br>  You actually ARE getting an extra $400 to $800 in your pocket after taxes.<br>  <br>  Additionally, if you have children and a fairly modest income (less than about $40k or so) you will see a MAJOR reduction in your total tax liability due to changes in the Child Tax Credit and EIC.

p3OIPNNKaa	Depends on the states where you worked.  Some states like California require your work to report all wages earned whether they were inside or outside of the state.  Then you have those states that only require wages earned in the state to be reported.  Print out your state returns to see if something is wrong.  I use Turbotax on multiple states and I find it works well.  Make sure you are filling out the residency sections correctly as that can make a large difference.  Sadly, state tax rules have changed to try to squeeze as much money out of you.  For instance, let's say you work in New York and New Jersey - if you sum up the state wages on each state tax return, they will not equal your federal wages.

If you are like most distributors your suppliers are not interested in your problems.

The effects of all the deficit spending will have in the next few years is going to be substantial inflation.

MbzyriZ4aa	Offer a small discount if they take on a larger delivery of your product.<br>  <br>  This way you can order more product and turn around get a better discount from your supplier for buying larger quantities.<br>  <br>  Example: If you buy 10 cases of product X  you receive one case free.<br>  <br>  Or do the cross merchandising deal:<br>  <br>  Buy 10 cases of product X and you get a case of product Z at 20% discount.<br>  <br>  Evaluate your customer's preferences... If one store sells a lot of a certain product they are more likely to agree to buy larger quantities for a discounted price or a "free" case of product.<br>  <br>  Use the second tactic to clean out your warehouse of product that is a slow seller and move them out this way.
RNqRnG86aa	Marketing is an ongoing process of planning and executing the marketing mix (Product, Price, Place, Promotion often referred to as the 4 Ps) for products, services or ideas.|`|cWuumdy7aa	Marketing is defined by the as the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.  The term developed from the original meaning which referred literally to going to market, as in shopping, or going to a market to sell goods or services.<br>  <br>  Marketing practice tends to be seen as a creative industry, which includes advertising, distribution and selling. It is also concerned with anticipating the customers' future needs and wants, which are often discovered through market research.<br>  <br>  Marketing is influenced by many of the social sciences, particularly psychology, sociology, and economics. Anthropology and neuroscience are also small but growing influences. Market research underpins these activities. Through advertising, it is also related to many of the creative arts. The marketing literature is also infamous for re-inventing itself and its vocabulary according to the times and the culture.Product: The product aspects of marketing deal with the specifications of the actual goods or services, and how it relates to the end-user's needs and wants. The scope of a product generally includes supporting elements such as warranties, guarantees, and support. <br>  Pricing: This refers to the process of setting a price for a product, including discounts. The price need not be monetary; it can simply be what is exchanged for the product or services, e.g. time, energy, or attention. Methods of setting prices optimally are in the domain of pricing science. <br>  Placement (or distribution): refers to how the product gets to the customer; for example, point-of-sale placement or retailing. This third P has also sometimes been called Place, referring to the channel by which a product or service is sold (e.g. online vs. retail), which geographic region or industry, to which segment (young adults, families, business people), etc. also referring to how the environment in which the product is sold in can affect sales. <br>  Promotion: This includes advertising, sales promotion, publicity, and personal selling, branding and refers to the various methods of promoting the product, brand, or company.

If your accountant isn't an authorized representative to act on your behalf (meaning you signed a T1013 allowing them to do so) then your accountant can only access your tax information through the CRA by phone and you will need to be there to authorize your accountant to speak to them before they will release any information to your accountant.  If you haven't filed your taxes for a few years as you have said, have your accountant file the missing years and do the carryovers as he goes along and send them to the CRA (via paper file) requesting they be processed in order.  The CRA will be able to tell your accountant whether you've been filing or not and if you have any CRA debt from the past.

AA10259042	They are not a particularly good value.  In fact they are not a good value at all.  You have been mis-informed about how long it takes an EE bond to double in value--to mature.  It currently takes 20 years.  That is right 20 years. The 5 year duration is how long one must hold the bond to not forfeit any interest when it is cashed.  The current rate is 1.3% but it is due to drop again on May 1.  It was 3% just a year ago.  Put the money in a CD with a 1 year duration.  That way when inflation gets going really strong you can roll it over and get a better interest rate.  The only good thing about EE bonds is you do not have to pay tax on the interest until it is paid.  But by then I imagine that the tax rate might be about 50% because the country is completely bankrupt.|`|lys5kB9Daa	I used to work at a bank for a few years and I think savings bonds are stupid and not sound investments.

While banks offer like a half a percent, ING offers 2% and unlike a CD or bond, you can get your money at any time if there is an emergency.

f9a39482114c5f9844fc5040ac337bd4aa	The difference between the two terms is not very well understood for one simple reason: There is not a universally agreed upon definition. <br>  The standard newspaper definition of a recession is a decline in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for two or more consecutive quarters.<br>  <br>  Before the Great Depression of the 1930s any downturn in economic activity was referred to as a depression. The term recession was developed in this period to differentiate periods like the 1930s from smaller economic declines that occurred in 1910 and 1913. This leads to the simple definition of a depression as a "recession that lasts longer and has a larger decline in business activity." <br>  <br>  So how can we tell the difference between a recession and a depression? A good rule of thumb for determining the difference between a recession and a depression is to look at the changes in GNP. A depression is any economic downturn where real GDP declines by more than 10 percent. A recession is an economic downturn that is less severe than that.<br>  <br>  So you're right. A depression IS worse.|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	I've suffered from depression for 15 yrs and I take medicine for it<br>  <br>  an economic depression is far worse than a recession - google the terms - somewhere on the 'net you'll find definitions|`|U9bQgfY9aa	Recessions used to be called depressions which used to be called "panics"<br>  <br>  It is merely semantics.|`|AA11305474	A recession is a downturn in economic activity, defined by economists as at least 2 consecutive quarters of a decline in a country's gross national product.  A depression is an economic condition characterized by falling prices, reduced purchasing power, an excess supply over demand, rising unemployment, accumulating inventories, deflation, plant contraction, public fear and caution and a general decrease in business activity.  Yes, a depression is econmically worse than a recession.|`|c9a1f0964ec1c52f2b99f929391af5d7aa	Best definition I've heard is "A recession is when you lose your job.

Here in Calif., they will admit to >10% unemployed. There are more than that who no longer get unemployment insurance. Grand total is somewhere between 20% and 30%.<br>  <br>  What is really shameful is that the last depression had the same root causes as this one. Deregulation and trickle-down economic bull.

3mAgM405aa	Here's a short list of jobs in the U.S., Canada and Europe which you can create to generate income:<br>  <br>  1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.<br>  <br>  2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.<br>  <br>  3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.<br>  <br>  4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.<br>  <br>  5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.<br>  <br>  6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor. A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a particular real estate listing. The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.<br>  <br>  7. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|UNo489f2aa	Child labor laws, your still protected by them.<br>  <br>  In all other industries apart from agriculture, there is four exceptions to the normal age 16 minimum age:<br>  <br>  (1)    A child of age 14 or 15 may work in an occupation (except in mining or manufacturing) only if the Secretary of Labor determines that such work would not interfere with the child’s schooling or health and well-being.

kho74FORaa	Interesting as my new friend Doocey asked a similar question. He is just 16 years of age but the guidelines I suggested to him fit well with you I believe. First, ask yourself two questions; 1. Can I afford to loose the money that I am investing, 2. Do I want to be aggressive and have a chance to make it big? Okay, so you answer for instance to question 1 yes. Then question 2 is also yes. I would then look for stocks that are in growth mode and have a good chance of going big short term. Now this isn't a inked deal. These type of stocks have good chances of going south on you. More so than making it big. But, like Vegas, its a crap shoot. You can improve your chances in a couple of ways. A. Do your homework, you would not but a house without looking at it first inside and out. Same as a stock. Look at the company, see what type of P/L they display, earnings, dividends, and who the competition is? The ladder being very important and in my opinion, much overlooked by the so-called-experts! I mean would you like to go head to head with Microsoft on a new Program? Probably not. B. If you feel that the information needed to learn about the market is all to complicated, and believe me, I am still a babe in the woods and I have been doing this for over 20 years, then find yourself one good broker. Again, do your homework on this as well. Just because Mary Jones tells you that he is her cousin and a nice boy/girl, doesn't make him a good broker or someone that will fill your needs as you describe. That's just plain stupid. You interview and ask questions. Don't be shy either. Ask him for instance, what type of stocks he holds, does his firm only suggest stocks his firm holds, (this is one I get really upset with....some brokerage firms push stocks on the public because they, the firm, have a major interest in them and the more they sell the better the stock will do, thus, making the firm major money). Will this person answer and explain to you in terms that the common investor understands, (and these are terms that you understand), call you at least once a month and be accessible to your call? In short, this guy/girl is like a employee of that you hire to do a job. Do it right he stays. Do it wrong, kick his *** to the curb. Sorry, that's just how I feel because they will work you hard when you tell them you are about ready to change firms....oh yeah, this is a real attention getter but should not be needed if you and he communicate and are on the same page. And finally, check his costs. Now, with each trade that he executes for you there is a charge that is common to the business. No problem. However, sometimes firms like to add service fees of one type or another or handling charges etc. Be no part of it or look elsewhere. The charge or commission to buy or sell a stock is high enough and no other monies should be of cost to you. Period! Don't let them tell you differently or show them the door. NOW...! Okay, sorry, but that really upsets me. Sort of like the closing costs in escrow with all there little hidden costs, ie; handling, filing, secretary fees, service fees, et al....bull. Hey, TRowe is a good firm. However, I have never been a fan of mutual funds as my buddy Doocey will tell you. They are the long term safe (well, more than not) investments. The three that you have are medium strong as they are now owned by, in my opinion, to many investors making the pie awfully small to divide up. But, nevertheless, not bad. So, there you have your first little lesson in the market. Hopefully you will find some good in what I wrote and I wish you the best and all the good luck your money may buy!|`|IVCS3DbRaa	You have a VERY good mix for your age.

kho74FORaa	The par value of the stock is just that "par". Remember, stock is issued at par value until it goes public. Then the par value of the stock is determined by the majority stock holders, ie: investors, officers of the company etc. as to what they deem reasonable. Obviously they would only issue stock to create cash flow for the business and use in numerous things to build the company. Most companies will set a par value for stock when issued first time at one dollar per share. However, that is not always the case. You can issue a single stock certificate at one million dollars/share if that is what fits your needs.

The judgment will remain on your credit report for years, even if you pay it off.|`|58qjx7XTaa	Going to a collection agency won't necessarily reflect bad on your credit, unless you don't co-operate.  I work for a company that uses them, we use them for large workloads.<br>  <br>  The reason why they harrass is because they want to get paid to.  So try to negotiate something that you can afford.  Offer up a financial questionnaire showing what you have each month and bills and what you have left over.  You can as well offer a settlement, so if you owe $2000 offer $1000 and see if they will take that (for example) that happens all the time.  Make sure you do offer something and don't ignore them or they will get nasty, on that note as well, don't let them walk all over you.  Just because your having a hard time doesn't mean you don't deserve respect.|`|bQJzUgiXaa	Call you and harrass you.  It will be on your credit file and your credit will be shot.  No more credit cards, auto loans or whatever.  But that's about it.  You can also challenge the collections agency.  Tell them that you want to see proof of debt.  That means that they will have to produce somekind of document with your signature on it saying that you aknowledge the debt and promise to pay.  This is called the "note". If they can't do that, then you are debt free.  Legally.

QoVL5cDHaa	Also the Western Morning News has a jobs section on Thursdays. Why don't you advertise there as "job wanted"? Suggest you also try Jobcentre.<br>  I find, too, it's who you know, rather than what you know. Can you call in any favours, and ask around locally?|`|G8zAPz8Maa	Good luck and I just want to make it clear that this is nothing to do with me or my policies|`|3mAgM405aa	Here's a $15-17 per hour night job which is readily available.  Unfortunately, it is not well publicized.<br>  <br>  Check out your local alarm home/commercial provider and ask them if there are openings for an alarm console monitor in which you keep track of any alarms that go off and call the owner's phone to find out why the alarm was going on.  And also obtain from the owner the special password to indicate that no one had access to his alarm system.  And if everything fails, you are responsible for calling in a private patrol service which will visit the alarmed home to check it out.  It's an on-the-job training position which requires that you have a clear unaccented voice and can at least operate a computer with some typing speed.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|HP1pToMOaa	The Evening Herald jobs section out on thursdays.<br>  Good luck.
