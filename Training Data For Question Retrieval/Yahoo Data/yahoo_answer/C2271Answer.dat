3997f747046299c595d0afecef21fdb0aa	Resident Evil 4.  Capcom completely re-vamped the entire system so you're never having to deal with wonky camera angles.  It's a 3/4 view, which means the camera is over the right shoulder of your character, Leon.  The aiming is precise, the scares are in there, and it's a very challenging game.      It's good because it's different from the previous Resident Evil games, in that you're not in Raccoon City.  You're in Europe trying to rescue the President's daughter, who has been kidnapped.  The game is a lot of fun, and it will leave you wanting more.|`|0f107f6de625cb22a047212c486d4979aa	RE 1|`|2b20b9716f383eaaf62c6a72db1039ceaa	Super Monkey Ball.

It is dark and cartoony scary, but requires strategy on how to capture boss ghosts.  Depending on how old you are this may seem crap your pants and cry to mommy scary.  I also had a lot of fun playing it without the repetitiveness of classic horror games (escape the zombie like i wasn't expecting that).  Buy Luigi's mansion.  Here's a link for walkthroughs and cheats though i pray to God that you won't need them because even my 6 year old brother completed the game without help and only took him 4 more hours than me.   www.gamewinners.com

No. Sony sucks, in particular. I bought one several years ago, around the same period PS2 came out, and it was fully advertised by Sony that the PS2 would also play PS1 games, DVDs and music CDs, but....they didn't mention how long it would be able to do that. After 3-4 years, my PS2 eventually stopped playing PS1 games, music CDs, and PS2 games that have a blue disc. It will also barely be able to play DVDs that have been frequently used. Hey, I know that any piece of machinery will eventually break down and be tossed in the scrap heap, but you think with today's technological advancements they build these to last for a very LONG time! It probably won't make much of a difference, but I'm jumping on the Microsoft XBOX 360 bandwagon later on this year. I have had enough of Sony.|`|5121eee78791a80693a140b7e79d7c2caa	i dunno but i had the same problem, im guessing sometimes the disk are to thick and make a wierd scrapping sound and dont load properly.

But some basics might include.    - A decent case if you intend to carry it around a lot  - A psp wired remote (included in bundle, but not in core) if you will be using it heavilly as an MP3 player  - A good screen protector, it should have above average clarity, dont settle for a cheap one    The rest should be bought as the need arises. Enjoy.

(the website is here www.roseonlinegame.com ) but you have to pay for it, so they made a private server of the game, with almost everything the same, the website is here www.ruff-rose.com . its kinda complicated to install, so go search around on the forum, and the website.      EDIT: i found the link for ruff-rose download on the forum, you will have to register to view this, but heres the link   http://forum.ruff-rose.com/index.php?sho...    heres the actual download from another site     http://files.filefront.com/rose_rr_764ex...|`|4e6c47bfed1273512c8d125d7983d89eaa	Actually, as a girl, I've found that Dungeons and Dragons is a fun role-playing game to get into. Most information and games are free, but to start you're probably going to want to buy a player's handbook. I recommend that you find a local Living Greyhawk group and look into tabletop play. Go to www.wizards.com and click on "Living Greyhawk" to get an idea of how to start.    If you're looking for online games, there's one called Adventure Quest, which is all free and fun to play. www.adventurequest.com
Q76bsNp2aa	Try rubies of eventide. (www.rubiesofeventide.com)    It's got like 140 character classes you can choose from and several races you can be. It's true 3-d graphics  (Check out the screenshots here: http://www.rubiesofeventide.com/screensh... )   and is FREE to play!    Not like FLYFF or rapplez where if you want to progress you have to buy things out of their store with real money.. there's no hidden agenda, it's actually free.    And the graphics are much better than the other games I've tried like runescape and maplestory. Some people are easy to please I guess.. they play those :)    Anyway.. there is also several different types of crafting and mining, etc. Lots to do and places to explore. It's a reall fun game.    There aren't a bunch of idiots on it either .. well, depending on the server you choose anyway (the "anything goes" servers are just that) since there are constantly GMs online that moderate the chat, etc.    It's free, give it a try and have fun!|`|mwTYjzQoaa	Yea, I know they suck. Try www.RuneScape.com|`|AA12221964	first of all i do not know where your getting the info that dragon fable or adventure quest is 3D, they are not even good games.i don't really recommend runescape, it gets addivtive and it has bad graphics,bad sound, and ok community(some high levels are nice).i dont know why you dont want a mmorpg, but there is this game called rose online(north american official site www.roseonlinegame.com), but you have to pay for it, so they made a private server out of it, and the link for it is www.ruff-rose.com

c343347efe8852b7e1dedfdbd18ed963aa	the very first level of the game in the first world. Just get the giant mushroom box and when you finish destroying everything you get about 5 lives.    REPEAT REPEAT REPEAT.    Oh and when you hit the giant mush room box, let the mushroom slide to the right for a bit and before it falls into the hole, grab it then you will be able to finsih the level with GIant mario.

6e58b31844f30ea25c15b32953b51750aa	Get the national dex, that is talking to the professor after seeing all 150 pokemon, if you haven't seen Dialga go to the house above the hole in Celestic Town and talk to the old woman. And I'm not 100% sure if you have to do this or not, but I think you need to beat the Elite 4 as well. After that fly to the Pokemon League, go down the waterfall and back into the Victory Road, go onto the bridge, use rock climb down the rocks, go left, then up, turn left past the old man, go up those steps, go down to the bridge, cross it, go up, right and then down, there should be an opening in the wall where a guy is standing, that is how you get there.|`|2bc45a7e433427b9068a60d90f85a56daa	Teh first time you went through Victory Road, there was a guy blocking a cave entrance. Once you get the Nation Dex, go back there and he will be gone. You'll need Defog to get through. route 224 has a shiny rock at the end of it that seems to do nothing, you will need a special Nintendo event-only item to activate it. So far there are no events. I'm pretty sure it leads to Shaymin.

DfgODdW4aa	Poffins help your pokemon in contests (visual part) and also feeding a pokemon the poffins it likes will raise its happiness.  use poffins to enhance the pokemons condition (tough smart beauty cute cool) and if it is high enough the guy will give u the scarf. *ive heard it has to be around 200, which could be done with 10 lvl 20 poffins* there are different scarves for each contest so u should get 5 pokemon and only feed them certain poffins to enhance one condition for each, allowing u to get all of the scarves.|`|RHADBLwRaa	Well if you played Pokemon: R&S poffins are the same as a pokeblock it rasies the pokemons levels of cool,beauty,cute,smart,and tough levels. these levels increase the first round points. they also like you asked some people will look at your pokemon and will give an item determinded by the pokemon conditioning. i hope this helped you|`|Dzffk6S9aa	It depends on the color, for example a pink poffin (sweet) enhances cuteness, so you'd have better luck in a cute contest. You need  ALOT of poffins to get the scarf, but make them high level. My Bannette got full and wouldn't eat anymore, so I didn't get the scarf.|`|fi0QqwoVaa	1. poffin are like the poke blocks of ruby/saphire/emerald they increase your pokemons stats.  2. give it to which ever pokemon you want. but when you go to the guy have that pokemon as the party leader or first pokemon in the order|`|LBxytWUNaa	i think you should try it on one pokemon and see if it works and then use if on the rest pokemon when you need it (thats what i think)|`|CzQ30Ykwaa	they are not proffins they are Poffins. they are a mixture of berries like pokeblocks. they will improve certain qualities of your pokemon such as beaty, toughness, and coolness.

You must have started to do that and came to realize its going to take a while. And Yes it will...    7) Once you have them all then the fun of the hunt and the fun of playing a newly downloaded game is gone.    8) Good luck     9) Here if you read all the above and still want a short cut why not pay for it?   http://www.mamedvds.com/     http://www.lazarus.org.uk/users/subzero/  http://www.mamechick.com/  http://www.mameburning.net/  http://www.freemame.us/  http://www.romburner.co.uk/romsets.htm  http://mame-burner.co.uk/  http://www.geocities.com/dougburton/inde...  http://i.webring.com/hub?ring=mame  http://www.tombstoned.co.uk/burning.html  http://www.us-lazarus.com/rom-burner/ind...  http://www.retro-burner.co.uk/  http://oz.lazarus.org.uk/index.php?join

FhpMTaclaa	it is east of fullmoon island. It is where darkrai is. you can only get there with an action replay or wait for a pokemon event to come out. when it does you can go to the event download the members card. then go to a pokemart. go inside. there should be a man in a green hat. talk to him and he will give you a members card. then go to canalave city at night[about 9 ocklock] go to the locked inn and you should be able to go inside. a guy will put you to sleep right away. you will wake up on fullmoon island. you can go catch darkrai. after you catch him you will wake up. go outside the inn and a sailor will talk to you. you can now go to new moon island on the boat.|`|f04ad9d2bfc596db56ce5b3cbeb41f3baa	its on the upper left corner of sinnoh(map) beside fullmoon island where u get cresselia

xwuTBAlTaa	It all depends on where you're at when you dive and what's in front of you when you dive.    If you're on the 1 and in the goal line formation, you can attempt to dive over the linemen and into the endzone.    If you're by a pylon you can angle your dive to do a one arm extended dive and other various dives.    If you're standing at the goal line, you can dive and he'll just get on his toes and fall into the end zone.    It takes experimentation, dive from farther lengths out but not too far or you won't get in for a touchdown.|`|c9ydS5a3aa	you cant really unless you go to the either sideline then you click dive.  this will make them dive up and over the line or they will jump will 1 arm extended(the arm closest to the endzone)      but its not like madden were they will do summersaults? sp??    and what not into the endzone

2X9HeTcvaa	I bought a brand new 360 and after one day I had that issue of unreadable disks.  The game disc was brand new as well, it turned out to be the disc drive itself.  First I would definitely make sure it's not the disc.  The second thing is that if it is one of the older editions of the console it may definitely have a hardware issue.  If so you're covered by the warranty at least for another year.  I was lucky and traded mine in at the place I bought it.  They gave me a new 360 and I could see a difference in disc drives and now it works 100%.  So if you find it's having trouble with multiple clean disks, it may be worth sending to Microsoft.|`|uogvr1NZaa	im not sure either. we just sent my xbox 360 in for the second time.

Then when you review it, the spot of the ball is way off from where you landed. Plus to when there is video clipping, where your arm goes through another player. Funny stuff. Anyways there are no games that don't have at least one glitch someone complains about. You will have to wait and see when the game comes out. Wish I could play it now and give better information.

ibgPiMFcaa	There is a lot involved in dating (marrying) Muffy. First, he should give her an item every day to raise her affection toward him. Good items are jewelry and items from the dig site. He will notice after a while that the heart that is displayed when he talks to her will change color as she becomes more attracted to him. When the heart becomes red, she likes him enough for marriage. He will also need to upgrade his house, and buy the big bed as well as find 60 harvest sprites before he can marry her.     Here are the basics, but if your son doesnt understand some of them, have him check out the FAQ below. It has info on courting all the characters in the game and hopefully can answer his questions more thoroughly.      http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/ds/file...

Since it will tend to be a heavier yarn, you are going to make something fairly substantial.  There are little looms that you loop these rings over the pegs, and make small squares of fabric, and then stitch them together into whatever you want.  <a href="http://www.historicalfolktoys.com/catcont/4305.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.historicalfolktoys.com/catcon...</a><br>  <br>  You don't even have to cut them up -- use them as they are!  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2141920_use-recycled-socks-doggy-rug.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_2141920_use-recy...</a><br>  <br>  If they are badly worn, you could just cut them up into shreds, or leave them as is, and use it for stuffing of any fabric (or knitted) animals or toys or pillows you are making.

You should go online and look at all the games available. The Xbox 360 has a larger variety of games while the PS3 has sticked more to action games.    The Xbox 360 used to have major problems with its hardware but it seems to have decreased. I have had a 360 for a good year now and the thing hasn't broken once. I also bought an attachable fan for the back of it that helps cool it. That may be something you may consider getting.    I don't know so much about the PS3 yet except that it hasnt had much problems with its hardware (at least not as much as the 360 has). It does though, decrease the quality of previous PSX and PS2 games. Even thought it says its backwards compatible for these games, they look like they've been beaten with an ugly stick.    Xbox 360 will cost you around 500 and the PS3 will cost around 600.    If you intend on playing online, Xbox Live will cost you for a subscription, but this inst horribly exspensive. I'm pretty sure its about 50$ per year. But on the other hand, the PS3's online experience is free.    But like I said before, it all depends on what games you want, so check on http://www.gamerevolution.com/ for a list of games for each system. Happy gaming.

GKAkgeR0aa	There is also another way to get manaphy. To get manaphy you will need to complete the game POKEMON RANGER. After completing the game (Which takes about 15 hours because the story line is short[  i did it in 7 hours]) Acess the RANGER NET and go to SPECIAL MISSIONS. Then press the R button, X button and Left on the Directional pad at the same time to unlock the password option. Imput the password:    P8M2-9D6F-43H7                      ( Its case sensitive)    Then you will unlock RECOVER THE LOST EGG MISSION. Do this mission (which takes only about 20 minutes) To recieve the MANAPHY EGG! WHATS GO GOOD ABOUT THAT? Well, YOU CAN TRADE IT INTO POKEMON DIAMOND AND PEARL!!!!!! After getting the egg go into the ranger net and click check egg. Click on the egg and hit Send to send the egg to pokemon diamond and pearl. YOU WILL NEED A SECOND NINTENDO DS! Inseart pokemon diamond or pearl into the nintendo DS and turn it on ONLY AFTER SENDING THE DATA FROM POKEMON RANGER. While its loadfing it says you are recieving data from poekmonr anger. ITS THE MANAPHY EGG! MAKE SURE YOU HAVE 1 SPACE IN YOUR POKEMON PARTY OR YOU CANT RECIEVE THE EGG! Now start up pokemon diamond or pearl and walk into the nearest poke mart. Talk to the man in green and he will give you the manaphy egg!!!! Now all you have to do is walk or ride your bike 2560 steps  (or more) and walk back into the pokemon mart and walk out again and egg will hatch into a level 1 Manaphy!!!!    Hint: Breed manaphy with Ditto to get Phione!

I am assuming you wwanted a game but before you bought it you got a demo or trial of it. Now the game has a time trial and you have used up all your time on it but you cant exit the game.

mXhFXIdIaa	Right now the xbox 360 is on fire with a great selection of games and anew hdmi port. The ps3 wil be the crushing system soon if youll buy a couple games now then wait until 2008 ps3 will pay off but another ps3 price drop is rumored before holiday when 60gb will run out and 80gb will be all available just a rumor. some games for 360 soon HALO 3, bioshock, mass effect gta4 for both plus madden and stuff for both. Ps3 heavenly sword, lair, killzone 2, mgs4, C. O. D. 4 for both ps3 again rise of argonauts, Beowulf, Turning point: Fall Of Liberty, blacksite area 51, and Ratchet and clank both stranglehold. Ps3 will have all the good games soonand bluray will won. now the stuff you really want.     The ps3 has much more space with bluray notice unlike x360 no insert disc 2 signs with games like lair 25gigs. with amazing graphics and the powerful cell some good games out now the darkness, resistance fall of man ( favorite ps3 game so far), the Bigs Multiplatform and gutair hero ps3 will have wireless controller. it a great system i have it and play it alot free online is great with all downloads and Warhawk will be available on psn full and on bluray with extra video and bluetooth headset. and dont worry sony predicts 10 yearlifecycle and of course all the great ps2 titles perfectly compatible.       X360 premium plus you need 20 gig hardrive if you play alot or elite DONT BUY CORE. has great game library due to year headstart and just recently a price drop games cost 60.00 as do on ps3 as well with the blockbuster HALO 3 and good games like too human xbox live is great but 50$ yearly if you want to actually do something in xbox live. with alot videos and tv shows/movies is agreat feature. and 33 percent xboxes overheat then you need to send them and it takes forever    Im gonna have to say ps3 though with soon to be better games it will be worth it and sixasis is good on certain games lair you will fly dragon with it. it has great dvd format with more space for bigger games on asingle disc plus stranglehold comes with movie. with plenty of games coming soon november septem well fall will have plenty of games for every system plus alot for ps3. so go with ps3 in my opinion i love mine. And a close call but in the end is much better especially once the devolopers know what theyre working with for even better games with better graphics and planty of exclusive and timed exclusive.     Hope this helped i have alot of experiance in this subject hope this essay well it long enogh to be an essay helps you decide. :)     dude i almost forget Home it a coming ps3 feature where you can walk around make your house meet other people earn trophies and invite them to imediate jump in to games good for multiplayer. and also littlebigplanet you make your own levels and have these awsomely cute human creature things go from one end to the other also you can play as litle ppl as well. so hands down    The PS3     Source(s):    psm, personal experience, alot of gaming, me

loAr2zsbaa	Go to Carter & Flora's tent, then go over to the right til you see a hole in the cliff.   Go inside - this is the excavation site - you can dig up jewelry & stuff.   You have to trigger a cutscene with Carter to get the 4 hidden mines in the excavation site.     To trigger the cutscene:   equip your hammer   enter the excavation site either early in the morning or after 9pm - this triggers Carter/open mine scene     All 4 mines are opened this way:   - beat the bottom floor mine creatures of the mine before the one you want to open   - retrigger Carter/open mine scene     Mine 1: 10 floors   Mine 2: 255 floors   Mine 3: 999 floors   Mine 4: 65,535 floors|`|ibgPiMFcaa	I had a similar problem when I restarted the game once. What I think happened with me was that the event did not trigger because I had not yet talked to Carter and Flora. So if you have not yet talked to them, try talking to them and then enter the dig site later at night with the hammer equipped (after 9pm I think). To enter subsequent mines, make sure you have reached the bottom level of the previous mine and then go back to the mine site at night like before and then next one should open.

ME6XV3E7aa	Not that I know of. My friend has read all the books too and fills me in on the plot details every Thursday (pub meet).     I personally think that the flood, and the 'ark' tie closely together in the religious undertones of the game. The ark could refer to a sort of Noah's ark, i.e. earth is the ship if you like, while the universe gets wiped.    Or as in the ark of the covenant (which contains, according to christianity, the ten commandments as appointed by god). And then some super universe wiping after that.    Woooo roll on Halo 3!!!!
AE6rBMUQaa	POGO is a gaming site. If you do not recognize these charges, contact your bank (or credit card company) and advise them that you have unauthorized charges on your card and you wish to cancel them. They (your bank) may be able to give you the phone number to POGO so that you can call them and have them stop future payments.    By calling your credit card company (or bank) they may only credit what's been charged so far, and they may not be able to do anything about future charges.

56fba9120c7fa9880a8270237cfeb1b1aa	I know of 4 The Sims 2 games for Ps2.    1. The Sims 2  2. The Sims 2 Busting Out  3. The Sims 2 Pets  4. The Sims 2 Castaways    I like The Sims 2 Pets, You have to take care of yourself as well as your pets. It is like The Sims 2, but harder. In the Sims 2 Pets you have cash money that you earn from your job and you have Pet  Money that I forgot what it is called that can only be used at the Town Park. There are shops where you can buy toys, treats, kennel pet, wash pet, buy clothes, buy food. It is a great place to make friends and meet new people. You get the Pet Money by teaching your pet commands like sit, stay and by fulfilling there wants.   On the Sims 2 you just have goals and aspiritions and have to go to work and you open up new locations and  when you open up the last location and fulfill everyones gold wants you beat the game.  The Sims Busting out is not one I have played to much, I didn't like it. The story line is you start living in your parents house and you have to fulfill wants and eventually get your own place and job and friends and unlock different locations like in The Sims 2.  The Sims 2 Castaways is pretty cool. Basically you get stranded on an island and you must learn how to fish, gather food, build shelter. There are puzzles that need to be solved  and secrets that need to be found. There is even a tresure map and you have to learn skills so that you can build different types of boats so you can travel to the other islands. All in all it is fun and unique. The apes are your friends and if you have more then 1 Sim that gets stranded you will find them as you explore the islands.|`|ac53eed0ec00a2d980be53069b559e62aa	this is the REAL list of Sims games on the PS2:    1.  The Sims  2.  The Sims Bustin' Out  3.  The Urbz: Sims in the City  4.  The Sims 2  5.  The Sims 2: Pets  6.

0egqoJZSaa	HAVE FUN WITH THESE WAYS! HOPE U GET RICH!  USE THESE WAYS!  Ok hill giants are a good way..take the bones and sell them.  Also 1k regular bones will get you 70k.  Either merchanting, gaining the levels to be able to do better things (such as making runes, or mining rune ores)... But if you don't want to take a long time, you'll have to merchant items... buy low, sell high (if possible)  Level up your woodcutting and cut Yew Trees and sell them.  I recomend this..I am going to give you Ways of making money.    This is by far the best way for F2P players to make cash without taking a lot of time, the only problem is that you would not gain any XP in any skill.    This way is Air Running. Go to World 16. You inventory should have the following Items:    - 1 Air Tailsman.  - 25 Rune Essence.  - 1 free space for money.  - Strange Fruit ( Optional, if you have any, it raises Running by 30% if low).    It is suggested that you do not wear anything energy. You can wear gloves, boots, cape and amulet to look cool, they wont lower your energy or increase you weight.    Now go to Falador, bank, the one closest to the party room. If you know where the Air Altar is then go there. If not, then it is in the woods you will find a stone, a really large one, it s like a space in the map under fally, where there is a space between trees.    Go to the Air Altar then use the Tailsman with it to go in. Trade with someone that is in need of Runes. You might wanna type that you are a runner to get someone, trade with people. Mostly People will give a min of 1.5K and your ess back. If they just offer the money and no ess then don't accept and never accept under 1.5K and your ess back.    The busier the world is, the more money you will get. Usually if it is a bit busy people will give you 2K! Even more. If the world is full, try to go for 3K! You can't gain more than 3K since the new trade limit is here. After you get your money and your ess back in a note. Run back to the bank, swap the notes with the ess then run back there, keep reapeating, the strange fruit comes in when your Energy is 0%, if you don't have it just walk. You can gain up to 50K - 350K per hour from this!  **************************************...  Never do these for money: Mining - Too slow these days. Smithing- Only if you have 95+ then its your call. Pking, really stupid, you don't know the drops or if a player will drop. Monster Killing, what will bones and some cheap random item get you.  HOPE I HELPED!!|`|xuIcsOXcaa	wood cut yews, fish, pk and sell your profits, or hustle        p.s i made 5mill doing this took under 5 months and i only play weekends|`|G10opJ7Zaa	ok, for a nonmember your best chance is to mine runite ore or cut yews but, your best way is to find a side skill (not one in combat) and either use that or kill monsters until u have enough money but, it's really up to merchanting is also helpful, oh also if you become a memer buy like 1250 flax max grand exchange and change into bowstring sell bowstring cheapest grand exchange. and keep it up bowstring is more then flax's max in grande exchange!!!!!!!!!!!|`|ZFLgmNgYaa	Go to G.E. buy as much Tin and Copper as you can (The amounts being equal)    Then go to a furnace and smelt all of them.    Repeat.    You can make 500k in two days doing this    I would also like to suggest if your after XP to try steel and mithril    (Don't try iron unless you are mem)    If you ever become a mem iron is better and use a ring of forging with it and use the furnace in edgeville (right next to G.E.)    Btw buy as many as you can until your buying like 1000 (unless you really want to spend days trying to get rid of 10k bronze ores...)    BTW there is no real fun way to make money on runescape and that is about the only point left to runescape and i hate games like that (that's why I quit)|`|toQ3wrBiaa	Fish or get like 5mil hides.

154dzJ1Faa	Really, the only thing to do is call the store and ask them.  There might be other questions that you have, or they may have about what you are looking for, and you are the only one that knows that.  I would have to call them for you, ask them, they would ask me something about it, then I would have to send you a note, ask you about it, then get back to the store.... It would be just so much easier if you would do that yourself.  Then you would know much faster, as we say here "right from the horses mouth".      Always go to the source.|`|355eaa9a887f7e3265541cc03a47d662aa	I recall that they do.  But, Michaels is such a ripoff!  Don't shop there!

GiBEGUTIaa	What's up,  The Wii and PS3 are two totally different systems..  To play games with your child the Wii is definitely the way to go..  Here are some of the cool games that I  play with my kids on the Wii :    Super Mario Galaxy     Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, The    World of Goo      Mega Man 2    Super Smash Bros.    Metroid Prime 3: Corruption     Tetris Party    Ninja Gaiden    Mario Party 8  Star Wars Unleash  Wii Fitt  Wii Sports    Now the PS3 is the way to go for graphics and the sound to match that HDTV and Sony receiver that you have...    I said that you don''t like violent games  So check out these games on the PS3 like:    LittleBigPlanet   Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction      Castlevania: Symphony of the Night   Bionic Commando Rearmed (An Old School Classic)  Rock Band 1 & 2: Special Edition   Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords  Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion,    Racing Games:(PS3)  WipEout HD  Gran Turismo 5 Prologue   Pure   MotorStorm 1 & 2  Burnout Paradise     Need For Speed...Undercover,Prostreet,Carbon      But if wanted to get into great shooter:(PS3)  Grand Theft Auto IV     Resistance 1 & 2 (Collector's Edition)    Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots    Fallout 3 (Collector's Edition)      BioShock     Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare    Far Cry 2   Unreal Tournament III   Warhawk (Online Only)  Mercenaries 2     Good Sports Games (PS3)    Pro Evolution Soccer 2008   Madden NFL 09: 20th Anniversary Collector's Edition    NHL 09  Sports       NBA 2K9  FIFA 2009    Xbox has some awesome graphies and great games as well  but the draw back for me with XBOX is that you have to pay to play online...    God Bless |`|HimBbU6caa	If you are a grown man and are a video game fan the PS3 or the Xbox360 is the way to go. The Wii is not a next gen console. Nintendo is an amazing company that will always have their niche, but I'm not shelling out $250 of my recession proof dollars for games that look like that. I am a sports game fan and all of the cross console sports games on the Wii are visibly inferior to their PS3/Xbox360 counterparts.|`|XZJusPZcaa	It all depends on YOU. if you loved mario and stuff the wii has some great games! PS3 On the other hand will match your HD tv and make your gaming experience AWESOME. If you want something to sit back and play occasionally wii is awesome, but if you want something to play lots ps3  gives you more option!    IF you want some good advice, go xbox 360!  The 360 has the widest variety of games to play and its just better!|`|nBLaaBWcaa	if ur more into jus the plain old video games then i suggest a game cube because they make like the best games 4 it but i guess in ur case PS3 is best|`|c02d233b2fa253c3dfa66966175deb6aaa	I will be honest with you I am a hardcore gamer, I have been playing through out all games available on the Wii, N64, Psx, PS2, PS3, I dont like Microsoft, but thats another story.    If you are looking for enjoyment with your child, Wii will be a good option, but if you are looking for a good time, enjoy some very nice graphics, PS3 will be the best, OR if youa re just like me, that cant decide, then get both... XD    For Ps3 you can get some racing good games, NFS Undercover, Burnout Paradise, GTA 4, some very good stories, Assassins Creed, Heavenly Sword... old games of course, but new ones are comming out.    For Wii, Mario Kart Wii, Resident Evils... Zelda Twiilight Princess, ETC... so hope that helps you decide, just for you to have an idea. Wii is Marketing, Ps3 is Power, so what do you want? I will choose Power eventhough I have both.
gGZz2EGyaa	How about embroidery, using wool instead of proper embroidery skein and doing the initials in daisy stitch.  You could make the shape of a teddy bear and put the initials on the bear's tummy. Sorry I cannot come up with anything outstanding other then that, perhaps one of the answerer's will have another way to personalise the blanket.|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	You could embroider a small rectangle of white r cream cotton and stitch it firmly to the corner.|`|AA12343169	find some knitter's graph paper, available on the web. http://www.thedietdiary.com/knittingfien...  then graph out his initials. You can embroider it by using the duplicate stitch, see the instructions link below.   http://www.purlbee.com/duplicate-stitch/  http://knitting.about.com/od/knittingski...  You can try cross stitch. You can actually knit in the intials using purl bumps. Basically you knit until you get to one of the places where the initials would go, and purl one stitch. that way you can create the initials in kind of a relief. To find samples look for knit washcloth patterns.|`|Z933rtuLaa	Everybody else has given much better answers than I'm about to, but I'm gonna answer anyway!    In my family we have many garments, particularly Christening blankets, that have passed through the generations.

bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	No, a violent video game can not make you a bad person, nor a violent person.  Many parents believe that any 'violence' seen on TV or in a game makes the child more violent, but I had a child who would get violent UNLESS I made him watch at least one 'violent movie' and or play at least one to two hours of violent games per week.  On that 'diet' he was an absolute 'lamb' with no violence!  He's grown now and on his own, and owns several of each kind of violence, because he knows his 'tendency' and has the good sense to 'deal with this problem' himself.  Psychologists told me to 'have him put into a home for violent offenders' when he was 3 ... I refused, and now he's a wonderful young man, successful and happy, who lives on his own, supports himself, and likes to watch a violent movie or play a violent game once a week!  Sometimes what people think is the 'cause' is truly the 'cure' for violence!|`|sX0dKXzRaa	no, your only playing game so whats wrong with that.|`|kdSuwt8paa	No but it might very well encourage or even create inappropriate reactions in real life.|`|8OUegINnaa	No, I don't think so.|`|rTwsdq6kaa	well ah if you have a strong mind and you don't get influenced by it and just play it for fun. hey look at the bright side, it could help with strategy and good coordination|`|0a75be6d2cd221907147fab2adf72bbeaa	Nah not a bad person.  And really I don't think it will make you violent either.  My brother plays games like that, and sometimes he acts kind of violent and gross, but at the same time, I have friends who are active players and they're completely different from the way he acts. I've even played some of his games before and I don't feel any different. I guess it really depends on what kind of person you are :)|`|r22addgJaa	I don't believe that playing violent video games makes you a bad person. I believe that this is a way that kids can get rid of some agression. However, I do believe that if the kids only play violent games, they will learn to deal with things in a violent way. Check this out: http://www.akatoo.com/question.html?ques...|`|5lmylCcGaa	No, bad parenting makes you a bad person, they just need something to blame it on|`|t94CZkY2aa	Nothing can actually make you a "bad" person. However playing violent games can lead to desensitization which in turn can trigger the violent thoughts and/or feelings that are already there. It is kinda like feeding into the negativity, in the way the brain reacts to over stimulation, by forming a familiar violent reflex reaction that can lead to, in some cases, a predisposition to violent behavior.|`|aJSUlD0Baa	No it does not. I have been playing violent video games since I was a kid (28 now) and I'm not violent. Parents and the government use this kind of thinking so they have someone to blame for kids attitudes today instead of the parent saying it was my fault for not raising my child right.|`|L6ds9cnDaa	No!    It makes people think you're a psycho maniac because you've shot a virtual gun.    It's the dramatization because some insane kid in Singapore went and robbed someone/killed a cab driver because he 'saw it on GTA.'    But alas, if you play a video game then think 'Oh, i'm going to go kill someone now!' you are a bad person. Or clinically insane, you pick.|`|tjBF7xRyaa	It only turns u into a bad person If you renact it in real life|`|WLU2o0ejaa	Playing them ? - Of course not.  It's how you behave after playing them.  That has to do with choosing your behavior, decisions, judgments, etc.  You still need a good foundation of right and wrong and good solid morals.  Gaming can be a good vicarious outlet.  Just know when to stop and what's real and not.|`|qpxPW5paaa	Yes, its right up there with rape and child molestation|`|YkseyT7zaa	If your a person that can distinguish the difference between a video game and real life, then you're fine|`|Run7dyraaa	no, it may just make you a violent person|`|aBqJhdufaa	Nope.

f3b6c192f7f7186b48a7ef3f38930bfaaa	Ok, this is a very lengthy answer.    Clefable is a good pokmon, but by a competitive standard it's outshined by Blissey.  Clefable's main use is to soak pu special attacks, and in the underused environment it does that fairly adequetly, since Focus Blast and Aura Sphere aren't common there.    Abilities:  Magic guard is the one to go for.  It protects Clefable from indirect forms of damage.  Spikes, Stealth Rock, Sandstorm and Hail are very common, so providing an immunity to this is incredibly helpful.  Cute charm has some potential uses against physical attackers but it is fairly situational.  There's no guarantee that the oppoment is the opposite gender to Clefable.  However, if it comes into play, it can be seriously crippling, especially if you take Thunder wave into account.    Moveset 1: Special wall.  Item: Leftovers  Ability: Magic Guard  Nature: Bold (-Atk, +Def)  Moonlight  Sing/Thunder Wave  Thunderbolt  Ice Beam    A pretty straightforward Clefable.  Moonlight and Leftovers can help keep Clefable active and help absorb special attacks.  The choice between Thunder Wave and Sing is split.  Thunder Wave has 100% accuracey and causes paralysis, which can be given to many pokmon.  However, ground types are immune to it and pokmon such as Quagsire are fairly common.  Sing completely immobilizes a pokmon, but it is unreliable and if a pokmon falls asleep, it activates the sleep clause, meaning only one pokmon on a team can be asleep at any one time.  Thunderbolt and Ice beam provide great type coverage.  It's a tactic known as Bolt-Beam and is only resisted by the Magnezone family and Volt absorb Lanturn's.  The latter is very common in the Underused Tier so you should really have a counter for it in your team.    Moveset 2: Choice Specs.  Item: Choice Specs  Ability: Magic Guard  Nature: Bold (-Atk, +Def) or Modest (-Atk, +Sp.Atk)  Thunderbolt  Ice Beam  Shadow Ball  Focus Blast    A special wall for Choice Item based teams.  It's pretty self-explanetory but requires prediction to pull off sucessfully.  Thunderbolt and Ice beam are standard, providing great type coverage.  Shadow ball hits Ghost type pokmon, such as Rotom and Driftblim  Focus blast hits Steel type pokmon, most notibly Magnezone wihch resist the other three moves.  However, it has unreliable accuracy which can be make or break.    Moveset 3: Calm mind offence.  Item: Leftovers  Ability: Magic Guard  Nature: Modest (-Atk, +Sp.Atk)  Thunderbolt  Ice Beam  Substitute  Calm Mind    A tactic known as Sub-stalling.  Set up a substitute and Calm mind away.  Eventually, your Substitutes will be nearly impervious to special attacks, allowing for full leftovers recovery, and physical sweepers will be OHKOed by Clefable's Attacks.  It is performed better by other pokmon, but it is still an option.    Other optional moves: Return, Focus Punch, Meteor Mash, Thunderpunch, Ice Punch, Fire Punch, Flamethrower, Fire Blast, Psychic, Grass knot, Swagger, Stealth Rock, Snatch, Reflect, Light Screen, Safeguard, Toxic, Rest, Sleep Talk, Seismic Toss.    Return, Body Slam, Focus Punch, Meteor Mash, Thunderpunch, Ice Punch and Fire Punch comprise what is effectively Clefable's viable Physical movepool.  Clefable isn't as good with Physical attacks as it is with Special attacks, but they are options.  Note that Body Slam and the elemental punches require a Clefable from Emerald, and as such can't be used with Magic Guard.    Flamethrower, Fire blast, Psychic and Grass knot are other special moves Clefable has availible to it.  Flamethrower and Fire Blast also cover against Steel Types but leave Clefable open to many rock types, most notibly Sudowodo.  Psychic can hit fighting and poison types but not much else.  It is viable to cause a worry for Machamp and Toxicroak.  Grass Knot hits many water types, Quagsire in particular,  Be mindful that the damage depends on the weight of the target.    Swagger can be used with Thunder Wave for a Para-fusion effect, but it does leave Clefable open for physical punishment.    Stealth Rock is useful for setting a trap for the oppoment, but there are better users of stealth Rock.    Snatch is a Use with prediction or don't use at all move.  If used correctly, it can be absolutely crippling.  Stealing a Vileplume's Aromatherapy can be very useful, as can stealing a target's stat-up attempts.    Reflect, Light Screen and Safeguard are support options that Clefable has.  Generally, Xatu is better at this, but it is an option.    Toxis is just another status move that can be used on Clefable.    Rest and sleep Talk provide another form of self-recovery.  It can be sueful for absorbing sleep statuses for your team and forcibly activating the sleep clause against a target you know has a sleep move, but the current battle format is too fast for Rest-talking.    Seismic Toss provides a fixed damage option for Clefable.  Note that it has t be obtained from the 3rd generation games, so can't be used with Magic guard.|`|FAQAYSgVaa	Ice beam and toxic r good to stay but make sure that u have a strong sp attack cause cosmic power is better if u want clefable to be a defensive pokemon.

oHmSa4zbaa	dono|`|8axPfFRFaa	I assume your refering to your nat settings as in they are set to either open, moderate or strict.  If this is what you mean my nat settings always change to strict when im playing my 360 and it causes online gameplay problems. The only way I know how to change them is by resetting your broadband router e.g a BT home hub for instance.  After I have reset my router I test my network settings on my console (I assume you can do that for your ps3) and they are on open. I hope this is what you mean and I hope it helps otherwise I'm sorry.

You can only fight with him after you defeat the MCP (Space Paranoids). After you defeat him, you must talk to Cloud (you can see him at Market Place of Radiant Garden/Hollow Bastion).

ibgPiMFcaa	The cave near the tent is the dig site, and this is where the mines are opened from. The mines are not automatically open, you have to trigger a scene with Carter (the guy who works in the mines) in order to unlock them. In order to trigger the scene that unlocks the mines, you have to enter the dig site late at night (between 9 and 12pm) with the hammer equipped. After the scene you will have opened the first mine. To open subsequent mines, you must have reached the bottom level of the previous mine and then you have to repeat the procedure above with Carter.     This is the basics on how to unlock the mines, but mining can get a lot more complicated and would take awhile to explain everything. The FAQ below is very helpful and has a whole section on mining that can help to answer your questions more thoroughly.    http://www.gamefaqs.com/portable/ds/file...

First time through, i probably put about 10-15 hours in.  But there's also getting 3 glyphs in every stage, and Hell mode is unlocked after beating it on normal, so there is some replay to it, tho not a lot if you're not into tougher difficulty or getting high points to get the 3 glyphs per stage.  It is a very very good game tho, so i would definitely play it if you have a PS3, at the very least rent it.|`|boS1ScMHaa	I wouldn't call them a good gamer because there just rushing thru it, I can beat the first mario in 10 minutes but my score will be no more than 10,000. beating a game that fast kinda defeats the purpose of buying it for $60 if its only gonna sit on the shelf a couple hours after you just bought it.

Thats the price of going to 2 movies (without pop and popcorn) in a month and potentially WoW provides more hours of entertainment. Maybe eliminating another expenditure could allow you to have the money for your own account.|`|nVrAVG6Paa	you can do this, sure its against the rules but they cant stop you from sharing 1 account on 2 computers and if they ever did ask you could just tell them somthing simple like somtimes i have to stay at my grandmothers and i play it on her computer. i often log onto my account at my freinds houses and nothing has ever happened.

fvre0o9laa	Your question is a little like asking what shoes should you buy... sewing machines are something you really need to try for yourself before you decide to purchase.  I've sewn on a lot of different types and brands of machines over the years... some of them instantly feel like old friends, and some feel like I've suddenly sprouted toes in place of my fingers.    And rather than a single combination machine, many people find that they prefer a sewing machine and an embroidery only machine.    Some inexpensive machines are nearly impossible to find parts for.   Others are just not going to hold up for long.  Still others are so inaccurate that it really makes sewing quite difficult.  And dealer services, particularly guide classes, can be important to learning to use a machine with minimal frustration.      So I'd suggest going out and trying various machines at the best local dealers around, and listening to how the dealership is doing.  And, though I hate to be a pessimist, ask who handles warranty service if the dealership folds... with some manufacturers, you then have to send the machine to the factory for warranty service.    Go, try, play.  Take your time in choosing a machine... there are a lot of good ones out there, and some not so wonderful ones.  Check with places like the machine reviews at http://www.patternreview.com when you get things narrowed down a bit.  Make yourself a comparison checklist of features you want.  Attach samples you've sewn with your own fabric and thread to your checklist for comparison.  Try a machine a couple of times before you make your final selection.    My personal preferences are for Elna, Pfaff, Viking, but there are a lot of other brands out there that are wonderful machines.  Bernina, for instance, does excellent stitching -- but they're one of the brands that makes me feel like I've got toes instead of fingers.  You won't know what kinds you get along with unless you try them.     Is there a reason you want to sew backwards for extended periods?  The feed dogs are usually less accurate feeding in reverse, fwiw.|`|6N3yjlXhaa	Hi, AT.    With a budget below $1,000 you will not have many choices in brands that sew and embroider.    Some sewing machines hint at embroidery, but all they have is decorative stitching.  These would be less expensive than a sewing/embroidery machine.    I would choose Brother.  It is user friendly and if purchased from a dealer, you will have support if needed.    You may be able to find a good price on a more expensive used brand at a reliable dealer.    Visit dealers and test run their machines, then buy the one YOU like best from the dealer you like best.    The method of activating the reverse function is fairly universal in all brands and you do not want to sew in reverse any more than is absolutely necessary.  This function was originally intended for locking the the end or beginning of a seam.    Sewing machines generally do not have a serger feature and if they do it is less than desirable.  Only a serger can give accurate results.    Best wishes.    PJ|`|BhFeii5Xaa	I would not have either of those machines anywhere near me. Singer used to be a very good machine and if you can find one over 25 yrs old it will be a good deal. Singers now are made off shore and are not what they were. The same with the Brother machines. They are cheap, cheap, cheap and you will have nothing but trouble with them.    I have not seen a machine since they put electric motors on them that you don't have to hold the reverse button or knob the whole time you are doing reverse.    I would look at the Bernina or the Janome machines. Go to the sales rooms and try them out. This is why they have machines on display for people to try them and make up their own minds.    If I were you, I would not be afraid of spending more money on a very good machine. I have been a proud Bernina 830 owner for more than 40 years. I expect this machine to still be around for another 40 years. Even tho they no longer make parts for this particular machine, not much can go wrong with it. 40 years ago it was in the neighborhood of $1000!! I went into debt and paid monthly on my machine.    I thought I wanted a serger and got one. $2500 worth of trash!! It is way more trouble than I really want to deal with. It only takes me 3 hours to change thread colors!!
vAAewOnQaa	Spore creature creator isn't such a main game. You can use it to create your monsters and test them out, but you cant really go anywhere with them. The main game 'Spore' is to come out September 7th 2008, its said to be the most anticipated game of 2008. The creature creator makes the creatures for this game.  Hope your brothers gets the game, I'd advise to pre-order it EVERYBODY wants it :P|`|0E2JLBs1aa	The Spore Creature Creator justs lets you make the creatures.

For a kinda chat with nicely customizable avatars, I would suggest Gaia Online (which is anime)  Or there is Runescape (although these days it isn't that good)  But you know, if you really want a good game, you are gonna need to cough up the big bucks, and that will get you World of Warcraft or Guild Wars.|`|lhek8CMRaa	Below are some anime style mmorpg, hope you can find you need.    maple story http://feature.mmosite.com/maplestory/  a great MMORPG by Nexon(KR).

ENsvvLcfaa	If I remember correctly, you need to run it with administrator privileges.    If you have a shortcut of War Rock on your desktop:  1.)Right click on it, then choose the "Properties" selection  2.)Go to the compatibility tab and check the box where it says "Run as Administrator".  3.) Click "Apply", and I think you should be good.    I'm not 100% sure that's the solution though...

M6Je0FaVaa	Okay mate  You can either buy a Pandora Battery of Amazon (10/$15)  or you can make one yourself by following the Youtube Guide in the description.    As far as i know the official Sony v5.00 firmware maybe unhackable, but give it a good go. As im sure it will be.  If it isnt..  Dark Alex will release some program soon to Downgrade it.  Sooner or later it will work :)|`|c02d233b2fa253c3dfa66966175deb6aaa	Only advise is to get a Pandora Battery, but unfortunatly to make it you will need to get a PSP with CFW... so unless you got a friend to help you out, you can buy one battery for that case for around $10 here    http://www.dealextreme.com/details.dx/sk...

XNFGslibaa	When there is recoil your gun will move, which in turn moves your crosshair.|`|Kj02Sqseaa	It is a hack which increases a players accuracy dramatically.

With no recoil, i removes this movement and allows the player to shoot accurately at all times, whether they are unloading, moving, jumping, etc.|`|AA11725144	recoil is a word explaining the kickback on a gun    example of high recoil would be like if you took a single shot and it made your gun move a lot making it hard to aim    low recoil would be a single shot and having your cross hairs basicall stay in teh same spot    no recoil would be no moveent of the gun when firing constantly

cx9WeQJBaa	Don't believe that falador bargain deal its a major scam.  Best way to get Summoning up ive found so far is by slayer which u both as all slayer monsters drop charms often. You will both get slayer xp and charms thus leveling 2 skills at once. Summoning is very costly and i know cause i have lvl 44 summoning and to say i probably spend about 500k or more so far total. If not already done you could do quests such as troll stronghold and use the 2 10k lamps for use on summoning that will boost u up there. Now getting the second ingredients is a different story as the body part or item needed is something that can possibly be bought at G E or found elsewhere.    Any more help needed id be glad add me on R S  my name is which is lvl 92.     Dr_Payne_1|`|zaDxQFheaa	WELL..... all you have to do is...

Slayer creatures are good droppers of those so do plenty of slayer assignments. If possible find a multicombat area to do your fighting in so you can actually put those familiars to good use.  Making the pouches is where you get most of your summoning XP but you also get some from bringing the creature into play & using it's special ability scrolls. The ones who forage stuff or create stuff like the spirit spider, ibis , granite lobster , beaver & such are great to use outside combat. They'll easily pay for themselves.

Both are terrific and lengthy journeys into a beautiful and breathing universe. Both also feature amazing, deep stories and an incredible amount of detailed side quests and exploration. The great but grimy graphics created by the use of browns, greys and sickening yellows give Fallout 3 a realistic atmosphere where survival will be on the forefront of your mind. Mass Effect on the other hand features smooth, futuristic graphics that establish the sci-fi universe and generate a crazy amount of detail. The graphics in both game takes absolutely nothing away from the gameplay. Mass Effect features many movie like cutscenes but the most immersive ones are the scenes in which you can control your characters speech and actions. Both have shooting but in both the shooting isn't the main focus of the games so they may be different that your other shooting games. Also if you play these games on medium or hard they can provide a fun and though provoking challenge. Character and personality in these games also draw you into these politically flooded and open universes in which many choices must be made. The choices you make also provide insane amounts of replay value... whether you wish to be a renegade, paragon or somewhere in between or gain good, evil or neutral kharma changes the storyline for each playthrough. I guarantee you you will have a blast with any of these two games.

Hope this helps?|`|	in the beginning you should have said its name for awhile until he/she keeps looking at you from that point it should have learnt it, and you have to say it clearly as possible|`|	Pronounce the name clearly, and don't get too close to the mic. if you dog doesn't learn its name you might want to restart and buy a new dog :[|`|	Try this:  Whenever you are on the 'Home' screen, click your dog's picture. A light bulb MAY appear in the top right-hand corner of your screen. If it does, click it and say the dog's name clearly, as you did when you first taught it. If it understands, it will bark once, if not it makes a confused sound. Repeat this and eventually, it will learn the name. I hope I helped! Good luck with your puppy. BTW, what breed is it, I have nintendog lab & friends too. :]

I like the storyline in 10, but I like the way 12 is played (actually being able to see the monsters instead of running in to them, as well as the use of gambits).|`|5CuN9h20aa	Final Fantasy.|`|Mdj7QalPaa	Final Fantasy all the way|`|c8tyG5z3aa	Kingdom Hearts, it's cute, and I like playing in Disney worlds.|`|FbcJq0ioaa	Kingdom Hearts.|`|3enLWKoEaa	definelty final fantasy   kingdom hearts' plotline is a little too corny for me  all the cartoon characters are stupid and the games just arent as fun. Final fantasy games are longer, more challenging.... and in the end you'll feel like your getting more fun for your money!  i have played and own both series btw!|`|2wjOK6Wjaa	Final Fantasy hands down.|`|012c00f3aed6127a6a10506a53fbc105aa	YOU ARE CRUEL!!!!! HOW DARE YOU PUT MY FAVORITE SERIES IN A COMPETITION AGAINST EACH OTHER!!!!    Sorry, for writing in caps, but I had to get that off my mind. lol. My favorite series is the Final Fantasy series. FFX made this possible.     Again, you're a cruel man... very cruel.|`|576e76ca46b6c4293f45926a8e75773caa	Ugh... I love them both so much.  FFVII and KH2 are both my favorite games of all time.  I think I like FF a slightly bit more than KH, but it's VERY close.|`|XscVe0AYaa	Definitely Final Fantasy...KH is OK but too kiddy...FFIV and FFVII were my favs.|`|FVDbVcnCaa	FF X and 7 were the best, but Suikoden 1 - 3 were better than both of those series combined -_-
Ha1s0rfBaa	The PS3 is the obvious choice here. In short, it has better reliability, multimedia capabilities, a large list of exclusives and more coming out in 2009 and in the future, it will have over-the-top graphical capabilities (google Heavy Rain). And to those who say the Xbox 360 is cheaper, well then just look at the following list:    With the PS3, you get:  -A Blu-Ray player, which if you wanted one of equal value would blow at least a $700 hole in your wallet, plus a mean DVD-upconverter  -Free online service, the Playstation Network, which is only a few steps behind Xbox Live these days  -An ever-growing list of exclusives, like Resistance 2, LittleBig Planet, Motorstorm: Pacific Rift, Metal Gear Solid 4 and in the future: inFamous, Killzone 2, God of War 3, Uncharted 2, L.A. Noire, Heavy Rain and Massive Action Game (M.A.G.in which over 256 players will be able to play on the same map at the same time)  -More flexible in terms of hardware, e.g. swappable HDD, USB mini cable, etc.  -Built in, superior Wi-Fi  -Web browser  -A super sleek system complete with chrome trim and a slot loading disc drive    With the Xbox 360, you get:  -DVD Player/upconverter  -Xbox live, which is $60/year, and not even worth it  -Halo 3 and Gears of War 2 (thats a lot of exclusives compared to the PS3, if you ask me: P)  -Ummcant really say anything about non-proprietaryness, because Microsoft inflates the prices for their accessories.  -A 1 in 3 failure rate (it's not "if", it's "when")  -Many people are on their 5th or 6th 360's already because of RROD, and my friend is on his 11th!    So heres a quick run-down of what you must buy with the PS3 and 360:    PS3:  Console $400  Game $60  Controller $55  Charger $2-10--any USB mini cable will do  Total: $517    Really, if you bought all the things the PS3 offers SEPERATELY, you would be able to buy roughly 3 PS3's with that money.    Xbox 360:  Console $300  Game $60  Controller $60  Play and Charge kit x2 $60  Xbox Live $60  Wi-Fi $100  Total: $640    Thats not cheaper, so get a grip on it! Sony said that they made the PS3 to last a decade. The multi-platform games are using about 25% of the PS3's graphical potential. So there's lots of wiggle room in the future for much more brighter, detailed and massive environments.    On the other hand, most multiplatform games are using about 98% of the 360s potential. And they look about the same. At this rate in 1 year, the PS3 will have outshone the 360 graphic wise. Its just that the 8-core Cell Broadband Processor is very complex, and takes developers time to get used to. And they are getting the hang of things. The PS3 has a very good reliability rate: only 0.2% failure rate (note the decimal), while Xbox 360's have a 30% failure rate. So, for every 1000 of both consoles produced, 2 PS3's are defective, whilst about 330 Xbox 360's are defective. The numbers speak for themselves. Many game developers have OPENLY stated that in the near future, and right now, they will use the PS3 as a lead-developing platform, and then they will port the games to the 360.    Also, many Xbox fanboys will say "Sure, LIVE is 60 bucks a year, but you get what you pay for." Isn't this like a Sony fanboy saying "Sure, PS3 is a 100 bucks more, but that is *pretty much* all you pay for?    So in conclusion, the PS3 is betteryou get the most bang for your buck, and it's an incredibly advanced all-in-one home media center hub. You can even install Linux or Windows XP and use it as a computer-legally! While with the Xbox 360, Microsoft will ban your 360 from certain things, if you install the OS at all (just try to bypass the security).    Hope this helps!|`|MMExegjpaa	360 :good  LIVE is awesome   Netflix  Nice controller  Game play is sweet  Lots of Games to choose from  Play music while your playing a game  Its cheap  Xbox market place    360:bad   LIVE costs you  Red Rings   No wireless internet connection  Loud  Scratches games with tray  has a 33% chance of failing  laggs alot    PS3 :good  Awsome graphics  Bluray player   HOME  Not loud  Wireless conection  Can us any bluetooth headset  free PSN (online)  six axis movement (like the wii)  Playstation store  backwards compatible  Gameplay is sweet  Coming out with a bunch of games  Browse websites  Doesnt scratch games    PS3 : bad  has a 0.03 chance of failing (not much of a percant)  laggs a little barley on online  cant listen to music while playing       I say get a ps3 much better the 360 And if your going on price save up dont waste your money on the 360   The ps3 is only 400 bucks  its worth the wait|`|ecOfV8Blaa	Xbox - Live makes it much better.

X8AIyopmaa	The second TV only displays at a max of 720i and the first one has a max of 1080P. For 50 dollars more than the other I would definetely go with the one with the higher resolution, especially if you're going to be playing PS3 or 360 on this TV.

I think you do have to be connected to the internet for wii, but that's just for certain channels.|`|SCivbcH4aa	It depends what you want to do with it.   Lets go over some of the Pros and Cons  Pros of the Playstation 3  -Better Graphics  -There are more games geared towards adult audiences (shooters, etc) (this could be both a con or a pro, depending on what you want to use it for)  -Has a free internet multiplayer system  -Has a Blu-Ray drive (A Blu-Ray disc is similar to a DVD, but higher definition)    Cons of the PS3   -Its much more expensive than a Wii (Wii=about $200 PS3 = about $400)  -There is a relatively small selection of games for the PS3      Pros of the Wii  -More Family themed games, but there are plenty of shooters for it (again could be a con or pro)  -Innovative controller   -More games than the PS3  -Cheaper  -Because it is a simpler system than the PS3, it is much more reliable (it breaks a lot less)  -It's very party-friendly    Cons  Doesn't have as good graphics as the PS3  Isn't focused on shooting games    If you are a hard core gamer who likes shoot-em-ups, you'll probably want to buy the PS3, if your willing to pay double.  If your not as interested in that kind of thing, and want a system you can play with your friends than you probably want the Wii|`|kSKHpcqEaa	wii and ps3 r tied they both have great games like madal of honor heroes 2 for wii and mr.clank for ps3 wii vs ps1 and ps2  wii wins because has better graphics  and u do not need internet|`|XcvBcgiRaa	The wii

JTrWRUBiaa	Buying/selling an account is against the terms of service written by Blizzard. If they find out you bought an account, you will likely get it banned.    I highly doubt you buying something from the AH (Auction House) is one of the ways they find out who buys accounts.    Ive bought and sold WoW accounts before, and had no trouble using the AH with the accounts I purchased.    I did get one account banned once for power leveling my characterhowever, this was probably discovered through tracing IP address changes, which is not at all related to the AH.    Long story short: You may possibly get your account banned in the future (though its less likely if you havent already been caught), but if you do, it will probably not be through AH stuff.|`|d687892f30736bf6e8c5cafa8508dfc4aa	They have no way of telling that you purchased your account when you shop on the auction house. So you're safe. If they find out that the account traded owners though elseways you could get in trouble.|`|YM6MrT8Xaa	Is buying an account legal? I don't think it is so by right the account should have been banned outright just for listing it on eBay with intent to sell, as that is the usual punishment for selling an MMO account illegally. If you haven't been caught you are probably in the clear, but the potential for being banned still exists.    Depending on the account you bought, it might not be noticeable and no one will think twice about it, or you could be the WoW Jenny Spitfire mk6 (avid PVPer turned hard core carebear, changed hand about 6 times), and everyone will know you are different.|`|E047GSKdaa	Unethical.

012c00f3aed6127a6a10506a53fbc105aa	The CD key is usually on a sticker on the back of the CD case. If it's not there, check the inside of the case. And if you can't find it there, check the box that the game came in. Most likely it'll be on the back.    If you still can't find it, I suggest you send the game back to Amazon.
Vliaa3QUaa	Personally, while both have their fun aspects, I LOVE playing a hunter (not nearly as much as my Warlock or Priest, but close!)    I like that the hunter has a pet that can be versitile to provide either DPS or tank as needed when soloing (and I know people with pets that have tanked in instances too).|`|FbcJq0ioaa	Paladin is the best class because the only other class that could defeat a paladin is a warrior and warriors don't do anything, but attack without using magic powers.|`|fAjW5rDjaa	I dont know.............|`|7XlKSsW1aa	it depends which you like better...paladins are like the class that can take damage, give damage and also heal... however hunters are like the long rangers.. i mean most hunters just send their pets in to fight for them.. personally i played a hunter, but i was one of the hunters that mainly used my short ranged weapons... like my swords.. but you would have to just try both and decide which one u like better

AA12397876	To repair enchanted items by yourself, you have to have at least level 50 Armorer (Journeyman level) and a repair hammer ( obviously)    To recharge enchanted items, you can either get someone to recharge it by paying them, each Mage's Guild hall in each city has at least 1 person that does this.     To do it yourself, you need a soul trap spell ( to cast the most basic one, you need at least level 25 Mysticism) and a soul gem ( which can range from Petty to Grand). Find a monster to kill, and before you kill them, cast the soul trap spell on them while you have a soul gem in your inventory, kill them before the spell ends and you'll capture their soul.    I recommend capturing Greater souls or Grand souls since they provide more "points" of energy. The points in this case might look something like this when you scroll over a weapon: "1240/1600". A Greater Soul will recharge 1200 points, and a Grand Soul will recharge 1600 of those points ( Petty recharges 150, Lesser recharges 300, and Common recharges 800)    If you want to know what monsters have greater souls or higher, there's a list here: http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Oblivion:Souls|`|a39ef54d237e89ba30c38f9973b82977aa	Repair enchanted weapons, or recharge enchantments?

0Umym3h9aa	They are both great consoles, it depends on which exclusives you like and what your needs are. Let me to do unbiased comparison between the two, since I have both consoles:    PS3  PROS  -Has blu ray so if you are into movies then it is a good addition  -Free online  -Resistance, Motor Storm, MGS  -Built in WiFi  -Not as many hardware problems as Xbox is known for  -No accessories to buy, everything is built in    CONS  -Blu ray movies are expensive but will get cheaper  -Online quality doesn't compare to Xbox Live. There is more lag  -There are not as many exclusives as the 360  -360 often gets exclusive content for games (GTA, Fallout, RES 5, Call of Duty all have exclusive DLC)  -360 is also licensed many former PS3 exclusives (Tekken, GTA, Res 5 games that previously came out only for PS2)  -No rumble for a long time (this has changed)    XBOX 360  PROS  -Great online quality, unmatched by Sony or Nintendo  -Many more exclusives  -Achievements for all games in history (achievements are more addicting then you think)  -Watch movies online  -Very cheap, only 199    CONS  -Too many hardware problems to list  -Online costs money, but it is a good deal  -No blu ray, which basically means no future in 5 years from now    I like both consoles equality. The PS3 is basically a media monster. It is HD ready, has WiFi, bluray and a good selection of games. However the Xbox is a cheaper alternative and is good for the people that just want to play games and don't care about movies or wifi.     The best thing about the xbox is that it doesn't come loaded with stuff that an average gamer won't need like blu ray wifi etc so they only need to buy the accessories that they need. In most cases they don't need to buy anything because everything comes in the box already. If you are into entertainment then the PS3 is more superior because not only can you play games but watch awesome movies and go on the internet.    It is basically about personal preference.|`|2b7mPq78aa	xbox 360 it can play dvds has more games then the ps3 it also has a live feature thats really good|`|raEUval8aa	PS3, because it has great games plus a bunch of extra awesome features.      Of course, this doesn't matter since you're only asking this question in an attempt to start argument.|`|iH07L6iDaa	they're both good in their own way xbox360 got great LIVE feature and really good shooters and PS3 has great graphics and can play PS2 games|`|XcvBcgiRaa	I say ps3 because you can watch blue ray disc, great graphics and its fun.|`|iAIv62HXaa	Simply put, it depends. I personally have tried them out and have come to this conclusion.    -XBOX360 has more games. In terms of online gameplay, it is equal. Xbox live is basically the same as PSN in my opinion-sure, there's a few extra features here and there but PSN makes up by putting their features. (PS3 Home)  -PS3 is a better all-around console. Some people might dispute on this, but PS3 features blu-ray DVD, music player, heat-sensor technology, and killer graphics. Basically, the cost of producing a ps3 is around $800. Sony has lost around 2 billion so far on the ps3, but they are hoping the games will even it out.  -XBOX360 appeals to the hardcore gamer. Definitely true. XBOX360 features much more games, including GoW2, Halo 3, and...well, they're there! Compared to ps3, ps3 only has 3 or 4 good exclusive games.    Breakdown:Your choice. If you're more of a hardcore gamer, go with 360. However, if you like to watch movies, occasionally play video games, and enjoy doing other things, get a ps3.    Hope I helped!
vtJDHJDYaa	Land in the First District to begin the next adventure right here in Traverse Town! There isn't anything new in the Item Shop yet, but purchase some Potions or Ethers if you are running low. Remember to sell any extra Arts items for quick cash. There isn't anything new in the Accessory Shop either, but buy some if you think you need to.    To the left of the Accessory Shop in the alley that you started in at the beginning of the game is a Red Trinity Mark. Use this to enter a closed off section of the Alleyway. The chest here contains DALMATIANS 4, 5, and 6. Return back to the First District.    Enter the Second District and fight the Heartless here. Once they are cleared out, head towards the Dalmatians' House and enter. If you've been collecting all the puppies so far, you should have 27 by now, which is enough to get you a FIRAGA-G. Head through the rest of the Dalmatians' House to reach the Alleyway.    Make waste of all of the enemies in the Alleyway, and then head over to the grate that the water is pouring through. You will notice that there is a Red Trinity Mark right by the gate. Use it to open up the door to the Secret Waterway. Swimming forward, you'll find Aerith and Leon. Keep talking to Leon until he suggests you see Cid. He will also hand over the EARTHSHINE GEM. We will use this in a second. Things will be easier if we return to Cid first. Before you go, check the stairs behind Leon and Aerith. There is a chest at the base containing DALMATIANS 10, 11, and 12. Exit the way you came in.    Back in the Alleyway, enter the Dalmatians' House to get another prize. This time it's a THUNDARA-G. Sweet. Exit back to the Second District and head back to the Accessory Shop. Cid will install your Navigation Gummi in exchange for a favor. He wants you to deliver an OLD BOOK to Merlin. You will suddenly hear the bell at the Gizmo Shop ring. Strange. First things first though. We have to deliver the book and complete Merlin's favor. Head back to Merlin's Study either by the Third District, or riding the platform at the top of the stairs in the Secret Waterway. If you opt to take the path through the Third District, you will encounter a new enemy.    Once you are in the Magician's Study, talk to Merlin. After the conversation, give the Fairy Godmother your Earthshine to gain the power to summon SIMBA. You can test out the summon by having Merlin bring you up to the training area. You may be curious about that book in the corner... well, we'll leave it alone for now.There isn't much you can do with it for now.    Head back to the Third District to find a familiar face. Once you are done chit-chatting, head up the stairs near the entrance to the Second District and enter the lit up house here. Inside the Small House, talk to Cid. After talking about stuff, he hands over a WARP-G, a very helpful Gummi indeed. You won't have to manually fly to worlds that you've been to before.    After the chat, head back to the Second District and enter the Gizmo Shop. After fighting off the enemies, exit through the other door and climb the ladder to the roof. Defeat the enemies here, and then use the Red Trinity Mark on the wall. Pull the rope inside three times to reveal the keyhole to Traverse Town. Sweet! Unfortunately, when you jump down, a familiar nemesis appears. It's Guard Armor again! Level 21 is a fair level to be at for this fight. Remember to equip as many abilities as possible, and to fill up everyone's item slots. Also, equip Cure on a shortcut button of your choice.    The battle starts out simple enough, but when you cause some damage, Guard Armor will suddenly transform into a different boss. Opposite Armor! After the fight, you will learn the AERO spell. Excellent. After sealing the keyhole, you will get another NAVI-G PIECE. Excellent again.    Return to the First District and talk to Cid for a COMET-G. He will also open up a Gummi shop, and if you want to buy something, buy a COM. LV2. This allows you use more Gummi Blocks in construction. If you enter the Accessory Shop now, there is a scene with Pinocchio. This isn't quite necessary, but it gives you some information on later events. If you were curious about the Old Book you gave to Merlin, you should go there now. Examine the book to enter a new world.|`|9sRUf4zEaa	I had the same problem before, I'm pretty sure what you need to do is go back to traverse town. I don't remember the details, but you fight a modified version of the suit of armor from before and you gain access to Aladdin's world and pinocchio's world, note that you get the transmission gummy from sid.|`|EUaIGX0Gaa	You have to go to Taversers town talk to Cid, he will update your gummyship then you will be able to go to Abgraba.

My advice is to trade it for something else in the store, or with ure friend.    people see money as stuff u can get stuff with so of course their not going to want to give it away, but if u trade it for store credits or something else, i can garuntee u that ure gonna get a way better deal|`|JvQ2Reb9aa	really dude??!!! gamer doc  is good|`|PxTLTTxSaa	gamestop or ebay

vmF0roqhaa	Congratulations on finishing the house....as for the trees you will need fine multiple strand electrical cable - preferably not connected to anything live.  Best option is to obtain the industrial variety, about 2 cm in diameter and best found where building demolitions/refurbishments  take place.  Get a length of wire and strip about 2/3 to 3/4 the length of insulation to reveal the fine strands.  The remaining insulation may remain as the main trunk.  If its too thin, just combine multiple wire lengths.  Unwind the strands separating them from the single wire twist   Rewind them into smaller wire twists to create the branches and sub-branches and bend to shape and appearance.  Remember to randomly branch out wires along the sub-branches to serve as barbs to capture your applied leaf material  Once you are satisfied with the shape and appearance , use pre-mixed builder's filler material to cover the wires.  Sculpt the material after it sets to replicate the bark and paint to suit  Apply your preferred precoloured  leaf material if required    Cheers from a 1/72nd scale tank and plane model nut|`|9o05qM2Saa	yea

Umbreon- have evee evolve during the night(must be traded from Gold or Silver versions)  Espeon-have evee evolve during the day(once again must be traded from past generations)  Onix-evolves when traded with metal coat  Electabuzz evolves in Diamond and Pearl when trade with electerizer  Trade the Kadabra and you get alakazam  Give Rhydon a protector and trade him(D and P only)    Your team would be destroyed by a Starmie-Surf, Ice Beam, Psychic and calm mind is a common moveset. Try putting in some ground or an Alakazam would be good. A Shuckle would greatly increase the overall of your team.    Cerulean Cave- Get the Ruby and Saphire stones  Idk where Iron Island is.

AUCcZ8lQaa	Firstly, a nerd would not have a wii...a nerds mom would...lol...j/k.    I would go with Rock Band 2 since you can get expansions for it (AC/DC, Track Packs) and it has 84 songs or so.|`|hQNdZ2flaa	Guitar Hero|`|eyirmbEKaa	hmm very tough both good games,  only thing about guitar hero is that the drums may be defective (not able to play) but still if you're not into the drums then the game is awesome!    rock band has loads of songs which you make you play forever and downloading so much more songs    personally i still have to go with guitar hero im a fan of GH and the songs are so great, even if you dont know the songs when you play them you'll love them guaranteed so guitar hero would be a good choice|`|hFihtxJwaa	Guitar Hero, because i'm not too familiar with RB|`|xMt0gktCaa	Guitar Hero
ieiAdMtBaa	Yeahh we will have to buy expansions.    Coz the original sims had a pets expansiona and so did sims 2.    So I think we'll be forced to shell out for pets AGAIN!|`|Dso7k3sjaa	You worded your question like you were asking whether people thought the sims 3 games were going to have ep's like the sims 2 games do, but then the way you phrased the rest of your question sounds like you are hoping people will say that everything that is in the ep's for the sims 2 will be in the base game of the sims 3.    EA has already stated that there will be expansion packs for the sims 3 and in fact, a team is already working on the first one while another team is finishing up the base game so it can be released for sale.    Plus, they have already said that in the base game there will not be rain, snow, thunder or lightning, but they plan on adding that later on.  Also, if you look at ALL the pictures taken in the game, there are no pets either.    I imagine they will probably make an ep that adds Pets, but you do realize that EA has taken several polls on their sims 2 website and that the Pets ep is always listed as being the one that people like the LEAST, so it's possible they may not add a pets ep this time around.  Pets also sold the worse of all the expansion packs, only some of the stuff packs sold less than the Pets expansion pack did.    Here is a link you can click on that offers quite a bit of information about the upcoming sims 3 game:    http://www.snootysims.com/thesims3index....|`|DBIeKv49aa	I am so excited for this game to come out! I know for sure that EA will have EPs and SPs, like someone else said, they want us to spend more money. With saying that, I'm sure Sims 3 will come with cars and such because it is so anticipated they don't want anyone to at all be dissapointed... word spreads fast. I'm hoping that the lifetime aspirations will continue, because it's a fun goal to complete. But I hope they somewhat relate it to their personality. I have a feeling this will be a big game, I hope my laptop can take it!|`|PxTLTTxSaa	I'm sure it will. After all, the base game can't possibly have all of the available features, so they will add more. Also, EA will want us to spend more money...

SkpRC2Nmaa	after you have finished certain levels, like level 3 in world 1, go up to the mushroom above the level 3 space and it will do something and might let you save.
ZflLpKQoaa	Depends on your range level, and how often you use range. I would not bother, as there is a lot of things you can do with 650k, but if you are a pure ranger and do nothing but, then you might want to get it.. I would personally save up for a crystal bow + it's repairs or something other. For a +4, I wouldn't bother (unless you only range and already have like all the good stuff, like ranger boots + robin hood hat + black d'hide + crystal bow, and even then I'd keep the money to help repair the bow)

AQ9JxT5xaa	Go here to buy free full music albums.  It's a forum and is completely free.  Just search for an artist and it'll give you results.  All of the files are in .rar format, so you will need to download Winrar to extract them.  Winrar is also a free program, so just search for it.  Oh yeah, Frostwire is technically better than Limewire since it's like Limewire PRO, but without glitches and all that bad stuff Limewire has.

One thing you can do, though, is get a subscription to the Zune Store, althought this will probably not go onto an iPod. You can use it on your computer though. It's only $15 a month. One problem is that you don't get usage rights; they expire after you stop updating your subscription. You do get to keep 10 songs a month though.|`|ecOfV8Blaa	pandora.com  playlist.com|`|ozM1rX7Iaa	Go to playlist.com and use DownloadHelper for Firefox to download it.|`|ad0eb1e8f993f37b5e550bf42f6ca748aa	Downloading any kind of music for free is usually illegal.|`|iAIv62HXaa	Umm...I guess you could download through torrent?

WdEuk62Xaa	No. It's like WoW, but except without the magic and everything. But tell you the truth; it really does suck.|`|HVKfuhp3aa	You can be all three. :D A gunner, a warrior, and a mage. In the beginning, you can only focus on being one, but eventually it's better to just level up with all three. You'll see. It's fun.  It doesn't have an extensive multiplayer thing, though. Only with your friends on Xbox LIVE if yo have LIVE. There is a lot to do. Completing the game took a few days for me, and there's still alot to do off the main storyline.|`|2b7mPq78aa	umm in a way but much more open to do things like u dont have to take turns attacking and wait to cast spells.|`|fkqPs9QRaa	yea there are like 8 spells or so u can upgrade, theirs swords, axes, pistols, heavy guns, etc.  Its a good game|`|3cQJhSqXaa	I'm pretty sure it's not.    WoW > Fable 2, but if you aren't into MMORPG's, Fable 2 isn't bad.|`|AosW4IvHaa	i hear it's is not very good|`|qHhtqoM1aa	Its not really like WoW and here are some reasons i find why.  1. The Mage option has only a limited amount of spells when WoW has many multiple spells.  2.The warriors on WoW and Fable are totally different. Warriors on Fable are more for just chop and slice. On WoW they are more for Tanking and taking large hits.  They are totally different things man and im sure alot of people agree with me.|`|a39ef54d237e89ba30c38f9973b82977aa	Yeah, you can use magic, arrows, swords, and guns.    Also, picture WoW with better graphics, a few more loading screens, and a more in-depth story. But, WoW has MMO, while Fable 2 has only 2 player co-op.

RKIt9zSIaa	OK - some of those    Kids doing their homework - they have to be in a good mood.  Make sure they are not over tired, not hungry and sufficiently entertained.  Then tell them to bloody do it.    Yes, always 20k - some people cheat money.  I don't.  I prefer poor sims.  In fact, I have hacks that make them poorer.    The little bubble means they are a. desparate (ordinary desires are in black) and b. need some entertainment - buy them a telly.    Tips - for a beginner, attend to their needs - make them eat, sleep and get comfortable, don't let them choose for themselves - and use the pause button a lot so you can cancel their own actions and force them to do what you want.  The player is usually far more efficient and intelligent (though that's debatable sometimes) than the sims themselves.  Sims are like computers - completely dumb.|`|5nvQ9SKlaa	You have to keep them happy by doing their aspiration goals and you must give them their needs such as hygiene, toilet, eating etc....If you dont take care of the children then they will get tooken away from you.  The kids do their homework only if you tell them to do (you must be playing the child in order to click on the homework so they could do it) the parent  can click on the homework to but thts only if you want that parent to help them with that homework...you must tell them to do the homework because if you dont they will fail and have a low grade and you dont want tht....They will always start off with 20k to buy the house     cheat   motherlode         50k    do you knw how to pull up the cheat window?  anyway just pull up the cheat box and type that into the box and you will have that amount plus the amount tht you had.  The bubble (with the tv) mean that they want to have fun. watching tv would do the job =)  have fun|`|Yi9iTmWNaa	If one of your family members died then there going to always cry and stuff about it.  If the kids don't want to do there homework its probably because they are not having enough fun or maybe there tired or something? You should fix there needs and make them do there homework 'cause they'll get sent to military school if they fail school.  Yup they always start off with 20k unless you use the familyfunds cheat.  The pink and white bubble that looks like a tv means they are not having fun. Have them watch tv or something for this to go away.|`|JBDZ0ubBaa	you have to keep a close watch on their happiness meters otherwise that get mad or sad. they ALWAYS start with 20k for money and when you see a pink and white bubble it means they want to watch Tv or play a video game or what ever the bubble says lol. Good Luck xD|`|YM6MrT8Xaa	You have to take care of them. Sad/mad could be low social or low overall stats, so make sure they eat, sleep, bathe, socialize, go to work, do something fun, and keep the house clean. Kids won't listen if they are in a bad mood so take care of their needs and they will obey. Every family starts with 20k to start their life, and if you marry someone from outside the house you get part of their money. Those are need bubbles and tell you they want fun because they are bored, sit them down to watch TV and they will get better. If your sims are too hungry for too long they starve to death, if you neglect the kids social services will take them away.    Start small with 2 adults and get used to working them on a schedule, and slowly add more things as you get more comfortable, such as having a kid and such.|`|zDf0S8REaa	There's a cheat for the computer to keep them happy all the time if your having a lot of trouble.  to get the cheat box, you press shift, control and C  the cheat is 'maxmotives' this makes everyone in your household happy.  Like the others said, you need to take care of them. When their 'needs' meeters are green, its okay. When their color fades then you should get them whatever they need. The TV symbol that comes up means their bored. If you don't have enough money to get them a TV or anything, you can use the cheat 'motherlode' or 'kaching'. Motherlode gives you WAAYYYYY more money though.  Have fun!  Heres the site if you have any other questions. or just read the manual that came with it.    www.sims2.com|`|rGAhqrU1aa	First off, your sims are probably always mad or sad because you're not taking care of their needs very well, the bars indicate how good they are regarding hunger, bladder etc. If their needs are in the red, you need to take care of them right away. the one sim probably died of hunger or a disease or something. with the kids, if you don't take care of them, feeding them and whatnot, the social worker will come and take them away. When the sims tell you they don't want to do something, it's because their needs are too low. Regardless of how many sims are in a family, the family always starts out with 20k unless you either cheat or move other people in with them. with the tv and video game bubble, that means they need fun, as in their fun need is too low, try having them play a video game on the computer or watch the tv, some of the more serious sims prefer reading a book to get their fun need to go up, depends on the sim. Hope I've helped out some, if you need any more help, just ask...also, try looking on google for sims 2 hints and tips, there's lots to be found there.|`|rOAwZq7raa	I had the exact same problem when I started playing lol.  The TV and Video games means that their  Fun level is low, and the frustrating part is that when something is too low, they NEVER want to do anything.  You should be able to see their wants and needs bars, and there is a big hourglass looking thing next to their needs, if its red, that's when they stop doing stuff. You need to keep it green at all times otherwise they wont do anything.    I recommend cheat codes, I've never played Sims without them, which is why I had so much trouble with my new family cuz I didn't use cheat codes.  They always start out with 20,000 Simoleons, but once you buy your house, you press crtl+shift+c to access a little menu, then type "motherlode" and hit enter.  This gives you 50,00 every time you do the cheat, so do it as many times as you want.  Another one thats a personal favorite, enables most every cheat.  You press ctrl+shift+c, then type (exactly as I type) "boolprop testingcheatsenabled true", then to manipulate their emotions, you can either shift+click on their mailbox and hit "Make all Happy", or save and go back to the neighborhood after you do the cheat, and then go back to the lot and you can click anywhere on a need bar and it goes up or down (I think that cheat is good for potty training toddlers, you just set them on the toilet and bring down their bladder level over and over :-P)    One last thing, whenever you complete a want, you get aspiration reward points, which you can spend to buy exclusive items which help A LOT.    Good Luck :-)|`|WwlOxqWqaa	here is another cheat ctrl shift and c 2 open cheat box has to be in neighboorhood screen type in boolprop testingcheatsenabled true and you can drag mood bars up change relationships to and put skills up! also if your having a baby bring up cheat box and type forcetwins and u get twins! also with boolprop cheat on if you hold down shift on an adult character go 2 spawn and tombstone of life and death when the tomb appears you can click on it and get ure sim pregnant wivout woohoo and get ure male sim pregnant 2! go on to the sims 2 website and you can download cool clothes hairstyles etc u have to sign up thow and register ure game hope i helped!

Almost exactly like you. My gt is(IsaacClaark)
PoxGpbfzaa	OK, I have done a few parachute jumps in my time (Truthfully!)  The way to make sure that the "Chute" falls down in a straight line is to have a hole in it at the Apex. Not too big though, you don't want it to plummet now do you!  If I were you, I would make it out of something light and very flexible like thin plastic or a fine material such as silk. Most parachutes are made from a silk like material.  If you lay a plastic disposable bag on the floor and cut approx the size needed for a start, Try and make it perfectly round and mark the centre. Measure and cut 12 pieces of a fairly thick cotton thread to exactly 14 inches.  Now equally divide the circle into 12 quadrants and tie the threads at equal distances around the edge of the canopy.  Cut a hole of approx .5cm radius in the centre of the canopy.  Now tie the 12 pieces of cotton thread to some sort of light basket type thing or harness for your jumper.  Everything in parachuting is s folded into the pack so it comes out easily so fold it all like a snake and secure with a light elastic band at each end.  Well there is the way I would go about it so give it a try, I hope you have fun with your project and it works well for you.  All the best with it!  ;-)  Garry|`|vPCxIqBuaa	Use a plastic shopping bag and make it as big as you can, cut it into a square and put a hole in the about 1-2 inches, this will get it to fall straight.
LKd9sTTDaa	Yeah you do. you build building that can help your economy or buildings that make military units. you build up your army and go out and fight. im not sure if its campaign based or if its just free play but its sorta like age of empires or star wars galactic battlegrounds if you wanna check it out on games already out. they are pretty fun so i cant wait till halo wars comes out.|`|3eQhA8nraa	halo wars is a real time stragey game. you don't do any shooting. the best way i can describe it is your a general, sending marines to their deaths while you eat tastey food back at base far far away from the battle.    pretty much imagine advance wars for the gba, but with amazingly better graphics
58f00eb827abff12eac8ed561f2ced1aaa	MAC cosmetics is a great brand, used by many makeup artists.

P0wMTzDFaa	well,all you have to do is just call them over/invite over until they agree.  or you can use another character (if you play more than one and live together) to ask that person to come over (since they get along).    Or throw a party.      You can also get him/her non angry with you and then invite them to your house then make tham hate you there,then kill them.    That's what I used to do(:|`|d5ug5W5kaa	haha funny. well, get them to like you so they want to like you. then when they come over, kill them. lol|`|LbbawO7naa	Throw a party.|`|CTlkMN3Faa	you can keep calling.. it might eventually say "I'll be right over" LMAO the sims is ma sh**!!|`|Mwb5UkPBaa	If they are friends with another sim in that household you can choose the Invite Household option.|`|5nvQ9SKlaa	If you throw a party it wouldnt work because they wouldn't come and if you call them repetively sooner or later they wouldnt answer or they will be a little annoyed so i have no clue wht you might do but i hope you find something out soon so you could kill off the person tht you hate|`|YM6MrT8Xaa	Just wait for them to come over on their own then kill them.|`|JBDZ0ubBaa	i think you have to become their friend first dont you? i would anyway, or atleast an acquaintance so they'll talk to you
012c00f3aed6127a6a10506a53fbc105aa	Ha. Well you pretty much said what I was going to. Personally, I like CoD 4 better because of the new/modern weapons, and the change of environment. CoD 5 has the same old WW2 weapons and environment.    The thing is, though, a lot of people are switching over from CoD 4 to CoD 5 and that means that less people are going to be online. So if you REALLY like the online, I suggest you get CoD 5.|`|OEQAGJZZaa	More people play cod 4 online than cod WaW, so get 4.  People will still be playing 4 until cod 5 (the next modern warfare) comes out.|`|OphA7zxSaa	i would buy cod4 because it is a lot more fun than modern warfare.  you can probably get it used for a decent price.|`|Bkdpkbhiaa	While both games are published under Activision they are not made by the same development team. Infinity Ward (COD4's developer) is generally labeled as the company that does the best job. COD5's developer, Treyarch is often labeled as a wanna-be. COD4 is hailed as having some of the best online-play ever created while COD5 has been labeled some of the worst. I, personally would tell you to get COD4 and anxiously await the sequel, but you should really rent them to form your own opinion.|`|33H19iQqaa	go for cod4 it is way more fun
ZDm00lmXaa	Both of the games are pretty much the same. One is based on Modern Warfare and one is based on World War 2. The online is the same for the two but im pretty sure COD5 has more people. There are different maps and different weapons. Since you do not own COD4 im pretty sure you wont mind getting COD5 since they are pretty similar. Now if you like certain weapons like newer ones go with 4 but if you like the old type of weapons go with 5. If you like large city type maps go with 4 and if you like spooky destroyed town maps go with 5. The choice is yours!|`|QRG2L5Qjaa	COD 4. COD 5 sucks, except for nazi zombies. I hear it from everyone that COD 5 is not good as COD4
qsp6tYaQaa	Sorry, but no option on Halo 3. But like others have said, there's not a lot of blood in it. (see first link below)    You should be able to in Gears of War 2 since you could in Gears of War (second link below). I will let you know, though, Gears of War 2 wasn't that great...in MY opinion. I'd more opt for Halo 3    Good luck|`|iH07L6iDaa	yes on the options menu|`|OEQAGJZZaa	No you can't in halo.  There isn't much blood in halo to begin with though.  You can in gears 2.|`|yHdK6qCHaa	you can on gears of war 2 just look around the settings it says Turn Gore off or something i forgot. idk about halo 3.  hope that helped :]|`|LKd9sTTDaa	im not sure but if you go to console settings on the dashboard  and go to family setting while the disk is in u might be able to do it from there

xNB4RJCxaa	usually the 48-hour code is only in new or limited edition games so if you just bought halo you probably wont have a 48-hour code but if you bought it within lets say a week you would get a code i just got gears of war 2 limited edition and i got the gold lancer code, a 48-hour code, and the 5 flashback maps.|`|BBXpXZp0aa	i dont think halo 3 comes with one....you can use the 1 month gold subscription or the silver membership...|`|kSKHpcqEaa	there is no such thing

6vIfTppraa	Call of duty by far is one of the best first shooters ever made. The online mode is breaktaking and graphics arnt that bad either. I would advise you to purchase Call of duty, as it will keep you entertained for hours on end, ecspecially the online mode :)|`|Lc9qSCn8aa	I have never played Resistance 2 since i only have a 360 but COD 4 is sweet the multiplayer is awesome on xbox live but u cant system link 8 players which is dumb.The single player is intense they have a sniper mission which is really cool. I would get COD 4|`|ATsjKkKoaa	call of duty is a good game but, resistance has a better online multiplayer, up to 60 people online in one sever and 8 player co-op|`|raEUval8aa	Resistance 2 is the better buy at the moment. You get a very good single player mode and an incredibly addictive multiplayer. The COD4 single player is also very good, but it's also very very short.    People are only saying it sucks because this section is infamous for being full of nothing but Xbox 60 fanboys.|`|AzeOk29saa	CoD4 has one of the best single-player modes ever, in my opinion.  It is also outstanding multiplayer, as hundreds of thousands of people still play it.  It takes a few games to get the hang of the Live games, but then it's freaking amazing !    Also, I'm really not a fan of Resistance.  I've only played it for a couple of hours, so I don't think I would be the best judge of the game.  But it's possible that I would get interested in it if I picked it back up. (sorry for bad answer there ...)    ... and I'm sorry that your parents don't like Amazon.  It is extremely reliable.    And to cap things off, buy CoD4, without a doubt !|`|kSKHpcqEaa	call of duty 4 is way better do no get resistance 2 it sucks|`|UShcJrF8aa	dude get the new call of duty  resistance sucks man  online is gay|`|yEzogpe9aa	cod4 but dont be a marty fag or be a noobtuber or use laststand.     shoti all the way
RVM7EzA0aa	There is a list of guilds on this website: http://guildtoad.com/guilds.aspx you could go to their sites and ask them if you can join. Just click on their guild name to bring up their website. Then click on "sign up" then "guild recruitment" and "recruitment application". I would look around on their website a bit first to see if you want to be part of their guild.|`|KfxTNNP5aa	good luck with that. You should have played horde anyway. What i found is that guildies are more interested in running high level quests and instances and raids than anything else. I just solo it most of the time unless I run into a group needing some help. Best thing to do is to make a couple of friends that are about the same level as you and try to play together as much as possible.|`|3cQJhSqXaa	1. If you are new; don't go on the forum, it's troll swamped. (I'm one of them >:D).    Tbh, if you are new, just ask in general/trade (trade is /2 then add a space, general is /1 then a space, you can only talk in trade in major cities, Stormwind, Exodar, Ironforge, Darnassus, Shattrath, and Dalaran) in your city, as you probably won't find any guildmasters on your specific server who will answer on your specific server.    Edit: Don't listen to faction favoritism; if you listen to the post below. Factions being better vary by server.    Edit again: Also; I agree with the post below about getting some friends to run things together, but there are truly helpful guilds that will run you through instances. Most low level guilds who want loyal members will allow people to get promoted if they run x number of lowbies through instances, so it works out like a system to get lower leveled characters to level quicker.    -Ibakecookies, Tichondrius.    My character info is in my signature; I know what I am talking about, highest level, 20,000 lifetime kills, 90 days played.    If you have any more questions, send e-mails to greenanole5894@yahoo.com and I'll answer any of them.|`|ejHhd5bMaa	hey well i have used some different guides for wow and i have found that Joana's guild is the best guide out in the market, if you want to take a look at it i found a video that you can see some one is using the guide to get to level 60 in 4 days check this out its cool   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcJuJJXBN...
ReU6sIUiaa	One option is the Security of Stronghold. You could try the level 27 minotaurs or go to level 2 for harder stuff.    Another option is Hill Giants in Edgeville dungeon. The only downside is that it can get busy.    Also try going deep into the Varrock Sewers and there is some good zombies, skeletons and deadly red spiders. You can try and take the deadly red spiders eggs which sell for 375 each at the Grand Exchange!|`|jcuh49u8aa	whats best is to go to the stronghold of security at the beginning of level 2, good monsters like levels 20's 30's and at the end there's 50's,trust me ,don't go lower!|`|xuIcsOXcaa	depends what your trian like i trian at lesser in lummby wizzy tower for my mage and range if you wanna trian str you can simply go to stronghold or gaurds in vereck|`|uAefMTNNaa	A good monster to fight would be level 27 Minotaurs in the 1st level of the stronghold of security. They give good drops (especially if you range with iron arrows, as they drop quite a bit of them) and there's lots of areas to get behind if you're getting low.|`|BCKFs6Fxaa	At your point.....    I would say go the Stronghold of Security and stay on the first and second level, (the gray rocky one, and the sandy one). This is an all around training area. You can train on wolves which have safe spots for range and mage, while you can melee kill some flesh eaters (if you think you are powerful enough) on the second level.     Also, you can try out the level-28 hill giants located just west of the Grand Exchange area. If you have a 'brass key' enter the cave through the small house by the River Lum (by Barbarian Village). There are some safe spots and that have fair drops. I used these mostly when I was your level.|`|nddM0DOYaa	try hill giants. if they are too easy, then move on to the hobgoblins next to the giants. u need a brass key to get to the hillies

Also, to install a game onto your hard drive takes about 7 GB.|`|LFDLpFq6aa	depends on if you download things like demos, i have a 120gb (downloaded a lot of demos) and now i have 60gb, a game will probably use maybe 70mb for a save|`|a39ef54d237e89ba30c38f9973b82977aa	It went REALLY fast for me. You may want to invest a little and buy the 60 GB hard drive.|`|jLv6gKxBaa	for game saves 20gig is more than enough even for downloaded maps and some other things here and there like arcade games (the limit on those set by microsoft is 200mb and most dont reach that high)  But if you are planning on installing a game to the hard drive (takes anywhere from 4-6gigs) u can see that the 20gigs are not all too mighty   a game save by the way is nuthing like the ridiculous ps3 ones and 1mb or less that 1/1000 of a gig some take far less.

AA11850311	If you are asking about where to get clothes like the sims have for yourself in real life, I can't really help you.  A bunch of H&M clothes were put in a Sims2 Stuff Pack, and sometimes people will make Abercrombie or Gap clothes, so I guess you could check those stores.  You can get some shirts with the Sims logo here http://ea.seenon.com/index.php?v=ea-thes...  Now if you want new clothes for the sims in your computer game, I can definitely help you there.  http://modthesims2.com  All content is free, and there are new items daily.  Everything there is scanned to be virus and hack free, unless of course it specifically states that it is a game hack or mod.  It is the only site I trust 100%  When you set up your account, you can have the site show you only items that are compatible with your configuration of expansion packs.  If you download and install the custom content correctly 99%+ of the items there will work.  The basics are as follows  Only get items that are compatible with your games.  If the item requires Pets, but you don't have Pets, don't get it!  It can seriously mess up your game at worst, or at best, just not show up in-game.  Custom Content must be placed in the correct folder    My Documents / EA Games / Sims2 / Downloads      Putting CC in your Program Files or on your desktop will not work.  Custom content must be extracted.  Putting .zip or .rar files in the Downloads folder will not work, you must un-compress those files.  Most files when uncompressed will be .package files, but sometimes they will be Sims2Pack files.  Sims2Pack files will have a round blue icon with a person or house in the middle.  These are most often complete sims, or lots.  You must double click on the blue icon to get those files to install.  Sometimes custom content requires a separate file called a mesh to be downloaded as well.  Creators should make a note of that, and provide a link.  (Custom content showing up as the same default clothing or hair style often means you did not get the required mesh)  The guide below has more complete instructions on installing custom content.  http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title...  Additionally, be extremely careful about getting anything from the Exchange on the official Sims2.ea.com website. The objects there are fine, as they are made by Maxis, but I would not trust any of the sims, and certainly not the houses. Anyone can upload anything and they are not checked for hacks. You could easily download something that you don't know about or want, and it could really mess with your game.|`|RKIt9zSIaa	You mean the electronic sprites from the game?  You get them with the game.  Ummmm - I'm not sure what you mean.|`|T8fiosWOaa	thesims2.ea.com|`|22oG4Rs0aa	I have a list, with links, of all my favorite sites for downloading custom content. You can find it in my blog at myspace.    www.myspace.com/paperbeth     You should NEVER have to pay for good custom content.    HAPPY SIMMING!
mH7LhUPGaa	You would be referring to those where you get them without buying/trading. They would be    a) a random event; it just happens, can't control it    b)playing keyquest, opening the vault using gold keys only    c)begging your friend/neofriend/anyone to give you one :)
SwKPJRNvaa	No. THe cartridges are different shapes|`|EjtuZHgNaa	no|`|XnsxMUvxaa	no unfortunately not. It would be like trying to play a tape in a cd player. However if you give up searching for super mario bros three and you have a Nintendo Wii and a internet connection than you can go to the wii shop and buy either one. If you don't have a Wii or can't find the original game than i'm sorry but your outta luck. Those are great games thogh.|`|t1wBZthoaa	No, sadly the SNES isn't backwards compatible. There was an SNES game called Super Mario All-Stars that had remakes of Mario 1,2,3 and Super Mario World all in one cartridge though. Mario 3 was also remade for the Gameboy Advance if you have that (Nintendo DS will play it too).     You can also search online for NES Emulators that will let you play NES games on your PC but they're considered to be illegal in the U.S. unless you own the original game. It's not a heavily enforced law, but it makes trying to find them tricky.

You need nightlife for a vamprire and apartment life for a witch. both you have to become best friends with them. 50 daily 50 lifetime.   The vamprire to bite you it will come up with some option when you talk to them for that. There are three ways to get your first vampire sim, although they basically   both involve the Grand Vampires that roam the community lots at nighttime downtown. There are two Grand Vampires at any given downtown, although it's also possible that there are two sets of them by default, either way, you have the Count and Countessa.  The Count wears a unique black "Dracula" like suit with a gold medallion while the Countessa wears a distinctive red long dress, and tends to wear the hair style that came with Nightlife with the jewel piece. You will also recognize them by their pale skin color, fangs, red eyes and the way they walk with their arm covering their face stalking the night.  The head witch or werelock is only appears on community lots and usually makes a grand entrance. You need to get a high enough score with them also to become a witch or werelock.   If you have any more questions go onto gamefaqs.com they really have some good advice and some help on how to do it without cheating.     Hope this helps.

HyD012nuaa	Well, you better thank me. You can go to some1 elses house in runescape that has a gilded altar. But first u gotta go to the runescape forums under COMMUNITY. Go to search threads and type : open gilded atlar. There should be some posts on what world the owner of the house is allowing ppl to use the gilded atlar in. The house portle is mostly located in yanille as there is a bank really close to it.    BEST ANSWER?
HyD012nuaa	Well, there are many different ways in runescape to make money. In my opinion there are about 2 good ways to make money in f2p (free to play). One of them is hill giants located in a hut southwest of the grand exchange you need a brass key and when u kill them they drop big bones. Worth 350 gp. The second and in my opinion better way is to tan cowhides. First you will need to sell all your items. After gathering all the money u can get go to grand exchange and buy cowhides make sure to have about 7k in cash as you will need some cash because the guy charges to tan. Go to alkharid where there is a bank. Near the palace there is this building with a shirt icon on the minimap. Go to him with your cash and untanned cowhides and click trade. Tan them to hard leather. You will make 50gp per cowhide. It may not seem alot but the guy tans the whole invo in 1 sec and you get about 5k for every 100 u tan. These in my opinion are the 2 best ways for f2p.     For mems however there are a whole ton of diff ways. First of all there is fletching. You can make a ton of cash off it when u get 70+ fletching im 99 fletching fyi and i made 3mill off it. Btw there are dragons i prefer green dragons. They are east of clanwars and there are a whole ton of them. Remember to bring an anti dragon shield. My opinion on an invo is to have 1 games neck (have a couple more in bank) 1 teletab and and full invo or less depending on your level. Each set is about 60k which is a ton of cash. Lv 70s can get a set in 20-30 min, 80s 15-25min, 90s 15-20mins (im lv 98) and 100+ can get in like 10 minutes. There are many different ways of making money in runescape these are just a few that i use. Hope this helps. Happy scaping.|`|6bqqNsiuaa	Ok, first thing: take a chill pill.

1L7VWFpTaa	is the file a .exe file? if it is, your going to need an image file. An image file is a file that tricks the computer into thinking that there is a cd inside. Some common image files include: .iso, or .cue. Keep in mind, there are a lot of other image file types. Once you have the image file, you need something that will act as a cd reader. I recommend Daemon tools. Once you have that, just attach the file, run the game and voila!    Make sure that the image is the same as the game your playing.|`|haapeymNaa	Download a cd crack for it and you're on your way.|`|jJqx6HQlaa	hhahaha. im the right person. if you want to download games. first of all make sure the game/movie/program download has at least 40 seeders. seeders make the download faster. but not enough time to explain that. and second you need a No Cd Crack. google diablo crack. and im sure there will be some downloads. when you download a crack. you move the crack to the file location of the game. then it will ask do you want to move and replace? click yes. then you dont need a cd. well.... this may not be the best answer ever but. if you have xfire add me my username is levi003227 i can really help you if you have xfire. download xfire at www.xfire.com|`|7SPakLqzaa	You need to download the crack and copy that to the game's folder in your c: drive.  How to:  Copy the crack (no-cd fix) file, go to your local disk (c:) drive, program files, the folder for the game, and paste to replace the other file that's already there. After that, you should be able to play the game.    I Googled some links...they might contain the crack:  http://www.demonoid.com/files/details/14...  http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.x...  http://rapidlibrary.com/index.php?q=diab...

YM6MrT8Xaa	I wrote a guide for EVE Online, and was approached by a guy wanting to buy it off me and sell it on eBay as a guide to get rich. I turned him down, but they are not discriminating about what they will publish as a get rich quick guide. There are lots of resources available for free for WoW regarding how to make gold, the only difference is this guy might have done some research and found a good way and tried to keep it a secret, but with the population of WoW there are no secrets, and everything in that book is available for free. If you do buy it, make a torrent of it and spread the word of it to destroy his scam, because that what it is, and probably plagiarized too.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	In all honesty, if you need a gold making guide, you're playing the game wrong.  It's incredibly easy to get money now.  Pick up herbalism and/or mining and/or skinning (check your server's economy) and sell everything you loot.  Do dailies.  Voila -- easy gold.|`|BLwtzGWcaa	I haven't looked at the site, but if it uses bots or something of that sort, you probbly shouldn't go that route. As for it sounding "way too good"...All of the gold making guides over dramatize the effectiveness of their product so they can reach a larger consumer base. Simple sales strategy. Most guides I have seen do work faster at getting you gold than the average person could rack up though...     I would just find a free version, waste of money buying if you have any common sense.    Sell the items your server needs and you can make a ton of money on the AH. Gathering skills FTW!
wMeqWUZoaa	why...you really wanna know ..okay...microsoft the evil xbox people pay **** loads of money to get certain games and they alsop ay to make sure that company does nto give there game or there dlc to sony...they litterally but developers and companies off just so they cna try and win and beat the ps3..and sadly...it seems to be working ...thanskfully though there some developers that see that the xbox systems is a piece of crap they choose not to develop there game on the xbox...all hail hideo kojima and metal gear solid 4 ..xbox keep buyign people off but hideo said " the xbox can not handle my game and i will not ruin it or make it worse, that it is by placing it on the xbox"..well there you go...thats why....|`|AUCcZ8lQaa	xbox gets it first because microsoft pays to get it first.

SaKNSKOnaa	You will have to search for a private server that matches your 'version'.  There are some that are TBC and some that are WOTLC, but the version of the game that the Server supports is up to the server managers, and will vary. Sometimes you will get a message that they are 'unable to verify game version' and this means that the version supported is different from the one on your computer.  Most private servers have detailed info on the version they support, so my best advice is to search for one that matches you or download a 'patch' for a server you want.|`|ncs6NLVZaa	no you will NOT find ANY... maybe 1 or 2 for TBC but most of em are WOTLK but non are classic wow...
t1wBZthoaa	According to Nintendo, there is no timeline. Every Zelda game supposedly takes place in a different universe with a different Link, Zelda, and Gannon. There IS however a fan-made timeline, but just keep in mind it's not official and Nintendo doesn't use it.    You can find the fan-made timeline here: http://www.zeldawiki.org/Zelda_Timeline|`|FdfE8iMEaa	I believe the first one was called Link.  The second was Legend of Zelda.  I'm not sure about all the other ones after that.  There are quite a few.  I really don't think there is any kind of time-line.  It is basically the same story over and over again.|`|whpBYCjPaa	you should check out zelda retrospective on youtube. it gives you a theory of what the people recording the video they think happened, and in what order each game is in their opinion. it talks about every zelda game to date besides twilight princess and phantom hourglass since it was recorded before those games were released.  apparently minishcap was first in the timeline, followed by orcarina of time, which split the story into 2 different timelines hence the 2 endings.|`|vOD4Urzdaa	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_...

qhNF5PmCaa	hmmm weird...    does she go to school on time?  does she do her homework?    and many questions. anyway maybe its borken. you can startover if you want.    or you can try to go in a private school, but if she already goes to a private school then, sory im not a expert, he-heh|`|Dso7k3sjaa	lol!!  Thumbs-up to the first answerer!  :-D    Seriously though, if you have aging turned off, then the grades will not go up.  You must turn the aging back on at least until your teen has the grade you want them to have.  Then you can turn it back off and as long as you have them do their homework and go to school, they will keep the grade.  ----------------------------  eta -- hmmm, the aging is turned on?  Most of the time when that happens, it's because the aging has been turned off.  You can't patch your game if you only have DD, because there isn't any patch for that game, so that won't work.    Do you have any cc?  If you do, try pulling the cc out and then playing for a while -- long enough to see if her grade will go up.  I would play for 3 or 4 sim days.    If you are on Vista, you can find the correct folders to drag to your desktop in this location:    Users\(Current User Account)\Documents\EA Games\The Sims 2\Downloads\     [Also, if you have ever downloaded a sim that comes with cc, then you probably have cc in the folder called Saved Sims -- but I doubt if that type of cc would make a difference anyway, so you can leave that folder in.]    If you are in XP, then look here to find the right folder:    Documents and Settings\(Current User Account)\My Documents\EA Games\The Sims 2\Downloads\     The location of the exact folder depends on your current user account, so make sure you're looking in the right place if you have several user accounts that show when you start your computer. You need to be using the one for the account you're logged into when you want to play the game.    There is also an EA Games\The Sims 2 folder under Program Files. But the Downloads folder isn't found in that location.     Basically, just drag the Downloads folder to your desktop.  Close everything back up and go in and play this sim.    If you find that it doesn't help -- or if you know you don't have any cc, then it might just be a glitched lot.  That happens sometimes for no apparent reason.  The only way to fix a glitched lot is to move the family into the sim bin, bulldoze the lot and then put them into a new house.    But, before you go to that extreme, there is one other thing that you could try as well:    http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title...    Good luck and I hope something will work for you.    **Just thought of one other thing you can try.  It might not be a glitched lot.  The actual sim might be glitched.  Turn the moveobjects cheat on and delete her.  Now save.  Exit to neighborhood, then enter the lot again.  She will be by the mailbox.  If she's glitched, that will fix her.|`|R7x0qIqyaa	Special ed?
lQGDV7MEaa	It depends on the look of the systems.  Gameboy Color looks like a solid brick and runs on batteries.  The gameboy advance looks sort of hexagonal, and has L and R buttons.  The Gameboy Advance SP folds up.    The big square cartridges are the Color cartridges which work on the Advance and SP, while the smaller, rectangular ones are specifically for the Advance series. There is no difference in the games that the Advance and the Advance SP can play.|`|oM7P6pMgaa	if they fit it is ok, i know from experience, gameboy color games fit into gameboy advance, but not vice versa    gameboy advance has smaller games and color has bigger games|`|d889ec36bb9adc89f3addb3dde100e23aa	If he has a gameboy advance, then there's no worries    all gameboy and gameboy advance games fit into the Gameboy advance    and all DS games have the "DS" logo on it.    So you can sell the Gameboy color if you wish    (Also, the Gameboy color games are larger, much larger, than gameboy advance games)

IBEl08szaa	If right when you opened the game and its broken or some thing is wrong with it you can return it in 30 days for a full refund or if you open it and you don't like it within 7 days you can get a full refund. Other then thay they price is going to be marked down.|`|JGPq1QJaaa	yes but u used so they wont give u a big refund|`|H0GVH863aa	I think they will replace it or give you a store credit.  It's up to the manager of that store to decide if you will get your money back.      Personally, I can't see how they can keep your money from you if they sold you something defective.|`|lQGDV7MEaa	They give you 7 days to return the product for an refund if it's used, and 30 days to exchange it for the same item if it's new or used.

5bM1eBQHaa	Do NOT overclock your processor, like the above poster said. Likely you will void your manufacturers warranty and even possibly toast your CPU. Not cool. Not to mention the fact that overclocking your processor on a laptop is more than a little bit hard. :)  Oh, and Mr. Overclock, that CPU you linked won't swing it for a Laptop.    You can expect to have some performance issues with Sims 3, when it's out, but as another poster noted, a dual core processor has more "bang" than a single core.. You can expect it to work, but be sluggish. Regarding the video card, you do have a video card, and it's likely a 3d one, but not likely to be a good one. Well, unless you somehow got lucky and the default card on your laptop is solid..    There should be some sort of spec which refers to the "integrated graphics" or the chipset, or something. Hopefully it's an ATI or a Nvidia 3d chip.|`|7Grez2cmaa	That .4 difference could mean alot you should swap out that processor or overclock it.  If you try to play sims 3 with that 2.0 it will be a bit slow. So overclock it or buy a new one becaus when they say the specks they recomend the slowest processor you could use so you could just use it so i reconmend a 2.5 or 2.66 if your a hard core sims player. If you over clock  use better cooling.    i reconmend this one but you could browse around for others.    this is just if your like making big families since its a dual core it should be fine for small families for 4 with a medium size house.    When i first sent this post you didn't say you were using a laptop that is important info i didn't see.      with the rude coment that the guy below sent to me.....|`|JeW2YOQSaa	The 2.4 GHz requirement is for a single core P4. Your computer is running a dual core, so it should be ok, especially if you have a video card. If you do not have a video card, you should still be able to play (on lower settings) as long as you have a good 2 gb of memory.    Edit: If you have a laptop, it is unlikely you have a video card, so it will be rough running Sims 3. However, you should NOT overclock your processor, as it will likely melt the inside of your computer. Laptops are not meant to be overclocked, and doing so has a high chance of causing severe damage. You can try it out, but you will probably have to play on all of the lowest settings if it will work.    Check this website out, as it is very helpful.  http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/ref...

LnYr2dLfaa	The Animal Crossing games are a lot like the Pokemon games. Same basic idea but with each generation you get a new region and new Pokemon to collect. Animal Crossing isn't too old and could still easily see another 3 or 4 games before it starts to slide - so their next game could be what we have all been waiting for.

The thing I did was shut off my computer and give it a rest for a few minutres and then start it up again. But then again, I left my computers for like 1000 weeks. LOL. So try restarting your comp. :]|`|sWKGUPziaa	For most laptops it's because the game is running in the background on your computer. There are all these programs that run at start up, making the game run in the background. The only program you need to have running at start up is the security system. So try this: Click on Run (If you don't see it in your Start menu, look in Start/All Programs/Accessories. Run is in there.) Click on run. Type in msconfig then click on the start up tab. There will be a whole list of programs checked off (enabled). The security program may be first on the list, if it isn't just look for it. That one has to STAY with a check mark next to it (leave it checked off/ enabled) and the rest of the programs can be disabled by UNchecking them. When you are done hit Apply. Then you will have to restart your computer for the disabled programs to actually be disabled. Just make sure that your security system is checked off and runs at start up, that's all. It's really important. Now your Sims 2 games shouldn't crash anymore because you have ended all background tasks. I went to Radio Shack because on this laptop I installed the Sims 2 and it crashed, too. So they did the disabling programs at start up for me. Then I did the same to my husband's new Compaq. The Sims 2 ran SO great on there! I hope this helps you with your game!! :)

My kids went there when they were 4 and 8 and they both hated it.  In our opinion the best park in the Orlando area is by far Universal Studios.  We make 6 to 8 trips a year to the area (my parents live 45 minutes from Orlando) and we all have season passes even though we live in Ohio. They have many rides that are based on movies and also during the feb through april months they have mardi gras where many popular bands are featured. Last year we were able to see Kid Rock, Eddie Money, Huey Lewis and a few others.  Enjoy!|`|WfqJK9cDaa	It is one of the best parks in the world. It is divided into 4 main parks.   1) Magic Kingdom: Amazing park, this is where all the fairy tale and adventure rides are. It is the best park in disney world.     2) Epcot: Very nice park, it is science related. It also has a 'pavillion' representing major countries in the world which are very fun to visit.     3) MGM Studios: The second best park there. It is a very techno park. So you'll find a mix of really cool rides and shows. DO NOT miss the show at this park, it is famous worldwide. Its called mickey's philhar magic.     4)Animal Kingdom: Name gives it away. Very nature related. Most rides are animal related. Good park again. Many wet rides.     In addition to the ones above, there are many water parks and additional recreational facilities, but those aren't the main attractions. If i were you, I would buy a 4 day pass and cover those parks above.   Trust me, once you go to those parks, you will never forget them. I went there when I was 9, still remember each and every moment, (I'm 17 now).|`|02e30ULXaa	the answer to your question is yes it is the best theme park in the world to visit.|`|9NpXU7D2aa	in my opinion YES!!!

O9FkZL7Oaa	That's a pretty good team. Depending on what level they are changes where to train. You should train where the wild Pokemon's level is closest to the average level of your team. That's what I do.    Since you didn't say what game it was, even though I know it's Diamond, I'll just tell you my teams in each game. Pokemon Leafgreen, Pokemon Emerald, and Pokemon Diamond.    Pokemon Leafgreen:    Charizard, Pidgeot, Poliwrath, Alakazam, Primeape, and Raichu.    Pokemon Emerald:    Typhlosion, Swampert, Breloom, Manectric, Swellow, and Salamence    Pokemon Diamond:    Empoleon, Staraptor, Leafeon, Lucario, Ampharos, and Metagross    These are my teams and I think you should evolve Marshtomp and your type choices are pretty good. If you think any of my Pokemon choices are good, then you can replace yours with some of mine.|`|oOGxok8vaa	To start things off, I AM A COMPLETE water type freak...not only do they look good, but they have a great type coverage only weak to grass and electric, but a real pain is water vs. water.    So I would add maybe...a...    Mitotic *yeah it is HARD to find...REALLY HARD...but so worth it* It is so versatile, it can attack and defend and can last really long. IF you are afraid of status, it is perfectly fine, it plays to Milotic's ability, Marvel Scale. I would suggest:  -rest   -sleep talk  -ice beam  -surf    If you do not have a milotic, then you can get a Vaporeon. While not as defense oriented, it has a higher special attack which allows it to kill more...I would suggest:  -surf  -wish *you need to breed*/ toxic  -ice beam  -protect    LOL, OTHER than water pokemon, Gallade is a great attacker, physical. However, it is not as fast as others, but it does have a HUGE attack. Instead of taking a regular straight forward approach, you can actually use his mediocre defenses and his great move pool to your advantage:  -Hypnosis   -Will-O-Wisp / Thunder Wave   -Close Combat / Brick Break  -Psycho Cut      Marshtomp can be evolved to a Swampert, as you may already have...and you can turn it into a WATER TYPE TANKING GOD, yet also sweep.  -earthquake  -avalanche *to use it rather horrible speed to its advantage and to scare away the grass types*  -curse  -waterfall    Scizor is highly reccommended. REALLY reccommended. Only a 4x weakness to fire and the rest is neutral or .5 dmg to you. And make sure it has Technician. It improves WEAK attacks BY A LOT, they double in power.  -Bullet Punch *bascially an extreme speed*  -Quick Attack *type coverage*  -Swords dance  -Roost    So far so good, you chose great pokemon. However, Flygon is a bit ONLY A BIT inferior to Garchomp. But it still works as it has immunity to the ever present earthquake. Good luck with your teams. IF you need anyonw to test out your teams email me and I'll give you my friend code.

KY50cbYMaa	You have to have the Sims Stories games.  They're made for laptops.  Sims 2 doesn't work on laptops or older computers, I've tried it.|`|ye6Buzneaa	sims 2 with expansions takes up so much space, you didnt even know. Probably ran out of room on your Hard drive.|`|9MO6Iu1laa	Idk but you can always take the game back because it could just be that certain game that isn't workg. Blow in the cd holder and rub scratches off. Sry not good with games but I do love sims lol|`|kDp3nuVdaa	It's not your hard drive, maybe your disk, but my suggestion is that your RAM is poor
BrVPlsdsaa	If you have killed a civilian, accept the "community service". Pause and go to 'Quests/Maps'  Then 'Regions' . Select 'Bowerstone Market'.    If the response is, "The bridge to Bowerstone is out, someone in Oakville might be able to help." , Then complete the quest ' A Bridge Too Far'

That game gives you:    The Sims 2  The Sims 2 Nightlife  The Sims 2 Apartment Life  The Sims 2 Celebrations    So, you are actually getting 4 games for right around $40.00.  I found it on line, but I also saw it in the store.|`|CkJKoTQ6aa	im not sure about this but if you realy could get it to work then i woulkd sugest buying the expansions, they have a massive sale on at kmart at the moment and if this answer doesnt help then im sorry for wasting yoiur time reading this answer
AA11850311	No, it will not.  You have the absolute minimum amount of memory, your processor is too slow, you should have at least a 2.6 GHz Pentium D CPU, or 1.8 GHz Core 2 Duo.  Plus, looking at Dell's website, the Inspiron 1525's seems to have Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X3100, instead of dedicated graphics cards.  That chipset just does not run any Sims2 games well consistently, I wouldn't even try to play Sims3 with it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://thesims3.ea.com/view/pages/newsItem.jsp?item=236875146" rel="nofollow">http://thesims3.ea.com/view/pages/newsIt...</a>|`|dc22b47d9c2cfb1a9c5c3086859fc998aa	yea it should just check on the box or CD and look for if it says if its compatible with windows vista.

Dso7k3sjaa	Okay, I just went and read your other question.  Dee has the correct answer.  If everything was working until you downloaded more houses, that means that one or more of the items in the new houses overwrote the items that the texture was based on.<br>  <br>  To fix it, you are going to have to follow this guide.  I know it's a long, tedious process, but besides simply deleting everything and starting over, it's really the only way.  (Or, downloading Delphys' Download Organizer and having it look for "orphan" files as Dee suggested -- which can be quite confusing to a LOT of people, myself included.)  Anyway, try to do what this guide suggests and hopefully it will help you:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title=Game_Help:Finding_Problem_Custom_Content" rel="nofollow">http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title...</a>

They're a low level, and rarely hit more than 1. You'll need food, but it'll just mean you're able to stay there a little while longer.    The only downside to this is that it can get quite busy at times. If there are 3 people, the XP rate is almost half. I would still advise you to check it out, since it'll be easier than say, Hobgoblins.|`|JRb7Ej2Kaa	lol go up in the wilderness and find those things|`|MejN4E8waa	try hobgoblin, which located near hill giants...  bring some food there, too, but not too much, becoz there are plenty of limpwurt root there.|`|dciibBF0aa	I dont play runescape anymore, but I can suggest lesser demons.

xIyt4usUaa	Actually if you want to get different types of fruit there is something easy you can do without needing to go to someone's town. Just write a letter to any animal in your town. On the first line of the letter say: Hello there friend. Then attach one of the seashells you find on your beach. When you get a letter back it will either have fruit or clothes. So send a few letters and you should get different types of fruit. I got all the fruits i didn't have this way.    Best of luck!|`|X6WAOqZOaa	send the town fruit to your animal neighbors, sometimes you get fruit sometimes you don't.|`|EoKa8wLmaa	i sent 100 bells in the post to each villager and got 3 different fruits try that|`|I7f5aAlIaa	There's an easier way to do this! It doesn't involve going to peoples towns either. This is what I do and it works:  1. Send a letter to one of your neighbors.  2. Write"Hello there friend" on the first line  3. Attach a seashell onto the letter  4. Go to the town hall; second window and send it  5. Wait a few days  6. Your neighbor will reply back with either an exoctic fruit  or a t-shirt.  Hope this helps! I already got Peaches :D    P.S. If you get coconuts, than plant them on the shoreline and water them 4 times a day. If not watered, they will just disappear.

Its the easiest way! Also eat a crap load of tofu. This will not effect your evil status. (Also becoming pure and evil makes you look incredibly young.) But you have to buy a good amount of buildings. If you just buy like one or two it will take forever to get pure. Just buy all of Bowerstone... or buy all of Albion.

XeykMTmCaa	Your copy of Ruby is most likely fake. The Gamecube games and DS games will both clear the data if a fake GBA Pokemon game tries to connect with them, if memory serves.  They show up all over the place, though most people that end up with a counterfeit seem to get them from eBay. If yours isn't a real copy, I don't believe there's any way to get it to work.    There's a guide on identifying them here: http://reviews.ebay.com.au/FAKE-POKEMON-...    edit: It's still possible to get them elsewhere, though if it was new and in its box, it seems unlikely that it wouldn't be real.  This is just my guess based on a fairly good number of similar topics I've seen - every single one of those ended up being due to counterfeit GBA games.  *shrug*|`|M4L3QY3gaa	Hate to say it, but maybe your Ruby is broken. Keep trying though, maybe it's rejecting one of the pokemon you're migrating. Are they all hacked?

7aTCBoN1aa	My 80 Warlock has over 12k.  I've seen Warriors with over 17k, it all comes down to your class, gear and spec.

My Rogue was only at 7K when he hit 70, but he was decked out in simple greens, nothing particularly powerful.    I would almost think you would be average, but I don't know how things would work on your server|`|fc740c7001eadcc9dc738c63e536abdcaa	its their equipment and the stats that they have.. it all can add way up. i used to have 13k on my 70 prot warrior. oh yeah, and the skill tree thing ( i forget what its called) matters too, that can have some stuff you learn that might boost the hp on your guy.. and btw hunters shouldnt have hp over 10k.. thats like a sin against nature my man...

PRaEOK9Maa	Judging by the way your question is worded, I think you're asking how do the special infected become what they are. The game doesn't say but I know in the commentary they talked about how they wanted to limit cut scenes so that players could dive right into the action. So they don't explain a lot in  the game, but there's suppose to be updates and stuff coming out in February so maybe there will be more cut scenes and explaining.|`|r60WMB6paa	its random select you cant choose so you are what you respawn as no changing it.|`|7aTCBoN1aa	It is a random selection.  Generally the game will try to make sure that there is some variety on the team though, if every special infected was a hunter that would make it pretty easy to knock everyone down.
Vz2Fzf1gaa	I know what you're talking about i pretty much did the same thing as you.  After researching, i found that you CANT play nazi zombies with a system link or with 4 players.

sJeR0kzUaa	I believe that the dark Aeons are only in the imported version of FFX. If you don't have that one then you don't get to fight them.    Darkmatter is something else. You can collect it to upgrade/add abilities to your weapons.  You can get it in a couple places. You will automatically receive 99 Dark Matters at the Monster Arena after capturing five of every monster in the game, although you can also obtain the item as a rare drop from pretty much every Area Conquest, Species Conquest, and Original Creation at the Arena as well.     You can also Bribe them from Land Worms from Bikanel Island. ( I think the minimum bribe for it is 1,200,000 gil, you can get anywhere from 1 to 4 dark matters when you bribe it)|`|ws1eDoKPaa	um i think the dark matter aeons are in final fantasy x-2...  *spoiler* they became dark because you have to kill them in the end of X
AA11159139	What works for me is the following series of cheats:  First, type in "BoolProp testingCheatsEnabled true" in the neighborhood screen. This'll allow you to do a host of other cheats, including the twins cheat.     Second, once you're in a family screen, SHIFT-Click on any Sim, and then "Spawn", and "Tombstone of L&D".... this'll allow you to speed up the Sim pregnancy so it's over in a matter of hours instead of Sim days, and if you have a same sex couple or want to get a Sim adult alien pregnant, it'll do those things too.     Third, do a successful Whoo-Hoo-- the lullaby will play. Then wait a few Sim hours-- about four-- and click the Tombstone of L&D with the pregnant Sim. Click "More" until you come to the screen that says "Speed Up My Pregnancy".    Fourth, once your Sim is "showing" in the pregnancy, SHIFT-Click them, and click "More" once. There should be an option that says "DEBUG-- Force Twins". Click it. When your Sim gives birth, it should be to twins-- usually a mixed set of boy and girl, but sometimes two of either gender.     Another cheat to get twins is, "BoolProp forcetwins 100", which works about 25% of the time with me-- more so if the other BoolProp cheat is used first. The one I detailed above works nearly all of the time.|`|Dso7k3sjaa	Just type in forcetwins.  But you have to type it in after your sim is pregnant.|`|8eRMjkcJaa	To use the cheat "forcetwins" you need Open For Business because when you get that game, your sims will be able to make cheesecake which automatically gives you twins when your sims eat it while pregnant. If you don't have Open for Business then you get twins purely by chance.|`|CkJKoTQ6aa	that first answer is wrong    you can have twins on the first sims 2 because i do it all the time, you dont need double deluxe to do it|`|qNYzCKaZaa	hey, before my sim gives birth i open up the cheat window and typed in ....    forcetwins    this has always worked for me.|`|AKYplVnFaa	i use forcetwins...  always work|`|yNavvSV4aa	type in boolprop testingcheatsenabled true and the press shift and click on the si you're playing as and hit spawn there should be a tombstone of L and R click on it you will have a tombstone then when you're pregnant click on it and hit force twins.

YEooEeKGaa	poker is a game of deception. To win you need to be able to hide the strength of your cards. One part of this is controlling your face, so not reveal how strong or weak you are.     normally, when people say poker face, they mean the person doesn't show his/her emotions or intentions. Usually like a stone face kinda person.     There is also the more cunning poker face which isn't a stone face but is deceptive anyway. So smiling and looking happy when your are sad or opposite.     Its all about being able to hide your emotions and showing what you want.     so in the song, its not really about poker. Its about being a woman and having to outplay her love and being able to hide her emotions from him.. umm but not being a woman there might also be more to it?? not sure :P     um hope that helps :)|`|IooE3cbBaa	Yeah i've seen the video, got the album. Its a good song.  Basically, a poker face is when players don't give anything away with facial expressions of body language.   For example, somebody that can't help grinning ear to ear when they get pocket aces is said to have a bad poker face.  So her talking about not being able to read her poker face is just taking about how she doesn't give anything away to the the guy she is singing about. Because its not really about poker|`|Bu4FP23paa	It's Poke her face. with an object. duh! everyone knows that

n3Rysktjaa	Uhm... well I don't think you can. The only way I know is to let one of your Sims beg to let the dead Sim come back. hehehe, sorry but thats the only way I know.|`|Dso7k3sjaa	Sort of.  Do you have both the University ep and the Nightlife ep installed?  Because if you do, you can go into the lot where the sim died and then type:    unlockCareerRewards and then your sim can get the phone to call the grim reaper and "buy" the dead sim back.  But pay the max cause if you pay less than 1/2, the sim will come back as a zombie.    If you don't have University though, then there isn't any cheat that will do that as far as I know, sorry.  :-(

uxeWIEPFaa	It's probably a glitch. I remember with my sims 2 seasons game whenever it snowed the ground would turn red and start blinking. My solution: I uninstalled it and re-installed it. Now it works without the gay blinking (:   Sometimes my sims start shaking because of a global mod I have that causes teen's to woohoo, so if you have any custom content that might be another reason.  :( It wont let my vampire sims bite anyone anymore without the influence thing D:|`|29919868a8e6aec825468b4dfa20f46aaa	I think after every 1min and 12 seconds they need to do something else. Say dance for 1min 12 seconds. then jump into the jaccuzzi, then bring dinner and stuffs like that after every 1min 20secs.. I think thats the best way to get it work. Hope this helps.
0ULBrjDraa	A ralts by itself can't learn cut (hm 01) or any other hm.  but once it evolves, a kirlia cant even learn any hm! same with gardevoir.  even if you evolve a male kirlia with a dawn stone to get a gallade, it still cant learn it, as well as any other hm.  if you are in desperate need of a pokemon that can learn cut, just catch a bidoof, they can|`|h9zzljmRaa	Unfortunately, Ralts cannot learn Cut.  It is because Ralts is not compatible with the move Cut.  However, if you have a male Ralts and you evolve it into a Kirlia, and then use a Dawn Stone on it, you can evolve it into a Gallade, who I believe can learn Cut.    Hope this helps :)|`|9or2yIqWaa	nope , sorry|`|hAtWolLraa	Nope unfortunately it can not learn cut|`|rM23CtI6aa	no it cant learn cut but if u stack up his talents right he can learn shadowburn and if hes hunter make sure you have aspect of the hawk on it increases range attack power by 90 this of course is the rank 5.

Z2EzfQFvaa	Use torterras attacks on cyrus's Pokemon.|`|pS8HhQkdaa	The best way is to teach it allot of grass type moves, because cyrus may have pokemon with the ability hover, wich means it is not affected by ground type moves. Also I suggest catching other pokemon, you can find some rare ones at the trophy garden, south of hearthome city. They have pikachu. pichu, roselia, staravia, krinketune, and many more! Good luck!

QEIgLRX4aa	Black dye is probably the most valuable common item in Pre.  There are definitely rare weapons and runes that are worth much more and of course any rare minipet is worth some cash.<br>  <br>  Charr bags and salvage kits do exist, but they aren't as valuable as the dye.  Bags sell for about 700g each and I think the salvage kits run around 1k per use.  They are recent additions to Pre and can be found as green drops from the Charr bosses north of the wall.   I think their rarity is about the same as most green weapons.<br>  <br>  Beer and other event items are also a good sellers for those folks that are working on the drunkard/sweet tooth/party animal titles in pre.<br>  <br>  I can't help with specific prices for the high-end items, but you might want to check out presearing.com.

AA12044495	It is like the same thing as the first Sims 2 for ps2.  You get to create 6 family members.  You could go to the Town Square and shop, socialize, and much more.  The areas to live are pretty great!  You could go up to a mountain, go to the farm, a place by the lake, in the woods, or on a island.  It is anyways really easy to get abducted!  You could also look for the UFOs flying at 12:00 AM - 3:00 AM at some direction.  New foods.  All recipes unlocked when started!  New family aspiration.  Inventory.  Pets decor!  Collars, and clothes.  Create a cool pet with unusual marks and cool clothes!  Teach your pets over 7 tricks!  Throw a huge party with sims and PETS then see a disaster!  Pets could get bad.  Enjoy!  CHEATS  Pet Points = T O X S L1 R1  Pet Emporium = R D R U R D R U  Gnome (FIRST) = L1 L1 R1 X X U  Advance 6 Hours = L D R R1 U L D R R1  Mine should be the best because I spent some time on this!:-)
