20090222152712AAZIkgL	Local Businesses;United States;Austin	Are there any Hippy/Bohemian apartment complexes in Austin?	Looking over craigslist, I see all these very corporate looking places that don't really match the vibe that Austin is famous for.  We'd like to find a reasonably-priced apartment situation that is hippy/Bohemian-friendly, if there is such an animal, maybe with a balcony facing a greenbelt or other wooded setting.  78704 near Zilker Park in a walkable hood is ideal, but we're open to other suggestions, as long as they're in a walkable area.  Are there agencies that cater more toward this community? Thanks, all you Austinites!!
