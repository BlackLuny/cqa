PdyT5mpOaa	team jacob.   she kinda bugs me sometimes   hes protective  hes hott!!!!!! he really loves bella|`|EeCpyde2aa	TEAM EDWARD  I don't care about Bella. :P But I still want her to be with Edward.  I love everything about Edward. His smile, his gesture, his unconditional love for Bella, EVERYTHING.  I guess Jacob's humor. :P|`|J2glFOkhaa	read the book yesterday    I dig Edward     I hate bella    He's a vampire, enough said    I don't know anything about Jacob    ps. the book really dragged on and on, ugh|`|FKzFx3mDaa	I am team Edward for the books, but team Jacob for the movies, if that makes sense.    I like Bella, but she can be a tad too serious and pessimistic.    I love how Edward cares about people and trys to follow his heart.    I like how Jacob is so sincere. He is te best kind of friend to have.     That is my opinion.|`|xF9JCIZnaa	Team Edward ofcourse.  Yes.  Looks, LOL! Joking I dunno.  He makes the stories more interesting.|`|tH8gGgH6aa	jacob.(:      i hate bella.  with a passion.|`|RP5NnxgUaa	I think the whole team thing needs to be cleared up because it's confusing. I like both Edward and Jacob, but Edward is better for Bella. I like Bella. I don't like Kristen Stewart though. My favorite thing about Edward is his traditionalness. I'm very traditional and I want that in a guy. My favorite thing about Jacob is that he is literally hot. I get cold a lot! I'm always cold. I'm wearing a long sleeve shirt and a sweat shirt and I'm cold, while my mom is in the same room in a short sleeve shirt and she is fine. Jacob would help me with my coldness! :)  Jacob's not a vampire. What are you talking about??

HSSuKNCUaa	My Aries took saying "I love you" very seriously, and so did I so it took a while but we both meant it.     "How do you act when you truly love a girl?"  He says - you do everything you need to, to be with her as much as possible and make her happy. It's not so much a change in behaviour but rather just a feeling taking over (awww). That's what he says.    "What are you really looking for when it comes to long-lasting love?"  He says - It's not something you look for, but at some point the time is just right when you have calmed down a bit, and you walk into a woman who can make you want to settle down without feeling tied down. It's a matter of understanding and passion combined.|`|pkWX3rbPaa	i highly doubt ALL aries guys want the same girl. i know a girl who has the same birthday as me and we couldnt be more different.|`|bxqwIjyeaa	what do aries want in girls? big boobs, butt and nice face|`|LRY2Ho5Zaa	Here's a tip if you are looking for love,    horoscopes are crap|`|a34be47c13310cd46726695b6458b81aaa	Wanna Date ?

5L5GQYFXaa	first of all a song doesn't come in so easily you cant sit down and say im going to write a song. My inspiration comes when im either in the bath or in the shower. secondly you have to write on emotions you fell these songs will make a greater impact.once you know what you ll be writing on you want to revise every single lyrics your write to be sure you are content with it.After nake others close to you read it for constructive opinions you might want to post it for more opnion thats what i did.|`|7jp7sTdFaa	Just a tip: make the lyrics ambiguous. The subject honestly needn't relate that much to the song, you just have to tie it in somewhere. Listen to a Bob Dylan song; the lyrics aren't directly saying what they mean, but if you examine them closer, it all comes together. So don't write literally; make the lyrics slightly vague, slightly ambiguous, and, all in all, passionate. If you have a guitar or piano, its probably best to start out finding the tune, then writing the song based on the emotion of that tune.

sTzHitDPaa	Both were really good movies, but the Uninvited wasn't as scary as the Unborn, so if you're not that experienced in the jumpy scary movies, I would go with the Uninvited. Be prepared to be confused though.|`|dR0M50mWaa	The Unborn is not fine  See My bloody valentine 3D|`|zetxxZWUaa	I think your talking about the movie The Unborn because there is no movie out right now that is called The Undead. If your talking about the Unborn then yes you should totally go see it because it's scary. It's like a mixture between The Exorcist and The Omen. The Uninvited wasn't scary at all, it actually sucked big time and it was totally confusing at the end. I wouldn't bother with the uninvited if i were you.

It's the same way for me, but I also have Sagittarius in three other planets in my natal chart so I have quite a lot of Sagittarius influence going on in me.

Gv606uKbaa	i would say that you should work on your tone because to me it seems a little nasaly . Try singing more with your throat. But dont hurt yourself by trying to sing notes too high for you. I like how you added a nice vibrato to the ends of some lines it made it unique
fJt5zRTXaa	Death Notes all have rules written on the Note's first page. The rules were written in English because this was the most popular human language. The basic rules are as follows:        * The human whose name is written in this note shall die.      * This note will not take effect unless the writer has the subject's face in their mind. Therefore, people sharing the same name will not be affected.      * If the cause of death is written within 40 seconds of writing the subject's name, it will happen.      * If the cause of death is not specified, the subject will simply die of a heart attack.      * After writing the cause of death, the details of the death must be written within the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds.     In addition to these basic rules, each volume of the manga has a page containing new rules or possible uses for the Death Note, and in one of the episodes of the anime it said "a human may shorten his/her life by writing his/her own name inside the death note".     so yes, it is possible.|`|vqg6wpCLaa	Yes, there is no exception. If a person's name is written in the Death Note they will die, even if it's their own. L did it in the Death Note movies, which do not follow the original stories.|`|efwvtzitaa	yes.

Love,  Socrates|`|wDJRyzE9aa	2|`|vH2OF9z8aa	you will have  Rapid progress towards a desired goal, brought about by immediate and decisive action. Boldness and daring in love, business, travel, or spiritual growth.    The card at the top right represents how you see your partner. Knight of Pentacles: The essence of earth behaving as fire, such as molten magma: One slow to action, but decisive and unrelenting once set in motion. A force of nature whose methods are as predictable and dependable as they are unstoppable. The voice of duty, honor, and responsibility. The will to the change the world, not through bold action, but through the thorough and unwavering application of proven means.    The card in the center left represents how you feel about your partner. Seven of Swords (Futility): An opportunity to withdraw from a hopeless situation and fight another day. Disengagement from a struggle you should never have been involved in. A desperate attempt to resolve a matter without conflict. The use of cleverness or outright deception to turn the tide in your favor.    The card in the center right represents what stands between you and your partner. The Magician: Mastery over word, mind, and matter. The ability to turn ideas into actions, handle problems, and control one's life. The initiation of new projects, great works, or a new way of life. Eloquent and moving communication. Arcane and eldritch technologies.    The card in the lower left represents how your partner sees you. Eight of Pentacles (Prudence): Dedicating yourself fully to a task. Learning a new craft or skill. Applying painstaking attention to detail. Industriousness and the efficient completion of tasks. Sticking with a project long enough to see it through.    The card in the lower right represents what your partner feels about you. Eight of Cups (Indolence): Losing interest in a matter deeply important to you. Being forced to abandon something in which you had invested great love and devotion. Seeking earthly, physical pleasures, to the exclusion of spiritual growth and emotional fulfillment. Emotional withdrawal and lethargy.    The card in the center represents the present status or challenge of the relationship. Page of Wands: The essence of fire behaving as earth, such as wood or coal: The surprising appearance of a new passion. An adventurer who blazes through life, acting as a catalyst that others may harness. The intense enthusiasm and childlike imagination that fuels any new venture, needing only the application of mind and material to make it a success. Inner fire that can drive away fear and replace it with fury. Can represent a person of some timidity, but whose innate passion can be easily ignited. May indicate the birth of a child.

They wanted something new and different.  Could there be a more perfect poster boy?  He was at the right place at the right time.  9 times out 10 if you want to be huge in music, you need to attract America.  Also, reggae is easy to listen to and it attracted a lot of people.  So now we have a huge musician that attracts young influential people.  (college kids or people in despair).  By this time, the Caribbean, african americans, and hippies know that Bob Marley is a hero, so naturally people are going to follow in his footsteps.  Rasta is an easy religion to belong to, so it spread well.|`|FjlFi6rxaa	Almost every song he wrote was about Rastafarian beliefs.

cidwIuJRaa	First off,It's HarukA NOT HarukU.And,your opinion gave me more of the feeling that her name is Amara in YOUR case.    If you watched the earlier seasons,you could easily see how much of a crybaby that Usagi/Moon is.That didn't change at the S season nor did it begin there.    Personally,I think that Mako would have went after Ruka even as a girl had Usagi & Minako not been around.    The reason that RukaMichi seems more mature is b/c they actually are.    Secondly,if eps are taking you 5hrs to d/l,they must be huge.Go to himura-kaoru.com & get her wonderful .rmvb's instead.    You should definitely finish the anime.|`|8a65aa558e9ad4329fd6cecf8635eb04aa	Sailor Moon SuperS and Stars are pretty good. I haven't watched Sailor Moon S for a while, so I don't really remember what happened in those episodes that made it seem like female homosexuality to you. If you're talking about Haruku, she and Michiru share some kind of bond; can't really say what it is.|`|cevQ8wq1aa	I have not seen the show in a while but I do not recall the feeling that HarukA and Michiru promoted anything. I found it pretty natural that they were "more capable", "more dignified and mature", "more responsible and professional", since they were a few years older than the other girls (I think there is a difference between 14/15 and 17, and each girl has a different character, Usagi (and Minako) usually behaved "like clumsy little girls").  As for their moral sense, I'm not so sure if that was really that much higher.     "Loving and making love to lesbians is something every girl just naturally wants to do, and any reluctance is a result of perverse and evil cultural brainwashing."  I remember one scene were I thought that it looked like Makoto had fallen in love with Haruka, and argued with a friend about it, she found it looked more like admiration (maybe a role model, not for being lesbian but for being strong and going your own way).  Also, since the Inner Senshi tended to easily adore cute guys, I don't feel that statement is valid.    As for the confusion of the girls at the Game Centre. They thought Haruka was a guy because she acted like one (hobbies, appearance), I would have been confused as well.    Not every episode revolves around Uranus and Neptune and I didn't find them to be that important but if it disturbs you that much you might consider stopping to watch.    EDIT:  Hm, maybe it's because I was a lot younger when I watched it but I didn't notice any messages. Thinking about it now, it could have been there though. But I wouldn't say it was as drastic as you feel about it.   The girls reaction in the temple makes it look like this is something not to be talked about, a tabu. And tabus are generally used when something isn't considered good.  Usagi thinking "it feels like I'm in the arms of a man" doesn't quite get that message through to me too. I don't think there's a general assessment behind it.   Especially since nobody in the show ever said that a relationship to a guy is bad. I feel about it the way that the show has an open-minded approach towards homo-/bisexuality, which is not a bad thing, is it? If you find that they give that message to blatantly there's not much you can do about it, either try to ignore it or stop watching.   When we watched the show we noticed Harukas and Michirus relationship but never found that they were "better" in any way. I actually didn't like them too much, I found them a little arrogant and annoying, so if they tried to have them as pro-lesbian messengers, it didn't work for me. (EDIT: Exactly why I didn't like her)  And I think the fact that Haruka looks and feels like a guy makes it less pro-lesbian since the girls only fell for her because she is similar to a guy. And I do not believe that a show like Sailor Moon is too much about hidden messages like that.    I suggest you continue watching and not thinking about any messages too much, it's more about entertainment than anything else, isn't it? (Plus the worst part about the season is, imo, Chibiusa, I really dislike that girl!)
AA12390047	Greenlee is run off a cliff on a motorcycle and Kendall is driving and Zach says to tell the police that he was driving.  Greenlee is presumed dead.  So, if BUdig wants to return, we've got another "dead" person back on the show.  Maria Santos came back too after her plane crashed and fell off a cliff.  Leo fell off a cliff.  Now there's one I would welcome back from the dead but it's not likely.|`|UY3zl9dFaa	Yes- I knew she was leaving, but I was hoping she would just leave town and maybe come back someday (hopefully to a better story line!) I like Greenlee and I'm disappointed with the story line since Rebecca's been back. But I saw the promo today where Kendall hits her with her car and Greenlee, riding a motorcycle with a bridal veil on, flies off a cliff. I hope, somehow, that she's not dead (so she won't have to come back from the dead or as a look-alike!)|`|AA12336927	I don't know how she will exit, but supposedly, she will exit. There have been rumors about Leo coming back to exit her out. This would be a perfect way to kill her off and bring on the tears. If leo's ghost came to his love to escort her home. HE not Ryan was the love of her life. I'm not happy they are killing her off, if they are, but I don't like the thoughts of someone else playing her. I hate that|`|NGNeT3rYaa	Great! I was hoping she would just leave town again, I don't want her to die! Maybe it will be one of those never find the body things or a faked death to get away from Annie. Dead never really is dead on soaps so hold out hope!|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	bye bye Greenlee....Sorry, I just can't get excited about her when she came back. I know of the two that played her, she was better but if she was coming back, she should stay for more than a 1. What in a another few years she will want to come back for another few months. Either come back and stay or don't come back at all.|`|gxl6oBpJaa	I don't like her. Of course I didn't really watch AMC during the whole original greenlee/ryan story, so I probably would like her better if I had've. I watched when Annie and Ryan fell in love...so anyway what kind of name is GreenLee anyway?|`|YI9cEtFvaa	no actually i cant wait to see how she goes ughhhhh i cant even stand looking at her. im hope shes done away with by annie.|`|ppE0GtkIaa	OMG, I was so happy when she came back. I love her with Ryan. What is going to happen to her? Is crazy Annie involved in her death? Why is Rebecca leaving the show?? Email me please? Thanks!! :o)    Why cant they kill off Erica Kane, I cant stand her, the little snob...lol I hate how she acts and goes around thinking she is so perfect and what is it with her and shaking her head all the time. She is such a fake...lol|`|nrqWwQBXaa	that is sad why are they killing her off she is finally happy?|`|ADBMrG87aa	It looks like GreenLee will die and it will probably be Kendall who kills her in a car accident and Zack will take the blame for it.  It sucks that they're gonna kill the character rather than have her move away.  It looks like there's no lasting happiness/happy endings in soapland.|`|p32zb497aa	yeah, i saw the commercial where Kendall hits Greenlee & then Zach takes the blame too. & it does suck, bc Greenlee is fantastic!  but of course, there's always hope of resurrecting a character in soaps. thats the beauty of fiction-- didnt the writers bring Taylor back in B&B saying that they actually buried a porcelain representation of her, & not the real thing?|`|Qe9y6MnTaa	YES! I am so sad. :( Plus, Kendall is going to crash into her with her car on accident, and that is how she is gonna die! So dramaish, but we are gonna here moping for like a year... but I do think it sucks, I was really liking Greenlee right now...

Cmun3Ec5aa	when you say 'simple' voice, i guess you mean like, not trained or nothing, just average?     - oasis's songs are pretty simple i suppose, (don't look back in anger, wonderwall, she's electric etc.)    - i'd say the easiest arctic monkeys ones to sing (for girls) would be 'a certain romance' + 'leave before the lights come on'. perhaps 'the bakery' if it's the right key for your voice.    - the last shadow puppets' songs are probably easy to sing too. 'my mistakes were made for you' + 'in the heat of the morning' (i know it's a cover but.. ) or something by the rascals.    - seeing as you're a girl, perhaps something by lily allen or kate nash? (she annoys me, but i do like 'foundations' and some others) i quite like lily allen's new song'the fear' which is no.1 in the uk.    - you might not have heard of 'the wombats' if you don't live over here, but they're pretty good too, and their songs are really easy - also good if you have more than one singer (for other parts).          hope i helped a little ?  have a nice day (:|`|6d08d4117b506d7d5e374a3b065bb49caa	Mercedes Benz by Janis Joplin and it is acapella no need for music|`|9E9h5WWwaa	Arctic Monkeys are awesome.

That includes the Beatles, (yeah I said it), and Nirvana! Nirvana is overrated, and only popular because Kurt Cobain died so young.

Because they were the best of their time, they were pioneers, and they have a sound that you just didn't hear before they came along.

My problems:    Jim and Pam. Ok, anyone who's ever watched TV knows that when the 2 people who are meant to be together but aren't finally do get together, the show is over. This is why "Friends" had that like 10-year-long Ross and Rachael sexual tension thing going on; it worked. Whether you like "Friends" or not, you have to acknowledge that the writers knew what they were doing when they had Ross and Rachael going on and off breaks every 10 episodes. It keeps the sexual tension in tact. I will admit that "The Office" has an inherent problem in this respect. Jim and Pam are too sweet to fight. Once they got together, we all knew that it'd be forever because they're a) meant for eachother and b) too nice to fight about little things (I mean Pam stuck with Roy forever... and Roy was icky). I'll go back to my converse example--Friends--here. The characters of Ross and Rachael are so exagerrated that they can get away with doing crazy stuff to each other and breaking up constantly. Pam and Jim are too nice and too real for that. I feel like "The Office" tried to transfer some of that missing tension to Angela/Dwight/Andy, which brings me to my next problem:    Angela/Dwight/Andy: Angela and Dwight's secret relationship was fantastic. It was strange and crazy: just like Angela and Dwight. However, their breakup (which was mistake  1) opened this horrible can of Andy-worms. Andy and Angela are a horrible pair; they don't even like each other! Their lack of communication (and sex, for that matter) is just unbelievable. No one can relate to their relationship, so it doesn't hold with an audience. Not to mention the fact that their relationship hasn't even been mentioned for 2 episodes after we were left with a cliffhanger... i mean wtf!!! Writers should NOT do that in the middle of a season. I assume they don't know where they want to take the love triangle yet, but they need to man up and pick a direction in which to take the relationship; they should have saved the climactic breakup for a season finale if they didn't know where it would lead.    Michael&Kelly: I agree 99% with what you said. The 1% is for Kelly... as ridiculous as her character is, she does make me laugh from time to time :)    Jan: Uhh... wasn't she pregnant? With a child that Michael might decide to care for? And then they just drop her out of the show... Michael never even mentions her anymore.    Stanley: He's heading in a Kelly direction, if you ask me. He's become too angry and confrontational in the last season and a half; it's unbelievable for his character, if you ask me. He used to just sit in silence with his crossword... that's how I liked him.    Overall dry-ness. The brilliance of this show was that it was real. In Season one, the plotlines could easily happen to people who went to work in an office. People could relate and they could see the silliness of their day-to-day. This was why the "mock-u-mentary" style of filming was so fantastic; it added to the effect of the show... it made you feel like you were there, which was great because, hey, you COULD be there! Now the plotliens are just too far-fetched. I mean come on: A "Fake" fire that doesn't result in Dwight's termination, Jim letting the office spend the entire day debating the hotness of Hilary Swank while Michael's away. Please.    I like your post. Hope you like my commentary :)|`|sq4BcGbIaa	try watching the english version of the office then.  after all...it was originally an english show in the first place  =D|`|zzO6Qalsaa	I love it, still makes me laugh.|`|QvjMJsaNaa	the older ones used to all be hilarious  there was just a long time of boring ones  but the one on after the super bowl was hilarious !|`|8WqTvPBbaa	I thought it was priceless last night when Dwight knifed the cpr doll.|`|AA10889282	The Office is not as funny as it used to be.|`|rYhnAkR3aa	i still think that it's hilarious. the episode after the superbowl was hilarious.|`|UCO7blmKaa	awesome!|`|Y6ki4IdHaa	that show is freakin funny i love that show|`|nXGMZerxaa	I think it's really funny. Sure the jokes are often stale, but it has a stable plot, and an excellent cast. And with the love connection of Jim and Pam keep the show from being a dopey show that tries to make you laugh.|`|cpl396lKaa	i will agree that the older ones were more funny  pam does look old and owdy and jim looks really young so its kinda awlward
3RKpLch8aa	I agree with you.   I have seen Slumdog Millionaire and it is really really good.   I haven't seen those movies, but i doubt they were as good as Slumdog.|`|XE2ejJ4waa	Milk and Slumdog Millionaire are the only movies on that list that I have seen. I liked them both, they were both amazing movies. I don't really mind which one wins though. It would be awesome if it was a tie, there has never been a tie in Oscar history so that would be neat. But yeah either one. Though if I had to pick just I think I would say Milk|`|CuFjK94Qaa	The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.  I do agree on your view on Milk|`|Iswn8gXiaa	agree, any other year, (exept last year, there will be blood was amazing and should have won) Milk would win but this year it cant against Slumdog|`|0xomluVRaa	i think MILK should win all the way! Slumdog Millionaire was good but i think Milk had the best cast and they all performed at their best.|`|YxUBB9Kwaa	Slumdog Millionaire will win.  I haven't seen it yet, but I really want to.  Out of the ones that I've seen DEFINATELY The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.

c4t75DK2aa	Paper bags and plastic hearts  All are belongings in shopping carts  It's goodbye  But we got one more night  Let's get drunk and ride around  And make peace with an empty town  We can make it right    Throw it away  Forget yesterday  We'll make the great escape  We won't hear a word they say  They don't know us anyway  Watch it burn  Let it die  Cause we are finally free tonight    Tonight will change our lives  It's so good to be by your side  But we'll cry  We won't give up the fight  We'll scream loud at the top of our lungs  And they'll think it's just cause we're young  And we'll feel so alive    Throw it away  Forget yesterday  We'll make the great escape  We won't hear a word they say  They don't know us anyway  Watch it burn  Let it die  Cause we are finally free tonight    All of the wasted time  The hours that were left behind  The answers that we'll never find  They don't mean a thing tonight    Throw it away  Forget yesterday  We'll make the great escape  We won't hear a word they say  They don't know us anyway    Throw it away  Forget yesterday  We'll make the great escape  We won't hear a word they say  They don't know us anyway    Throw it away  Forget yesterday  We'll make the great escape  We won't hear a word they say  They don't know us anyway  Watch it burn  Let it die  Cause we are finally free tonight|`|xJfVrAD7aa	instead of using your points on here, it is easier to just type it into google: "Great Escape lyrics by Boys Like Girls"   just thought I'd save you some points =)|`|BNtJnJ3Faa	Google it!

About 3 years ago when I was 11 and I told them I was 10.    LOL something funny happened but it didn't happen to me....

But I've never done it. That would be so embarrassing, to get thrown out of a resturant. ---Without being drunk!|`|WTf21t9Jaa	Nope, I don't think I could get away with the kids discount(I'm tall, so I couldn't pass as 12, even without makeup).   I could maybe get the adults menu(the drinks menu), though, since once, a server told me the martini special. I get that a lot..

0789e50a1396d5b6b9138ceaad0e64f5aa	I couldn't agree with you more H.  People who want to keep Todd in have no concept  that it is a competition, if it wasn't then there is no point having judges and points.  It isn't fair to the skaters who put a lot of hard work in  and are competing - it makes a mockery of the whole thing.|`|6d10196c158f49dbb02649f8773591d0aa	I think it is a case of the old british public fighting for the underdog and of course to P off Jason and the rest of the judges myself but do agree it is not fair but it is soooooooooooooo funny|`|aKhZNd7daa	Off course the Skaters making a better effort should be kept in H - But trying that to the Great British Public who love an Underdog - maybe Todd will do a John Sergent and resign gratefully !!!!!|`|SHeLdu8haa	Yes but where would be the fun in that?....lol|`|UlLpPuOTaa	As long as the public has the decision who's bottom two, it's always going to be more or less a personality contest.|`|lReSpTijaa	Yes in an ideal world that would be the case, but I think we have another Strictly John Sargeant fiasco brewing.|`|3a9f3003abdd986d136bc7307c02868faa	You're not the only one who feels this way Whip, but until there is a fairer voting system where it isn't just a popularity contest with the public this situation isn't gonna change.|`|hUZc273laa	Lets be honest the British public like to be entertained and alot of people find him entertaining!|`|gGZz2EGyaa	I agree rubbish skaters should be voted off and left to the judges they are.  However if they have a lot of fans then the fans will vote to keep them in.  Todd should have been voted out weeks ago, he is turning into the John Sargeant of DOI.  I have seen questions like this before about SCD and like everyone says it is an reality entertainment show and Todd is entertaining in his own way by being hopeless at skating.  I gave up voting myself I decided that some of these shows were becoming a farce and I was not wasting my money voting for anyone.  I love DOI and SCD and still continue to watch but not vote.|`|AA10077992	Perhaps if more people voted on the phone  we might get a different result. The phone calls will have to be cheaper though

She had them hidden all those years ago already. Simon was a child at the orphanage that was adopted right before all her friends were murdered. The old woman did not want the bodies of the children found.  Hope this helps, as I said I might be wrong; I watched it in Dec & Im trying to remember it.|`|tZUSVuUvaa	It has been awhile since I watched it also. The old woman was really Simon's mother and she killed the kids because they tormented her son and because they were inadvertently responsible for his death.

Most songs by them would be good. Once it's not too crazy, too sad. It really depends on the girl though, but don't change yourself for them. If the chick is into Screamo, get rid of her haha. But if she's hispanic obviously play reggaeton/bachata etc.,etc. If she's into Rap, then play that, whatever floats her boat. Just make sure you're into it to, don't want any accidents.   Good luck!|`|kK4GG6Z2aa	Wish I could answer this fully - am in my fifties...Katie Melua -Dido...are a couple of singers in vogue. (I like their style and have a few of their albums.  Good idea is to ask a girl what music she is into..especially if it's a new girl friend..it will please and flatter her if you have a copy of her favourite artist playing when she next gets into your car.  Of course they might even like some of the 60's golden oldies from Motown which is my generation of music which I love. Happy listening.|`|3533878a4dd2e1fbf5bf9526167668dbaa	Ask the girl what her favorite songs are and make a cd of them to play in the car. That would be sweet and thoughtful. She'll like that. ;]|`|wlL2X1yqaa	when a boy has rock music playing in his car, it is so cute. :)  bullet for my valentine, story of the year and softer rock is the best.  hope that helps!|`|NLwfMSJWaa	ask them what they like|`|cx1AmMd4aa	maybe some soft rock or acoustic? no depressing stuff or really slow stuff like hawthorne heights or radiohead     i've heard girls like dave matthews band and dashboard confessional?  well depends on the girl    but if you choose like crash into me by dave matthews band....you should really listen to the lyrics....|`|PSZEw34Kaa	try those specail uncatagrized songs    the latacy- tonight i love you  fray-you found me  theory of a deadman     ^^ gud luck bro|`|H2TvQ80Aaa	Lets Get It On- Marvin Gaye ;)))    Hey sometimes you have to come on a little strong lol|`|ZlFGwxzAaa	dude, i llike rap, just play wat u like, we dont judge :) but i gotta say, rihana, chris brown,and beyonce all rock! :3|`|I3z0Ed7paa	ask them what they would like to hear.

VUfT35UQaa	The saltwater room by owl city, a myspace band (just the one guy, the girl is only in his one song)    You cant get the songs on the UK itunes, only america.    --------------------------------------...  I opened my eyes last night and saw you in the low light  Walking down by the bay, on the shore, staring up at the planes that aren't there anymore  I was feeling the night grow old and you were looking so cold  Like an introvert, I drew my over shirt  Around my arms and began to shiver violently before  You happened to look and see the tunnels all around me  Running into the dark underground  All the subways around create a great sound  To my motion fatigue: farewell  With your ear to a seashell  You can hear the waves in underwater caves  As if you actually were inside a saltwater room    Time together is just never quite enough  When you and I are alone, I've never felt so at home  What will it take to make or break this hint of love?   We need time, only time  When we're apart whatever are you thinking of?   If this is what I call home, why does it feel so alone?   So tell me darling, do you wish we'd fall in love?   All the time, all the time    Can you believe that the crew has gone and wouldn't let me sign on?   All my islands have sunk in the deep, so I can hardly relax or even oversleep  I feel as if I were home some nights when we count all the ship lights  I guess I'll never know why sparrows love the snow  We'll turn off all of the lights and set this ballroom aglow    --------------------------------------...    http://www.myspace.com/owlcity

So, Pennsylvania Ave. might be slippery due banana peels thrown around by Obama...|`|dOkw3xhcaa	No. Thank goodness. Apparently it's painful. At leats it is in movies, games and what not. lol|`|V11l2Yk2aa	No, they actually aren't that slippery... the are overrated.|`|AA11758617	Yes, and they are slippery if the peel is inside-side down - you don't slide on the peel, the peel slides on the mush inside it. We were walking in a group and the people in front saw the single piece of peel and walked around it, we were right behind - walking pretty fast so didn't see it coming. I stepped on the peel and slid but didn't fall. My friend grabbed me when I wobbled, when I looked down and saw what it was I couldn't believe it, no way, this was for real. We laughed like lunatics. Hope that was my only time.

45Db0MJGaa	Susan Kohner  From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia  Jump to: navigation, search     Susan Kohner in Imitation of Life, 1959Susan Kohner (born November 11, 1936 in Los Angeles, California) is an Academy Award-nominated, Golden Globe-winning American actress. She is the daughter of Mexican actress Lupita Tovar and Jewish film producer Paul Kohner who was born in Czechoslovakia.    Most of Kohner's film roles came during the late 1950s and early 1960s, including co-starring with Sal Mineo in The Gene Krupa Story (1959) and with Montgomery Clift in Freud (1962). Her striking exotic looks helped get her the role of a part-Native American girl in The Last Wagon in 1956, and she would later be cast as the racially ambiguous Sarah Jane, her most notable role, in the 1959 color remake of Imitation of Life. The expensive, glossy Ross Hunter production starring Lana Turner was a box office smash; Susan won Academy Award and Golden Globe nominations in the supporting actress categories.    In 1964, Kohner married German novelist and fashion designer John Weitz, and retired from acting. Their children, Chris and Paul Weitz, are successful film directors in Hollywood, having helmed films such as American Pie and About a Boy.

Y1aAGPURaa	I wondered why the baseball was getting bigger. Then it hit me.    Police were called to a daycare where a three-year-old was resisting a rest.    Did you hear about the guy whose whole left side was cut off? He's all right now.    The roundest knight at King Arthur's round table was Sir Cumference.    To write with a broken pencil is pointless.    When fish are in schools they sometimes take debate.    A thief who stole a calendar got twelve months.    A thief fell and broke his leg in wet cement. He became a hardened criminal.    Thieves who steal corn from a garden could be charged with stalking.    We'll never run out of math teachers because they always multiply.    When the smog lifts in Los Angeles, U C L A.    The math professor went crazy with the blackboard. He did a number on it.    The professor discovered that her theory of earthquakes was on shaky ground.    The dead batteries were given out free of charge.    If you take a laptop computer for a run you could jog your memory.    A dentist and a manicurist fought tooth and nail.    A bicycle can't stand alone; it is two tired.    The optometrist fell into his lens grinder and made a spectacle of himself.    Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like an orange.|`|4NaBX5jfaa	y did orgo check all of his animal crackers in the box before eating them? he wanted to see if the seal was broken!!! hahahahahahahahahah no. it was from my math homework|`|NsayGX3Aaa	dead in the center of an island is a rabbit. 6 feet north is water, 6 feet south is water, 6 feet east is water, and 6 feet west is water. How many feet does the rabbit have to hop to get water from all four sides of the island?                        Answer- none! the rabbit is dead!|`|117deabf91c1ed299801ae60363d0378aa	Go to joke of the day! :)|`|LO3BMobRaa	1) This young boy walks in on his parents having sex and gets pissed. His father however just laughed at him, so the the boy walks down the hall into his grandma's room and starts having sex with her. His father walks in to check on him and sees what's going on, and yells, hey man WTF. Then the son says uh hun you see it's not so funny when it's your mama is it?    2) There was this sailor and this soldier that had both died in a war at the same time and they both arrived in Heaven at the same time. St. Peter came and gave both of them their wings, but he warned them that if at any given time they had any inappropriate or unclean thoughts, their wings would automatically fall off. Just as they had put their wings on, this beautiful angel shimmed passed them with a nice smile and smellying real flesh and clean, and the soldiers wings fell right off. Then when the soldier bent over to pick up his wings, the sailors wings fell off.    3) There was this stripper at this bar who was notorious for her split that she did at the end of each of her acts. One day she got ready to do her act, and right before she went on stage, a cat (guy) spilled a drink on stage and it didn't get mopped up too well. So this time when she got ready to do her split, she lost her balance and hit the floor so hard that it took two hours and forty five minutes to break the suction. You should have heard the round of applauses she got when she hit that floor (LOL).    4) There was this couple that had been married for ten years, and for their tenth year anniversary they decided to go back to the same hotel they were in ten years ago for their honeymoon. They went back to the hotel and even got in the same hotel room they were in when they honeymooned.They drunk champaigne and everything was just perfect just as it was ten years ago when they got married. They where starring at each other from across the room in their robes, then they took the robes off. At a given signal they ran towards each other, but since they had been drinking all that champaigne they missed each other and the cat flew right out the window like two flights down. The bell man came rushing outside because he heard all this noise. The man says get me something to cover myself with i'm naked here I need to walk through the lobby so that I could get back up to my room. The bell man says you don't need nothing to cover yourself with, if you want to get back to your room, you can just walk on through the lobby because ain't nobody in the lobby. The mans says what you mean ain't nobody in the lobby, the bell man says ain't nobody in the lobby because everybody left to go upstairs to watch 'em take this chick off the door knob.    5) A few days after Christmas, a mother was working in the kitchen listening to her young son playing with his new electric train in the living room. She heard the train stop and her son said, "All of you sons of b---s who want off, get the hell off now, cause this is the last stop! And all of you sons of b---s who are getting on, get your --ses in the train, cause we're going down the tracks." The mother went nuts and told her son, "We don't use that kind of language in this house. Now I want you to go to your room and you are to stay there for TWO HOURS. When you come out, you may play with your train, but I want you to use nice language." Two hours later, the son comes out of the bedroom and resumes playing with his train. Soon the train stopped and the mother heard her son say, "All passengers who are disembarking from the train, please remember to take all of your belongings with you. We thank you for riding with us today and hope your trip was a pleasant one. We hope you will ride with us again soon." She hears the little boy continue, "For those of you just boarding, we ask you to stow all of your hand luggage under your seat. Remember, there is no smoking on the train. We hope you will have a pleasant and relaxing journey with us today." As the mother began to smile, the child added, "For those of you who are pissed off about the TWO HOUR delay, please see the --*ch in the kitchen|`|3F8bCZ55aa	google joke of the day or comedy central

The movie was so-so. However, Breaking Dawn was disappointing since it kind of showed how much Stephenie Meyer needs to improve on her writing and plot devices. I  don't generally like to advertise that I read Twilight for these reasons, but it is a good past-time. Although not the best literature, and some aspects of Edward and Bella's characters are slightly disturbing.|`|lWL5Whinaa	I used to like it. I read it when it first came out and if your looking from just a literature point of view it's a really good book, but all the publicity is sort of nerve racking. It starts to get annoying when that's all anyone talks about and you can't go a single day without seeing someone somewhere reading it.     Personally i think the first book is the best, I felt like the rest of the books didn't have that special spark like the first because since she was pulled into a contract she was almost forced to write them from fans and publicists.|`|cuY5JMmlaa	i love twilight a lot. :]|`|YQrKQ5PAaa	I like it.

God I'm torn.|`|822da6b7b24693d516953606bfb56517aa	JEREMY  im not a big alice in chains fan|`|BgFf4S85aa	Rooster sucks!

R.I.P. Layne Staley|`|WnygliJfaa	Jeremy|`|ccBNNA5paa	"Rooster"  is the bomb.  And inspired by real life events.|`|kdo492J7aa	That is difficult, but I have to say Rooster.|`|QkhUkd97aa	Rooster  the vocal range is simply untouched by any other  R.I.P. Layne|`|bQvzfbYgaa	Alice in Chains' 'Rooster' definitely|`|crJTV0lmaa	Rooster.    I like the lyrical content more, it builds up better, its heavier yet lighter, Cantrell is beastly on the guitar work, and lastly, I love Layne Staley's voice, and Eddy Vedder's is just ok.  Just my opinion, but AIC over Pearl Jam any day :]|`|K7JfRjzMaa	wow. tough choice...but i think i'll go with Rooster.  Jerry Cantrell FTW

hJP9y6kjaa	Nooo, this is a bad idea!    Okay, so I've listed the Seymour Duncan master list of pickups below. As  you peruse the list, you'll notice a few factoids next to each pickup, including resonant peak, DC resistance, tone controls, type of magnet, etc. While technically DC resistance is NOT the same as output, most manufacturers don't want to give their pickups' output levels, and in the real world there is a decent enough correlation to at least get a ballpark idea of output.    Anyways, as you look through the list you'll see the Invader pickup. It says Neck: 7.2 k and Bridge: 16.8 k for DC resistance. Around 8 is low, around 16 is very high. I can say that this pickup set has a lower output neck pickup and a very hot bridge pickup (and yes, the Invader is super high output). If we look at the Dimebucker, it only gives numbers for the bridge - Bridge: 16.25 k.    Now I want you to scan the dc resistances of all the humbucker neck pickups. The highest is the Duncan Distortion neck pickup, around 12k, right?    Here's what the numbers don't tell you. You have to have stronger magnets to have higher output. Neck pickups have a naturally bigger signal due to how they're positioned on the string (they pick up more harmonics and vibrations), so they don't actually have to have as strong of magnets as the bridge pups. The stronger their magnets, the more they'll pull on the strings - and the more they pull, the more they'll affect your sustain!    That's the downfall of people who slap super hot pickups in their neck - they lose a lot of sustain, even if they get a mega hot tone for it all. What's the point of a super hot shredder tone if you can't maximize your sustain?    So back to the Dimebucker. 16k is just too much for a neck position. It will sound like crap (cuz it's too hot) and it will kill your sustain.      Let me give you two suggestions. First, the most popular pickup combination in the world - the JB (SH-4) in the bridge and the '59 in the neck (SH-1). The tone overall is a little trebly, cuts through the mix, but very round and natural sounding. I have the JB on one of my LTD's, and it has a very versatile, well-behaved sound that is equally at home in raging rock and jazz cleans. It's hard to go wrong with this pickup combination, although some will find them a little too bright to their personal tastes.    Which brings me to my second suggestion - I just put an Alternative 8 (SH-15) in my bridge and an Alnico II Pro (APH-1) in the neck. They're a great sounding combination - they match tones very well. The Alt 8 just rages, but it stays very clean and non-muddy, even in high gain, which helps it really cut through the mix. It has a little more chunk when dirty than the JB, and a tighter low end for more authoritative metal riffing (one of the criticisms of the JB is that it's not ideal for metal riffing). Both pickups coil-tap very well, and sound equally good clean as dirty. I get Slash-y style leads with the APH-1, and can go from funk to Strat-y to raging grind with this combination! My LTD is basswood, I'm using a 1 meg pot on the Alt 8, and I have a custom buffer circuit to keep the output low impedance, so while I have a pretty trebly sound still, your tone may be a bit darker.    Either way, get a low-output neck pickup. It will sound better, I promise! You'll be able to get better cleans out of it, and you'll still be able to pull of very decent leads (plus you'll get more sustain than you would with the higher output pups).      Good luck!      Saul
eGC4e44haa	What?
KBBonf97aa	Don't put too much stock in the opinion of one person, even if she is a vocal coach. The world is filled with singers who have different talent levels and styles and some of the ones who find success don't even have particularly great voices.  Macy Gray, for instance, has a very limited range and unconventional voice, but she developed a singing style that is unique to her.  Quite frankly, I'd rather listen to someone with an original vocal style than a multi-octaved windbag like Mariah Carey.    That said, "American Idol" isn't a great career plan.  If your goal is to become famous, the odds of you achieving it are about zero.  People who make stardom their goal almost never have success because they focus more on that than developing their talent.  If you're serious about becoming a singer, concentrate on that.  Learn an instrument so you can write songs.  A lot of singers think they'll have an easy time joining bands, but unless they have something more to offer than some degree of singing talent, they'll have a hard time convincing musicians they're serious.  I sang and played guitar in several bands and was regularly approached by girls who said they were singers and songwriters and would be interested in working with us.  But having a few words and a melody in your head isn't the same as writing a song.  We always dismissed those people, since they weren't interested in music as much as they were interested in being the center of attention.  They were just looking for people to do all the work so they could shine in front of an audience.    You don't have to be the best singer in the world.  But if you're really interested in a music career, you should get a guitar and take some lessons.  Eventually, you'll be able to write songs that are perfectly suited to your own voice.  From there you can start a band (or join one) and start playing shows.  Building a career is an incremental process and you won't get far unless you start at the beginning.  "American Idol" is just glorified karaoke.  The odds of you winning a career on TV are ridiculously small, but if you really want to be a singer, rather than a celebrity, that's something you can achieve.  But you'll have to focus on developing your talent, since that will be the basis for everything that follows.  Good luck!|`|QDH71AKvaa	well, that was rude of her. but maybe she was being honest and thought she was helping. if you want to go out for american idol, GO FOR IT! and sing all the solos you can for your church=]    best of luck and im sure you have a beautiful voice|`|0cJxF3qkaa	that was rude and mean.I LUV American Idol and they let a lot of ppl who don't sing great on all the time,then once they make it on they give vocal training anyways....plus u probably sing really good!!I wouldn't give up singing just cuz of a rude comment like that....plus what's so bad with church choir anyways lol!!!post a video on here ((or youtube)) and see how u do :)|`|lS0iN9K7aa	wow that was mean but i really hope to see u in American Idol one day, u have a nice voice :b|`|wA8Dyhq7aa	You might find this even more rude than what your music teacher said.  This isn't meant to be rude, however, it's meant to make you seriously think about what you want to do.    WHY do you want to be famous?  If you truly feel if you aren't famous you won't amount to anything, then you are 100% correct.  Being famous is the WRONG REASON to get into the music business.  If you are only interested in being famous, then the first time a door is slammed in your face or you get criticism (as is evident by the question) you're going to run.  No, there must be a passion and love for music that makes you want to play even if you're not getting paid for it.    I would also highly recommend that you study the horrors of the music industry before you decide that's where you want to exert your energy.  You might discover, as Dwight Yoakam once sang, that once you get to Babylon you'll find "the pie don't taste so sweet."    I know way too many musicians and singers who've been chewed up and spat out by "the business."

DMpVSHvXaa	"  What would you call an incomplete piece of Classical music? ?"    ... 2/3 of my output.|`|jbAr62ybaa	An "unfinished" composition is as good as any I suppose.  The most famous example of this is Franz Schubert's 8th symphony, most often simply referred to as the "Unfinished Symphony".         The standard number of movements for a symphony is four; but Schubert completed the first two with only sketches for a third:    http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=LlLADRH9Kb...                                                         Alberich|`|9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	Alberich is right - 'unfinished' is OK - or 'incomplete'. On several occasions, I have heard a chunk of music from an otherwise unfinished composition referred to as a 'torso'.|`|70jNDiIiaa	Surely it depends on HOW unfinished the piece of music is. If the composer only completed a tiny portion, maybe it could be regarded as a "fragment."     "Anna Magdalena's Notebook," for example, contains a few short keyboard pieces by J.S. Bach, referred to as "musical fragments."    Cheers,  Hafwen.

I hope the baby is given to Amy's Dads gay friends they seem like nice people that would be the best choice to take care of her baby!|`|GIso70HQaa	well this is my favorite show right now and i think ricky and amy are gonna end up keeping tthe baby and ben will be out of the picture u can see episodes at abcfamily.com|`|zyTvtgS2aa	They are trying to decide if they wnat to adopt.  but I do think they are in love with eachother. Her dad wanted  to give the baby to a gay couple and ricky said he will go with  whatever she wants. Grace found out Ricky is cheating on her.  I figure she is going to keep they baby cause thats the only way  to keep the show going.|`|f45b8ff41e1fa90ae65c8a0db95a90d1aa	i dont understand why everyone is in love with ricky. adrian grace and now amy. ricky is such a heartbreaker. but i think amy will end up keeping her baby and she and ben will break up because ben is too clingy and annoying.
g2GogSALaa	Depending on your level, it can range anywhere from beginner Suzuki-level pieces (or simplified versions of sonatas/concertos) to highly advanced works by Paganini, Lalo, Kreisler, Tchaikovsky, Sibelius...etc. etc.    If you really don't know where to start, you can look through the Suzuki books and find a various number of solos to choose from, based on your level. I don't like most of the Suzuki solos because I prefer less "cliche" solos, but it's the safest route to stick with.    Also, you can choose songs depending on what style you like. Vivaldi and Bach are both Baroque composers, and their songs have many of the same patterns and chord structures. If you like Romantic composers, go for people like Massanet, Dvorak,Tchaikovsky..people like that.    Keep in mind no matter what solo you pick, you're going to have to work hard and practice for a good result!    Have funnn :D|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	Any of the Bach Partitas|`|Rtzx1xKYaa	It depends on your skill level. You can choose a very difficult piece, but only if you have the time to practice it thoroughly to play it well. I am a cellist, so I can only recommend a piece that you will be able to play and not so utterly impossible that it was written by a composer that nobody knows. If that is possible...|`|qWNdhGVXaa	if you have finished the seitz vivaldi's a minor concerto or fiocco's allegro would be about right for you|`|tuATxHsVaa	You just finished a level 1 piece so you should move on to level 2. You should play this Vivaldi Concerto in A minor (he wrote A LOT of concertos so make sure you get the right one. Suzuki has the simplified version).    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzAVkJXei...    I believe it is in Suzuki volume 4.    The Seitz concerto that you just played should be in the same Suzuki book.

6PSnZDhDaa	let me tell you something that makes more sense...     I don't think Naruto can control the Kyuubi.. and thats definately not the kinda power he got from Itachi... It probably is the power to dispel Ametarasu and also to keep Sasuke from controling the Kyuubi... That is create a barrier that keeps Sasuke from entering Naruto's mind.. It probably something that will automatically activate at the sight of Sasuke's Mangekyou Sharingan....|`|uctxzjIIaa	Protection from the power of the Sharingan to subdue the power of the demons.|`|64Lgwm2faa	well i know one. And that power is that he is able to create shadow clones but he can do the shadow lcone sign once more and the shadow lcone explodes. And i think he wikll give him sharingan as well. because madara uchia used his sharingan to control kyubi because that was the only way. so if naruto has sharingan he can control the kyubis chakra at will. the sharingan is just a prediction but the shadow clone thing is true|`|IbWmNQFvaa	if i had to guess i think its the power to finally control the kyuubi because in the manga it said the only person who could control it was madara uchiha because he had the mangekyo sharingan. so i guess thats the only thing that kinda makes sense to me?    edit: alright i think sweetness is right|`|DEg4ioAvaa	I really don't know what kind of power Itachi gave Naruto, but I don't think it's going to be revealed during Naruto's fight with Pain. I think Itachi gave him some of his power to Naruto as a fail safe device should Sasuke truly intend to destroy the Leaf Village. I believe it is the means to kill Sasuke and save the Naruto World from total destruction.    Kyubbi stated that Sasuke's eyes reminded him of those of Madara's eyes and that its power was even more sinister than its own. I think Itachi knew just how potentialy powerful his brother will become as well as the threat of destruction Sasuke could pose.    Itachi asked how far Naruto was willing to save Sasuke even if Sasuke destroys everything Naruto loved, Naruto answered that Sasuke will never destroy the village. Then Itachi puts something in Naruto's mouth and said that he hoped that he never has to use the power on Sasuke.

It's for extra protection!|`|RzhbINzeaa	one-  can we wear slippers in school?|`|FgHwxPeGaa	Why do we have to look like retards?|`|9FLNHJtvaa	Why is the dress code retarded?!|`|YSdwkhHRaa	*Principal.    I've got one question.      Who are you protecting with this skirt length rule? The students, or the staff? |`|ozmqdlEbaa	1. what do you have against studded belts?    2. why do you continuously seem to catch us wearing studded belts but you dont see the mob of preps wearing 2 inch skirts?    3. Why do you allow high heel shoes (5') but not knee high boots?|`|IaRisw0Yaa	(1) How come male teachers, administrators, and office staff no longer have to wear suits and ties to work?  (2) How come female teachers, administrators, and office staff don't have to wear dresses and pantyhose to work?  (3) Why should students have to dress a certain way if adults don't have to? Shouldn't the teachers serve as role models for the students?    Remember, the principal is your pal. (That should help you remember how to spell principal, even if it may not be true.)|`|766d5b80d7a637c2204d9d127fb86200aa	Can you approve of the ladies wearing short skirts and low-cut tank tops?

ClRuPRs7aa	stephanie  I was really surprised. I thought Naomi was going to go home. It was very interesting because they went to Seattle. It was a hard decision for Jason to make. He really feels a connection with all of them, and he asked serious questions when he was on dates with the girls.|`|AOBEkqzXaa	I have yet to watch it myself and wondered the same thing!    I personally like Molly...she seems real.   Melissa is adorable but is too young for him I think.  Jillian is forgetable in my opinion.  Stephanie bothers me....she seems too nice. I know its not an act but I thought the way she ran up to her daughter was just a flashback to when Jason ran to his son w/Deanna...kinda cheesy.  Naomi is cute too but she just doesnt seem like she would fit into his life.|`|YP2xuZdtaa	Stephanie|`|AA12390047	Stephanie went home very graciously.  I think he made the right decision.

AA11546509	My favorite episode of Intervention was with that chick, Allison, who huffed aerosols. I laughed so hard during the episode, especially when she was like, "It feels like I'm walking on sunshine!" and when Animal Control took her cats away, lol.    Here's a video of it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IjBEf25A...
0UbWIuAMaa	If your looking for creepy sad music that is appropriate for school you can't go wrong with musical scores.  You don't have the problem of curse words or inappropriate content and you can get any number of effects from musical scores.  I'd look for movies with very tense scenes (if it wasn't so popular and therefore easily identified) I'd look for Harry Potter or Pirates of the Caribbean music.  But you can take music from dark movies, dramatic movies, or horror movies and achieve the effects you need.  Video games might even be another option...the music from "Silent Hill" is rather creepy.|`|3lDitjqKaa	get the Jaws theme or the one from Psycho and play it on a loop. They both give me the chills|`|ZQ3Cp7WHaa	A really great and famous classical music piece is "Adagio in g for strings and organ" composed by Albinoni.

Site is easy enough to navigate.   Only tick the box beside the blue circle which means all results will be entire songs as opposed to lists (which seem randomly generated and contain many doubles) or videos etc.  then click on the arrow to the right of the song title to add it to the playlist on the right.

nDQOwAA3aa	well why do people who save babys from burning building get more respect than child molesters but odb was thuged out a real og who yes he did make some crazy **** (dance if you caught up in the holy ghost tranc better STOP before you kill the ants in your pants) but not all of the music he made was bullshit now not all of wayne music is bullshit (man i miss my dogs) but he only makes bullshit now so lets add up the facts    odb  was arested multipul times  had a shoot out with the cops and got off  rapped with wu tang  was shot  and just kept it straight gutta     lil wayne    did get arested but thats because he was a feind not unlike odb but odb kept it real and smoked crack while lil wayne drinks cough syrup    shot himself as a kid   kissed bird man  and is now selling out more by making a rock album    so if you ask me odb gets more respect because he was straight up gangsta|`|9ceRmqUAaa	Oldb is hotter than this wanna be thug, oldb keeps it stupid gangsta and of part of the wu and i just love this niggas music i was listening to some of his MUSIC TODAY, miss him. oldb is a legend and wayne is wack OK.|`|1TgIuZMqaa	cuz....ODB was the Lil Wayne of ur generation....Lil Wayne is the ODB of this 1, u guys liked ODB then, they like Wayne now....its just the cycle my friend    BUT..BUT there is a difference.    The difference is, respect in the industry. And, believe it or not, Wayne is respected by pretty much everyone in the mainstream industry, more than i believe ODB was back in the 90's.|`|6fxr3VBGaa	simple ODB was a member of the notorious Wu-Tang Clan, killah beez, etc|`|mBQQL0kCaa	biased people|`|TRDkQciAaa	dont know. just how it is|`|BnTYoxUIaa	Because ODB was a Crazy Niggu and lil wayne is a GAY niggu.|`|42a3494c4c91e3621ec36d45d2b2ef4faa	lmao...  its true half the words that come out both their mouths have no meaning.    but crazy bums(ODB) are more funny than crazy crack heads(Wayne)|`|reNnLWh4aa	lil wayne is pop odb was the real thing|`|Jl9QAVAYaa	cuz odb is dead|`|F1SjcigGaa	ODB is the shyt    nuff said|`|qGOxMYpHaa	because their names are representative of their manhood|`|1238d8d31da2946a8a5f08dd1fdb4bcbaa	Lil Wayne gets more respect than ODB...|`|CNSGz12zaa	I don't respect either! Respect has gotta be earned and neither has done that in my opinion.|`|SkMjo0fNaa	I'd honestly say the Lil Wayne gets better hype. He's produced much more than ODB and doesn't have such a "nasty" persona. He's more diversed, into pop/electronica now and even talks about helping produce country. ODB never produced anything out of hip hop/rap.     Plus Lil' Wayne's latest cd went platinum more than once, so I'd say generally speaking Lil' Wayne is more popular to the masses. Which one is better? I dunno, I'm not a fan of either.|`|bLr5Wbmraa	ODB kept it real, he had his own style and he didn't give a f*ck about what people said. He brought that raw gritty energy to the Wu. Compare 8 Diagrams to other Wu joints, the energy is not the same|`|IFf5r9zAaa	ODB was anything but a subpar rapper. He was the drunken monk, it was all part of his Wu persona and as much as might might have sounded like he didn't have a clue what he was doing, he did.     ODB's style wasn't to everyone's taste and I'm not saying I'd put him on a top 10 GOAT list or anything, but he DID have skills.     The difference with Wayne is that he truly believes he's the greatest. There's no character there, no persona. He's not trying to give the fans theatre in the same way that ODB did. He geniunely is just making subpar music.    edit: It's not just about lyrics. ODB made better *music* than Wayne does. His delivery was miles better. Look at someone like Eazy E - nobody could say he was the greatest lyricist, but his delivery and his charisma made him an artist worth listening to. It's the same thing with Dirty.|`|NaHMdUASaa	Im pretty sure people give more respect to lil wayne than ODB...|`|Yj4i8eLWaa	lil wayne is way better|`|MjUentmjaa	who?|`|zIkWaYlCaa	i don't know. but i heard lil wayne is making a rock album.|`|MQb4I2w1aa	because little wayne is a sorry piece of ****. his rhymes are whack as hell. hes basically just a black ***** *** fake gangster. wanna hear real rap go listen to talib kweli or nas. odb gets more resect because his music actually takes talent. if i saw lil waynes short 5'3 *** in person i would kick him in the mouth. he has like 4 ghostwriters and hardly writes any of his own ****|`|CwaWiNzuaa	cuz odb was actually grimy lil wayne has been a millionaire since he was 15 hes no hustler and now he uses auto pitch **** lil wayne   odb was a shermed out thug from marcy projects dude aint rappin bullshit|`|LsMlGCeoaa	1st of all ODB is dead and was part of the most respected hip hop group ever assembled on Earth.........    2nd is that ODB was a real cat.  He was maybe crazy but he didnt change or put on a fake act for anyone, and he didnt sell out.  Many people can say though that Lil Wayne has changed his style entirely for commercialness, hired ghostwriters, and gone hip-pop and possibly rock now, and he's on every other song you hear on the radio so after a while even if you like Lil Wayne you have to get at least a bit sick of him if not more.........Those are your two reasons why people would respect ODB more......    R.I.P. ODB|`|ehfe97Zcaa	Because ODB had talent, was a part of one of the biggest rap groups in history, was (along with Wu Tang) at the forefront of a hip hop movement and had the respect of his peers (something you'd definitely know if you'd ever seen Method Man live).    Lil Wayne on the other hand is a flash in the pan, pop-rapper who relies on a tired old voice alteration gimmick to sell records.    It's chalk and cheese, mate.|`|UBdidsHYaa	If you really think about it, it is quite simple. ODB has been part of several classic albums. 36 Chambers, in a few tracks on Liquid Swords. And he had a very strong personality. He did what he want and his music wasn't exactly cliche you know. If Lil' Wayne actually been a part of some classic albums then maybe people would respect Wayne more. But lets face it, he hasn't ever dropped anything worth a damn. Carter I and II were AVERAGE at best. Carter III was absolutely terrible.    Plus... the Clan is FOREVER|`|fVYHV5Dnaa	why simple, cuz odb can make classic hip hop like ***** please, while lil wayne make garbage *** corporate music like lollipop just to get pay
rFBypeEfaa	There are a few brief windows during the mid 70s and late 80s where Aerosmith may have been the stronger band, but for any other historical era, including the present day, the Stones are better by far in my opinion    And they came first by 7 years...    Edit: Aerosmith have "around 20 very popular hits, while the b-sides are still great"...

c3MFIbeUaa	I belief it maybe has something to do with the thief befriending the joker to get close to his projected item of theft, While the saddened joker plays on the thief, reaps his reward of ill gotten gain from the king.   The princes still come through the night to the party and the only real loser is the joker as he will be condemned as to the quality of his performance though he is suffering.   Thus allowing the thief to sneak off into the freedom of the dark night. Leaving the jester(joker) to the mercy's of the court.   Thus no relief in sight if he does his job well.   Punishment if he doesn't impress the court for the Chief (King).   Moral of the story is too choose your friends well.   Fame can be fleeting and you are left to your own vices to escape and sometimes that is never good enough.|`|AA10569146	Don't they have a watch tower in Gotham ?|`|YbmklSzGaa	lol.    No I believe it's a made-up character.|`|sGBa8Gz3aa	Yes. Because he was talking to a thief, and we all know about the Joker and organised crime.|`|15251965e7a22606112c1db04af6445faa	OMG this is confusing i am going with wat everyone else is saying lol.|`|xU7AaQOdaa	I have always thought that this song is about the Crucifixion: the joker and the thief are the two crucified with Jesus, the princes being the apostles, women and servants those milling around the cross, and the two riders the other two parts of the Trinity.     That's what I was told at school when I was 16.|`|tc5vrfuiaa	I always thought it was THAT Joker...I can't be sure tho    I thought youd have known this! haha    ; p|`|XmD61yBpaa	no way hahahaha|`|5J8OZAJFaa	haha... Well nobody knows, but I wouldn't think so|`|YA4qCDukaa	lol   no it's about a different kinda joker.  sorry|`|f748148506cc661fbff33eea1e08daf2aa	There must be some kind of way out of here, says Jack Nicholson to the Chief    All along the watchtower baby, Withnail at the wheel...|`|ZOQrtm5zaa	A:  The Joker in the song has tired of the games he's been playing and asks his 'friend' the thief how he can get out of the web he has woven for himself.  "There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief!"  No, I don't think he's the Batman Joker - he's the jester of the castle in the song.    P.S.  How do you know this stuff?  That's Dylan's song and famous by Hendrix?  Isn't this way before your time?  And how can you tell such lies about being "shy and quiet" without kicking yourself back into the gutter?  You know perfectly well what I am talking about.|`|wUodHpEuaa	huh??????????????????/|`|fv2GAAdPaa	lol nope.

izL7WEzraa	it's a classic case of opposites attract.  a cancer is a quiet, sensitive, type. they would rather help others, and cope with them through their problems, instead of talking about their own issues.   a gemini, is the twins! lol they change their mind about everything. they are social. they love to go out, make new friends, and be the center of attention.  i give those two so much credit for putting up with each other for so long, because this relationship is usually one that would end quickly. the cancer would be getting their feelings hurt all the time, when the gemini didn't even mean to do it.  and the gemini would feel like their locked up at home, when they want to go out.  but to answer the initial question, they are so different, that they can't help being attracted to one another.|`|vifwGatdaa	I'm a July 7th cancer and only been involved with one gemini that I know of. He was a cool guy but I didn't really "fall" for him. I guess that was a good thing since he was the biggest liar I ever met (you mean she's not just your roommate and she's 6 months pregnant with your child? REALLY???). Now I'm with a Scorpio who I fell head over heels for and have been with him for over 10 years.|`|94zi1LFFaa	venus never falls far from the sun sign, so with cancer sun there is a high probability that their venus is in gemini... & a high probability that the gemini's they meet have their venus in gemini too... Venus is the love sign... it can spark attraction in cancerians for gemini's ... & if a cancerians venus is in cancer there is also a high chance that gemini's they encounter will have their venus in cancer as well... & that can bring attraction too...    ~peace|`|4KT1cXMBaa	No, but my birthday is July 15th...|`|tg89r7ZJaa	not true im a cancer and im inlove with a leo for 10 months now and baby on the way...

uctxzjIIaa	I'm fond of:      "Lost in Time": Quinn and Stormy get stuck in a 15-minute tie loop where they try (and fail) to prevent Sealab from blowing up each time.    "Murphy Murph and the Feng Shui Bunch": Murphy hires a questionable Feng Shui master to redecorate Sealab, including various changes that threaten everyone's survival.    "Der Dieb": A series of thefts results in Murphy declaring 'Martian Law'.    "The Policy": Sparks hatches a plan to save Murphy from credit card debt by taking out life insurance on other members of the crew and sending them into dangerous situations.    "Bizarro": The crew is held hostage by Bizarro World versions of themselves.    "Feast of Alvis": Murphy attempts to hold a celebration for an obscure religion.    "I, Robot, Really": A twist borrowed from a previous episode, Quinn is forced to give the rest of the crew robot bodies.    "ASHDTV": Sealab gets an Asteroid Smasher/High Definition Television that was supposed to go to Spacelab so they could stop the world from being destroyed by an incoming asteroid.
VaKhLMqxaa	Yes.  Very sexy.  Only because talent is sexy. lol :)    What I find the sexiest is,  if she can play AND sing.  That's attractive.  Almost anyone can learn  an instrument,  but if you have vocal skills,  it's 10x hotter. lol  Not saying that playing an instrument is easy.  lol  I've played piano and guitar for years,  and I'm still not exceptionally good at either of them.   -_-|`|y0hpaZi2aa	Not neccesarily.

tuATxHsVaa	I don't say this to be mean but...    There are plenty of self-taught musicians out there; however, this is the classical forum. A classical musician should have a piano teacher.     1) Get a piano teacher  2) Learn proper technique  3) Avoid injury in the long run because you learned proper technique.    There are websites that have free lessons. Just search for free piano lessons. Here are some examples:    http://www.gopiano.com/  http://www.free-online-piano-lessons.com...  http://www.zebrakeys.com/  http://www.learnpianoonline.com/welcome....  http://pianonanny.com/  http://www.playpianotonight.com/    search for "learn to read music free" -    http://www.notationmachine.com/how_to_re...  http://datadragon.com/education/reading/  http://www.largemart.com/    and etc.    Just search for "free piano lessons"    You'll find so many it's ridiculous.     I still say to you loudly and clearly: Please find a teacher if you can afford lessons ($25-50 per lesson usually).    Sure, you can self-teach yourself. It probably will take double the time. You can learn so much more from a professional than you can on your own. Don't you inherently know this already?    Cheers, and have fun with it.|`|gDxjINbQaa	You play better when:    1. You learn how to READ MUSIC.  2. You learn the process of trial and error.  3. You learn how to practice effeciently  4. Lastly, but most importantly, you learn human anatomy and proper technique to avoid harm.

f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	Personally, I like Virgos.  However, I've seen the effects of a Virgo male/Sagittarius female relationship and it's not pretty.    Virgos are very analytical people and they ask a lot of questions.  They will question your every move and Sagittarians need their freedom.    Also, because Virgos are so used to being seen as perfect, they'll never admit to being wrong and will resort to accusing YOU of doing something wrong when they're the grimy ones.  If there's one thing a Sagittarius hates, it's falsely being accused of lying, since they usually tell the truth.    But, if you really want this person, go ahead.  It may work for you.|`|HQ4PsETWaa	Get him to your house.  When he shows up answer the door naked.  This will work for any man, he will instantly want you.|`|RlZvWkSIaa	Be very practical and try to make things perfect. Remember, Virgos are perfectionists.|`|5y4uMfIvaa	Virgos are really jusy more secretive scorpios, although they are very misjudged and have been put into this nitty picky prude sterotype.    Just make things comfortable and connect emotionally to him.. cosy up...get candles.......etc.
a1Ngi39Xaa	I thought Bruce and his entire band did an excellent job.  I'm not the biggest Boss fan in the world but I totally enjoyed it.  He also looks great by the way (and I think he's 59).  He looked like he was having fun and so did the crowd.      Best of all, he did not have a wardrobe malfunction!|`|4KT1cXMBaa	idk, I only watched 2 seconds of him..|`|6c7e9e289fd5db36cd934c29dca6003eaa	Springsteen is far from the boss.  He is more over rated than Weezy and will never be as good.|`|1vCoaf08aa	He did do awesome, eff anybody who disagrees.    Lil' Wayne, ugh.|`|cUjcn2lsaa	His performance was decent. But Lil Wayne is NOTHING compared to Springsteen!    I honestly don't know why R&P hates The Boss so much.......maybe because he's popular?    Just because something is popular doesn't mean it's bad. That's what I hate about R&P.|`|2i6TPlauaa	I lost the little amount respect I had for him last night.     'Put down that guacamole!'|`|ebxwADDcaa	he did suck.     better than lil wayne, still terrible|`|qif1TQtnaa	Yeah Lil' Wayne sucks just read this... wow.    http://www.metrolyrics.com/la-la-lyrics-...|`|JitXVZp3aa	springstein was horrible. thats all i have to say.|`|b9MSOr6laa	my mom loves him and forced me to watch but he SUCKED!|`|yJCLcFVwaa	Bruce Springsteen is an idol and if he told that to someone that was a fan he'd be in trouble as Bruce is older but he's just as good as he was and Lil Wayne will never Be the Boss.|`|JXTLpgUoaa	He seemed a little bit out of breath, but hell .. its been 20 years since I've seen him.  He looked great.  I never liked him a lot until I saw him live back in 85.  I was in Germany at the time and he was on his Born in the USA tour and was selling out multiple dates in minutes.  You couldnt get a ticket in the US.  Anyway I was in Germany and one of the nice things about Germany was the concerts.  Country the size of Oregon but when a band toured Germany they hit several major cities.    I could get a ticket so I did.  I'm open minded like that.  Figured what the hell.  I'm here.  I can go.  I should go.  I might even like it.    You know it was one of the best live performances I have ever seen anyone do?  Freaking 4 hour concert and he and the E street band only took a 20 minute break half way through.  I dont know if he can still pull off shows like that now, but but it was pretty impressive, and he had a LOT of european fans over there too.|`|gbm71puSaa	I think he did allright. He tried to give a high energy performance. He did better then the stones did a few years ago. But I think Prince did better then anyone whos done the half time show in the last few years|`|ONWCXzUMaa	Sorry never watched the game but I can't see Bruce suck, he is great at what he does  take care  dave|`|B8Gwxo1laa	Springsteen rocked.|`|JDUi0mbiaa	bruce springsteen WAS really good. why does everyone hate him?! and lil wayne will always suck. if you call what he does successful, youre crazy.

5bd05c7fa78a69fcd566818bb048a2bfaa	I love t.A.T.u.!    One of my favorite bands is a German band, but they don't have German songs. They're Japanese (and t.A.T.u.) influenced, and sort of a dance/pop band, but I have yet to find a band quite like them. They also have a new album out sometime in the spring, and I think you'll like them.     and they're called Cinema Bizarre haha  my favorite songs by them:  Other People  Forever Or Never  Lovesongs (They Kill Me)  Dysfunctional Family    you should definitely check them out :)|`|kp5l6elraa	Mogwai- they're Scottish, mainly instrumental, they're cool  Aural Vampire- from Japan  the song 'Me Gustas Tu' by Manu Chao is catchy :.)

Why?  three words.  Hailey Williams' hair.|`|PmadQI3iaa	I enjoy flyleaf more. because it has a lot more rock than paramore.   the lead singer of flyleaf, lacey has such a unique voice. It's really nice. she screams, and she can pull it off. And her songs have deeper meanings of faith, and love and the future. She's been through a lot in her life, and she still survives. its kinda inspirational. Flyleaf goes to countries in Africa and sings there. Its just that they give back. i just love it sooo much.I know paramore is more popular, but ehhh... i listened to the (Paramore) riot cd and the flyleaf cd. I like the flyleaf way more. And the girl in Paramore sometimes sounds squeaky. There are lots of electric guitar solos in flyleafs songs, its just totally awesome. hahah... this is a big answer. lol

c4t75DK2aa	idk sing on school campus during a break (if you go to school)  you get recognized  heard, and seen    and people can see you as an individual, song writer/singer  i think its the best way to start from there  youmight end up playing at a party...then get booked at a gig.  so people can see your talent. and  if they like it...cool (:  just do your own thing...no buisness crap|`|AA11378460	Why would you want to be discovered?  There's no money in writing original songs.  Why not write your songs and post them on youtube.  If you just want to be famous try another avenue as there are way too many people competing to be popstars.

4Ct2FpjOaa	Well, you see.....this is one of the reasons that celebrities date celebrities.        Time together and being more understanding of time apart. The stars will know how busy the celebrity life is, and the chances of them seeing each other at big events is more likely, too.    Other than that, yes of course it is plenty possible. Celebrities date non-celebs as well. It is just much harder.|`|LRLu1ofNaa	There is a little chance. If the celebrity and the non-celebrity fall in love, it is possible for them to date. But that is pretty unlikely.    And, you know what, it's not all about looks. Most people care about personalities, not looks.|`|kHY0eMVraa	There is a big chance. Celebrity go with up with non celebs all time.|`|lM2x2i0maa	I think there's a pretty good chance. Some celebs actually WANT to date regular people/fans. You just gotta meet them first and be lucky cuz they can date whoever they want.    And if they're actually worth it, they won't care about looks :)|`|X7W3Zs08aa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsRr3RnIB...      hope this helps!|`|35f61873279b7d3751515927d7e1ad9aaa	well one summer I was in college in LA and was working as part of my internship on Frasier.

I even went with him to the wrap party of Frasier as his girlfriend. Oh and he was the best lover I ever had.

h6JJNgoKaa	The recession hit my area this time in June.   I went down in students for the summer months and then it never went back up.   I have had a few new students since then.  I normally average about 25- 30 students. I am down to 15-20.  This is the same way that it went for me at the start of the last recession (I have been teaching for 30 years).  The students will come back a few months before the absolute end of the recession.|`|ThKkn5fKaa	I'm sure that a small sample size like this probably won't give you incredibly accurate results; case in point, I've actually grown in number since the recession started.  Over the past half-year or so, I've gone from  6 students up to 8 now, losing 1 and gaining 3.  Granted, I've only been doing this for a year, so I'm definitely still growing in terms of numbers.  I think one thing that might help me is that I mostly have high school age students.  For them, music is probably not some passing fad and none of them are being forced to do this by their parents.

hGTuCqeEaa	According to the Dizzy Gillespie autobiography "To Be or not to Bop", bebop peaked around the time of the feature story in Life Magazine October 11, 1948 entitled "Bebop: New Jazz School is Led by Trumpeter Who is Hot, Cool and Gone." It declined as the "cool" sound (usually thought of as beginning with Miles Davis' "Birth of the Cool", which was released in 1949) came to the forefront of jazz.|`|siTibEIGaa	See, I feel that what Miles did after the "cool" era was an extension of bebop, and I usually just call it "bop". ESP, all the way to Files de Kilimanjaro. It's all just titles anyway. But the peak was definitely the mid to late 40's, with Diz, Monk, and Bird leading the way. I think it officially died out when Bird died out, though great bop has been made since then. Check out Miles auotbiography. He talks a lot about that era, when he was coming up. He came up as all the bop artists were moving to Paris, getting electroshock therapy, and od'ing on junk.|`|CwT9db3zaa	Charlie Parker and Dizzy really were the peak of bebop jazz. They were the MAIN guys and they were awesome. This started out over on the east coast. Then on the west coast, miles davis started his cool, slow, chill style. Then he became the main thing and so did that style.

Fh2diWzvaa	Making copies is legal for page turn, inserts and practice parts and is done often for performance material. In the U.S. there is no need or law that states that the parts must then be destroyed. The important fact is you bought the original printed music and did not deprive the copyright holder or publisher of the money due to them.|`|vsy4QMHMaa	I'm sure that would be acceptable use.

066dbddb6348f26dd20544e15c95797caa	I LOVEE R&B, and no one can change that..  from the smooth soul r&b to the hyped out dance ones.    ever since i was little, r&b was my first favourite music genre, along with rap, and hip hop but r&b has that more of a spark for me and always lit up my heart.   i just love the deep content that r&b gives out.. love songs from the soul mostly.   the smooth, hip, funky and rhythmic beats.. the lyrics.. i can always relate to them..  r&b has always cheered me up when i'm down..  or when i'm down, i can just listen to r&b to help me let all the emotions out.  i also sing r&b.  it's just one of those passionate things that you can't let go.|`|ZHi6lgnlaa	because its nice to listen to when u want to relax|`|3n4EIP8vaa	Im not the kind of person who listen to R&B but I love it you know. Cause the some of the music fits perfect in my situations. Best R&B song I like is Still In Love by Tyra B. I just love that song so much.|`|SAaEiqHvaa	for myself, i was bought up with old motown and classic rnb... where i grew up in NZ and as a Maori(indigenous New Zealander) alot of my family went to vietman, and found that the afro-american struggle for indipendance was very similar to our own in NZ.. as that was the case, an influx of black american culture was addopted by the NZ maoris. as a rythmic people ourselves, the structure and even movments appealed to us in many ways..     i love the way it makes me feel, and sometimes the alclarity of thought that can be had by just chillin and listening to an old classic, or even a new hit.. its one of my favorite genres, and even when i tried to rebel against it, it always bought me back..|`|dKMgqCynaa	yea..i love it...    -its soulful  -its deep in meaning  -its relaxing and mellow  -you can sing along to it and relate to the situations    its jus a very heartfelt genre|`|kGYL8a4Yaa	I like listening to R&B because it can give me answers to certain situations.

AA12301664	is it show starts at 5, or doors open at 5?    first act - 45 mins after doors open, play for 20 or so mins.  with 3 bands to fit in, i would expect a pretty quick turnaround, and that they'd all play for about the same length of time.    support act - 7.45 ish - play for 40 mins    main act - 9.00 ish - play for an hour.    10.15 finish    something like that anyway.  you could always phone the venue?

tuATxHsVaa	Well it does involve both sides of your brain more intensely than a lot of guitar music does. This is because each hand is tied to a separate hemisphere of your brain. Sometimes your hands are doing completely different things and you have to develop a feel for this.     All things considered, many musical instruments are easy to learn and hard to master. Almost anyone can learn to play simple things on the piano, and likewise on the guitar. You are eventually going to run into difficulty no matter what instrument you pick up.     If I catch the drift of your question.. then I must say... the piano does not present the same kind of difficulty that an instrument like horn or oboe presents initially. To put it in another way, any fool can hammer out a little tune on the piano - but most people will not understand how to produce a tone on the horn or oboe worth playing with at first.    Hopefully you love the piano so much that you will stick to it no matter what, eh?    Do you still enjoy the guitar? I hope so =). Reading music will definitely help you out.|`|79L0T9bIaa	It depends on how determined you are.  Just like the guitar, you can play a lot of songs once you've learned the notes.|`|h8hdK128aa	I agree with Court Violinist. It depends. The piano is probably the easiest instrument to play; all you have to do is push down a key to start playing. I've played for years without a teacher when I was just a young lad     buuuutttt     later on you'll want to control just HOW you push the key.   Just a word of caution; piano has it's (avoidable) dangers just like any other instrument if you play it wrong. Tendinitis in the wrist and Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is popular so I (and the rest of the piano playing population) suggest playing the piano the correct way first so you don't form any bad habits.   Other than that, it sounds like you're good to go!

QelWHSZRaa	Darn it hon....    Us aqua are the best ....tanx LOL  Us dude take a while to get attached and stuff but we are loyal once we do. Aquarius is the sign that divorces the less hon.

She ain't know the difference darn it.|`|LyDd0m7Waa	Aquarius are the best match for Gemini so it's no surprise that you like him so.

They're very similar to Sagittarians in that they say what's on their mind.  The difference is that Sagittarians, upon realizing that they've upset you, will say,"Whoops!  Just kidding!" (they're lying).  An Aquarius would say, "Oh, I've upset you?  Oh, well".|`|VHxZuaOfaa	no they tell the truth|`|PCAlAoDsaa	No, they are very honest and blunt. They tell you the truth.|`|to6JW3yFaa	Haha it's complicated.    If you ask them a direct question like "Do you love me?".... be prepared for the blunt truth. They will tell you if you ask them directly. Haha that's why Im never going to ask my Aqua that cause I dont want to be disappointed. I'm just gonna wait for him to say it when he's ready. But if you really want to know what he's thinks about you, ask him, and he'll probably tell you.    On the OTHER hand, it's very hard for them to tell you anything emotional w/o a push. Like whenever Im about to get off the phone with my guy he always says some mean things jokingly (his own way of being affectionate) because it's hard for him to be lovey dovey. And then when I say "Haha wow you cant EVER say anything nice to me??" He just says "I know what is on my mind and I know what I want to really tell you, but I just cant say it." It's reallllly hard for them to get sentimental at times. They just need a small push. (Just dont act over emotional or clinggy). And they will definately try and be more open to you if they really care about you and know thats what u really want.    Of course this is all from my observations. Im not an Aqua, Im just dating one.     Best of luck!! :)|`|izX7ymibaa	NO. They are usually quite honest. Painfully honest, in fact.|`|V8tfSJWHaa	All people are capable of being honest and dishonest.  Zodiac Signs mean nothing when it comes character or integrity.    Watch his body language and eyes when you ask questions, and trust your instincts.    If it feels wrong, then it is wrong.  Your right match will feel comfortable and completely trustworthy.    If you find you are having continual problems finding someone you can trust, then it is time for some personal introspection.    Love,  Socrates|`|F32mOSMEaa	when we speak. we speak the truth.

t5Mz1aLvaa	starting piano? good for you...    alright for a starter piano, just get a normal piano. i mean, nothing big. Getting a used piano is good, i mean, when i first started playing, my mom got a used piano for me to practice... and it works out great....     if you wanna try some stuff out that's creative. get a full keyboard, so you can try some effects or something?     it also depends on how long you wanna practice and want kinda songs you wanna play.     Practicing long: get a piano that can stay in tune longer, so your music sounds right, and not weird...    songs: if you wanna play soft songs, then any kinda piano. but if you wanna play songs that you have to hit the keys, "phantom of the opera for example which is where you have to 'pound' the keys to get the full effect" then get a piano with sturdy looking keys, and wont break under the weight.     also get one where all the keys work and stuff..    hope this helps in some kinda way. hope that you enjoy piano... i have for the last 7 years XD so if your really into it, then you sould go far...|`|FCFdYuchaa	confirm  http://classical-piano-guide.blogspot.co...|`|DMpVSHvXaa	Anything as long as it's in tune and all the keys work.

lcj1AKt1aa	These are the lyrics.  ONE WEEK  By: Barenaked Ladies  Submitted By: lotznforty@bolt.com    It's been one week since you looked at me  ****** your head to the side and said "I'm angry"  Five days since you laughed at me saying  "Get that together come back and see me"  Three days since the living room  I realized it's all my fault, but couldn't tell you  Yesterday you'd forgiven me  but it'll still be two days till I say I'm sorry    Hold it now and watch the hoodwink  As I make you stop, think  You'll think you're looking at Aquaman  I summon fish to the dish, although I like the Chalet Swiss  I like the sushi  'cause it's never touched a frying pan  Hot like wasabe when I bust rhymes  Big like LeAnn Rimes  Because I'm all about value  Bert Kaempfert's got the mad hits  You try to match wits, you try to hold me but I bust through  Gonna make a break and take a fake  I'd like a stinkin achin shake  I like vanilla, it's the finest of the flavours  Gotta see the show, cause then you'll know  The vertigo is gonna grow  Cause it's so dangerous,  you'll have to sign a waiver    How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad  Trying hard not to smile though I feel bad  I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral  Can't understand what I mean?  Well, you soon will  I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve  I have a history of taking off my shirt    It's been one week since you looked at me  Threw your arms in the air  and said "You're crazy"  Five days since you tackled me  I've still got the rug burns on both my knees  It's been three days since the afternoon  You realized it's not my fault  not a moment too soon  Yesterday you'd forgiven me  And now I sit back and wait til you say you're sorry    Chickity China the Chinese chicken  You have a drumstick and your brain stops tickin'  Watchin' X-Files with no lights on  We're dans la maison  I hope the Smoking Man's in this one  Like Harrison Ford I'm getting frantic  Like Sting I'm tantric  Like Snickers, guaranteed to satisfy    Like Kurasawa I make mad films  Okay, I don't make films  But if I did they'd have a Samurai  Gonna get a set a' better clubs  Gonna find the kind with tiny nubs  Just so my irons aren't always flying off the back-swing  Gotta get in tune with Sailor Moon  'Cause the cartoon has got the boom anime babes  That make me think the wrong thing    How can I help it if I think you're funny when you're mad  Tryin' hard not to smile though I feel bad  I'm the kind of guy who laughs at a funeral  Can't understand what I mean?  Well, you soon will  I have a tendency to wear my mind on my sleeve  I have a history of losing my shirt    It's been one week since you looked at me  Dropped your arms to your sides  and said "I'm sorry"  Five days since I laughed at you and said  "You just did just what I thought you were gonna do"  Three days since the living room  We realized we're both to blame,  but what could we do?  Yesterday you just smiled at me  Cause it'll still be two days till we say we're sorry    It'll still be two days till we say we're sorry  It'll still be two days till we say we're sorry  Birchmount Stadium, home of the Robbie        A-Z artists|`|8FLUau0faa	"One Week" by Barenaked Ladies  Video:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsFjqpc-x...

QK4r41Hqaa	Ayu no Monogatari: very mature, I'm pretty sure the fist few pages are Ayu selling herself to old men. It's pretty graphic, but ends up wiht a (sad!!!!!) nice story    there's spin offs: one about the dog Pao (pao no monogatari) and her friend (I can't remember the name :( though) and the other about a boy that's relationship I'm not going to mention due to spoilers)    it's amazing!    and other one is Cut (by KAWAI Touko)  it's a yaoi.... sweet romance, and lotsa cutting. That's kinda the theme...  Nice happy ending ^-^    And a movie called Suicide Club, very interesting consepts. But, also really hard to understand.

izX7ymibaa	What you're experiencing is the intensity of the Scorpio-Taurus opposition: you both have what the other lacks. There will be almost compulsory attraction between you because you are pulled magnetically, even against your wills. My advice is to be kind but maintain a distance. Because the energy between you can be very distructive for you both. It's not who wins or loses here: if you get into those dangerous waters, you could both lose.|`|WIczM4URaa	based on what youve stated, you will both lose if you stay together.     youre right in saying that you simply dont want to hurt his feelings and he feels same way too. but theres nothing more to it than just wanting to stay friends or cordial before the inevitable break up. however as you both mistake this as love ( that instance when either comes back ), you both hang on and end up in this same cycle of hurting each other more and more.     as a taurus you may be thinking you can change scorpio and make it work and you can be very persistent and stubborn on this. but taurus also expects much in return and makes demands on scorpio which he will reject as an attempt to dominate him.  his unbending will and your persiverance therefore often clash.|`|3QpAqd1xaa	i know losers and winters from both signs|`|uOCMo7IUaa	the person who believes in astralogical signs....  jkjkjk  i have no idea|`|MWe4hMm1aa	well you're a bit of a loser for asking such a silly question. a sun sign in no way defines a person. people of the same sun sign can be as different as night and day.|`|d1X9zICiaa	taurus is the loser.|`|U7Tz5vI8aa	Scorpio's rule

g2GogSALaa	To the first answerer:    Beethoven is most definitely NOT American...wow.    It really does depend on one's opinion, but I definitely think George Gershwin, Aaron Copland, Leroy Anderson, Samuel Barber and Leonard Bernstein tie for "Greatest American Composer".    Gershwin wrote amazing jazz pieces, Copland's "Hoedown" is used in like..everything...even beef commercials haha, Anderson's "Sleigh Ride" is played every year during the holiday season, Barber's violin concerto is extremely famous, "Adagio for Strings" is extremely famous and beautiful, and Bernstein's orchestral works were sooo epic :D    So I think all of those American composers are great, and not one of them "exceeds" the other by much.|`|vsy4QMHMaa	Gershwin, Copeland, Berlin, Strayhorn, Joplin, Ives, Souza, Ellington, Foster ....     ... some jazz, some classical ... it's all good.|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	There can only be one "greatest", I assume that you meant "great"    America has produced few outstanding composers of art music    I enjoy Elmer Bernstein and admire Charles Ives    Copland is rather second rate|`|MjJUybHPaa	Led Zeppelin....

CEEQDSCFaa	yea its completely natural, insecurities help us make our self better, and the constant underestimation of your abilities is what will catapult you on top    it only means you want to be more than what you are right now, you can accept it and be content or do something more to make a difference, so keep at it. you have ambition for world domination i think thats great :]|`|1yTe0jfRaa	My brother is cap and he is great at his job, but he has a lot of career problems.. so that's something interesting.    However, my other brother is also a cap and things are going well for him.|`|Wdrzhb3Saa	Even though I'm too young to have a career, Capricorns are very down-to-earth and have deep feelings about things. Often, if they're is something that bothers them, they become negative and pessimistic about other things until whatever's bothering them is out of the way. So yeah, if they're not satisfied with their career, they can be depressed.|`|Kn90YAzYaa	Yes, especially now, since I don't have one anymore.|`|d1X9zICiaa	YES !|`|3QpAqd1xaa	I think they think too much|`|lOkWLI9Caa	I'm not a Capricorn, but I know a guy who is self-conscious about the type of job he does. I guess he feels embarassed about it, but he is going to college and desires to be successful.

Lastly, what Anime has the most fans.    ~~~Sadly, Naruto....but from worldly observation....One Piece is coming close. Ish.|`|njToL09Yaa	Sorry guys, but I'm gonna have to call it quits.   >>At least try to make it to 50!     1. What did you guys like about these things?  >>Wellllll, I've only done like one of these things, besides this one, but they are fun.     2.

Poll, Bleach, One Piece, or History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi? Which one of these should overthrow Naruto on onemanga?  >>One Piece.     5. There's a book that falls from the sky. It's a future issue of Shonen Jump that just so happens to have the last chapter of Naruto, Bleach and One Piece, and the epilogue. What do you do?  >>Read them all, and hope that the last chapter of Naruto is THE last one.    6. Lastly, what Anime has the most fans.  Naruto, obviously. And then Bleach or One Piece...your basic mainstream anime.|`|nUOw6rOgaa	Calling it quits eh? :(  I think you'll miss it...you'll be back.... ^_^      1. What did you guys like about these things?  -They're funnnnnnnnnnnn.  Come on, you know you make good surveys. Lol.    2. Who would win in a fight between Bleach's top ten fan favorites vs Yu Yu Hakusho's top ten fan favorites?  -Bleach.  All zee way.    3. Poll, do you support Fansubs?  -No not really. :(  I don't like that static sound in the background.... XD    4. Poll, Bleach, One Piece, or History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi? Which one of these should overthrow Naruto on onemanga?  -BLEEEEEAAAAACH!  But. I don't know if that will happen anytime soon.  Probably not till Kishimoto wraps up the series.    5. There's a book that falls from the sky. It's a future issue of Shonen Jump that just so happens to have the last chapter of Naruto, Bleach and One Piece, and the epilogue. What do you do?  -I would treasure it foreverssssssssss.  And then i would call the news to tell them that a book from the future fell outta the sky. X3    6. Lastly, what Anime has the most fans.  -....  Probably Deathnote.  Even though most of it's fans aren't all psycho, it's just an anime that everyone really seems to love and respect you know?    See you. :)  |`|wic6ut7Qaa	This is the end? ;_;    1. They brought all of us crazy anime fans together to discuss relevant issues. And... stuff. :D    2. Yu Yu Hakusho, hands down. Ichigo and crew wish they were as cool as Yusuke and his posse. lawl    3. Sure. They're awesome, though I usually read manga instead.    4. If you know me, you can see this one coming a mile away...    *crickets chirp*    One Piece, and I really need to start reading Kenichi. I hear it's really good :D    5. I read One Piece first, then I read the end of Bleach, even though I haven't kept up with it since the soul society arc. Then I read the final chapter of Sasuke just to laugh at it.    6. Right now? Probably Sasuke. It started off alright (even though it has nothing on Hunter x Hunter), but now it's horribly overrated, and a lot of the fans are bonkers.    I blame 4kids and the cancellation of Toonami..|`|V5CLotETaa	Lol, haven't you said you were gonna quit before and then the pollveys came back! pwease pwease don't quit ... or at least go to 50 if you're really gonna quit!!!     1.

Poll, do you support Fansubs?  >>As long as the subs match the same timing as the sound and the sound matches the timing of the movement i'm all good with it!    4. Poll, Bleach, One Piece, or History's Strongest Disciple Kenichi? Which one of these should overthrow Naruto on onemanga?  >>Bleach is the only one I think could be capable of that! H.S.D Kenichi is a great anime but as a manga would get about as much popularity as Hajime no Ippo which doesn't quite have the potential to overthrow something still so popular as Naruto... One Piece might be able to but.. hmm.. who knows!    5. There's a book that falls from the sky. It's a future issue of Shonen Jump that just so happens to have the last chapter of Naruto, Bleach and One Piece, and the epilogue. What do you do?  >>I can't look... don't look... please don't look *opens looks but only reads one word then puts it in a glass case and locks it up in a safe that goes inside of another safe that goes inside of another safe that goes inside of another safe that goes into the secret compartment under my bed that has a combination... just so happens to be a safe* ^.^ phew    6. Lastly, what Anime has the most fans.  >>I'd say Bleach... Naruto anime is getting a lot of haters however the manga is still pretty popular but Bleach doesn't seem to have lost any fans!

Yes, I certainly do.    4. Bleach - it's my favorite of the three and is near Naruto on mangafox.    5. I read it then am disappointed because I won't be able to read those manga anymore.    6. Naruto, sadly. It's an all right anime/manga, but there are too many fans and it's become incredibly overrated. I wish that the unnoticed manga and anime would stop going unnoticed.  ^_^|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Don't make me laugh, Shock.    1. What did you guys like about these things?    -what things?    2.

What does this question mean?|`|CmJwqeJ5aa	ODDLY ENOUGH..I was on a date and thought of dead rabbits...because we were driving to a family friends house and a white rabbit ran out in front of us... oddly enough 4 days prior i spun my car after trying(and failing) to avoid a white rabbit when i was picking my mom up from work.....      AND My current bf i thought of dead rabbits once because my gram uses the term the rabbit is dead or she killed the rabbit to say someones pregnant because apparently an earlier form of pregnancy testing was giving urine to rabbits to drink and if the rabbit died then the woman was pregnant...    idk .she's old..i just believe what she tells me|`|IxGa7mnGaa	yes I once dated a dead rabbit.|`|uKpi4I5Oaa	No lol|`|2PTlXs9zaa	No, they were dead coyotes, he had a hundred tails in the back of his truck.

AA10916001	Uh.....she doesn't really talk like that in real life.      Listen to an interview of hers and then watch SOTL again and you will see what I mean.    She was born in Los Angeles, California and was there for almost all of her childhood....    I have never discerned any real accent in a television interview of her.|`|AA10368887	Not sure.

K5mh2rOKaa	i think it seems like u dont feel good singing , ur tone is too poor maybe u didnt do with all ur power (i hope so), in that way u do very good job, but please dont go to american idol singing in that way ull be rejected for sure, ud better prepare ur voice and dont be afraid to show all ur power because i think ure very very good     watch my vid i know i suck :P  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqPbQehf7...|`|evEJxv06aa	no and no your voice is fantastic you should be in american idol really because you have a voice of an thousand angels i am not joking i am telling the truth  if   you   audition for for a singing Compton you will win.|`|IYNDaQ2taa	You're really good =)|`|a19b1f4db1d77cea5f81a0935b914989aa	I think it sounds pretty good.  It sounds like were in a place where you couldn't sing very loud.  I would be interested in hearing you in a theater or some other big place where you could really give it some volume.    Your little vibrato at the end of the longer notes is especially nice.    Go somewhere where you can really make some sound.|`|fwyofOebaa	I think without voice lessons you're pretty good. Ask your mom! Don't be too shy!  Good luck!|`|0cJxF3qkaa	ya u sing pretty good ur just a little soft n kinda hard to hear!!|`|oMj8WAHFaa	again omg i am your number one fan bravo brava, encore, one thing though what you need to do is to get some instruments and some recording studio, choose your genre, i am a drumer i could help you out! Rock on!|`|g1155MhXaa	I think you are really good. You have a beautiful tone, but try to make your voice sound clearer and louder by eliminating the breathiness in your voice. Not too much though! Corrine has a nice control of that. I think you have a good future.                Good Luck!  (ps. it would help if you sang where people can see your face. it would be good practice for T.V!!)|`|nb8YG7Waaa	Your voice is sweet, and very in tune. I really like it. You would definitely benefit from singing lessons, of course, especially to help with your confidence. You have a great potential!! Good luck!|`|mQlkWTkTaa	i feel like ive already answered this question..haha but I think your good! The 1st one you sang "Like a Star" is better. But if you really want to audition for American Idol...I think you really need to work on your pitch. Some people are good, but just not good enough for that kind of competition. Start working you way up. If you're shy and get stage fright, american idol isnt for you...yet! You can start going to karaoke nights and stuff, that way it will help you break out of your shell! Then i bet you'll sound fantastic! But for now, your just ok. Not terrible!
OtvAUGv1aa	It sounds like you are either an alto or mezzo soprano, so I would stick with early jazz music - Etta James, Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday. Those will roll off your vocal chords with ease and should have a warm quality only someone with a lower voice can master. Unfortunately, there's not much "pop" music out there that is gonna be easily sung being that it's all warped by the studio where they record their albums.    Plus, you are still young, you don't want to sing "pop" at your age. Your voice is still growing - and will actually develop most between ages 18 and 24.     I teach voice and piano lessons and I usually don't do anything more than early jazz, SOME Broadway and a lot of classical music with young musicians. Once they're older, I introduce more popular things to sing - because that is when their voices are able to handle it.
OpBFc27iaa	You have the right idea...but you need to write it in a better format, more like a rap and not like essay, know what im sayin?    but overral, you got the right idea and are on the right track..stick to the real issues like this and not on money and ****, thats whats gunna make you stand out.    also, since you got the basics down, try changin up the words, get a better vocab, it will improve your work alot.|`|mBQQL0kCaa	talked about a million times|`|Qk3oflwPaa	that's a hit. spin it on a tight beat & you'll be commin correct. job well done. 2 thumbs up. keep up the good work.|`|nRXMVrVAaa	what?   it seems pretty harsh......................................  like i dont know i would need to hear someone actually singing it or something...|`|H4QXyYBDaa	try recording and editing it in a beat cuz right now im not sure about the beat, flow or the voice but lyrics seem nicew though... so u should write but with a beat and flow and something good with your voice

K9X0q7Whaa	Its commonly known amungst the comic reading community that gotham city residents and officals already have a thin line when it comes to contempt for thier own fair city due the mass crime wave and corruption.  However when Harvey Dent became district attorney and teamed with batman and commisonor gordan all that changed.  Crime bosses were being taken off the street, and even the powereful reprobates were reconsidering thier actions.  They gave the people hope that not all was lost for thier city, for thier home.    But when Harvey actions were called into question batman tried to lecture him about this...how the citizens always needed to see him as thier savior...thoir "white knight."  How if someone saw him even threatening or violateing a crooks civil rights out side of the justice system that all trust in the three of theem as well as thier accomplisments would be broken.  Which would include the cases against every criminal and deviant they locked up.  So when Harvey became two face and killed those people batman decided that since they couldnt tarnish his perfect reputation.  Ergo when harvey "died" at the end he took the blaim for the murders to keep thier work a success.  The criminals would stay in jail and to keep up appiances jim gordon would have to treat him as if he did murder them.  which would include hunting him.  Yes he is still a hero, the dark knight is just taking another chapter in his long history of comic crusadery.  Now he will be more like spiderman in the fact that not many will trust him and there will be a constant warrant out for his arrest.  and yes that is a storyline from the comics.  that explain it a bit?|`|x4OYJpSUaa	Did you skip the last 20 minutes of the film?|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Because Batman is not the heroe that they are going to turn to. They'll hunt him down.|`|Q6qBxKbAaa	I will explain why and also in movie Batman explain clear, from movie.  Batman The Dark Night. Batman say "You either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain. I can do those things because I'm not a hero, not like Deni. I killed those people. That's what I can be." George "No you are not." Batman "I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be." Batman say "You'll hunt me. You'll condemn me. Set the dogs on me. Because that's what needs to happen. Because sometimes the truth isn't good enough. Sometimes people deserve more. Sometimes people deserve to have their faith rewarded. Because I am the hero Gotham deserves, but not the one it needs right now. So you will hunt me, because I can take it. I am a silent guardian, a watchful protector. A dark knight."|`|MZFIJf1zaa	They don't want Batman's help anymore and they don't think of him as a hero. He's not a hero anymore because he took the blame of killing the people that Harvey Dent killed.|`|OtvAUGv1aa	Because they are trying to pretend that they no longer look to him for help - he has become the villain in order to protect Harvey. They do it more for appearances. I'm sure more will be explained once the third movie comes out.|`|lGg8AU1Yaa	he did it to give Harvey Dent aka 2 face a good name and blamed it on himself because he felt sorry for harvey dent losing mrs. dawson. thats why the Luitenut played along and by breaking the Bat signal.

But since Chinese Zodiac is a bit differently, I would say that their rule changes. So unless you believe that you're going to or not, I would think that that's your answer. But according to my studies, no. You're gonna be fine.

The vocalist has a very nice flow in his delivery|`|7B2s7maWaa	"Shitgaze" I don't believe I have heard that one yet.    I shall call them good.  That song was very cool and it sounds like their crowd agrees.  That won me over the fact that they can connect to their audience.  Thanks for sharing and posting Likegib. :]|`|yjSGVfdiaa	I call them "yo' mama"|`|wEpwWVhJaa	I had to click on the studio one too, the cymbal was drowning everything else out. Very cool. Great video.  Believe it or don't, like some of Snow Patrol's (very) early stuff|`|AA11518803	I missed the previous post with the studio version, but from what I could make out, I dug it. I'm a sucker for combining noisy guitar & harmony.

"Ebony and Ivory"- Eddie Murphy and Joe Piscopo as Stevie Wonder and Frank Sinatra was hillarious.    "Sarah Palin Rap"- This was just a huge hit/classic right away.    The skit when Richard Pryor and Chevy Chase were doing word assosiation. It was completly racist on both sides, but it was hillarious.    "Chippendales"- Chris Farley and Patrick Swayze    "Isn't that special?"- Dana Carvey as the Church Lady    "Buh-bye."- Total Bastard Airlines    "We are, two wild and crazy guys!"- Hillarious no matter how many times I watch it!
PMQWI1Ojaa	Sure did, we also used to slide some liverwurst in there and then it was called a "Dagwood".  I assume it was because the velveeta and the liverwurst were never thin sliced so the sandwich was huge.     Classy folks|`|nGxrvQavaa	Eww....

It makes people look sad and poor.  It is saying the wrong thing.|`|hZ9omSataa	i don't care about s.l.u.t.s, I care about trendy s.l.u.t.s    I think it looks stooopid|`|80t10xWGaa	only acceptable between the ages of 14 and 22, which leaves most of the world's population out of that window. There are certain instances where these shorts look absolutely ridiculous i.e: The Mall, The Movies, and the Theatre (yes, it's true, I went to see the play "Wicked" at the Louisville Centre for the Arts and a young girl was wearing these "Booty Shorts")     So to answer your question, these shorts are perfectly fine if you are within the age group and you are at an outdoor function such as the beach, tennis courts, parks and theme park.    Thank you.  Have a bootylicious day.|`|NLwfMSJWaa	lol  i saw a pair that said "kiss it"  it was kinda sad  and it was like 11 year olds wearing it  it send out the wrong message|`|3mJiPveSaa	No walking unpaid advertising here, but UNDER those, I think appropriate holiday themed underwear - like red "Happy V-Day" (Valentine's Day) or green "Feeling Lucky?" (St. Patrick's Day) - can be fun. ;)|`|xHcQSLiVaa	It is according to where you are wearing them.  I was teaching in a Catholic High School and I had a student who was having a birthday.  His mother brought his homeroom Chick-fil-a.  She danced through the school wearing her sweats with "juicy" written across her can.  Extremely inappropriate and embarrassing to her child.  they have a time and place.|`|efx1CpFVaa	Definitely, I think they're adorable.|`|9xnwKZ3yaa	Do you have a pair of sweats with DIVA acrossed the rump?|`|H4pqDG09aa	Not a fan-I don't think it looks classy in anyway.|`|jLhg1IJXaa	within reason, .. yes, cute.|`|exh2uAlEaa	at some point.... u juust get too old|`|cYFAo75Yaa	i wouldn't wear them to something formal, but to each his own...|`|AA11369490	i think theyre ok  but not the ones that say 'hottie' or something liek that on them|`|bHQpwVlXaa	Only if it says Diva in New York, other wise I can't stand seeing those things, I'd rather wear my zubas|`|YSzNTo4Haa	ghetto, i will never wear pants with writing on them its tacky .not even brand name unless  there sweats that say somthing cute and not on the butt.but jeans  no|`|VuhhcINOaa	I don't like them, and would not wear them myself. I don't think I need to know that someone thinks they're an "angel" or "princess" in the form of an advertisement on the seat of their pants. But maybe its just me.|`|aZefRFiWaa	I hate them they're annoying|`|iY9hyBA0aa	its like 'here, read my a**" not really the best message to send|`|tVoMXFDRaa	i always like when a girl has that on their sweats and i read it and then someone gets pissed and thinks im a perve...|`|AA10025824	I have a big problem with that.  Especially on young girls.|`|grifjdr0aa	18 and under....|`|8nm2psyKaa	if your under 25 then I think its ok but after that people need to grow up|`|hKVh1EIcaa	any type of logo on clothes sends out a bad message if the other person or people are in the mindframe of bashing the person who is wearing it
ci64gIZ8aa	I just watched it on DVD and I must say that I kind of liked this movie. Well, actually I liked just the ending. It was way better than in the first one, because it wasn't just a stupid prank to a friend (which by the way, no one sane person would do to anybody). This one also had ending, that I would never predict. But that's possibly just because I was waiting straight copy from the first one.    The acting was horrible, except for Scout Taylor-Compton. Killing scenes were stupid, especially the first one. The direction was so cheap-looking, that I almost puked. But because the ending was decent and the movie was somewhat entertaining, I give it 5/10.
uZQIUeyvaa	no hip hop is the whole culture while rap is a musical aspect of that culture. You wouldn't say flapper was a genre right, no swing was it's that same concept.|`|NzkPEKYgaa	Rapping is a part of hip hop.  In the words of KRS, hip hop is something you live, rapping is something you do.  Other parts of the hip hop movement include DJ-ing, breakdancing and grafitti.|`|ioNTTqKfaa	Hip hop refers to the culture, or the genre of music. If you are talking about the genre then it means the same thing as rap. Elitists like to say there is a difference to distinguish between good and bad artists but thats bull. It is all hip hop, even if it is crappy hip hop.|`|3nRfePaaaa	Hip-Hop is more than a genre, it's a culture.  Rapping is part of Hip-Hop.  (Rapping,DJ-ing,Breaking, and Graffiti.)

nbnd1dpQaa	Metallica have four instrumental songs, I don't know if you want to count the entire S&M Project though.    (Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth - Kill em All    The Call Of Ktulu - Ride the Lightning    Orion - Master of Puppets    Suicide & Redemption - Death Magnetic      Ecstasy of Gold doesn't really count because they did not write it, and they don't have it on any of their albums, it is composed by Ennio Morricone. Though, you'd think it was their song, since they've opened every concert with that song since the 80s.

QsQj8jO7aa	You need to do ear training. In my case, I can tune a guitar without a tuner and have it right on pitch. I don't even need a reference pitch. I know what the pitches sound like but it took me lots of ear training to learn. Practice singing the pattern of the open strings. E, A, D, G, B, E.   I'll edit this answer tomorrow and put in some good ear training exercises for you to work on. Remember that music is all in your ears, that is the most important thing for you to work on. You should also learn to read and study a little bit of harmony too.|`|JyxNA1o0aa	Same thing with a violin with me! 5 years and i could never tuneit! XD    Anyway, i can't tune a guitar for shyte either so, what i do is strum all the string together in a chord or whatever and if it sounds like musicy it's ok, if it sounds all twangy on some areas its kinda out of tune.So then you go back and strum each string and go from there....|`|cYtHoGaVaa	It's all about practice. Try tuning without a tuner, and then check how well you did.|`|vlIXsFmhaa	listen for the rotations. When you strum a note, you can hear it turn over. Tune until the turning slows to a stop

I have two!  Mine are 32 and 3! Thats why 32toes is often my screen name but Im using this for a while.  Anyway I love 32 because I have three kids, 10 toes each One of my kids is an angel who we lost to trisomy 13 :-(  but he has two extra toes, so there you have 32!  And 3 because he was my baby  3, born on the 3rd mont (March), exactly 3 months before my husband's birthday, which is June 4th, my son was March 4th! He was born at 3:22pm(also like his birthdate, 3(month and hour and 22 is 2plus 2 is 4, hence march 4th) and youve heard 3rd times a charm well, my first two were c-sections and my angel was a natural delivery, this was incredibly special to me because I shared that with only him. and actually he would be almost 3.    Funny how a simple, random question can produce a sentimental meaning, huh? Thanks for letting me share.|`|bb6f5c98e5ad6a19b9c7b09e398b2418aa	It is between 2 and 4.|`|80f8957313036f4f2509cf56af9cbb7aaa	1,320,573,634,832,452,356,235
hpdZDBVQaa	Bonniethon! How are you?    Um, that's hard. Innovative, I think Pete Rock. He's uses tons of obscure jazz samples and he re-birthed the slick for NYC.     Fave PR beat...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FB5UxsSjr...    I like what he did with Al Green and this song feels good driving down the West Side Highway at 2 am coming home from seeing my.    I'm good, can't complain baby girl. Are you snowed in over there too? Aww, that's good....make sure to name one Tam after me.|`|cMHSpGXWaa	just blaze i like how he flips classic into dope ish     jay-z you dont know|`|LsMlGCeoaa	Dr. Dre changed hip hop with NWA's gangsta rap, many tried to copy but none could match him at it...... The Chronic he made the G-Funk sound, again many tried to copy it but none could have the same success as he did.........Dre made Eminem which love it or hate it brought millions of new listeners who had never really listened to hip hop before........and The Chronic 2001 changed hip hop again.... I cant pick a favorite beat, but I'd say Deep Cover, Natural Born Killaz, In Da Club, and Dre Day are some of his best......|`|nAtBuBRhaa	I think either Large Professor, DJ Premier or Easy Mo Bee. All three of them are in my Top 10 as well.    Favorite Large Proffessor Beat: It Ain't Hard to Tell by Nas  Favorite DJ Premier Beat: Mass Appeal by Gangstarr  Favorite Easy Mo Bee Beat: Gimme the Loot by The Notorious B.I.G.    I would say some producers such as J Dilla, 9th Wonder, Black Milk, Kanye West, etc. But I don't think they compare with the 3 I listed above.|`|9ceRmqUAaa	Pharrell ok i love this beat i use to get high and sit and listen to this song right here snoops and pharrells lets get blowed|`|mZpCdihsaa	Timbo...easy.|`|bribxhsdaa	I woke up yesterday and thought it was the Apocalpyse...A pretty racist apocalypse. Turns out it was just snow >_>.    I think on method (Which is the main thing i think producers should be rated on...)    It's 9th Wonder. The Fruity Loop argument is a tired one...But there are producers who have MPC 4000/MV8 setups that can't produce tracks like 9th...    If you talk about weaving patterns of simple synths to make sharper melodies, Going the extra mile on EQ's on drums so they don't sound corny like most FL defaults(Although some of his Snare work has been kinda shocking. An area Pete Rock will always rule the roost)...9th is the man by a year and a day.    I think guys like Pete Rock, Primo, Dilla are all goats with regards to the quality of what they can make and the simplicity they add to it so you fans can't get lost in the beat. But in theory, A lot of them have similar methods .    But innovation can't be called by anyone who can be replicated...To put that into perspective...I think GREATNESS can be called, which a lot of the aforementioned producers have but a lot of greats like Dilla for example are being replicated fairly well i.e. Black Milk which you can't particularly say for 9th.    Favourite Beat - "Not Enough" - Little Brother    I'd give Madlib a close 2nd though.|`|xmdh8iY3aa	Rick Rubin. Who would have thought to merge rap with hard rock/heavy metal? The two genres were oil and water up until the mid 80's.    Favourite beats: Peter Piper, Paul Revere, Rock The Bells|`|Mfixq1oyaa	Premo-Royalty|`|3nRfePaaaa	for me its between Premo and Pete Rock.  Since Premo is my fav., i'll go with him.    Fav. beat : Nas Is Like|`|ioNTTqKfaa	RZA    fav. beat, hard to say there are so many of them.    C.R.E.A.M.  Tearz  Triumph  Gold  Iron Flag|`|3drMJB1maa	Pete Rock...Teddy Riley very close 2nd|`|o08LJ9Jwaa	Timbaland- Big pimpin     Dont hate....

hLdIO43Xaa	If you have a music teacher, a gymnastics coach, any "Guardian" for each talent, you NEED to ask them to direct you and keep a look out for competitions and such, since they'll be the ones with connections.  I'm good at art and piano and there are plenty of local competitions and contests that my teachers tell me about---your teachers are experts and will get to connected.    It depends on your age---I couldn't find any hints, but if you are a teen, you should definitely check out Miss Teen America   www.missteenamerica.com/    For Piano and Violin, there are lots of competitions local, regional, and international. If you have a piano  or violin teacher, you should ask them. If you don't have a teacher, its kind of a connotation that you aren't super serious about it.  Here's a directory for different competitions, music festivals, for piano and violin available:  http://www.afn.org/~afn39483/    Here's the site to a Talent Search for actors , actresses, models, musicians, voice-overs, and other performers!  http://www.hollywoodauditions.com/talent...    I hope I helped. Good luck!|`|YYOiYUDtaa	Ok the first thing you could do is try and audition for something like Britain's got talent (or the american version if you're american) they audition people with any talent. If it's singing you know you're really good at try the x-factor.   If these do not work, then try contacting an agency and they will guide you in the right path.   Good luck.

AwBVoWOaaa	Ok. So the film is a bit confusing. No, more like very confusing.    Sammy Jenkins was faking his amnesia and Lenny was right. But Lenny sort of twisted his own story and meshed it with Sammy's.    Sammy didn't have a wife (according to Teddy), Lenny's wife thought Lenny was faking his disease so she tested him when she needed her insulin shot and overdosed.    Lenny killed his wives attackers a long time ago.    What I don't get is how Lenny was capable of remembering his own story through Sammy, it could be all a lie for what we know, but that's how it ended.    "Now, where was I?"    Awesome film, one of my favorites. A truly masterpiece.|`|Vw2M1zXXaa	sammy and lenny don't have anything to do with each other.  Lenny is just the guy he decides to kill, long after he has actually killed his wife's real killer.  sammy is just a separate story.|`|woq2k4Pkaa	Very confusing film,because it moves backwards and repeat itself,reminds me of Groundhog Day    Any movie that has to be seen more than once to make sense isn't worth watching.Sure having a twist is fine but Memento's twist is more like a knot that couldn't be untied

I can see what they are trying to do with him, they know he can't skate and they are making him into the 'funny' one, but me for one cannot watch him!|`|6d10196c158f49dbb02649f8773591d0aa	I think he is odd looking however his personality shines through a lot plus the vt of his children was cute lol  I do think he should go but cant help but be entertained by him but definate not to win and be out soon prop week god forbid will be a Zimmer frame pmlrof|`|ZvxyqG3Paa	what   a    nasty    person    that   moorea   is .      like   everyone    else    we    all    have    an     opinion   .    and   i    dont     find    todd   one    bit     funny  ,      i    still    believe    when    he    went   down    the     tunnel    he    knew    what   he    was    doing .      he    needs    to    be    voted    off    now /   before   all   the    good    skaters    go  ,        how    people    can    waste    money    voting    for    someone    whos    got    no    chance    of     winning   d.o.i  .|`|zZ3Uxllfaa	i find him funny whip but i think its more to do with watching him as a kid in grange hill and tuckers luck then in easties , i didn't watch him in the Bill though , but not creepy i found that Jeremy smarmy edwards creepy  glad he's gone lol|`|gGZz2EGyaa	No you are not alone I have never liked Todd as an actor either, I do not know about creepy but no I am not keen on him.  He has a great fan following from Grange Hill and Eastenders, but I am one of the exceptions and I am not a fan.  He is hopeless on DOI and I think he should be voted out, if he gets into the skate off the judges will see to that.  Todd's skating just has not improved at all, he does well for a learner but he still seems stuck on just learnt!|`|AA11594429	I'm sure he is a nice guy, but I have to agree. I've had a problem with him and his acting since he left 'Grangehill'! I don't watch DOI but I saw his comedy 'effort' on youtube after hearing about it on the radio. If people want to vote for him then fine. I find him a bit fake, maybe because he has been in the business so long, that's his on screen persona.|`|AA10077992	Yep- looks like it's only you ! I think he's great !   (BTW how rude is Moorea)|`|0789e50a1396d5b6b9138ceaad0e64f5aa	I don't find him creepy at all H and think he is probably a nice bloke!  Nothing wrong with his acting and last week he did make me laugh but that is about as far as it goes.|`|aKhZNd7daa	As Tucker Jenkins in Grange Hill many moons ago H he was great and as PC Valentine in The Bill he played a good part and played it well BUT as for DOI there is just something 'not likable' about him although he's made me laugh - Maybe Micheal Underwood is right - he's hamming up his performance's just for the laugh and sympathy vote !!!
AA10077992	I thought so  - I don't like Michael much but I thought Donal should have gone|`|0789e50a1396d5b6b9138ceaad0e64f5aa	Michael was by far the more confident skater - Melinda couldn't even skate on her own so she should have gone!|`|6d10196c158f49dbb02649f8773591d0aa	Melinda she is smug Micheal more down to earth and admire him for trying again after breaking his ankle|`|3a9f3003abdd986d136bc7307c02868faa	Michael should have stayed, he was more confident on the ice, and the confidence was growing week after week once he got over the fear of breaking his ankle again.    I didn't think Melinda was good enough to win the skateoff, but then again no female has been voted off yet, looks like they are trying to get a female winner again.|`|aKhZNd7daa	Sorry H but I would have sent home Melinda - by know means was I voting for Micheal to win - lol I'm gunning for Donal who in all honesty should of been in the Skate Off - but as I don't actually get  on the phone and vote guess I ain't really got much of a say lol|`|SHeLdu8haa	Melinda|`|UlLpPuOTaa	Judging purely on the skate-off, I would have sent off Melinda. Although I wasn't a fan of Michael's efforts on the ice in general - I thought his performance was better.|`|lReSpTijaa	It should have been Melinda that got sent home, she did little or no skating on her own. I guess Michael may have got the boot as payback for selling his story to the papers|`|ZvxyqG3Paa	it    should    of    been    the  .  blow  up   doll .   melinda   that   went      not    michael  .       but    i    think    michael    started    getting    a    bit     cocky    and     actually     thought     he    was     going    to    win   ,|`|aGwjf2y4aa	i thought michael done much better and done more skating all melinda done was cling on to her partner|`|hTrqYiwJaa	Michael would probably would have gone next week anyhow.
SHeLdu8haa	Dunno...but I bet Todd won't be seen dead near a rink when this finishes.|`|cJad75leaa	Jessica has trained for another Dancing/Ice based programme and i think Ray has had some experience before|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	Chris Fountain|`|AA10077992	I bet they were glad to see the back of it  so hardly any!|`|UlLpPuOTaa	Quite a few of the younger ones I'd say whipass...ever waiting for the call for a DOI special...|`|6d10196c158f49dbb02649f8773591d0aa	Quiet a few as thwey carry on if good enough to the live tours the girl who was hear say Suzzana and also the gaynor Faye did the tour plus many more normal the ones who come first second and third carry it on.|`|aKhZNd7daa	I guess only those who have been on the Dancing on Ice Tour H - Chris Fountain, Suzanne, Bonnie, Faye etc

DE6TYIh2aa	if you wanna know everyone own  The Cullen Cars  Two of my three brothers are obsessedand I mean that in the literal, clinical sensewith automotive vehicles. This comes in very convenient when I need to know what kind of car one of my characters is driving. I simply call Jacob or Paul and ask, "What's the fastest and most powerful four-door sedan out there?" and then whichever one I'm speaking to will immediately rattle off a long, specific description of the car I want, including the price, the horsepower, the time it takes to get from zero to sixty, and any new body stylings that might be on the way. They will also probably email me a picture within minutes. (And the insane part is that if I ask the other brother the same question, he'll give me the exact same answer, though possibly a different picture.)    So, in honor of Paul and Jacob, I'm including the specific makes and models of the cars driven by the Cullens (and a link to an approximation), because I know it would kill them if someone thought my vampires were driving lesser cars.    [Edit: the cars featured on this page are those which are in the books (or at least as close to them as we can find); the cars in the movie may be different in many cases  we are aware of this but still have decided to feature only the cars that are mentioned in the books]  [Edit  2: SPOILER ALERT! As this page contains cars from other books in the saga besides Twilight, there are a few possible spoilers included.    First, though, Bella's truck, which I picked out all by myself (a 1953 Chevrolet Pickup Truck):      Chevy Pickup     Edward's Volvo, the silver S60R (and I've been assured that the "R" part is essential):      S60R Pic   S60R  2     Rosalie's BMW M3 convertible:      M3 Pic     Carlisle's Mercedes S55 AMG:      S55 AMG Pic   S55 AMG  2     Emmett's Jeep Wrangler (the closest I could find):      Jeep Wrangler   Wrangler  2     And, the car that got cut in the editing process. This is Edward's "special occasion" car, and the one he used to take Bella to the Prom. The Aston Martin V12 Vanquish: (Edit: although the Vanquish was cut from Twilight, it makes a special guest appearance in Breaking Dawn)      Vanquish Pic     ***Update*** 2007   Obviously, we needed to add at least two more cars to the list which were crucial in New Moon. Here are Jacob's Volkswagen Rabbit and Alice's Porsche 911 Turbo:      Jacob's Rabbit   Alice's Porsche     ***Update*** Edit: As I have been reminded in many (literally several hundred) emails, we never posted the motorcycles after New Moon. I apologize for the delay, but I suppose they are better late than never. So, here is Jacob and Bella's Harley Sprint and Honda motorcycles (and we also included Edward's Ducati which he purchased later):   Jacob's Harley   Bella's Honda   Edward's Ducati       ***Update*** August 2008   WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS! With the recent release of Breaking Dawn, it has once again become necessary to add some new cars. Here are two pictures and a video of the Mercedes S600 Guard (the "Guardian" in BD is a fictitious car which is one step up from the Guard).      Mercedes Guard   Mercedes Guard Mercedes Guard on Google Video  (shows the security against  bullets, explosions, poisonous gas, etc.)      And, of course, Bella's 'after' car, a Ferrari F430:      Ferrari   Ferrari  2   Ferrari  3   Ferrari  4|`|AA12270666	he has a silver volvo!

i0B5Q2SKaa	well seven and six have a long history since 7 and 6 are right by each other every day they fight a lot they fight about who will get to grow to 100 or why 9 likes 10 or if 3 is jealous that 4 is older but seven always seemed to be the winner he said i will grow to be 100 because i'm older or bigger. 9 likes 10 because 10 is a older number and has two digits. and that 3 will always be jealous because 4 rhymes with tour and that tours are fun at arcades but six always fought back he said that that the older u are the sooner u will die and 9 likes ten because 8 is the only other choice and who would pick 8 and 3 is not jealous because 3 is way closer to number 1  but one day 7 agreed that 9 would never pick 8 so 7 took him......for dinner that day six was afraid of seven and every time someone would count to ten it would be 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 10 THE END|`|vrGjDDmzaa	because six watched seven ride a unicycle down a canal wearing a clown suit and aztec mask while machine gunning a monkey who was eating a dog dipped in ranch dressing. seven saw that six was watching and smiled evilly and then hopped off the unicycle, walked across the canal, plant a grenade under the monkey and then sprout wings and fly away, running over superman in the process.|`|PqlVHDnGaa	Because 7 8 9!  Actually, 7 dined on 9 for brunch yesterday, with a lemon butter sauce!|`|M0Rlgtyxaa	because seven stabbed 9 while wearing an evil clown mask and wants revenge on six. So seven was chasing six in a room full of mirrors. and six finally got out but seven stayed in there because it couldnt find its way out. when six finally caught a glimpse of seven running across the sewer, 7 was in a transformer suit and holding a knife ready to kill six. So six kept running and went into a cave where a bunch of bats were hiding. and he killed all the bats and covered himself with them so seven would just think it was a pile of dead bats and never expect it to be 6 hiding under them.  so 7 picked up a dead bat and ate it and thought it was disgusting and left the cave. and it is still on the loose, trying to find a way to kill 6 and today, 7 is hunting in the home of 6 right between 7 and 8. But still could never find 6. so today, 7 is still on the loose searching for 6 and looking for some way to kill him....THE END!    oh yah! i forgot. before all this happened, right after 7 stabbed 9, 7 8 9. so 7 stabbed 9 then 8 9.|`|ZCecrXjcaa	because seven ate nine...|`|VSfiigz3aa	because seven ate nine.  ha ha  get it seven eight nine|`|xXyy51Efaa	Because 7 was bigger than six, and six was a scared little baby.|`|RBGc1Hytaa	Because seven slept will all of six's friends then six never saw them again.|`|LBlqBHaGaa	Because the number seven ate the nine because seven is so big and buff and has really sharp teeth.

But if I want to see it I will see it no matter what.|`|XE2ejJ4waa	My choices are no at all affected by the critics. I see movies that look interesting to me. I don't really care what the critics say. Most of the time when people rave about movies and say "oh my god you have to see this it was amazing" I end up not liking the movie. (movies that most people like I end up not liking).    I prefer watching movies in the theater , I like it a lot better than watching movies at home. The screen is bigger, the sound is better and it gives to the whole movie watching experience. Depending on how much I want to see the movie depends on how much I will pay to see it.|`|AwBVoWOaaa	I know if I will watch a movie based on the trailer, but yes, if it's panned by critics, then I won't go to the movies and watch it. I'll wait and rent. Also if it's LOVED by critics, to me it'll probably be pretentious and boring.    This does not mean that it has to have GREAT reviews, just acceptable. Like C+ or 5.5 out of 10.    However, if it's a chick flick or a cheesy action film with big explosions, I'll probably watch no matter what.|`|r9lfDeRmaa	I don't depend on the critics for anything. I honestly just watch every movie I think looks good, and even some that look bad just so I can say I saw them.     However with that said I tend to like movies the critics hate. The ones that get 2 thumbs down or one star. Don't get me wrong I'm not saying I don't like ANY critics approved movies.

ZyGyDLsDaa	It sounds like "Bugsy Malone" (1976), which stars Jodie Foster and Scott Baio. Only, their guns shoot whipped cream. The film is set in the Roaring Twenties, with a cast of children.     IMDb review:  This is a very cute and enjoyable movie, quite possibly the only one in a very small sub-genre in the genre of gangster films: a musical gangster movie cast entirely with children (16 and under). The cast is notable principally by the presence of Jodie Foster (as a side note, this was released the same year as "Taxi Driver"!) and Scott Baio. The musical score was done by Paul Wiliams, who was nominated for an Oscar for his efforts here; and, the costumes are quite nice.    Here's the movie trailer and a musical number:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOrgDbldc...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_tKdAu7Fn...

x7Nadfjtaa	In episode 3: the very beginning when they get their teams    Then the chuin exams start on episode 20, but you dont see hinata until 23. Thats when all the new genin (from episode 3) show up in the same room, and they meet kabuto.  In 24 they take the test and hinata is sitting right beside naruto as everyone else attempts to cheat (lol, this part is funny)   In 25 they recive the 10th question as sakura talks over with herself about whether or not she should drop out. THen naruto raises his hand and you know the rest, with some hinata in it cause she's right beside him.  27: all the passing ones are lined up outside the forest of death.  No hinata until 34, when her team finds gaara and how he just killed an entire team. In that same episode they make it to the goal.  38: all the surviving ones are told about the prelim. rounds.   All up until 46 all the others are fighting for prelim and then neji and hinata are up.  For 46 and 47 neji and hinata fight and you can get alot of clips from there.  there is only some short hinata clips up until 79. On 80, it is the hokage's funeral, and she is shown a couple times there with their flashbacks with the 3rd hokage.     THen it goes on and ond with the sasuke arc until 148-151, when naruto goes along with kiba, hinata, and shino to find the bikouchuu she faints alot and during their stay, naruto finds this "AMAZING beautiful girl" near the waterfall and that is  hinata, but naruto doesnt know that.    159 starts with kiba running through a field with akamaru, and hinata nad naruto having a picnic. The mission is for naruto, kiba, and hinata going to the stone country for the bounty hunter. it ends at 160.    175-176 kiba hinata and naruto set off to search for "treasure". They travel together and find a cave, where the treasure should be. turns out someone is chasing them, and uses a speical tecnique that allows them to be exactly like the target.  This should be rather interesting at the end because the real hinata thinks that the real naruto is a fake.    184 when akamaru goes crazy with something, at the beggining when their team is training, akamaru starts acting wierd. that's the only thing with hinata there.     185 with the onbaa just a few short clips of hinata fainting when she sees the onbaa.    197-201 an old man who was naruto's friend who treated him to ramen often. turns out he is planning for the destruction of konoha. So the "konoha 11" (all the genin, except sasuke, of course) gather up and try to track, unveil, and dismantle the 200 explosive notes all across konoha.     And that's about it in the first part of naruto. you shouldnt put any shippuuden in there because she looks so much different.|`|64Lgwm2faa	shes really barley even there but in shippuden she goes on missions alot more because she can use byalkugan.|`|F60JZOU3aa	some of the early ones when they had their one on one fights in the ring (stadium),hinata against negie,|`|Mdfm7KAyaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHg5SJYRH...

cLW7vFUGaa	=D That's so cool. I respect you for dedicating yourself to something like that just for the heck of it. Knowing random anime trivia is always a fun idea. I've memorized several obscure quotes and Japanese theme songs, myself. It's great! And I'm sure, with all the Ouran fans out there, you'll probably find a use for it - if for nothing more than showing off - at a convention somewhere. Good luck!    Since the discrepancies probably arise from the multiple wording choices offered by subs (I guess there's not really one CORRECT way to translate; personal style of the subbers could show through), it might be best to cite the words from the English dub - since there's definitely only one of them and everyone would know it. So, transcribed from the first episode and checked multiple times:    "Only those with excellent social standing and those from filthy rich families are lucky enough to spend their time here at the elite private school, Ouran Academy. The Ouran Host Club is where the school's handsomest boys with too much time on their hands entertain young ladies who also have way too much time on their hands. Just think of it as Ouran Academy's elegant playground for the super rich and beautiful."

Your sister is a genius if she understands puns at 10 years old; its a pretty complex idea because many children cannot get past the literal.|`|d5T1hINgaa	unless someone finds it offensive..... it sounds ok|`|yut7x1b9aa	she's just 10. give her some credit.|`|Xi20QZfMaa	dude yes it is normal   she is just a kid that likes to joke   and that's okay   so don't get scared it is totally normal|`|xmdM9Gp6aa	cats usually land on their feet, thus comes the phrase cats have 9 lives. But sometimes the cat will fall and it might break his/her neck    DON'T THROW A CAT OUT THE WINDOW  p.s. i think its ok to tell her|`|uzmcXWSVaa	Yeah nothing wrong With That:)|`|S1yS9dKPaa	I think it is ok. I think she is just trying to make her own jokes. I don't think she is asking because she is thinking about doing it. My sister did the same thing when she was young. She would say "Why did the car get a flat tire... Because it ran over a porcupine". I wouldn't worry.|`|dTJtS5rAaa	Honestly, it's just one of those times when a kid wants to be funny because they think it will rocket them into a higher popularity score.  When in actuality, the person isn't all that funny but is still credited with the fact of trying to be.    It's just one of those things that we used to, and still do, to try to get attention or to show off.    You shouldn't worry about it to much.  It's okay... she is just trying to express herself.    The joke isn't bad, but let her know when it has gone too far.    Such as constant repetition or adding to the joke.    hope that helps!|`|pKnd0jJwaa	ooooooo noooooooo DEFINATELY not  ok! children as young as that should be strictly limited to knock knock jokes!  wtf? grow up|`|1AZAmuvgaa	sure i guess it isnt a bad thing to say|`|LTFXZcE7aa	Theres nothing wrong here
230NbPVUaa	I think it's a good storyline, definatly something that is serious and should be addressed. But it is really aggrivating as a parent to watch.. my husband was screaming at the TV when she would just stare at the monitor|`|a1b7363978e397f1d4527a8de30ab150aa	I think it is great that General Hospital is using a character to address a very real illness that affects a good number of mothers.  I like how she tries to hide it to, because that is also very real of what mothers do- they feel guilty and try to hide their feelings, when what they really need to do is talk about it.  I only hope that this storyline moves a little faster now.|`|ppE0GtkIaa	I absolutely HATE Robin and I wish the writers would write her off the show and for the PPD, she is a lousy actor and what mother would drive her newborn baby in a snowstorm, why didn't she call a ambulance and she is suppose to be a DR...lmao She doesn't deserve to play a mother on that show nor a DR, i wouldn't trust her with my life.  She is a real B*TCH, all she does is whine, blame, she is a snob, yelling, accusing and Patrick needs to divorce her and take Emma (if she is alive) and Robin needs to be locked up for life...lmao|`|NEfMSYjXaa	I love the character Robin... But I am so sick of the postpartum depression storyline.. I am glad that they did the storyline, but its about time to get over it.. Robin is being annoying and i'm sick to death to watch when she is on anymore.. I really wish they would hurry up and get it over with already.....|`|Nwc5h354aa	Im six months pregnant and it really has me thinking and hoping that i do not get that way when i give birth. Because just like her i was very excited to get pregnant and be pregnant.|`|SqNPj54Kaa	If you ever knew someone who had, or studied PPD, you would know that this story is one of the best ever presented and is being acted out spectacularly by all the cast, especially Kimberly.|`|M1ymLE9Paa	I think she's doing a good job protraying someone w/PPD.  But I'm not really enjoying the storyline.  I wish they would just let Robin bond w/her baby and be happy already.|`|Xgn57WGfaa	I think they should speed this story up and not drag it on for so long, let Robin enjoy her new life with her husband and daughter.|`|RogGEdyoaa	I would rather she was happy as pie since she worked hard to get that baby in the first place.........|`|7XM4QJiuaa	I like it but I just hope she doesn't hurt Emma.|`|msUIsv8maa	I think its gone on way to long let her have a normal life shes wanted a baby so much and now all this .Yuk|`|96jKYH8Uaa	it is so real and i like it|`|nZian6traa	i think it is sad to see her like that but it gives the story line a twist|`|UY3zl9dFaa	I also think it's good that they're dealing with the issue. But I also hope that she starts to face up to it and gets some therapy soon.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	It is sad but it does happen to women and it is rarely talked about. This has the opportunity to be one of those real stories that help people.|`|b2f5cc892d9a2ff6d43172b4bb022096aa	I think it is excellent the writers are addressing this issue.  I only wish they had moved the story along, so that it had become recognized and more dealt with, before all this major virus- crisis story line started.   Now it's kind of breaking up up the momentum they had going.|`|nrqWwQBXaa	i dont like it at all she needs to have a story line where she is a good mom?
Y5jv0ybFaa	Yes..after what Jessica said to Natalie that it was "Jessica" that wanted Tess to kill her....I'd be trying to protect the girls too.|`|gxl6oBpJaa	Well what would you do if someone tried to blow you up!? Yes, I think she had every right to go off on her. Jessica is a big baby.|`|ppE0GtkIaa	no, natalie needs to shut her mouth and mind her own business. Jessica is not the one who is sick, its Tess and Bess who have taken over Jessica's body and mind. I wish the writers would write Natalie off the show for good. She is always whining, screaming and etc.|`|b2f5cc892d9a2ff6d43172b4bb022096aa	Natalie was obnoxious to Jessica about her girls,  but really has Vickie shown Natalie any concern over being drugged, dragged down into the downstairs room, etc etc. Maybe suggested therapy for her recurring nightmares,  anything,  No!  So, I would say Natalie has some  heap of anger and hostility and no outlet or support ,,,maybe this is the best she can do in this situation.|`|nrqWwQBXaa	yes she had every right to say what she did. jessica needs to leave for a while. she is not the one that has been there for her kids. her oldest daughter was afraid to see her?|`|XRPtuwoTaa	NO!  Natalie has pulled her share of things, especially when she 1st came to Llanview, so she of all people playing the con artist needs to be set straight by Vicki & Clint|`|RogGEdyoaa	Yes, I am glad Natalie gave her  a piece of her mind. I do not trust Jesscia.............|`|7XM4QJiuaa	Partially - Nat is right that Jess always gets her way and Viki always makes excuses for her. But Jess can raise her children on her own and is probably a better mother than Nat could be.|`|UY3zl9dFaa	Natalie is and always has been jealous of Jess. First, because she was raised by Viki and Clint and now because she's getting more of Viki's attention. She needs to stop whining, grow up and get on with her own life. She has a good life and a man who loves her. She should put her jealousy and anger aside and give Jess a chance to heal before she has it out with her. Otherwise, she'll just turn her family against her.|`|AA12336927	Natalie is a self-righteous twit. Did she have a right to go off on her though yes. She needs to get the hell over it tho. Look at all Nat has done to Jess over the years AND right from the start. If you recall, Natalie hooked up with Jess' then boyfriend ( was it Lyndsey's son?) and then Christian. Then has the nerve to help Jarred TRY to pull off the scam of the century   Natalie needs to get over herself and move away, far far away  As a matter of fact, all the Buchanan's are a bunch of scheming liars and hypocrites. They didn't like what Jarred and Natalie did, but they are sure all on board with not telling David of his true parentage|`|AA12390047	Yes.  Nat had every right.  Jessica intentionally let "tess" out to kill Natalie and Jared.  And Nat is doing a good job taking care of Jessie's kids.  She calls a spade a spade.  More power to her.  Jessie is a wimp and always will be because Viki is around to always protect her and baby her.  That girl is in her late 20's or early 30's and still can't stand on her own two feet and take responsibility for her life and make a home for her daughter by herself.  That's irresponsible.  She should be in her own home with a job and she can hire someone to take care of Bree.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	A little, she should have been a bit more sensitive about things but I get where she is coming from too!
RVABrMeSaa	Amanda wants JR so she will play him as the daddy. I think it is either David's or Jake's. What a battle awaits! Maybe like OLTL(Nat and Jes) she'll have triplets one for each.|`|UY3zl9dFaa	I think that she just doesn't want to deal with the possibility that it's David's. I can't figure out what David's game is. I was surprised that he told JR that the baby could be his.|`|AA12336927	I told everyone in the beginning that it would either be David's or Jake's. I seriously think David will try to blackmail Amanda in some way. So he can raise a Martin. But really, there are so many twists that this one can take. I LOVE it|`|b2f5cc892d9a2ff6d43172b4bb022096aa	It looks like Amanda is already playing like JR is the Baby Daddy.  She told him today she had decided to keep "their" baby, and he responded with a look of joy !   And Earlier,  JR had told his father that Amanda was pregnant with His baby,,,,,,  David is a creepy sneak, and looking for a way to use everything to his advantage.|`|fab4d863aae6c11ee1163077586edcdaaa	I think it's because JR hates David's guts, and he'll start getting sick thinking about Amanda sleeping with him AND David at the same time.  Then he'll start getting suspicious of why David was sleeping with both Amanda and Crystal, while making Crystal think he's "hopelessly devoted to" her!  And she's even more scared that he'll start questioning to the point to where he'll put two and two together and realize that David put her up to messing with JR in the first place.  Once that happens ...    Amanda really likes JR ... she doesn't love him, but he's probably one of the only persons in Pine Valley who's never really judged her, and who will probably always be there for her.  She's ashamed at her part in what happened to him, and she doesn't want to see a look of contempt in JR's eyes at finding out everything she did.    Ding Dong David has his nose in everything in Pine Valley.  He needs to get together with evil "Doctor" Sinclair ... they'd be the perfect "Pine Valley Horror Couple"!  He gets nosy about anybody who he knows is keeping a secret, and he's already figured out how to use Amanda's secret against her.|`|AA12390047	Amanda is kind of a golddigger and JR is loaded.  She's trying to convince herself he's the Dad, and David knows it COULD be him so he's going to hang around and find out if he's the Dad. Amanda knows what David is like and she'd rather have JR be the father.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	The baby is David's it was revealed in the new issue of SOD. She wants it to be JR's so maybe he can get his life back on track, have something else to live for and straighten up for.|`|Qe9y6MnTaa	Cause maybe she wants to trick herself into believing that the baby is Jr's, and not David's. Seriously, how would you feel if you were having David's baby...so I think that's why she didn't tell him...
1EyRZm4Faa	Yup http://www.erowid.org/plants/nutmeg/nutm... Though You have to eat A lot, and it tastes horrible.|`|uKpi4I5Oaa	maybe....|`|0eArONZraa	hell naww she prolly trying to be cool, lolol try purple THAT shyt will actually get u high|`|b1d94518579dc9e27a499adab10f47e4aa	Yeah, that stuff will make you trip balls.|`|jnfLQlvXaa	i dont think so...|`|LoXvNBEmaa	yes you actually can  you have to have 6 whole nutmegs though   i crushed them up and made tea with them  they make you feel like you would after you smoke weed    it works but it tastes horrible, especially since you have to have so much to feel an effect|`|AN98KWr3aa	No, or else it wouldn't be commercially produced as baking ingredients. Nutmeg has no chemical properties to get you high.|`|5Exmtmhpaa	Oh, that explains why I was trippin' balls the last time I made cookies.    Darn nutmeg.|`|QfSlE0Tsaa	no-to have hallucinations the product must contain a hallucinogen which nutmeg does not|`|Z69OX0Gxaa	no, your friend is just trying to act gangster|`|0ljM5Ye7aa	I dunno lets try!!!!!|`|d33ff6b12876ab19368e1b44c245857caa	my boyfriend and i were talking about this after reading this question. He says that its possible but says that anything that makes you hallucinate can poison you...but hey we aren't Dr.'s...|`|7y7t04Vsaa	Yes, nutmeg is a hallucinogenic. But it must not be very good since they can sell it in the supermarket and no one tries to get high on it.    Also you can boil a lot of poppyseeds (like a cup of them) and make tea of it and if you can stand the flavor to drink it, it will sort of smack you up like opium.|`|i3S10DUqaa	I don't know, but I can get high on looking at colors... and they don't even have to be vivid colors... it feels like you're drinking it in with your eyes.  And no, I'm not high on anything else when it happens, I'm just a little crazy, that's all.  ^.^

Klw3Ke3Haa	Ok, can I have BA anyways that way you won't waste your points for nothing.
MK5Ddtiiaa	I am super excited. I think its a funny show. Chuck is a great show and NBC is lucky to have it so their ratings are not so low.
5ZGT2F98aa	When you are sitting and feel a strong emotion happy or sad or in between write down what you are thinking about most songs come form emotions artist feel and things the delt with never force yourself to write a song it will not turn out as nicely as if you wrote it while you were in a emotional mood|`|3Bk0xbeUaa	1 definately get a notebook full of ideas  2 dont force your song to rhyme everytime (even if the rhyme works on paper it might sound like crap when you sing it)  3 keep it simple and use common everyday language (no one will be impressed by your thesarus skills)  4 post your rough copies on yahoo answers for advice (you will have rough copies... no song is perfect the first time through)|`|zfrPmiFtaa	Get a notebook, or a bunch of paper if you want, and write out some ideas of what the song should be about. Write down some words that can be used and that rhyme with other words too. Play around for a while and see what you get. It could take an hour,a day,or even a week or two,but it's worth it.    Good Luck~
Klw3Ke3Haa	Yes, you can.
J30kfJpQaa	Yeah, probably.
4V0cIPQoaa	Hey. The key is to get your singing out there and get as many opinions as you can on it. Try sharing what you've recorded on a talent site. Theres one that I'm on, talenttrove, thats pretty good for that sort of thing. Once you have feedback you know what you have to work on and you can take steps from there. Good luck.
KKXNqpTiaa	Drinking stuff won't make you sound better at all. Especially dairy drinks/foods, cold drinks, soft drinks, alcohol and cigarettess. They all stiffen the throat and create mucus and flem which makes it harder to sing. They tend to make you strain more while singing and as a result you wreck your vocal cords. The only way you can make your voice better is by warming up your voice and practicing songs your voice can reach comfortably. Then slowly expanding your range by choosing harder songs. To make your throat realaxed during this is to drink Earl grey tea with 2 teaspoons of honey and a dash of lemon. NO MILK! Drink slowly to relax your voice and it will be easier to sing. It wont make you better at singing, just assist you in singing.  Goodluck!|`|efwvtzitaa	warm lemon+honey water|`|IVklSxM1aa	magic water.|`|sIfaVQXEaa	TEA--WITH ALITTLE BIT OF HONEY|`|g1155MhXaa	Dont drink juice,milk,or soda. It has sugar in it and coats your throat and alters your sound. A nice cold glass of water is the way to go.
zzO6Qalsaa	No, what you need to do is a little trouble shooting.1-make sure audio / video cables are correctly  connected.2- make sure correct channel is on for viewing(channel 3)3-Make sure rf out setting is correct. 4- look at remote, there is an audio button usually on extreme left bottom of remote press it  to see if was ACCIDENTALLY turned off-5hold set up button for 3 seconds and see if that works .Finally if all else fails, turn off tv and start set-up all over again. Hope that helps...............

0oBLUIGfaa	I love Lily Allen's music no matter what.  I also like The Fear and 22.  I think this album was a little more overdone than her last. But I was only able to listen to most of her upcoming album's songs because like 80% of it was leaked on the Internet so...    (:|`|AA11370204	That is a beautiful song and Lily Allen is an excellent singer and Pretty!|`|k6uRrQ9uaa	I personally like He Wasn't There (I think it's the last one on her album)    despise all the weird things she's done, I can forgive her after listening to this album. =)|`|RtG5Iarbaa	I've only heard Smile before, but when I heard The Fear it changed my opinion of her, musically. I really enjoy her voice actually, though in that song it's a bit too hidden under music.|`|wzkCSmF1aa	maybe i just dont understand it, and maybe the fear is a sarcastic song, but i think the fear's lyrics are very simple and stupid and materialistic.  "i want to be rich and have lots of money.  I dont care about clever i dont care about funny.I   want loads of clothes  And fuckloads of diamonds  I heard people die while they're trying to find them"  thats kinda stupid to me.  i like alright, still a lot better than her new stuff.      edit-  okay thanks for explaining, cause when i first heard it i was a lil pissed cause ithought she was better than that.|`|HtHFHfDKaa	I don't mind people following their dreams but she is just plain selfish she wants everything no matter who gets hurt. If you'd listen to the song more carefully you would know that. But the background pics are cool.|`|ZXjWQMnqaa	Lily Allen is awesome! I love her attitude. lol    I've only heard "The Fear" though. I'm just waiting for the album to release before hearing any more of her new songs. But I think "The Fear" is a great song!

bZGknHPFaa	get a kyser quick change capo. i think they're still like 19.95 at guitar center, but it's worth it and it's the only one you'll need. easy to switch it from the headstock to the fretboard, doesn't compromise tone or anything, and it's not very big. you can also get it in different colors.  it's the only capo i use.

RANDY RHOADS- CRAZY TRAIN|`|jKbCWwR3aa	I'd have to say it's a close call between Randy Rhoads and Jimi Hendrix, they were both amazing at how they played guitar.

Crazy Train and All Along the Watchtower.|`|ty3nnq2uaa	err....  i think one guy is mistaking anoushka shanker for a guitar player  she plays a sitar not a guitar    the best ever is Jimi Hendrix no question   though my personal best ever is dimebag darrell(cowboys,floods,im broken,walk endless)  but i still accept it that jimi is best ever like it or not    since both are RIP presently i would say  my personal best-Herman Li(TTFAF,soldiers of wasteland)  He is god  no one can play that fast   if thay can why dont they??  everybody likes fast solos      but i believe technically the best nowadays should go to either]  Eddie Van Halen  Steve Vai  Joe Satriani    other awesome guitarists  john frusciante  john mayer  kirk hammett  john petrucci  yngwie malmsteen      PS why so many j's and john's up there      maybe i should change my name to john :-)|`|7lDSkGLTaa	Jimmy Page.????|`|HMIMDysTaa	Razor you know that dave mustaine and james wrote ride the lightning not kirk|`|7xHJJ7Xraa	Its between Jimmy Page and Jimi Hendrix both are incredible guitarists|`|ecL0ZbfCaa	Living : Jimmy Page 'Achilles Last Stand'    My overall favourite is Jimi Hendrix, favourite track: 'Spanish Castle Magic'.|`|qh9Pa1tVaa	Jeff Beck  Roy Buchanan  Pat Metheny|`|Z5mmaFK0aa	There is no "Best" guitarist in the world that is based on opinion and personal preference.

I don't have a favorite song by them, they're all so good  the reason he's the best is because he had a whole vision for led.  He wrote all the songs, and he even helped produce some  also he's better than hendrix cause he was around a lot longer and got a lot more stuff done. he also created metal. that's what they called metal back then. the definition for metal has changed a ton though.|`|1vCoaf08aa	Jason Becker    Amazing, check him out, sadly, he has ALS now.|`|Zxl8oyIraa	KIRK HAMMETT!!

MXtpR1lAaa	Sergio? It's O.K just be the best flute player you can be, and Ms. Taylor will realize that you deserve first chair.|`|Po4Lljjwaa	So, did you only try-out because you wanted to brag about being 1st Chair?  Probably not.  If you're good enough to make 2nd Chair then you must have passion for the flute, right?  Play 2nd Chair!  You can't always start at the top.  You have to earn it.     I honestly don't know what City Honor Band is... but I was in band at school for 9 years.  When I was in high school, we had the opportunity to challenge the "higher" Chairs.  If you beat them in the "play-off" (judged by the teacher/conductor) you were able to bump them down a Chair and take their place.  Perhaps you'll be able to move up if you feel you derserve it more than the person in 1st.|`|HE558QgXaa	Don't feel bad about it. I'm like second to last chair in our high school band. Second chair is really good. Trust me. Playing the flute is very difficult. It's hard to adjust your mouth to make the tone clear. I would know. I've been playing it since the fourth grade. But second chair is just as important as first. And remember, no matter how awesome you are, there's always someone out there that's better than you. But that's the one thing that makes us work harder. So please, don't feel bad. You did way better than I did. And I'm sure that you're awesome :)|`|18a2aed6f83bc9f939d46ee795f8306eaa	Ahahaha I know how depressed you are but 2nd chair is still good isn't it? I mean no matter how much you tried, maybe the people that saw you didn't think you were worthy of the 1st but still the 2nd is still a good place. Don't quit. Keep trying and maybe if the person who got 1st chair sucks, you might be 1st. Doesn't matter.

I have always hated being the precious good boy one in my family, so I have started to be the opposite, the non-conformist, opinionated jerk.    You have to stop thinking about the consequences, what happens happens.  If your afraid, then you won't get very far in life, ya?|`|10f326a8d361451c48ca6d61e9c457e0aa	Keep it short, and speak the truth.  Don't argue with BS and delusions.  It takes time to change people's perception of you.  It also takes time to learn to not give a darn.  Forward.|`|nXUV9lH1aa	AH I KNOW.  i want to start over where nobody knows me.|`|lm2ByrhHaa	First of all, the racist loser who posted his answer first, should go f*** himself. I rated him thumbsdown, so I guess I'm just a naive little white girl and a dumbass.      To the question above, I had the same problem for the better half of my life. I never had friends and I kept to myself at all times. I'm not that way anymore because now I have a way to express myself in a way that I didnt know would be possible. I learned to play the guitar and sing, and now I am out of my shell. I have new patterns now. I write music to what my feelings are based on at the moment and then I sing them to an audience.  My remedy is a little extreme, I mean, jumping from total recluse to a performing musician, is dramatic, but it worked for me.  What I think you need, is some way to express the way you feel, and think. Your mind can become a trap, you can end up locked inside it forever if you allow yourself to get that far. My advice would be to pick a hobby, or learn a fresh talent. Music, my cure, is an eye opener for both yourself, and for the people around you. Other arts, painting, writing, drawing, singing, sculpting...the list goes on and on, are something you should try. Find something that works for you.|`|h00bqU7baa	Just go up and talk thats how you will make it far in life.

de3ENQdNaa	Here's the quote from the Wikipedia page, and I fully believe this to be accurate as I've never heard any other name.    " It is unclear if Newman is his first or last name, but it's generally believed it is his last name, as he is referred to as 'Mr. Newman' by the Judge in The Ticket. Aside from this, only the name Newman is ever used in reference to him."|`|44SM4m6xaa	Found this on another site:    Newman does in fact have a first name it is Francis. It is theorized he was named after privateer Francis Drake who first explored the Pacific Northwest, because Newman comes from a family of avid tree climbers from Portland, Oregon as stated in the episode entitled "The Reverse Peephole"|`|ygmlqaQPaa	Those are the questions that even the ones closest to him can't answer.|`|uDxPOVLhaa	i think his first name is paul

ae66b1407392b526977b195515f98f66aa	Honestly, I think the best way to deal with the depression is to remind yourself of how trivial the thing really is. The badge itself serves no purpose to me. Some think that it helps identify people with great answers from others, but I've come across A LOT of awesome answers by people with a 7% best answer rate. The fact that it gets lost and gained and lost again by a lot of users makes it more fickle to me and turns Y!A into more of a battle ground than cool place to get your questions answered.    Listen: You have a kick @ss avatar and are level 4. So what if you don't have a T.C badge, those things alone make you a force to be reckoned with.    edit- hah, very spiffy indeed. The hair is to die for :D. No sweat, my lips are sealed.|`|7XnLQTWHaa	All you have to do is work really hard to get it back,to get it back just come to your favorite section everyday and keep asking and answering question in that section.|`|UcaxDuLqaa	I don't know what I'm even doing with one...!!

I had one awhile back, it lasted a few weeks and then it disappeared *POOF* now it's back, and I keep checking to make sure it's there,(O_O) cause I'm afraid if I look away, it will disappear again-- it gets really exhausting (>..>You'll get it back!!! :D|`|VKRmIj6Gaa	*plays sad violin song*    I have once been there and I am still in that situation! T.T *pats you on the back* It's gonna be okay... ya hear me? okay... Just turn that depression into determination! Answer questions better... Answer them more... even if you don't feel like it just push yourself... T.T I really feel for you *Cries*.... I think I'm depressed again... Oh wait sorry sorry i'm supposed to be encouraging you! .. ^.^ *pats on back again* You can do it! We can do it!     *hears crowd cheers*     And oh yes.. that is a very spiffy avatar indeed... like mine? ^.^|`|4nwBCFiuaa	*sigh*..........*pats you in the back*  i lost my badge too.....-____-  a while ago....i know how you feel  BUT...i know we can get it back soon!!!  i know we can!! =P    *pokes you*  lets go steal it from someone......>__>  xD  jksjks    soo.....continue answering your best in questions!!!  and soon...that pwetty orange badge will come back!! xDD|`|XNIkS3KNaa	Aww I'm sorry you lost your badge!!

WE all know Led Zeppelin is the greatest band in history so why do the beatles have like sixty books about themselves in the public library wherever you go? It is annoying. The Who however, is a terrible band that had only like two hits and im tired of hearing about them all together. They are not in the same league as bands like bon jovi and cream.|`|vgcY5jHuaa	People thought their music was of the DEVIL. I mean, like death metal is considered now.  RESPECT THEM.

Here is the answer:     Do NOT do what Kajol did. She dropped out of college for acting. Besides family, education is the most important thing.    Finish your education, then right after. Maybe about 21 or 22.|`|51Lwze3Caa	well I would say there is no specific age to get into bollywood....but a normal degree should be sufficient and the most important important base to get into bollywood is modeling.best of luck...|`|wpkJFL5Qaa	depends on how preety u are , if ur mature at age 16 or 17 then thats good, or miss india later on like at age 21|`|04e0fa96acbc320b91b66dffc1fa2f97aa	even young children act in bollywood so there is no age limit yes but one must be old enough  to be of working age and have confidence to survive in the industry. but most important is one must give preference to education. so college or university but get educated first.|`|A8mKCXuUaa	18 or 19 that suits perfect.|`|nJKmOwvAaa	yes, go to college, start participating in college events and college festivals, start participating in fashion shows and drama and theatre|`|55G57psaaa	Minimum at 17 years

We are not sure who he really is... That would be great if it was to come out as Luke's long lost son..|`|NGNeT3rYaa	He said his name was Ethan Lovett and he is from Australia. I think he may be his son, he certainly came looking for him.|`|ZmGOL8kCaa	I think that he's Leyla's fiance. Why else would Leyla mention it? Just my opinion. :P|`|7XM4QJiuaa	His name is Ethan Lovett, there are rumors that he is an unknown son of Luke's.|`|UY3zl9dFaa	I think he's Brody Lovett's (OLTL) brother- just joking. I also think he's a son Luke never knew about. Being that he went straight for the casino, I have to think he was looking for Luke. He really seems like a "chip off the old block."

Klw3Ke3Haa	Why pair up those 2? Come on my Chinese pal, you're Chinese and you're smarter than that, you can come up with a much better matchup than that. But anyways they are both boring characters and sucks eggs but I go with Gin because he has Zanpakuto while the other dude doesn't. But "Superman Howard" will own both of them in basketball big time as well as a fight. Let's Go Magics!!! Orlando Magics 2009 NBA World Champions!!!.....    Consider this a warning from the Mighty Sun himself!|`|VKRmIj6Gaa	To the first answerer whether you come back and look at this or not... Having a zanpaktou doesn't matter much as long as you have a sword which Orochimaru has!... Kinda.. It's wierd and he pulls it out his mouth but it's definitely a sword! lol..take Kenpachi Zaraki for example.. and Himura Kenshin! He doesn't have a zanpaktou and he could evenly fight someone who could! All that to still say Ichimaru Gin but at least I made a point! ^.^|`|5hbNtQDIaa	Gin. i hope he kills Orochimaru..and Kabuto while hes at it lol|`|fawhiGtsaa	Orochimaru.|`|UcaxDuLqaa	OH!! Orochimaru is a pretty nasty character, but I bet Gin would make him scream like a little girl!!! --yeah Gin would hurt him real bad and just stand there and grin and squint in that awesome evil(ish) way--You know what I'm talkin about!! (>_|`|kuP2Ld1paa	i would think its orochimaru cuz he's old and rotten.  usually those kinds are more experienced the stealthy.|`|WS1rqp0Gaa	Ichimaru Gin|`|mQ8FZY0naa	Ichimaru Gin!     ~Hannah~|`|1haoFjfraa	Ichimaru Gin would win IMO mainly because of his dirty tactics skill, sword release which can do all sorts of things , plus his raw power, hes one of those rare captains who are strong enough to keep people pinned down with the sheer energy they have.  and for the person who said orichimaru is old and crafty or something like that, Gin is over a century old and was already a ranked officer 110 years before the main storyline.|`|fjFhZwyZaa	I find Ichimaru Gin more stronger.  So, Gin would win.|`|vqg6wpCLaa	I would say Gin.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Gin Ichimaru wins

Y1aAGPURaa	Here are a couple CEO funnies that should go well for your school show:      The CEO was scheduled to speak at an important convention, so he asked one of his employees to write him a punchy, 20-minute speech.    When the CEO returned from the big event, he was furious.    "What's the idea of writing me an hour-long speech?" he demanded to know. "Half the audience walked out before I finished."    The employee was baffled.  "I wrote you a 20-minute speech," he replied. "And I gave you the two extra copies you asked for."    --------------------------------------...    A large company, feeling it was time for a shakeup, hired a new CEO. The new boss was determined to rid the company of all slackers.     On a tour of the facilities, the CEO noticed a guy leaning on a wall. The room was full of workers and he wanted to let them know that he meant business.    He walked up to the guy leaning against the wall and asked, "How much money do you make a week?"    A little surprised, the young man looked at him and replied, "I make $400 a week. Why?"     The new CEO then handed the guy $1,600 in cash and screamed, "Here's four weeks pay, now GET OUT and don't come back!"    Feeling pretty good about himself, the CEO looked around the room and asked, "Does anyone want to tell me what that goof-ball did here?"    From across the room came a voice, "Pizza delivery guy."

2ogFk4Amaa	Light he thinks like I do, and I can tell what someones next move is going to be, and he has that evil side to him.|`|vqg6wpCLaa	I like L better. I find him to be a more interesting and intelligent character.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	L is. :)|`|kBek6QCLaa	L    most definitely|`|4Zj9eYgPaa	Even though I tend to like psychotic characters, I have to say L.  Light has those weird facial distortions and is simply crazy, plus he's conceited >_>  L has a cooler hairstyle, loves sweets, is funnier and knows capoeira! XD|`|5hbNtQDIaa	i like L. he is my favorite character in death note. I also like Near cus hes alot like L lol. i liked Light in the beginning but he was way to full of himself. I mean he was so cocky about himself, his looks which is a big turn off for me but then he got too cocky he let himself get caught by Near and the cops. It was bound to happen. I think if he was more careful and cautious that could have been avoided. I mean it was for a good cause but he did get a bit carried away. I mean he started to kill pety criminals too and then just anyone who got in his way even if they were good people and inocent. I understand killing some of the cops if they were really threatening your plan but not inocent everyday people. Or people that werent honor students like him dont deserve to die. And Near was right, he had reasonable intentions in the beginning but he just became a crazy serial killer. Well thats my opinion. Go L ^_^|`|bRjq7xZ5aa	Light was okay at the beginning. When he started humping L's grave, I think I threw up a little in my mouth, so I'll go with L. zomg...i'll have to shoot you w/ the Bloody Rose or something! I detest Kaname...i'm sorry, but he's just...gah.|`|MZFIJf1zaa	L is the best|`|zKYybuu7aa	Light is eventually corrupted by the Death Note... If you're talking about the pre-notebook Light or the memoryless-Light then I'll agree... to some extent. Otherwise, I'll choose L. L seems like the kind of person whom, based on his OWN appearance, wouldn't make me feel self conscious if my hair is messy or I'm wearing two different shoes. He eats sweets so if we were to marry, he wouldn't force me into a diet or anything...as far as I know.  But I could have just gotten this question wrong. Either way, Lawliet is SMEXY!!!  End of argument. :3|`|N4Y4BvJcaa	i like light too he put up a charade for so long he's very smart too and he has that cool attitude i could see why misa misa likes him but how he puts up with the guilt of killing won me over|`|wCGeer97aa	GO! LIGHT! though it's kinda lame how he dies in the end "when you die you go to nothingless" and Mikami was a retard I like Ryuk too|`|V66j18Whaa	L!  because we're the same in some ways.  and he's really smart.    aww.you're not weird.  you like Kaname over Zero?  me too!  does that mean i'm weird too?O_O|`|kuP2Ld1paa	I love L. Light may be all good looking and smart, but there is sth about L that is intriguing.  I only disliked Light because he killed L and Mello and they're like my fav. characters.    oh, and i like Zero better.  I dont know. He jus looks sooo hot when he is angry.  I dont like kaname cuz later on in the last chapters he looks sort of messed up.... his hair|`|VgnMCwgVaa	L is my favorite, mostly because he's so weird. He's like me in many ways. I love all his different quirks.|`|HRQjffv8aa	Light  - i just like light.. i just dont like it when he gets overly obsessive with the killing, aside from that light is my fav    and i agree w/ zephyre, i like light not kira|`|u3kxNTxhaa	L, although my favourite character is Near.|`|MX0s76pzaa	I like Light better. Not Kira, Light.  Kira is pure evil >.>    I like Zero over Kaname.     There's nothing with being weird, I like being weird XD

qOKFuXfLaa	which is that one?|`|bQp5uVCcaa	I LOVE Kevin Jonas!    He's funny, smart, fashionable, and a good singer.    He's just shy, and not many people like how he looks or dresses|`|AA10368887	Because people like you keep asking questions like this over and over ad nauseam.|`|bH37fDw4aa	because he's like 21 and still in the jonas brothers, which makes him seem creepy  and he's the ugliest of the three|`|LnjyQDpBaa	i dont know but your not a true fan unless you love all 3.|`|8ku6ox0Taa	I LOVE HIM!

But I loveeee Kevin. Joe is my favorite but Kevin is myyyyy man too. Sooo yeah I think that's the reason but who cares. KEVIN IS THE BOMB DIGGIDYYY! Who can spin really fast and still play guitar.... only Kevin.   :)  |`|tuaRbI1Yaa	I think because he's the oldest, and many of their fans are somewhat younger. Also, he doesn't sing much, and most younger girls gravitate towards the singers in bands. Furthermore, most people don't consider him as attractive as his brothers.|`|uMseesTAaa	Probably because he's the oldest of all of them.  But I don't know why some people favorite just one person in a band but they say "I love the Jonas Brothers!" and yet they only like Nick or Joe. It's so stupid. I like 'em all equally|`|vGtM2F5Caa	theyre stupid!  HE IS SEXY!!|`|5wilVKEdaa	Aww I don't know!  Kevin is so nice!  And he's so cute!  He's even better looking in person.

You know. the girls that are all LYKE AW MAH GAWD I LOVE THEM.  Yeah.|`|8yA3W8VXaa	well...I don't know a lot of people who don't but its only because hes older  and can seem like a follower (not my opinion I love them!)    I DON'T agree though, my friends and i loveeee themmm!!!  one of my best friends swears shes gonna marry Kevin and the other Joe. me...nick(:|`|qdL4onHpaa	cuz some people say he's gay and that he is the oldest brother but I love all three of them and Frankie too|`|X7W3Zs08aa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsRr3RnIB...      hope this helps!|`|FFQiWeeYaa	because he's ugly and dumb just like the other two.

Sorry.  10,000 if you're lucky.  But it would end up being more like 100,000.  Think of it like this:  The Jonas Brothers have an incredibly busy schedule.  Raking in thousands of dollars PER CONCERT.  Now, to perform for one girl, you would have to match that.  Oh, and the Jonas Brothers are terrible.  I'm a better guitarist than Kevin and Nick combined.  They are both ridiculously overrated.

Mfydk73Yaa	Basically, Ricky tells Jack that he is in interested in Amy, and Amy says "I love him" but we don't know to who. Amy and Ricky hug, and I guess Ben feels sort of jealous (again.) His father sort of infers that this was "BOUND" to happen and Ben sort of walks away. Adrian and Grace get in a fight over Ricky, Adrian uses comments like, "He DOESN'T even love you!"         P.S. I can't wait until this episode comes out!!!!! I love the Secret Life.|`|TKZAYJokaa	it showed ricky trying to become involved with amy for the babys sake, also showed amy saying "but i love him"  im assuming shes talking about the baby but the preview mays it seem like ricky since right before it it showed her and ricky hugging.....

7sT23ry3aa	Tell your friends you have malaria...and that there is no cure where you are staying, and that they want to rrun tests on you (dangerous ones)...lol|`|H2bFiDNAaa	it sounds funny but i don't think anyone would believe you..|`|7kKlaF5Laa	its ok|`|lTFDQHixaa	That's so funny!  I think this is perfect, maybe make a fake video and send to them.. and I think the rest is perfect.  ;D|`|Da1krM3Daa	i think this is perfect!!! i would love to see their Expression!!!|`|LlYyGYSJaa	Why would you ever do this to your friends?
QAwwmDuDaa	I'm not sure which one you mean,the scientist,the song writer or the actor,i looked it up and got quite a few hits for that name,hey at least i tried dear.|`|LuK19ZFPaa	No
TKZAYJokaa	i think ricky will turn out to be a good guy, hes just had a hard life and is going through heavy stuff.....  i think amy is whiny tho, and if that baby gets adopted i might stop watching, she should face her responsibilities and take care of the baby herself. i also think her mom n dad will get back together.  i was surprised to see her dad considering the gay couple tho.  i cant wait for the next episode.....i think shes gonna decide against adoption...i hope so anyways......|`|a8xY9rRgaa	ricky isn't a bad guy he didn't ask for any of that and he is at least trying so you got to give him some credit|`|ILR3rlmkaa	haha i havent watched tonights yet..too much hw.  but yeah. i totally agree. the shows put a new light on ricky. showing that he actually cares and has a conscience!!!!  i love secret life!  my family thinks its stupid, but i rather like it!  i luv kyle xy too

vqg6wpCLaa	The Hulk because he could easily crush Wolverine with barely any effort.|`|Vk1FoxsRaa	hulk|`|hzH75VDXaa	Wolverine wins hands down.    Wolverine has basically become unstoppable.  He has survived having his heart ripped out of his chest and being decapitated in the comics.  He's incapable of dying at this point, so Hulk would eventually tire, or be killed by Wolverine.|`|ZXlzOVRbaa	Wolverine = Claws that can leave a pretty nasty scratch.  Hulk = Hands that could crack open any mans skull with no effort needed.    ...Yep...  I choose the Hulk.. even though I'm not a fan big of either.

I cant wait for next week's episode...but I didnt see previews for it. So I hope its new.|`|X7W3Zs08aa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsRr3RnIB...      hope this helps!|`|29def525b4de3e4f1e95aaabfaa25f77aa	Dan isn't too swift and it was clear from day one that he wanted to nail the teacher. Dan is such a hypocrite. He is always spouting goodness and holier than thou yet he does the worst things. He is so fickle towards Serena that she just needs to dump him for good. The teacher was pretty but what an idiot. Ever hear of statutory rape? No boy/stud is worth losing everything for.|`|kHY0eMVraa	I watched it!!!  but I had to leave at the last 5 minutes so I don't know.|`|AA10368887	"Why did Dan do that! ?"    Because it was in the script.
b1294888a8e10ac6a8ff0614d97982ccaa	I don't know, Why follow that great Gorilla drumming advert with that rubbish?    No Nicky, it's not just you i hate it too.|`|gGZz2EGyaa	Got to agree with you on this one, I cannot stand that advert.  It is very creepy those kids moving eyebrows all the time.  They have had the great advert with the gorilla and I thought how would Cadbury top that, well they haven't yet!  Okay so gorilla and chocolate do not go together but at least you remember the name Cadbury and I would have thought that was the whole point of advertising. The advert with eyebrows makes you want to forget the chocolate and put you off buying their product.|`|u7o75zipaa	I f*cking hate that advert. I don't know why, it just really pisses me off though!  All my friends seem to love it, so maybe it's just me lol.|`|TtOCh3JSaa	I love it! The girl is so cute!|`|wuwUHukwaa	I love it.   Cadbury have great ads.  The gorilla one was my favourite though but I love Phil Collins.  I think those kids are great.  Bet you tried do that with your eyebrows and failed miserably. lol|`|oDn5I0jKaa	It's a bit freaky. Funny though, i've seen other people react strongly to this advert. My brother is a graphic designer and hates the advert, says what's the point of it. My sister on the other hand said she loved it. I guess it must be a marmite kinda advert.|`|M34gxEKraa	The gorilla wasn't too bad and the airport one was ok but this new one?!    Wot were they thinking. Nicky- you definitely aren't the only one who does not like the ad!|`|dd1c4772483cf17b8d588eaddff60b28aa	It gives me the heeby jeebies!  What is it with their eyebrows and then the balloon???    However, it has done what it is meant to do, hasn't it?  We have all noticed it and that is the purpose of adverts, eh???
bWI43goqaa	i think i found it man.......    http://www.mp3lyrics.org/l/lee-aaron/roc...      good luck!|`|TZeKta4haa	idk it does not sound like a popular song................its not is it?|`|f8l4KCYoaa	i don't know about the "rock with me" part, but it reminds me of this song by The Vines called "Ride"
kuP2Ld1paa	u'll love Ouran High School Host Club! Its a rly sweet and funny manga.  but if ur up for something more excited, try Vampire Knight, its sooo good, and it is drwn sooooo well. Death Note is good too, but i only saw the anime.  Read Ouran High and Vampire Knight.  Trust me, it'll keep u reading and reading. its very addictive.|`|XNzj7b7Taa	gakuen alice|`|wCGeer97aa	try Gin-Tama if you like funny and random stuff|`|n1dmMABvaa	Lucky Star, Lucky Star, and Lucky Star. XD  It's FUNNY and RANDOM.  Oh, Pani Poni Dash is really funny, too.  I've heard Ouran High School Host Club is good.  And then there's The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya...|`|nOLVHNaBaa	death note|`|hoPEnlo5aa	read manga from erika kurahashi or mayu sakai  they are my favorite mangakas  but it doesn't have anime version  search it at mangafox.com|`|LgAK1QVMaa	njo
L6jKwlyXaa	I think this song is Lupe going, "Oh my! I've made it big." And not entirely believing that his previous album got acclaimed and loved and did so well.
RtG5Iarbaa	How old are you?  People as young as 15 can usually get jobs at McDonalds, or other fastfood places.    If your good with sports, try scorekeeping or reffing for your school or possibly former school to make some money.|`|k6uRrQ9uaa	make some crafts or take up knitting and sell em' on ebay or etsy!    you can also babysit...     or i heard that you can make a site and get paid to hold adds on there. I'm not too sure about that one, you'll have to look it up.|`|sz1YqwUEaa	Use whatever old instruments you have and than start playing shows for some money so you can get real instruments.

wDnP5b0Oaa	I lost my number, can i have yours?  You must be in a wrong place - the Miss Universe contest is over there.   Was that an earthquake or did u just rock my world?   I may not be a genie but I can make your dreams come true   Are you a magnet cuz im attracted to you   Does this rag smell like chloroform to you?   I wish you were DSL so I could get high-speed access.   I know its not Christmas, but Santa's lap is always ready.   Baby your like a student and I am like a math book, you solve all my   problems   "Why does it feel like the most beautiful girl in the world is in this   room?"   Can I take a picture of you, so I can show Santa just what I want for   Christmas.   Do you have any raisins? No? How about a date?  I was blinded by your beauty so I'm going to need your name and number for insurance reasons.  I'm sorry, were you talking to me? Her: No. Well then, please start.  I know I dont have a chance, but I just wanted to hear an angel talk.  Roses are red, violets are blue, how would you like it if I came home with you?  Hey I just realized this, but you look alot like my next girlfriend.  Are your legs tired, because you've been running through my mind all day long.   Are you lost? Because heaven's a long way from here.  POOF! (What are u doing?) I'm here, where are your other two wishes?  I hope you know CPR, because you take my breath away.  Girl, you better have a license, cuz you are driving me crazy!  If you were the new burger at McDonalds you would be the Mcgorgeous!  Do you have the time? (she gives you the time) No, the time to write my number down .  Let's make like a fabric softener and snuggle.  Are you an interior decorator? When I saw you the room became beautiful.  Hello, I'm a thief, and I'm here to steal your heart.  Is that top felt? [No] Would you like it to be?   Apart from being sexy, what do you do for a living?  Is your last name Gillete cause your the best a man can get.   Are you a parking ticket? (What?) You got fine written all over you.  I'm invisible. (Really?) Can you see me? (Yes) How about tomorrow night?  You can fall off a building, you can fall out a tree, but baby, the best way to fall is in love with me.  I have never had a dream come true until the day that I met you.  You look life my first wife! (how many have you had?) none.  Do you have a sunburn, or are you always this hot?  I'm addicted to yes, and I'm allergic to no. So what's it gonna be?  If I could rearrange the alphabet, I'd put U and I together.  Turn to the girl sitting next to you at the bar and say... "I'm not really this tall....I'm sitting on my wallet."  This is a test of the emergency pickup line service. Beeeeeeeeeep. If you had been any less beautiful, you would have just heard a bad pickup line.  If this bar is a meat market, you must be the prime rib.  I know I'm not a grocery item but I can tell when you're checking me out.  If beauty were sunlight, you'd shine from a million light-years away.  Do you mind if I hang out here until its safe back where I farted.  Life without you would be like a broken pencil...pointless.  Your body is a wonderland and i want to be Alice.  I'm like chocolate pudding, I look like crap but im as sweet as can be.  Can I have directions? ["To where?"] To your heart.   Are you an alien? because you just abducted my heart.  Did you fart, 'cause you blow me away!   I hope there's a fireman around, cause you're smokin'!  If you were a booger I'd pick you first.  Excuse me, I think you have something in your eye. Nope, it's just a sparkle.  You've been a bad girl/boy. Go to my room.  If beauty were time, you'd be an eternity.  Do you know karate? 'Cause your body is really kickin'.  Are you as beautiful on the inside as you are on the outside?  Like the sheets on your bed I want cover you with love.  Do you have a Bandaid? Because I just scraped my knee falling for you.  Hi, I just wanted to give you the satisfaction of turning me down; go ahead say no.  I hope your day is as radiant as your smile.   You make me melt like hot fudge on a sundae.  You know what? Your eyes are the same color as my Porsche.  Are you an alien?, because you just abducted my heart.  What has 142 teeth and holds back the incredible hulk? My zipper.|`|wQ6fAAokaa	do you have a mirror in your pants because i can see myself in them  haha i heard that one a couple of days ago|`|vrGjDDmzaa	i got skittles in my mouth, you wanna taste the rainbow?    her: what are you doing?

I wish you were a door so that I could slam you all day    You have 206 bones in your body, want just one more?    Are you from UPS because I just caught you checking out my package    Wow!, nice legs, what time do they open?    The word of today is legs, let's go back to my place and spread the word

zZ3KKGu7aa	Episode 204 is the latest english subbed episode. The next one, episode 205, will be subbed sometime tomorrow. Usually late afternoon or evening.    Edit: Well, I usually go to anime-media to watch the epsiodes.  The videos are hosted on various streaming sites but their primary choices are either Veoh or MySpace Video. The RAW is usually posted first, then the subbed version replaces it when its released.    Edit 2: 205 is now subbed.
JD9E1Y3uaa	Don't Keep Me Waiting by Sharleen Spiteri, on the album Melody
9HtT0RiGaa	My fave at the moment (should be able to sample them from myspace) -     1 Halou  2 Air Formation  3 Hartfield  4 Pains of Being Pure At Heart  5 Electone (from Singapore ..yes!!)|`|zewRBWE7aa	I've been listening to The Meeting Places lately. "Same Lies as Yesterday" reminds me a little of Slowdive.|`|WhAKntgGaa	New? Dunno.    Just listen to Jesus and Mary Chain...or My Bloody Valentine.|`|iWWfAQFhaa	I don't know what is shoegaze  ? the new wave or new band   ayak2 wae ya
Z0I5Qvk7aa	Pretty sure it's "Zombie" by the Cranberries. The reason you're having no luck is the lyrics are, "In your head."  I could be wrong, but I think that's what you're looking for.
10xAG5qyaa	thay have a new link http://watch-movies-links.net/|`|0Jdc603Uaa	they shut down to upgrade their servers, and for some reason switched their url to    http://www.watch-movies-links.net/    Enjoy!|`|MzmDqZ26aa	Who cares. Quicksilverscreen and tv-links are best right now.|`|9025b6ac4856e7655881c6f1c8293986aa	Could be one of many reasons....    They could have closed down to refurbish the site.  Having technical issues and the server as gone down, or  The feds have asked them to pass on users info (IP addys and such) to help crack down on illegal movies. Even tho they wasn't doing anything illegal.  They have done this to a few sites, and every site i know of have refused and shut down because of it.    Watch-movies was a good site aswell, one of the bests!|`|TWEugtXjaa	The police may have shut it down because it was hosting illegal  content or something, but if that were the case they would also need to shut down google, because google does pretty much the exact same thing. Google hosts illegal content from other sites, just as watch-movies.net does. So it really makes no sense, maybe they're just changing servers? But it's been about four days since it's worked for me.|`|LSeek6fGaa	I know man if you find a new site or something let me know on my browser it says that there is no such website. It probably means it got completely obliterated no more watch movies.net hopefully they bring it back up and all but I heard it has happened more then once. Probably the FEDS caught up with them or something and shutdown for a while till it's all clear man. Anyone knows another good website then let us know and like serriously I don't even know why it is so illegal in the first place.|`|9cNTkhmQaa	It started to suck

I don't remember what scene its though|`|qMJCKw0qaa	It is finding nemo - and Darla when she comes into the dentist office -|`|C021mpLLaa	Finding Nemo, when Darla(retarded girl) goes to the dentist.
Zxtiewnyaa	well it was his sister connie who had called cuz her husband was the one who had beaten her up so sonny was on his way to their house when he ended up getting assassinated at the railway crossing.It was connie's husband who made the setup so the other rival family could kill him|`|yZAcwN3haa	santonio aka sonny was talking to connies(sister) fiance,i forgot his name.But Michael had him killed in the back of the car if you dont remeber that scene>?    Dr.Lung|`|Vw2M1zXXaa	his sister called him and off he went.  her husband set it up but it was connie who made the call|`|AwBVoWOaaa	huge spoiler in your question..  I don't remember|`|WchfVMsPaa	I believe it was his sister who called him saying that her husband beat her again and it was the husband who set Sonny up. He knew the route he would take to get to the house and had the goons there to kill him. Now this is what I have always thought I don't know if it's correct.

L6jKwlyXaa	DJ Earworm - United State of Pop 2008 (Viva La Pop)    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLaZ-8IMt...|`|5ydqCVE2aa	Could be by Girltalk|`|4238b0852033a10b1212f733c838d59eaa	I'm not sure of the name of the song, but the artist doing it (I think) goes by the name Girl Talk.  He's a DJ/producer, and he has a whole album of stuff like that.  He samples fragments of songs, and puts 'em all together.  There's a track called "Hands In The Air" where he's sampled Flo-Rida's "Low" as well as "In A Big Country" by Big Country.

aihogb26aa	She was once a candidate for House's new team. After she was cut, House found out that she had started to date Wilson and they got engaged but House never really approved ( we eventually found out her name is Amber). She and House got in a bus accident because she picked House up from a bar when he was really drunk (he had called Wilson's house to have Wilson come pick him up but Wilson wasn't home, so Amber came to get him). She died from injuries in the accident and Wilson blamed House.|`|efwvtzitaa	amber. she died. multiple organ failure.|`|y5WPZ8dJaa	Yes, it was her. Amber is her name.

f7aed29e039705f0fc131842b8d52d13aa	Tony and Stephanie don't become a couple, Tony says he just wants to stay friends and see where that takes them. Tony tells Stephanie that he wants to move to Manhattan to escape his family and his friends in Brooklyn and start over. He seems to really want to change his ways and leave his past behind him.    As for themes I would probably say leaving your past behind and moving forward, living your life the way you want instead of how everyone expects you too, and dealing with losses.    I hope I was able to help you. Good luck on your essay!
urPIrJcUaa	Your best bet is going to General Hospital Happenings. They said that Ethan will tie the Spencers to a very different family with whom they've had deep ties with in the past.  They also said Trevor will die but from what they say it sounds like it will be a lot more of a dramatic exit than the truck driver, Andy or Leyla have.  They also say who has the missing sphere and what happens to it.|`|XRPtuwoTaa	Grifter Ethan Lovett is being played by Nathan Parsons.   Leyla & Trevor die  Looks like Nadine's leaving too, not sure if she's going to be a victim of the disaster|`|fIWwLRIMaa	i have heard that ethan is dante and that he is frisco's son making him maxie's brother, but those are just rumors.     i have also heard that leyla and trevor die. also nadine kind of vanishes but doesn't die, she just won't be on our screens anymore.|`|EhBF31evaa	I think Layla and Trevor will die.  I don't know who Ethan will turn out to be but maybe Robert and Holly's son.  I hope it isn't Luke and Holly's son.  Luke has enough kids that he has spent his whole life avoiding.|`|CFZ4ISNNaa	I usually get my spoilers from ghofs.net or the myspace site: http://ghofs.blogspot.com/    Leyla, Andy( the anesthesiologist), Trevor, and Early die.    Ethan is a con guy who tries to rob Luke. I've heard alot of theories on Ethan's background...Dante using a fake accent, Luke or Robert's long lost son with Holly. Mac's long lost kid. Jerry's son, or Jacks relative, Eli Love's kid, the list goes on and on...    I'm personally tired of long lost kids. Let's resolve the issues with the long lost kids we already got...(Matt, Dante, possibly Rebecca...)|`|M1ymLE9Paa	The people who are spoiled to die are: Trevor, Leyla, Andy the anesthegeologist, and the guy who came in for surgery.      Here's what I found about Dante:    New Cast Member  A new role has been cast on General Hospital debuting the week of January 26th. In the recurring role of Ethan will be Nathan Parsons. We will first see Ethan at the Haunted Star when he is caught breaking into the Haunted Star by Luke. Later on, Ethan thinks he has gotten away with some major grifting but Luke blindsides him at an out-of-town watering hole. Luke knows Ethan from his previous travels.    Ethan has an Australian accent, giving us hints he may be a Jax or Scorpio. OR, is he faking the accent, and in reality is Dante? (Didnt we have a RUMOR saying we might see Dante on Jan 26th?) Thats one RUMOR floating around this week. Whoever he is related to, we should eventually find out. Im also hearing Ethan MAY be the one who ultimately rescues Lulu. Plus, Luke COULD track Ethan down to offer him a job.|`|UY3zl9dFaa	I don't have any spoilers, just theories. The only one who seems certain to die is poor Leyla. Not only is she in really bad shape, but she finally found happiness. I think Ethan is Luke's son- they seem so alike and he said that he never knew his Dad. Besides, why else did he show up at the casino first? He must've been looking for Luke.|`|AA12336927	Hi Bree,   I don't know who Dante is, but personally, I'm hoping it turns out to be someones long lost son. Perhaps Luke and Holly's or Robert and Holly's|`|zyTvtgS2aa	I thought Ethan might be Lukes long lost son. just a thought    but I know for sure Leyla is going to die and Monica  and also Nadine.|`|b2f5cc892d9a2ff6d43172b4bb022096aa	I have heard Trevor, Leyla, and Nadine, die, and Monica comes close, but does not die.    I love the interaction between Luke and Ethan !  I don't think there is any way he is Dante, supposedly he was raised in Brooklyn.  No Aussie accent there  lol.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	Trevor, Leyla, Andy and the guy on the OR table will die. Ethan is somehow connected to Luke most likely since he can looking for him. Definately not Dante, he should have a Bensonhurst accent not Australian but anything is possible I guess.|`|7XM4QJiuaa	Trevor is going to die. Ethan is rumored too be a long lost son of Luke's.

Did you not bother looking? Did you not think about using the search bar?    To add insult to injury, it is not classical music - it is bad instrumental pop and we in this forum are sick tired of the endless questions (all of them the same!) about this piece of pop pap.    Finally, why should we waste time giving people 'the notes'? If you want to play music, you should learn to read music. It's not that difficult. Children of 3 and 4 can do it and, therefore, so can you.

A good detail visual is on the DVD I Love The Trumpet By Warren Vache available online at amazon.com or warrenvache.com.  Also the valve oil you use may not be good. Suggest Al Cass oil for new horns and a slightly thicker  valve oil for older trumpets Zaja Blue. I use both and they do the job. But the key is they work fine if your trumpet is properly cleaned ! Maybe on YouTube you might find a trumpet cleaning how to. And one more...oil your valves every time you play.  Yes I just saw some YouTube how to clean and maintain the trumpet and I do not recommend them because some are not accurate with their information and I saw one where they had a can of WD 40!!

In my option, it seems like a funny place to leave a season final. xD  So, I doubt it was the last episode. I'm sure there would have been way more notice about it like on The CW or the websites I visit.  Also, I've watched it before when there was no promo and the next day I went online and it was there!    Hope I helped! :D

It's due to the fact that NBC produces the show but it's on FOX.  If you can't watch the show when it's on the TV tonight then you would have to wait to watch it in 8 days (like I do).  It will be found on fox.com, hulu.com and television.aol.com.  I want to watch the show but I can't watch last weeks until tomorrow so I can't watch them out of order!!

a1Ngi39Xaa	They were/are the greatest and most influential band in history, yes.  I agree with you there.  They also made some great movies.  I had older sisters when I was growing up so I got introduced to the Beatles at a very young age!    I think there are a lot of other awesome bands as well, however, but the Beatles were just there at the right time and were able to have a lot of influence.

One of the human kingdoms, the peaceful Valley of Wind, loves its gentle Princess Nausica? and her father the king, but their peace is about to be broken, as they are swallowed up in the machinations of their larger, warmongering neighbours.

bFIlgwV8aa	Venus Pisces, Mars Virgo, but the Mars could conceivably be in Libra depending on where she was born. I can confirm if you post the place of birth.|`|mD7eAAoNaa	Virgo Mars  You are down to earth, and when you crave drama, you buy tickets to a play, not to a relationship! Logical, and disciplined, you probably have a knack of weeding out all the fluff and annoyance of needless pomp and circumstance. If your Mars is in Virgo, you most definitely will not be an emotional game player! You have an enthusiasm that cannot be matched when you've found a worthy cause. Your efforts are tireless, and you possess great mental skills that enable you to focus and therefore excel at whatever you do. You may be restless and need constant activity or thought to satiate your mind. Lovers may not compare to the ideal, but you are more than willing to expend some of your energy understanding the details of a real relationship! You offer support to your lovers and are happiest when others' intentions are made clear.  http://horoscopes.astrology.com/tn/mars/...    Pisces Venus  Those with their Venus in Pisces are often in love with the notion of being in love. Not very real, eh? Call it fantasy if you will, but those enjoying this placement are sensitive, compassionate and romantic souls who simply march to the beat of a different drummer. Much like the Fish who grace their House of Love, these folks love to swim in the sea of love. It's wet, wild and wonderful in there! Even so, this intense desire to be in love can lead to seeing what they want to see, not what is really there. How can this be? Isn't love supposed to be beautiful and true? Once again, a bit of fantasy mixed with reality, but that's what happens when Venus is visited by Pisces. As well, those with their Venus in Pisces see love and sexuality as spiritual experiences: a state of love is not worth achieving unless it is accompanied by complete transcendence and bliss. Not everyone can swim in this sea, but for those who can, it's a complete experience. Having your Venus in Pisces may mean that you spend a lot of time explaining yourself, especially where affairs of the heart are concerned. That's okay, because these people would only want to be with someone who appreciates, and understands, their often misunderstood soul.  http://love.astrology.com/Lsvenus.html
AA10690306	The Spleen passed gas and blamed an old gypsy woman who cursed him with his "power" because of the false accusation.      As to the satire there are a number of ways starting with their names.    Someone else can give you the rest, I did my share.
CFJzBMwkaa	the surgeon is the mom|`|5vgnrvcmaa	The doc is his mom.|`|OBc5JlwJaa	The surgeon is the son's mother. The crime is the dude that's driving drunk that hits them... cause he's driving drunk, which is illegal.|`|AA11905223	his mom is the doctor, there is a crime (drunk driving), they would be buried/cremated and there would be a manslaughter suit.|`|tbwp9Ko8aa	The mum is the doctor.  Funny how most people assume the doctor is a man.|`|AA10913583	surgeon would be the mother of the son. The crime is drunk driving and homicide if the father and/or the son dies. This could be tried in criminal or civil suit     But then again, they are in the interstate freeway so the wall should have stop the drunk driver from driving on the opposite side.|`|vUT0WEzdaa	well, the surgeon is the father of the father (grandfather of the son)  crime is the drunk driver|`|nenWzoinaa	the mom is the doctor|`|tRAHbAL8aa	The mother is the doctor.|`|DCBfON0Raa	the surgeon is the son's mom..    yeah the drunk driver could be charged with murder      the mother would be a widow and childless    hmm maybe|`|ixBNVvYtaa	The surgeon is the mother.  The crime is drunk driving. If both die, then the driver could be charged with vehicular homicide and negligence.|`|R9iPmdqXaa	the mom's the doctor
9yhp2WLAaa	the easiest thing to do is to put all the music on a cd. how many songs  are on his list?  The PS3 will rip CDs and save the entire album to the hard drive. When you put the CD in, go to the music section, scroll down to the CD icon, and press the triangle button.  Then select 'Import' and it will begin to copy the CD to the hard drive.  Good Luck|`|tVoMXFDRaa	I agree with the post above...But what you probably need to do is burn the songs onto a CD and then burn the CD onto the PS3. At least thats what you have to do on an XBOX 360|`|xXyy51Efaa	Come on, let your son do it on his own. I mean, can't he just appreciate the gift and do the rest on his own??|`|DpStw8RBaa	Or you could just make him do it himself... my parents didn't cater to my every whim. I know it's his birthday, but isn't the ps3 enough?|`|i0B5Q2SKaa	happy b day to u happy b  day to u happy b day to your son happy b day to yoouuuu|`|Jb26nbekaa	1. go on Windows Media Player  2. Go on 'Sync' at the top.  3. then put music in there..     * If you have another site with your sons songs, then just go to the site first.    2. Drag each song to Windows Media Player   3. After you put all songs, go to Windows Media Player.  4. Go to search and look for first song ( put first name of song) and then drag it to the (on the right) a rectangle and a device on top and your suppose to drag songs into it....    5. Keep doing this and keep fishing out songs 1 by 1 from Search Bar and then just press Sync on the bottom when you are done      Congratz to your son! Have a Happy Bday, tell 'em!|`|FwJLD1uDaa	umm, i think its enough that you got it for him in the 1st place. let him figure it out, dont have mommy do it.|`|OP0xrMZraa	calm down ok. I am kid that could help u. First put the disc in a computer and transfer the songs in the CD and then put it in the ps3 and download them. You can also do the same thing with a usb

And the books! The only thing I didn't like is they changed too much. I don't think I'll like new moon though cause I don't like Jacob and he's in it a lot and Edward is gone!!! Ugh, I wish Edward didn't leave! Haha, but it'll still be okay cause TWILIGHT ROX!!!|`|Dn6xHIIRaa	it's so not over rated.  the book, of course, is better than the movie, but the movie isn't all that bad. it was pretty good for such a long book.  the books are definitely better, but the movie is good too.|`|K8a3a6PNaa	I never read the books, therefore i loved the movie. However, i have a friend who read the books and said the movies skipped a lot. She liked the movie, but was disappointed it didn't come up to the standards of the book. I hate when that happens. I rather sit through a three hour movie and get in every detail rather then sit through an hour in a half movie that skipped some what could of been really good scenes. I'm kind of glad i didn't read the book or else i have a hunch i''d be disappointed.|`|32FvVHYFaa	well i saw the movie before i read the book--i thought itll b super boring  it was ok|`|2tYgxHvtaa	heard the book was better|`|sqbuYfJQaa	Suuuuuuuuuckd! I thought both the movie and book are real cheesetastic.|`|uKVxkc6xaa	I think that the books were better than the movie and i think new moon will be good but not as good as the book.|`|h1xvACAnaa	really really really overrated|`|o49LMHwvaa	the movie was suckyyy compared to the book. oops.|`|56CWUcjZaa	twilight is over rated. it's really not great people. weird kids like twilight.|`|vQtSPEUGaa	Don't like the book or the movie personally. I could easily see how a lot of people like it, but just not into that kind of story.|`|1uJ9oy0Haa	A lot of people say the movie is really terrible but I don't see why. I loved the movie! I've never read the book and don't play on it but it was a really good movie.|`|4Ke0qknOaa	i thought the movie was okay but the book was wayyy good!!! i think that new moon will be pretty good...... at least i hope so!!|`|pIMXHktGaa	the book was alright. the movie sucked though. i think the new moon movie is gonna be even worse.|`|Vwj1znc5aa	The Book is the best thing that happened to the world and the movie was pretty good when u watch it but after u sit bac and compare the movie and book u will notice that the book is 1000000...times better|`|qnBIXPx5aa	awesome but the book ruins the whole movie so wach the move fist p.s do not read the book if your going to wach the movie|`|MnXdgX7kaa	My Opinion on the Twilight Books is that the books were great! The movie was great! Its was very dramatic like its supposed to be. Summit Entertainment did a great job at picking the actors suited for the personality of each character of Twilight. New Moon I think will be great to but they should make sure that every scene that is important in the book is in the movie.|`|tC02KPckaa	The movie was a disappointment. It was not even close to the book. I mean they knew how important the movie was to people. But they messed it up really bad.|`|TRcJISMpaa	WOW, GREAT MOVIE, IT  WAS WELL DONE, AWESOME ACTORS, GOOD FICTION STORY AND IF I MAY I WOULD LIKE TO ADD SOMETHING ELSE; I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW THERE WAS NOT ANY SEXUAL CONTENT...|`|4x2KMVbBaa	LOVED the books and the movie! I can't wait for New Moon and I think it'll be better than Twilight.|`|rqH8mAM2aa	I SEE A BAD MOON RISING|`|yxoXTmlqaa	Like most cult films, it lacked serious integrity.|`|lwDz2bE8aa	the movie was horrible|`|NBf5q2f5aa	omg i LOVE the books but the movie was horrible with the new director i hope new moon will b better...can u beliee stephenie might not do midnnight sun'???? im soo mad =[ but happy reading! =]|`|JdpkRtGfaa	I don't care what everyone else says, it's my favourite movie ever! I am going to an open casting call for New Moon this weekend.|`|AA12270666	el libro es muy bien pero la pelicular , NO.      sorry, felt like answering in espanol there.      the movie was okay, did not compare to the book very well, not as accurate in detail as the book.    new moon will hopefully be better beause there is a new director (Chris Weitz) . . . but there's less of Edward.. NOOOO!! ahahah[:  i only like the character edward, i dont really like r.patzz as they call him, in real life.   hopefully new moon will be more detailed like the book was, and i hope they keep in some good scenes and don't take out any like they did with twilight (the blood test scence)|`|a0485d6e140f545851f1532083dff0e5aa	Manicorn

I'm not sure why they would tour with a band like Slipknot...  And open for them none the less. -___-'   That's why I wouldn't go. I would have to knock out people that booed Coheed. No one does that to Claudio on my watch.   /eye twitch
Mwq6uMboaa	Well Ricky and Amy talked about having the baby adopted. Amys dad goes and talkes to two of his friends and they said that they were wanting to adopt. They asked if Amy would let them adopt the baby if she was going to let the baby get adopted. Ricky finally let Amy do what she think was right for the baby. Jack tells Grace that Ricky is still sleeping with Adrain. That was what I rember. Hope I helped :-)|`|r9FlMY4paa	if you want to watch it then just go to abcfamily.com it comes on again at midnight too.  =]     tonights episode was really good! and i think you should probably want to see it for yourself.
OTj8vfQzaa	I think it is going to happen when it is down to the final two or maybe when they go on the fantasy dates. It looks like they are somewhere out of the country and in a hotel.   I think she is just going to give him advice on picking the right one. I really don't think she is going to try to get him back. They just try to make it look like that to add drama.|`|NgtIBEG8aa	Ok i have been wondering about this too! I am a very observant person, watch the preview for the season here  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bo4op2Ia4... When it shows DeAnna coming back a bunch of girls in the pool looking up at her on the balcony, including shannon, nikki, lauren, and that blonde haired girl. It also shows shannon saying "when i saw u with DeAnna i wanted to cry....im hanging by a thread here". Shannon is gone already! and she has already said the "im hanging by a string" line to jason. So im guessing they are gonna be jerks and not air that drama. I HOPE  IM WRONG because i think thats what everyone has been looking forward too, but unless all of the girls come back for a "reunion" or something and DeAnna comes back, it has already happened earlier in the season and they arent gonna show it. Maybe ABC is just good at editing and they made us believe it would be earlier in the season and it is still  coming, but so far it hasnt been showed yet and not sure its going to.|`|XnTdmC5Naa	I am going to say when it is down to the final two.    Reason behind this is that when Jason starts balling his eyes out in the preview. He does it on the top of balcony where the climate seems pretty warm. Meaning it is going to be when the final rose ceremony happens close to the beach in Cabo or something.      So 2 weeks from now|`|9rLi9pSRaa	So next week we go to the girl's parents homes and then the following week the remaining girl's go to his family's home so maybe that week at the end of the show or the following week.  We certainly have been kept waiting a long time for it.  Talk about teasers!!|`|Ukgl64pSaa	No idea.  Next week Jason goes to the girls home towns. After watching tonight, he is such a caring gentleman - the way he let Stephanie go telling her that the spark just was not there.  I don't see him with Naomi at all.|`|ClRuPRs7aa	I am wondering the same thing. I really don't know when it's gonna happen but I have a strong feeling it is going to happen next episode; next week (Feb 9th). I got mad when I saw that in the the preview because I think she has no right to be there. She had her chance, and now she just wants more attention.|`|hghQ7Hhraa	omg. me and my parents are wondering the same thing. we thought we had missed it. i am so happy that other people are saying the same stuff. i dont think she should stay. i mean, yea, people make mistakes, but she already had her chance with 25 different men and she made a wrong choice but its his chance now and he has already fallen in "love" with other people. if he wanted deanna back he wouldve pawning for her instead of coming on the show! idk. it makes me angry just thinking about it. i hope its next week though. but it is probably the last week because next week is hometown dates and she cant follow him around to everyones hometown trying to look for him. i am just wondering who the idiot was that is giving her another chance on the show. she should call him or something. not show up on the tv show. he isnt going to choose her anyways. haha, the person he proposes to is going to be a brunette with a blue dress. i think it might be melissa. but i cant remember how dark the hair was. but she had really tan hands
ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	The Legend of Tillamook's Gold (2006)  Starring: Suzanne Marie Doyon, Brian McNamara, etc.  A walk by the seashore takes a girl on the first step of an amazing journey in this family-friendly drama. When her father loses his job and money gets tight, 14-year-old Julie Kimbell (Suzanne Marie Doyon) leaves her California home and moves with her family to Manzanita, a small town on the coast of Oregon. Julie, her parents, Robert (Brian McNamara) and Kathryn (Julia Campbell), and her bother, Jimmy (Brian Thompson), settle in with her grandpa Kimbell (Max Gail), who knows more than a little about local legends and history. When Julie has an unexpected encounter with an elk while taking a walk on the beach, she discovers an ancient gold coin. After telling her grandpa and his friend Standing Elk (Floyd Red Crow Westerman) about her experience, they tell Julie about the fabled Tillamook Treasure, a fortune in gold supposedly hidden in Manzanita in the 16th century by Spanish sailors who used nefarious means to protect their treasure from the natives. As Julie learns more of the lore of Manzanita's Native American tribes, she begins experiencing some of the magic of their people, and sees the friendly elk as a spirit link to the fabled events of four centuries before. The Tillamook Treasure took the prize as the Best Family Feature at the 2006 Newport Beach Film Festival.

What anime or manga do you believe has the best plot or storyline?  >>> Eyeshield 21. (: love it!  It's exciting/suspenseful... The characters are cool... XD... and although I'd never really cared (nor knew much about) American football, now I like it! ... at least in the manga/anime, or when my friends play after we finish crosscountry/track practice.    2. What anime or manga do you think needs to be advertised more?  >>> Eyeshield 21. Same reasons as  1 ( => reason is that I'm currently hooked on this series.. :P)    3. Why is your favorite character your favorite character?  >>> umm I have tons of favorite characters... so, (sorries! [= but...) I'm going to put the top few in the couple of series I'm currently hooked on/currently reading.  -- Koizumi Karin (Eyeshield 21) ~ she is an amazingly PRETTY girl! (: Not to mention, in the manga, she's the only FEMALE quarterback in the tournament, and she's the TOP quarterback in the nine-years-running reigning champions in Japan for high school American football! (in the story, of course.) Plus she can draw and play piano well. (:  -- Kakei Shun (Eyeshield 21) ~ He's just a cute linebacker. (: And he's sensible, at least in comparison to his hilariously goofy buddy Mizumachi.  ~ Wanajima Agito/Akito (Air Gear) -- He's the cutest little kid! At least among what I've read/watched so far. Okay, maybe not that little... he's fourteen, but 142ish cm tall, so I think of him as a little kid. XD And his fighting/riding-on-Air-Treks skills are amazing -- at twelve he was the "Fang King" in the story! (: Although for some reason he has two personalities ("dark side/light side"), that change depending on the position of his eye patch.  (    4. If you were to create a manga, what would you write about?  >>> I'd write something regarding high school. Not sure about the storyline yet, since I don't plan to, but I'd write one with the genres action/adventure/romance/comedy, or something.    5. How many times in a week would you say that you watch anime or read manga?  >>> pretty often. Mostly I read manga... and most times, it's almost every day. (: But I also, occasionally, watch an anime of a manga that I happened to like a lot.    6. What was your first anime/manga and what did you like and dislike about it?  >>> First one was Fullmetal Alchemist (anime), which I watched with my little brother and dad during spring break last year. (:  I like the comedy and some of the cool moves, but after I started reading (more) manga with better art, I came to dislike *some* of the art. Although the anime is still really good. Just not my favorite... XD    7. How many manga series are you currently reading?  >>> lol I'm in the middle of a TON! *counts*  I think I'm currently reading... maybe ten to fifteen. Some I stopped, some are ongoing, and some (the ones I don't read online) I've been waiting to show up in the library.    8. If there was one thing that you could have from the anime world, what would it be (object, person, animal, etc.)?  >>> I'd like a pair of Air Trek (kind of like roller blades), from the Air Gear series. With those, I could get to places so fast, and it would be a lot of fun!... especially since I'd be able to experience the feel of flying... (:    9. How and why did you get interested in anime/manga?  >>> When I first watched the Fullmetal Alchemist anime with my dad and brother during spring break of my freshman year in high school (last year in April I think?)... My dad had borrowed a DVD with 4 episodes in it from the library, and we watched it. We thought it was so funny, we downloaded the rest of the episodes and watched them (after hooking up the computer to the TV.. :P)... Then I checked out the manga section in the library, and eventually I started reading (now a lot) online... and I sooo admire the ones with really cool art! (: and now sometimes I'll also watch anime online too.    10. Final question. If you could bring ONE character back from the dead, who would it be and why?   >>> Shihoin Yoruichi from Bleach, because she's already an interesting character, so it would be interesting to see how she was like as a person before she died and became a shinigami! (lol she didn't die or anything in the story, it's just implied since the shinigami were just ppl who'd previously died.)  lol.. ONE character... that was hard... there are others I'd pick too! ):|`|ybjj5WIhaa	1 Death Note... but it was a bit depressing esp after Light murdered L  2 Hmm....

L Lawliet, because he's too badass to be dead.|`|0p8V1acEaa	1. idk... hard ta choose  2. inuyasha, and ouran  3. because well simply put, he's damn sexy :D  4. ummmmm, my toes... idk I wouldn't be able to write a manga   5. no clue, too much  6. ouran, it's very interesting, it's not the manga I have a prob with.... it's people not getting that the twins really don't have a thing  7. ummm 5+ that's my estimate....  8. OME!! you can ask meh friends, I soooo wanna real life Hikaru  9. my friend was reading ouran and I didn't have a book so I borrowed the first one  10. hmmmm, idk..... Cocos dad (insider)|`|25G5MzQeaa	1. What anime or manga do you believe has the best plot or storyline?     - eh~~~ a lot of them though.... hmmm.... tsubasa reservoir chronicle maybe? its twisting around and confusing but make sense    2. What anime or manga do you think needs to be advertised more?     - Full Moon Wo Sagashite. It is a really good romance tragedy with happy ending manga/anime but not really many people like or know them... sad...    3. Why is your favorite character your favorite character?     - hah? double favourite character? what does that mean? my favourite character for male is syaoran and female is sakura... such a great couple!    4. If you were to create a manga, what would you write about?     - Something magical, but not too sci-fi like harry potter or star wars, with sweet romance like hana kimi... hahahahahahahahahaahhaa    5. How many times in a week would you say that you watch anime or read manga?     - I read manga like every monday-friday. I don't really watch anime often. Just when i feel to.     6. What was your first anime/manga and what did you like and dislike about it?      - My first manga is detective conan. The thing I like from it is that it makes you think and complicated with cases. I stop reading, watching and being a super fan of it when I found the case goes more and more boring and it's like never ending and will never end..... zzzzz....     7. How many manga series are you currently reading?     - Em, loads? hikaru no go, tsubasa reservoir chronicle, gakuen alice, full metal panic!, kitchen princess, xxxHolic .....    8. If there was one thing that you could have from the anime world, what would it be (object, person, animal, etc.)?    - I would like to have syaoran from tsubasa reservoir chronicle in my world and he'll protect me and fall in love with me ^-^ (lolz)    9. How and why did you get interested in anime/manga?    - It is just interesting cause in novels you have to imagine the scene and people but in anime and manga the imagination isn't limited in drawing and we can enjoy the drawing and the story at the same time without burning and killing your brain cell to imagine stuff.     10. Final question. If you could bring ONE character back from the dead, who would it be and why?     - eh.... the clone syaoran from tsubasa. its such a pity that he died for nothing.     So... thanks anyway 4 the poll  ^-^  c y|`|VKRmIj6Gaa	Yo!    1. What anime or manga do you believe has the best plot or storyline?  >>It is a tie between Rurouni Kenshin, Bleach, and Naruto... they are all so original and there is none other like them which is why they are so well known... well... Rurouni Kenshin is a little older so not so much well known but still... Some other good ones are   DBZ  Yu Yu Hakasho  One Piece  Death Note        2. What anime or manga do you think needs to be advertised more?   >>Hajime no Ippo!    3. Why is your favorite character your favorite character?   >>Kenshin is my favorite character because he is sort of like me... funny, laid back, doesn't mind doing things for others, however i'm a little lazier than he is!    4. If you were to create a manga, what would you write about?   >> A guy who finds a sword that is absolutely invincible and starts on a journey defeating bad guys along the way to find out who killed his family and burned down his family's manchine!    5. How many times in a week would you say that you watch anime or read manga?   >>I lose count >.>    6. What was your first anime/manga and what did you like and dislike about it?   >>Dragon Ball or Rurouni Kenshin... or was it Sailor Moon? Either way they all had lots of action and comedy! so yeah...    7. How many manga series are you currently reading?   >>Naruto... and thats it.. currently... but i'm planning on starting to read a few more though..    8. If there was one thing that you could have from the anime world, what would it be (object, person, animal, etc.)?  >>a Zanpaktou from Bleach! I would be amazazing!!! Plus I would get to shout something cool like "Rise from your sleep, [name]!!!" Lol    9. How and why did you get interested in anime/manga?  >>Watching Toonami when I was a kid! Smaller kid that is .. I guess i'm still a kid ... but anyway! Toonami.. Dragon Ball, DBZ, Rurouni Kenshin! I got hooked to those!    10. Final question. If you could bring ONE character back from the dead, who would it be and why?   >>Minato Namizake.. He's awesome and Konoha would be a lot stronger with Naruto and his dad fighting side by side!    Grrrreat poll! ^.^

But I'm sure you could have found better pictures than those!|`|VaA74PCZaa	Johnathon Bennett.|`|V7Y9ldTUaa	JONATHAN BENNETT!|`|FHORWPkFaa	JONATHON BENNETT    I LOVE HIMM |`|pKrsOPOkaa	Oh Wow.!  Jonathan Bennett is HOT-cute.!    Thats the guy from Mean Girls, isnt it.?|`|FxwIu8K6aa	Zac Efron but you chose hot pictures of Jonathan and ugly ones of Zac. But yeah Zac Efron is the hottest guy on the planet.|`|NNtWIICHaa	JONATHAN BENNETT!  zac efron is yuckky!|`|dIkLVWnjaa	LINDSAY LOHAN deal with it|`|QDkdaI0maa	Jonathan Bennet, but I think Zac looks hotter in his first picture[[:|`|jVjXL6HUaa	none of them!|`|TTvTarVdaa	Zac Zac Zac he has the hair AND the eyes. if only he were a wee bit manlier.  and these guys don't even compare to Rob Pattinson!|`|DUqzR7FWaa	zac efron|`|yNXlDuAOaa	ZAC EFRON HE IS FIT AND ALWAYS WIL BE LOL
euZRbiA2aa	Shakin stevens and the sunsets, go shakey|`|gDxMoBl9aa	Aerosmith easily here.|`|nU7yv87Vaa	Definitely The Yardbirds... especially the BBC sessions version (the guitar and Keith's harmonica are awesome).|`|kP0JGI1waa	I agree with you, the Yardbirds version was really quite great.  I guess Aerosmith's version would come in second, its still a solid version yet cannot compare to Page and Beck's playing there.|`|7lDSkGLTaa	Aerosmith and yardbirds|`|ifB3p0pGaa	i love the yardbirds version but aerosmiths version is kick *** also|`|g3hfy9Ziaa	I'll go with the original by Tiny Bradshaw from 1951 since it is so bluesy and pure.|`|zUi3nIPRaa	aerosmith
qOKFuXfLaa	she needs to ride her bike rather than a car  because of her, i have to be more precautious and pray that the ho wont run into me on the streets|`|4VvkJFynaa	I just think she's stupid all together|`|mZUXkeyRaa	Again, it's her life  If she didn't want the car  It's her choice  I personally would have kept the porshe  But oh well, it's her choice  I would kill to have a porsche!|`|WItdtl0Vaa	Well if she likes the Pruis better then, no, she's not stupid. Why can't she have a real car? Your just jealous cuz i bet your car isn't worth half of what hers is.|`|qgE8E70Qaa	No, it's her choice, she didn't like it because it was too big and it was bad for the environment. Personally, I would've kept it but it's what's she wanted...|`|AA10368887	I think she's stupid regardless of what kind of car she owns.|`|pQBjqMkoaa	shes stupid in general|`|PvfhKyFpaa	Ya  she is really stupid she should be sucking my d1ck all night ....... oh wait she does. my doggie|`|wHVdnXJUaa	She was kind of stupid trading in the Porshe...|`|AA10458195	Yes, I think she's stupid.|`|20ffe6Cbaa	lol, true|`|C33jsdydaa	It was all up to her, If she didnt want a porshe her loss, haha  But i do think its "stupid" he parents are allowing her to "date" a 20yr man...
k0Ewe7mCaa	Apparently not. She is also a fictional character, you know.|`|ThdFMIFUaa	That's the point....
q4XUy0Duaa	Yeah, someone on here's answer to every question was Rakim regardless of what the question was.  And it was obvious he first heard of Rakim last week.  I think the dude's name was mesdiva or some sh*t like that.  I love Rakim and grew up listening to him, but damn, get off his d*ck!  That sh*t made me want to never hear the name again.|`|wfZhkZO0aa	I think so.  I respect Lil Wayne and I liked his earlier work (ie The Carter) but his Stans are really making it hard to even listen to him anymore without thinking about them.|`|xeEOTsyYaa	No. It doesn't affect the actual music...    Eminem stans annoy me though...|`|3drMJB1maa	Not really although it does get annoying at times.|`|vFj2GMP4aa	Exactly my point.  I was never a huge Pac fan but I liked his music. When I came on Y!A and saw kids talking like if he was the Messiah and sh*t, I was like WTF? And they wasn't even grown when he was alive.
TTHOXGUuaa	White Zombie/ Rob Zombie|`|iI2XbVjNaa	You're looking for industrial/industrial metal..

tLI94qWNaa	The Craft    Sarah Bailey, a sixteen year old troubled teenager with a painful past and a history of suicidal tendencies and hallucinations, moves to L.A. with her father and stepmother to start a new life - and is enrolled into a Catholic school. It is at school that she comes into contact with three unlikely friends, Nancy, Bonnie and Rochelle, all who are socially outcast with various problems in their lives that they wish they could fix. Nancy, Bonnie and Rochelle dabble in occult practices, and when they notice Sarah has the powers of a natural witch, they talk her into joining their coven. When Sarah joins, they soon realize that with a fourth witch in the coven they can begin to cast spells they couldn't before, and begin to amend all the things wrong in their lives - but like everything else in life - things come with a price|`|nci2WOYXaa	The Craft (1996)|`|rKSs8Wejaa	yup its the craft i love that movie|`|fwIwUqcEaa	yeah that was the craft.  i suggest you to watch sydney white. . .|`|dcb14ffd91b4585af75123db5c4f48a5aa	the craft!|`|4NzQs1jWaa	The Craft.

She isn't really pretty but more interesting looking.  She's a decent actress, though and I, too, loved 13 Going on 30.|`|mZUXkeyRaa	Yes!

dty551Bjaa	I've had my vehicle searched by police 4 times; twice I was accused of being a drug dealer, one cop wouldn't tell me why, and the others' explanation was "that's what we do". Most recently the border patrol thought I was smuggling illegal aliens from Mexico. Of course I did none of this, and by the way, none of them put anything back where it came from.|`|ab1c9b81d36c3691f0d575d773009489aa	yes >.

UP TOP|`|TkCIUNxdaa	I didn't laugh until I cried, but I did have a few good, hearty laughs.

1jpmS3M6aa	I'm afraid no one really knows much about him at this point since he is a character not in the original manga, however I think your idea of him being connected to the three tails is spot on. From that brief flash of the creature it was unmistakably the three tailed demon. However I cannot with any certainty give you any answers concerning Yukimaru as in the original manga the three tails was a roaming beast captured by Akatsuki in the wild, this tying filler characters in with the official story is a way for the studio to boost ratings during filler arcs as surveys show that during filler arcs for shows like naruto and Bleach viewer interest drops as hardcore fans don't care for characters who will have no bearing whatsoever later on in the story.|`|iWXQH1Jeaa	He's a figment of Kabuto's imagination. He doesn't really exist since he's filler.

IFf5r9zAaa	I think it's here to stay. It's survived for 35 years and I think it'll keep surviving. All art forms evolve continuously, and hip hop is no different. We may not always like the direction it takes, but it won't stay on one path forever. Rap will be here until the last rapper puts down their mic and nobody else picks it up - something I can't see happening any time soon.|`|dOurKVdiaa	its just world wide not the U.S. baby no more, the gift and the curse|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	rap has been here now for about 40 years, i think its safe to say its gonna stay. like ANY other type of music will have its "classics" and will also evolve just like any other kind of music. take rock for example, its still around, just changed up a bit. you have the classics and the new shyt.|`|qJ9o3iQnaa	I think it has been established that rap is here to stay.  Like all music it evolves and has come to includes traits from rock, r&b, hip hop, and pop.|`|nAtBuBRhaa	This is the reason why I don't listen to this stuff. This commercial stuff. Once I started hearing that "We the Best!" and all that "Soulja Boy Tell Em!" garbage, I knew that commercial hip hop is gone. It was descent in the early 2000's. But now, rappers think that if they wanna blow up and get paid, they have to make up a dance. It's dumb. I think that real hip-hop is fighting for a comeback. With, Charles Hamilton and Blu stepping onto the mainstream scene. It's gonna take a lot of reparing but I think we can do it. But, if you want to here new real hip-hop, than just listen to underground.|`|NctYwdvhaa	hip hop will go underground with people like joe budden, royce da 5'9, chamilli, cassidy, papoose and crooked i. mainstream will lose its identity until someone comes out and calls out the people who have destroyed hip hop. im surprised ice t didnt call out lil jon, nelly and lil wayne for killing hip hop. i lost respect for him with that, but seriously, everyone is denying that hip hop is gone. hip hop is still around, but these pop acts will continue to prosper because they have no talent and attract many fans.|`|qMrIFglwaa	. . . people always asking if hip-hop be dead . . .    but when did it begin?    there IS fushion-hip-hop-pop-to-the-max BUT    losing its influence? Maybe the question is about relevance . . .     see: "underground"|`|bd1fcb5d764c68e35c6336cba1138542aa	No and no.    Hip-hop sounding "poppy" isn't something that happened overnight.    I don't think it's losing it's influence at all.|`|a02180765517a018eecd133f0f7b2876aa	I think the best thing in the world for Rap would be if it didn't get spins on the radio anymore for a little while because, before rap was mainstream, artists like BDK, KRS, Rakim, NWA, G Rap, etc. emerged. When rap started to become mainstream, but before it was everywere, you had Wu-Tang, Biggie, Tu-Pac, NAS. . . and things were good. Then the record industry started to pay attention, and they molded rap for a more universal audience and you got Nelly, Fifty, Lil Jon and the Eastside Boys, and now, with rap being ubiquitous, you have Unk, Wayne, and Soulja Boy.  That's not to say we haven't seen the rise of artists such as Killah Priest right before Nelly got attention, and MF DOOM (his re-emergence) when fifty finally really emerged but, they aren't typically though of because they've been overshadowed by the mainstream. Hey, 6TH KINGDOM SUNZ SOCIETY might actually get the attention they deserve.|`|SDvs99Ccaa	Well, rock came out in the 60's or something,and got really popular in the 80's.Rap came out if the 80's and is still popular almost 30 years later,so if it lasted this long,it should be alright.

QJPcQ6Wcaa	To tell the truth, I was about the same age when I watched the first Grudge film. I was scared half to death too. The second one was horrible and it made me laugh (the part where Vanessa pisses on herself). The third film is so much better than the second Grudge. Although it did leave me in suspense because of the ending.     When I first saw the Grudge, I really didnt want to go back to my own house until my mom or dad was home. I just said to myself that "its all in my head" and didnt think about it until I thought of something else besides the Grudge. Hope  this helps|`|tZUSVuUvaa	Seriously? I thought the first one was so crappy I didn't even want to watch the second one. Try reading a funny book or watching a comedy sketch on Youtube or something. Usually something that makes me laugh will help me forget about things if I'm feeling jumpy.|`|OtvAUGv1aa	Simple.

Secondly, try and get work experience with an interiors magazine. It doesn't necessarily have to be one of the top magazines, any experience at all is well worth it.    Good luck!
gRwYBmKQaa	HI, I'm from british columbia,canada..and I absolutely luv Silverchair,I have for a super long time.I also am a huge fan of Natalie Imbruglia. Allthough the funny thing is,that I didn't even know those two were married until they were pretty much divorced,because I just got internet last year.The sad thing is that you mention Silverchair out here,and people are like..huh? an if I play them a song they think  it sucks,so I guess I'm on my own with that one.Actors/actresses,the late Heath Ledger (rip),Nicole kidman,I'm simply a huge fan of australia in general,I hope to visit one day,I'm sorry to hear about the brush fire your dealing with right now,hope all gets well.|`|efwvtzitaa	nicole kidman  savage garden|`|qesIBFcHaa	people claim its a dumb movie.     but its based in Australia its called "Muriel's Wedding"    It features some cool actors such as Toni Collette (who is Australian and is one of my favorites) and Rachel Griffiths (who is Australian too)     its a girl who is obsessed with getting married and is obsessed with Abba... i thought it was funny, in fact i own it on dvd.|`|YUaMtlnxaa	Breaker Morant is by far the best Australian movie I've seen.

I7lmPkXtaa	Here's my reply back, and, I hope, it's thought about.    If money were not needed, then how would we be able to determine what things are worth?  Sure, nowadays, we use dollars and cents and other monetary denominations, but, way back when, it was still a fairly common practice.  Certain goods were traded for other certain goods, way back when.    Even some of our oldest records indicate that a monetary forum was available.    Were you aware of the origin of the term salary?  That was based on what Roman Soldiers were paid with, which was salt, but was called, by them salarium.    Many times, people have asked the question of what would happen if money were not in use.  In each time, the answer was (aside from what others would say) anarchy.  How would you be able to determine the price of, say, a pack of gum vs. a platinum ring?  If there were no money, if it was not there, then those platinum rings would disappear very fast.    The idea that everything could be in common is a good one, but there would have to be an overriding control to determine who gets what and how much of whatever is used.  Without a definite determination of what is just and what is right, though, it would be a useless exercise.    Aside from what the long-time cliche says, money, itself, is NOT the root of all evil.  The entire statement is that "The Love of Money is the Root of All Evil."    Here's the final thought.  So, while money is needed, there are too many people who emphasize things that really aren't needed.  Just as an example, although it appears that these new phone products are definitely needed, how much are they truly needed?  Exactly how can it be justified that HD TV is precisely needed, despite just wanted?|`|wz3S190haa	we need a way of life, or life would be boring, we wouldnt have a life, we wouldnt have wants. we wouldnt have presents on christmass,|`|c7GGP3Qlaa	I sorta know what you mean.If there wasn't such a thing as money nobody would be poor.Oh well.It's never gonna happen because that's what everything runs on.|`|CFJzBMwkaa	we would probably go back to trade  like that silk road thing|`|Z2EzfQFvaa	Your right.There is no need for paper money.I like it better as trading gold,silver and other goods in exchange for what we want.Don't listen to Conan..hes a communist if he thinks its better for us to have paper money.|`|NqxDBO2Xaa	isn't that  communism|`|CgP6dYTxaa	http://cinerel.org/|`|otcjMagiaa	Yeah comrade.

Cow with only one nipple is not too bad but who would keep a cow on the farm with one nipple. You are usually good for the slaughter.|`|tokcUJSpaa	Hmmm....

UY3zl9dFaa	I really didn't like it at first. I thought it was like watching a train wreck. No one could mess up as often as that guy! But he is so sweet and tries SO hard to do right (and nothing else starts at that time) that I guess it kind of grew on me. Even the father smiled tonight!|`|gPtU4vvgaa	I do its so funny! I could die laughing watching it!|`|8KbcQGL0aa	I'm not really familiar with it so I don't know if I'd like it or not. Tell me a little bit about it and I may see about setting my DVR to catch an episode to see if I will like it.
DSp8azw7aa	Patterns start very early or set in one's  life, predetermines what will happen to you based on all the things happening around.   Unless the unexpected stroke of luck comes your way, and it is how you make the best use of an opportunity.         You don't let the bad things happen and always trust your own instinct and better judgement.    Know what you want, that's how people who make to the top get there, they know what they want.   Or you have to make the best out your lot.|`|jaAolejUaa	you will eventually die|`|lwii0XCvaa	yeah,   your going to be twice as gullable as you already are nowm for believing in that sh*t

OTFzJbaMaa	when i saw you ask this i clicked on it immediatly because i coudlnt belive what i saw. i avoid her at all costs lol i didnt even know she was still going until this.    let me just tell you when you said "then metallica" my mouth hit the floor so i clicked on it.... let me tell you this and i mean this from the bottom of my heart.. after about 10 seconds i started feeling nausias. right now i actually feel sick to my stomache and I AM NOT KIDDING!     omg i cant take it thats the only one i listened to and it was the first 10 seconds and i wana vomit.. sooooo if shes not trying to, then she needs to quit the business right now because that is just hanious    edit. hhahaha omg i just showed my brother that and the first time she spoke hes like OK THATS BAD ENOUGH  and im liek just listen and he goes.. "its like impending doom"  i think that statement sums up the career of avril laveighn. dont you?|`|gipfVShsaa	She butchers her OWN songs. She doesn't have to try to butcher other GOOD songs. She should be dropped from her record label for covering John Lennon!|`|283tO9j9aa	You should only cover a song if you genuinely respect the artist who wrote it/performed it first. I sometimes think these pop people are just told to sing a song and they do it without even listening to the original- and all these talent shows don't help. If I hear one more decent song destroyed by some silly bint warbling over a techno beat I'm going on a killing spree.    Worst cover version ever: Girls Aloud and Sugababes doing Walk This Way. It just doesn't work with girls singing it, they had to change practically all the lyrics and they added all this weird extra stuff. I love Aerosmith and I almost exploded with rage when I heard this cover.|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Good god she butchered every single one of those.      MA: Panic! At The Disco doing Killer Queen|`|Mx11gL67aa	She's just horrible in general.   Hey hey you you i don't like your screeching!      MA: Hello, Goodbye - Jonas Brothers|`|7B2s7maWaa	Those were bad, but I say this beats all of them.    mq:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HvC6jDrxT...    ^^ Hilary Duff needs to be stopped also. >:||`|mkshF2Pfaa	Ha... Holy sh*t...     Well, after the horrors presented, I looked for her justification... And at least as far as Chop Suey goes, she knows it sucked, they asked her about it, it wasn't even rehearsed...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53QESCU9t...|`|ayS0085raa	i reckon she's just having a laugh at our expense.. :(    MA: Joss Stone's cover of the White Stripes' "Fell In Love With A Girl" has everything I hate in a cover song - overproduction, massively slowing down the original, gender realignment, and the addition of unnecessary vocal "oo-ooo-oooo" warbly bits (yes... that's a technical term!!)|`|0vm66wlcaa	Was this inspired by Shred's answer to my acoustic song question?    Anyways, yes, she should be banned from covering any songs ever. Sometimes I wonder if she actually takes them seriously.    "Children of the Grave" - White Zombie  Maybe. Hard to match Black Sabbath's awesomeness.|`|gDxMoBl9aa	Yes She sucks, I'd still like to have Her for a second Wife however.|`|euZRbiA2aa	Least she cute    http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=bCtiEllPPD...

3dpIt3PIaa	Well, the eyes are a little wonky, but other than that it's great!  *And the eyebrows are different thickness*   (Idk if you intended for it to be like that or not, just sayin')    You're a good drawer!|`|M7E1uIsKaa	ugh... I dont wanna be mean, but it looks like she's got a lazy eye.  Other than that I think its good. It looks like a old sailor tattoo!! :)    MQ:  Yes, it is catchy and REALLY annoying!!|`|MwiBGBK1aa	Holy! Damn that's nice. You got one mighty hand there Zach.    Her nose is kind of flared though lol.|`|DbtS5jzEaa	haha I will judge when I get home!!!|`|cYtHoGaVaa	I think it's really good|`|llNoDDCsaa	Yes! I think it'd make a cool tattoo!    And yes... now i'ts stuck in my head...|`|YwtXSUAdaa	It's lookin ok, once you touch it up I bet it will look good.    Holy sh*t you've been tossing The Academy is... around alot today man, lol.    Now you got me listening to them.... the last time I listened to their album I racked up like 300 plays on my Zune dude, thanks.|`|WTOK5ZOzaa	I like it the way it is.There are some drawings where if you add color,they look horrible.I have one of Jimi Hendrix burning Twilight Monterrey Pop style.|`|GrI8mCJyaa	The eyes are looking in different directions, and the nose and mouth are are too far down (not proportionate distance from eye-line), it makes it look sort of warped. *That's what makes it look 'funky' to me, but if you did that intentionally then leave it, it's your drawing*  Otherwise very nice.     MA: No...|`|MYsSyfQzaa	Dude you know I suck at art!!!!!! I can only tell you that is one bad azz picture!!!!!!!!!|`|4ObhfxoIaa	I think it has to do with the eyes/ eyebrows.     Other then that there really isn't anything wrong with it.  But I understand, eyes are a pain in the *** to make even.    Oh! And the thing on her head, it looks like it doesn't end when it gets to the right side, it looks like it's part of her hair rather then being a bandana or head piece. You have to add more whips of hair to that side.|`|lztLa9FGaa	Still waiting for my squirrel drawing (see other question)    MA: zomg! i love TAI! :) that's a snazzy song too.|`|1vCoaf08aa	Oooh, nice, has a Latin feel to it.

If she has a great personality, then I'm attracted to her.  Likewise, if she has a horrible personality, I'm not going to be attracted to her.  Looks are just the icing on the cake.  So, I guess that means a.    2. I don't care who makes the first move.  I'm not a traditionalist, and my mother filled my head with feminist propaganda, so I believe that any woman who sits around waiting for a man to make the first move is living in the 19th century.  If you like someone, then go make a move, regardless of your gender.  So, I decline to answer this question with either a or b.    3. You forgot "intelligent girl".    4. Screw this 1950s crap.  50/50.  C.    5. Philosophical debate, video game or movie, sex.  In that order.    6. I'm bipolar.  That means poor impulse control and increased sexual drive.

YOvOb0Yyaa	The one where Burgess Meridith is a henpecked husband who wears thick glasses. All he wants to do is read, and she won't let him. Then, after everyone in the world except for him, is killed in an explosion,  he accidentally steps on his glasses. Now he has all the time in the world to read, but he can't see the words!|`|wybNxsu1aa	I like the one with the ballerina, the clown, the hobo, etc., that are all stuck in the drum and can't get out.|`|QvSwo3X9aa	The one where the girl in the future refuses to have her image changed to an officially beautiful one because she doesn't want to stop being herself. I REALLY get that one!|`|fd3969820c20a4244842f433a5e6eee6aa	The one where a person is upset because it is really hot. But then it turns out that she was dreaming and it is actually really cold. So deep.|`|J3iBuHAHaa	The one where the lady doesn't want to go on the bus after she gets hit by a car while walking her dog, because she thinks it's death; but the bus turns out to be life...and she dies.    OR    The one where that girl is trying to figure out who killed her husband, and she wears his glasses and is shown who killed him; and it turns out that it was her...
xebyMvrxaa	every time a new video pops up of the music video, it gets banned because of copyright. I tried to upload mine because i just bought it, and it wont let me. it should pop up soon on there myspace. if you don't want to wait, i would just go ahead and buy it. i think it is worth it.|`|R6oerd5naa	normally things like that show up on youtube in a few days... i was looking for it too. i found a version on youtube... but it was really bad quality.  hope you find it. i really dont know where it would be...
IlNDHC3raa	However many is necessary.  If Lupe feel's like it's his time to retire, let him do what he needs to do.    As long as they don't come out of retirement. Jay-Z p*ssed me off with that one. He wasn't great, but then he retired with a certian legacy, just to come back to rap worse than before on even worse songs.    An artist can take a break, go write a book or something, and come back still, but retirement is a BIG thing. Rappers should take it seriously, and not just use it to sell records.    RHH2: Yes, an artist can still be good, they just won't be identified with a particular sound.|`|IA4x5oPMaa	2|`|6fxr3VBGaa	5 at most you should feel like you have to Bret Farve  after that you should dedicate time to production and younger artist    RHH2- yeah some more lyrical rappers never actually get inconsistent people just lose interest because the type of work they do isn't always appealing to most commercial listeners|`|Mn8xq268aa	If you like maknig posts like this, you should sign up for       http://thenewebonics.com/index.php    where all the members know alot about hip-hop|`|BnTYoxUIaa	8-15 albums|`|kLPaq30Eaa	I don't think there's a certain numerical limit, but when their albums stop selling, they should realize it's time to quit.|`|AA11118643	I don't think there's a definite number as some albums can have a great impact such as Illmatic and is why people still talk about it, but not some of Nas' other albums. Quantity over quality.    RHH2: If you put it like, only lyrical skills to compensate, then they would have to be masters of the dictionary imo.|`|3mHQQeLNaa	well if they r like rely good like t-pain,t.i., bow wow...etc. a lot of albums!!|`|wnbz5gNzaa	Never retire until he work becomes dull|`|yt05KPhBaa	10|`|uXLtG5wwaa	5 at least     Brotha Lynch Hung is no where near retirement and has over 20 albums     RHH2- No that's like in the NFL or NBA you could be the fastest dude out there or the most accurate if you not consistant it doesn't matter just like lyrical skills in Rap|`|HL8W9yU6aa	At least 7      RHH2: Yes...

RVAPQg6Waa	Genesis started out as a five piece band, Tony Bank, Mike Rutherford, Phil Collins, Steve Hackett and Peter Gabriel. They originally were quite theatrical and were one of the original progressive (or Prog) rock band. Steve Hackett left and Mike Rutherford moved over to guitar. They continued on making prog albums, till Pete hit a rough patch and decided to quit the biz (Pete's Solsbury Hill is rocks greatest resignation speech...). So the other three soldiered on (and then there were three) with Phil moving to vocals and eventually abandoning the prog sound for more pop oriented sound.    I prefer the more prog stuff like  Suppers Ready|`|ME4XWNmRaa	Follow You,Follow Me and Turn It On Again are my favorites!|`|a79b8a93426576f5d2c9cb6a23ba338faa	"Heathhaze"  "Carpet Crawlers"    All these albums are FaNtAsTiC!    "Nursery Crime (1971)"  "Foxtrot (1972)"  "Selling England by the Pound (1973)"  "The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (1974)"  "A Trick of the Tail (1976)"  "Duke (1980)"|`|9RTuRPviaa	Tonight, Tonight, Tonight is my favorite by Genesis but i'm not exactly a fan.

If you're into the artsier progressive rock phase with Peter Gabriel then "Supper's Ready" is their all-time magnum opus along with the entire Lamb Lies Down on Broadway album.  I also love "Dance on a Volcano" and "Ripples" from A Trick of the Tail, their first album with Phil on lead vocals.    If you're more into the mainstream commercial Collins-era Genesis then songs like "Abacab," "Man on the Corner," "Mama," "That's All," "Tonight, Tonight, Tonight," and "No Son of Mine" would rank at the top of my list.

xQ8EVDk7aa	Okay, I will take out the Influence from Alice in wonderland.    Nine in the afternoon.  The visual relevance to Alice in wonderland is the video clip to this song. They use clocks. Clocks were used in Alice in wonderland, and was a main attribute to the film. The rabbits says, "I'm late for a very important date" whilst carrying an oversized pocket watch, just like the oversized wall clock Ryan had. Also the fact that it speaks of a time that doesn't exist, only in imagination, Wonderland only existed at a time that doesn't exist either... it was only Alice's imagination.    She's A Handsome Woman.  Depending on what Ryan Ross was thinking... "Grab your hat and fetch your camera" When I hear this line I think of a young man back between the years of the late 1800s to 1930s. Around the time Alice in Wonderland was created... Which I assume... was 1865. I can't guarantee that.    Do you know what Im seeing?.   "Clouds are marching along singing a song".I think of the scene where she meets the caterpillar, and gets advice from him. He blows out clouds of letters. Mainly AEIOU.... Then what makes a small reference towards the rest of the lyrics is "Oh if you just knew what they could do". Normal clouds can't do much. But clouds as letters... who knows what they could do.    When the day met night.  Looking into Alice in wonderland and being a big fan of the fable and interested in knowing the original I recall reading not that long ago that an author who publish "Alice's Adventure in wonderland", had written a poem within the book called 'All in the golden afternoon'. A golden afternoon. Brings the sun, down and the moon up. Between the afternoon the sun meets the moon as she goes down to rest. My opinion on this is that it's during the time of the day when the sun meets the moon. Similar to the lyrics from that book.    Behind the sea.  "A day dream spills from my corked head"... I think of Alice laying against the tree when I hear that lyrics... where she is about to knock out into wonderland. "Left a nod over sleeping waves"... I think of the scene from the caricature version of the story in which she is drowning in her own tears and ends up in the sea of her own tears... they are the waves. "Those watermelon smiles" I think of Cheshire the cat. Big and wide like a watermelon's, and the fact that some watermelons are slightly striped makes it even more relevant to Cheshire.    From A mountain in the middle of a cabin.  For some stupid reason going through the song in my head I think of the scene once again from the cartoon version of the story in film... I think of the bit where she overgrows in the white rabbits house and destroys his home.    Mad As rabbits.  I see this title and straight away think of the two things...  the mad hatter and the rabbit.     --------------------------------------...    Now speaking of influence of The Beatles,  They took small pieces of the music they liked, and gave it a Panic at the disco twist. Surely they do not sound like The Beatles, but they were the inspiration only for Pretty. Odd.   The brass section in Nine in the afternoon has a feel of 'Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band'. Were so starving has a similar chord change to that song.   Anyway, The same way were so starving fades into Nine In The Afternoon, the same goes with Sgt. Peppers going into Little Help With My Friends. They have a similar transition between the songs.  That is pretty much all I can think of.|`|wOc4Dqllaa	The members of Panic bought a vinyl copy of The Beatles' 1967 album "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band," rented a hotel room for six weeks, and played the record non-stop while writing the music for Pretty. Odd.|`|1FBC2dfraa	Im not sure, but I LOVE PANIC!! so much... there was this one band somebody mentioned, im trying to find it.. will edit this question when i find it xD|`|ssoZ33XIaa	If you listen to the album and listen to The Beatles, you can clearly hear the influence.  I know they talked in interviews when the album came out about being influenced by The Beatles while writing the album.  As for Alice in Wonderland, I don't know if they specifically said anything about Pretty Odd being influenced by it, but when I first heard Nine in the Afternoon, that was one of the first things the song made me think of.  If you do a search for interviews with the band on youtube, I know they talked about their influences for the album in many of them.

"Blinded By The Light" was a good song when Bruce did it.|`|OyT5oxFbaa	Yes, when AC/DC's Rock N Roll Train comes on.

RFCcWPliaa	I like both a lot, actually. I'm not too picky when it comes to music. Just no bluegrass/country or r&b/rap. They are kind of hard to compare, however, because they're so different.  The second one (Pretty. Odd.) has a Beatles feel to it, while the first (A Fever You Can't Sweat Out) has been classified as "theatrical rock" by Brendon Urie (lead singer). Pretty. Odd. is on my top three list of albums that came out in 2008.  If you're more into punky stuff, try the first.  If you like the oldies or indie music, try the second.  Or you can just try both. That's what I did.|`|4TN6Erq3aa	they're both so different but pretty odd is my favorite. Every song on the first CD sounded exactly the same!|`|6c7e9e289fd5db36cd934c29dca6003eaa	Pretty Odd was more like the Beatles style which I find a little more respectable.  I would say that one.|`|6TdlNfgeaa	A Fever You Can't Sweat Out is better in my opinion..|`|4ObhfxoIaa	I think they are both good, in different ways. IMO  I don't think you can really compare the two since they're both completely different.|`|VFc9leFmaa	honestly, both albums are awesome in their own ways...  most people prefer AVYCSO because they'd expected Pretty.Odd to follow the same musical direction, which it didn't =)    Pretty.Odd. is obviously inspired by The Beatles, which I think is..interesting and they done well on that...and AFYCSO is actually a concept album...awesome for a young band to debut with such an album|`|L4f5ONEkaa	a fever you can't sweat out thats the panic at the disco i miss and loved now i can't stand the band

I guess I would have to say we must "take it to mattress!" .. he he (if you have seen you've got mail enough times you will get this reference)|`|5kcO165naa	I do!

f2N5Y99jaa	Kinda an on and off thing, just work interaction. Then in the episode "Snow Day" (I believe season 3 finale), they finally get together and after the events of the episode, their relationship picks up a tad. Also, "Snow Day" is the greatest episode of the series.

F0FByGiQaa	What about it? Midnight Sun is just "Twilight", but in Edward's point of view. It isn't really a new book. Stephenie Meyer was writing that when she was finishing up with Breaking Dawn. Stephenie Meyer gave someone one of her drafts that contained the first 12 chapters of Midnight Sun. That person ended up posting it online for everyone to read. So after that Stephenie just posted it on her site so that people wouldn't feel like they're betraying her trust or going behind the Twilight saga's back by reading it. She would rather people read it on her site than going to some other site that had it illegally. She said she would continue writing it after everyone has forgotten about it. I hate when people post that online because it just makes people talk about it more, and that means a longer wait for the book to come out!|`|eMvLctlyaa	yea its soooo good. too bad she stopped writing. thats all there is since it was leaked online without her permission. : (|`|RMppfinbaa	wow, how did you find this???

Andre 3000 - Green Light(MSTRKRFT Remix)    That's a lot of songs, but I guarantee if you take the time and effort to get them you'll be satisfied. There's a lot more where those came from tho, so look in to the artists more and you'll probably find more diamonds in the ruff. David Guetta, Steve Aoki, Global DJ's, Benny Bennasi, all really good techno/house artists obviously.

"2D CGI was first used in movies in 1973's Westworld, though the first use of 3D Wireframe imagery was in its sequel, Futureworld (1976), which featured a computer-generated hand and face created by then University of Utah graduate students Edwin Catmull and Fred Parke. The third movie to use this technology was Star Wars (1977) for the scenes with the wireframe Death Star plans and the targeting computers in the X-wings and the Millennium Falcon. The first two films to make heavy investments in Solid 3D CGI, Tron (1982) and The Last Starfighter (1984), were commercial failures, causing most directors to relegate CGI to images that were supposed to look like they were created by a computer.    The first really real CGI character was created by Pixar for the film Young Sherlock Holmes in 1985 (not counting the simple polyhedron character Bit in Tron). The technology emerged from New York Institute of Technology. It took the form of a knight composed of elements from a stained glass window. CGI did not win over the motion picture industry until 1989, however, when The Abyss won the Academy Award for Visual Effects..."|`|37dbkLvEaa	The first time it was ever used was in the young sherlock holmes film. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Sherl...|`|R5I5Znlmaa	2D CGI was first used in movies in 1973's Westworld, though the first use of 3D Wireframe imagery was in its sequel, Futureworld (1976)    The first real CGI character was created by Pixar for the film Young Sherlock Holmes in 1985  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of...
0QGuWHRsaa	Umm.... really hard question. I really like Charlie (he's really good looking). And Amita's pretty cool too.    My favorite season has probably been season 3 (I actually just finished it, I'm trying to get caught up to season 5). My favorite episode was Season 3 Episode 17. It's called "One Hour" and it's the one where Don is at his therapist, and the team has one hour to find a boy who's been kidnapped.    I'd like to see more happen between Charlie and Amita, I mean they obviously both like each other a lot, but nothing is really happening between them!

Be who you want to be (like for instance his family supported him becoming a priest, but man disco fever!). In his heart he wanted to be a professional dancer plus he was good at the disco.

NJaZBgDwaa	Basically all of Beethoven's works are listed on Wikipedia. I realize that it is not a totally reliable source if this is for research, but if you just wasn't to know about the pieces he wrote it is excellent.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_com...    just to give you an idea of what he wrote,   he wrote:    9 symphonies (Usually listed as symphony 1,2, 3 etc.  Although only four are well known.)    9 concerti (One was a piano version of the violin Concerto in DM - Opus 61)    9 overtures (He really did have a fascination with the number 9, don't you think? Anyway, I am counting all four "versions" of the fidelio overture as one.)    16 String Quartets.    7 piano trios    5 string trios.    10 violin sonatas. (unfortunately, there were 10 violin sonatas. I would have found it very funny if there had been only 9!)    5 cello sonatas.    1 French Horn sonata    32 piano sonatas    30 Bagatelles (This includes Fur Elise)    1 Opera (Fidelio... One could say he wrote three opera's as Fidelio was the third "version" of the original Leonore)    2 Masses (By this I mean the choral music)    3 Major Choral Works (Other than the 9th symphony and two masses)    34 Songs (Including all the songs from his song set and song cycle, and his Lieder.. plus a set called 25 scottish songs)      21 other pieces ( These are mainly works for solo instrument (usually violin) and orchestra. This includes what wikipedia lists as chamber music with wind. 3 Rondos for piano.  One is a piano version of the Gro?e Fuge, which is one of his string quartets.)      So in total 194 pieces...    But of course he wrote hundreds more... like variations on a theme in C major.

Despite it's popularity it is certainly one of his less consequential compositions when compared with his body of major works.  Here is a list of all those published during his lifetime:    http://www.lvbeethoven.com/Oeuvres/ListO...
87wtQbpKaa	This is hard, I both admire them but I'm gonna go with Revolver simply because  even Paul Weller who is by the way a Beatles fan admits that they borrowed the bass line from Taxman. Lastly, you should've added the New Pollution song by Beck among the choices they have the same stop bass line and this time, Beck admits in some of his interviews that he borrowed the bass line from The Jam's "Start".|`|eQtjnKQAaa	TAXMAN!!! :D    Revolver by far!|`|AA11216094	Revolver by far!!!!|`|XyqraJxUaa	Revolver--its one of my faves.|`|394ff47f78f7ed3b7394395aaf14b639aa	Taxman, our first taste of cynicism from the loveable mop-tops    BQ: Sound Affects|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	I'm going with Taxman!

0f35e35fc374dea3ca1e2b585d13080caa	paula is leaving the show. I hate it but it is true. There was a fan who came on to audition who then stalked paula and she was angry cause the show didn't show concern for her feelings, then the out of control stalker fan committed suicide in front of paula abduls home, so she is leaving and her ex roommate kara will take her place next year, I have nothing against kara but she will never get the respect paula has from fans.|`|9rLi9pSRaa	I think they needed a pick me up as far as the show went.  I love it too but the bickering with Simon and Paula was pretty much expected so there wasn't much of a surprise when it happened.  Now with Kara there, Paula isn't so much a highlight like she used to be.  Kara is quite outspoken and although on the first few shows she kind of followed Paula's lead I think she will start to express her own opinions more.  The play- kissing between Paula and Kara should stop.  Its stupid and unnecessary.|`|XnyFEfI6aa	I really hope they don't get rid of Paula. Because she is very fun to watch and I love how Simon and Paula act to each other. I really don't care for the new judge. The show was fine before. You don't fix something that's not broken. If I had to choose between losing Paula or losing Kara, I would defiantly rather losing Kara. Paula and Simon really make the show.|`|8uvb3Nroaa	Kara is a welcome addition and it's nice to see Paula have another girl on her side! This season should be awesome.

If she is chatting when she should be working, and preventing others from doing their job, then her manager should deal with it.  If this doesn't happen, then simply say "Sorry, ------, but I have to get on/concentrate now."    If, however, this is you complaining about her general chat during tea breaks/whatever, then...    Poor woman, maybe that's all she has to talk about?  Maybe she doesn't know what else to talk about - maybe she feels inadequate compared to you?    Can you not all agree to kind of interrupt her every time she starts on this subject, with another topic that you think may be of interest to her?  She must have had a life and an education before her children?  Perhaps bring in magazines that you can show/leave around to give her some idea of what you are interested in and to suggest topics for discussion.    You don't say what YOU like to talk about; maybe (if you're younger or don't have kids) she finds your discussions about lipsticks, boyfriends, what you saw on TV and what you did when you went out last night just a bit boring too....    Someone needs to talk to your manager if this is a problem.|`|en9Xk0h2aa	I can sympathise with you. On Friday nights I work with three older people who all have kids age 21 months to three years and all the conversations revolve around bloody children.    And once I was repeating something crude but funny from a TV show and my co worker said to me "If I heard my Nicola talk like that I'd be having words!" Well I'M not Nicola am I!!    Just let it go over your head if you can, it's what I do. Usually if you keep quiet then you will be included in coversation again. Good luck - I understand!|`|Wodx0yktaa	When she's about to talk, just be like "I have to go to the bathroom" or, "I have sooo much work to do! I should really get started" or "I'm so sorry, but I have the worst headache right now." Hopefully, she'll get the message. or, you could take the rude route and just walk away when you see her coming. Well, that's not rude. Just try to avoid her, okay?       these things work for me. Hope I helped!|`|7aisLVeiaa	Just tell her straight out that you're tired of hearing about them, and change the subject.|`|AA11334101	uuggghhh same at my work, if you figure out how, let me know!!!|`|iEYBCL1Naa	just say, ' isnt having kids so last year' if that doesnt work.. just tell her to give her mouth a rest!! MOTOR MOUTH.|`|851be4fd202aa5aeda766031b3f470a5aa	Your question is not "what shall I do?" but:   "what does my office do to tell her to shut up?"    To do that, you might hurt both her feelings and put her job at risk. But, using reason as to what is appropriate at the time, you could tell her what you feel is proper to the situation.     You could tell her: "If the boss catches us talking, times and again, he might lose his patience and warn us. Better talk about it after the office hours, if you don' mind. I have some urgent work to finish right now.

WELL GUYS USUALLY ST0P GR0WING AT 18;|`|mpGjPV6Xaa	It really depends on you're genetics. If your mom, dad , grandfather, grandmother or whoever in your family is tall, you might be tall as well. Besides, you're only 16, guys grow up to the age of 25 at times. So, don't worry just be patient, get a lot of sleep. Because, if you don't sleep a lot, you won't grow like you're suppose to.    So, 8 hours of sleep every night, if you stay up late at night, stop it and get your 8 hours. That is very important for bone growth, you need a lot of rest.    Hope I helped !|`|QCAiGts1aa	i think guys stop growing at like 18. so you should hope that you grow in 2 years...honestly that's a nice height|`|ZbZw82rOaa	U're just an albino mongoloid|`|zVEHmTcHaa	"do i have a chance of gettin to 5'10'' minimun im caucasian btw"|`|UwFb8cleaa	wats wrong with being with 5 8? im 5 9, and i am taller then most girls, so i dont see why would you want to be a giant?|`|SQIbKAfHaa	I'm six two and fourteen years old.

8yE2sYGeaa	No, for an important reason: how do you want the action to flow.    Unlike most anserican comics, which have six panels a page, manga flows as it needs to and, perhaps, they do not need a panel for a particular action.    Go read any on-line manga (www.mangahut.com can help) and see how the action is set up and paced|`|Q3eeNw4xaa	Huh, that's an interesting request...  I don't think so.

Gv606uKbaa	most people when they try to hit notes out of their range lift their head upward with the note. DO NOT DO THIS. I know someone who did that and got a callous in their throat. They had to have surgery. :((  but also, when hitting high notes try t make them as quiet as possible by opening your throat as if to yawn when you hit the note. But really if the note is too much for your voice, sing a different song.|`|efwvtzitaa	over-stressing the vocal chords. drink plenty of water, esp warm lemon+honey water to soothe the throat.|`|nb8YG7Waaa	Make sure you're sitting with correct posture, not sitting with your neck pushed forward. Try also to take deep breaths and breathe from your diaphragm and sing with support. I hope this helps.|`|KKXNqpTiaa	It is just from straining to hit the higher notes. Just relax, take deep breaths while singing the song and do rest your voice if it hurts more, you can damage your vocal chords from too much stressing. Also, drink Earl grey tea with 2 teaspoons of honey and a dash of lemon in it. NO MILK! Dairy is also not good for the throat. It builds up mucus and flem and then you can't sing to your full potential. Drink the tea slowly so it relaxes your throat. You should feel better.   Goodluck with your singing!

Possibly, Abbruzzese.    1) I love every interview with Manson. Always get some good quotes outta them.

In Jack Off Jill, I hear that the bassist was rude, and always aching for more lime light, etc. [A key factor in why they broke up.]    3) Ewewewewew. I am absolutely disgusted in him now.

Knowing that might narrow it down a bit.|`|ZyGyDLsDaa	Legends of the Fall (1994)  starring Brad Pitt, Henry Thomas, Aidan Quinn, Anthony Hopkins, Julia Ormond  IMDb synopsis:  Set in the Rocky Mountains of Montana in the early 1900s, this is a tale of love, betrayal, and brotherhood. After being discharged, Colonel Ludlow decides to raise his three sons in the wilds of Montana, where they can grow up away from the government and society he has learned to dispise. The three brothers mature and seem to have an unbreakable bond, until Susanna enters their lives. When Samuel, the youngest of the three, returns from college he brings with him his beautiful fiance, Susanna. The eldest son, Alfred, soon finds himself in love with his brother's fiance, and things get worse when he discovers a growing passion between Susanna and Tristan. Colonel Ludlow's favorite son, Tristan is willful and as wild as the mountains. As the brothers set out to fight a war in Europe, suspicion and jelousy threatens to tear apart their once indestructable bond.    That's one of the most famous films about such a romantic triangle. Others include "Sabrina", of which two versions have been made. Harrison Ford and Greg Kinnear play the brothers in the 1995 version, and Julia Ormond once more is the woman two brothers love.    In "John Tucker Must Die" (2006), both John (Jesse Metcalfe) and his brother (Penn Badgley) fall in love with the leading lady (Brittany Snow).    In "Keeping the Faith", they're childhood friends, not brothers.     I'm sure there are many other movies that might fit your description. Arfe there any other details you can think of?|`|OtvAUGv1aa	Inventing the Abbotts?

NZ4iWM9maa	for physical    I prefer shorter women around 5"5 5"7    really C cup or better or a very nice looking B, no flat chested women    smooth skin with as few blemishes a possible not including freckles as long as there are not a ton of them.    I like soft curvy women, no stick figures or girls that have more muscle tone than myself.  Of course by soft and curvy I don't mean fat.    For emotional I like strong independent women..up to a point.

T1l8qYSvaa	Why would anyone trade a nice car like that for a Prius?????? Is she out of her mind? "it's bad for the environment." Give me a break! This stupid going green thing is driving me crazy!(no pun intended),I'm all for protecting the environment,but we still need our cars.Global warming is a crock of s..hit.I like toyotas,but the prius is *** ugly,and I'm gonna piss off all these greenies,and buy a semi truck and drive that around as my everyday vehicle,I'm not even gonna haul anything with it!See how they like that!|`|4VvkJFynaa	That was a REALLY crappy choice in a car! she could have picked something better... like a mustang?|`|a40380daa8f8c7c0761b53d6ecfddb40aa	I don't really care. Let Miley Cyrus do whatever she wants.    If a car runs, I'll drive it-no matter what it looks like! I would drive a Prius right now, because at the moment, my vehicle is tore up. I don't care what kind of car it is, what year it is, what color(s) it is... just as long as it gets me to where I'm going, I'm a grateful person.|`|a8qFkmSzaa	Ok use a search bar please. this has been asked 500000000 times today.     edit: haha i meant with the car thing. not with leo haha. btw i didn't mean to sound mean or anything. sorry if i did :)|`|BgFf4S85aa	She has no idea what she wants! Just like most teenagers!|`|mZUXkeyRaa	She is a celebrity  They can afford pretty much anything  So if she wants a new car, what's stopping her?  What does Leo have anything to do with this.....?  Just get over it  It's her life, let her do what she wants|`|Hp6GLCopaa	Miley Cyrus is just a stupid spoiled brat!!! She wants so many things and she just had her 16th birthday and made a whole bunch of people pay hundreds of dollars just because she is a BRAT!!!|`|E0Ex48Owaa	She has a bf. I don't think she gives a S**T about what Leo thinks at all. She has a sexy guy already, and Leo is way too old for her! Come on!|`|nHHtBGBOaa	ha i just asked this question.she's a brat|`|iZEPEPcBaa	it means, she can afford one!!
Zl8uL8nqaa	Yes, he is. I'm sure we've all had our very stressful days where everyone and everything around you is going wrong (I'm in tech support, and the stories I could tell you..)    But despite the stress, it's no reason to yell at a colleague, especially for several minutes, and in such a rude and personal way.    In such situations the correct response would have been to go for a walk/march for some time until calm, and then in private pull the person aside and explain (calmly!) why their repeated transgressions are driving you up the wall, and that it needs to stop.    I sincerely hope that Mr. Bale later apologized to his abusee and to the bystanders... and I realize that actors are known for being primadonnas, but I've lost respect for Mr. Bale (shame, I loved his movies), perhaps Mr. Bale needs some time off to relax and find joy again/needs to get away from it all to become more human again.|`|AA10081847	The dude is a douchebag, but he's also trying to do his job.  He says during the rant that this is the 2nd time that the DP walked into his shot.  He's right in being pissed, but Christ, he needs to calm the f down.|`|fe1db8f14d601cb36ab6573c97f5f900aa	Actors like him deserve to be taught a lesson. I know it's difficult to say, no one go support his movies but there has to be a way. This guy has to be THE biggest douchebag. He has no off switch, has no respect for anyone and is a meglomaniac. OMFG, was the world really going to end because this guy accidently walked into a scene? Shouldn't it have been the director or the producer who should've gotten mildly upset? Who  the F*CK does Bale think he is? Is he making the world a better place? No, he's strictly an entertainer and WE pay his F*CKING salary. I say we FIRE HIS ***!!!!!!    This just in Christian Bale is a DOUCHEBAG!!! Oh, wait, I think we already knew this.|`|7niWd5Jnaa	Hey look there are two sides to every story.  Sure Christian Bale is a douche bag but you also have to agree that Christian Bale is a douche bag.  Just trying to be fair here.|`|Oh3yVRQzaa	Nobody knows the full story - there are three sides to every one.     People think that actors sit around in their trailers all day sipping on champagne - when the reality is - they often spend 12 - 14 days on set in whatever conditions the movie takes place in - in make up - wardrobe (which can be intense depending on the movie) and it takes the perfect conditions to for a scene to be done right - so when this DP messed up the scene once bofore - I would be angry too.    This guy is the Director of Photography he should know his job (his job listings aren't that impressive anyways - Semi Pro, Drumline)     It is so easy to judge someone else's actions as opposed to our own. I have a bad temper and I know it and I've freaked out on people before (minus all the swear words)     What is important is how the person redeems themselves post their verbal expression. Obviously Bale didn't shut down production - so they must have kissed and made up.     People say a lot of things when they're angry.     Would you want to be fired if you buckled under pressure and let off some steam?      And for the record - it was reported that his mom and sister were verbally bashing his wife and requesting a large sum of money - it was also reported verbal abuse. I would have freaked out on my mother too if she was criticizing my spouse and then asking me for money.|`|mZUXkeyRaa	Lmao  I watched that earlier today  That was hilarious!  He has a bigger ego than I thought!  He needs to calm the hell down!  And get over himself, too!  Douche bag....|`|whE5OQ26aa	He's a prick.|`|VeeS7HJ3aa	I watched that on the show today, that was actually ridiculous, so yeah, total douchebag..|`|pQBjqMkoaa	lol what an idiot|`|29def525b4de3e4f1e95aaabfaa25f77aa	Wow. He's full of rage. He's also full of himself, stooping at name calling and insulting the man professionally. He needs some serious help. It's sad that this man has children. Can you imagine how he vents at home if the wife messes up or the children misbehave at school.

l9lBWiR1aa	I like both eating and sleeping. You know those days where you worked so much, and it feels amazing when you lay down and sleep, haha. And then theres food, certain foods just taste sooo goooood and you can just eat and eat.    Or you can try to do a combination of the both. Eat alot then sleep. But then you gain weight. Oh well, I just do what feels good in my heart! Which is eat and sleep! Haha.|`|qsuYKa3naa	Sleep when I am tired  Eat when I am hungry|`|oVRA1ze2aa	sleeping   I need the rest|`|nXUV9lH1aa	sleeping in.|`|fZ0ECVA2aa	eating it help me get over all my problems fast|`|tDB1UuWzaa	well... my alarm clock is supposed to go of in less than two hours.  i enjoy sleeping - but can't seem to do so these past months!|`|GhsqaXsdaa	Sleeping.

When you're having a rough day, it's a great way to get away from it all and live in a place where you wish you could be all the time. Plus its good for you. When you sleep, your brain can sort out all the information you need and don't need, which is why we have really weird dreams sometimes. Sleeping also builds up your immune system. If you didn't sleep, your whole body can become exhausted and it uses energy on things it doesn't have to, which is why someone can become sick easier if they don't get enough sleep. And you can sleep all you want and not gain weight, as to eating all the time.|`|caExWxHbaa	eaping|`|KRcAwLGJaa	Eating. Food is awesome.

ZyGyDLsDaa	I'm not sure what you are looking for, but here's some information about the movie:    Hangman's Curse (2003)  aka The Veritas Project: Hangman's Curse  IMDb synopsis:  Bullying students are becoming deathly ill after screaming the name of a legendary ghost. What's to blame? An exotic illness? An illicit drug? Or is it the supernatural? The clues are few and time is running out for the students of Rogers High School. The only hope is the Veritas Project, a highly trained investigative team working undercover to expose the truth. Lives hang in the balance as they scramble to unravel the mystery and protect the student body from their own hatred and fear.   IMDb review:  Set in a high school, it rounds out its cast with the usual Goth misfits and the jocks, two natural enemies. A "curse" that sends jocks who also are known as bullies into a coma brings a family of paranormal investigators to a local school.    The question in this film is whether the curse placed by a boy who killed himself is real, or is there a natural explanation for what is happening? Basically, it is hoped that they can find a real, physical reason for what is happening, refuting the supernatural cause in which so many are ready to believe. The battle becomes superstition vs. science, reason (rational explanation) vs. ignorance (belief in the power of a curse). If you've seen the movie, you know science/reason/the rational/whatever you want to call it wins.    I don't know if this has helped at all.

But I sure recall the title.  kudos for you for sitting through it!  |`|fBe2cD42aa	What i loved most about the film was the sudden plot twists.  The last 20 minutes or so were amazing.  Just when you thought you understood what was going to happen, someone else was killed.  I personally like to guess how a movie will end (and most of the time it's pretty obvious).  However, this movie was completely unpredictable and quite a thrill.|`|Inz1ku91aa	nooooo it's a great movie
dDQLlVF3aa	I will answer this questions simply. I've read the series 9 times...      Twilight: bella is 17     New Moon: Bella turns 18 [Her brithday is the reason for Edward leaving her]    Eclipes: No birthday she is still 18 [countiunes on from New Moon after edward comes back]    Breaking Dawn: Bella is 18 then gives brith and becomes a vampire 3 days prior to her 19th Birthday. [ she didn't want to be any older than 18, and they get the cottage for her 19th brithday, but she's already a vampire when that happens]      There was no mistake, if you read the serious consecutivly, you'll understand why it is that way.|`|Tk5a5FQQaa	Okay this is not a glitch this is just where you need to pay attention to what you're reading. Bella is 17 in Twilight and then she turns 18 in New Moon. Since New Moon only ended up in the beginning of the new year and Edward came back Bella didn't turn 19 until Breaking Dawn. You have to read between the lines to catch the whole sequence but other than that this is how it goes.|`|G9sd4Nlkaa	Bella turns nineteen in Breaking Dawn. Not New Moon. She is seventeen at the beginning of the book, turns eighteen in New Moon, then turns nineteen in Breaking Dawn. There is no birthday celebration in Eclipse. Though there is the graduation party, which you may have confused as a birthday.|`|tLC0gDGfaa	she only turns 18 in new moon... not 19 ... what order did u read it in? i know she is 19 by breaking dawn, but i do not remember her birthday in eclipse|`|WUwdDxWMaa	wow i never even realized that but aent the books like supposed to be months apart? so maybe she didnt turn 18 in eclipse and she was just 18 already|`|FSUcbNJgaa	She didn't turn 19 in New Moon.  Remember, she was sad about being a YEAR older than Ed and Ed is 17. And then the book didn't go up until September, which is when Bella would turn 19.|`|Mo0Md3c8aa	Bella is 17 in Twilight, she turns 18 in New Moon,in eclipse she does not have a birthday and in Breaking Dawn she gets turned into a vampire a few days before her birthday.

AA10698792	Rosanne Barr...and what a disaster that was.    Most artists no matter how good they are will lip synch when they perform the national anthem because the acoustics in stadiums make the sound of their voices (and the canned music when they use it) bounce all over the stadium and it is VERY disorienting. Also if they're using pre taped music, often the notes become distorted and the artist will actually be singing off key because they can't hear the notes properly.    Some artists do get a professional monitoring system to help them but this isn't always logistically possible when they're just doing one song and all that equipment may have to be moved before the game can begin.    Other artists are just very good at blocking out the sound around them and singing what they have to, undisturbed, but it's not easy.|`|NIHXUmN1aa	Just shows she doesn't have the chops to do the worldest hardest song live in front of 80,000 fans...if she had screwed it up she'd have been booed out of the stadium and would have been in tears...today's celeb singers are just studio singers...disgraceful lip synching our national anthem.|`|7KRYTaReaa	whitney houston and mariah carey|`|JGjpc7Itaa	Some do.  Mostly the producers don't like them too because it can cause problems plus it can be bad for them if they screw up.  I still thought she was awesome!|`|t0uIgY08aa	she sang live on american idol. :)|`|nLIl1cmDaa	Jonas brothers, demi lovato but with the kiddy singer direction I'm going not Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus|`|6Si3PNsTaa	yeah...demi lovato but she did so not lip sync! it sounded so good because she was singing to her family that got murdered. rip

I even had the doll that came with this little cassette of Britney singing "hit me baby one more time" lol    Im 17 now, and still a Brit fan.|`|3FnhJluuaa	.USED TO BE OBSESSED I used to praise her when i was little but i still love her. Im a fan. so i would say 5-28. I wish those days would come back    I think when i was 6 or 5. When i heard baby one more time.|`|bmwR7RdMaa	probably from 15 to 26|`|biheycXqaa	Well... I became a Brit fan when I was 6 and I'm 15 now, so.....  I still like her somewhat, but miss the old days, you know?

She has some pretty good songs out.|`|bjyX2f01aa	Was 10 when I was starting to be crazy and in love with my sister Britney.. hehe.. Still loving, praying and supporting her.

xSuh1auxaa	Um, well, I'm not really very fond of any of those bands/songs, but here are my suggestions for some very good songs in general.    Bright Eyes- "A Perfect Sonnet", "First Day of My Life", "The Calendar Hung Itself"    Conor Oberst and the Mystic Valley Band- "Cape Canaveral"    Cursive- "Art is Hard", "Rise Up! Rise Up", "Sink to the Beat"    Desaparecidos- "Happiest Place on Earth", "Man and Wife: the Former"    Dredg- "Eighteen People Living in Harmony", "Same Ol' Road", "Sanzen"    Heatmiser- "Antonio Carlos Jobim", "Get Lucky", "Plainclothes Man", "See You Later"     Interpol- "Leif Erikson", "NYC", "Obstacle 1", "Say Hello to Angels"    mewithoutYou- "Disaster Tourism", "in a Sweater Poorly Knit", "January 1979", "Messes of Men", "The Cure For Pain"    PJ Harvey- "A Place Called Home", "Angelene", "Cat on the Wall", "The Devil", "The Piano", "The River", "White Chalk", "Who the Fuc*"    Ryan Adams- "Dear Chicago", "Voices"    the Smiths- "Ask", "Hand In Glove", "There is a Light that Never Goes Out", "What Difference Does It Make?"|`|0vm66wlcaa	Burn Out Bright - Switchfoot  Chaos - MuteMath  Adalae - Pink Spiders|`|sI6m9uQfaa	No they are all terrible.|`|iX3sF45aaa	You're So Last Summer- Taking Back Sunday|`|FURfPEZoaa	Ummm....  Skillet?  I don't know, but these songs are just a scratch on the surface of real music...|`|f2MmEMg5aa	sorry...they all suck.|`|d5q8PvPuaa	I agree with Bdot  that music kinda sux.
DuaaYVKWaa	(I did read everything you wrote LOL)  I'm actually an average teenager who also wants to become a musician(orchestral) and I do know that the music world/business is really difficult to succeed in.   I have talked to my parents and my private music teacher about this and they do support me on the idea that I should become a musician, but they also reminded me that I should have another major in college, like business, and put music as my 2nd choice (something like that).  But when I'm asked to what career I want, I still firmly say "musician" because I want to perform music to people to listen and enjoy.    I think musicians decided to take this path because they have the passion in their heart (and the talent of course lols). They want to reach out to every-day people and inspire them. To remind them to take a pause in their lives and actually listen to music and enjoy the beauty.|`|Pn8SATLuaa	i only read your question, not your lengthy details...  Real musicians don't care about money, they only care about their art.|`|FdaKc4Dgaa	I didnt read all that ?.?    but its there passion and they enjoy it so why not.|`|fE3EDHa4aa	okay in all honesty i really can't read that much at the moment  if i did i think my brain would explode.  but to answer your overall question...  when you love something you can't give it up and there are people willing to go to the end of the earth to get what they want, and those are the true dreamers, that will do everything and anything to get what they want in the world and those people are the successful ones.|`|mTRQiaKoaa	if people really want to do something than they wont care about money|`|9FDAYDheaa	The people who truly care with all their heart about music don't care if they make money, they just want to make beautiful music for people to enjoy and some other people are just ignorant and think they can be like the people in the media
ZzqWzFNiaa	In a lot of cases, loving your job and barely getting by is a whole lot better than hating your job and being successful. Some people just love it enough to have to do it. I've known people like that. For me, I'm content to just rock out with my friends, play live when we can, make records that will never really get any attention, keep it more informal (a hobby that I enjoy a great deal), but I've known people who... well it's just what they do.|`|EQm2iCpaaa	It's a Dream.  Some people work really hard at it.  Some just get lucky and get discovered.  You don't have to be famous to be a musician.   I rock out by myself at home and find that completely satisfying.  If your friend loves music then he should keep playing it and not worry so much about getting rich and famous.|`|pj4agFiOaa	because we LOVE music|`|tuvcxnJXaa	Because no matter how ugly or untalented you are, you will get laid as often as you like.   It really is that simple.

Why don't you just look around Ebay for signed picture of him.|`|2Mvrxdn7aa	sorry, that would be almost impossible unless you knew someone...or iif you have A TON oF MONEY.
FIALhwlKaa	Mmhhhh... what do you think about making a movie about vegetables which want to go into your salad bowl? At the beginning there are the veges at the market... how they "walk" into your kitchen, the knife cuts the veges and the walk to the bowl. Maybe you can film a cat which wants to play with some of those veges and how happy they are to be in the bowl.  Well, not really the big thing... but I cant think of anything else right now.|`|L1qQBNbbaa	follow a pet or a neighbour's pet around and film it for three minutes it will have it's own story whatever it's doing is the story.

Z5mmaFK0aa	ZELDA HEY HUN!!!    oh wait I cant use "Hun" that's now a mortal sin here in RandP and I might get made fun of severely by the ICE WITCHES sorry.    how about? Hey Cutie!!    No I have not done that when I go to post something anywhere it gives me just about every single option on YA other than HERE PERIOD!!    LOL thats okay tho we love all your posts regardless what they are|`|gDxMoBl9aa	Oh yeah, plenty of times. I've posted questions meant for R&P in such diverse places as Botany and Singles & Dating before too, thanks to Yahoo.    MA: Crack The Skye - Mastodon|`|5HvdcWvBaa	Yeah, i've done that!  But i usually just ask in R&P anyway, even if the subject of my question isn't strictly Rock or Pop.     MQ: The Velvet Underground & Nico =]|`|7lCJsp0naa	No you don't have a problem. Sometimes I even ask those types of questions here on purpose because I feel that the dudes (and girls) here on R&P give better answers than a lot of the other sections, but I always make it relate to music somehow.     MA: Gojira - The Way of All Flesh    Yea, I haven't bought any new CD's in a few months|`|DbtS5jzEaa	Hey Zelda....    I pretty much post all my questions here...except only a select few :)    MA: As Cities Burn - Come Now Sleep  From Autumn To Ashes - Abandon your friends    brought them at the same time :) hehe|`|87CAVhs2aa	No. Sometimes I ALMOST post in the wrong section...    MQ: It was... Either The Rolling Stones (High Tide and Green Grass) or With The Beatles... Can't remember.|`|C7YbYUYPaa	I usually just post it here no matter what.  I figure I will get better answers here most of the time anyways.    MA: CD.... hmm, I buy mostly vinyl anymore.      No wait! I bought Journey's new album Revelation when it came out.|`|4ObhfxoIaa	LMAO  I've never done that before.     MQ: I bought this little CD for like two dollars at this show I went to.  It was a sucky local band and I felt bad. I don't know where it is now though..|`|7B2s7maWaa	Yes I have done that before a few times actually.     You don't have problems, when you become used to doing something, sometimes it's hard to break the cycle.  Like posting all of your questions in R&P, it's what you are used to.    mq:-The Airborne Toxic Event self titled album.|`|Mx11gL67aa	Hahahah, I always get "Gardening" as a suggested category  on my questions.     MA: Abbey Road (replacement for my scratched old one)|`|rR6lwxjjaa	yeppp ive done that, a lot actually :)    MA: light this city - facing the thousand|`|RFCcWPliaa	Yeah, I've done that before. I asked a question about tattoos here. Teehee.  Last CD I bought? Uhh, I think it was On The Strength of All Convinced by Daphne Loves Derby. That one I bought today.  The ones before that (Saturday) were Folie A Deux by Fall Out Boy and Where You Want To Be by Taking Back Sunday. I got both of them at a used book store for six dollars! Can you believe it? By the way, I think FOB's new stuff is amazing. Better than before, even.|`|S2ByqJSmaa	No, can't say that I have. I don't usually ask questions.    MQ: Arthur by The Kinks and Disraeli Gears by Cream. I bought them on the same day.|`|Nhjslshlaa	hahaha yeah xD  I asked a random question meant for P&S and I put it here instead.     like obviously the regs didn't mind, but *SOME* people reported my question because it was irrelevant. >:(     MQ: I dunno, i haven't really bought any whole CD's in a while :||`|VFc9leFmaa	no =)   MA: You Me At Six - Take Off Your Colours|`|ayS0085raa	I'm not sure if I've even meant to post a question in another section, not since I found R&P... maybe I should branch out a bit =/    MA: The Breeders - Last Splash (it was ages ago, though.... I need some new albums right about now).|`|V1hxvQukaa	i used to just put all my questions in polls&surveys cause so many people are there... lol.      superunknown- soundgarden|`|e0EG293naa	No, I haven't but I certainly can see where it can be mistakenly done.    MQ:  The new Derek Trucks cd, Already Free :P|`|Ew7hXGFtaa	hahaha awwww Zelda    I have actually never done that. I think it's cause I know to check over and over again what section I'm putting it in since I know I'm not exactly the brightest person. XD      MQ: Nightwish - "Once"|`|YA4qCDukaa	yeah i know what you mean...after awhile i just decided to post it here anyway. here i don't get half the answers about my crappy spelling like i do in other sections. i only get like 1 or 2 answers like that here & there not usually from regulars. so there's that & i just trust you guys more.    mq: janis joplin grates hits   (i have this weird thing that if a cd or record is scratched beyond use i have too replace it, even if it's a greatest hit one & chances are i have all the songs on it....)|`|RKMWeMk9aa	Yes I accidently posted a question for R&P in the Hockey section.    MQ: (Both on Ebay)  Sepultura- A-Lex  Stuck Mojo- Pigwalk/Violated
5EzGvzlTaa	Just like any action figures, a wave would just be a batch of figures being produced at a time. The first wave is the first batch, and the second wave is the second batch.  The figures produced in each wave are not identical, but they will be in the same style. The same exact figure will not be produced in another wave, but a character may have more than one figure in different waves.
lHzBJA4eaa	Because it's not much of an accomplishment.

No one asked me but I sure don't.|`|SDvs99Ccaa	You don't have to have a crime record to be good.But, it's a matter of opinion.It's alright to not like what everybody else likes,in fact it's good.Listen to what you want to.|`|pzVV7VLnaa	Probably, you're the only one who thinks this way.|`|yTCEJRC9aa	no one thinks that except lil wayne|`|3FnhJluuaa	i know right.

No talent at all|`|6c7e9e289fd5db36cd934c29dca6003eaa	Since when does being from the hood and getting caught doing crimes make you the best rapper.  Lil Wayne raps like no other and he IS the best alive right now.  He talks about some things and embellishes them probably but every rapper alive and dead has done that to some degree.  Get over it.|`|1e3e79f5d2afacec16e368695a7510d5aa	He proclaims himself to be.. But sucks ***!|`|ZeKnInbjaa	hype...it's nothing more than hype.|`|biheycXqaa	Rap sucks.  So I don't care|`|lmRjBHOLaa	his freestyles are good but i honestly  think that Cassidy would crush him in freestyling    Cassidy is nastyy|`|ZF02ozgLaa	you dont have to be hood to be a good artist... and honestly most his songs are about weed...... or sex....... but the fact still remains that you dont have to be hood to sound good when you sing because honestly most the rappers from the hood have terrible voices and really bad songs! thats probably why people say that lol|`|4UhSsISBaa	i dunno hes a loser.  eminem owns|`|iLTlJszaaa	Because most of his fans are female upper- or upper-middle class white suburban high school kids who know nothing about rap.|`|x28uz2Msaa	Its the media & the hype.It is like a fashion statement-which will die down.I agree,he is not that magnificent-But hey-Its whats it|`|OkC3uiCMaa	We don't think that he's labelling himself as the best rapper. That's about it.|`|AA10181386	coz hi is not dead|`|Kh4QCRejaa	cuz his songs are great and he sings them well! and ppl just down right LOVE him.lol|`|jr3TcH4Baa	Its cuz these people dont know hip hop! Theyre usually some young kids that dont even know where hip hop came from and originated from! By the way he does have a ghostwriter a guy named Drake from Canada!|`|Vj5iOobwaa	That's a question I often ask myself.     F &K LIL WAYNE.|`|z7ivcj8Maa	sad to say that now a days theres no more real rappers it's all about hype and image if you look the part and sound good while doing it people look past the fact that you're fake . i miss the tupacs biggies back in the day jay z and nas (im an 80s baby lol) so slap on some tattoos and grab a mic seems to be that easy . sad but true|`|W4GwrQP7aa	well he had the biggest sales in america but honestly i don't think hes that great. people like bone thugs and collie budz are the real rappers. in his defense he has a few good songs.|`|lzWFsVXPaa	He ain't the best|`|RFrwwd3naa	Its not about where he comes from or what he's been thru.. its about what he does and how well he does it. He rapps and it all comes from da heart so it doesnt matter wether or not he's "hard."  =/|`|mg3EaEHMaa	didn't he like, NOT write his lyrics before?    i heard he had a ghost writer or something...i digress.    that screams talentless to me...but what do i know, modern day rap/hip-hop is terrible anyways.
cIqpL3tGaa	"I drink your MILKSHAKE! I DRINK IT UP!"    Loved that movie!|`|8e4506c476b48324af970127ad5cd76faa	Great acting and directing.  The soundtrack was also awesome - especially during the opening 20 minutes where there is no talking.    The story is just a classic story about greed and ambition and how a man can achieve material wealth and yet still have nothing that matters, really.  Pretty standard stuff.  Same theme as Scarface.  I'd like to see the movie where the guy becomes rich and is actually happier for it - will that ever be made?  Overall, it was a great American movie (9/10).|`|tLI94qWNaa	I loved loved that movie so much, it is one of my favorite dark comedy's.  My number one favorite Daniel day lewis films of all time.  The film meant possibilities to me.  There is so much to this movie, so much meaning behind it.  Just an excellent film in general.|`|6c7e9e289fd5db36cd934c29dca6003eaa	I thought it was great.|`|7fXpLlhBaa	Very very long, but amazing. The acting was incredible and the story was equally awesome. It was simply an great American movie.|`|RT9JlTlRaa	Just watched it the other night and said to my husband, "I'm not sure I'm glad I watched that."  It was scary and depressing and the characters were so loathsome!  I would grudgingly tip my hat to Plainview just because of his incredibly uncompromising honesty--if it weren't for his brutality and anger.      I lay awake in bed afterwards, more or less praying that I would find a way to teach my children kindness and gentleness and that I would convince them that these qualities are far more important than any others.      As for the movie, though, it certainly is a searing and timeless exploration of the tension between our need for relationship, for brothers and children and for the things we find in faith--redemption, forgiveness, community, purification--and our drive for success, gain, and accumulation.  It made me suffer and soul-search.  Probably a good thing in the long run.  It also struck me as an honestly-made film.  With the harshness of the story and characters fully reflected in the cinematography and the soundtrack.

a3C6DeNeaa	Cut-out would be the easiest if you don't know anything about how to do it digitally. But you don't need to do CGI to do it digitally. Just create the image in a digital image program like a photoshop, where the viewing area is transparent. Save the image as a format that can maintain the alpha channel (transparency), like PNG. Then just import that picture into a new video track in your video editor.|`|8e4506c476b48324af970127ad5cd76faa	Put a cut-out in front of your camera.  Or add it with computer generated graphics.  If you don't want to buy the software for CGI, you better do it with a cut-out.

a55ddab29f572dabb9494ff9fd59acc1aa	1) It really depends on how many songs you want if you talking the normal 15-18 then yeah use a CD-R.  2)If you making one you might as well use up all the space.  Depending on each song size 15-18 probably.  Maybe more if some of the songs our short.  3)Whatever mood your in.  You might want to start with something soft and build up or go with something hard from the beginning.  Its a mood thing.  4) If your going to give it to someone and what to explain what mood you were in and what you were thinking about while making it they sure add one.|`|reNnLWh4aa	1, yes cd r  2, as many as you can possibly fit with a one or 2 second gap in between each song  3, yes make them flow into one another if possible. up beats songs with up beat songs and vice versa.  4, not really, but you may just want to include some comments here or there on the case... it really depends on who you are making it for. you know your audience better then these people.     Good luck|`|1e3e79f5d2afacec16e368695a7510d5aa	1- Yup  2- No more than 20. at least 10  3- Yes, it has to flow  4- Not really, but it can be a plus

They're mostly really cute and adorable - I'm currently in the midst of watching Vampire Knight and I'm really enjoying it.|`|POXOqhOYaa	Hey Rene15, :)    Here are some of my suggestions and perhaps you'll enjoy them.     -Tokyo Mew Mew-  This series is about a girl who has her DNA infused with a cat. This anime is about her love, her friends, and how she has to protect Earth.  There are 52 episodes.    -Onegai Twins-  This anime is about two girls and a guy. The two girls want to know who their parents are and the only clue they have is a picture of this house that the boy owns. This story is about the events they go through to find out who they are and how they fall in love.  There are 12 episodes.    -La Corda Doro-  This anime is about a girl who gets a magic violin. There are about five guys who like her and the anime is all about her (and the guys) playing their instruments at this contest. I was a little disappointed because no one ever really confessed their love and nothing actually romantic happened (like kissing).  There are 26 episodes.    -Zero no Tsukaima-  This anime is set in a world of magic. Each magician calls a pet to themself. These pets are called familiars. Louise, the main girl, calls her pet and it turns out to be a human boy. This anime is about their adventures trying to get him home and how they fall in love. There are 3 seasons.  There are 13 episodes.    -Ultra Maniac-  This is about a girl who uses magic and her good friend. It is about the girl trying to win this competition to be the wife of this magic prince. The girl is really in love with this boy from her school. It is also about her best friend being in love with this other guy.  There are 26 episodes.    -Crescent Love-  This anime is about a princess from the moon going to Earth to help make peace. The story revolves around her falling in love with a boy from Earth, and their struggle to make peace and be together.  There are 12 episodes.    -Elemental Gelade-  A boy who works on a flying ship meets a girl who can turn into a weapon. They encounter many enemies who want to use her, and they fall in love. They make new friends on their journey to a place called Edel Garden.  There are 26 episodes.    -Romeo and Juliet-  This anime of course is the story of Romeo and Juliet told a little differently. Romeos father rules Neo Verona which is like a floating island in the sky. Juliet was like a masked hero who stood up for the good, but she eventually had to give that up. Juliet wears a wig to hide her long hair. She has to pretend to be a boy because people would find out who she is if she didnt. Her parents were killed by Romeos deranged father. There love is very sweet throughout the anime. Sadly I have not seen the ending  I cant wait. It might be a sad one though.I hope not  There are 24 episodes.    -Da Capo-  This is about a girl who is adopted into this family and she is in love with her brother.  There are 2 seasons with 26 episodes in each one.    -Kamisama Kazoku-  This anime is about gods son named Samatarou. There is a girl who is an angel that is always with him and she loves him but he likes a new popular girl at school. Samatarous mother is Venus and his sisters are both goddess candidates.  There are 13 episodes.    -Kamikaze Kaito Jeanne-  This one is about a high school girl who is a thief that steals art usually because it is made/possessed by a spirit of the devil aka demon. It is about how she meets another thief and falls in love with him.  There are 44 episodes.    -DN Angel-  This is about a boy who has a famous thief named Dark who is basically appart of him. Whenever the boy looks into a picture of a certain girl he transforms into Dark. Dark steals art work to seal away evil things inside it. This anime is also about the main boy being in love with this girl.  There are 26 episodes.    -Gakuen Alice-  This is an anime that is about a girl and her best friend at first. This girl named Mikan finds out her best friend is leaving school. Basically, Mikan follows her friend by going to her new school. This school takes in children with special abilities which they call Alices. Only children with Alices can attend, but the school allows Mikan to attend. This anime is about Mikan and her adventures once she enters the school. This anime reminded me a lot of Kodocha (kids who are in love). Nothing romantic actually happens (no kissing, but in the manga they do kiss). If you watch all this anime and you want to know more, I would recommend reading the manga (which is ongoing).  There are 26 episodes.    -Peach Girl-  This is a series I really liked. It is about a love triangle mainly between the main girl and two guys. The main girl named Momo has tan skin and bleached hair because she used to swim a lot. Since she has these features, people think she is promiscuous. One guy plays baseball and the Momo has liked him since junior high. The other guy was saved from drowning by Momo. Her best friend (not) named Sae is evil. Sae tries to mess up everything Momo has (especially her relationships).  There are 25 episodes.

I like B.|`|tlLoQUsuaa	A couldn't be true.  its impossible.  so B :]|`|biheycXqaa	Okay.... they are not gay, first off.  And second, two of them actual are considered men because they are legal adults!  Get a life|`|B3N388wBaa	Haha, answer choise A made me laugh    They're not men. They'll never be men!  And I'm surprised that they know the word homosexual! xD    How about C.

And it's also A, 2 of them are legaly adults, so ha|`|iNKnyj7Qaa	This isnt funny.    They aren't gay. They are Christians and I have never met any Gay Christians in my life. And I am one so I should know. Leave them alone and mind your own buisness.    Now that's clear up    Selena is out "peace"|`|3TT2ErHZaa	C. Because they are straight. They all have girlfriends, even if they are gross like Miley.|`|yJd1WwF2aa	they're boys so it can't be A so it has to be B, but you know what the truths a b*tch
JHOlfb1jaa	I'd be the one pushing the b*tch lol...|`|gWLhIoIiaa	you all are some damn liars. i asked a question if miley cyrus died and no one said they would be happy. the harshest response was something to the effect that they wouldnt care but certainly wouldnt wish death on her. but now all of a sudden the consensus in here is that people would cheer? yeah right.    if she did do such a thing you would all come in here posting "RIP MILEY" every other question|`|k39bNUgeaa	Your wrong about your number    90% of people would yell "jump *****"    10% would have the breakdown    she doesn't have many fans anymore  I wouldn't be sad|`|a1ab7277290c15626a6cb8a25ffa3fb4aa	I would care if she jumped for one simple reason. In ten years, no one will even remember who miley cyrus was. HOWEVER, if she died young, she would gain a legendary status. Look at Aaliyah! Can you imagine miley cyrus' name being uttered in the same list as Jim Morrison, Janis Joplin, Kurt Cobain, Mia Zapata, etc.|`|nAKOfHNGaa	she is just doin her thing .........and i wouldnt care really if ANYONE jumped off a bridge as long as they didnt blow it up and kill anyone that didnt want to die|`|mPIOOUtDaa	My friend got that on a Text and even if you don't like her thatas mean because seriously what would your life be without her?

And you are thinking why in the world am I answering this? Don't waste 5 points on a girl who is still learning from her mistakes. She's has a future and you can't predict it will be slutty, so think again. She has a whole lot of life in front of her and if she ruins it, she ruins it. Particularly, no I wouldn't care because she's just a celeb and I don't know her personally? But I would feel bad for her and her family. No person deserves to die for taking pics of them or showing a bad influence!|`|9OBjjP2aaa	yea but i dont even like her but still she doesnt deserve 2 die duhhh

Advice: Everybody wants to land a voice acting job even just once for fun. But it's easier said than done, unless if you have some really strong connection to the company you will need plenty of practice and hard work in order to pass the audition. To be honest your chances of getting a regular acting job in some play may be higher. I am not saying that you can't do it, but you should try to start small and work your way up.|`|M8YMxfEVaa	Hi, I think that you should go to google.com and type:  Anime voice actor.

edd92ad764d0c8774472bd25d0b6aa88aa	Some men like a woman that is not a stick. Curves are beautiful and feel great to the touch. Going back to prehistoric times you see the "Venus Idol" figurines in many caves. Hips and breasts are what genetically compel men, they are an indication of fertility.

v5YBydCGaa	Well for modeling it's the BIGGEST SCAM in the world since you don't pay to become a model. I don't know about acting though.|`|r0XWK4cUaa	Barbizon is absolutely NOT a scam. I am currently a student at Barbizon ,San Francisco.  Barbizon will get you a few auditions as they promised, but getting picked and earning a role for whatever you are auditioning for is absolutely up to you.  If you KNOW that you have the guts to do this, if you know you have the talent, then Barbizon is definitely worth the money.

I also listen to worship songs, but i'm not sure who wrote what, exactly... ):  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++...  BONUS (combined in each category)  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++...  bonus: you are working at your job/ dream job and there is a huge line up of people at you staion waitng for your help. Your favorite anime charrie/ anime crush is at the back of the line and is getting impatient. Do you    a: Have Him/ Her go to the front and risk everyone else leaving  b: call/ text him/her and tell them to wait a bit longer  c: have them wait and hope they don't leave  >>> B. If I'm a doctor, I can't risk the other people's lives even if I'd like to, for my favorite anime character/crush. He can wait a bit longer, unless his condition is more life-threatening than the rest.  After all, doctors have to be responsible, right? Otherwise our world would be in a pretty sorry state! That would be bad.

K9X0q7Whaa	Actually there are very strong rumors as well as talks from the actors and writers that there will be a third movie.  If not a few more animated ones.  There are even talks of bruce cambell filling in as lobster johnson.|`|QYwbPBtCaa	I doubt it, Hell boy 2 wasn't as good as the first one.|`|AA11640951	While it's possible someone else may pick up the franchise, Guillermo del Toro ( who was director or producer on Hellboy and it's animated spin-offs) is currently wrapped up in the two "Hobbit" films, so it's not likely he's going to make another Hellboy film for several years.

rjxMejAMaa	Well it depends. I didn't know whether or not that 'nor' in the second clue was a typo.    If it's supposed to read "Sarah said that EITHER she OR Laura robbed the bank," then it goes as follows: Laura robbed the bank. Laura, Larry, and Jake are lying, since neither Sarah nor Jake robbed the bank, Matt was right in the first place, and Sarah was right.    If it's supposed to read "Sarah said that NEITHER she NOR Laura robbed the bank," then it goes as follows. Laura robbed the bank. Matt, Sarah, and Larry were lying because neither Sarah nor Jake robbed the bank, either Laura or Sarah robbed the bank (and it was Laura, making this statement true), and both Larry and Sarah were therefore lying, making Matt's claim false.|`|UsTbHM0Taa	Jake robbed the bank.    Laura and Sarah told the truth.    Larry and Matt lied.
GvJOyiodaa	November 3 1986   8:46 PM    Rising Sign is in 08 Degrees Cancer   Very sensitive by nature, you prefer to be in your own familiar surroundings. Cautious and conservative, you make changes in your life only very slowly, if at all. You do not open up easily to strangers. Friendships are made for life, however -- once given, your trust is forever. Your mother, your home as a child and your early family life in general are very important to you. You are also very sentimental. When you feel self- confident, you are gentle, giving and protective of the needs of others. But when you feel insecure or threatened, you become overly sensitive to criticism, shy, withdrawn and moody. You have a strong need for security -- in the sense that you are being loved, nourished and protected.     Sun is in 11 Degrees Scorpio.   Intense and complex by nature, you have extremely strong emotional reactions to most situations. Feelings are often very difficult for you to verbalize. Therefore you have a tendency to be very quiet - - to brood and think a lot. You seldom get overtly angry, but, when you do, you are furious and unforgiving. When you make an emotional commitment, it is total -- you are not attracted to superficial or casual relationships. If you are challenged, you take it as a personal affront and tend to lash out and fight back in a vengeful manner. You love mysteries and the supernatural. A good detective, you love getting to the roots of problems and you enjoy finding out what makes other people tick. You are known to be very willful, very powerful and quite tenacious!     Moon is in 06 Degrees Sagittarius.   An idealist, you prefer the grand, the beautiful, the good and the noble. You get very disappointed when your high expectations in life are not met. Very curious by nature, you enjoy traveling and learning about other peoples and cultures. Try to avoid your tendency to ignore the small but important details of living. You are independent and free, and you want others to be that way, too. Optimistic, buoyant and cheerful, others like to have you around. You have an incessant desire to learn as much as possible about metaphysics, religion, philosophy and any other broad, deep subject. Your life tends to be punctuated by bursts of energy and frenetic activity.     Mercury is in 28 Degrees Scorpio.   You are a born investigator. You are fascinated by secrets and mysteries and unanswered questions of any kind. When you become upset or angry, your emotional reactions are overpowering -- reason and logic disappear in an uncontrollable passionate outburst. You tend to keep your thoughts secret and bottled up and this makes others regard you with suspicion. It is not that you are trying purposely to be evasive, it is just that you would rather not deal with the explosions and hassles that often occur when you reveal your true feelings and opinions. Your sense of humor tends toward sarcasm and irony.     Venus is in 13 Degrees Scorpio.   Your feelings about others are deep, powerful, intense and complex. When you like someone, you do so totally and obsessively if you do not like someone, they do not exist. Your faithfulness and loyalty to your lover is unquestioned, indeed at times it is too much so -- you get so possessive that you almost smother your partner. At times, your feelings are kept deep within you and, because they are so complex and intense, they frighten you -- this is the way that you try to ignore them. But the more you try to do this, the more explosive things get when you eventually do express them.     Mars is in 15 Degrees Aquarius.   Your ideas and opinions are usually inventive and original, but sometimes they are merely eccentric and offbeat. You are altruistic -- you will work hard for the attainment of group goals, as long as they meet your high standards. You tend to resent traditional authority figures because you think that your ideas are better thought out and more valuable than theirs. Very idealistic, you are a rebel WITH a cause!     Jupiter is in 13 Degrees Pisces.   You are at your best when you give of yourself and what you have -- try to avoid being a martyr about it, though. You're a true idealist, but you must learn not to be upset when life does not cooperate with the way you think things should be. Very concerned with spiritual truth and growth, when you practice what you preach, you make an excellent role model for others. You are so devoted to altruistic ventures and concerns that you tire easily at times. It then becomes necessary for you to go off by yourself to recharge your batteries.     Saturn is in 08 Degrees Sagittarius.   Basically quite conservative, you respect traditional authority figures and are very thankful and supportive of the laws and institutions which govern your life. You learn and accept new ideas only after having very thoroughly examined them. Ideals and abstract concepts are important to you only if they can be used in some practical fashion. You are so|`|LrKCLZF7aa	No one likes people dangling points in front of their face. Especially when you are asking for help. Even with the information you gave it's still not enough to get your placements because without the place of birth we are not able to accurately place the ascendant. Therefore the house placement would be off. You can look up what each planet means in each sign and still not get a good understanding of what they mean. My suggestion is that you become a serious student of astrology instead of trying to employ pros at a measly 10 points a reading. It requires no research for me because I already know the stuff. But it does require time and effort.
uKpWUPEUaa	Kyrie Eleison  idk if that's contemporary  XD  but it's a really beautiful song.|`|2bkS1VIIaa	i like fur elise. also you can try a lot of songs from Vanessa carlton like a thousand miles and white houses.
lpyWVR2oaa	All Air signs seem to have a fear of commitment because Air is the most versatile, changeable element in the zodiac and they need a lot of personal space and freedom to navigate in their social environment.    However, of the 3 Air signs, Aquarius is Fixed Air, which means that it is likely to have the best staying power of all 3 Air signs. Fixed Air is stubborn and can be loyal to a fault...although if boredom sets in, they will not hesitate to leave.|`|dNrpkObwaa	who doesn't change when in love?    aquarius|`|PCAlAoDsaa	Aquarius are loyal. They like to analyze a situation over before making a commitment or getting into a relationship with the person that they love.|`|2VNmxfgpaa	Air signs don't indicate infidelity.  Air means more intellectually led than emotionally.  Scorpio is the biggest player in the zodiac, and being ruled by fiery Mars though a water sign, let me say that if you're worried about getting burned, I'd be more worried about fire.  Sagittarians can run around, Aries are loyal (if they're on your side :-) and Leo can be treacherous.    As it happens, I've had Aquarian best friends, I have an Aquarian life partner, and a parent is Aquarian.  They have all been absolutely loyal and true-blue.  They have diverse, changing interests, and are full of a fun, nutty sense of adventure.   When it comes to people, they use their sharp minds and ability to *think 50 years ahead* to choose their partner and friends, so they don't stray.  True-blue.|`|ntj9WfzYaa	No, but they're boring as sh**t.|`|l3b0hjdWaa	loyal once they feel like they can be vulnerable

ybVzFAhHaa	It's the number of crests in a sample of a sound. Like a high frequency sound might have 10 times more waves per second than a low frequency. All this means is that the high frequency sound will be higher pitch.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Aye dios mios, que lastima|`|AA11717111	Speed of rate of the vibrations.    In other words, the pitch.
AA12390047	Jillian.  I hope it's Molly too, but Jillian seems to have wiggled her way into his heart.  The hometown dates will tell a lot.|`|Ukgl64pSaa	Melissa or Jillian|`|7d96b4f24578cd2c4b4f5474341984afaa	I hope it is Molly.    BUTTTT I am thinking Stephanie.  He seems to really mesh well with her, plus her little girl and his kid could play.|`|lAjnRFSVaa	what u talken about|`|tguEmxVyaa	Jason will marry Ann.|`|MzWiGnqdaa	Find a hobby or buy a cat...    stop watching these ridiculous shows!|`|joa30mM8aa	I hate jason...cheesy smile and fake laugh to everything....but yet I still watch...yeah Molly|`|b86b601e857ab3f32e2405d77431eaccaa	I heard it's Melissa.  I hope so!!  Stephanie is gone, thank God!!!|`|XnTdmC5Naa	I really really really thought it was going to be Jillian, but after tonight I have my doubts.      However, if you watch the final rose ceremony previews, it looks like Melissa. But not official.      I will just say that Jillian looks the best with him while the other 3 are the girls who like to go out on Friday night while I am sure Jason is looking to settle down.|`|AA11546509	I actually KNOW that it will be Melissa. These people did a screen capture of the preview where it shows him proposing and they zoomed in and made the picture super clear and the saw some birthmarks on the woman's forearm and they matched them to Melissa so it's a fact, he chose Melissa.|`|lvTJ8miHaa	I think it will be between Melissa and Jillian, and I hope its Melissa. She seems so much more natural with him.|`|0f35e35fc374dea3ca1e2b585d13080caa	I love molly and mellisa. I don't like Jillian, she is playing the game to win she isn't looking for love... as every year on the bachelor there is always one like her and she does not strike me as the mommy type.  Naomi hasn't matured yet. Molly and mellisa have both shown him they are falling for him, surely he is smart enough to know that.|`|AA11608168	I've seen a ton of spoilers and it is Mel.  She wears a pinky ring and in the proposal, it shows a girl wearing one...and Mel is the only one that did on the whole show...well Steph did once, but she is gone now.  And like someone said before about the birthmarkings...it is Mel.|`|j4xGHJTcaa	I've liked melissa since she stepped out of the limo. like ALOT. So I definitely want her to win. But, I think he has a real connection with Jillian. I didn't like stephanie at all, I dont think there is romance between him and naomi, and I just dont like molly, i think she acts very fake, but I think he seems to really like her.|`|VgCEapGDaa	He doesn't choose Molly.  I know this for a fact.|`|2O3fT4neaa	marrisa i think s my favorite, for some rason i liked shannon's charater alot so i was pretty sad when he didnt give out the last rose|`|CLXTxsoqaa	I want it to be Jillian so baad, but I think it's Melissa.

dCewrtXaaa	It is obvious that marihuana is your "equal opportunity destroyer" of choice, rather than booze. You would rather grownups would take a more lenient attitude to your particular vice just because it would enable your psychological addiction. But the truth is that marihuana is far more harmful to your life overall. Not only do you get "wasted" (an appropriate word for what it does to your potential), but you also expose yourself to the risk of arrest, a police record and eventually prison, depending on how stubbornly you cling to your escape from reality. A mind is a terrible thing to waste, and if people point this out to you, it is not because they are moralistic, but because they hate to see an otherwise smart girl go down the tubes.

x5CBdBdJaa	Sam:   details: she's an only child. She originally stole from Brooke, thus causing a hatred between them, but Haley thought Brooke could be good for Sam so she cajoled Brooke to take her in.  Her mom works at a diner and gave her up when she was younger, and she's waiting to tell her she made a mistake by giving her up.    The Nanny Carrie got killed, hopefully, we don't really know she might be like psycho derek (he can never die!!!). She came back to kidnap Dan, and he got away when Haley and Jamie went to the house under the impression Dan was dying.  Nanny Carrie trapped them, and tried to kidnap Jamie. You find out her baby died when she was younger and that was why she wants Jamie so bad. She goes after Haley and Deb comes by to shoot her. She comes back to life just in time to get shot again by Dan. hopefully dead.    Nathan got a chance by inflitrating pro basketball try outs. The manager of the team knew who he was and gave him a shot. He also played with Owen on Slam Ball, but that was shortlived|`|eMvLctlyaa	wow kid, you miss ALOT.. um summary..    brooke has become sam's foster child bc she was living on her own.  nanny carrie is dead after almost killing dan and kidnapping jamie again.. deb  knocked her out and i think dan shot her..   nathan just kept going to tryouts after he played slamball..  so yea.. you should read the episode guide at tv.com|`|gWmX70KNaa	ha okay sam is like this orphan girl and her parents are who knows where. shes a student in haleys class and she found sam sleeping overnight in shop class (cause shes always in and out of foster homes)  and haley asked brooke if shed be interested in caring for sam since brooke had wanted a kid.    and carrie..yeaaa she got killed lol. she hit dan with a car and kidnapped him and held him hostage. and she was going to make him help her get jamie. and she was close..but when she was chasing jamie and haley around in like a corn field (her house was like on huge land) and she was about to get hayley i think with like an axe and dan shot her. but thats whole thing is kinda another story hard to explain.    and um nathan..well he got offered a position to coach with that team (from that blonde coach guy) and he turned it down  then eventually he got a call to go to tryouts for that pro league and yeaa    :) hope i helped!

KBBonf97aa	Good choice going with Ibanez!  I've got five Ibanez instruments (two acoustics, two electrics and a bass) and the quality and sound are better than those of instruments costing twice as much.    Guitars are very personal and each has its own "feel."  I recommend you visit Guitar Center or another music store and test drive a bunch of them before making your decision.  The width of guitar necks varies greatly and you'll probably want a thinner neck for your first guitar, since thinner necks make it easier to fret the strings and move quickly between chords.  Ibanez guitars tend to have fairly thin necks, but some models are definitely more user-friendly than others.    If you're still a kid or have really small hands, don't rule out a 3/4 size guitar.  Ibanez has a model called the Daytripper that's a slightly smaller than full-size guitar that plays fantastically and sounds great.  I normally play a full-size Ibanez acoustic/electric, but got a Daytripper to take with me when I travel.  It's such a great player, I pick it up just about every day.  And my brother, who owns a recording studio, liked mine so much he bought one to use in his studio.    I'm sure you'll be completely happy with whatever model you choose.  But if you try a bunch of them before deciding, I'm sure you'll find some just feel more natural in your hands than others.  Trust your instincts.  If you want to do some research, go to the Musician's Friend website (musiciansfriend.com).  If you click on guitars, then on acoustics, and then on Ibanez, you can see all the current models are read reviews written by customers.  The reviews have been a great resource for me when I'm narrowing my options.    Good luck!|`|dstvm3zRaa	they have one called the Tillman and its 199 @ musicians friend.com. check some of those on that site and choose

AA11613198	I love that show!  it is SOOO funny. I love shawn and gus, they're both so hilarious.  the references are so good and hysterical. I love the obscurity.  I totally wish i could see little details like shawn can!  And i love Jules and shawn, their whole sexual tension thing.  I doooo love that show!|`|UNsb8weaaa	I LOVE this show!!! My Mom and I watch it all the time. It's funny and Shawn and Gus have really good chemistry as friends on the show together. It's one of those shows that isn't very serious but creative at the same time. It's a nice break from all the serious detective shows. I loved when they do random things...like put the picture of Shawn from the soap opera episode (Chad) in the laundry place and treat it like you have to know what the pic is from to understand the humor. GReat Writers!|`|h0oHTKThaa	I want to like it. But it annoys me|`|78c33d47fef626fed067b2b7d6002a9eaa	One of my favorites on tv! The whole family can watch it, and those obscure 80s references are always hilarious. Shawn and Gus just make you smile :)|`|RrmzWSEHaa	i love this show. its just so different from what you usually see on TV. its amazingly funny!!!|`|p6viL2Bmaa	Yes it is. I discovered it over the weekend when I was at my friends house.  I'm now hooked.  Shawn reminds me of Ace Ventura at times.  Its funny.  Does anyone agree?|`|x5CBdBdJaa	I just started getting into it (the one about the murdered seal) and I think it is absoultely hilarious.  I love the witticisms and how its serious but not really, everything ends with a joke and meaning.|`|AA10629272	I really like the show. I started watching it after Monk, my favorite show. I love the way they make corny 80's references to almost everything. Both the guys are funny in their own way and the rest of the cast is awesome.

That gives them plenty of time to dub the episodes . So I would say mid April-late April they will start showing English Dubbed episodes of Naruto Shippuden.|`|NNyLiObLaa	Naruto Shippuden will arrive in the USA dubbed when Naruto finishes, there are still 11 episodes left. If you saw the January traler thing it was an advertisement saying that it was going to be dubbed, the january part of it was for the subbed viewers informing them that from the 15th they could watch subbs online on the website. They up to the part about the ninja dropouts, btw, just to let you and everyone else know.

If her first dance is the one where she is wearing the black thing and white boots and uses the chair the song is "Cold" by Annie Lennox.

If so, there is a technique called chart rectification, but it is easier to do if you are at least 28 to 30 years old plus... but even so, a really good rectifier could probably work with an approximate date... but if you don't even know the year, well... that's nearly impossible to deal with...|`|xj5KnGwEaa	There are a number of ways that doctors and physicians can estimate your age, but I do not believe there are any methods accurate enough to estimate the month.

ZyGyDLsDaa	People are forgetting the most important part of this, not just Nell sharing "twinspeak" with her sister. Nell's mother suffered a stroke, which affected her speech. Nell imitated how her mother spoke, which meant she slurred and distorted words, saying them the only way her mother was able to say them.     So, it's not just the isolation and communicating with her twin sister till her death. The "stroke speech" is what formed Nell's manner of speaking, that and the strong accent people speak with in that region.|`|cfdcea076742739e75b363443aad92a9aa	She was isolated from society.  For in depth info, visit link.|`|hVjxNhJWaa	She was left out there by herself for years|`|oKU7tFWyaa	Nell is a girl who's been brought up in an isolated world. The only person she knew was her mother and twin sister. They lived together in a cottage in the forest. Nobody has ever met Nell. After her mother's death, she's discovered by the local doctor Jerome. He's fascinated by her, since she speaks a mangled language, developed by her sister and herself growing up; "twin speak" if you will. But Paula, a psychology student, wants her observed in a laboratory. The judge decides they get three months to observe her in the forest, after which he'll decide about Nell's future.|`|efwvtzitaa	slight retardation/autistic
bd023cea955952a6366f0a9965ea13caaa	1. I think they are doing the best that they can do with eight kids. They are doing a great job!    2. I like them both. A lot of people don't like Mady, but I think that part of her personality is having a lot of attention, which she wants more than anything! Cara is just so laid-back and not so much in the center of attention like Mady(or like Mady wishes she could be).    3. I think they both are wonderful. They have their children's best interest at heart and you can tell they do the best they can to raise their kids. There is no doubt they love those kids! I do worry about what television will do to these children, but I cannot honestly tell you that I wouldn't have done the same thing if given the opportunity.    4. I love them all, really, but Aaden and Leah are probably my favorites!|`|7692f36a083ecf97b6999804a2093f71aa	Oops, I just asked a similar question about the show myself!  Anyway, I think for having 8 kids, they are doing a great job!  Yeah, Kate can be kind of uptight, but heck I would be too, seriously I would be going crazy!!  I just have 2 kids and sometimes find myself pretty stressed out.  I think Cara is an 'easier' twin, while Mady reminds me of MY daughter, very dramatic.  They are both good parents, I do admit, Kate yells at Jon a lot, but I have to yell at my husband too or he will just do his own thing and won't help out with our kids...as far as the 6 little ones, they are all absolutely adorable...I really like Alexis though, she is just a cutie!|`|MwOMTHkKaa	I think their parenting methods are good.  I like Cara more.  Kate is the better parent.  My favorite sextuplet is Aaden, he is so sweet.|`|g14bm4dJaa	1) I think they are pretty good parents, because the kids are generally well-behaved most of the time (no kids are ever ALWAYS well-behaved)    2) I like Cara because she is so sweeet and kind to the younger kids, but Mady cracks me up :]    3) I don't know about the "better parent" thing. They both seem like good parents to me, but Jon says kate is too strict and Kate says Jon is too loose, so idk    4) Alexis! She's so adorable and i love all of her little sayings. "I don't know why her did that?!"|`|RgOubjahaa	ithink they are really qood parents considerinq the fact that they have 8 kids all under the aqe of 10 .     ilike both the twins .    ithink they both are qood parents becus they do it toqether .    my favorite favorite sextuplet is alexis ithink she is soo cute . and so is collin !|`|b47fe4a0b1c7337ece7bbbffa4c65d6baa	I have always loved this show!!!1  My favorite twin is acra. AMddy is a little high strung for me  My favorite sextuplet boy is Aiden and girl is Alexis.  I think Kate can be a bit mean. She treats John like onw of the kids but she spends so much time around kids that she doesn't even realize it.|`|EY7xhPJnaa	I think they are ok parents... You have to run a tight **** with tthat many kids...but kate cane be rather abrasive...    cara by far... she is so laid back and good with the kids!    jon--he disciplines but still lets the kids have fun!    i think hannah  is my favorite... she is sooo cute!!|`|O36qjj7Oaa	I love the show and watch it all the time even reruns and the sextuplets are so cute.    1..They are great parents considering that they have 8 kids to take care of and im sure its very stressful at times.    2...Cara....Maddie is a brat.    3...They are both good parents with different ideas on parenting.    4..Aaden because he is very adorable with his little glasses.|`|m25lpepOaa	My favorite sextuplets are Aaden and Alexis, i think they keep the show moving with their quirkiness.     I think their parenting is very well organized.  I watch the show with my mother (who only has two children) and at the end of every single episode we watch she states "God bless them for doing that everyday".  The definitely have a system down and they are doing a very good job at taking care of the eight kids they have. You see all of these "Nanny" reality shows with parents who only have three or four kids and they are out of control. Jon and Kate have eight children, all around the same young age, and i think they hold down their fort better than most of the smaller families that have reality shows. I can't really judge which parent is "better" because they definitely do balance each other out. I think if Jon were to be in charge of them, the kids would be running wild and if Kate were in charge alone, she would either be too busy cleaning and being 'tyrant'-like (lol, that's not a bash, just a very convenient description) to let the children have any fun and they would go crazy.|`|O6k9CJypaa	i like that show !  but um how long will it last bacause they will eventually grow up ??  i like cara and maddy ! :)|`|RrmzWSEHaa	I think that their parenting is very amazing. they have been able to go out of the way to raise them in an organic environment which is a challenge.    i like both of the twins they are very interesting and unique in their own ways.    they are both amazing. John is the nice straight forward dad, and kate is more like working creatively around the rules.    i love joel and leah !!!|`|AOBEkqzXaa	I think their parenting skills are just fine...you try raising 8 kids at one time and see how that works out...haha...I personally know I would go BONKERS!!    The girls are my favorite. I think Alexis is adorable but all the girls are beautiful each in their own way.     I think John is very laid back and is used to Kate telling him what to do, when to do it, and how to do it correctly...haha|`|ppE0GtkIaa	none :o(|`|MzgecQSLaa	I LOVE THIS SHOW!!    My favorite twin is Cara because Maddy's kind of a brat. I think Jon is the better parent because he's more laid back than Kate. Kate's kind of uptight.|`|24YUFk0oaa	there parenting i love it. There not harsh but there not push over's. I mean it must be crazy with 8 kids. I love kara because she reminds me of myself when i  was little. I love jon because he is so funny , he always make's a situation funny. and my fav sextuplet is ADAIN :)(L) he's so adorable. but i like alexis too.|`|XnTdmC5Naa	1. I cannot comment on their parenting because they have to take care of 8 freakin kids. I don't have a single kid yet they have 8.    2. Cara. Maddie is way too much of a drama queen for her age    3. Jon, he seems calmer    4. No favorite, but I will say the 3 boys are more interesting than the girls. If I had to choose Aaden or Colin.|`|6YYJHdQ2aa	I love the show but I think Kate can be a little mean to John but i guess with 8 kids i would be too!

Good luck.|`|wU0c3i7baa	If it was any other celeb, I'd say no, but you have a shot with Robert. He could at least ask his agency to send it.

Also, the guy can't even figure out how to pay a parking ticket, so the whole going to the post office thing could be stretch too ;)    Good luck.

First of all this movie will get a lot of those people who will whine about everything that is not realistic really (If you are one of those, you'll have a lot to whine about). But if you can just enjoy a movie as its intended to be and you appreciate some action this movie is near perfect. The main character is so pure and non complex. Finally an action movie that doesn't try to give some oddities to the characters to make them more interesting but just straightforward high speed action .    Watching this movie was a great experience and I was surprised that I could enjoy an action movie this much. My tip: sit down, enjoy the ride and don't moan about imperfections.|`|wI5SU7ykaa	Taken - my sister saw the movie and was stunned- everyone in the movie theaters were going crazy its a good movie.

78d567ba4ef552df04b4e4bac0f97f4daa	I heard It was Just about Done I Would Look For It To Come out Sometime later In The year.I Know Omar Has An Album Comming out Very Soon.        Mars Volta guitar player and musical mastermind Omar Rodriguez-Lopez's says that the next two Mars Volta records are already recorded and waiting for a release date -- this on the heels of a Grammy nomination for 'Wax Simulcra,' off last year's 'The Bedlam in Goliath.' Of course, the first of these won't see the light of day until at least this spring, as vocals need to be recorded and additional tweaking may be necessary. And Rodriguez-Lopez isn't giving any possible titles away. "I gave the band a six-month break," he says. "I'm not trying to force my pace. I'll just be here doing what I'm doing, recording more albums. When the time comes, the time comes."    Right now, the time is ripe for collaboration with L.A. underground hip-hop label Stones Throw in the form of a solo album, titled 'Old Money.' Rodriguez-Lopez and label head Peanut Butter Wolf have been friends for some time, and releasing a wildly progressive rock album didn't seem like such a crazy idea, considering Stones Throw's eclectic roster. 'Old Money' deals with the entrenched political power structure of the United States, although Rodriguez-Lopez views the Obama administration as a breath of fresh air. "All [Mars Volta's] political views have always been shrouded in metaphor and veiled on our other records," he explains. "For some reason, I had the urge to do something a little more obvious."   As for that Grammy nod, Rodriguez-Lopez isn't playing it entirely cool. "I'm not gonna pretend like, 'Yeah, man, that doesn't mean s---,'" he says. "It's not validating me or putting me down. It's like if someone invites you over to their house for dinner. It's nice of them if they invite you into their home, so you accept it and go over and see whether it's awkward or not." Our advice? Bring a nice bottle of wine.

As though I was going through puberty again. However, I KNOW it's not because of that. Is it winter where you are? It might be because you're singing straight from the cold, and your voice is not warmed up. Even if it isn't winter or cold and you are not warmed up, you could "crack". It is a possibility and a solution to your question. So try warm-ups. Also, don't try to sing if you're sick. I'm not sure if this could be a possibility; but could it be lack of breath support and singing from the throat?    - 16 too, male.

0l88fiUTaa	I pay a lot of attention to people, their  expressions and little quirks, and body language and emotions, also the vibes that I get from them.......so later on in my head I can't always picture their face very clearly but I remember and picture them by their personalities or mannerisms.     moon: virgo|`|cVVvHNXSaa	Yes, absolutely.. the little details contributes mostly to the finished result.     Thanks to my Virgo moon.|`|uel6NBOVaa	Nope, I'm a big picture person. Detail work is not my thing.     Cancer Moon, Libra Mercury|`|cpOMMZffaa	yes  idk  that's nice  cool.|`|2IddNqy9aa	i'm a pisces. i just go with the flow, the whole picture is more important to me than details. my moons in saggitarius and my rising sign is in scorpio.     Details are overrated|`|3q3bXWMFaa	yes  what's a moon sign?|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	I don't. People who pay attention to every little detail irritate me. I think of the broad picture.     Leo.|`|2DAfAjv2aa	Yeah, it bothers me when something's out of place or isn't right.    Sagittarius moon.|`|HWkXDSqkaa	Usually I do yes but then I forget about it in the future.  Im a Leo|`|72532a1cf9806107fc39d44e8390d61aaa	Sometimes I pay attention to detail. It depends on what I'm doing or how important it is. But, for the most part I try to make myself pay attention to detail the older I get because I have learned over the years that no doing so can be a big problem sometimes.    My sun is Sagittarius  Moon is Taurus  Rising is Capricorn|`|edJtHlDiaa	No i'm the total opposite to that i could give a crap less about every little detail that passes me even though sometimes i will if it's something real important "to me" but in general i don't do that.|`|3f0f30290df1d9b27952ae1e68559da5aa	Yes, very much so.  Libra moon.
Rvkpe9uaaa	i used to cry every night thinking about dying and i still get upset when i think of me or a family member dying because like you said i dont know what will happen to me and im afraid i will never get to live another life and for people who "welcome death" i hope you are happy when you get run over by a car and you are in pain about to die then i want you to rethink Dying|`|c302cbf4b446e1a459fa99e0177f27c7aa	I'm afraid of dying before I get all I can out of life, yes, not really afraid about what happens after death or afterlife.|`|mLdlFhyqaa	I have no fear whatsoever of actual death.  Must be all the Bible reading.    However, I am very concerned about the manner in which I die.  I want it to just be like, I fall asleep comfortably one night, perfectly alright, but then I die, then I wake up in front of Saint Peter's podium.|`|8pe9ZDMxaa	No.|`|cf4edaf15617b46e94d234ea845ecdebaa	Being a Christian has taken the fear away..  I don't want to rush dying but I am ready to meet my maker when the time comes|`|k0Ewe7mCaa	I'm not afraid of dying, I'm afraid on what I'm going to miss out on.|`|G1fDp1PEaa	NO, I welcome it.    End of misery and a sad existence.|`|srHRbU7yaa	no i'm not because i have no idea whats on the other side and i have no idea what i will be missing if i dont die so it dosent matter.|`|Um7mYM71aa	When I was a teenager|`|9wSjCIsTaa	not me but the ones i love...|`|a8878aa5ea57903ab8121a0f2f95b0ceaa	No|`|49178f1466ec5d626a8fc1819b87282eaa	i'm afraid of dying before i accomplish anything meaningful in my life.    but afraid of death?  not really...|`|AA12383908	Believe in God get saved and you will go straight to Heaven.|`|AA11518036	NO l'm not.|`|UlME0etLaa	Sort of it depends what kind of death. Natural causes? sure why the hell not.  Cancer- my greatest fear.|`|cdpy5iv5aa	No|`|2624d3bf8e4e63e26e8d8d37caca1505aa	No but I don't sit around dwelling on it.|`|UwFb8cleaa	not dieing but going to hell. or living another life... i think after this one ill be done|`|OwdoUJuRaa	yes.|`|b1ri9E45aa	Yea!  I don't want to die alone!

And why do all these girls go on his show? Because he is famous and they want to get on T.V.|`|RgOubjahaa	he probably does have a small penis and the qirls dont care becus he has money they qet to qo out for free and they qo on tv !|`|kzlKyivPaa	Like seriously, how would we know this answer?  Watch his videos, that will show you|`|njbmqjCTaa	I guess I personally wouldn't know. Lol. Way too much respect for myself than that!|`|WyxxDgSeaa	I wouldn't know or want to know. But who's lower, Michaels or the women that go on his show?|`|m25lpepOaa	This is probably a huge stereotype, but most of the girls that go on that show (just like many of the other men/women on other shows, like True Chance of Love, I Love New York, A Shot at Love) either go on it for fun or for fame, and end up "falling in love" by coincidence.

But my all time favorite song of theirs is "If I was your Mother" from the album Keep the Faith.  It's so much heavier than their other songs - it's always stood out for me.  I've always wondered why more people didn't like it - usually when I mention it, no one seems to even know it.|`|6of3tqHhaa	Well I dont have a favorite, they're all my favorites!|`|wOc4Dqllaa	THANK GOD, ANOTHER FAN!

cfdcea076742739e75b363443aad92a9aa	It depends on what your trying to watch.      Computer technology improves faster then most people can keep up with.      First thing you need to make sure is, if your computer specs can play the movie format you are trying to watch, such as mpeg, HD, Blue ray etc....  In most cases, computer users do not have the power to play newer technology movies.      Make sure you have the latest video card, drivers, etc.....    Make sure you have a compatible player for the movie you are trying to watch.     Make sure you internet connection is appropriate speed.        That should cover it.|`|cILeS32iaa	You might try different player like VLC which is free.    What sort of movie file are you playing anyway?    Sometimes too much background program is running can effect the overall performance of your computer.    See whether Virus Scanning is running on the background.      http://what-you-should-do.blogspot.com/|`|abkPVogJaa	Do you mean DVDs that you put in your computer or from movies that you downloaded from the net. A lot of the times it can be the movie player that your using.|`|dixO8N8kaa	get faster service. make sure nothing else is running. make sure there is no virus or spyware.    mostly get faster service.|`|SFZq3ullaa	yeah try downloading VLC  or SUPER!!  super will play any form of media  even ones that VLC and Media player had trouble playing...  i also recommend running a disk cleanup and defragging your computer and scanning for any viruses...      disk clean and defrag can be found in your start up menu under programs/accessories/system tools    run disk clean up then defrag  (it may take awhile so i recommend doing this before you go to bed)    then restart your computer  then download spybot search and destroy to check for virus and such...(its free)    if all this check out and you still have problems then yeah try VLC or SUPER   or try them first ... lol  :)

I think Angelina is absolutely STUNNING and she's a natural beauty - her facial features are just perfect!! I DO think that her body is looking rather sad though. She has to put on weight and build some muscle and tone her body because her body is extremely unattractive at the moment :(    If I were a guy, I would go for Angelina (but when her body was more buff and toned, ie The second Tomb Raider!|`|AA10368887	I'd rather bang some sense and/or morality into your head.

tZUSVuUvaa	Yes, I understand completely. I can't stand most of the sappy "chick flicks" that a lot of my friends like because they aren't realistic at all. I think part of the reason we are so unhappy is because we've been given false hopes by all of the Disney movies we were spoonfed as children. You grow up and realize that you really aren't a princess, there is no Prince Charming, and elves and woodland creatures aren't going to magically appear and make everything all right.       Heh..I had a bad week too.    The first answerer makes a good point. There are a lot of movies out there where things end badly but more honestly. Requiem for a Dream was really good and it didn't sugarcoat things.|`|PpuOab4Gaa	Not all of them have happy endings, especially with true stories.|`|ZyGyDLsDaa	There are thousands of films with unhappy endings! Here are some of them:  Butch Cassidy & the Sundance Kid~They tried to give it a light touch, but it still comes down to them being shot down in a barrage of bullets.  The Postman Always Rings Twice~both versions  I'll Always Know What You Did Last Summer  Madame Bovary~various versions  I Love You, I Love You Not (1996)  Wuthering Heights~both versions  Romeo & Juliet~various versions  Anna Karenina~various versions  Anne of the Thousands Days  A Star Is Born~all versions  The Last Time I Saw Paris  Gone With the Wind  The Sterile Cuckoo  The Way We Were  A Place in the Sun  Double Indemnity  Cool Hand Luke  Bonnie & Clyde  Forever Amber  Brian's Song  The Descent  Bug (2006)  Chinatown  Lady Jane  Gallipoli  Camille    Actually, many horror movies do not have upbeat endings. Someone might survive, but s/he has lost all of his/her friends. Hollywood and other filmmakers have been filming such stories since the Silents. Actually, I hear a lot of people complain about the lack of happy endings outside of "chick flicks".

iYoCZVpmaa	isn't it called Eternal Sunshine ?
1PdUecpYaa	i'm a pisces with gemini moon too. my rising is scorpio though  your sun sign makes you kind of sensitive, intuitive and imaginative. your moon sign balances that out, because gemini is an intellectual sign. when you're feeling emotional, you tend to think about it rationally and you might have a habit of talking about your issues with everyone you know. you're very intellectual, creative and you have a curious mind.   your rising sign is sagittarius. to others, you might appear more outgoing than most pisces. pisces are usually quiet and reserved. you might be just the opposite of that. you like to go on a wild adventure and seek new things. you're very friendly and have lots of friends and acquaintances.    edit: just wondering.. when's your birthday? sounds like it might be pretty close to mine...|`|jAkTbmswaa	Sun Sign-    Pisces  February 19 - March 20  Pisces is the twelfth Sign of the Zodiac, and it is also the final Sign in the Zodiacal cycle. Hence, this Sign brings together many of the characteristics of the eleven Signs that have come before it. Pisceans, however, are happiest keeping many of these qualities under wraps. These folks are selfless, spiritual and very focused on their inner journey. They also place great weight on what they are feeling. Yes, feelings define Pisceans, and it's not uncommon for them to feel their own burdens (and joys) as well as those of others. The intuition of the Pisces-born is highly-evolved. Many people associate Pisceans with dreams and secrets, and it's a fair association, since those born under this Sign feel comfortable in an illusory world.    It's a pair of Fish that represents Pisceans, a symbol which prompts others to suggest that these people 'go with the flow' and 'don't make waves.' Both of these labels are true, since Pisceans are fluid and easy-going, in keeping with the Mutable Quality assigned to this Sign. The fact that two fish (as opposed to one) represent the members of this Sign also speaks to the duality of Pisceans, their yin and yang sensibility. Pisceans alternate between reality and non-reality in keeping with their introspective natures; their voyage between consciousness and an unconscious dream state says much about their intuitive, almost psychic natures. For this reason, Pisceans can be hard to pin down, prompting some to call them the chameleons of the Zodiac. The Fish are happy to be considered hazy, since there's a certain sense of safety in that self-proclaimed netherworld. That said, they won't stay away for long, since one of their primary goals is to help others. Pisceans are compassionate, charitable and will quickly put the needs of others ahead of their own. It's this kind of self-sacrifice which keeps these folks going. The flip side to their giving natures is that oft-timid Fish are likely to be taken advantage of by less well-meaning souls.     Moon Sign-    Lunar Geminis are usually pleasant, witty, and charming people. At home and with family, however, they can be moody and irritable at times. People with Moon in Gemini are always interesting people--they have a finger in every pie, are curious to a fault, and are generally well-informed.      Nervousness and worry are common traits with this lunar position. An underlying restlessness is common, and many Lunar Geminis need more stimulation than others. They usually read a lot, talk a lot, and think a lot with this airy, mutable position of the Moon.     Their homes are often a perpetual work-in-progress. They generally dislike housework, but are big on home improvement. Re-organizing their homes in little--and sometimes big--ways seems to keep them happy, as Lunar Geminis are easily bored by both routine and constancy. Often, this is a reflection of their inner world--"the grass is always greener..." applies here. Inwardly, Lunar Geminis are often unsettled. Moon in Gemini parents are generally more adept at handling the intellectual needs of their children than emotional ones. Others' complicated emotions, in general, can be difficult for Lunar Geminis to handle.     In their families, Lunar Geminis often take on the role of organizing get-togethers. They are at their best when they have plenty of things to do beyond routine.     Ascendant Sign-    Jupiter (the 'Great Benefic') rules Sagittarius. Sagittarius rules the thighs and hips, which are the prime movers in enabling man to travel afar, to stand, to sit, and to enjoy a full measure of life. This ascendant causes the native to be jovial and hearty, a witty and adept conversationalist -- capable of telling a 'tall' story now and then. These people have a somewhat uncanny ability to meet and become 'old friends' with total strangers quickly, mainly because of their ability to make others feel important. This ascendant likes to travel and likes the great out-of-doors in both a physical and mental sense. There is a strong desire both for freedom of thought and action. They tend to be frank and honest to the letter. They may be inclined to be somewhat impatient and impulsive, which may cause frequent changes of interests. They generally like things done on a grand scale.    Appearance: 'Distinguished looking' is a term which will describe many with Sagittarius ascending. The native may be rather tall and large but not overweight until well past middle age. The face, like Jupiter, tends to be roundish and jovial, somewhat elongated. The teeth may be large and can protrude. The hair is dark in youth but impressively white in later years. There often is a tendency to stamp or scrape the feet|`|2IddNqy9aa	I'm a Pisces too!!! My moon is Saggitarius, and my ascendant sign is Scorpio. I'm so awesome.     Your stuff confuses me, just google search it.
94zi1LFFaa	yes its very possible the online compatibility chart is wrong... its just a computer composite of your charts... take what you need & leave the rest behind... the other side of it is that all relationships have their trials... that's what makes them great because you learn from each other... if you both love each other then ~go with that~...     when you have cash, the best way to know is to find yourself an accredited astrologer that you click really well with & one who has a sensitive emotion... best way to find an astrologer in your area is talk to a local homeopath (ask your local health food store where to find one). sometimes there are local astrologers advertising in local news papers too... only follow through with one if they ~feel~ right to you. if you feel at all strange about that person then find someone else...    ~peace|`|631c8fd5c39d806e031079d8fccb75f9aa	Simply from an astrological standpoint, aspects like squares and oppositions (the negative ones) are not an indication that things won't work out.  It simply means there may be quite a few challenges and rough spots in a relationship.  It doesn't mean that there isn't love, or a good, working relationship.  Since you didn't give any astrological info, I couldn't possibly go in depth...but basically:  A rule of thumb here:  Use astrology for insight; don't allow it to make decisions for you or run your life.    Aside from that, your feelings about a person and the way you're ACTUALLY getting along are a much better indication of whether or not things will actually work out than astrology.  People's charts do not indicate who they ARE, simply what they have to work with, and the energies at play in their personality.  Two people with similar charts could act wildly different from each other based on their level of maturity.  Love and the ability to yield in compromise is also a very powerful force, and can overcome many potential problems in a compatibility chart.    If you want a semi-detailed, free report, head over to astro.com, get an account, put in both yours and his birth info, and look at some of the free reports they have.  I find it to be a fairly reliable site.
lpyWVR2oaa	He is a Sun sign Libra with a Sagittarius Moon.    Edit: If you have a Fire or Air Moon, this match will work better. Compatibility takes in all the different planetary alignments in the birth chart. Ascendant is not a major consideration though. The Sun and Moon are more important in this case.

32P3hG0Laa	You don't have to work alone, but you do need to be in a charged, exciting work environment. Do not become an accountant|`|lpyWVR2oaa	With this aspect, not only are you attracted to the unusual, innovative and highly unusually creative or just plain weird when it comes to your career decisions, there is also a tendency not to stick to one job for very long, esp. after boredom sets in.     Uranus' role is to shock people by focusing on unconventionality and sometimes radicalism when it comes to social norms, rules and regulations. Hence, you could also put this to good use by focusing on far-out and generally socially unacceptable methods to advance your career goals.|`|LrKCLZF7aa	Uranus is the planet of Change and therefore has dominion over change and the study of change such as astrology and the I Ching. It rules flight because it was discovered around the first flight done with hot air balloons. It also rules things that are new and the news. The internet and inventions. I don't think it means that you must work alone having a conjunction to the Midheaven. What it does to though is it makes you inclined to love change in your work and in your life. For example you won't like the same meal twice a day. You wouldn't want a job that is the same thing every day. All of the things that I mentioned are all field that you will be attracted to and most of them do require that you work alone. Uranus also rules the world, the public, media, fame, and the famous.    I'm curious. What is your work?|`|EuwjIJ3Zaa	Uranus conjunct Midheaven will drive you to be in an unsual field.  You might be attracted to science, or some other field that lets you explore, and question.     It also could also have a different effect depending on it's other aspects. You might be really unstable in your career; instead of looking for a career that gives you freedom, you might simply value freedom so much, it interferes with you having a steady job.    You probably had a very unstable home environment growing up, and either your mother or your father, more than likely your mother, played a role in giving you unique ideas, and pushed you to be yourself. This either happened directly, by their insistence, or indirectly by their lack of insistence.    MUST work alone is not correct.  It's more that you MUST have the freedom to express yourself.  MUST not be tied down, would be more accurate.    Depending on the degrees, it may also be making aspects to your ascendant.  This only amplifies it's effects.

tZUSVuUvaa	I don't know. I think they go after the sites and providers mainly because it would be much more time consuming and difficult to go after each individual watcher.

I really hope they don't do that because I have to download a lot of files for work (I work from home) and I think it would be an invasion of privacy to have my ISP scanning everything that I've downloaded each month.|`|AA11008280	I really dont know..

g4AhD4c5aa	OMG hopefully nott!!! =(  But it was a really cute episode though..I LOVE BROOKE AND JULIAN... But noo it's not the last episode.. Sometimes there are not enought episodes in the season, than the CW actually predicted, so in order for the show to finish on the scheduled month, the CW will prolong it, and they will have a new episode then have a re-run, then the next week will be a new one. So dont worry, it will prob be a repeat next week, because im sure they wouldn't just end the show like that..
