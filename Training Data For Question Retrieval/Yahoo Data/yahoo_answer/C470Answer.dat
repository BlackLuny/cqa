b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	Is it an old heater?  Might be worth it to just get a new one.  They'll last around 15 yrs depending on your water quality.  Look at the serial   on the front label.  The first two numbers are the year it was made.(04=2004)  The next two are the week of the year.(13=the 13th week)  So  041365748374 would mean it was built in the 13th week of 2004.    If it's fairly new, then yes I would replace the pressure relief valve.  Or TPI valve.  You can buy them at any hardware store.  Make sure you get the same size/style.  Shut the water off, turn off the power, and you might want to drain the water down past the level of the pressure valve, otherwise more water will spill out. But not that much.  You don't have to drain the whole thing.  Do this by attaching a hose to the drain valve and removing one of the flex hoses at the top of the heater.  Remove the old pressure valve.  Install the new one with teflon tape.  Reconnect the flex, remove the hose, turn on the water with the hot side open on a faucet to let the air out.  Once the water starts running freely, shut it off and check for leaks.  No leaks?  Then turn on the breaker and you're good to go.  But if its old,you really don't want to put your money into something that may or may not last much longer.  The reason the line goes down to the floor is that,  if the valve ever opened due to overheating,  it won't shoot scalding water in your face.|`|cu8jrdCmaa	Replace the valve- they fail when they're old.|`|NTwak9Njaa	put a pot under it and call a plumber.  That is a pressure release valve.  It prevents it from exploding.|`|fyWGMB9caa	the valve is the for a safety . it will "leak " water for two reasons .  too high a temperature of water  or too much pressure in the tank /system  . if it is extremely old it maybe be just old and faulty|`|BbK0fA4Laa	The valve/ faucet is for connecting a hose up to for draining the tank. If you turn the water off to fix or you drain the tank its self make sure you turn off the electrical first. I    if the line where the water is leaking is hot then this is from the tank its self and the tank will need to be turned off and drained before replacing or repairing that leaky pipe. If the pipe is cold then its the supply into the tank. In that case you can just turn off the water at the main shutoff of the water meter. I always suggest doing both to be on the safe side.    You can use Quest compression fittings, they have them at lowes, on most any kind of pipe. You will need to measure the size of the pipe where the connection is going so you get the right size. If the leak is at the end yopu can most likely just slip on a new connector. if the leak is in the middle somewhere you will have to cut the leak off. Cut on either side of the leak with a hacksaw or sawzall.    Caution: Never re-establish electrical power to the tank if its not filled and full. You can try rocking it slighty back and forth to see if its full. It will not be moveable if it is full.

6SwaWSoyaa	My suggestion is that you go to a local hardware store such as Home Depot, Lowes, etc. and ask them about doors and tell them that you have thinner walls. You don't necessarily have to have a certain thickness to a wall for a door, but you will have to know the thickness for a specific door and even at that they can order on specially made for you.|`|UQWusO1waa	I doesn't matter how thick your wall is. interior doors 1 1/2 inches thick no no matter how thick the wall is. What you need to know is how wide the opening is and how tall it is. they are usually standard sizes. 99% of the time. ;like 30, 32, 34, 36 inches wide and 70, 72, 76, 80 inches tall,  An interior door from home depot cost ( with out a frame) because yours is already there, costs about $30. they already have the hole for the door knob cut out. So you buy a door knob $10 and door hinges $6 . if you google "www.lowe`s.com" you can see them. they have them at home depot too .and they also come in white already painted  ..then google" how to install an interior door" to see how. an interior door is not hard to install.     http://www.lowes.com/lowes/lkn?action=pr...  if you have any questions feel free to e mail me. I think you should have a door too.   Or if you just a cheap privacy door like thing one of these  http://www.lowes.com/lowes/lkn?action=pr...  total cost $25 and comes with the tract and all you need .that you just screw to the top of your door opening. no hinges  or anything. you put this up your self.|`|874EAxkfaa	measure the size of door opening,tell dad to buy a pre-hung door.|`|ygDZpQHEaa	I will suggest you to ask any professional.

3ZWBRRfsaa	Fabric softener works good.  You can even dilute some with water and put it in a spray bottle for touch ups throughout the day.   Hairspray also works.  Yes,  hairspray.  Just a light little spray can really make a difference.  Just be sure that it isn't silk or some other delicate fabric.  Maybe you are just an electrifying person.  LOL!  Good luck.|`|aa2131f0b0d93de418b8d02cace49bafaa	Make sure you use fabric softener in the washer or dryer. If your still getting shocks you can get a can of Static Guard.   This is happening because the air is dry. You can leave a pot of water simmering on the stove or buy a humidifier to add moisture to the air.|`|TJpQZju2aa	fabric softener sheets work well for me, and leave your clothes just slightly damp|`|CfUVG6IYaa	Static Guard is great - make sure to follow the instructions on the can though. Certain fabrics just make more static than others - like acrylic or polyester are really bad, so try wearing more cotton. Also, try using a humidifier or vaporizer in your house. Increasing the moisture in the air will help.
tI7QP3dkaa	You can buy the dry cleaning spirits it do it yourself.      the best way to freshen up those "dry clean only" garments is to put them in the dryer on a low to medium heat setting with either a dryer sheet or a sachet and a damp (not wet) towel. The heat will make the damp towel "steam" your clothes and the dryer sheet will freshen the scent and eliminate that static. It's a wonderful way to make your dry cleaning only an occasional occurrence.    Handwash some items like Wool, cashmere etc in luke warm water no detergent.|`|Xw7vmK3laa	Kai, I use Drycleaner's Secret for clothing that is not knit.  Put garments in the dryer with the sheet, and follow directions.  Knits will stretch out using this method.  So, I put sweaters and other knits in the bag with the sheet from Dryel.  Dryel also has a good spot remover.  I still send silk blouses to cleaners.  Hand washing and pressing looks bad.  Hope these two products help.  Always press those old rayons with low heat on the wrong side.|`|sAuB8vLCaa	In the super markets they have what is called  dryel or dryall, that u use in the dryer, I've heard good things about it, give it a go.

5BOZ2ryLaa	You can call the utility company and give them the house address.  They should be able to give you the dollar amount of the highest and the lowest bill in the last year.  That would give you a good idea of how much to budget for your electricity and water.  I'm in Washington State,  too,  and have a big house.  My biggest elec bill was $240, but that was during a heat wave when we ran the A/C a lot.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	it depends on what state you live in, the kilowatts are expensive in California and cheaper in NY|`|flkVehA9aa	I would budget about $400 a month for Utility bills until you get a better feel for it.|`|PP0hNckuaa	depends...im not really sure coz we live in two different countries    yours truly  tobolita  http://doubleu3x.blogspot.com/|`|7o27vGPvaa	Well it would really help to know the square footage and other details of the house.

If you have electric heating, then more.|`|osHRtmwNaa	400 for bills/utilities should be more than enough. If you can save 1500 monthly, you will be fine. That should include transportation and food as well if you can budget very well. Its only the two of you and as long as you dont eat lobster and steak daily and are "green" when it comes to using water and electric you should be fine.
HnEcgVGiaa	Try to keep the furniture contemporary. If you go to IKEA, you should be able to find great furniture that has both bright colors and the ability to customize how your room looks like. Instead of the traditional wood patterned desks and drawers, try seeking those with bold and bright colors. A desk with glass desktop would be pretty neat too.    As for your walls, you can go to Home Depot or Lowe's and the store associates can help you find some cool design patterns. You can put posters of your favorite bands and singers.    Lighting is very important. Even if you have great furniture with awesome colors, you need great ambient lighting to bring them out. Some cheap light bulbs produce a yellowish hue. Look for one that puts out a pure white or slightly blue/aqua hue.    Make sure you take into consideration of the carpet type/color, as well as your curtains too.    Top it all off with Glade plug-ins or other air fresheners with scents that you love.|`|NpJk2Heraa	oK SO....u should do something personal...hmm..oh i got it!! Ok take a ride to wal-mart or walgreens or some stores that have a photo shop. Then u can give them ur fave band and take a poster with u just in case. Then make sure they take a good pic of u. Then ask them to tint that poster into different colors and make a pic of u out of that. I dont know if anyone does that but it seems like a good idea. Also I have this in my room and im sure people do that in photo shops. It cost me 25 dollars and they put my pic on the cover of VOGUE magazine (not real) and they made it bigger and a framed it on my wall. It looks so kewl! Another idea would be get musical note templates and do them on ur wall in ur fave colors!And u can also teke cd's and turn them around get like 8 each and glue them with a string connecting and put it on ur walls. Its gonna look gorgeous!  Heres some more creative ideas, make lots of small pics of ur fave bands and singers and make a collage out of them. Mess them up, staple them and the frame them in like a black frame, decorate it. Cut out music notes out of hard paper, decorate and hang on wall.

Furniture ideas- spray paint some of your furniture and add special stickers.....cover your furniture in fabric  get a bean bag chair|`|6SwaWSoyaa	How many walls do you have?  Well I am going to assume you have four. Paint the opposite of each other in the same color in complimentary colors. I am going to say that you take a nice sky blue and paint the two walls opposite of each other. For the other two walls paint it a lighter brighter orange. Furniture wise I am going to say black because you want a neutral color that is nice and sharp. Do you have a certain comforter or anything, because I am going to suggest that you get a nice lighter green and then you can add themes of music to your walls.   Do you have any instruments, because instruments really do make nice decorations sometimes, for example I have my clarinet, flute and trombone out into a position where it looks nice, won't get harmed, and very accessible so I can play them still.  Frame cds that you don't listen to but you still like or frame your favorite artists, etc in black frames and hang them in an orderly fashion.  Also make collages of musical images, etc and frame them in a black photo frame.  You should only need one lamp, or if you have a ceiling fan the light on that will be ok. The paints that I've suggested should give you an equal balance of lighting.  I hope I have helped.|`|lJO1xbg6aa	Hmm..you should go with like a bright colorful retro look.

I reccomend lime green that has a hint of blue, with medium-light wood furniture and polka dots/stripes. Look through Potterybarn and Delias catalogs. Let's get started!     Paint a picture in your mind of what your desired outcome is, and make sure it will be a haven that you enjoy spending time in.    Now Clean it!!. It is very hard to remodel a room that you can't even walk in because of all the clutter on the floor.What do you no longer need in your room? Use plastic bags to sort out stuff that you are getting rid of. This would be a great time to have a yard sale.  You will also make a bit of money to use when buying new items for your room.. You can also change pictures in hanging picture frames to fit the theme of your room or paint the walls a different color.    Replace some of the old items that you have eliminated before with their new counterparts. Think back to the picture you painted in your mind earlier. Is this what you had planned? Is it better? Worse? In some cases you may feel you need to start over. However, don't do this if you aren't completely sure.

1nbYdXE0aa	A bow window is in the shape of a bow with a gentle curve on the outside. A Bay window has three different angles and got it's name from houses on the waterfront being built with projected windows with smaller windows on the side so they could look out up and down the bay. They are not the same.  Pella & Andersen, Marvin, Peachtree are all top of the line. Plan on $1800-$3,000 depending on the size.   Go to your local lumber center and get some references of contractors from the commercial sales dept. Talk to friends and neighbors who you see have had some remodeling done in the past.  Companies that specialize in just windows and doors will try to push THEIR brand of windows. If you contract through a contractor he/she will install any window brand you select.  Pella has their own "Pella window store" yellow pages. They will also come out and measure your window.  You want insulated glass - people still refer to this as "Thermopane which went out 15 years ago.  There are thousands of window companies, but only a handful that have been around over 30 years or more. Don't fooll yourself - there is a reason why some windows cost twice as much as others - they are built better and have a better company standing behind the warranty.  We have installed many bay and bow windows - so expect to pay a total cost installed of $3,500 - $5,000 depending on the window size and the ease of installation. Go with vinyl or aluminum clad wood window in the brands i suggested.  Good Luck|`|LP56IpSwaa	It is often called a 'bay' window and is best when pre-fabricated. Pre-fab construction materials are superior in durability as they are made to endure the transportation. Your biggest challenge lies in choosing the best installer.    I have recently replaced windows and was very satisfied with Champion windows manufactured in Denver, Colorado after much research and the advice of a local consumer advocate, Tom Martino.    The brand of window will be highly dependent on your geographical area, but these tips will help get you started. You will be equally satisfied with whichever brand gives you the style/color that you are looking for.    1) Anderson & Pella windows are the 'gold' standard  2) Double pane is ideal, Triple pane is a gimmick.  3) Fill the double pane with Argon gas, if they are made locally, otherwise it can be a gimmick.  4) Choose the UV coating on the window for significant home comfort and to protect curtains and furniture from sun damage.    Try three to five estimates on the labor selection and ask them to bring photos and references of previous similar installations. Fortunately you don't have to worry about price, but you will quickly discover which contractors are not timely and communicative.    Good luck on your project!

It is unlikely that you could make it grow and survive in your part of the world.    It can be used as a temporary filler around artificial plants, however, you will need to fumigate it first because redbugs and other unsociable critters live in it.

0AaiHizlaa	I prefer back curtains cause they make the room feel more homely and warm in the Winter.    I don't have dark curtains either,..they will make the room look allot smaller.    But i can understand why some might say they make a room look smaller.    Blinds are then a bit better in that since cause they don't hide corners in you're room and make it look bigger.    But i think blinds make are best for Kitchens,Bathrooms etc etc ,..not for Lounges,..they just don't look right.    But it depends what you're decor is like and what you like.

ophRjoBKaa	What part of the world are you in?  Where are you keeping your shimpaku juniper?  My suspicion is that you are keeping this tree indoors and the tree has died.    Junipers are outdoor plants and do not adapt well to an indoor environment. They thrive outdoors and will quickly decline and die indoors.    Junipers (and most conifers) can hold their green color for many weeks or even months after they have died. You may not even notice the decline, but it will surely die indoors.    Junipers do best will higher humidity than you can provide inside. They also do best in full sun, which is difficult to provide indoors. You would do best to find a spot outdoors for your juniper, or try your luck at something tropical such as a ficus.

Things like handwash wools can be washed on a seperate program, as can things like nylons and silk.<br>  <br>  Delicate things such as tights/stockings etc. are best washed in a washbag so as they don't get caught on the inside of the machine.<br>  <br>  I also wash all the whites together on a seperate wash so as colours don't run.<br>  <br>  Things like towells and cloths can be washed at a higher temperature if you wish.<br>  <br>  As for soap I use Persil capsules using 2 capsules for a normal wash and 1 for a small load.  I also add a cap of comfort consentrate to give a soft finish and to stop anything turning out static.<br>  <br>  I personally don't bother ironing, once they've been rinsed and spinned in the machine I just leave them by the radiator or in the wamth and within a day they are dry. <br>  <br>  I've found that even when I've ironed things like shirts and t-shirts, put them away in the wardrobe or chest of drawers, that when I come to wear them again they've become all creased up, even though I ironed them.<br>  <br>  If you do want to iron then anything of cotton is ok.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|FNFJCHEXaa	I use Purex (it's pretty cheap) and use COLD water for almost everything so that I don't shrink anything.

Keep the wall paper wet, you may have to remove it in layers.  After the paper is all off wet the wall one last time to remove any glue residue and wash with a moist sponge.<br>  <br>  The secret is to keep it wet and give the DIF time to work (5 to 10 minutes per layer).

I would water the plant really well before you leave (but don't leave it standing in water, that could kill it also).<br>  <br>  If you want to get tricky, you could use a shoelace. Wet the shoelace first, then push one end up through the drainage holes in the bottom of the pot with a pencil, deep into the soil.

They may have discovered that peanut butter is a bad thing. If you don't catch any more after you change the bait , you've probably caught them all.   Mice can get through a hole the size of a dime. So they could be getting in through holes where your pipes come in under the sinks. The cold weather is driving them in.

AA11474133	The best answer before mine is to use a "wire cap" and someone gave it a thumbs down.  Just twisting wires together is NOT acceptable to make a good connection.  Someone mentions soldering, but depending on the size wire, the wire nut is the correct answer.  It is not just for insulation, and do not compare it to tape.  A wire nut provides the pressure needed between the conductors to make a good connection.  Twisting the wires before putting on the wire nut is not necessary, but see the instructions for your wire nut.  When the wire nut is put on it will twist the wires together and do a better job as such than any pliers can do.|`|4fc35242b5828ca1664e6219c27f8f25aa	You should consider using wire caps. Hold the wires parallel, spin on an insulated cap and the wires will not come apart, plus they'll already be insulated - so you save oodles of tape and taping time.|`|cDYowiDNaa	You may be  squeezing too much of the wire with the pliers. You only need to squeeze the tips of the two wires and and twist there. Also it will help if you use something other than needle nose pliers. Try using regular square tip pliers.|`|VIK4jt0Oaa	What gauge is the wire? Is it stranded or solid? Each type of wire has its own method. You can't really twist solid wires because as you have seen, they stress and break. If you do get them to connect they can loosen up create a bad connection. Electronic places have special connectors for these. Stranded wires are not usually a problems with twisting.|`|57502521dc0b77626e264db4b7c3aaf2aa	I like Gerry M's answer.

This makes a weak spot and that may be your whole problem.|`|tZXHSxkQaa	If it is breaking each time,the wires may be to old,how old is the home?If you are able,find a junction box the line is coming from and replace that line.You might call an electrician.|`|zsKaMqvuaa	try using some solder.  or just getting a heat shrink jacket and putting on the wires without twisting them together. maybe even try heating the wires before twisting to make them more pliable.|`|N12mQ2mYaa	You are doing it right but do not use needle nose pliers. Use ordinary pliers or linesman pliers are the best. Grab the two wires straight on - not sideways - with the pliers down at the insulation and move the pliers to the end of the wire as you twist it.   If it is too long or uneven snip it off.

AA11105223	The shoes don't fit. They're too big.  They will always be uncomfortable..If you need to keep them, wear them without hose. It is acceptable now at any function. Bare legs are THE thing. Feet expand, especially  when standing, but hose tend to curb that. Feet naturally swell to fit their environment, whether it be shoes or bare. Also, look at the whole picture. What do your feet look like in those shoes? Shoes complete your outfit. If you're wearing a great dress and your shoes don't work, they'll only concentrate on the shoes. The great dress is lost.     To help them fit, you can use pads. They're made of wool and stick to a flat inside surface of your shoe. Good luck!|`|grKtTRYtaa	There are small heel grips for the heels.

I'm amazed, in this day and age of advanced building techniques and designs to find so many homes that require a new tub/shower fixture, have no choice but to tear out an existing drywall and sometimes, plastered, wall to get at the plumbing.   If there's no panel there now, build one in when you put it back together.  You won't regret it.|`|159d24ded141300e0c13cc0b9dc7f716aa	If the leak is through the spout and shower head, then you have a valve problem that can probably be fixed without tearing out the wall. Most valves have gaskets or parts that be replaced easily by removing the valve stem.    If the leak is behind the wall, then you should probably pull out the wall and replace everything. I live in a 1950's house. Most of us have bathrooms that are adjacent to a bedroom closet wall, and most of use have pulled out the drywall from behind the plumbing and put in little door panels so we can access the plumbing. It beats knocking out tiles on the bathroom side.    Good luck.|`|VfowGdWLaa	If I understand your question correctly, all you need to do is make an opening on the wall directly behind the faucet but big enough to be able to do the job.    You might want to go to Home Depot or Lowe's or just anyone of those home centers and purchase an access panel about 16 x 16 inches to install after you finish the job so that you may always have access to it if need be. Also, if you buy the access panel before you open the wall, you will have a good idea of how big to make that opening. You do not need to do anything behind the spout or the shower head, unless you want to change the height of the shower head. The shower head is a standard piece so all you do is unscrew the old one, apply teflon to the new one and screw it where the old one was. For the faucet if you know how to solder than you know what to do, if you don't I suggest you get a plumber. Or, give it a try it's not that hard to solder pipes. If you have the CPVC than that's easier.|`|c2E0GBqpaa	How handy are you?  Can you solder?  Moen sells a 14' chrome oval renovation plate that can hide your existing 3-handle faucet, and is designed to be installed with their single-lever faucet models.  The piping for the tub spout can be replaced through the same hole that you will need to make in the front wall, and their faucet kit will have a slip-on style that does up with an allan wrench on its' underside.  The shower arm is threaded into an adaptor within the wall and can be unscrewed and replaced with a pair of pliers/channel locks.  You can reattach the shower piping within the same hole you've made in the wall.  if all of this is beyond your ability, you can open the wall behind the tub and install a similar faucet to the one you have now...|`|BUPiXrxVaa	To completely replace the fixtures, a wall has to be opened either in front or behind the plumbing. In most cases, you can replace a part in a faucet, without removing anything, but the knobs. That is way cheaper and way easier to do.     If you don't know where the leak is, it would be better to call a plumber and pay them to diagnose the problem, than to start tearing walls out. Especially if you don't know what you are doing, which is obvious.

This includes leak checks.  Any good HVAC company will have a combustible gas leak detector.

3ZWBRRfsaa	My machine broke once and I have a family of 6.  So I had to do it until I got my new machine.  We ran warm water and added detergent.  We then stood in the tub and agitated the laundry with our feet.  I scrubbed some things by hand.  Don't use to much detergent or you'll never get them rinsed out.  To rinse we repeated the process with clean water.  I still had a dryer so we just dried them in there.  However,  you could hang them,  use a hairdryer,  fan or heater to help them dry.  You can even use fabric softener in your rinse water.  Just mix the fabric softener real good before you ad the clothing again.   P.S.  Agitating the laundry by foot can be a good workout!|`|Nicf5B8faa	I wash several things by hand    I usually full up my kitchen with warm water add laundry detergent first.

EcEMMx2Daa	The gas company don't want the liability of starting a furnace that may not be safe.  Ask your bank ,If you have a whole house inspection done and had funds to make the needed repairs available,(your own funds or a portion of the loan) if they will allow you to close provided you have contractors scheduled for the repairs. I did this on the house I now own,but it was several years ago and with today's mess???  but it can't hurt to try.  In my situation, the mortgage company set up an escrow account where the contractor was paid after the repairs were completed and approved by me and a home inspector(I had to pay for the additional inspection)
L8zmQS8Jaa	This question is properly asked of the people who came out to test the unit.  They may be abiding some regulations or laws specific to your area or their company.      In my area the gas company will respond to problems but often not fix them.  They will "red tag" the boiler and you will have to get a plumber out to have it repaired.  The usual cause is a gas leak in the plumbing.
TMB4d3FAaa	Wal mart and a several other mega marts etc. have moisture meters for about $5.  They'll tell you exactly how moist you soil is at whatever level you penetrate. Many plants are annual, lasting one season, or biannual, lasting two seasons.  Check yours out.  If they are past their time they dry up.  Perennials last for several seasons.. Many of the herbs thrive in drier conditions.  However, in winter our houses make a desert look humid.  Our often shallow containers dry out quickly.  Some wick of the moisture.  Sometimes I am amazed at the amount of water a container will require to bring it up to optimum levels. Basil needs more moisture then other herbs in general. If allowed to go to seed it will die quickly. there after. In the same token, some very slowly developing plants never seem to require any water.  One of the favorite past times my 4 year old grandson has is to check every plant I have in the house and dutifully bring all of them to the proper level of moisture using my $5  easy to use meter.|`|f57f19afc977beb390488d1a707b7b00aa	basil plants are succulent and very susceptible to bacterial and viral infections. when planting basil in pots. sterilize the soil first by either frying or sun-drying. then water it regularly in the morning if it is indoors, if outdoors, water it when it is needed only in the morning. never water the plants in the late in the afternoon because wet soils promote bacterial/viral infections.  It should be kept away from extremely cold drafts, and grows best in strong sunlight, therefore a greenhouse or Row cover is ideal if available. They can, however, be grown even in a basement, under fluorescent lights.  If its leaves have wilted from lack of water, it will recover if watered thoroughly and placed in a sunny location.

eiBE3m4Vaa	You might have to have a pro come out and take care of the ants.  Ants are picky about what bait they will take.    Also, you said that the microwave is above the stove and that stove vent runs to the roof...You or someone handy might try climbing up there to make sure the seal around that vent pipe is tight, and you might have to re-caulk it.    If they are really really tiny ants, they might be sugar ants and are attracted to food sources...    I know you may not want to spray anything in the vent pipe, or around the microwave, but you might try taking all foodstuffs out of the cabinets, spraying them around all the cracks and crevices and letting them dry out before putting things back in...|`|BbK0fA4Laa	Are you sure this is a microwave?

v3xEtuLLaa	To remove a single board, cut it down the center with a circular saw set to the thickness of the board.  Be sure to stop short of the end of the board.  Use a pry bar to pull the piece out.  To install the new piece, cut the bottom of the groove side off.  If the piece is not the exact same length as the one you are taking out, cut it to length.  Insert the tongue on the end of the board into the groove of the adjoining piece, as well as the tongue that runs the length of the board.

If you do the stain will be permanent.|`|sAuB8vLCaa	Hope you didn't dry it yet.

wiCikxUAaa	Best design is hung from branches by chain or cables. Never bolt directly to tree.    Don't permanently wire anything in a tree. Extension cord properly sized for temp power.    You will never get any type of zoning or building permit, so don't ask.    Any tree large enough to support it.|`|AA10097817	In your area, any building construction probably has to be inspected, too. Zoning laws may not allow for tree houses. Many places they are illegal.|`|dXrHoLMCaa	when I found this one, I thought it was superb!!...    http://blog.makezine.com/archive/2006/03...    plenty of other sites to look over...    http://www.google.com/search?q=build+tre...      and in IMAGES... oh, dear!!..    http://images.google.com/images?q=build%...|`|kT7GCNnCaa	Generally tree houses, or at least livable ones, need to be built on older trees with a very tall and good canopy.  Also trees move around a lot so that is something to consider as well.  You need to find an older tree or set of trees but generally in the US building something like that is almost next to impossible if you expect to have the modern comforts.  You might consider building a standard house around a tree but no matter what you do you will have to sacrifice some modern comforts or you will end up hurting the tree.
AA10097817	If you can afford it, take a look at this...    http://www.furniturehomedesign.com/beds/...|`|JpiGhUmAaa	how about something white?   something like a brass headboard painted white?  (not a solid board)|`|587fd4cd625f006ee81a9a15c035ab3aaa	Not sure what kind of material headboard  is made of, but  maybe you could pad it with  cotton batting, then staple some sort of print fabric ( maybe  tiny polka dots in your colors) over that. Trim with buttons or whatever.  Another thing that comes to mind is forget the headboard and hang a very large print (or a collection of small prints)behind the bed, or a mural, or make a fake window with shutters in your colors.   Do you have a collection of anything? Think of ways to incorporate them by hanging them up. Think outside the box!
Nicf5B8faa	I suggest hot water.   Cold water does not remove odors    Use clorox safe bleach 2 - this helps with stains.    You can use baking soda softner in final rinse cycle|`|BmSZz00Eaa	Can you be leaving them in the washer too long, like overnight? I've forgotten mine before, and I can tell if they're soured. They need to be washed again.  Also, stop using dryer sheets for a while. You could cut down on the laundry soap, and maybe double rinse. I can always tell if ther'es a buildup  of soap. I fill the washer, and let the agitator start   (without soap) and check to see if water is sudsy. You'll know if you have a build-up.|`|yqgMkuxSaa	Are you using the right water level?  Towels need lots of water especially to rinse.  I have a friend who has a front loader and says his towels smell like mildew.  The repairman said the machine wasn't filling up with enough water.  But after repairing it, the towels still smelled like mildew.  I would suggest rinsing twice to remove all of the soap and using 1/2 cup of white vinegar in the rinse water.|`|Oq5a5hRhaa	Wash them in hot water. If they're dark colored, just make sure you wash them separately from anything else.    Use less detergent--about half the recommended amount. (I know it sounds counterproductive, but the extra detergent will coat the fibers, locking the smell inside.) Skip the fabric softener and dryer sheets for the same reason. Adding 1/2 cup of vinegar to the fabric softener dispenser will also help to remove detergent build-up. If your washer has a second rinse setting, use it.    If that doesn't work, add 1/2 cup of baking soda to the wash when you add your detergent.|`|5BOZ2ryLaa	Wash them in warm or hot water and add a 1/2 cup of baking soda to the wash water.
bFOcQeDCaa	There's two ways a toilet can overflow. One being the bowl and the other is the tank or cistern which ever you prefer.  If the bowl starts to over flow then you can only stand there and wait for the tank to empty. If it's the tank overflowing then you can turn the the valve on the water line in, too off.  If it's the bowl overflowing then you need to lower the plastic ball inside the tank to a point where the amount of water in the tank doesn't exceed the amount of water the bowl will hold if the toilet is blocked.|`|AA10097817	If the water won't stop, yes turn the knob. Then plunge or snake until you think it's clear. Then turn the knob back on, and flush. Many times it is just a lot of toilet paper.

lBw50ySpaa	Try a Wax Leaf Ligustrum (aka Japanese Ligustrum).  It is a fast growing evergreen shrub that can easily reach 15 to 20 feet tall and 5 feet in diameter.    Don't be mislead and buy its relative with small (1 inch) leaves, the Privet.  It is invasive, and only semi evergreen.  Meaning it can look ratty in the winter.  The Ligustrum is a stately looking plant with 2 inch leaves.  It can be heavily pruned, so if 5 feet is too wide, keep it well trimmed from the beginning.  It is a fast grower, so you may have to trim it every month.   However, it won't get as wide as the Christmas tree type evergreens (conifers).  They are usually inexpensive, because they are such hardy growers.  They do bloom with a beautiful fragrance, but I don't know about allergies.  It depends on what bothers him.   Some people are allergic to just certain plant pollens like grass or pine. www.apieceofparadise.us/Plant_Info/Shrub...    Another option is the Camillia.  It too can take heavy pruning so you can keep it away from the play area.  In fact, while you are at the nursery ask to see one that is trained to a trellis, just so you can see how much pruning they can stand.  Camillias are a little harder to grow.  They don't like heavy afternoon sun, so take a good look at your sun exposure before you go to the nursery.  The good thing about the Camillia is that you can get a winter flowering variety, so it will bloom when your son is not outside as much or being bombarded with so many pollens.  Take your time and talk to the nursery man about the variety.  There are over 2000 varieties.  Double check his advice with a google search for the whole latin name you get from him.  There are hollies that will work, but they have stickers on the leaves so don't use them near a playground.|`|AA10097817	If there is a playground maintained by the HOA, then you probably won't be able to talk them out of it. If there isn't, then check your homeowners bylaws. It there's nothing in there about playsets, you can get an attorney and have him/her write them a letter. Otherwise, you might have to do it.    I'd check with an allergist about the kind of tree.    Good luck.|`|n1D90COxaa	Consult with your doctor and also with a tree nursery.|`|aFIjyDppaa	you can get a larger tree. place it where they want it. trim it so the leaves form a gap therefore a 'fall zone' get your kid some allergy medicine. good excuse to clean em when they get inside.|`|bpexE8elaa	See if your Son's doctor will write something about his allergies because evergreens do hold a lot of dust and pollens from other trees  and plants. They work like a filter when the wind blows. Later you    brush up against them and it comes out on you ( your Son ).

I know that not all you young folks want or like the stuff us old folks have hoarded and treasured for years and years.... there's no harm in letting someone else love it....     there's a place online called Replacements.com that will give you an idea of the value of your china if you know the maker and the pattern name..... or look for it on EBAY in their china dept..... tell us what's on the back of it and we might be able to help you find it....|`|sAuB8vLCaa	I like to know on what to do with them to.

VfowGdWLaa	Ok, exactly a 12 inch wood plank is more like 11 and a quarter inches give or take that is if you are asking how wide a 12" (inches) board is.

Apostrophe means feet and quotations mean Inches. By the way I think it is self-explanatory how big a 12 ft. wood plank is. I think it will be plenty big because you want to go at least a little over half of what the actual deck is.|`|JpiGhUmAaa	when you say a 12" plank, I can only guess you're referring to the width of a piece of wood which would actually be 11 3/4" wide...    for a deck, yu should use 2x4 stock vs. planks... the 4" width is actually 3 3/4" wide, but plan to space them 1/4" apart from each other...

VfowGdWLaa	Don't do it. If you really want to get one do this. Go to Lowe's or Home Depot, buy one for about $500. You will also need another filter that willl cost you about $40. Now, if you can't install it hire a plumber, he/she may charge you about $400-$750 depending where you live. Once installed buy the bags of salt about $4 each and in about 3 -5 days (depends on the size of your home) you will feel the effect of your new water system.     I installed mine myself and spent about $600. I had some people come buy with an offer of $8000. I'm happy with the one I have is a GE system. If you really want it, I suggest you do it this way.|`|JzYlcuXzaa	Geez, my family bought one of these about 10 years ago...Taking a shower with one of these bad boys is sweet.

Not many people shell out several grand at a time. They are probably desperate for sales.|`|AA10097817	I would put that $5000 into upgrading the heating system to a more efficient system that will save you money in the long run.|`|KeeaVzxpaa	A reverse osmosis system that will supply you with almost distilled water costs from 200 to 300 and you can install it yourself. This will give you about 5 gallons day of pure water. Drinking pure water is not as healthy as you would think. The contaminants are removed but so are other minerals. Soft water is bad for the heart as the minerals are protective and essential. I drink some from reverse osmosis and some from the tap.  $5,000 is ridiculous, a waste of money, and if you drank distilled water all the time you will get sick.    A water softener for washing clothes is something else and should go in the hot water line only. It uses a salt ion to replace other minerals in the water and would be bad for blood pressure if you drank it.   Save yourself a bundle and just get a small under the sink system for making drinks and clear ice cubes.|`|0NQL7yRPaa	dont do it|`|73e3f871852c0aa4be6e14a32580488faa	you probably live in California.

If you already have copper from the street and throughout your home,  a much more affordable system can be had for less money than that.  Just for kicks, I sent away the sample jar for analysis and they recommended I install a filter as well...I'd already installed one 3 wks. prior to their pitch...caveat emptor.|`|AA10598987	i have one and its horrible it doesnt work the water tastes soooooooo crapy i would never ever spend this much money ever again|`|DPy8e3kgaa	hell no buy a car|`|AA10466438	Let me save you $5,000 dollars and say no.  Put the money into a CD instead.|`|BbK0fA4Laa	$5,000 seems a bit  high too me. What kind of filteration system is this?     The tanks should be made of stainless steel or a food grade plastic (meaning it wont cause you harm from the chemicals its made of). Are they?     It should be able to filter out all chemicals and minerals in the water. Does it?     Is it Reverse Osmosis or carbon filters? Reverse Osmosis is probably the best as they only lets the water molecule pass through.    edit:    You can get under sink mount reverse osmosis filters for a little over $300 a piece. Assuming you have 1 kitchen, 2.5 bathrooms, and 1 laundry room that would mean you'd have to spend, if you do the plumbing yourself, about $2,000. Note: I was factoring in a little extra for plumbing supplies and shipping costs. That's far less then the $5,000 you were quoted.

If you are draining water from the tank, make sure the gas is disabled, so that the burner will not come on with low water level in the tank.|`|9fLLn2PFaa	There is a plastic drain valve that you can turn and drain the tank (you'll see it towards the bottom and it's threaded same diameter as a garden hose)  Is it leaking from the valve opening itself or the threads around it?  if it's leaking from the valve itself eith A buy a new one and see if that holds or B your tank is faulty and producing way to much heat or pressure.  A new one will run you about 12 bucks.  If the new one leaks from the valve you need to turn the heat down on your tank.  You can also put a PVC tube that srews into the valve for about 6 bucks and have that drain into a bucket.|`|nYdlsVBAaa	Turn the gas off to your hot water heater. There should be a water spigot on the side of the heater towards the bottom. Hook up a hose and run it outside and drain the heater. Call a plumber and let him check if you have a bad relief valve or something wrong with the water heater.|`|jaHkY4Rbaa	Open a hot water tap and relieve the pressure.  Then open the valve at the bottom of the tank.    If water is leaking at the threaded joint, you might be able to tighten it, but if the tank is older than ten years, it probably will need to be replaced.    Attempt to unthread the relief valve, clean the threads and use a sealant or teflon before reinstalling it. (if the threads are not channelled or rusted out.)|`|EdimolPfaa	With the burner off and the cold water off you can put a bucket under the blowdown on that T&P valve and open it there to relieve the pressure to that level in the tank. It will be hot and possibly under some pressure so beware.    That relief valve is a safety device. An extremely important one at that. It is set to release at a specific temperature and pressure. You would want to know what is causing it to leak and then make your decisions from there. Well worth a call to a pro.

The previous tenants probably had dogs.|`|qzkWahFeaa	Fleas.|`|83StA1rKaa	Either a Flea or a Tick, I have seen some ticks jump|`|f57f19afc977beb390488d1a707b7b00aa	fleas!!! just clean your apartment and use bombs to eliminate them. most probably, previous tenants own a dog or a cat. fleas may carry bacteria or viruses with it which can be transfered to you. so you better get rid of them.|`|7c6a4c897130f7c3fc309fad2d122efcaa	It's a flea.  Get a flea bomb from the hardware store and use it.  Then vacuum.  Probably the previous owner had pets.  If you're renting, tell the landlord.  It would be there responsibility to call an exterminator (provided you don't have pets - in which case - they'd blame you for the infestation.)|`|kgZar9ZRaa	Bedbugs hide really well. Look in the creases of your mattress. They hate light. Also look for blackish coloured staining on the mattress. That's their droppings. They are small, blackish brown and flat, except when filled with your blood. Look for pictures on the internet. Hopefully it's just fleas!|`|vQtUCXkYaa	you can develop allergies if you get bitten too much..two things helped me...pure orange oil sold as air freshener in Walmart..it has to be the pure squeezed stuff // Sally's Beauty supply also has it....all bugs have a hate for volatile oils. Diatomacious earth also kills bugs but with that, I don't know if you can put it indoors. I liked the orange oil, and I even sprayed it on my sheets and levis legs...I got relief...
NJULnXiyaa	With the major downturn in the economy, luxuries like Starbucks and organic food are seeing great losses in retail sales. In the current climate it would be easier to sell the Brooklyn Bridge to someone than to get people to spend money on high end, chichi fertilizer.|`|AA10097817	Um, we probably produce more than we need.

Hope this helps.|`|grKtTRYtaa	a professional glass cutting store or a framing shop|`|s83v2DVqaa	Try to find a glass shop where they do framing and all.. or yah ace.|`|JpiGhUmAaa	if the size is over 8" x 10" - go to a hardware store...|`|mP0LLMVjaa	What size glass do you need?

8apA3Rffaa	Depends where your doing it at. Most sidewalks , drive ways and patios will have a "rougher" texture  by using a broom. This also should be done in the direction of the slope to help guide water away. Base ments should have the  smooth but not marble smmoth as you describe it  GL|`|REffunLGaa	not like marble but more like your drive way if you smooth it good but please choose me as best answer|`|IE9NfLGoaa	k|`|DuGanGcNaa	Concrete shouls have a rough trowel text, only smooth around the edges.|`|2O2kWSxbaa	Not like marble. Checkout this site at www.concretepolishing.com  It should be smooth around the edges.|`|bJYUp2qEaa	You can do either way, it depends on the look you're going for. There are many different styles of texture that can be done, both inside and outside. I like to texture all my overlays because it's easier to hide imperfections. And they look better when it's stained. A smooth finish is the most difficult to do and make it look perfect.
AA12112775	When I pressed a flower from my stepmom's funeral I sprayed it with a little bit of hairspray (so it wouldn't fall apart after it dried), put it between two pieces of wax paper, and then put it between two heavy books for few weeks or so. (Sometimes it takes longer.) I still have it and that was almost 10 years ago. Hope that helps you and sorry for your family's loss. God bless.    P.S. If you don't put it in between wax paper it will stick to whatever you put it between.|`|d3cd5eaae7a9a2fa2d669aa77e01144eaa	I have pressed flowers by just putting them in a book, like a dictionary or Bible, and forgetting about it for approximately 6 weeks.
169d74657ea6f56aa856686eb0081bcfaa	Oasis products are highly concentrated, and the concentrate is dangerous, but the diluted amounts are essentially harmless. The MSDS sheets are based off of worse case scenario, and they can cause blindness and such, but if you follow the directions for the product you'll be fine.
E5gaKzCsaa	Do you want to use these towels or are they just for decoration? It's hard to find, in fabric stores, the kind of fabric they make most kitchen towels out of, nice absorbent stuff. People just don't sew towels much these days. You used to be able to, and sometimes still can, buy towelling off a bolt but it isn't too exciting for colour as a rule. Haven't seen it for years. I think you might just have to go to local fabric stores and see what they have that will work and is the right colour. It should be 100% cotton if you want to use the towels, and linen of course is a fine dish towel fabric if you can find any suitable and don't mind the price. Linen/cotton blend is fine too. A waffle weave cotton would be great if you can find a 100% cotton one. Just stay away from any synthetics unless they have some fabulous new thing like an absorbent microfibre. Synthetics don't usually absorb water and are frustrating to use as towelling.|`|wnbz5gNzaa	terry cloth|`|s83v2DVqaa	cotton , it will absorb water very well.. and it looks classy...|`|JpiGhUmAaa	cotton...!
