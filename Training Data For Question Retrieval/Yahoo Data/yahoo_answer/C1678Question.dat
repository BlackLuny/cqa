WHY COULDNT THE AIRLINE PUT THESE PEOPLE UP IN HOTELS!! i mean some slept in o hare for 2 days! What did the airlines do for these people? Why were they in the airport that long and IF I AM STUCK IN THE AIRPORT For around 10 hours or more I WILL PUT MY FOOT DOWN ABOUT BEING STUCK IN THE AIRPORT AND TRY TO BE UPFRONT WITH THE AIRLINE FRONT DESK ABOUT IT. I would rather be at my destination, duh!!!         I was stuck in Manchester-Boston airport for 8-9 hours due to my flight get cancelled and delayed over and over to O hare (all other flights out of manchetser were not cancelled and this was in June) and I ALMOST BAILED OUT OF THE TRIP and was going to opt to go another, time I should have done that as I lost a lot of my trip, but they said they were at the mercy of the weather in o hare (They had thunderstorms and tornadoes) and if I bailed out and opted to go another time would I have been charged a fee of rescheduling? From now on if I am supposed to get to my destination either early or late morning and I have been delayed soo much that I know I wont get there till at least 3 pm I WILL STOP THE TRIP AND GO ANOTHER TIME! (I only get 2 days off in a row of work a week)      can anyone really be stuck in an airport for days and how??? and also how can weather cause someone to be stuck that long and which weather elements will do that.        I dont get how this woman was stuck in Chicago for 3 days when she missed a layover when transfering through O HARE!!!!! why couldnt they put her on a flight??? 3 days!!! if that was me I would not be happy. Waht if I tell the strewdress on the plane of a short layover I have and I have to get off the plane as soon as possible, will it fall out of one ear? IF I was in that womans shoes would they put me up in a hotel?

I hear story after story, about security in airports raiding luggage and stealing things people bring from Cuba. My mother recently came from a trip to Cuba and when she got here, security searched though her bag and took all she brought. I think this is abuse and the sole purpose of it being done, is so the personnel in the airports can have a nice drink of our cuban wine or make a profit by selling something we paid for. They stole 3 bottles of wine, 4 bottles of rum, bag of peppers and 6 bottles of medication from my mother in Miami International Airport, they even laughed while they did this, they must have been happy imagining the nice drinks they were going to have that night. If anyone knows about reporting this, or somewhere we can complain please let me know.

20090131162557AAzjrok	Travel;Europe (Continental);Greece	Can Lacryma Christi be made in Greece?	My friend just came back home from visiting her relatives in Crete.  Because she is good friend and knows how much I like good and unique wines, she brought back a very special and very tasty beverage called Lacryma Christi.    I do enjoy the wine to the extreme.  But there is one problem and I need the help of Greeks to solve it.    Before she left, she ask me what I want and I said "Just something original from the island of Crete".  I did an Internet search and here is the information I find about the wine.    "Lacryma Christi, (also Lachryma Christi, literally "tear of Christ"), is the name of a celebrated Neapolitan type of wine produced on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius in Campania, Italy.    The name Lacryma Christi comes from an old legend that Christ, crying over Lucifer's fall from heaven, cried his tears on the land and gave divine inspiration to the vines that grew there. The sides of Vesuvius are deeply scarred by past lava flows, and its lower slopes are extremely fertile, dotted with villages and covered with vineyards.    The red is garnet in color with a pleasant scent of red fruit and white pepper and a juicy, tart flavor with apple-skin flavors and lemony acidity in balance".     Now help me please.  Is it import from Italy to Crete or is is the "Real McCoy" made in Greece?

I heard that when doing however many subjects at A level you have to get that many As to get into oxford, e.g AAA out of 3 subjects AAAA out of 4 and tht AAA is better than AAAB because it is a perfect score, and doesnt mean you couldnt have got AAAA if you did 4. is this always the case at oxford? or does it depend on subjects or whether you just did a subject because you liked it rather than the fact you would get an A. im pretty sure i can get AAA in maths phys and further maths, but i like chemistry and i am not sure i will get an A. specific requirements from universities would be great.

20090131164155AAAZGTv	Travel;Air Travel	I Wondered of that situation   ?	here is why I ask of this experience of this woman, when I flew from Manchester to Phoenix and the connector flight was to Phili and it said to the people for San Francisco to see gate agents and I asked a woman why that is and she said the ones to san francisco wont make it. HAVE ANY OF you missed your final destination as the layover between planes in a connector flight was too short. What will they do to get you to your destination sooner if that happens. AND THE WOMAN WHO I ASked what they ment by passengers see gate agent told me she missed her destination due to a short layover and was stuck in Chicago for 3 days. WHY 3 DAYS COULDNT THEY PUT HER ON ANOTHER FLIGHT. I WOULD BE MAD AT THE front desk if they caused me to be in teh airport that long.   again if you miss her final destination flight due to a short layover, will you get vouchers and will they get you on another flight the same day. I fear it will happen to me and if I am at the airport for 10 hours or more, their a is grass. what if I went on the trip on my 2 days off in a row (or on the 3 day weekend like 4th of July) and I am marooned in the airport the whole time I was scheduled to do my trip (And the day it looks like I will arrive is the same time its time to head home) and I never got to my trip, will they refund my money and or give me mileage vouchers to help me do the trip I was to do another time. I DONT WANT THE TRIP I WOULD GO TO TO BE THE TRIP THAT NEVER WAS! DOES THAT MEAN I WILL LOSE MY WHOLE TRIP. What If I wanted to go on my trip and never got there and then wanted to go some other time, will they give me the money to do it or DID I WASTE Like a 300 to 400 dollar ticket and let that be the trip that never was. IF I miss my final destination, my luggage will take off without me. And what if I tell the stewdress of my short layover in the plane, will it fall out of one ear.

My main concern is finding a place to live and getting a job, oh and being able to afford it all. How much would I need to budget for rent/food etc? How easy is it to find a job?

Where am I more likely to find a job? Sorry for the flood of questions but I'm clueless!   Thanks!
