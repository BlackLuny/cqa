The bottom line is that all proxy's will eventually get blocked.

It's honestly not worth the tough repercussions involved.<br>  There are plenty of sites your computer will allow that are far better than that, and worth your time. Attempting to dodge security software processors will land you in sharp consequences.<br>  They are blocked for several reasons, and there is no changing that.

It has the modernized look, have you seen the difference between the Vista and XP task bar. There is a HUGE difference.<br>  Vista task bar has so many nice features like the Flip programs in 3D. It looks better.<br>  XP task bar has the old 2000 look, it has a low quality, mediocre look.<br>  For example, the start button looks like its about to blow up, and the blue look is old.<br>  XP requires you to download those programs that you don't want.<br>  <br>  Going to the Vista backgrounds: The Vista Backgrounds are very beautiful looking, except the Aurora which is the default. The backgrounds are extremely beautiful. The XP backgrounds are boring the only nice one is the default which is the Bliss (i think)<br>  The new Vista start menu has a nice look such as the two columns which lets you see you documents programs, without making a huge mess.<br>  The transparency bar has a modern look, you can make you entire desktop look 3D, especially with Google Chrome. The Sidebar has gotten a couple of bad reviews, because people say it takes up alot of space. Not many people use the sidebar because it takes space.<br>  <br>  The new icons are nice, and modernized, while the XP desktops icons are old, and its hard to see.<br>  <br>  So why don't you XP fans go and try out Vista.<br>  <br>  IF YOU WOULD LIKE A NICE, GOOD LOOKING, AFFORDABLE LAPTOP, THEN READ THIS.<br>  Try this!<br>  HP Pavilion dv 4, is an excellent laptop.<br>  My mother has it, it has excellent features. <br>  Go to this url<br>  <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?...</a><br>  <br>  My mother got it from Best Buy for a lovable price.<br>  This laptop has a web cam and a built-in-microphone.<br>  The web cam has those techy and nice effects like the ones you can find in Mac, the program is called Cyberlink YouCam.<br>  (I am looking at it right now)<br>  It has a HDMI port, 1 microphone jack, 2 headphone jacks or speakers.<br>  SD Card slot.<br>  Touch button ( the forward reverse, volume up and down, play and pause, and wifi turn on or off.)<br>  Let me tell you the Wifi is very good.<br>  I got wifi from across my street, and let me just tell you my street is big.<br>  Its about 3 - 5 pounds.<br>  So you decide, and i recommend this laptop.<br>  O.k. have a nice day,sir.<br>  About the speakers, its loud, usually we keep it on 50% but seriously you can blast your speakers and it can make some loud noises!<br>  and it has a 3D sound.<br>  It includes 64 bit version of VISTA<br>  <br>  Excellent laptop|`|NkbhHcIAaa	Anyone who claims Vista is a good operating system is a complete damn IDIOT . <br>  <br>  any how to your question , IF your system is meeting your needs for now I would wait , Microsoft is already working on a replacement for Vista ( wow a great operating system less then 18 months old and being replaced ) called Windows 7 .

Just wait until you get home.|`|FgsRcuDpaa	Let's initially establish: Proxies are not a requirement.<br>  There is nothing that important that you have to circumvent the internet filter that can't wait until school/work is dismissed. If you are discovered using the school/company computers for restricted sites, you will endure severe consequences. It's honestly not worth the tough repercussions involved.<br>  There are plenty of sites your computer will allow that are far better than that, and worth your time. Attempting to dodge security software processors will land you in sharp consequences.<br>  They are blocked for several reasons, and there is no changing that. With the multitude of computer viruses spreading around, companies cannot take any chances.<br>  Bypassing the filters set-up by companies is near impossible. The major Web security gateway software processors are pretty well impenetrable.|`|PoJETtibaa	Try <a href="http://www.notmuchtoseehere.co.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.notmuchtoseehere.co.uk</a> :).|`|AA10953648	<a href="http://batmanrocks.info" rel="nofollow">http://batmanrocks.info</a><br>   <a href="http://jokerisalive.com" rel="nofollow">http://jokerisalive.com</a><br>   <a href="http://catonmat.info" rel="nofollow">http://catonmat.info</a><br>   <a href="http://snapit.info" rel="nofollow">http://snapit.info</a><br>   <a href="http://yahoothat.info" rel="nofollow">http://yahoothat.info</a><br>   <a href="http://yahoothis.info" rel="nofollow">http://yahoothis.info</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   To get fresh proxies right in to your inbox as they are created,<br>  join the group  <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/getaproxy/join">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/getap...</a> <br>  <br>   I mail fresh proxies everyday.,so that you don't have to ask ne1 nemore :-)|`|1bef9V3jaa	try  these proxy:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.timemove.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.timemove.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.globalfaster.tk" rel="nofollow">http://www.globalfaster.tk</a><br>  www.timebypass.cn<br>  www.serverfast.info<br>  www.ztunnel.com<br>  <br>  <br>  You can also join this group to receive fresh proxies every week in your email inbox :<br>  <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/listproxyku/join">http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/listp...</a>|`|dOMzkQIraa	<a href="http://chronicle.com/free/v55/i17/17a00901.htm" rel="nofollow">http://chronicle.com/free/v55/i17/17a009...</a>|`|opT8Uc8Paa	go to google and type in myspace.com and it will say at the bottom catch...click that and sign in. <br>  unfortuntly you can only check messages and see pictures|`|9b0a04d9a5a6e39d0997d773f7b49e09aa	cant tell you. it`s secret

0m1PMsHaaa	No.<br>  <br>  The problem is not the monitor refresh rate.  60 Hz is fine for an LCD.  This is the same refresh rate as HD TV.   The problem is probably either your internet connection, or your system's ability to scale the video up to 1920 by 1080.<br>  <br>  Try running the video in a smaller window.

Its user interface is very innovative and natural with interchangeable tabs that can also be pulled out to convert them to a new window.

In addition, the browser crashes in some websites constantly, so I'm forced to use another browser for those sites. The number of sites I have had problems with is not very high (perhaps a 2%), and I hope this issue is resolved in the following versions of chrome.

6Djqii7Xaa	I don't recall seeing anything on how to increase the router signal strength. Strength of the encryption algorithm, yes, but not signal. It would be helpful to know why you want to do that.<br>  <br>  Even though you cannot increase the actual number of watts (milliwatts actually), there are other things you can do depending on the type of wireless you have, and I presume you are talking about a wireless here. You can get aftermarket hi-gain replacement antennas that will make it appear you have a strong signal, but those will only work with routers with external antennas. You can also make home grown reflectors to make the antennas directional and concentrate the power in a specific direction.<br>  <br>  If you are talking about increasing the signal over the ethernet cable, then you need to talk about repeaters. The signal strength along the cable is set at a level that will match the capabilities of the type of cable in use to prevent "crosstalk" between the the wires and things like that, so it is best to leave it alone and just use a repeater to boost strength along a cable run.|`|JAwe9PyAaa	simple answer is that you cannot increase the routers strength.|`|MZ1DRSflaa	Move closer to the router.<br>  =<br>  Power  output cannot be increased.

pUzJiMUcaa	Ebay has a lot of measures in place to go against scammers....of course, they don't always work very well...but I wouldn't report this one.<br>  <br>  Ebay won't do anything about them, they are not breaking any of the terms of service. If the person does not deliver the goods paid for, Ebay and Paypal both have ways to accommodate the buyer.<br>  <br>  Personally, I would never bid on an item from a zero, and out of the country. If the others want to take the risk, it will be up to them to report the scam, if and when it happens. Reporting anything now will just clutter up the reporting system, and make it more difficult to get to the scams that are proven, and happening.|`|e2HW9iQ5aa	I don't see someone scamming at all. I wouldn't bid because of the things you said, but there is nothing wrong with it.<br>  <br>  1. $15 for shipping - there are no rules for this. You can charge whatever you want for shipping. In fact a lot of people sell an item cheaply, and then make their money on shipping. As long as they charge you what is says, it's your decision if you want to pay it/bid or not.<br>  <br>  2. Stock photo - Again, nothing against the rules on this, as long as it's LABELED a stock photo. Which it is. I would never buy it with a stock photo. But, it's not illegal.<br>  <br>  3. No feedback score - everyone has to start with 0. Again, I wouldn't buy from a 0, but not illegal.<br>  <br>  4. Same people bidding - I don't see that. out of 6 bids, there are 4 different bidders. The ones with the same name together is because of automated bids.<br>  <br>  No. I don't see anything scamming or illegal, and you shouldn't report the person.|`|t5sYXwSqaa	If you are really suspicious then you can report it to ebay, however what you report looks fairly normally. He/she maybe a one off seller that explains the lack of reviews and stock photo. Shipping is dependent on size of item etc and a lot of ebay's do try to make something from the postage as they are never sure what the item may go for. It is also normal for the same people to bid. Any auction depends on the same several people bidding against each other. Not everyone at an auction bids for the same thing, just the few who really want it. Thjis is particularly true at the beginning of an ebay auction as real bidders do not tend to come in until  60 minutes before the bidding time ends.|`|AA10551195	I'm going to go with Scott B. I looked over your link, and found nothing wrong. I've been an eBayer for 8 years and I had to start somewhere, too. There are no hard rules for shipping. EVERYone has raised their shipping - USPS postage is going up - when it does, all the shippers raise their rates, also. <br>  <br>  You have nothing to report. Sorry!

maI66F3Faa	What is it?<br>  Malware – short for malicious software, it is used to cause damage to a single computer, server, or computer network. Computer viruses, worms, trojan horses, most rootkits, spyware, dishonest adware, and other malicious and unwanted software are all types of malware that can infect your computer. But it is worth noting that very few malware instances are actual viruses (less than 20%).<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  What to do about it?<br>  A virus protection software is the most common tool for prevention. These scanners have “real-time protection” enabled; which scans the program before it runs and if the program has malicious code than it is stopped before the chance of execution. Common sense is another big factor in determining whether or not malware gets into your computer. If an executable computer program is attached to your e-mail and you are unsure of the source, then it should be deleted immediately. Do not download any applications or executable files from unknown sources, and be careful when trading files with other users.<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  What about some free protection?<br>  <br>  ***NOTE*** Let it be known that you must have only one virus protection / firewall working on your computer or serious conflicts will occur! You MUST un-install your current virus protection suite before continuing installing another. “But what if my old one is already expired?” It does not matter, divorce it anyway…<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  <br>  Anti-Virus…<br>  <br>  I would go with Avira.

Obviously, if you setw 10 it will make sure the last char is a null terminator.  If you setw(11) you should get ten characters plus the null terminator because it's sending str an ASCIIZ string.

To identify these components in order that they can communicate with each other to act as an autonomous system.<br>  <br>  **To manage physical & virtual memory i.e. memory manager<br>  <br>  **To manage the NTFS filing system & file indexes. <br>  <br>  **To create new files, files to be edited, for files to be moved or copied or too delete unused or old files. To write new files to the disk, save a file.<br>  <br>  **To manage network connectivity such as internet connections or LAN network connections i.e. the TCP/IP stack.<br>  <br>  **To process instructions that have been sent to the CPU or act upon instructions that come from the CPU. such as load a web page or delete a web page or close my browser. <br>  <br>  **In other words you can think of windows XP's functionality as just like the oil in a car engine, because without oil flowing through the engine at the correct temperature the car cannot work. The engine will not produce any power & XP is exactly the same. XP balances ALL these very very complex processes under the hood so too speak, it all happens out of view from the user. Its like a swan on the surface all you see is the majestic bird flowing along the river or pond but below the water its feet are working hard to move it along from A to B. windows XP is the same. <br>  <br>  Ivan<br>  <br>  computer veteran.|`|dILqe7nBaa	it is an operating system|`|8JO0o23maa	The most amazing function is its file system which is the fastest file system known as NTFS.If your drive has FAT32 file system you can convert it into NTFS without format the Hard Drive <br>  <br>  Click Start>All Programs>Accessories> then click Command Prompt.<br>  Type<br>  <br>  " convert e: /fs:ntfs "<br>  <br>  simple ;)|`|4c6eda3e43b0e1e56fefd6a571beba09aa	Its main function is to act as an interface between you and your microprocessor.

SJM0rzHtaa	That adapter will not work.<br>  <br>  A VGA-to-RCA adapter are intended for video cards with special VGA ports that can also output a composite TV signal.<br>  <br>  TV RCA outputs cannot put out a VGA signal, which is why when you attempt to use the adapter to connect an XBox's TV RCA output to a VGA monitor, you get no signal.<br>  <br>  If you have an old XBox with just TV RCA-out, you need to buy a scan converter that can translate the TV composite signal to VGA.<br>  <br>  If you have an XBox 360, all you need is an XBox HDAV VGA cable:  <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16874103025" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...</a>|`|dOMzkQIraa	The converter is the wrong way around.

pUzJiMUcaa	Me, I'm a .NET developer...here's two things I can tell you:<br>  <br>  1. I get job offers each month, without looking, just by having my name out as a .NET dev.<br>  <br>  2. I receive help-wanted updates in my email daily from various sources...every day, there is a new call for a PHP developer.<br>  <br>  Both are in demand, anywhere you go. It depends on your taste. When you start getting into the development community, you'll hear a lot of "PHP sucks" talk. To me, it doesn't suck...it just isn't as useful as .NET, and where it IS useful, you have to work harder. Maybe that's the Object Oriented Programmer in me talking...<br>  <br>  I won't say any language is definitively better than another, though. That's like saying a hammer is better than a screwdriver. Every language is unequivocally the best language for a certain job. (just like a hammer is unequivocally the best tool to drive a single nail into a wall). <br>  <br>  If you want work, you need only be a good programmer. It doesn't matter the language, you'll find a place to use it. And another misconception, while we're on it, is that all languages are so different that knowing more than one or two is not possible. Good programmers can read ANY programming language...even if they've never seen it. Give them a few weeks, and they can also write it.|`|Qm2apU5Qaa	Honestly, learn whatever the job requires. I hear people ask this question all the time, and there's no concrete answer. There are a million ways to compare a asp language and php, just as comparing java to C#.|`|KHSOVxViaa	If you're doing a small to medium web project, PHP is probably more convenient and easier.<br>  <br>  For larger projects, C#.net (.asp) is more suitable as it is an Object-Oriented (OO) language.  PHP is moving that way, but not really there yet.<br>  <br>  For jobs, there are opportunities in both, but C# .net (as well as native C++) will have higher rates for experienced programmers.|`|cYWYARmVaa	.asp and php are essentially teh same thing,<br>  <br>  asp being microsoft big expensive one, and php being the open source community one.<br>  <br>  i think in term of learning, php has a lot more resources, and free software, though|`|niCqMuRVaa	.net because php has bug and its unsecured it will hack very easy!!! you can search php bug in google|`|r8cYhqKDaa	Programming Tutorial And Project Help And <br>  Latest Jobs And Earn Money-<a href="http://techwebs.org/" rel="nofollow">http://techwebs.org/</a>

xERzGZ6Baa	Everyone knows that Windows computers can sometimes slow down over time. While not an exhaustive list of solutions to problems, this collection presents some ways to speed up a computer.<br>  <br>  1. De-Fragmenting<br>  Over time, the data on your hard drive gets scattered. Defragmenting your hard drive puts your data back into sequential order, making it easier for Windows to access it. As a result, the performance of your computer will improve.<br>   a) Right click of C Disk.<br>   b) Click properties.<br>   c) Click tools tab.<br>   d) Click "Defragment now".<br>   e) Click Defragment.<br>  <br>  2. Uninstall Unneeded Programs<br>  Removing programs that you no longer use can free up space on your computer and speed up your system's performance. However, you need to uninstall the programs properly to see much improvement; deleting them is not enough.<br>  <br>  3. Stop Programs from starting on Windows boot<br>  One way you can speed up your computer is to prevent programs from launching themselves at start-up. Not only do the unwanted programs delay the start of Windows, they also continue to slow down your computer since they use system resources.<br>   a) Open your Start menu.<br>   b) Click Run<br>   c) In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"<br>   d) In the "system configuration utility", click either "service" or "startup" tab<br>   e) Uncheck all programs that you are no longer using.<br>   f) Click "OK"<br>  <br>  4. Check for Spyware and Adware<br>  Spyware is software that allows companies to monitor what websites you visit or even access your computer. Adware is software that displays advertisements. Both use system resources and slow your computer down. Detecting and removing the programs will improve system performance.<br>  Get the best one from: <a href="http://toptenantispywareviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispywareviews.com</a> to scan your pc<br>  <br>  5.

If you using your computer for normal stuff and not gaming. You don't always need more RAM you just need to perform a few maintenance task.<br>  <br>  First, if you haven't cleaned your registry in a while. This is necessary. Your registry holds all the information regarding updates, installs, un-installs etc. Each one of those events produces a key. That key needs your PC's resources and free space. So, if you clean your registry, you make more resources available for speed. Do a registry scan if you got more than 20 errors you should clean it.<br>  <a href="http://www.delete-computer-history.com/what-is-the-best-registry-cleaner.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.delete-computer-history.com/w...</a><br>  <br>  2. Clear your Windows cache files, this is your temporary file. It can grow up to a large volume and stop your computer from using RAM properly. In a sense slow it down by preventing it from using free space.Here is how:<br>  <br>  1. Quit Internet Explorer, Firefox, or any other web browser<br>  2. Click Start, click "Control Panel", and then double-click "Internet Options".<br>  3. On the General tab, click "Delete Files" under Temporary Internet Files.<br>  4. In the Delete Files dialog box, click to select the "Delete all offline content" check box , and then click OK.<br>  5. Click OK.<br>  <br>  3. Manage your startups. Your excess CPU usage is due to too many programs running in the background. You can cut these to barebones by alter your msconfig. Here is how:<br>  <br>  1. Open your Start menu.<br>  2. Click Run<br>  3. In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"<br>  4. In the "system configuration utility",click either "service" or "startup" tab<br>  5.

g62ATenqaa	I would suggest rather than using book fold, simply go into Page Layout menu then clicki on arrow to the side of  Page Set Up make sure your page is set to A4 and change orientation to landscape.  Then set your margins to 1.27cm all round.  When you click OK you will be back on your blank page.  Insert a table, three columns 1 row. Highlight, right button of mouse down to table properties and make the first and third columns 12.3 cm wide exactly and the second column 2.5cm.  Make the row height 17.8cm exactly.<br>  Right button of mouse, down to borders and shading and click on the none box as you are using the table environment purely for convenience.  You don't say how many pages you are going to have but I would suggest before you start typing anything on your page, get some blank sheets, fold them in half then number the pages because you will see that as you turn over the pages, what you think should be page 3, will actually be on another sheet of paper so this is important so you can see what order you are gong to input stuff into your booklet. You will use the first column then the third, the centre column is purely for the fold. If you didnt create this then your text would probably run into the fold.

t5sYXwSqaa	You do not say how you are trying to connect to the internet, eg via ethernet wireless? I will assume wireless as you state that you have a computer connected already. <br>  <br>  Firstly have you got a wireless cable modem router? If not you cannot connect wirelessly. (If you are connecting your first computer without wires then you do have the above). If your first computer is connected to a unit this is likely to be an ordinary broadband modem and you will not be able to connect a second computer without connecting a wireless router to the modem.<br>  <br>  Assuming you have a wireless modem router then have you a wireless card in your second computer. This could be a USB card or an internal wireless card. As you state there are no network connections, how did you establish that. You need to look at Start/Control Panel/System/Hardware/Device Manage and in that window look for network adapter. Click the + sign, if it is there and look for any cards that say wireless or 802.11a/b/g/n. If these are there then you have a wireless card. My thoughts are that you do not have a wireless card and therefore need to fit one. To be more specific I would require more information.

If you are discovered using the school/company computers for restricted sites, you will endure severe consequences. It's honestly not worth the tough repercussions involved.<br>  There are plenty of sites your computer will allow that are far better than that, and worth your time. Attempting to dodge security software processors will land you in sharp consequences.<br>  They are blocked for several reasons, and there is no changing that. With the multitude of computer viruses spreading around, companies cannot take any chances.<br>  Bypassing the filters set-up by companies is near impossible. The major Web security gateway software processors are pretty well impenetrable.

When I ran Linux, I used a program called OpenOffice.<br>  <br>  To answer your question, however, I did a google search and found a couple options for you.<br>  <br>  If you specifically want Microsoft Office and are willing to pay for it, here is Microsoft's official Mac release: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/Office2008/default.mspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/mac/products/Of...</a><br>  <br>  I can certainly understand if you don't want to pay for Microsoft Office, or more importantly, if you don't have the ability to do so.<br>  <br>  To that end, I did some digging around the internet and found NeoOffice. According to the website, it is based off OpenOffice (which I have personally used, and it's very good) but is made for the Mac. It looks like a good application. It contains the freeware versions of all the Microsoft Office applications. Here's the link:  <a href="http://www.neooffice.org/neojava/en/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.neooffice.org/neojava/en/inde...</a><br>  <br>  *note* The main reason that I decided to choose NeoOffice is that it states on this page that it has "integrated dozens of native Mac features" and anything saved in Microsoft Office formats is compatible with these programs.<br>  <br>  This link will take you to something of an advertisement for the program where you can learn about all the features of NeoOffice. At the bottom, you'll find a download link.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, just go here: <a href="http://www.neooffice.org/neojava/en/maindownload.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.neooffice.org/neojava/en/main...</a> and you can download for mac Intel machines or Mac PowerPC machines.<br>  <br>  A quick note: it asks you to donate for the software before downloading it, and of course I must recommend doing so, but note that you can skip the donation.|`|V8wgbyeSaa	There is a program that is very similar to powerpoint, and its made for mac's, its called Keynote '09. heres a link to the Apple site where you can buy it: <a href="http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/" rel="nofollow">http://www.apple.com/iwork/keynote/</a><br>  <br>  If you would like power point instead of keynote, you can buy Microsoft office for macs here: <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/mac/campaigns/ms_office_2008_landing" rel="nofollow">http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/ma...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  If you want to go the expensive but far more useful way, You can buy Mac OS X Leopard. Once you buy that, or if you already have it, then theres a program included with leopard, called Boot Camp. You can then buy Windows Vista Installation disk, and you can install windows on your mac, then if you have office on the installation disk, you're set with power point, but if you don't, you can then go buy Microsoft office somewhere.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope that helps|`|ZRs0zab4aa	get the Iwork software it comes with Pages, Numbers and Keynote<br>  <br>  Keynote is the equivalent of Powerpoint

A real can of worms you've opened here.<br>  <br>  P.C.s are cheaper to buy in the first instance, but then when you need to take it back to the store to get it repaired twice a year, it all adds up. Macs age far better, the value of a 2 year old MacBook is higher than a 2 year old Dell/HP/Sony whatever you're looking at. Macs ARE harder to infect, and even if there WERE viruses for them, you have much more control over what you install when downloading.<br>  <br>  As Apple makes the software for Apple machines, you can be sure that the specs are high enough to run the Operating System. I know people whose one year old machine was not fast enough to run the behemoth that is Windows Vista. My 3 year old MacBook is running the very latest Mac OS, because they designed the Os for my machine.<br>  <br>  Macs are not only for media programs, Windows Office is available for Mac, and they have their own version, iWork.<br>  <br>  Functionality wise, Macs are designed to be as easy and straightforward to use as possible. They come with the operating system ready installed, and are ready to work (or play) with the minute you take it out of the box.<br>  <br>  My Mac has never needed (in it's 3 year lifetime) to visit the Apple Store, but if it had, they would have repaired it for free. They have very good customer service (I know, from my iPod breaking).<br>  <br>  This post may be very Mac-centric, but I have only known Apple products for the last 10 years.

Macs have great hardware, but if it breaks, you are going to pay alot of money to get them repaired.  Not many companies like working on macs because to do the simplest maintanence, such as replacing a laptop screen, it has to be completely disassembled and often the bezel will break in the process.<br>  <br>  many people believe that MACs are immune to viruses, this is not the case.  Windows holds 80-90% of the market share, and as such, you have more viruses that target them, however, macs do have viruses that target them.  <br>  <br>  As far as functionallity, all computers with similar hardware are capable of the same things as long as the specific software has been released for that operating system.

I can even jump on the messenger if needed.<br>  <br>  Computers is what I do for a living and I can help you through the settings mentioned for your page file.|`|fE7zhp3Caa	If it's giving you the message 'excessive paging' then you're system is short of memory.  Windows uses a chunk of the hard drive to act as virtual memory to supplement actual memory when it needs more.  This hard drive chunk is called the page file, and data being moved to and from the page file is called paging.  Because the hard drive is so much slower than system memory, paging slows the system down.  If Windows has too little memory to work with it will page more than normal, slowing things down even more.<br>  <br>  Add memory and the paging should drop down to normal levels.<br>  <br>  Although the timing seems coincidental, connecting a game console to a common router won't cause problems with other devices sharing the same connection, except where all devices are connecting to the Internet at the same time and are competing for bandwidth.<br>  <br>  [edit]<br>  1GB of RAM for Vista isn't as bad as some set ups I've seen, but 1.5GBs or higher will make a big difference in Vista's performance.<br>  <br>  Other than that, there's nothing that jumps out as an obvious cause for your problem.  Do you turn your computer off at night or do you leave it on all the time?  Leaving a PC on all the time can eventually tie up memory with unused data left over by programs you've run previously (not all clean up after themselves as they should).  When enough garbage is left in memory Windows can start to feel the pinch and slow down.<br>  <br>  Try shutting down (power off on the shut down menu, not standby or hibernate) and starting back up to see.  This clears everything out of RAM and frees up any previously unavailable resources.<br>  [/edit]|`|XncB2eIZaa	If your having problems with windows paging then that means you need more memory. If your running XP then 1gb-2gb should be enough. If its Vista then your going to need at least 2gb. Networking can't be the problem unless you have a crappy computer. Maybe you haven't ever defraged which on XP its <br>  Start> All Programs> Accessories> System tools>look for derfragmenter also run disk clean up which well be right by the defrag.<br>  <br>  On Vista open the windows logo where start is in XP and search to bar for the programs|`|TvxArTm1aa	If your page file is too small you can bump your page file up or just buy more RAM.

If it is then we can work from there, otherwise you may want to disconnect the XBox just to make sure. Hit CTRL+SHIFT+ESC and go to Processes. See what all is in there and make sure there is nothing running Memory outrageous. If there is something running on the 100,000k + write it down and comment on my post and we can see what's going on with it.<br>  <br>  If you have to increase the page file then I would only do it by a little at a time and you have to go to your computer properties > advanced > Performance Settings > Settings > Advanced > Change... <br>  <br>  There should be a tutorial online so google how to change the pagefile to something you need if you find that is a temp. fix to your problems then get more RAM.

(Advanced Step)<br>  You need a program called flash, convert the video using it and it will create a video window and all that (Choice of styles), then you publish it, this will make 4 files, it will make a video file in the form of an .flv file 2 swf's and a .html page. Open the .html page and copy the code between the tag <object> tag and the </object> tag (including the object tags). Copy this into the code view on front page then upload the files to the server as before. This is the proper way to upload videos.<br>  <br>  2. (Or, lazy step)<br>  Upload your video to either youtube or another video site, <a href="http://www.youtube.com," rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com,</a> or <a href="http://www.veoh.com," rel="nofollow">http://www.veoh.com,</a> then look for the embedding code and simply copy it and paste it into the code view window on front page.

zMj2ikmeaa	The previous two answers are excellent sources of information. I will add to those and say that it is easier to maneuver graphics in DTP than MSW because you are able to fine-tune the horizontal and vertical placement. Size can also be manipulated down to the .xxx decimal place in DTP where as in MSW, it's only .xx<br>  <br>  Secondly, if you have multiple pages of a document with graphics, it will wrap from one page to the next in MSW. In DTP, you can hold images in a blind (non-document) area and hold them for use later in the document.<br>  <br>  If you have DTP, USE IT. I switched from Word to DTP once i figured it out.|`|g62ATenqaa	As everything you insert into a DTP program is within frames, you have much more flexibility in the way you position and design your publication. You can utilise space more by using layers, overlapping boxes and so many more guides to help you align everything perfectly than there are available in a word processing package. Best advantage over a word processing package is you don't have to unwrap things. You put them where you want, nudge them gently into position and they stay put.<br>  <br>  Having said that though, there isn't much today that you can't do in Word that you can do in Publisher, only Publisher makes it faster, easier and less frustrating.|`|DCXk0bVLaa	Graphics can be inserted in a word processor but there is limited control over placement.<br>  A desktop publishing program allows for full control of each element.<br>  Blocks of text can be moved and re-sized and text effects can be applied.<br>  Graphics can also be more easily re-sized and placed.<br>  A DTP program allows far more control of the overall composition of the project.

r59SRbKIaa	1: WHY are you using an XHTML doctype? If you're only outputting vanilla html, not only does this incorrectly describe the document, it makes your validation different. Use a valid HTML doctype instead. This is RELEVANT in that CSS applies differently based on  a VALID doctype (quirks mode versus standards mode.)<br>  <br>  2. The language attribute is deprecated. Use<br>  <br>  <script type="text/javascript"><br>  <br>  3. Why inline styles? Kind of "locks you in" and hard-codes your styles in the programming, negating the whole idea of separating content from style and giving you a site-wide control over your pages. Do this:<br>  <br>  <br>  document.write("<table id="myTable" border='1'>")<br>  <br>  Then in your CSS you can do<br>  <br>  #myTable { width: 75%; margin:auto; }<br>  #myTable td { background: #f5f5f5; }<br>  #myTable td p { font-size: 85%; }<br>  <br>  Or classes, if multiple instances on a page:<br>  <br>  <br>  document.write("<table class="myTable" border='1'>")<br>  <br>  .myTable { width: 75%; margin:auto; }<br>  .myTable td { background: #f5f5f5; }<br>  .myTable td p { font-size: 85%; }<br>  <br>  With a single ID or class on the table, you can access all of the other elements in your table, no other inline hard-coding is required.
fE7zhp3Caa	You can't boost things without buying better speakers.  Most built-in speakers that come with LCD panels are tiny, underpowered little things that can't handle any kind of power.  If you push them too hard they'll pop.<br>  <br>  If you want big sound for games and/or movies, look into any of the 2.1 speaker sets (they're the ones with 2 satellites and a woofer).  Altec Lansing, Sony, Phillips, and Logitec all have 3-piece PC speaker sets starting at about $40 and going up.  Games and movies benefit from a separate woofer that can booom away under or beside your computer desk during explosions or climactic sequences.<br>  <br>  If you're planning on listening to lots of stereo music or working on some of your own, try looking for a good stereo set (without a separate woofer).  Stereo music doesn't benefit as much from a 3-piece speaker set, since you've only got one woofer doing bass for both channels.  This can give you the appearance of a hole in the frequency response of the speakers, a gap between the highest sound the woofer can reproduce and the lowest that the satellite pair can reproduce.  Do further reading on audio phase cancellation to find out why that hole shows up.<br>  <br>  Anyway, the music can end up sounding too bass and too treble at the same time, and there's nothing you can do to compensate because the speakers themselves are causing the problem.  That's why I'd strongly recommend a solid pair of speakers instead of a 3-piece.  I like Bose, but the cheapest pair that I've seen was about $100.  Altec Lansing has some decent pairs for around $30.  If you're working on music then expect to spend much more.  M-Audio, KRK, and Behringer all make high-quality mixing speakers, great monitors for a PC-based music studio.|`|d8685cdfce57268f3ec5dca715629f2caa	You just need some speakers. There are plenty suitable speakers nowadays for a low amount of money. <br>  <br>  My preferred are Altec Lansing 2.1 speakers. I am putting the link of the speakers that I have. You should not buy anything more than 2.1 speakers. they cost about 50 dollars if that is a good price for you. My speakers have lasted for like 5 years and still strong. Awesome mid and bass!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|C9AbiTDdaa	u cannot boost the sound ..what ever the capacity it has , it will provide.<br>  <br>  If still want to increase means, connect to external Speakers|`|esYTfoYraa	the Only option is external amplified Speakers

VgIBEANxaa	No.  Your laptop has a dedicated card, which is better than most laptops which only have integrated graphics (meaning it's just built into the motherboard), but there is still no standard way you can pull the dedicated card out and put a new one in.

WPT3C7MAaa	Yes it is possible. But it's not supposed to because Ethernet was not designed to work as such. If you setup as per your diagram, it will never work. <br>  <br>  The only way to make it work is to turn B into a sort of router. <br>  <br>  You have not mentioned what OS the computers are running, especially B. I'll assume your are running XP. <br>  <br>  First thing, you need to change your ip addressing scheme. You need to have 2 separate subnets. <br>  <br>  E.g A and B are 192.168.0.10/11<br>  and B and C are 192.168.2.12/14<br>  <br>  Now once you setup your IP addresses, you need to turn B into a router by binding the 2 NICs together. <br>  <br>  On B, <br>  - Open Network Connection and select the 2 NICs in the window. <br>  - Right Click and select BRIDGE Connections. <br>  <br>  If all goes well, all 3 computers will be connected by now. Just make sure you have all the configurations rite. Default gateways set on A and C properly. <br>  <br>  Btw, you can connect a 4th one with USB, firewire or a parallel cable, just use the same instructions. <br>  <br>  I just want to comment that although this setup will work, it will be painfully slow.

zorYTX59aa	The famous "WE'RE SORRY THIS VIDEO IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE" message <br>  is typically the result of software which stupidly claims that<br>  they can actually "accelerate" video buffering. This includes <br>  crappy things such as GWA, SpeedBit, Trident, Jaton, ATI, <br>  Diamond Fire and Easy Video Accelerator.<br>  <br>  Of course nothing "accelerates" streaming video files. Even<br>  the people at YouTube, Google and Macromedia know this, <br>  and write that in their own FAQs. Thus if you have any kind <br>  of "accelerator"...then dump it, burn it, kick it, rip it, trash it, <br>  uninstall it; do everything you can to get as far away from it <br>  as possible.<br>  <br>  If you do not have one of those moronic utilities, something <br>  on your computer is interfering with YouTube. Thus, please <br>  consider any of these possibilities:<br>  <br>  Not much in terms of playing YouTube vids has changed in<br>  the past 2 years. If anything, all the newer flash players are<br>  causing lots of YouTubers some kind of grief, especially all <br>  5 variations of version 10. It's crazy that there is a 10.0.525, <br>  10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54 and 10.12.36. For the most part, <br>  updates are typically good for one thing: computer/software <br>  problems. I have never strayed away from 9.47, and a lot of <br>  "flashers" swear by 9.45. Think of those 2 like Windows XP <br>  compared to Vista. Take a look at the "Asker's" comments <br>  to this other "Best Answer" of mine:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20081125075929AABZpVS">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  You may also wish to consider these alternate possibilities:<br>  <br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Connections (tab) <br>  → LAN Settings (which is the very last button)<br>  → uncheck "Automatically detect settings"<br>  <br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Advanced (tab)<br>  → scroll down until you reach "Multimedia"<br>  → check-mark all but "Show image download placeholders"<br>  <br>  Two people have written to me saying after they got rid of a <br>  certain software, things seemed to work all right afterwards:<br>  One person got rid of his "nVidia" drivers; the other trashed <br>  his "ad blocking" utility. Do you perhaps have either or both <br>  of these on your computer?<br>  <br>  I've saved my favorite other solution for the end. YouTube is<br>  at its best when you clear all your "Cookies", "History" and <br>  "Temporary Internet Files". My cool "CHTIF" triple-cure has <br>  resolved hundreds of people's problems, so why not yours?<br>  Close out YouTube, do the following, then shutdown/reboot:<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 6:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options <br>  → Delete Cookies → OK<br>  → Delete Files → OK<br>  → Clear History → Yes <br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 7:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Delete...<br>  → Delete files → Yes<br>  → Delete cookies → OK<br>  → Delete history → OK<br>  → Close (browsing history window)<br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Mozilla Firefox<br>  → Tools → Clear Private Data<br>  [x] Browsing History<br>  [x] Download History<br>  [x] Saved Form and Search History<br>  [x] Cache<br>  [x] Cookies<br>  → Clear Private Data Now<br>  <br>  I hope my multiple answer is helpful for you. If you are able<br>  to determine the "cause" and its "cure", I would appreciate<br>  it if you could please let me know, either by clicking on my <br>  avatar or emailing me at "inukjuak90@yahoo.com".<br>  <br>  IMPORTANT: ANOTHER POSSIBLE CAUSE IS FIREFOX 3 AND ITS <br>  INTERACTION WITH YOUTUBE'S (GOOGLE'S) "CACHE" SERVERS<br>  THAT REFUSE THE PLUG-IN'S REQUEST FOR VIDEO FILES. THIS <br>  RETURNS A FALSE ERROR CODE TO YOUTUBE SAYING THAT IT <br>  CAN'T FIND THE VIDEO, OR THAT THE REQUEST DOESN'T MAKE <br>  SENSE.<br>  <br>  OF COURSE, THE VIDEOS ARE REALLY THERE, BUT FOR SOME <br>  STRANGE REASON, YOUTUBE RETRANSMITS THE ERRONEOUS <br>  CODE TO A "THIS VIDEO IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE" MESSAGE.<br>  WHAT'S THE SOLUTION? NOBODY KNOWS, BUT IT IS A FIREFOX<br>  AND YOUTUBE ISSUE.

If you are discovered using the school/company computers for restricted sites, you will endure severe consequences. It's honestly not worth the tough repercussions involved.<br>  There are plenty of sites your computer will allow that are far better than that, and worth your time. Attempting to dodge security software processors will land you in sharp consequences.<br>  They are blocked for several reasons, and there is no changing that. With the multitude of computer viruses spreading around, companies cannot take any chances.<br>  Bypassing the filters set-up by companies is near impossible.

One program that you can try is Advanced Systemcare3 which is a free program that will do numerous things to your computer that a novice would find difficult to do. It will optimise your system, defrag if necessary, get rid of spyware, optimise RAM, clean registry, delete temp files etc. plus a lot more. If this does not work you may need to look further. Anti virus can make your computer run very slowly. Spyware is another culprit. You can run malwarebytes antimalware that is a good program for getting rid of adware/spyware. You can also run several registry cleaners like JV16 powertools, Glarysoft Reg Cleaner, CCleaner. It is also very useful to get rid of programs on the HD that you do not use and stop any programs that you do not need on the start up menu. Updating all your drivers can also speed up performance. Lastly and probably most importantly increasing the amount of RAM you have in the machine can significantly increase computer speed. Hope this helps.

MtW5KVWvaa	2 things factor in to how much your RAM your system can run.<br>  <br>  1st is your motherboard , I would advise going to <a href="http://www.crucial.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.crucial.com/</a> and run the system scanner tool. That will tell you how much and how fast of ram your motherboard can support.<br>  <br>  2nd , it depends on what Operating System you use. (I recommend at LEAST 1 gig for XP or 2 gig for Vista). <br>  Windows XP 32bit (all) = 4gig max<br>  Windows Vista 32bit (all) = 4 gig max<br>  Windows XP Prof. 64bit = 128gig max<br>  Windows Vista 64bit Home basic = 8gig max<br>  Windows Vista 64bit Home Prem. = 16gig max<br>  Windows Vista 64bit Business = 128gig max<br>  Windows Vista 64bit Enterprise = 128gig max<br>  Windows Vista 64bit Ultimate = 128gig max<br>  <br>  Just keep in mind that just because your Operating system might support say 8 gigs of ram, if your motherboard cant support it then its useless.

z46THMt8aa	As someone who was in the computer hardware business for years (though I rarely sold printers since I couldn't compete with the crazy rebates) I have always recommended Epson. The print quality is excellent, even on plain paper. I have photos I printed on a 640 about ten years ago hanging in my office which still look good, though not as good as the ones from the CX8400 on glossy paper. The warranty is excellent. For a year, Epson will express-ship a replacement and pick up the old one. I had one customer who needed this. He called one afternoon and had the replacement two days later. Another client bought a Canon. It needed two repairs within a few months. Each time it was taken to the repair center, then picked up a few days later. This client runs a specialty printing business and this really hurt. They have since bought an Epson and have had no down time since.<br>  <br>  Epson has also made things easier for their customers by standardizing their cartridges. Most of their printers use one of two types. The three-color plus black use T069 (CX5000 CX6000 CX7000 CX7400 CX7450 CX8400 CX9400FAX CX9475Fax NX100 NX105 NX400 Workforce 30/40/500/600 and C120) and the 5-color plus black use T078 (R260 R280 R380 RX580 RX595 and RX680). This means you should be able to find a lot of people who use the same cartridges you do and possibly buy in quantity. When it's time to replace the printer, the next model will probably also use the same ones. <br>  <br>  Though I am quite happy with the results of the CX8400, if you really want the absolute best photo quality, go with one of the 5-color ones. Some of the models above include scanner and/or printing on DVDs.<br>  <br>  The biggest complaint about all inkjets is the high cost of ink cartridges. <a href="http://ccs-digital.com" rel="nofollow">http://ccs-digital.com</a> has cartridges for about $4.50 each. They also have a unique product - a two-piece cartridge where the ink is in a separate tank inside the cartridge. When the ink runs out, you replace just the ink tank and the original chip resets itself to full.  By keeping the same chip, you save 1.50 per cartridge. Ink tanks are only $3 and hold 50% more ink than disposable cartridges.

e2HW9iQ5aa	Servers. More specifically probably rack mount servers.|`|yf8qSFCNaa	A backplane (or "backplane system") is a circuit board (usually a printed circuit board) that connects several connectors in parallel to each other, so that each pin of each connector is linked to the same relative pin of all the other connectors[1], forming a computer bus. It is used as a backbone to connect several printed circuit boards together to make up a complete computer system. Early personal computers like the Apple II and the IBM PC integrated an internal backplane for expansion cards.<br>  Backplanes have grown in complexity from the simple ISA (used in the original IBM PC) or S-100 style where all the connectors were connected to a common bus. Because of limitations inherent in the PCI specification for driving slots, backplanes are now offered as passive and active.

The addons are things that improve the functionality of the user interface, such as changing the look of the HP bars, etc. Quest Trackers such as questhelper are VERY popular and also completely legal. <br>  <br>  The only stipulation here is that these addons are not supported by WoW. This means that if you have issues with them, you can't go to WoW for support in fixing the issues. However, they ARE legal and you won't find yourself banned for using them. <br>  <br>  If the addons you are talking about do something like "automate your character so you can level without being at the computer" then yes, you'll get banned. <br>  <br>  However, I wouldn't be too concerned about using the ones your friend sent you. There is nothing against using tools that improve the game's functionality. If you browse around the CURSE website, you'll see what I mean.<br>  <br>  *edit* I also think you're a little bit confused about what you've been given. As is well stated previously, WinRAR is nothing more than a program like winzip that compacts files. While the contents may be illegal, the program itself is not. However, as I have mentioned previously, I recommend you go to the Curse website and look at some addons that have been created.

dkpIjt5jaa	Virtual memory, also called page file or swap file, is a file on your hard drive (C:\pagefile.sys by default) that Windows and applications use in addition to physical memory (RAM) as needed. <br>  <br>  The rule of thumbs for the size of this file is 1.5 times the amount of physical memory, it is also recommended to make the minimum and maximum size the same to avoid serious fragmentation.<br>  <br>  Here are a few examples: 512 MB RAM = 768 MB Page File - 1 GB (1024 MB) RAM = 1.5 GB (1536 MB) Page File - 2 GB (2048 MB) RAM = 3 GB (3072 MB) Page File and so on.<br>  <br>  Getting your paging file into shape is a simple operation, if you're confident delving into submenus and manually making adjustments. <br>  <br>  Vista users: From the Start menu, hit the Computer button on the right, and then right-click on your C drive and choose System. From there, click on Advanced System Settings and under the Advanced tab, choose Performance Settings. Choose the Advanced tab in the window that opens and Change Virtual Memory. Vista users should keep the Initial Size and Maximum Size the same, but no less than one and a half times the amount of RAM you've got.<br>  <br>  ( Don't worry about making all those operations, as long as you take your time (go slowly) and follow the steps one by one in order, everything will be fine (I know because I've done that a hundred times and I wasn't an expert the first time) )|`|3LHsCLVFaa	It is best to let windows manage the swap file. However if you elect to do it yourself set the max to 2.5 time the amount of installed ram. The min to the same as installed ram. Even then it may still complain.

However you need to take care because the download speed for example does not just depend on you router but your wireless card.

However, there is no option or way to reset or restore the file type or file extension association to back to original default the is configured in factory-pre-installed or freshly installed Windows Vista.<br>  <br>  List of programs available under “Set Default Programs” link, such as Internet Explorer, Microsoft Office Outlook, Windows Calender, Windows Mail, Windows Media Player and Windows Photo Gallery has defined their own default supported file extensions, types and protocols. And, user can easily set the program as the default program to use to open all file types and protocols it can open. Even so, it may not be the default file association that configured in Windows Vista originally.<br>  <br>  Unless user remembers and knows the original file association and change the default program for the kind of file type accordingly using the graphical user interface (GUI) in Control Panel, else here’s another workaround to restore and reset the file association to the default Windows Vista version of file association.<br>  Click Start Menu, and then type regedit in the Start Search and press ENTER.<br>  Navigate to the following registry branch: <br>  <br>  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\W... ntVersion\Explorer\FileExts\[ext]<br>  <br>  Replace the [exe] with the actual file extension that you want to restore its file type association to revert back to original Windows Vista default. If you unsure, simply browse through all the sub-key under FileExts.<br>  Delete the sub-key named UserChoice.<br>  Exit from Registry Editor.<br>  <br>  Windows Vista will now use original file associations that comes built into system for the particular file extensions with “UserChoice” deleted. However, the trick is not foolproof, especially if the other related system registry keys for the particular extension have been corrupted or broken. In such cases, it may be necessary to fix the file association by restoring its registry settings.|`|zNw5WBSKaa	Try re installing winrar, and reboot your system, that should do the trick.

With your purchase of Norton 360 you are given 2 GB of storage space for backed up files.

2SSA9e9Naa	An array by definition is a single entry per unit. So a character array CAN be 20 single characters. It all depends on how you populate it.<br>  <br>  If you use a string command like strcpy it will then treat the array as a string and put a \0 in the entry after the last character. In that case the max string is 19 characters long.<br>  <br>  If you put a 20 character string into the array using strcpy, it will put a \0 at the 21st position which will cause an out of bounds error.|`|9GmoO5NLaa	It can hold 20 and a null terminator|`|dOMzkQIraa	Strings and arrays are treated differently in C++<br>  <br>  A 20 character array can hold 20 characters.|`|LAGtBzWuaa	Project Code-<a href="http://codeprojects.info" rel="nofollow">http://codeprojects.info</a>

If you are discovered using the school/company computers for restricted sites, you will endure severe consequences. It's honestly not worth the tough repercussions involved.<br>  There are plenty of sites your computer will allow that are far better than that, and worth your time. Attempting to dodge security software processors will land you in sharp consequences.<br>  They are blocked for several reasons, and there is no changing that. With the multitude of computer viruses spreading around, companies cannot take any chances.<br>  Bypassing the filters set-up by companies is near impossible. The major Web security gateway software processors are pretty well impenetrable.|`|oZydD2rsaa	Here's a free proxy created today:<br>   <br>  <a href="http://mcancer1.com/2/" rel="nofollow">http://mcancer1.com/2/</a><br>  <br>  -Unblock ANY Website<br>  -watch youtube videos<br>  -download up to 100 MB<br>  -hide you IP and stay anonymous<br>  -Fast and hosted on a dedicated server<br>  <br>  I get new proxies here everyday:<br>  <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Coolproxies">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Coolproxie...</a> <br>  <br>  <br>  Email me if it's not working and i'll email you a proxy that I haven't advertised yet|`|9n53vXGKaa	The Most Working PROXY 100% and easily to be Used <br>  <br>  Unblock all web around you <br>  <br>  here it is some WebSites You can use ::<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.247Web.co.cc" rel="nofollow">http://www.247Web.co.cc</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hidden-surf.co.cc" rel="nofollow">http://www.hidden-surf.co.cc</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.xunblocker.co.cc" rel="nofollow">http://www.xunblocker.co.cc</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.2surfall.co.cc" rel="nofollow">http://www.2surfall.co.cc</a><br>  <br>  Be Sure to tell your friends or post them to your myspace page or blog so others can enjoy.<br>  <br>  Happy Surfing!|`|AA10953648	use <br>  <br>  jokerisalive[dot]com<br>  catonmat[dot]info<br>  yahoothis[dot]info<br>  yahoothat[dot]info<br>  <br>  <br>  please replace [dot] with a "." and use <br>  yahoo answers isn't allowing me to post direct urls<br>  <br>  <br>  get a $50 McDonald giftcard from here <a href="http://login.tracking101.com/ez/bslgsvfkvlsd/&subid1=group" rel="nofollow">http://login.tracking101.com/ez/bslgsvfk...</a>|`|RX2Teadvaa	Try ultra surf.

ZtZm4qfxaa	congratulations by the way. I think your baby is a girl. I know it sounds stupid but my brother and two of my sisters have had babies and i got it right all three times at about the same time.<br>  <br>  it is a little early though<br>  <br>  Notes: Just some facts<br>  <br>  At 12 weeks after conception the foetus is fully formed. It has all its organs, muscles, limbs, bones as well as well developed sex organs all that is left to do now is grow and mature.<br>  Female sex organs develop very quickly and i would say that the uterine tubes aka fallopian tubes are most prominent.<br>  <br>  After 14 weeks a heartbeat can be heard via ultrasound, however, it's about double the speed of an average adult. A bump may begin to show although it varies from women to women. Your baby will be 85mm long by 14 weeks.<br>  I base my opinion mainly but not entirely on image 3<br>  <br>  Once again congratulations on you baby girl<br>  <br>  p.s - sorry for refering to your baby as 'it' and 'it's' not too sure what else to say!|`|3qLIRorjaa	Well it's either going to be a boy or a girl....|`|ZvxyqG3Paa	its   a    boy  .|`|hNCiw6Laaa	Not a clue?? but isn't technology fantastic that not only can you be scanned in such away but to be able to send everyone in the world the actual scanning !!

Don't Do Me Any Favors<br>  There's a setting buried in Windows XP that tells your computer to restart when a system error occurs. you turn off that option, you may solve your automatic reboot problem. <br>  1) Click Start, then open Control Panel<br>  2) Click Performance and Maintenance<br>  3) Click System <br>  4) Click on the Advanced Tab<br>  5) Click Settings in the Startup and Recovery section<br>  6) Uncheck Automatically Restart in the System failure section <br>  Note that this may prevent the system from restarting, but it can also mask the true problem.<br>  The most common cause of computer restarting is a corrupt registry. <br>  Most likely your registry is bloated and overstuffed with an assortment of useless pieces of data. The operating system while running your computer has to pick its way through all this excess material. There will be bits of programs which were not completely uninstalled, parts of programs which were never completely installed, fragments of miscellaneous data, useless drivers, and a multitude of other bits and pieces.<br>  The answer is to clean your registry and remove all the material which is not needed.<br>  <a href="http://toptenantispyware.com/Clean_Up_Center.htm" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispyware.com/Clean_Up_Ce...</a><br>  Get the best one, and completely clean your windows registry with a few clicks of the mouse.<br>  <br>  III.

WhlwZeiXaa	leave your roommates laptop alone|`|4zO1Yvjsaa	Aren't you on it right now?|`|AicQ9LdEaa	If you have your computer's Windows XP disk you can use the following method:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>      1. Place your Windows XP CD in your cd-rom and start your computer (it’s assumed here that your XP CD is bootable – as it should be - and that you have your bios set to boot from CD)<br>  <br>      2. Keep your eye on the screen messages for booting to your cd Typically, it will be “Press any key to boot from cd”<br>  <br>      3. Once you get in, the first screen will indicate that Setup is inspecting your system and loading files.<br>  <br>      4. When you get to the Welcome to Setup screen, press ENTER to Setup Windows now<br>  <br>      5. The Licensing Agreement comes next - Press F8 to accept it.<br>  <br>      6. The next screen is the Setup screen which gives you the option to do a Repair.<br>  <br>      It should read something like “If one of the following Windows XP installations is damaged, Setup can try to repair it”<br>  <br>      Use the up and down arrow keys to select your XP installation (if you only have one, it should already be selected) and press R to begin the Repair process.<br>  <br>      7. Let the Repair run. Setup will now check your disks and then start copying files which can take several minutes.<br>  <br>      8. Shortly after the Copying Files stage, you will be required to reboot. (this will happen automatically – you will see a progress bar stating “Your computer will reboot in 15 seconds”<br>  <br>      9. During the reboot, do not make the mistake of “pressing any key” to boot from the CD again! Setup will resume automatically with the standard billboard screens and you will notice Installing Windows is highlighted.<br>  <br>      10. Keep your eye on the lower left hand side of the screen and when you see the Installing Devices progress bar, press SHIFT + F10. This is the security hole! A command console will now open up giving you the potential for wide access to your system.<br>  <br>      11. At the prompt, type NUSRMGR.CPL and press Enter. Voila! You have just gained graphical access to your User Accounts in the Control Panel.<br>  <br>      12. Now simply pick the account you need to change and remove or change your password as you prefer. If you want to log on without having to enter your new password, you can type control userpasswords2 at the prompt and choose to log on without being asked for password. After you’ve made your changes close the windows, exit the command box and continue on with the Repair (have your Product key handy).<br>  <br>      13. Once the Repair is done, you will be able to log on with your new password (or without a password if you chose not to use one or if you chose not to be asked for a password). Your programs and personalized settings should remain intact.<br>  <br>  I tested the above on Windows XP Pro with and without SP1 and also used this method in a real situation where someone could not remember their password and it worked like a charm to fix the problem. This security hole allows access to more than just user accounts. You can also access the Registry and Policy Editor, for example. And its gui access with mouse control. Of course, a Product Key will be needed to continue with the Repair after making the changes, but for anyone intent on gaining access to your system, this would be no problem.<br>  <br>  And in case you are wondering, NO, you cannot cancel install after making the changes and expect to logon with your new password.<br>  <br>  Cancelling will just result in Setup resuming at bootup and your changes will be lost.<br>  <br>  Ok, now that your logon problem is fixed, you should make a point to prevent it from ever happening again by creating a Password Reset Disk. This is a floppy disk you can use in the event you ever forget your log on password. It allows you to set a new password.<br>  <br>  Here's how to create one if your computer is NOT on a domain:<br>  <br>      * Go to the Control Panel and open up User Accounts.<br>      * Choose your account (under Pick An Account to Change) and under Related Tasks, click "Prevent a forgotten password".<br>      * This will initiate a wizard.<br>      * Click Next and then insert a blank formatted floppy disk into your A: drive.<br>      * Click Next and enter your logon password in the password box.<br>      * Click Next to begin the creation of your Password disk.<br>      * Once completed, label and save the disk to a safe place<br>  <br>  How to Log on to your PC Using Your Password Reset Disk<br>  <br>  Start your computer and at the logon screen, click your user name and leave the password box blank or just type in anything. This will bring up a Logon Failure box and you will then see the option to use your Password Reset disk to create a new password. Click it which will initiate the Password Reset wizard. Insert your password reset disk into your floppy drive and follow the wizard which will let you choose a new password to use for your account.<br>  <br>  Note: If your computer is part of a domain, the procedure for creating a password disk is different.<br>  <br>  See here for step by step instructions: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=KB;en-us;306214&" rel="nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/default.asp...</a>|`|1cSaoJAtaa	lawl<br>  <br>  download and burn this iso: <a href="http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4615397/Hirens_BootCD_9.7_with_keyboardpatch" rel="nofollow">http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/4615397/...</a><br>  <br>  Boot it and check out the password recovery options.<br>  Several programs in there to wipe passwords from any account.<br>  <br>  Peace
7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	Almost all Linux distributions run from CD, and have installers to install to your hard drive - which is good.  You can try a distro before you install it and, if you don't like it, burn another CD.  (If you use a CD-RW, you can burn a lot of different distros on one CD.  Burn one, try it, if you don't like it, burn another, etc.)<br>  <br>  Puppy is small.  If you want a larger distro (Linux is the same, it's the extra programs that differ from distro to distro), Ubuntu is about the most popular.<br>  <br>  DON'T install Linux in place of Windows.  Make a separate partition (or use a separate disk drive - storage is cheap these days) and install a dual-boot, even after you find the distro you like.  There are still a few things you might need Windows for (some games, mostly) or you might just decide to use Windows.  Windows and Linux can both live on the same computer - even though you can only run one of them at a time.|`|dfjIBHe3aa	Um.  You are giving us all the WRONG reasons to install Linux on your PC.

If you want to get serious about it...<br>  <br>  the easiest and most adaptable of the distros is slax, which is based on slackware, the oldest continuously maintained distro (and the one which I am writing this on).<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.slax.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.slax.org</a><br>  <br>  It defaults to the command line with instructions as to how to start up the desktop.Once you gave the desktop going you can install anything into the system.

You can boot it up to the command line by typing knoppix text at the boot prompt.  Again, you don't have to worry about installing it (it installs as debian anyhow).  You can become root with su, or by opening a root window.  Interestingly, if you are ever prompted for a password just hit enter.  There are no passwords for either user knoppix or user root.<br>  <br>  Damn Small Linux is another possibility:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://distro.ibiblio.org/pub/linux/distributions/damnsmall/current/current.iso" rel="nofollow">http://distro.ibiblio.org/pub/linux/dist...</a><br>  <br>  DSL as we call it affectionately is a stunt -- a complete OS based which takes only 80MB of CD space.<br>  <br>  Finally there id dyne:bolic<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dynebolic.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.dynebolic.org</a><br>  <br>  It was frankly fooling with that which got me to reinstall Slackware on this after I realized how much under the hood it was slackware.

This will tell you exactly which Linux Distro is best for you.  I would look at the following distros:<br>  Ubuntu: The most popular disto with the largest number of packages (based off of Debian GNU/Linux a development oriented Linux distro)<br>  Fedora: The second most popular distro with a more business orientation to it (based off of Red Hat Linux, the first business oriented Linux distro)<br>  SUSE: Novel's Linux distro, it has good multimedia support<br>  Mandriva: A great distro with a good support community<br>  Linux Mint: This is Ubuntu that has been made even more user friendly<br>  Lindros: The most "Windows" like of all the Linux distros (based off of Debian GNU/Linux)<br>  Puppy Linux: a small Linux distro that is great for older hardware<br>  DSL: an even smaller Linux distro (ie one floppy disk)<br>  Xubuntu: A smaller version of Ubuntu meant for older hardware (I used this on an old laptop that was designed for Win 95)<br>  <br>  There are literally millions of other distros out there and you can find them all at Linux.org .  Each distro of Linux will have a terminal which you can practise using.  With the exception of maybe SUSE (has a LiveDVD), all the distros run quite effectively off of a single CD and take not much more then 5GB of your HD space if you install it on your computer.

sCAvtfpXaa	- malloc is the fastest of the 3 dynamic memory allocation functions.<br>  - realloc can be just as fast as malloc, if the size allocated is less than or the same size as was currently allocated. However, if it is larger, then the memory is allocated and the information that was in the previous memory location is copied over to the new memory location for you before it returns the new pointer location.<br>  - calloc is essentially a malloc and a call to memset() to force the allocated memory to a zero (which is great for allocating char * variables.<br>  <br>  You never want to call malloc/calloc several times without deallocating the memory between the calls to malloc()/calloc(). The reason for this is because the program will just be eating up memory and never making it available for future use, that is until the program ends.<br>  This is one of the typical "first time" programmer's mistakes. They will code something like this:<br>  int main()<br>  {<br>  ???int i = 0;<br>  ???while (i < 400)<br>  ???{<br>  ??????char *mystr = calloc(1, sizeof(char));<br>  ??????getline(mystr);<br>  ??????...<br>  ??????/* do other things here */<br>  ??????...<br>  ???}<br>  ???return 0;<br>  }<br>  <br>  Instead of adding the'free()' function call to return memory to the memory heap, as it should be done.<br>  <br>  int main()<br>  {<br>  ???int i = 0;<br>  ???while (i < 400)<br>  ???{<br>  ??????char *mystr = calloc(5000, sizeof(char));<br>  ??????getline(mystr);<br>  ??????...<br>  ??????/* do other things here */<br>  ??????...<br>  <br>  ??????/*******************************...<br>  ??????Don't forget to deallocate ??????the memory!<br>  ??????********************************...<br>  ??????free(mystr);<br>  <br>  ???}<br>  ???return 0;<br>  }<br>  <br>  <br>  Of course, there's also the other option of using realloc that way you don't take up unnecessary heap allocation/deallocation very often, which can be a time critical task.<br>  <br>  int main()<br>  {<br>  ???int i = 0;<br>  ???char *mystr = NULL;<br>  ???while (i < 400)<br>  ???{<br>  ??????mystr = realloc(mystr, 5000 * sizeof(char));<br>  ??????getline(mystr);<br>  ??????...<br>  ??????/* do other things here */<br>  ??????...<br>  <br>  ??????/*******************************...<br>  ??????Don't forget to deallocate ??????the memory!<br>  ??????********************************...<br>  <br>  ???}<br>  ???free(mystr);<br>  ???return 0;<br>  }<br>  <br>  ETA: For systems where items are time critical, it is often (though not always) suggested to not use dynamic memory allocation.|`|WxYHU9Z9aa	calloc is used to allocate memory dynamically and also initialize value with zero.<br>  <br>  malloc is used to allocate memory dynamically with no initialize still we use it because it is faster than calloc.<br>  <br>  realloc is used to increase the memory allocated previously.|`|oNJPw4P5aa	Read this in wiki<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malloc" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malloc</a><br>  I would help you if it were c++ with new but I dont know c|`|YfsqXG3naa	providing some ram that the program needs to perform data processing while running

This has some attribute (e.g. an index number) which means it can be sorted and compared to other widgets. This should implement the Comparable interface which is the mechanism of comparison.<br>  <br>  You will have an array of widgets, which should start off by being sorted.  There is a sort() method in Java.util.Arrays, which will make use of the comparison mechanism.<br>  <br>  You want to be able to throw a widget at this list, and find out if this already exists in the list by using the comparison.<br>  <br>  That's it!<br>  <br>  Ok, when you have got the design right, then you can start coding it.

You'll need to do this so that widgetA can be compared to widgetB, and return 1, 0 or -1 depending whether it's higer equal or lower order.<br>  <br>  When you've sussed the widget, you just need to write code to create a bunch of them, and place them in an array.  After that, sort the array.<br>  <br>  Then you'll need the code to see if any one widget is in the array.<br>  <br>  Finally you need code to choose the widget you want to try it out on.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!

A ticking noise means the reading arm is damaged, if it's a continuous sound like you're describing then the reading arm is probably lying down on the Discs and scratching them. In most cases if it scratches one disc, then the rest are scratched and damaged as well. I would not recommend repairing it because that can potentially cost you, and once hardware is broken, it's likely to fail again. I would just replace the HDD and reinstall your O/S. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!

Obviously, friends and/or family have told you that your music doesn't begin to play automatically for them and you figured out they have popup blocking on. They can add your site to the exclusions in their popup. In IE simply click on Tools--Internet Options--Privacy, then under Pop-up Blocker click on Settings. In the dialog box under, "Address of website to allow" enter your address then click Add. From then on out anytime they browse to your website your music will play automatically. <br>  <br>  In Firefox you do a similar process. Click on Tools--Options--Privacy, then under Pop-up Blocker click on Exceptions and enter your website address and click Add. <br>  <br>  If you wish to allow anyone, even strangers who browse to your website as you describe here you will need to access the Help or Support of the embedded player you use on your website and get the information there on how to stop automatic play and allow visitors to click on your music when or if they wish to hear it. If you are unsure how to proceed even with the Help instructions there should be a User or Community Forum for the player. Go to it and ask there for help. Good luck and have a nice day.

Probably the .jpeg format didn't exist back then, or, it was just too complicated for most PCs of that era.<br>  <br>  The .BMP format is easy to program, but it's also stupid in many ways. The image is stored upside-down by default, and many old Windows 3.1 apps reject the RLE compressed ones.<br>  <br>  Most old DOS programs use the .PCX format, which are similar to .BMP, using RLE compression.<br>  <br>  Be sure to "read" the VGA screen with BGI calls.

quZRbU5yaa	Chances are your default CD burning speed is set too low for the rewritable CD that you put in your drive. Open your CD burning program, (or Windows, if that's what you're using), and change the default burning speed to 32x. That is the usual default on many CDs, however, you may want to choose the highest option available if 32x doesn't work. <br>  <br>  As for only burning 4 songs onto a CD, if the files are in .cda format, and approximately 7-8 minutes each, then that sounds about normal.<br>  <br>  However, if you're burning .mp3 files, you should be able to fit quite a few (100+ songs) on a 700MB CD (which is standard). <br>  <br>  Finally, if you can't seem to burn what you want onto the CD, try buying new CDs from a decent brand name like Memorex or Sony. Your current CD-R's may be bad. <br>  <br>  Good luck.

FGtQPiUiaa	Assuming it's a global variable, it doesn't matter where you declare it.  Declaring it at the end is just a style consideration.  <br>  <br>  If it's declared at the end of a routine and never used, it's pointless.  Any good compiler will optimize it out.|`|SwCKOP6xaa	please provide more detail.|`|7bb0efb37d1d3c0228ce2e788f4e2555aa	My guess is that it's probably an object, and it's invoking its constructor.|`|rl530Za9aa	Variables are commands that programmers add to software to change options at the very core of the program or to define parameters on how the program runs. These variables are independent to the software itself on what variables you can use, if any.<br>  <br>    As an example, there is an internal application in Windows XP called sfc.exe. This program is called "System File Checker" in which it scans your computer for system files that are changed or corrupted and can fix them. To run this application, you would have to go to a command prompt and type "sfc" followed by a few variables. Without variables, this program will do nothing once executed except show you what variable options you can choose. In the case of this program, we need to type "sfc /scannow" for the program to do its job.<br>  <br>    You can also define variables in shortcuts by adding the variable at the end of the shortcut executable in the properties. This will run that program as well as the specified variable every time you use the shortcut.<br>  <br>    Hope this helps.|`|zlCTStzraa	I can't think of any good reason to do so. In the languages that I'm aware of (besides PHP), you can't use a variable until you declare it. So, if the variable is at the very end of a program, that would mean that it's never used. It would just waste memory. In all likelihood, the compiler would ignore it completely.

SLI and Crossfire require more power, generate more heat and don't always scale well.<br>  <br>  SLI gains are usually a lot better than 10% though.|`|TnPiiwoAaa	I would rather get a very high end card and install it on its own, simply because SLI delivers not even a 10% performance gain, and sometimes as little as a few frames per second more. For the cash outlay it isn't worth it.<br>  <br>  (in my experience)

RoMxIa1Jaa	Depends on how much RAM you have, but if you have 1GB or more, it should be plenty.<br>  <br>  I'll elaborate a little here... The only programs which *should* be using resources on your machine are the AVG and Zone Alarm; but that isn't the case.<br>  Being an on-demand scanner (no *real-time* protection), Ad-Aware *shouldn't* use any resources unless you are updating or running it; but it does. <br>  It insists on running at Windows start-up (no need for it to do that), but if you disable it from doing that, it won't update! <br>  <br>  And besides that, Ad-Aware is a pretty lame excuse of an antimalware program. All I've ever known it to find are cookies and MRUs.<br>  <br>  For these reasons, I strongly suggest that you dump the Ad-Aware and replace it with the free version of either Superantispyware or Malwarebytes Anti-Malware (or both). They only use resources when you are running or updating them.<br>  <br>  > Superantispyware: <a href="http://www.superantispyware.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.superantispyware.com</a><br>  > Malwarebytes Anti-Malware: <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</a><br>  <br>  If you download, update, and run a full system scan with Super or MBAM, there's a pretty good chance that one of them will find some type of malware that is contributing to your machine running slow.<br>  <br>  Another thing to consider is to download and run CCleaner.<br>  Just run it on its default settings, and be sure to let it make a back up of what it removes. You'll probably be amazed how much crap it finds and removes.<br>  > CCleaner:  *<br>  <br>  One last thing I suggest is to use the SD Helper function of Spybot. That is your immunization. But I don't run the Spybot Tea Timer, because it is much more of a nuisance than it is worth ;-)<br>  <br>  * Yahoo is error-999 ing the CCleaner link, so here is an alternate link:<br>  <a href="http://majorgeeks.com/download4191.html" rel="nofollow">http://majorgeeks.com/download4191.html</a>

It would be on the back of your computer (identify that please) which looks like an extra-wide phone jack.  You connect that to your DSL modem (if you are DSL) by cable.  If you don't have that port, you may be able to connect via one of your USB ports.  If you have neither, a simple add-on card (w/either or both USB and ethernet connection) should be available at your retaler.  It's a snap to add on cards - make sure you have a free slot.  I find it hard to believe that you have nothing but 1394.<br>  <br>  If you have that ethernet port, connect that to your modem - the computer should detect the DSL modem and make a LAN connection automatically.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, please repost this question with a summary of those details.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	Assuming that you DO have an Ethernet card, you have to install the driver for it.

Without a driver, hardware (like the Ethernet card) is invisible to Windows.  (It has to be the XP driver - XP can't use Vista drivers and Vista can't use XP drivers.)<br>  <br>  DON'T install the Telus software - once the Ethernet driver is installed you should be able to connect to your router or modem with no problem.|`|VTtOx27maa	Well looks like your computer doesnt have proper device drivers for your<br>  Network card.To fix that you have to install the proper device driver from<br>  the Drivers CD came with your computer(If it s on board card)\or network card.if you dont have those CD You have to get those drivers from Manufacture's web site.To do so you gonna need the model number of your network card.to get it just right click on my computer icon>properties>Hardware>Device manager.in that you window you can find your network card model number under the network adapters sub menu.(usually there will a yellow question mark  besides your network card model number)|`|7j9Hj02caa	dude you need an ethernet cable.

xe1NoWUNaa	Simple Answer' Norton is a over bloated piece of crap. I've used it' Never again. Don't try the free AV's. They will let you down. AVG' free has no real time protection. It will only detect after it is on your hard drive and then it will not remove the infection. At most it will lock it up on your hard drive in a vault. When you delete AVG it will turn the virus back loose on your hard drive. AVAST isn't much better. It's detection rate is pretty low 84% and a 76% protection rate. It is said to have real time protection. When i used it i got one of the worst HUPIGON infections it ever had and it never detected it.Trend micro' It's not even worth talking about.

It will be fine and nothing will be on the RAM memory when you give it to your friend.|`|DWU0iCbVaa	Main memory(RAM) holds all of the instructions and data that are currently being used by the computer, everything is run from Main memory, there are various Virtual paging setups that allow your  HDD to be an extension of your Main Memory, but in the end the CPU fetches its instructions and data from main memory, unless what it needs is stored in the cache. RAM is volatile, which means that when the power is turned off all the information stored in it is gone, that is where HDD comes into play, HDD is persistent and will retain data even when there is no power. The reason for the Memory Hierarchy is that there is a significant speed increase from Main Memory and Secondary memory, however also associated with that is a higher cost per bit. So if you get rid of your RAM completely then you computer will not run, and if you keep a small portion of it your computer will run poorly due to the constant swapping of data and instructions from your Main Memory and HDD.|`|4dfbcf738541ddcd8d3291d2dbbb44deaa	The RAMM only holds data while the computer is on.And it's easy to find.The cards plug right into the mother board.Shaped like a very large stick of gum.There should be white clamps holding it in.To use the memory you have to be 100% sure it's compatible with the mother board you plug it into.|`|XMeOpfS0aa	RAM<br>  <br>  R - random<br>  <br>  A - access<br>  <br>  M - memory<br>  <br>  Data is stored on the ram when the comupter is running e.g. programs your using.

If it works with one drive connected but not the other, you've got one bad floppy drive.<br>  <br>  If the error is still present with either drive connected try replacing the floppy cable with a known-good one and repeat the process.  If it still doesn't work, you may have a bad floppy controller (either on the motherboard or I/O controller card depending on how old the system is) or both drives are shot.  Connect a known-good floppy drive to your system using a known-good cable to test its floppy controller.  If you still have problems then your floppy controller is flaking out.  You can install a PCI FDD controller or replace your I/O controller card (ISA) to correct the problem.<br>  <br>  You should also test the floppy drives in another PC if possible, one that isn't having any problems with its own floppy drive controller.<br>  <br>  The IDE message isn't an error exactly.  It's more of a notification.  ATA 66 and higher use 80 conductor cables instead of the older 40 pin cables.  The extra 40 conductors are ground, allowing for more reliable data transmissions at higher speeds.  BIOS is simply informing you that although your IDE controller supports at least ATA 66, the data cable connected to it does not.|`|3LHsCLVFaa	Temporary fix.

You can upgrade the HDD up to high as you want as far storage goes, as long as it's the same type of HDD (IDE or Sata). <br>  <br>  As far as Desktops go, it all depends on the Motherboard and the card slots available on it. Another thing to consider is that some sound and graphic cards have a power requirement, so make sure your power supply is capable of providing power to the card.<br>  <br>  On the Motherboard you are looking for PCI and PCI Express slots and on some older pcs AGP slots.|`|ffqsWfZtaa	Your stuck with the graphics card - but maybe it uses shared memory so you could go into the BIOS and increase its memory allocation.<br>  <br>  Sound card - no, but maybe USB speakers would help.<br>  <br>  Hard disk - not a problem, but make sure of thickness and interface type (IDE or SATA).

ZkELw9wzaa	Your school filter can detect a proxy as soon as you try it and either block it on the fly or notify an admin to block it manually. The bottom line is that all proxy's will eventually get blocked. As the filtering software gets more advanced they will get blocked faster and faster.<br>  <br>  There is also the question of the rules and laws you are breaking by trying to hack your school security system.<br>  <br>  Finally even if you got a proxy to work for a short time you are inviting the proxy owner, many of whom are using the proxy for hacking purposes, to infect and or hijack your school network. Read more on the dangers of proxy's below.|`|td6WXhv4aa	1) Circumventing your School firewall or hacking it is illegal <br>  <br>  2) It's a violation of YA to ask questions that break the law<br>  <br>  3) This is not a question on security<br>  <br>  4) It's a violation of your School usage policy to circumvent|`|FgsRcuDpaa	Let's initially establish: Proxies are not a requirement.<br>  There is nothing that important that you have to circumvent the internet filter that can't wait until school/work is dismissed. If you are discovered using the school/company computers for restricted sites, you will endure severe consequences. It's honestly not worth the tough repercussions involved.<br>  There are plenty of sites your computer will allow that are far better than that, and worth your time. Attempting to dodge security software processors will land you in sharp consequences.<br>  They are blocked for several reasons, and there is no changing that. With the multitude of computer viruses spreading around, companies cannot take any chances.<br>  Bypassing the filters set-up by companies is near impossible.

I would advise you to legally buy or rent the movies.<br>  <br>  But they both work basically the same way, the only real difference is limewire searches for you and it also allows you to share your files to the world.  Tourrents you need to search manually, but you don't share your files (except the ones you download you help feed the network).<br>  <br>  Because of this you  can't trust files on limewire to be what they appear to be until after you have downloaded them.<br>  <br>  Overall I would say torrents are safer.<br>  <br>  WARNING: Either way they are both illegal for what you want to use them for.|`|IGxtINxgaa	Torrents For sure !!!|`|a66nvk0taa	Torrents contain viruses, you been told that it's a movie etc next you have download a virus|`|dkF5oAnmaa	Torrents are usually faster because they are more releiable and people that download them review the files and say whether they work or not, depending what site you use.

However, you will lose your files if you don't follow the following instructions. <br>  <br>  I suggest you make a backup (or copy to a new folder you may call backup) of your files in c:\Documents and Settings\username, where "username" is your current user name. Then, create a new user name, for instance if your current "username" is Tim, then create a new user named Tim2.  Go to Control Panel>User Accounts in windowsXP.<br>  <br>  Give this new user Administrator privileges.  Restart your computer and you will have two choices to log in as Tim or as Tim2.  Choose Tim2 and go back to Control Panel>Users Accounts. Delete user Tim (assuming you followed and backed it up first).  The computer will ask you if you want to delete all of the user's files, say "Yes".  Now, restart your computer.  You should not get the login choices we talked about earlier.  <br>  <br>  Finally if you need a file that was under the old user, go to your backup folder to get it.

Almost all malware targets administrator accounts (the ones set up in Windows by default) and get their hooks into system files.

Type this into the web address bar at the top. You should see a menu (if asked for a password and user name and you don't have one, try typing "admin" as the user name and leaving the password blank, or viceversa). On one of the sub menus you should be able to "reset router settings" (usually on the front page). Click that, reset your computer, router and modem, and then go back to that menu.

TC0BaS1maa	My answer to why any Microsoft product does the things it does is, "Because it can". :) But all kidding and Microsoft-bashing aside...<br>  <br>  The size of an image is not a function of the size of a table cell. An image has a fixed size (which you can and should specify with height and width properties). I think some browsers will tolerate those not being specified, but as a general rule, whenever you give the browser less information, you're essentially asking it to interpret your wishes. Don't be surprised if it does so in a way that you don't like.<br>  <br>  As far as the tables are concerned, if you need them to be a fixed size, you should specify that size in height and width. Be aware though, if you put something in a table cell that exceeds the size of the cell (say you have a graphic that's 300 pixels wide, and you put it in a table cell that's 200 pixels wide), most browsers will expand the table cell to accommodate.<br>  <br>  Perhaps that's what happening here, I don't know without seeing your code and knowing the dimensions of your image(s).<br>  <br>  Browser compatibility is the bane of Web designers. You'll never get one browser to behave exactly the same as another. You can curse the browser for some time, then learn to adapt and write code that the majority of browsers will tolerate.<br>  <br>  Others might suggest, btw, that you use CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). Using tables for formatting has fallen out favor, as CSS theoretically overs much greater control and other advantages. However, in my experience, there's a much wider variance in browsers' interpretation of CSS.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|4d3Ie5lCaa	Well come to the world of web development, where IE is the only villain. <br>  <br>  Try using a css framework instead, like "blueprint" or "960".<br>  <br>  blueprintcss.org|`|yvDzvIbBaa	i have blocked IE from all my websites, its a pig. if people want to see my sites they can install firefox or something.<br>  <br>  its just a useless browser.<br>  <br>  you need to use an ''if IE'' command to get past it, basically make the site twice, 1ce for IE and 1ce for all the others. i preffer just to block them.|`|854662b4b6098e523f95f5d734db611eaa	Those who refuse to accept the existence (and predominance) of IE in browsers are not designers, and not even amateurs.<br>  IE users are 44.8%, Firefox are 45.5%, while chrome is only 3.9% (but growing fast!), and safari and Opera share the last 5%.<br>  So, sorry, but "no": IE does not mess your website: YOU do.<br>  If you resize your images using width/height, YOU mess it up.<br>  If you use the wrong arguments, YOU mess it up.<br>  If you use a WYSIWYG software like Dreamweaver, you are GUARANTEED to mess it up with the majority of browsers (not only IE!)<br>  The list of incompatibilities between browsers is very long, way too long to specify here.  <br>  I would only say one major incompatibility: <table> layouts versus <div> layouts:<br>  For the last three years, I have tried to get all layouts in <div> style (since soo many people advice to go to <div>'s, and that W3C recommend to use <div>'s).<br>  NO TWO BROWSER respond conrrectly to whatever W3C recommendations stipulates for divs!<br>  (AppleWebKit - Chrome and Safari - does NOT have anything in their specs concerning <div>s.  They "do" work, but very badly.<br>  Result?<br>  Back to <table width="xxx%"> for a good, reliable layout that WORKS on ALL browsers.<br>  Question is: What do you supply to your clients?  A job that works ONLY on IE, or on FF, or on Chrome?<br>  I guarantee my applications to work on any browser.<br>  They use tables.<br>  So what?<br>  It is up to YOU to review every line of code, every argument, every style, every syntax and make sure it "looks the same" on AT LEAST: IE, FF, Safari, Chrome and Opera.<br>  Fail in one, and you are not a professional.

Determining the offending cell(s) should help you figure out what the problem is.<br>  <br>  Or start with just two data point, add the trendline, and add remaining datapoints one at a time watching for the trendline to disappear.<br>  <br>  I havent been able to come up with a pattern of positive NON ZERO numbers that will break a trendline.

Do this:<br>  <br>  1) Delete the preferences file for the Finder.   File name is com.apple.finder.plist and can be found in YourHomeFolder -> Library -> Preferences.   Reboot.<br>  <br>  2) During reboot, hold the shift key.  Don't release it until you get to the log in screen.  And yes, you will get the log in screen even if you have automatic log in enabled.  Doing the will rebuild and optomize the file structure.   This is something you should do every week. Reboot<br>  <br>  3) During reboot, immediately after the startup tone, press Control, Option, P, and R and hold them until you hear the startup tone four more times (five total).  This resets the parameter RAM.  After the boot finishes, reboot again.<br>  <br>  This will most likely that care of the problem.  If not, reinstalling the OS is the thing to do.  Again, make certain to select the option to install the OS while saving user accounts.  You will have to run Software update after this.  If Software Update requires a restart, then run Software Update again after restart until it no longer finds anything to install.

If the file open returns a pointer of some sort to the file, return the pointer.  In fact, the function can receive the pointer by reference and modify it in place.  If it's -1 when it returns, there's an error, otherwise the main function can use it.  (Or different negative values can indicate different errors, so the main function can put up the correct error message.)

Q7qGw2a7aa	Storing a 1-way cypher on a cookie is probably OK for mild things, since it's a 1-way cypher, it can't really be decrypted. (but there are caveats of course) session variables have the same problem, you can "hi-jack" someones session. <br>  <br>  In the way-back machine, unix systems used to store passwords in /etc/password using something a 1-way cypher.. they still do, but it's usually in a different file nowadays. <br>  <br>  For really super secure stuff, you should look into PKI files and SSL, this is cumbersome though. (this way, only people with the PKI file could access your site... no passwords) this is probably overkill for 90% of the sites out there though.<br>  <br>  Designing a login system is a lot more complicated than people make it out to be! password changes, name changes, password reminders, other information specific to that user (such as phone numbers or names) you can see where it's going...<br>  <br>  You'll want to make it object oriented so that other pages can use it. (don't just use a session variable and access it directly if you can help it.. should your implementation change.. you'd be screwed, but with decent object oriented design and MINIMAL methods, you can change the underlying implementation and have the rest of your site.. possibly hundreds of files or more.. continue to operate.<br>  <br>  Here's my login system:<br>  <a href="http://www.geniegate.com/listings/dolphin/" rel="nofollow">http://www.geniegate.com/listings/dolphi...</a><br>  <br>  You can plug that into an existing website if you wish, to help minimize the hassles, it has a "php generator" function that will create a bit of PHP code to insert in the beginning of any PHP page to protect.<br>  <br>  I've had to work on a lot of code relying on "if($_SESSION[...])" and I can tell you from first hand experience.. these designs are not well thought out and they can be a real liability as your site grows.

This brings up a network login box where you type in the user name "Administrator" and whatever your password is.|`|CukNsDPJaa	I've never seen this before, and I suspect you somehow disable the administrator account without realizing it.  You should be able to find out by going to Control Panel>Users and Groups and checking if the account shows as disabled.<br>  <br>  Are you sure it's gone, though?  Try typing Administrator in the user name field and supplying the password; you may be surprised.<br>  <br>  Also, try booting into safe mode and supplying admin credentials there.  On pro systems, that's the ONLY way of gaining access to the admin account.|`|q7MIcWBBaa	are you using fast user switching and fast logon?  if so, go to control panel, into user management section and turn it off .. reboot and it'll load a welcome screen for you .. type "administrator" w/ your pw and you should be fine .. you can't delete the administrator account for security reasons so it's still there, just have to do some work to find it ;]
