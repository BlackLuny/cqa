20081217021042AADzs4l	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Avete mai passato dei mesi senza avere amici?	Le persone che pensavate fossero vostri amici, coloro che uscivano con voi ogni giorno e che condividevate tutto.... ad un certo punto vi abbandonano..vi lasciano completamente soli......   Non vi cercano più, non si fanno più sentire o lo fanno poco.   Vi evitano, non vi aiutano nel momento del bisogno.      Vorreste uscire e svagarvi ma non sapete con chi, perchè non avete più amici, e se qualcun'altro vi chiede di uscire voi rifiutate per paura, per mancanza di voglia, per depressione....      Eppure non siete toalmente soli, perchè avete la famiglia, i conoscenti che incontri per caso e che sn felici di vederti ma non è la stessa cosa come frequentarli...      Vi siete mai trovati in una situazione simile? Soli, senza amici? Senza nessuno con cui confidarsi e nessuno con cui fare shopping o semplicemente andare a prendere un caffè?      Io si....

20090219225138AAFxb2h	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	Expected reaction from adopted children?	In my future I plan on adopting four children. Though from what I'm reading it seems like a majority of people who had been adopted do a complete 180 once they find out they were adopted. As if their adopted parents don't mean anything because they are not biologically their parents. I can't believe that some people call parents strangers when they raised them a majority of their life, that excludes unfit adopted parents.      Now I wouldn't expect gratitude or praise and worship just because I adopted. But god would it be hurtful to be thought of as a stranger or not a real parent after all of those years of nurture and love.       As an adopted parent how did you handle the situation? Did your relationship with your children change? Did they gain a stronger bond with their biological parents?      As a future aparent, how should I deal with this if my children react in such a way?      I do plan on gaining as much information on their biological parents as I can, or as much as they will allow, for medical and personal reasons.

20090220002918AALZyzg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I don't feel anything?	I am 22 weeks pregnant with my first. But i am worried as im having very mixed emotions about the pregnancy and becoming a mum.  I have been pregnant before which ended in miscarriage but i felt a really strong connection to the baby even though i was only 5 weeks along. This time around, i dont feel that same connection. Sometimes I get so excited when i think about my baby.. but other times i dont really feel anything towards her. is this normal? I know this doesnt sound very nice.. and it really bothers me that i feel like this. Has anyone else experienced this?

20090219231909AA7VDwZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Will my daughter really start to sleep through on her own?	My daughter (9 months next week) still wakes to nurse at night. I have read that all babies learn to sleep right through on their own even without night weaning. We are hoping this is true because we have tried everything else to settle her back to sleep but nothing works other then feeding her. i really dont want to have to let her scream back to sleep so we are hoping what we read is true and that she will cut the night nursing out eventually. So basically Im just after some proof that I dont need to let her scream to have her sleeping right through. Would love to hear from other mothers with sucess stories of children that learned on their own
20090220012040AAkO6UV	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	What should I do about my son, he wants to be a Neo-Nazi?	My son is 16 and he wants to be a Nazi. I never raised him to be hateful to different people, I’ve always been very close to him and he and I are still close. We are of German ancestry, and his grandfather was involved in the Nazi movement. At first he just had a big interest in World War II learning all he could about it and the Nazi movement, and I saw no problem with that. Then his father left us and he met this group of friends at school who I really don’t approve of, some of them are very involved in the Neo-Nazi organizations and have gotten him very interested in it. He recently got in a bad fight with a colored kid at school and was suspended for it. He said he wishes he would have lived during the 30s and 40s so he could be an SS officer. I don’t know what to do about him, he is very sweet around me but I know he lies about things he does and doesn’t act that nice when he’s out with his friends. what should I do?

20090220003457AAZYRdI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How much should a six week old be sleeping?	My son has never been a 'sleepy' baby by any means. He's always fed for an hour, slept for 15 minutes and then been awake ready to eat again or squirming. He's an active and energetic little guy and I'm used to that... but how many hours SHOULD a six week old sleep (if you're following generalizations)    He's hit a point now where he is awake all day, literally, with no naps, or no more than two fifteen minute naps in the day. Today he's been awake for 14 hours so far and is just settling in. He'll sleep 3 hours, feed, another 2, feed, and up 2 hours after that. Is it normal for babies to be so wakeful and active at this age? I've tried putting him to bed earlier but it's just no good - he won't sleep before 1 am, in fact he usually really fights sleep. He'll have dark bags under puffy eyes by the time he nods off and even then he fights to keep his eyes open. Can anyone think of a reason for how wakeful he is and why he might fight sleep so resolutely?

20090220003212AA2EePF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Can anyone help with these names?	So my Grandma's middle name was Ruth and her Momma's name was Emma. They're both more old fashioned and not my style but I would like to honor them because no one else in the family plans on using those names. I'm not pregnant but me and my boyfriend will be married within the next year and have been talking about baby names lately. I really would like to use both names but make them into one name so I can use them at the same time. I don't want to make it too long by doing Emma-Ruth, but I do want the first part to be Emma and the second part to be Ruth....Can anyone please help me come up with a way to spell a name that would use both of them...just to have it on my list?? I want it to be easily read and something that would be pronounced right. We already have a lot of names, but if anyone would like to try and come up with a first or middle name to go with their spelling I would really appreciate it <3      Thanks everyone (:

20090219234846AAWzJqy	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Pregnancy after miscarriage question?	So, I asked a question about this a few weeks ago, but am still confused.   On Dec 28, I had a miscarriage at about 4-5 weeks.  I did not have a D&C, so I just bled for about 5-6 days.  About 4 weeks later, I took a pregnancy test to check if my hormone levels were down enough to make a test come out negative and it did.   Since the miscarriage began (12/28), I have not had a period at all.  So Sunday (2/22) will make 8 weeks.  During these past almost 2 months, there were a couple of times I thought I may have ovulated, and since doc gave us the ok to try again as soon as I stopped bleeding, we tried.  Of course we have "tried" other times than just when I thought I saw CM, but I really have no idea when I actually ovulated.     This past week, I started having sore/tender breasts (not a typical period thing for me) and a feeling of abdominal fullness/ slight cramping.  I took a test a few days ago, and it came out negative, so I thought for sure my period would start soon.  Well... still nothing.  I do have some mucous that is clear and thick-ish, but not gooey like CM (TMI... sorry).  At this point I'm wondering what in the world is going on.  I'm not sure if I may be pregnant again, but it's too early to tell bc I have no idea when to expect my period.  I know I can wait and retest, and I probably will, but I want to know what your opinion is on what's going on and what (other than wait and retest) I should do.  I'm already taking prenatal vitamins and not doing dangerous pregnancy things, just in case I am preg., but is there anything else I should do?

Now we've been letting her sleep longer and longer and the other day, we sort of overslept and she slept for 6 hours straight!

20070514095407AAPLOIp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is this my period or spotting?	How's everyone doin? Hopefully good. Im enjoying this beautiful weather out here, though my allergies are killing me. okay..to start with my story. Ive been with a guy for awhile now and we've had unprotected sex. Im pretty sure he didnt pull out when the time came. I was supposed to get my period 5 days ago. I freaked out the second day it was late and took a test. It came out negative so it releaved some stress on me and i figured " hey. thats wonderful. it should come tomorrow" boy was i wrong. It's been six days now and im just started to bleed but its light pink and not so heavy. Is this just a sign of a late period, no worries or could it be spotting[[me pregnant]]? Hopefully someone can help me out... Thank you :)

20070620004012AAQ3mtB	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	My friend is pregnant, going into 11th; is there anything that guarantees her right to education, at age 16+?	She lives in Virginia, if that helps, and I'm looking for any laws, statutes, or policies which would guarantee her right to an education -- her family will not support her, or her baby, so she may be forced to find somewhere else to live with the child. She is worried about her schooling, for obvious reasons.   There may not be anyone to care for baby when she is at school; could she be kicked out if she brought baby with her? The school does not have a daycare service. Are there any laws in the area which support her? Does the government offer any type of assistance for teen mothers who are still in school? [daycare, specifically]    Well, you can see the dilemma; any advice or information offered is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.

20081028173318AAgAZFj	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	How do people decide which name to use?	I'm really wondering this because it's such a huge decision. This is a name your child will carry for their entire life (unless they change it of course) and a name you will write and say millions of times. So how do people make such a momentous decision?       BTW I volunteer with a lot of differently named kids. There are some crazy names out there and I realize that it's not really the name that matters but the child. I'm actually growing to like many of the names, even the really odd ones. Still it's a label we wear for life, so how does this work?

20080930051806AAprpki	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	I know it's a long shot but...?	I love the name Tess and have been asking questions about what else it could be short for other than Tessa, Teresa etc...      I came up with Anastasia which I quite like, but wasn't sure about as I would hate the possible alternative nickname Stacy which I think is a bit chav.      So I started using babynamesgarden.com to search names containing 't's, 'e's and 's's or at least 2 of them and fiinally found a name i liked: Alexis. I know Tess is a bit of a long shot as a nickname for that, but if she was always called it and introduced herself to people as Tess it would catch on - just as my daughter Isabelle is always referred to as Elsie even though the natural nickname for Isabelle might be Izzy. Do you like the name Alexis? Or do you prefer Anastasia?

Es una curiosidad, quiero saber porqué no se cuidan cuando tienen relaciones (es por desinformación?) Como pueden disfrutar del sexo si después están preocupados por un embarazo no deseado?    Otra cosa: Sólo les preocupa un embarazo, y el SIDA o HIV, no les preocupa? porqué no se cuidan?    No creo que sea por falta de dinero, porque en muchos países los preservativos los consigues gratis, adémás si tienen dinero para comprar la pastilla post day, seguramente pueden comprarse condones....

20080402194445AAjaAOQ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	Is a child better off when a parent stays home instead of working?	I really have no one to compare my son to (not that you should) but I am wondering if he is better off for me staying home rather than working.  I am a single parent whose mother has offered to let me live in her apartment that she's not using for free (I pay for my own utilities, etc)--but that has come at a high price for me (overly controlling mother who just can't resist making comments at every turn on EVERYTHING!!--but that is another story).  I am a full time student who up until this coming fall has taken online classes.  I can't do that any more and so my son will be in daycare for 2-3 days a week.  He really wants to go to school and is very excited about it.  Plus he will get to go with me to the campus.  He doesn't have any friends but the people we live around do not speak English and will not let their kids play with him.  He is very social though.  I just don't klnow what he should be doing right now.  He is 3 and a half and knows:

20081025125237AAp63ze	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Future kids names? What do you think?	SORRY THIS IS QUITE LONG.      My boyfriend and i are already decided on seven kids names we have five boys names and two girl's name.      I want to know what you think about these names.   Ronald Allan "Ronnie"    Gabriel Martin   Alfred James "Freddie"   Samuel Geoffrey "Sam"   Thomas William "Tom"      the girls names we like are;   Emily Louise   Lucy Irene      the reasons behind the names are   Ronald/Ronnie - i have a baby cousin called Reggie and is named after my late grandfather Reginald. My grandfather also had a brother named Ronald.   Allan - is Reggie's father and my uncle (my mum's bro).      Gabriel - i love this name with the middle name Martin.   Martin - My uncle's name (Mum's oldest sister's husband)      Alfred - because i like the nickname of Freddie and Frederick would be too predictable.    James - is my brother's & uncle's middle name.      Samuel - i love this name, i've always wanted a kid called Sam and i have an auntie Sam (my dad's bro's wife)   Geoffrey - my bf's uncle's name      Thomas - i like this name almost as much as Samuel.   William - my bf's grandfather's name. It's also his cousin's name.      Emily - my late cousin who died a long time ago and i like the name, i would've changed it to Emma, so it wasn't quite the same but my bf doesn't like it.   Louise - my uncle Allan's girlfriend and i really like the name with Emily as the first name.      Lucy - i like the name & so does bf.   Irene - my maternal grandmother's name.      What do you think? Do i have good reasons for naming them that? Or are they silly? And what are your opinions on the names?      The names are also not as common as current names. Other names we like are    BOYS; David, Kristian, Robert, Brian, Scott, Alexander, Kavan, Quinn, Doyle, Hunter (after Triple H because bf is a wrestling fan)   GIRLS; Alexandria, Rebecca, Taylor,       I like the middle name Julian for a boy as well as Julie for a girl but bf hates the name Julian.      Julie would be one of the girl's middle names after my bf's mum.       I'd like to know what everyone thinks about these names.

20080321141948AAd4QkF	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Possibility of pregnancy?	Last night me and my girlfriend had sex without a rubber. before we had sex she told me that she just got off her period. i know the most effective way to conceive is to have sex while ovulating. well her period was about 8-9 days long. she usually has about a 28 day cycle, so her ovulation usually lands on the 14th day. Anyway, we were having sex unprotected, when i felt like i was close to coming, i quickly pulled out, and finished myself off for like 2-3 seconds before i came. I know precum doesnt have sperm in it unless u ejaculated previously without urinating. so i was wondering what would be the chances of this? We usually have sex all the time with condoms, we just chose to do it this time without a condom. hey she enjoyed it, but im not enjoying the paranoia. any chances of this situation being very slim of pregnancy?      Also, i had been drinking last night and urinated plenty of times before we had sex, just to let u know on that.

20081009230445AA61Dva	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	I have some boy troubles?	so basically, there's this guy that goes to my school, and we talk on myspace all the time, and we've gotten really close, then I fell for him.   what can I say? we used to talk alot, and all of a sudden it just kinda stopped. we would hug all the time and then that stopped, everything just kind of went to a hault. I miss it.   anyway I've caught him looking/staring at me, but not in a mean way or anything like that, just kind of looking at me.      this other guy is always hugging me and putting his arm around me, and thats usually when I catch him staring at me.   the funny thing is, most girls would give their right arm to have that guy (thats always hugging me and stuff) do that to them,    but I dont like him, I like the other guy. :)      I have a couple of questions:   why is he staring at me?   Is there anything I can do to make him fall for me?   and   How can I talk to him without seeming too desperate, like without letting him know that I miss talking to him... a lot.

20090203121518AAigJlh	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	A question about multiple births?	This is something that I've noticed when I come on to the baby names section of yahoo answers and I'm on here on a regular basis.       But every time I am on, I see a lot of questions regarding multiple births. Women and men asking for advice on naming twins, triplets, quads, quints, and sometimes even more.      I realize that some of these people are genuine but does anyone else not think it is quite amazing how lots of these supposed mothers/fathers lucky to be pregnant with multiples come on to yahoo answers and ask for advice on what to name their babies?      Multiple births are rare, and yet there are always lots of questions on here regarding names for more than one baby. Quite amazing or what?      I'm not having a go at any genuine mother/father  to be who has asked for advice on naming multiples and I hope I've not caused any offense. I do realize that some people are genuine but I really don't believe that everyone on yahoo answers is pregnant with multiples when its rare.      But if you are an expectant parent of multiples whether it be twins, triplets, quads, quints or even more then good luck with your new arrivals!!!! Or even if your having one baby good luck!!!!

The region of my back just above my hips/waist is very sore, its only been like this for around 2 days. In between my ribs the muscles hurt, it also feels like i tore a muscle around my ovaries. Like you know if you stretch you get a really painful twinge. I had been constipated so i took something for that. But at the same time im scared i could be pregnant. Last time we had sex was like 5 days ago. We always use a condom...but now i just am so scared. I took plan b in december, and got a full period in the beggining of january. I also am having headaches/ neck stiffness. I went for a blood test yesterday because i am so sick of being scared but if im getting implantation bleeding then...it wouldn't have picked it up would it have. My period isn't due till like the 14th. Help im really scared. what should i do?

20090220020031AAoaDfc	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Periods while pregnant?	Anyone ever found out they were pregnant a few days after their period? Anyone ever had regular periods throughout their pregnancy? If so, were your periods normal or were they lighter? I'm getting what seems like implantation bleeding (brown discharge) but I've not long finished my period and the last time I had sex was before my period. Is it still possible for me to be pregnant? Thanks in advance!
20090220012045AAfqZEt	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Question for moms that went back to work....?	ok this is my situation. i have a 17 m/o and i work full time (nights, 7p-7a) so when i get home my husband goes to work and i NEED to sleep after working 12 hours. my daughter lets me sleep till about 10, im up for a few hours and then go for a nap about 1-4, then i get up and play with her and get ready for work. im running on empty, and with the job market the way it is, i am holding onto my job for dear life (its a very rewarding job and we cannot survive on just my husbands income, so please dont suggest i quit my job, its just not an option for us.)      i have another baby coming... any tips on handling this now, and when my new baby comes in 4 months? my husband is VERY supportive and en EXCELLENT father, so he will be ok with our son keeping him up al night once i return to work.
20090220014202AA3SD7t	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	When should i put my daughter in a 'big girl' bed?	my daughter is 17 m/o and yesterday she escaped from her crib. she didnt get hurt, she actually thought it was really hilarious and was really proud of herself. she also can escape from her pack and play. this is really dangerous, although it is kind of funny to watch (i have to hide to watch, she wont do it if she knows im looking) so we know its probably time for a toddler bed with rails, but she is such a crazy sleeper! should we just completely baby proof her room (take all the little potential hazards out that we dont even think twice about cause shes never alone with access to them)  and go for the big girl bed? or is 17 months too young?
20090203121549AA6axS7	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Would you let your child go with his father?	Some of you are familiar with the problems I have been having with my husband, for those of you who are not, here's whats up...      My husband had an affair, and I have since told him to leave the house and we are divorcing. He has not been very nice to me since then for some reason. He threatened me last week saying he was going to take my son away and not give him back until a judge said he had to (which I found out he could do with no legal consequences as we have not been to court yet and set up custody nor are we even officially divorced) Since he made those threats, he hasn't asked to take my son anywhere, he comes to the house to see him, because the friends he is staying with smoke in the house, so he can't take him there. But this morning he asked me if he could take Sam to his Mom's house this weekend. This has me absolutely terrified. I always promised myself I would never use my son to hurt my husband or deny him access to him, because that is hurting Sam also, but I just don't want to let him take him. I'm afraid he won't bring him back. He is the one who ruined our family, and then threatened to take my son away. Everyone says he is just mad and ashamed and he doesn't mean what he says and he would never do that, but that what-if is still in the back of my head. My son is the only thing keeping me going right now, if I didn't have him, I would lose all sanity.      So, would you let your child go, and try and reassure yourself that everything will be okay?       Or take his threats seriously and hold onto your baby as tight as you can?

I was put on birth control because my cycles were a little weird. Sonogram discovered I have may have Adenomyosis.

20090220023655AA0EZ5l	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	5 weeks pregnant, had sex, cramped really bad.. now bleeding?	I havent been to a doctor yet, but i was supposed to get my period on Valentines day, which means its 6 days late. Im never this late, and im experiencing pregnancy symptoms, so i just know im pregnant. I have taken 2 HPT's and they've come out negetive, but im possitive im pregnant. I had originally planned on going to the doctors for an initial test, on this coming up Tuesday, but something happened...      Ok, so i havnt had sex since about the time i concieved on the 2nd of February, but i've had sex yesterday twice with hubby, and the 1st time it was ok at first, but after a while, i started to feel soooo bad, like a major cramp, with no bleeding. Then i felt better after about an hour or so and we did it again, but this time it didnt hurt.       I was fine up until it was time for me to lie down and go to bed. I was feeling a little crampy, as if i was actually on my period, which i heard was normal, so i didnt think that much about it. And now im up at 530am, and i just looked at my panties (sorry tmi), and theres brownish red spots, not enough to fill a pad, or tampon, but its still there. and im still feeling crampy.   My question is, has this ever happened to anyone before? Is this normal?
20090203121233AAft3jg	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Mothers only please.. period after giving birth?	I gave birth to my daughter almost 5 months ago. I did not breastfeed (do not judge you dont know my situation) and got my period about a month after I gave birth. Ever since then it has been extremely heavy lasting for about 10 days and coming every 2-3 weeks. When im not on my period I am PMSing really bad. I get terrible headaches (where I cant even move or look at the light), backaches, cramps and am very unpleasent to be around. Is this normal and when does it go away if ever?

He is very disobedient He often does things that could seriously hurt him (jumping off things, playing with matches). My dad doesn't like me spanking him. Talking to my brother never seems to work.He does whatever he wants to. I told my parents that I won't babysit again until they let me handle him accordingly. How can we come to a compromise?      Thanks in advance:)

20090220015603AACwqWk	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	My sons father is playing mind games....?	Ok, my sons father has been playing mind games. He moved in with another female while I was pregnant and we were supposed to be together. So he lied and cheated while I was pregnant. Our son is 2 months old now. The father now says he is sorry and he is in love with me and wants to be with me but it will be a little while yet before he moves out of his girlfriends house. What would you say to this? Would it be wrong of me to tell him in the morning when I see him and pick up my son to choose right here right now who he wants to be with? And if its really me then to pack his sh*t and either move in with me or get his own place TODAY, but if he cant do that then obviously his heart does not really belong to me, right? Am I wrong? Am I overreacting? We have a 2 month old son together! Why cant he just move out of the other womans house and move in with me and our child?
20090220010657AAaWCwM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	My sons father has my kids and he's ignoring me?	Ok, tonight is the first night I have let my sons father watch my kids for the night cuz I work nights.  I have a 2 month old son by him, and a 3 year old daughter that is not his but she calls him daddy, too.  My sons father and I are not together and we have been having major issues lately and been fighting a lot about his new girlfriend that wants absolutely nothing to do with our son nor does she want him to have anything to do with his son.  So he took both my kids for the night but then all of a sudden he texted me and said my daughter was going crazy and he was gonna come bring her to me.  He knew I had to work.  Then I didnt hear from him for 2 whole hours, I was texting him and calling him and he wasn't responding.  Finally 2 hours later he texted me and said my kids were fine.  I asked him what they were doing and about 15 min later he texted me saying "nothing".  I asked him where he was and  then he texted me "dont worry about your kids, go back to work".  Like WTF?  This is the FIRST time I've trusted you enough to take my kids out of my house knowing you got a girlfriend that hates my son and you actin like this?  Not tellin me what my kids are doing?  I have a 2 month old son!!!  Is he sleeping?  Is he crying?  Is he eating?  Is my daughter asleep?  What do you mean my kids are doing nothing?  Am I feel like telling him he cant take my kids out anymore if he cant even let me know how they are doing.  Am I just overreacting?
20090220010937AAVurcw	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Worried - 36 weeks pregnant, Strep B, 2nd baby?	I've been tested positive for Strep B - after reading up about it i've realised just how common it is.       My concern is, that i've heard a second labour 'tends' to be quicker than the first.. I've been told and also read that for Strep B i'll be having anti biotics by IV as soon as I go into labour - and 'ideally' its best to have 2 courses of it - every 4 hours...       What happens if my labour is only a couple of hours? what happens if I dont get to the hospital in time?  I dont want to keep ringing them after every twinge but at the same time im scared that it might go really quick and that I wont get enough anit biotics in time to prevent my baby being infected :(       I didnt have this with my first.  The midwife says the babies head is engaged 3/5 too.
20090220022742AAqUzfr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	The hardest decision ever iv had to make .. should i abort my 12 week old baby?	I had a healthy three year old in 2005 then in 2007 i fell pregnant and carried my baby full term before she was born still born this was very hard for me a very difficult and pregnancy and an emotional birth i never got to hold my baby and i yearned for a child .within six months i was pregnant again and my baby was born early at 24 weeks he came home november 2008 after spending four months in nicu and has been in and out of ospital since he came home he is doing well now hes 11 pound and is seven months old.. four month corrected age and we all love him to pieces ... however he is poorly and has a lot of medical problems hes on home oxygen has hearing loss and suffers cerebal palsy his development is slow and he needs a lot more attention then a normal baby of his age. i got a implant fitted  shortly after his birth but fell into depresion and was on medication perscribed by my gp which reacted with the implant and i have now ended up pregnant again ... im in termoil and dont know what to do. my patner dose not think we should keep the baby as we need to focus our attention on my youngest son who is going through a lot latley and he said he could not cope if anything was to happen and the pregnancy was complicated in any way . i dont know what to do i dont think i can physically go through another pregnancy and birth so soon  but i suppose i wouldfind the strength from somewhere. and on the same note after losing my daughter and going back to the thoughts and feelings i had then i dont think emotionally or physically i could terminate the pregnancy and not even give this baby a chance of survival. i really dont know what to do. No nasty comments please.

20090203121718AA30Qs1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	How common is it to get your period while being pregnant?	Okay, so i think i'm pregnant. If i was i'd be six weeks long by now. I think i am still getting my period but i still believe i'm pregnant. How common is it to get your period while being pregnant because i know it happens, i just don't know my odds.          Also, today i had a really discustly bloody thing i coughed up today. I quit smoking about 3 months ago so it has nothing to do with that... but it looked like i had a period coming out through my mouth. Does that have anything to do with being pregnant? Like, does it mean miscarriage or something? I don't know much about being pregnant, i'm only 18 years old but i have been relying on BabyCenter.com for most of my information so i am getting there....

The birds and the trees, they saw us gel   together with each other, all so well.      We laughed, we cried, we shared our thoughts and feelings,   we cherished under the sun, our ride on the swings   of life and of wisdom, through which we'd decided to move together,   and stay close to the heart of one another.

20090220022243AAVUBc3	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	What are some of your excuses before people know you are pregnant?	It's still too early for me to be telling people I'm pregnant (only 7 weeks) so I've been constantly lying about things which I don't like.  I never knew how much heavy lifting I did in my day to day life - mostly at work because I have an outside job - and then there is the not drinking thing (even when you are staying the night at someone's house so technically could drink), the not eating certain foods (suddenly asking for my eggs to be cooked thoroughly) etc.  Surely it is obvious that I am lying about something but I don't think I should have to tell people if I don't want to < I would hate to go back with sad news.  So just wondering how others have handled things?  Thanks

If the little boy makes one sound that even sounds like a cry she is by his side.  I'm no expert, but isn't this a tad excessive and borderline bad for his emotional training?  I know I can't say anything to her about it, I guess I just need to see if others agree that he needs to be independent and learn that I can calm him down.

The reason I didn't start her sleeping in her own bed was because when she was born i breastfed her until she was 1 year old, and after that we moved into a 1 br apartment and i couldn't afford a bed for her (i am a single parent) and now i can afford the 2 bedroom, she has her own room, and i even tried the whole letting her pick out her own theme thing, and it didnt work! She has this adorable pink princess room, i bought her a lamp and a night light, and i put little christmas lights above her bed, but she is scared. I lay her in her bed and she wakes up in the middle of the night so scared that she shakes and tries to run to my room but she's so worked up and she just trips all over herself. When she does that i feel awful! like i'm a terrible mother for letting her get so scared! She's always been a jumpy little girl, shes scared of loud noises and being alone and the dark, even when i was pregnant with her and there was a loud noise i could feel her jump a little bit in my tummy. I tried talking to her, and i told her that we'll keep the lights on, and the doors open so i can hear her talk. But the second i leave the room she runs out to me. I am all out of ideas, someone, PLEASE HELP!!!

I just posted a similar question but don't believe I worded my self right, I usually have my period early in the month I had sex in December after my period I'm not completely sure how soon after I got off my period but yeah. I miss my period in Jan. but didn't think nothing of it after wards in Feb. I remember having a period but don't believe it was as normal as mine usually are. My friends and I are around each other so much that we always have our periods right around the same time she has already had her period at the beginning of the month as usual and it's over with, where mine still hasn't started or even felt like I'm going to have it. I haven't been stressed lately or lost or gained any weight I check myself daily to see if I have. I'm really selflessnesse about things like this, I know the out comes of things like this and such and don't intend to use excuses yes I was drunk but I completely remember everything that night so have no use to use that excuse and don't intend to. Could somebody just please help orat leastt try to give me some help

It just about kills my back every time I bath him. He is wriggly and loves to kick about so holding him securley is quite hard to do!   I am finding an adequate way of bathing him quite hard to figure out.   He never smells clean and fresh afterwards and I seem to have to use half a container of baby wash at each bathing to make the water soapy enough!    Have tried being in the bath with him but too dangerous (for us both) as very slippery.   Has anyone got an idea as to how I can bath him easily for the sake of my back and so it is still fun for us both and so he comes out looking and smelling clean??   Please help as I dread bathtime as my back cannot handle it. Daddy is usually working so cannot help me...

Ok cutting a very long story short. at 5wks  and 5 days i was scan internally due previous miscarriage and they was only a ges sac and a small yolk inside my hcg was over 5000 then and my ges sac measured 5,5 but the doctor seem as if he should be seen more with my hcg been high (dnt no y that early). anyways i'm having this very long two weeks wait i go for a scan on the 25th feb to see if my baby as grown and there's a heartbeat or not. they wont measuree my hcg as if  it doesn't double then it will make me worry more whitch i understand but my question is all my lower back pain i had and my belly was a lot harder ( i think when i get pregnant some1 presses a button and i fill will water lol)  as all gone my boobs don't hurt anymore  or my teeth don't i dont have that much of a wait now but  could losing my symptom be a bad sign as its hard for me to say this but i JUST DON'TT FEEL PREGNANT ANYMORE  what should i do ?
20090220010815AATAq2j	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Could I possibly be pregnant?	K, here's all the information I think you need to know.   I'm 18 and my monthly usually comes every 1.5 to 2 months.      I got it Christmas day, ended the 30th, and I had unprotected sex on the morning of January 10th. (I know, I shouldn't but it was a one time stupid thing.) It was only like 4 "pumps" into it when i realized how stupid this was and I told him to stop. It wasn't more than like 10 seconds for real. He was NO WHERE close to finishing up. Also, he had just peed like 10 minutes before so there was no other fluids that could have remained from a previous ejaculation.       Ever since then I had been really really nervous about getting pregnant and I was super stressed about it.      Okay well around Dec.10th or so I noticed I had really sore breasts and stuff, but I'm told they're just growing... but I noticed that it didn't stop hurting until like Feb. 9      I got my period again on Feb. 7 but it was VERY light, only lasted 4 days, and there was heavy cramping.      After that I had no other symptoms that could be misinterpreted as pregnancy so I kinda didn't stress about it anymore, but now for the last few days I've been sleeping alot and my back hurts, so I'm nervous once again.      Is it even possible to be pregnant when so little happened? And I know a lot of people are going to say take a test, so I am also going to ask, is there a best time to take the test. I heard it's best in the morning but i usually work nights and sleep in the afternoon. Do they really mean the morning or just right before you wake up.      Thanks to anyone who trys to answer.

20090220015051AAcLnEs	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Early pregnancy - please help?	Please please please help me, I am so worried and need reassurance      Following a miscarriage with my first baby in September last year I was delighted to find out 3 weeks ago my husband and I are expecting again. My doctor has been monitoring me closely by taking blood tests and I had a refferal yesterday for a scan to the Early Pregnancy Unit.      I was unsure of my dates so the scan showed yesterday I was only 5 weeks gone, all we could see was the sac.      My blood test Hcg levels have been: -      Wed 4th Feb - 7   Tues 10th Feb - 151   Thurs 12th Feb - 546   Tues 17th Feb - 4351      All these tests were done at my Gp surgery      Thurs 19th Feb - 5357      This test was done in a different hospital yesterday and I got the result last night, have to go back tomorrow to the same hospital to get another blood test done.      I am so worried because my Hcg levels up to yesterday were rocketing and if they are supposed to double every 2 days so I was expecting yesterday's to be at least 8000, does it make a difference depending on where the blood tests are taken to the results, I mean do the Gp's and hospitals have different ways of testing what the level is?      I checked a page earlier and it said that in the case of ectopic or miscarriage the levels are normal and then start to slow down, does this look like the case for me?? I want this baby more than anything, please give me some advice xxxxx

20090220015824AAY3kBr	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How do i Get my 5 month old to fall asleep on her own!!!!?	okay. so for the past 5 months i have been getting my daughter to sleep only by breastfeeding her. she goes to bed with me and i breastfeed her on my side and she falls asleep and will stay asleep for about 8 hours. im just getting to the point now where i want to be able to put her in her crib and have her fall asleep. lately she hasnt been falling asleep till 4am. i will feed her. and she will just stay up. sometimes i put her in her crib after feeding her and she will just laugh and play with whatever she can find. even the blankets and coo. after she gets bored she will start crying. ive tried to let her cry for 10 min. but she wont stop after 10. and since we live in a town home i dont want our neighbors to hear her cry at 4 am. its hard for me and my husband to even sleep together anymore because she takes up the whole bed. sometimes he will just sleep on the couch. i dont want her to get used to owning our bed our mine and my husbands basically only time alone to have our daughter in between us.   (by the way we are very cautious when shes in our bed)    so no need to lecture us on that.

Hi, i have been TTC#1 for 5 months now (i know its not long compared to some people on here) but i found out in january that i have a backwards womb, nothing else showed up on the internal scan, and my partner has children already so it cant be him. i have read that most people dont have problems getting pregnant with a backwards womb, but it worries me that after 5 months that thats the reason. Im not charting my ovulation with sticks or temp, as i dont want to stress out too much about it. i start having sex from day 10-20 to cover ovulation, and i dont move for 20-30 mins after sex.       What else could i do? is it possible it could be my backwards womb does anyone else have this and had children?       i hope this is my month, Baby dust to all ttc       x

20090220024917AAJ5gfM	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Is smoking catnip dangerous during pregnancy?	I know that catnip tea can be dangerous in early pregnancy in large quantities. However, that seems to be specific to an "infusion" (i.e. tea), and I'm at 14 weeks, past a significant risk of miscarriage. And obviously smoking cigarettes is dangerous, but last I checked that was mostly because it restricts blood flow, which is an effect of the nicotine, not the smoke inhalation. Does anyone have a definitive answer here?    I used to do this before I got pregnant. It's mostly a stress thing for me...
20090220031212AAtXFuN	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Do kids become less valuable to parents after the parents divorce?	For example if a husband and wife divorce, their kids are constant reminders of their ex.  Maybe they have good reasons to really hate their ex.  The kids are made from the ex though.  They may look and act like the ex.  Even if they don't, they're constant reminders of a troubled past.      Sometimes there are news stories about people who kill their kids after divorce.  Some men go psycho after divorce and kill their (ex) family.  Some women meet a new man but the man sees the kids as obstacles, then the woman or man kills the kids.

20090220030543AA6gNJx	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	How do you cope with being the sibling of a child with cancer?	i have a little cousin called nicole, who is four years old. she is a very spoiled little girl, who always gets upset when she doesn`t get her own way. she was an only child raised by her single mother. aunt rose had recently got married again. her husband is a man called harry, who was a single father. he has a six-year-old daughter called jade. jade had also been greatly spoiled by her father, who doted on her. after the wedding, the two girls did not get along. nicole often tattled on jade and got her into trouble. jade thought nicole was an annoying little sister. unfortunately, jade got cancer and was in the hospital for ages. she had to undergo many treatments, including chemotherapy, which made all her curly hair fall out. when she got home, people gave her most of the attention. they let her have her own way because of her illness, which made nicole jealous and bitter. nicole feels ignored and left out. she threw temper tantrums and became greatly attention-seeking. she had even tried to fight with jade on some occasion.. there were times when she was mean to her sister. nicole had teased jade, called her names and took her anger out on her. when they go out as a family, jade might not feel well and they have to hurry her home. nicole would cry and scream because she wants to stay and play. aunt rose and uncle harry would just comfort her, saying"we have to go home now because your sister is tired. we will play later." what can i do to help them?

20090220031007AA2DvZW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adoption	Adopted children asking where they're from?	I have adopted two children in 2005 i adopted 16 yr old Samuel who was 13 at the time, when he was 13 he asked about where he was from as he had been in temporary foster homes since he was about 4. We took him to Nairobi for 3 weeks and took him to his home village , he met people who he was distantly related to and he saw many people living in crap homes, his relatives were horrible to him and we left early and stayed in a hotel for ten days, he was distraught at where the people were living and he made 3 little friends and he begged me to take them home with us, it broke his heart when i said no.       Then in 2008 ( exactly 1 year ago) i adopted a little girl Alexandra who is 13 now, she has asked me to take her to see where she was from, i have talk to the agency who have said that we should take the trip but im really unsure after what happened to Samuel, she is from Malawi and i believe her great grandfathers sisters daughter so her third cousin is still living there with her family of 14, i don't think we should take Alexie as it would hurt her, but am i being too harsh as i gave Sam that opportunity?

20090220032038AAh7d1U	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	How much sleep should a 7 month old have?	Hi, can anyone advise.  My 7 month old boy is really good and I am by no means complaining.  He sleeps through the night really well up until the last week he used to go at 9pm at night approx and wake around 8.30am in the morning.  The past few days he has been falling asleep early around 7pm and going through until 8.30am in the morning without his last feed of the evening.  Also he sleeps well during the day but I have noticed that he hasnt even finished his breakfast sometimes and he is rubbing his eyes ready for sleep again.  Is this normal.??
