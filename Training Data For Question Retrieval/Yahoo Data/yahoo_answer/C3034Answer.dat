4Ej32YBfaa	Royal Mail Postie here - 3 Options - check yellow pages for your local Royal Mail Delivery offices number and call it.  The Manager may not be aware there is a problem so call him to advise.  If he is aware he should be able to explain it.  This is the best option for a one off.<br>  <br>  Option 2 - complain to Royal Mail call centre or on-line through there own web page <a href="http://www.royalmail.com/portal/rm/jump3?catId=400144&mediaId=15500181" rel="nofollow">http://www.royalmail.com/portal/rm/jump3...</a><br>  <br>  Option 3 - Call Post watch or its replacement they are the consumers champion where Royal Mail is concerned.|`|318a6ed5ab942a8e6dd39a00efedfd1caa	Usually Royal Mail has very good service. <br>  You said that yourself, that they always used to turn up every morning, now they haven't turned up once and you are ready to complain to all possible ways?! <br>  Doesn't sound wise, dose it ?  <br>  You should be more worried about more important things then your post late one day ! <br>  Stop complaining on every little thing in your life ! |`|jyqFCoWTaa	I think it may be a general problem at the mo. <br>  <br>  I keep not getting mail for days but then all at once. It been like that for a few weeks now. Some of the mail is dated from upto 5 days ago or more. <br>  <br>  I am just going to leave it and see how it goes. Maybe they just have staffing problems. We usually have a good service around my area. I have noticed that we do have a different member of staff every time it is delivered now. So guessing staff shortage is the problem. <br>  <br>  |`|esRI2Dooaa	There could be a problem. If the regular postman has been sick, for example, they will hire some idiot from an agency who doesn't know what to do.|`|4qMNaCUIaa	now your gonna get poo covered leaves stuck through your letter box.|`|QQsIPlV2aa	It happens here in the USA too! What I have found out is, the usual Postman is on holiday, OR the Royal Mail has some new guy delivering! When I don't get Mail when I know I should be getting certain bills, I call the companies and ask them if they have sent them out yet! If the Poyal Mail can't come up with an answer, especially when it is not just you not getting your mail, get the whole street together and call the Media!! People hear them loud and clear, and it will embarass the Royal Mail to do something and start investigating the "missing" mail!|`|Cho46Re0aa	Well   usually are quite regular    ,  but they can have staff problems,  sickness  etc. same as any company,.  They cant always have extra staff available    just like that.   Probably the rounds have been altered  so thay you previously  were mear the start,  you   are now near the end,    This happens,  routes are changed from time to time.   Today might be an exception   No postman available probably,   Do a double drop tomorrow,   Why keep complaining about what is usually a good service  ,  Does it really matter,  dont think so    |`|pB9iIwFAaa	staff problems, sickness etc. same as any company,maybe your postman off sick.
