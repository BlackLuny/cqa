AA11739700	Don't pour water. Some owners get a large drinking bowl so it can go in and bathe itself. However it is not deep enough for it to drown, just enough for the lower body to be bathed.|`|vV425TqZaa	now this is a strong possibility! he may be going through brumination, hibernation for reptiles, they will sleep longer and eat less due to the cold seasons and will wake up at the end ready to breed and full of energy, this should be ending by now becuase it is getting through the cold season but it matters were u live personally.|`|AA11767019	My friends' son has a water dragon and they found out that theirs does that too if the temp in his tank gets too cool. Could it be that the cold water suddenly puts him into hibernation mode?|`|rrFbQZzIaa	unfortunately we would need more information to possibly answer this. Knowing the type of lizard may help. Different lizards have different care and live in different environments so doing something like you've done may have different effects to a polar bear compared to a camel. And when you put your lizard in the sun, w/ this outside, or just placing the cage next to a window? And is it that he goes comatose after you pour the water on him or before? It could be possible that the water is too cold? Unfortunately we need more information so please make a addition to your post|`|7ZsMMkp5aa	It depends what type of lizard. If it is nocturnal, then that is normal, but if not, it may be too cold of the lighting id changing it's sleeping pattern. For example, if you were not giving it enough light in the day or it is getting a lot of light during the night. Hope this helps. Good luck!                                         *__*

BjFat2raaa	A mouse in your house is not going to be cold. He's got a fur coat! I went outside a few mornings ago when it was -30f.. and I saw mice just hangning out outside in the snow. Your mouse is probably comfortable. If you're worried give him like 20 sheets of toilet paper.. shred it a little with your hands and your mouse will make a comfy bed out of the rest (my gerbils used to do this and my friends mice did too).|`|44kEtDvIaa	A small box and blanket where he can cuddle into should do the trick.|`|6Z29aDnjaa	You could get one of these.    http://www.drsfostersmith.com/product/pr...    I know that is a lot of money, but a electric blanket around the cage would work just as well. And if you don't have one of them you can get nesting bedding, and that would work just as well also.    This stuff is cheap, but works just as well.    http://www.drsfostersmith.com/product/pr...    If you need something for tonight tho, then try to find things like cloths, fleece, and stuff like that.    I hope this helps.|`|LGV9uiFLaa	LOL you just got the mouse and you are already trying to freeze him to death!HAHA This is a perfect example to do your research on a breed of animal before getting it.|`|agS7LsZEaa	Put him in a room that is on the highest level because heat rises and the highest room will have the most heat!|`|U01avfzxaa	i think you should fill up his/her cage filled with a tiny blanket and   its perfectly warm because that's all it needs, a tiny blanket &  your mouse's fur.
udLtA7T7aa	The result can be vicious cat fights, which,i f one of the cats is younger, smaller or more vulnerable can end up in a trip to the vets or worse! However, it doesn't have to be like this. By taking a few precautionary steps,you can keep hostilities to a minimum. It is only natural that there may be some initial hissing and growling, but you don't want any resentment to progress further than that. The key to success lies in the slow introduction of the new cat. Give them time to get to know one another.    Rub the cats down with the same towel to transfer their scents to each other, or make the cats smell similar by rubbing powder into their fur.    Put the new cat in a bathroom or bedroom for a few days away from the older cat. Feed the older cat by the door of the new kitty's room so that the two cats can smell each other and virtually eat side by side but with a door separating them!   Take some time to put the older cat into the new cat's room and allow the new arrival out to explore the rest of its new home in safety. This gives her a chance to find a hiding place if she wants and to learn the smell of the older cat. The older cat meanwhile will be becoming accustomed to the new cat's smell, too.    Then return the animals to their original places, leaving the door slightly open for a few hours so that the cats can see each other. Repeat this process over the next few days. This gentle, slow introduction should help prevent a face to face cat fight.    There may still be romps and occasional acts of aggression but by introducing them to each other slowly, they should learn to tolerate each other and cohabitat peacefully.|`|2ITN8Ximaa	Just separate them I have two cats who loves to go at it at times all I do is put one in another room for a while..|`|yAsLhdp2aa	try to use a squirt gun on them the moment the behavior is being displayed...cats hate water and generally it only takes 1 squirt for one to run off..it may take a couple weeks, but cats are smart..they will get the drift.

AA11887983	I would probably not use it.  The product has an expiration date for a reason.  Sometimes it just means that the product won't work, but you cannot know for sure, so giving it may just give you false security.  If your cats are not symptomatic for the worms, ask your vet if you can bring in a specimen of the worm for proper identification, and then get the appropriate dewormer.  If you have a good relationship with your vet, and the pets have been seen recently, you may be able to just pick up the medication.  If the cats have not been examined recently, or if you have not established a good relationship with the vet,  they legally are not supposed to just dispense medication without seeing the pet.  You can at least call them and find out.  And then find out what types of preventative measures you can take to reduce the chances that your cats with get the parasites again.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	I would not use it unless you've talked to your vet.|`|yAsLhdp2aa	If your cat is current on a general exam within the last 12 months...they can prescribe the medication without the exam needed.  After 12 months, it is against FDA law to perscibe. I would not use it, it probably wont do any harm, but the strength to kill the parasites is no longer there.  Drontal is more of a general dewormer for tapes an roundworms. Panacur is more a treatment for either coccidia or giardia (bacteria, not parasites). cant remember wich one though.    Also, if it is tapeworms you are deworming for (looks like rice) then they only come from digesting fleas..so make sure they are on monthy flea treatment (frontline or advantage..no OTC products) or they will just keep getting tapes.    good luck|`|NkoL23t6aa	I wouldn't take the chance if you love the cat.
4sDaBXAjaa	I bit with shanks is more harsh than a snaffle. Check to make sure the snaffle is in the mouth correctly. You may want to try a figure eight nose band to help keep his mouth closed.
5TCewPYRaa	Don't drug her up--that will affect your performance when you actually get into your run. Thats the stupidest suggestion--don't listen to that.      What you need to do, is find a quiet corner of the warm-up ring and get her listening to you--take her through her gait transitions, make her back-up, side-pass pivot to change directions--collect her, slow her down, let her extend---ask her to do things to make her have a "job" and listen to your demands instead of worrying about whats going on...    If she gets hyper in the holding pen waiting for the run, keep her out of there until you are "in the hole" (you have 2 runners ahead of you) and then go in and keep her moving around at a walk...as soon as you are done your run, get out of the ring and back to peace and quiet (or at least the most quiet spot on the grounds!)       Good Luck, and make sure you stay calm--your nerves will make her hyper--I like to chew gum while im waiting--its a great stress reliever---but you may want to spit it out before you run in case you swallow it....    BB      PS: My sisters barrel mare is exactly the same--its funny cuz shes completely calm outside the warm-up ring, but as soon as you walk into that gate, she is flinging her head and ansy--then after her run she is all calm and cool lol until the next event (if its a multi-event show..)..|`|bI7wMCJXaa	Make her pay attention to you. I assume you have some sort of warm ups. Give her stuff to think about so she needs to pay more attention to you than the other horses. She's obviously very herd oriented.    Kudos for not wanting to drug your horse. You can get into big trouble with USEF for that.|`|AA12048299	I'm guessing she lives as a lone horse at the property where she lives? If so, systematically expose her to more horses without the stress of the barrel competition.. take her on trails with friends you're very comfortable with, for example.     Aside from that, I'd look into cutting out carbohydrates from her diet. Talk to your vet about 'cool calories' that still provide energy, without the effect of making her hot, or in your words 'hyper'. Corn and some other grains need to be cut out, as well as molasses. You can look into beet pulp, rice bran & alfalfa as a basis for her diet. Use cocosoya oil if you need to supplement fat, or if she's a hard keeper.     Your mare also may benefit from a vitamin B calming supplement; I like Thia-Cal from Finish Line. I saw a difference in my guy in a week. Then again, shes' got to be deficient in order for you to see an improvment. Also consider having her tested for Selenium dificiency. If so, your vet can recommend good E/Selenium supplements that can help in the cases of tension.     (If she's selenium deficient, her muscles may be sore, which may make her more reactive to certain stimuli, like seeing unfamiliar horses)    Again, run all this by your vet to confirm, and especially before proceding with the selenium supplementation. Selenium 'overdose' or toxicity is a horrible disease that you dont' ever want to witness. B supplementation, on the other hand, is safer. If a horse ingests too much B, he simply eliminates it in his urine.    Best of luck to you|`|j2yLjm6Naa	I'm really into aromatherapies for horse and I would suggest LAVENDER it is good for calming horses down, check into more aroma therapies at aromatherapiesforhorses.com|`|at7LXbEfaa	So she gets 'hot' at new events im not ure if you have this term in western riding.

I know you can use some oils or supplements prolly but I have never done those|`|01j7Jx0Gaa	Every show we go to I bring a big box of hay for them to munch on while we are waiting. I let mine hang with me, not tied to trailer all day. Grazing seems to calm them some. We had a truly wonderful barrel horse who we loved dearly. He has  past on to the other side and is missed dearly. Take lots of pictures and video if you can. Good Luck!!!
bI7wMCJXaa	She looks pretty cute. Pictures aren't great tho.    Make sure you get a thorough vet check including trotting her out on a hard surface and X-rays especially if she ever raced.    I like her coloring. Be prepared for her to be green in summer (grass stains) and brown in spring and fall (mud and dirt)|`|AA11137816	She looks fabulous for starters, and her conformation looks great from the pictures i've seen. The only flaw in her conformation is that she has a very little trace of a u-neck but that's very minor! She is a great age and she will be great eventing I am assuming! Has she had any show experience? You might want to make sure she has good dressage scores, probably above at least 63% at the minimum. Make sure you try her out more than one time as I know of some people that rode crazy horses once, bought them only to find out they were drugged up and they ended up being nut balls! Haha, hopefully that won't happen to you so, good luck!|`|QpN1OJ2aaa	shes beautiful!!l sounds perfect|`|tZxVey2baa	She looks nice and just think you'll get better gas mileage.|`|S6I5kCuvaa	She is a very pretty horse that is for sure.

I would try to get a 30 day trial on her and during the 30 days, get a vet check.|`|rQ8nU3gxaa	She's gorgeous, and It's great that she jumps 4 feet easily. The horses I ride definitely can't do that. She's a good choice!|`|MnUKF5GBaa	She does look very nice, but the person who said vet check is totally correct-----include with the vet chek x rays of her legs and front feet especially!!!!!!  Also make sure that you go visit her at least once when they don't know you are coming-----if not possible make sure that you go two hours earlier than you said you would stop, then ask for a 30 day trial.  Good luck|`|TnY8goobaa	She is a nice horse alright.. she aint the kind of horse that i would pick in a bunch... but i think she'd to alright..|`|ivX7KIHvaa	her confirmation is pretty correct, but her hindquarters are slightly smaller than i like for jumpers, but if she can get over 4 foot its not really a problem, she is very nice and if she is a good price i would take her.
x6UJe8jkaa	Yes, George T. Hitler.|`|NkoL23t6aa	what do you mean?
lING8JbJaa	1. Snakes live off instinct, survival and health, so their minds are not capable of the thought to train them.    2. If snakes had this thought, they would still be much much less motivated than your average cat.    3. Training is typically based on food, praise, or toy rewards. Snakes eat only about once a week or more, couldn't care less about praise, and don't play with toys, so it's pretty much useless.    4. If they had the ability to be trained, what would you train them to do? I mean, they don't really have much to work with.|`|jxtNodu2aa	If your snake is willing to eat 'treats' (maybe small pieces of it's regular diet) than there is no reason they can't be trained, but snakes don't eat like that.  The biggest reason they aren't trainable is because: how do you reward a good thing as compared to not rewarding a non-trick thing?  There is no reward system with training snakes.|`|6j9EZXGWaa	Snakes live in the moment. They are wired for flight-or-fight responses. Some snakes can be conditioned based on this feature. Here is an example. When a captive snake becomes excited and is anticpating food all the time you open it's cage and all you want to do is just handle him, you can take that feeding moment away from the snake by handling it with a snake hook first and then guiding it into hand. The snake will soon begin to associate the hook with handling rather than the dinner bell in most cases depending on the species of snake that you are dealing with.|`|rrFbQZzIaa	most animals learn tricks due to a reward system and w/ snakes, there is no way to reward them. They only eat one large meal a week, unlike mammals.  Also b/c of their limited locomotion, there's very little they can be taught to do.|`|McnuekTBaa	They simply lack the cognitive ability to be trained.|`|7ZsMMkp5aa	I honestly don't have a clue. Go see an expert. Sorry I couldn't help.
9kceDOTraa	Those two species you have listed are herbivores actually.  Feeder fish are not really a good food source for anything outside of a strict predator anyways.  Spiralina flakes, cichlid pellets or crisps, and suppliment in bloodworms or brine shrimp once a week to round out the diet.    You also need to get them out of that 5 gallon tank you mentioned in your last question.  This is not a suitable tank to keep these species in, even more so if they turn out to be males.|`|8ZL2mLDeaa	Not the best idea. Stick with a variety of african cichlid foods. they are omnivores but eat mosty like a herbivore.|`|MeVmm0NEaa	Sorry I Am Legend, but a 5 gallon tank is not suitable for even one cichlid regardless of sex!  However, you are correct as to their diet.  Giving most types of Malawi cichlids feeder fish could result in a serious condition called Malawi Bloat that can easily be fatal.  Stick to store bought foods appropriate for these cichlids.
a0cec08ffbd6cf10f87ca2426641db05aa	I feed my cat a mixture of both. I would feel guilty feeding them dry food only. The way I look at it is that I wouldn't like to have to eat dry food all the time, so why should I make them. I know it's better for their teeth etc, but my two get a small portion of high quality wet food in the morning each and again in the evening. During the day and night they get to eat as much high quality dry food as they like. That way they get the best of both worlds.|`|V7JXXX3faa	I have 3 cats... they all eat dry food...

Even though it's not the best diet for your cat, it's much better than feeding something of low quality which in turn might lead to more vet expenses. And since the vet is pretty costly, in the long run, you probably would have saved money purchasing high quality dry food. It is more expensive but not nearly expensive as monthly costs of canned and/or raw. Mine averages about $50, more or less, for one cat on canned/raw. I'm about to adopt another cat so now I'll have to double that amount.|`|eX8i4vwRaa	i have kittens so i was told they need more nutrition.  so i usually mix it.|`|XzEGvaXjaa	Why would you feel guilty about it? There's nothing wrong with dry cat food as long as its of good quality. A lot of the best quality cat foods are dry. In fact...my cats refuse to eat anything but dry food...

All you have to do is make sure they have enough water too.|`|Uc96X3T3aa	You can get some soft food (5oz can)and mix it with water and it will go a long way.6 cats might require a little more though.

All of my cats are vet checked and vet told at normal weights.|`|ae2463081bceefeded7bc1d2928595baaa	It's okay if the moisture content they get overall is decent.

They can live just fine on dry food.|`|bb8h33w8aa	I only feed my kitty dried food.  It's just too expensive and messy to go to canned.  And they tend to get overweight with it too.  He's perfectly happy with just dry and is healthy too.    Don't feel guilty, as long as you're feeding them you're fine.  But you would have to ween them off of the canned by mixing canned with dry for a while.  Then start giving them more dry than canned until it's all dry food after a while.  In a months time you should have them used to the dry food.    ~Good Luck~|`|3ab0562924ae58daee1fe664ccc36a9daa	My family has fed our cats both, we usually only fed them dry cat food when they were not pregnant, but once they were pregnant we added canned cat food.   I believe its better for their teeth as well ( dried cat food)|`|4k5NJN29aa	The biggest issue people have with dry-only diets is moisture. Cats aren't fantastic about getting as much hydration as they need.    To counter this, I would suggest buying them a fountain ($15-60, depending on the brand and type). The constantly flowing water encourages hydration; my cats will sometimes sit and stare at their Petmate Fresh Flow and drink from it repeatedly. It's not as costly as wet food, and I've had mine for almost a year now with no troubles. I feed my cats both wet and dry food, but during the times when I had run out of the canned kind, they drank more to compensate.    At least make sure you're sticking to a quality brand... there's no replacing that. Never buy the grocery store kinds, they'll land you expensive trips to the vet later down the line. Look into Wellness Core or Evo by Innova.    (Edit: The two brands I recommended are grain-free. This means they are extremely low in carbs and give your kitties the nutrients they need, not fillers. They will be good for weight maintenance. Since they are of high quality, you will also need to feed less... making the bag last much longer. Another good quality brand that is considered the most economic is Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul.)|`|aPxmZq00aa	I have 6 and 2 just like to eat dried food, the important thing is is if they really drink a lot of water, I mean a lot like they go to the bowl 4 or 5 times a day, actually I have a fountain for mine and they really drink a lot.  I have also a 14 year old cat and he would only eat the cheap dry food, no wet food, he ended up with a blockage and had kidney failure, twice.  The vet told me I could feed him any kind of wet food but only the Purina UT dry food. So actually I only keep the UT food in the house, but my 14 yr old only eats wet food now. In my opinion it is really not good to feed cats a diet of all dry food, they will get kidney problems, unless they drink  huge amount of water. Wet food gives them a lot of water.|`|AQoby9NZaa	I do. Nothing wrong with it.|`|gKMQeSHSaa	Yes, it is fine.

Don't feel guilty.  I'm sure your kitties are more than happy with the food you are giving them.  But if you are unsure just give your vet a ring and ask them for advice on it.  I'm sure they'd be pleased to advise you.
MnNnMfaLaa	Well, do you know for certain that she would be okay with the pelts of these great pets becoming accessories?  If you don't know for sure, you'd better do some research.  To be absolutely honest with you, if I was in her situation, I'd love to have a photo collage or something like that of the beloved pets; not their pelts for mittens or a hat.    Another option is to cremate the remains and put them in a really pretty urn that she can keep on the mantle.  To find out who would do something like that, check with the local funeral homes and vet clinics.  They usually offer some kind of a service like that for a fee.    Above all, make sure you know if your wife will react well to any idea you go with here.  If they really do mean as much to her as you say, you'll need to tread carefully.|`|MZ8uqhNEaa	Um, maybe make a scarf or hat, but don't be surprised if your wife is a little freaked out.    WHy don't you get her a lovable kitten instead? I'm a girl (obviously) and even if I did love my cats dearly I'm not sure I would want them as a scarf or mittens. :)    It really is the thought that counts though. So maybe make those things, then buy her a new playful kitten. She might like that idea a bit better. But if she knew you asked this question, I bet she would smile. Because I don't think any man I know would do that for his wife. :) Amazing l?ve.    ??????????????????????????????????????...    The Anim?l L?ver|`|3ab0562924ae58daee1fe664ccc36a9daa	I actually just seen a show on this, of course some pet owners didn't think it was a great idea but there were some that really liked the idea, so i guess what i would do is ask your wife what she thinks about the idea first before you surprise her with it.   I believe the lady that had the idea to do this made a purse out of her pets fur.   As for me i would rather just have an urn with something engraved on it for memory like i did with my Rottweiler i had for 12 years.|`|LGV9uiFLaa	Lol omgod please tell me this is a joke!hahahah|`|UOZGLCfNaa	forget that get your wife another cat|`|Uib2Lmywaa	Not a good idea.|`|pDPSaL37aa	Whoa, I hope this is a joke. I highly doubt your wife would be happy if you hand over pieces of clothing made out of her beloved pets. If anything, have them cremated. I think she might like that.|`|XEeFbieTaa	a nice relaxing vacation, or a spa treatment|`|KfQKvToqaa	I would be really, really angry if my husband made a scarf out of my beloved pets. I would freak out.    I don't recommend you do that. But hey. Everyone's different. I don't know.|`|mT3S0lrGaa	No way! If my husband did this I would possibly leave him! the best present to get would be a new kitten for her.|`|4pDpAKHwaa	I'd recommend just getting her a new pet. A puppy or a kitten or a rabbit could do the trick.    You don't think she'd like her cats stuffed by a taxidermist.
udPENhCxaa	Your bird sounds depressed or lonely. Play some music or get her a mate. She might be moulting. Really don't know but never hurts to try.|`|UF2zGaRmaa	i have one and she might be sick,might be scared,she might be hurt,or she might be threatened.that's about all i would think.another thing make sure you care for her and give her love.|`|Mg8zk1n7aa	She is either sick or very lonely. You don't let her out of the cage? That could definitely be a reason she's depressed (if she is). She really, really needs to be let out of her cage daily. She also needs access to fresh foods, cuttlebone, and a mineral block (and water of course). You have a male? Why don't you put them together (assuming she isn't sick - be sure of that first)? You will see a huge change in her. Make sure there is not a box or similar surface for them in there though, it could be used a nesting box.    Good luck. Hope your budgie is 100% soon.|`|eLAkduCJaa	I think she is sick. Two of my parakeets got puffy before they died. I don't mean to alarm you or anything, but there could be something wrong with her, especially if she's not acting normal. I think in our case they died because of a disease, not because they didn't eat enough. I'm no expert though.|`|vbEkYH2haa	I answered your other topic too..  She sounds sick to me. Budgies dont get depressed like that.     What did your mom clean the cage with? Birds are VERY sensitive  to chemicals, incense, teflon and other household cleaners.    I hope she pulls though for you. She REALLY needs a vet
G0KKfXMUaa	Hay bales would be Ok, though poles are always best because if your horse taps them, they'll fall easily, and that's more safe. Here's a list of things you can use:    1. Hay bales  2. Large logs  3. barrels  4. tires      Depending on how high you plan to jump, you could set the poles you have on two chairs and create a vertical. Or you could use two poles to make a larger X (cross rail).    If you aren't satisfied with any of these options, you could consider buying used standards. Just get a cheap pair. Check online, or your local horse shop.    Good luck, and happy jumping =)|`|pnDZcQKpaa	hay bales are definetly safe, but your horse could get distracted and try to stop in front of it and try to take a nibble :)  if you don't have poles, you can just buy those plastic tubes and ace  hardware or anywhere. if you jump other objects though, such as barrels, make sure that your horse is comfortable with them and doesn't look at them funny. you could also buy attachments where you buy a wooden plank and then attach the attachment to it, so that you can put it onto jump cups, and they sell them at dover saddlery.  try building some standards if you know how; I'm pretty sure that it's just easier to order/buy them though.    hope i helped!|`|5TCewPYRaa	If you can dig a "trench" deep enough to submerge large tires 1/2 way into you can jump tires, you don't just want to stack them up, in case your horse doesn't "tuck" and gets a foot caught--yikes!     You can jump hay bales, barrels (you can cut them in half for shorter jumps..), large logs, we made some neat little 1 1/2 foot jumps with that plastic porch lattice and put "feet" on them with wood--they worked well and were really light and easy to move...    Um...you can try log benches--there is a campsite near us that has a dirt fire pit (no rocks or anything like that around it) and benches all around...it looks sort of like a "devils trap" or whatever its called...its fun to jump...      Basically anything that isn't too wide, or awkwardly shaped---you don't want to hurt yourself or your horse on weird objects like wheel barrows or tables... lol    Use common sense when selecting potential "jumps"|`|EghHVkHEaa	Haha i love jumping random objects! Just make sure your horse is ok with it too lol. I jump barrels, lawn chairs, wood objects, anything bascially, its funn. ;]|`|at7LXbEfaa	tires. barrels|`|bI7wMCJXaa	Have you seen some of the stuff eventers jump? Are you kidding me? Hay bales are definitely safe. Just make sure whatever you use isn't going to move on its own, ie, an empty plastic barrel that the wind can blow. That would be bad if it blew into your horse as he's ready to take a jump and even worse if it blew away from him.    Be creative, and this will definitely be helpful to despook him for the jumping arena.|`|8rVodF9vaa	hay bales are good. Milk crates would be ok. Just don't use anything that your horse could get tangled up in, like a chair or tire, or anything that could really hurt you if you fell on it.
5IcNNkkuaa	Louie is a black hooded Fancy.  Minnie is a tan hooded Fancy.  Dewie is a brown Fancy.  Honey is a cream.  Socks is a brown Fancy as well. [Berkshire style, which means white belly and color on top]    I can't see the ears on Honey that well, but if they are larger than the rest of your rats, she would be considered a Dumbo Rat. Fancy rats are your typical domesticated rats and can come in a VARIETY of colors.     Other colors are Agouti based colors (three thoned) include: agouti, amber, cinnamon, blue agouti, and fawn. Black based colours include black, blue, chocolate, mink, pearl, silver, and white. Himalayan and Siamese Rats also are color combinations, much like you would see on a cat with specific points.    Hope I helped. They are beautiful. :]|`|C3DSUacAaa	Louie might be a black hooded (head and shoulders with back stripe) or a bareback (head and shoulders only), but the faint stripe on the shoulders spoils either marking.    Minnie is a true hooded, with the stripe continuing down to the tail. Depending on her eye colour, she might be topaz coloured (dark eyes) or silverfawn (pink eyes).    Dewie's colour seems to be cinnamon; I can't see his belly, so his marking might be self (all the same colour), Irish (white triangle on chest), or berkshire (entire white belly).    Honey is a champagne coloured berkshire (I see white feet, so I'm assuming her belly is white too). If her belly is not white, then she's a self, slightly spoiled by the feet.    Socks is an agouti (or cinnamon? the colour in the picture might be a little off) berkshire.    Your rats are all gorgeous! I myself have had a berkshire agouti, a mink varieberk and a black hooded.|`|xQtnTKCAaa	im a new rat owner and i have a dumbo. they have big round ears but all of yours have pointed so im guessing that their all fancy rats|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	The answer(s) you received before seemed pretty good, what was wrong with it(/them)?|`|I6KKFwxXaa	Louie is definitely a hooded I have a black and white hooded female so that one I know for sure the others I would think are fancy but then my other 2 girls are hairless so those are the only breeds I know unless dumbo which have larger ears and blues and bluish silver in color. Here are two sites that might help you figure out what type they are they have pictures and are not just a description|`|nmzpdvkqaa	there the type you feed to a snake|`|GTNnHgSPaa	Louie is a black hood, only instead of the classic hood has variegation.      Minnie is either a beige or a fawn hood.  If she has an orangish/bright kind of tone to her, and light ticking in her color, she's a fawn.  Otherwise, if it's all one color (every strand of hair is the same) she's a beige.    Socks is a black berk.    Dewie is an agouti. If he has a white belly, he is also a berkshire.    Honey is beige.  If she has a white belly, she's a berk.    They're all adorable!|`|6W4ZWOetaa	Your rats are so cute!!  I have nine rats myself. I also do rescues and breed (I have two litters coming soon!!)    I know you're still taking answers... so here's some more fun info.  All pet rats are known as "fancy rats" Fancy rats have either dumbo or standard ears, tails or no tails, some are hairless, and some can even be dwarf!  They are all, however, the same species; "Rattus Norvegicus."  An Agouti rat (brown) looks most closely like it's wild cousins...  I have an Agouti rat too!    Anyhoo,     Louie is a black hooded rat; almost what you would call a bareback except that he's got a teensy bit of a stripe there    Minnie is a fawn hooded    Dewie is an Agouti self.    Honey is a Beige Berkshire (I didn't see the white feet until I looked closer...different from fawn as in it's a little lighter; not champagne because technically champagne rats have red eyes)    Socks is a Black Berkshire.  Berkshires have "mittens" or... well, socks (I used to have an agouti berkshire named Socks, and I have a black berkie right now named Bruce) they also have white tummies and white tips on their tails.     have fun with your ratties!!!|`|X1LlP5KPaa	Now you have some good answers, but I just want to say this to the first person that answered.  YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE ONE RAT.  DO SOME RESEARCH BEFORE YOU SUBJECT AN ANIMAL TO YOU IGNORANCE.  And by the way, all pet rats are fancy rats.  Your lonely dumbo is a type of fancy rat.  Fancy is just a generic term for pet rats, if the ears are pointed then they are standard-eared.|`|IFvj22PDaa	They are all so cute!! They are all hooded rats, not sure what color though sorry          >.
w4DIPHf1aa	Good question..might have saved you alot of money..    Aqua clear filters are the way to go.    fully customizable and low cost to run.    comes with all the media...    Just use the sponge, throw out the carbon and buy another kit of bio-max to plop on top of the one it comes with.    your good to go, just rinse in aquarium water when needed and replace every 2-3 years. Just never replace both bags of bio-max at the same time. At least 6 months apart    very few filters offer this low cost approach..      http://www.jlaquatics.com/phpstore/store...        good luck!!
e9gXZsKxaa	That is not a suitable tank for breeding. You'll need a 10 gallon tank with shallow water, a floating foam cup for the bubblenest and an almond leaf, turn up the temperature to 82 degrees.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Please say that you don't expect them to breed in that.    You should have a 5-10 gallon spawning tank, and a larger tank for fry grow out.    Please read this- http://www.flippersandfins.net/bettabree...|`|SKkb4xNiaa	they may want a bigger place if you get a 10 gallon aquarium put the male first and if you see that he is doing some bubbles put her inside. if you put them in a little aquarium the babies may not grow the way they are supposed to grow thats why i recoment you to get a bigger tank. I think they're more than prepared good luck E|`|ENQkQ6JKaa	Cool tank     They will kill eachother ..  not a very good idea.....
XI2iylR4aa	http://www.paulfrank.com/    All the cute monkeys you can handle!|`|u1HahCoqaa	What are you asking? Although either way, you are displaying a certain lack of intelligence.      There is no cheap website to buy exotic, highly intelligent animals on. Luckily for you, you can just look in the mirror. Although I cannot gaurentee the "cute" part. But the intelligence level should be similar.    And do you mean the pic by your name? Hello, did you ever try typing that question into that handy little search bar that says "Search for questions" ? Its been asked before. You can easily find it, if you actually wanted to try.       Shoo. Only ask if you have REAL questions.|`|wdvUNvz6aa	wait real monkeys? fake? glass? china? porcelin? you need to be more specific
3n60UxgQaa	To live means to require water in their cells.  So yes, they get thirsty. =]|`|45Cbtd7raa	they drink the water they piss and poop in|`|R5xeWy0Naa	only for beer|`|4d2XO03Uaa	Not often, seeing as they sort of live in water.|`|wX9BHWGpaa	WHAT!?!??! OK! First, fish I guess do get thirsty but for oxegen in the water, but fish do not get thirsty for water?|`|PlBHhU3Kaa	fishes get thirsty, thats why water reduces in aquarium after few days.
4pDpAKHwaa	I don't know if there is any way to change it. As they grow older, they might just want to fight for your affection. Make sure to treat them equally.     My two cats were best friends and would play together, but as they grew older, they just became more calm and relaxed. They don't hate each other, but they don't spend extra time together.    I'd just assume it's a part of growing up.|`|tfuUIec0aa	Just think of them as people. We go through stages of liking people.  Maybe they are just going through a stage. Try pettingthem at the same time together. You can't make them be friends, just give them the love htey need and hopefully them can begin to love eachother again.       Best of luck :)
4d2XO03Uaa	Rhasboras need to have a minimum water temperature of about 76-78 degrees farenheit. goldfish, however, only need room temperature water (about 68-70 degrees) putting a Rahsbora in with the goldfish would probably quickly kill it.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Goldfish are coldwater fish and should only be kept with other coldwater fish.    The rasbora is a tropical fish and requires a heater to maintain the water temperature between 77F-82F.     They should not be mixed.|`|8ZL2mLDeaa	If everything about the water is the same, i don't see why not. Since he is a little "retarded", hess pobibly just as lw as the goldfish and they will pobibly ignore eachother. I had a messed up tiger barb, he was a lot blacker than the others, swam really slow and look drunk when doing it. But i would keep him in the tank with his own kind, even if hes not swining with the rest, hell still feel more comfortable there.|`|c46BrSe7aa	Awwww Poor Fish. I would buy him his own 10 gallon tank to live in.
6yoCcGBWaa	Green water is caused by algae blooms.  Snails will eat some of the algae that grows on the sides of the tank and on the gravel, but won't do a thing for the algae in the water.    Algae needs nitrogen and light.  Even water that tests in the perfect range for nitrates, can still grow algae.  Try keeping your tank light on for only 8 hours a day.    There's no need to totally eliminate the algae, just gain control of it.    Start with small, but frequent water changes, like 10% (1 gallon) of water every single day until your water no longer looks green.  Once you've got it clear, change 10% every 2 or 3 days.  You can continue decreasing the frequency of changes until you find the right timing for your tank.|`|45Cbtd7raa	is ur filter good?|`|FpRJY5QCaa	Well maybe your snails are dead! That happened to me once. I had 3 snails and the water kept turning green and the guy at petco said if the snails are dead they don't do their job. So maybe you should check and see if they have died.
y0cbLn0Yaa	Well, my Kelpie, nearly 7, has been a great dog.  He is independant so there are no problems with him fretting when left home alone during the day.  He does not bark all the time - only if there is something around.  People walk their dogs past our property and he does not bark at them but he will go up to the fence to meet them.    He is easily trained and likes to please but, having owned Border Collies and Belgian Shepherds, his focus is not completely on me, the handler when doing Obedience.  He does all the commands but he doesn't walk along staring at me.    He likes to be inside with the family, but he also likes to be outside doing what he considers to be his job.  Watching for 4 wheel drives to go past the property, particularly ones with dogs on the back and then chasing them along the fenceline.    I wouldn't trust him off lead near a road as he would more than likely chase cars if he got half a chance.    When he was a young dog he would herd my kids at times.  This didn't bother them though as they were old enough to deal with it.    I probably wouldn't have a Kelpie if I didn't have a big yard (we have 5 acres) and if I wasn't prepared to spend time with it training, etc; but then I would say that about most breeds.|`|udLtA7T7aa	well they bark a lot and it get annoying because there bark is so high pitched  Yorkshire Terrier are much better|`|IJ2QhfKEaa	they ase okay but require aaaaaalot of aattention and excersise and abig yard. they are designed to be working dogs on farms so they are really active. i probly wouldnt do it cuz there are that many types of dogs out there that wouldnt be such a hassle|`|KJZojiHJaa	Well, they are a herding dog so chances are she is going to have a lot of energy!!! You need to make sure that you guys are ready to completely commit to her exercise needs or she will not be a good pet because she will be hyper and trying to find ways to expel her excess energy. Good Luck!|`|lhOd2hvXaa	Kelpies are very, very, very energetic dogs.  Most breeders I know won't even place a Kelpie in a home where it won't be actively working (herding).    Make sure you do your homework before deciding to make one a pet.    Good Luck!
bb60640c96610ff5b7eb5df5251f191caa	Training takes time and patience, there are no shortcuts to a well trained dog.     You can find videos, books and articles here http://www.clickertraining.com|`|AA11171398	Every dog is different. What is your specific problem?

AA11171398	Morning- let out of crate to go straight out to potty.  If he doesn't potty, put him back in for 10 minutes max and then let him straight back out.  Once he goes, feed him breakfast and put him back in his crate.  1 hour later let him straight out to potty.  Nothing, back in for 10 minutes.  Go for a 30 minute walk and then he can come into the house for play time.  (the playtime in the house is used as a reward)  Every hour during playtime, let him out where he is to potty.  Right before going back into the crate, potty time.  Let him sleep.  Wake up- out to potty.  Nothing, back in for 10 minutes.  Come back in to eat lunch.  Wait 1 hr, then out to potty.  Nothing, comes in for 10.  Playtime/exercise walk  Potty walk every hour during play.  Back in for dinner.  Take away water for the night after eating.  Wait 1 hr, then out to potty.  A bit more play time before bed.  Last time out to potty should be as late as possible.     It is a lot but trust me if you stay to it you will see results in 7-14 days...more then likely sooner.|`|ToeeUGZUaa	During the days, take your dog outside every hour so if he has to go to the bathroom, he will go. And right before you go in to go to bed, take your dog to go poop.|`|FPI5IBYXaa	crate train!!|`|HRvPoQzKaa	Put papers down if you haven't.    Take the dog out every hour just to be safe. When he pee or poop, pick up your dog and put him next to the accident and say, "No. Bad boy" in a firm tone. It may take a while fo the dog to get used to it.|`|VwmaWcp9aa	You might find some suggestions on the sites listed below.
7igxiGrAaa	Aquarium filters and Aquarium heaters are not needed for tanks less than 5 gallons and actually should be avoided.    The gravel in your tank should provide adequate biological filtration in this setup. Everything should be fine as long as you change the water frequently and remove excess food and debris immediately.    For a tank smaller than a gallon, change 100% of the water once a day or at least 3x/week. For a larger tank, do partial water changes of 25% of water a week. Be sure to siphon or vacuum your gravel when you change your water.    Because the betta fish breathes at the surface of the water, the water does not need to be aerated either. In fact, aeration and circulation may create too much flow for your betta, who are not accustomed to having to swim very hard.    If you do buy a heater for your aquarium, invest in a thermometer as well. Monitor the temperature of the water carefully, as extreme or fluctuating temperatures can kill your betta fish.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Is there another betta on the other side?  What size tank?    Bettas are tropical fish and their temperature should be between 77F-82F.    ~You could have added a detail onto your last question.|`|6ZiIw4ugaa	I'm afraid you have a mentally retarded fish.|`|Kkxq4Tisaa	Its not possible to measure. Or at least with our tools today.    You can measure someones memory compared to someone who has really good memory, but a third person opinion is not available with our technology.    The brain holds many secrets and passageways that we as people have yet to understand, or even discover for that matter.    Memory is something extraordinary. Its like consciousness. We cannot pin point exactly where consciousness is held in the brain. We know its in the frontal cortex, and that memory is in the occipital lobe, but we cannot pin point the exact location, and therefore, cannot properly measure it.|`|WNB4Vojsaa	i have been concerned about this. please tell us more.|`|CPJ9jDfgaa	is it a beta on the other side?

It was sort of funny, but I kind of didn't always want to know when she "did her thing" and I wondered if she didn't want us to know, either.  She would often speed off to another part of the house and I was certain her expression said, "I did not just do something unladylike!"
5TM9P8tsaa	*The cavy will eat the mouse. Sorry. Must have two separate cages. And if by some small chance you try to risk it, the food is very different and the cavy would get sick by eating the mouse food, and I am not talking about the fruits and vegetables. They both can eat those. But the cavy needs a strict diet to maintain health.|`|4SQx8smEaa	If you mean living in the same cage then NO, the piggy will eat the mouse.|`|BpQn6wMiaa	if they are in separate cages yu wont have any problems but don't let them loose together
28WJwHf4aa	Yes, you can add another male, granted your current guinea pig is a male (no babies). You should make sure the cage has plenty of running space though to accomadate the growing guinea pigs. You should have more than one hiding spot, even though they will most likely enjoy each other's company and cuddle together.|`|bEQn0Vrtaa	the running balls are actually dangerous or guinea pigs. it is a toy that is manufactured to make money with no thought given to the animal. their back is so frail and the way they fit in the ball they can be injured very easily. as for an igloo they love to cuddle if you buy two you will find they will use only one of them anyway so do not waste the money.|`|L8ff8x1Eaa	ok have 3 guinea pig so i know quit a bit about them. ok first of all it is a really bad idea to put two male gunnie pigs together, because they can fight and  the can get seriously hurt. i have never done this but this is what the pet guinea pig books say.  also as for the running balls none of my pigs got how to do it ! they just sat there in the ball. also they really did not seam to like being in it. i advise you not to buy them. but you do what you want. what is better than a ball though is those minnie gates. they love to run around in those and they cant get out.  i have those for mine. the igloos are always good i have one of those for each oh my pigs. they really like the privacy. ok hope this helps. oh and i so do think you should get another pig just get a different cage for it. GUINEA PIGS RULE!!!!!!|`|F2QtzNyXaa	oh yeah def. only 1 more though.|`|9N56lFMaaa	Yes, your pig would probably very much enjoy having a companion. Another male pig should be OK as long as there are no female pigs in the household. I would try to find one about the same age as your current pig.  I have 2 males that are housed together that get along wonderfully and love to play. One igloo should be enough, usually they will cuddle together in the same house (and they'll have more space to run around with only one igloo in their enclosure). Exercise balls are dangerous to guinea pigs (their backs do not bend like a hamster or gerbil) and they can become injured easily in one.
28WJwHf4aa	1.5 flakes per fish should be fine. Just have him do a tiny pinch.     Don't use weekend feeders. They can throw off your tank's cycle.|`|5knGTf5paa	there are things you can buy that you put at the bottom of the tank and every so often it releases a little bit of flakes to float up to the top of the tank and that could feed them. they have some that last for a week up to like 3 weeks|`|e9gXZsKxaa	Feed once a day, whatever it can eat in 2-3 minutes, do not overfeed. Remove all uneaten food so it does not foul the water.|`|TEfbDURuaa	just a little tiny pinch for both. if they are literally that size, i think youre good with what youre doing now. (;|`|AA11799177	3 flakes per fish is fine  Observe your fish to see that all of them get something to eat. Some fish will rush to the food, others will take a little longer to feed.

hJ1MmQAIaa	hun, why would you get a new fish after your cat ate your old one knowing it could do it again?  okay well if you have a small fishtank try to use like plastic wrap like pull it across the bowl but dont forget to cut holes in it.   if you dont have plastic wrap you could try foil. (:  hope this helped, and im sorry about your door, i think i would die without mine. ):|`|9Ff4Bms7aa	If it's a Betta, do you have a higher place to put it at? like, move the betta to a desk at night, and make sure that there are no chair or "steps" the cat can jump to to reach your betta. Or, you can move the betta to a nearby washroom or something, any table or place your cat cannot reach.|`|AA11708471	Bettas do need 5+ gallon heated and filtered aquariums    They also need lids on their tanks because bettas will jump and cats can get them|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Betta fish require a bare minimum of 2.5 gallons (bigger is better), filtration and a heater. They are tropical fish and their temperature needs to be maintained between 77F-82F. Cooler temperatures will cause a decrease in activity, a lowered immune system, and make them susceptible to disease. An aquarium would also give the fish the security of having a hood.     ~Just because Betta's can breath air from the surface does not mean that they should be subjected to living in tiny bowls of stagnant water with next to no swimming space.     Don't be rude.|`|5knGTf5paa	kill the cat..|`|zEES49hhaa	Well, I'm guessing you have a bowl.  So, you can not put a top on it and you should have a tank for filtration, heat, and protection purposes.  But...........since you don't and there is nowhere to relocate the fishbowl try setting plastic mats with double-stick tape all around your fishbowl to deter the cats from coming close. If this doesnt work, the Scat Mat probably will (available online and at many pet stores, gives off a slight electrical shock). Or perhaps your mom will allow you to lock the cat in another room while your not home.    The easiest thing to do is to buy an aquarium set at Walmart (under $50.00 around here)  GOOD LUCK      ADDITION ~  Don't expect people to help you if you are going to resort to juvenile name calling...........and yes, Betta should have tanks.  They are tropical and need a warmer climate, and all fish require good water quality.  It's not your fault that you were misinformed however, a lot of people think bowls are okay because that is how the fish is marketed.  If you want your Betta to be happy and live a long fulfilling life a bowl is not the life for your Betta.  Please see the sites below to get accurate Information on Betta's (from people that actually care about fish, not from someone that just wants to sell them)|`|1e6e1a106474f7febf542c71a7f47818aa	I have a Beta display on my kitchen counter, they good.    I hate cats, but if you must have one, close the fish in a cabinet at night.    Or put the cat outside.|`|igpMQn0kaa	You're not only rude, but you're just what you're calling us.    Bettas DO need tanks--2.5g to be exact--with heaters and filters. It's true that they can live without all of it, but they definitely won't thrive.    Now, little girl, go tell your mummy and daddy to go research proper pet care since you're obviously not responsible enough to do it yourself.|`|cm87ujQ1aa	put something over the bowl ! but not fully as some air needs to get in. Maybe a book or something weighed down....or next time u see ur cat hanging around there squrt it with water until it learns not to go near!
Ey1Mb4FAaa	Your mother is right in some ways, Disgusting is a point of view so your mother is right there because it her point of view. And rodent being unless can be turn too. If you don't play with them and love them than there are unless because they don't show you love because you have not show them any.     But Rodents can be great pets, I breed gerbils and know how much fun they can be and love they can show. The best thing to do is to try and change your mothers view disgusting if see believe they are than you do have hope of great one by just showing her research. The best thing to do is show her other with rodents as pets, keep showing her picture and bring her to pet shops, try and change what see things about rodents look if cool facts and slowly she will change her mind. but you have to keep work on it and don't give up! everyday something new a fact or a picture, or going to the pet shop to look at rodents.    that is really your only Hope and i wish you the best    O and rabbits are Rodents yes! they part of the rodent family|`|Spycl8Ikaa	Research about rabbits and tell her interesting facts about them. tell her that they are not useless but kind sweet animals! i have one too.|`|qp7ssYJcaa	Bunnies aren't rodents.

kggedGcXaa	From your pictures your fish looks fine. As for the colors of your fish I believe its changing color because the fish is maturing. Sometimes when fish mature they lose some of there pretty colors, you could try feeding your goldfish some color enhancing flake food or pellets. Other then that your fish looks nice and healthy. Let me know how things go.    Kim|`|yV8fog7Paa	I absolutly love the pictures!! :D they are so, pretty!!|`|e9gXZsKxaa	Nothing to worry about, the goldfish looks normal.|`|28WJwHf4aa	He's perfectly fine!

I had 2 fantails and unfortunately, they died.|`|yjZKNvXcaa	your fish is not turning brown, it's turning gold! the light-colored parts are actually turning gold then eventually red, depending on the diet and tank condiions. the face and back appear to be turning darker only because the rest of the body is turning lighter colored. before longm the light colored parts will become golden!!!! this is a normal occurence for some goldfish although others might turn red right from the start, specially the red and white ones

3IUMh4Igaa	It really depends in the type of scorpion you are being STUNG by. I was stung by a large emperor scorpion and the sting hurt, but then it was nothing. I was also stung by an inch long florida bark scorpion and it was horrible. The sting wasn't that bad, but after it felt like my hand was on fire.   A general rule is, the venom is worse on your smaller species with smaller claws. Larger species that have large claws, (they can defend themselves) have less potent venom.|`|5IcNNkkuaa	You mean stung?|`|6j9EZXGWaa	I have been stung and it hurts at first. A wasp sting hurts a bit more and for a longer period of time though.|`|SYrJiDKwaa	Feels like a bee sting.|`|7ZsMMkp5aa	Don't know want it is like but I know that if it has big claws your lucky.

nOlwYnunaa	Some birds really are just a one person bird.  We have 12 macaws here (and many other types of birds) and while most of them are well socialized, there are two who only like one person in the family.  All but two of the macaws came to us untamed and pretty aggressive.  With one of our birds we tried something pretty drastic because he was so terrified of every human.  We only fed him by hand.....from a spoon at first.. a big long one lol.....then by hand.  Took a while but he's much calmer around people now and seems to be actually enjoying being a bird again.   Generally we let the bird decide though.  We have birds who were pretty badly neglected and if they feel comfortable with just one of us, we pretty much let them be.  One of our birds hates bald men....he was almost killed by one.... Kitogirl's suggestion of having your dad give him his favorite treat is a good one, perhaps you can have only your dad give him that treat for a while?|`|c5anDswjaa	Oh I have a green cheeked conure who is the same way, Neon.. But its towards my mom.. The reason mine is like that is because he is bonded to ME.. And when Im gone my dad is the one that will feed him and talk to him, so Neon doesnt hate him as much as he hates my mom haha..|`|7HEZhx46aa	Some birds become one-person birds and/or display an "unexplained" aggression toward one person or even one TYPE of person -- some birds don't like men, some birds don't like women, some birds don't like people with long hair or people who wear glasses --  one of my caiques hates my cousin and will go for her jugular at every opportunity, even though she's never done anything at all to the bird -- in fact, the bird bit her within the first 15 minutes of meeting her.    There's very little you can do to change their attitude -- birds have individual personalities like people do, and some of them are also as stubborn as mules. All you can do is be careful when your bird is around that person or vice versa.|`|Mg8zk1n7aa	Your parrot has bonded strongly to you (can I ask what kind of bird he is?). He is being territorial about you and probably dislikes it when you pay attention to others or they come close to/touch you.     If you want him to become more of a family bird, try getting your dad and other members of your fam to give him his favourite treats and spend more time with him (preferably when you're not in the room). When they are more friendly, your dad/someone could take him into an unfamiliar room and your bird will learn to rely on him more because he is what is familiar...just some ideas :)    Hope that helped.|`|K0H7bAR8aa	He came to this earth from mars to destroy your father.....jk idk?|`|OQM5rkF5aa	Were you the first owner. With all pets if you were not the first owner of them than maybe the previous owner surrounded your bird with males who were mean to him, He doesn't know who your father is he thinks he was the gut who was mean to him.   Also let them get to know each other. Have your father sit next to the cage and talk to him put his y around the cage to get them both used to each other.  Maybe your dad is afraid of him and your bird senses that and like a dog wants to know why.

qqUvoC5uaa	Beagles are very known for their "reverse sneezes". Although what they are doing really has nothing to do with sneezing, (just sounds like it).    It is not dangerous, and generally speaking the dog isn't in pain. A way to help "stop" the episode of reverse sneezes would be to stroke your dogs throat which will induce swallowing.|`|BmFjxbqAaa	When the dogs do this just go to them and pet them and say it is going to be alright and just keep talking to them and patting them it might clam them down and they just might stop.

Sometimes, it almost sounds like he's going to throw up.  But the vet said this is normal. They are clearing their airways.|`|qYa9drX5aa	this isnt an aswer, so much as an empathy email.  My dogs do that too every now and then. I know exactly what you are talking about. I know its def not a beagle thing, because my cocker spaniel does it and my mixed girl (corgi/shiba inu). I can't even tell why, because they have done it randomly while just standing there, and after a lot of excess play and running around..  But they are fine as well.. it passes, and then they are back to being crazy dogs.   Id be curious to find out as well what the hell that is. :)|`|nPrfhGQ2aa	It depends, has it always done it or is it something that just started? Because the same thing happened to my boxer, he started like choking and it kind of sounded like there was something stuck in his throat and he was gagging on it. If it just started it could be something called "Kennel Cough." I think they get it from being around other dogs, and my sister just got a new dog so my dog caught it from him. I would suggest getting it checked out by a vet if it's new, and they're both doing it.Especially if you've had them around other dogs. Hope this helped. =]|`|7adb1ec924a232bd76f142d1a8a85b1baa	I have a basset-beagle mix. She does the same thing. Kinda sounds like she is snoring, but it is a reverse sneeze. I asked the vet about it, I was worried. lol|`|JsBb732Maa	Dogs have a backwards sneeze, could be that.|`|AA11887983	If the dog has episodes where he seems to be sucking air in through his nose, puffing out his cheeks and making a snorting sound, it may be something called a reverse sneeze.  it is exactly what it sounds like, but it is not dangerous.  Many people actually confuse it with asthma.  It is not serious, but more a sign of nasal irritation. Because beagles are constantly sniffing things, they may be more prone to irritation from things that they are exposed to.  If it is a problem, your vet can prescribe an anti-histamine that can help.|`|A5ZWt9cJaa	I know my grandmothers dog did the same thing. I think it has to do with either nerves, exitement or maybe a respitory thing in their lungs, or something like that. When my grandma's dog does it we have to get close to their face and tell him its okay and gently massage his throat. At least thats what the vet told us to do. Try it...Idk
28WJwHf4aa	Yes, you should ideally only have 1" of fish per gallon of water.     Most pet stores will take healthy fish as drop-offs. You may want to consider this.|`|1e6e1a106474f7febf542c71a7f47818aa	Why so many snails, they keep multiplying, you will be flushing.    The amount of fish is fine.

4aAhEK9daa	If you want more kittens go adopt some from a shelter.  Breeding your cat IS very irresponsible when over TWELVE MILLION cats and dogs are put to death at shelters every year because there's just not enough homes for them.  And "just let her get out" to get pregnant?  Give me a freaking break.  Sure - then you can end up with Feline Leukemia positive kittens - even better!    If you allow your cat to breed then however many kittens you have will be that many more PUT TO DEATH at your local shelter since those kittens will take homes away from them.    Get your cat spayed and fi you truly don't have a clue about the pet overpopulation problem then go volunteer some time at your local shelter.|`|OjXvYEZDaa	I agree with those people above. Please just get ur cat fixed, I am going to get my cat fixed next week. I am thinking about others cats who needed good home from shelters. You shouldn't think about yourself to make money to breeding ur cat think about other poor cats who lives in shelter begging " please take me good home" prevent from putting them to sleep due no room to keep in shelter. Please go and see the local shelter to see it for yourself, then you will know what we are talking about " get cat fixed" poor kitten in shelter..|`|RN1wGlWWaa	The "proper" way is for the cat to be a purebred show quality cat that has been shown and you have tested her for genetic problems in the breed.  And she is about 10-12 months old.  And the male should have all of the same too.    Mixed breed cats should be spayed.  There is NO reason to allow her to have even one litter.  Kittens as young as 4 months can breed and if she goes in and out of heat a lot, she can have complications (pyrometria, cancers).    If you love your kitten, take her in now and get her spayed.  If you want to adopt a kitten to keep her company, then go to the shelter.      Additional - I would only adopt mixed breeds from a shelter - not pay for them from someone who's cat had kittens.  I only pay for purebred cats that I plan on showing!|`|4k5NJN29aa	You should really just get her spayed and become a foster mom for already pregnant cats, or for litters of kittens. You can do this by applying through a local shelter for your specific state.    If you breed your kitten, you will be contributing to the over-population of pets... millions of cats of all ages, even kittens by the box fulls, have to be put down each year because there just aren't enough homes. Even if you find a home for all of your kittens, you will be taking away homes from those trying to find them in shelters.    Your cat's chance of getting mammary cancer will decrease with a spay, as well as numerous other health risks. Some cats also develop terrible personalities after giving birth and will refuse their kittens. There's no way of telling what kind of "mom" your kitten will be.    Please refer to the following sites:    http://www.hart90.org/GeneralInformation...  http://www.sniksnak.com/benefits.html    EDIT: In response to your added details, who do you think is going to give you money for kittens they can get at a shelter for low costs that are already spayed/neutered and UTD on shots?     Just go ADOPT 2-3 kittens, who will grow into 2-3 CATS by the way, and stop being irresponsible.    Edit  2: People are calling you irresponsible because you are going to create additional kittens without caring AT ALL that homeless kittens will have to die for it. All so you can try to make money.|`|K0uTjeWiaa	You want to breed her? You may sell? You want to do it properly?     have you zero regard for life?

Do you know kittens are being killed by the thousands these days cause there is no   room anywhere for them even in kill shelters?

If she is a pure bred, then perhaps. But there are too many unwanted kitties in the shelters and they have to be put to sleep because there are not enough homes for them.  Would it be fair to breed her and then decide that you don't want them? This is a tough question to ask yourself. Would you be able to find homes for the kittens? There are so many things to think about and plan if this is what you really want.  If she has any medical problems, would that pass to her offspring?    I'm just giving you something to think about....|`|85gJHDbNaa	Why do you want to breed your kitten?  If it's because cute wittle kittens making more cute wittle kittens is oh-so adorable, please don't. If you breed your cats, and sell them or give them away to people that want cats, then you're just stealing homes from those numerous unwanted cats in the shelter. Kittens are cute and all, but there are too many animals being put down because they're not as tiny and cute as they were a few years back.|`|jvHIqtp2aa	I am sorry but the proper thing to do is have your kitten spayed. There are literally thousands of cats euthanized every day. Don't add to the problem, if you want another cat, go to the shelter. I worked as a vet tech at an animal shelter for two years. One day alone we had to euthanize over 100 cats and kittens due to disease and lack of space. No one wanted to adopt these cats. I myself ended up rescuing 8 cats and 7 dogs and one horse and a chicken. There aren't enough homes for the cats and kittens already here. If you want to experience the whole birth thing, there are plenty of abandoned pregnant cats at shelters. Believe me.|`|4SQx8smEaa	Take a long hard look at the animal shelter, those animals need homes or they will be put to sleep, by bringing kittens in the world all you are really doing is taking the chances of finding a loving home  away from a kitten in the shelter. And will be put to sleep.  Do not breed and add to the numbers of then abandoned homeless animals. please consider getting you kitten spayed, and if you want another kitten go to your local animal shelter and adopt one, I am sure that you will find one in there that you will fall in love with.      ADD: Sell?? Do you actually think that you can sell a cat? People do not just purchase cats from people especially when they can rescue one that has all its shots and is fixed from a shelter. Or go to a pet shop and purchase one for 40 dollars with all its shots, and they even can get them for free (that is from people like you breeding then or just letting their cat run free)  No one is going to purchase a cat off of you that is not health checked by a vet, and up to date on all of its shots and has been dewormed.|`|mgVrAqpkaa	your cat should be spayed- younger is actually worse- get educated and grow up. too many unwanted cats that starve or are abused. jeez are you that superficial and shallow.

OjeL1if4aa	Unless it says "Do NOT Wash" Then yes, you can wash it.    We have a large washing machine so I just wash it at home with 1/3 cup of detergent. I wash in cold water with extra rinse cycle to be sure all the soap is out. Then, depending on the weather I either dry it in the dryer or hang it.     ETA: If you dont' have a large washing machine it's best to either send it off to be cleaned or go to the local laundromat and do it there. If your machine isn't big enough it won't wash the blanket properly and leave dirty and soapy spots... which can irritate the horse.    If I'm drying it in the middle of the winter... like my horse is going to need it again at the end of the day... I'll use the dryer... at the end of the blanket season though I hang dry it before storage. It usually sits out for a couple of days to be sure it's 100% dry so it doesn't collect moisture or anything while in storage.|`|pnDZcQKpaa	yes. if you couldn't wash a blanket, that would be a rip off!  if you live somewhere where it's sunny and warm, then just hang your blanket on a fence or somewhere it can lie strait, and take a horse and spray it all over. then, spray water-proof spray on it so it doesn't get soaked if your horse rolls around in a puddle.    if you want it really washed, like with detergent, then your local tack shop can probably wash your blanket for you.     hope i helped!|`|j2yLjm6Naa	I quite often just hose off my blankets, but often if they need repaiing i take them to the dry cleaners an they do it for me but this can cost up to $30.00|`|5i8lDbXfaa	I would hose it off with some soap (something not too harsh) and a stiff brush. Make sure all the soap comes out, it could irritate the horses skin.    When you put your blankets up after the winter season, you should wash it in a large front loading washing machine.  This way when you store it it will be really clean for the next cold season.  After is it washed let it hang dry outside.     Always check the blanket everyday when using it.  Check for rubbing and such.  My horse loves to roll in his, so you can imagine how many times I'm cleaning mine. LOL|`|vfhKkiSKaa	Sure you can wash it.  You can even throw it in the dryer and dry it!  I just take mine to the local laundromat, throw them in the washer with some detergent and then throw them in the dryer.  I would not use super hot if you are worried about the blanket shrinking (although I have never had one do that on me).    What you should do after (which I don't and I should).  Is spray the blanket with scotch guard to help keep it waterproof.    You can also just rinse it off with a hose, but I think they get much cleaner if you machine wash them.

L8ff8x1Eaa	ok i have 3  guinea pigs so i have some experiences. so if he is hard to get a hold of to pick up and put back. try and make him comfortable just so that he stays in one place, for example pet of stroke him gently or lay a huge carrot out for him  to eat. the main thing you want is for him to be still. then when you think or know he is happy and staying there. GRAB HIM! not  like harshly but so you have a good hold! if he scratches WERE LONG SLEEVES OR GLOVES!   or if he trys to get away and run, pull him into your chest  and try to stroke him. this way he will feel more secure,and not like he is going to fall out of your arms.i have one guinea pig who is really hard to get in and out of her cage and this is what  i do and believe me it WORKS! i really hope this helps good luck with your furry friend!|`|LNnRSLdtaa	sneak up on him  get a carry case on the floor and hel likely walk inside it     i usually have to corner them|`|bEQn0Vrtaa	It sounds like you are her companion and she just wants to be with you, i worked that out by adjusting the cage so it opened up onto my bed and she could come and go as she wished, potty training was a breeze so i did not have to deal with poops on the bed or wet spots, she was just happy to be able to run and run all day if she felt.I have to admit i became quite fond of her sleeping on my feet!!|`|BpQn6wMiaa	You could try putting a towel over her, this should make her easier to catch so you can Simply place her back in her cage|`|xowm9t3kaa	My guinea pig used to jump into her cage when i held her and got near it she would just jump in I would just pick up your guinea pig and put them in their cage.
FkVMOTZtaa	You should really read up on B.A.R.F(bones and raw food) seems your dog would really  like this diet more plus its better for them since they are carnivores after all. Studies find dogs that eat raw are healthier than commercially fed.|`|ITnQEUQTaa	Smart dog!!   Millions of dogs and cats (including mine) go their entire lives never eating commercial pet foods.  In our house 'pet food' means raw meat, meaty bones and organs NOT highly processed crap in a bag full of artificial additives and poor quality, species inappropriate ingredients.    We feed two dogs, and three cats for much less that the cost of 'premium' foods.  They are in fantastic health, with no sign of periodontal disease (unlike more than 80% of commercially fed pets) and are well muscled with no extra fat.    Itchy skin and yeasty ears are classic signs of food intolerances.

Rx7wv4JLaa	I don't believe this is true..i train dogs of all sizes and all sizes get along just the same. It depends on the personality.

ErSbeRlzaa	K well basically you should have two different colour filters in there.  Two black ones which is a carbon filter which take out all the impurities and chemical thus making your water crystal clear- Should change every 6 - 8 weeks Or they will start degrading and releasing chemicals which are nt so good for your fish you can get them at most aquatic shops or on ebay for cheaper.  And two white ones which are filter media and should be changed every 5 - 6months and washed out every month (with aquarium water)  When cleaning either colour, remove the filter sponges and rinse them out with the water that youve just taken out of the tank, If you wash it with tap water then you loose all the beneficial bacteria you had in them.  No keep it at 25-26 degrees as they are tropical fish the need warm water which you probably already know, 25-26 in the average for most tropical fish.

kaqDUsI7aa	We haul our horses in stock trailers all the time--as long as they're not stepping all over each other they're perfectly fine. A lot of people don't like them because they don't have a separation between the horses, but if you have horses that get along that shouldn't be a problem.     We bought a corn pro stock trailer (looks like this: http://www.metzlerauto.com/TrailerPics/6... ) and my dad (who is an iron worker) installed a tack room in the front and a divider to make it into a two horse slant load. We found that it was a lot cheaper to do that than to buy a slant load trailer (it cost us less than $100, and a slant load trailer would have cost us over $1000 more).      Also, do take into consideration the horse's height. We had our trailer custom made to 7' tall instead of the normal 6'. We also had them put a rubber guard on the back so the horses wouldn't hurt themselves loading or unloading. Most companies will allow you to make these changes for a small fee.|`|DmUG33axaa	stock trailers are not bad, i have had horses forever and for a long time that is all we used. they are great for big horses, we have drafts, thats the only trailers they will fit in, unless you want to special order one. throw some rubber mats down and go for it, they usually don't have a lot of rubber padding because they are used for basic livestock, we have never had any trouble. even in a padded room a horse will find something to hurt itself on if it wants to.|`|PnkaUOlmaa	i have used stock trailers before with my show horses. they are just like any other you just have to get a good one, not one that is ancient or falling apart. i read the comments people have left for this question adn i would never use horsetopia.com or equinehits.com mostly everything that is on there is a scam, don't waist your time!

Many of my friends have them.  However....you should take the height into consideration. Many stock (cattle) trailers are only 6' or 6.5 feet tall and most horse trailers start at 7' tall.  Also many Stock (cattle) trailers are open all the way down and a stock/horse trailer only has open spaces at the top 1.5 to 2' of the outside walls.  Also, stock/cattle trailers don't usually have a tack compartment and are open all the way from front to back but stock/horse trailers do and usually have a slanted wall at the front allowing for slant loading of horses.   I wouldn't put my horse in a stock/cattle trailer that is only 6' tall and open all the way down, however I have no qualms about hauling my horse in a stock/horse trailer.  Another thing...most stock/horse trailers don't have dividers so if you are hauling multiple horses they'd better like each other.

86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	Presuming you mean Red Bellied Piranhas yes? There are many species but Red Bellies are the most common.    They need enormous tanks, I would say 250-300 gallons at least for 4 or so. These are big fish hitting around 12" and do find comfort in numbers. They are fairly sedentary except for when being fed. The tank also needs to have very good filtration as they are exceptionally messy when they're feeding.    This is the Piranha tank at London Zoo:  http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=FILqDol5yI...  It's about 8ft long, 3-4ft deep and 3-4ft tall.  That's an ideal tank for Piranha (and they're being fed worms there).    I don't think these fish should be readily available to the general public.

y7H1V39Jaa	Jillian86 is absolutely right.  Wait a while and weigh the pros and cons.  Poor ground manners is a pretty big con.  You didn't say how old this horse was, but he should have been taught those as a colt, there must be some reason why he wasn't, did you mention it or ask them why?  I would just outright ask them why or how he could ride so well and have such poor ground manners.  When you said poor ground manners, exactly what did you mean?  Lots of horses move pretty, it doesn't mean that they would be a good horse for you.  Are the sellers horse people? Do you think that they even know the difference?  Did they say why they were selling him?  Oh, sorry...to answer your question, if you buy him and are successful in teaching him good ground manners, it will do nothing but make him bond more.    EDIT*****It depends on the age of the horse, sometimes ground manners are NOT easy to fix.|`|MLC97M1Baa	This is a huge decision. Have you tried out any other horses and compared?

If this is the first horse that you are buying, you are overexcited, and you should REALLY listen to your trainer.     The ground manners are easy to fix, just let him know who is boss and make a few new rules that he will learn to follow. I have a mare, when I first got her She pawed (which she still does every now and then), threw her head around, rubbed on people to the point of knocking them over, stepped on feet (she didn't understand personal space), and even bit a few times. After a while of working with her, she has gotten much, much better.   You have to be very firm, but not abusive. Many people call any slapping abuse. I think that's ridiculous. Look at their size! What they do to each other in the pasture! If you don't use a little force now and then you are going to get hurt. As soon as you get him (assuming you do) You need to fix the problem.     Good Luck!  -Nov|`|wYBU1B1qaa	Sounds like everyone has counseled you on thinking about it to be sure so I'll address the questions you asked, with respecting you and your space there are basic things you can do just to get respect established.  If you want to go deeper into training, go for it.  As for specifics, everyone on here could give you directions, but it would be much for effective watching trainers such as john lyons, clint anderson or julie goodnight or working with your trainer to get basic respect started.  Working on getting it right from the get go would be perfect.  Getting a basic dvd or book would not be expensive and would definately be cheaper than damage caused to you from an overcrowding horse.  You asked if it would hurt your bond...training him to respect you will make your bond a lot stronger!!  If you go for it, good luck!|`|BkJ7pxQZaa	Working on ground manners is a wonderful way to build a bond with your horse. I find that people who do a lot of groundwork have better relationships with their horses and I have started to do  a lot of it and my horse and I are working out our saddle issues faster and with less frustration as well.|`|iynxbd9Daa	the horse sounds good... if you do buy it just let it settle down for a few days before you start to teach it some manners (which is quite easy)  you could ask for a trial|`|AA11675726	Sounds like you have two good answers - they both have the right idea - and about bonding with him - when you start teaching him his ground manners, the bonding will be there.  Especially if really spend time with him.  I wouldn't let that be an obstacle to getting the horse that you think will be great.  Sleeping on the idea is great - and spend time in prayer.  The Lord knows which horse is the right one for you.|`|a297uH97aa	I would definately sleep on it for a bit, heavily weigh the pros and cons of the horse perhaps go see him another time without the trainer so you can gauge your OWN opinions of the horse.  Perhaps discuss a trial period with the owners prior to purchasing him say 2 weeks or so as in that time you will have a pretty good idea if things will work out or not.  Manners are typically pretty simple to overcome just time and patience, Good luck!
d4ed95bed4c328fffaf810f911eaa905aa	sure, but you are looking at one big tank.   you could have an oscar, and a few jacks , or a whole S.A. community if you have a tank 250 or more.     also remember, you are looking at one massive FILTER, as all of these fish, but especially the oscar are DIRTY!!!|`|ZsoGZYqSaa	You need a big tank around 80-100 gal but if you get convicts they breed a lot and they will kill all the other fish in the tank|`|a2cjwMKcaa	Only if you have a lot of tank space. It also depends on the temperment of the individual Oscars, some are pretty relaxed about tankmates, other more territorial. But the bigger the tank, the less problems you will have.    As a single adult Oscar really needs 75gal by itself, then you really need to be bigger than that to even try tankmates.    Ian|`|hFyodb4Daa	Yes but you would need a pretty large tank of about 80-100 gallons
KHipZhWoaa	that's normal both of my german Sheppard's do that same thing with the stomach and also every dog i have seen eat for that matter so don't worry your dog is normal

Keep your dog on a leash if she is prone to running off and yes, dog's get fixated - you can stop them by controlling them on a leash.|`|JKKR67M9aa	Hey seems astho your pup is still pretty young. our cattle dogs are just crazy they are always hyper and jumping around like mad animals lol. I would suggest some puppy training.|`|2VSOCg4Qaa	I like the personality of a australian cattle dog. They are so sweet.
pvabglXhaa	I would get a tank about 45cm x 20cm for just a few fish.    The size will depend on whether you want to put in any rocks or plants and maybe add to the quantity of fish in the future.  The pet store where you buy all this will definately be able to recommend a good size tank and all the stuff you need.    You could get a good package deal on a tank, air stone and filter for around $100.  You may need a light above the tank too if you have it in a really dark place.    The accessories are really just the fish food, some extra media for the filter that you need to change regularly, a little fish net, an internal tank glass cleaner and maybe a new air stone once in a while.    Fish are very inexpensive to keep unless you really upgrade to something large but fish keeping does get addictive.    Best of luck!|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Tank size dictates what fish you may keep. So decide what is within your price range and buy fish accordingly. Please thoroughly research the fish you have chosen.     Algae eater is too broad. There are literally hundreds to choose from. Which type did you have in mind? The common pleco can grow two feet and requires 55 gallons, and the rubber lip can grow 5 inches.    A twenty gallon set up will cost about $130.|`|FhzRbgFuaa	I think you should get a 30 gallon tank, a heater, a filter and the tank should cost about 44 dollars it depends on what store you are buying your tank from but here is a website that somebody gave me it might help you it's www.drsfostersmith.com hope this helps!  By the way if your looking for female guppies they have some in petsmart in grocery stores they dont have females only male guppies and petsmart has ALOT of fish)|`|FDm4y0TWaa	i think you'd be good for a 10 gallon  you can get them at walmart now for 45$ and this includes a filter and a hood with a light!  you also need substrate (gravel), a net, and a plant for them to hide in  your probably looking at 15-20$ in fish  so overall this will cost you a maximum of 75$ for everything|`|Y2VdU4Pyaa	i bought mine for 10$ for small fishes... but they are so many :c|`|pM4YogW5aa	You should be able to get a kit from your local pet franchise.  I bought a 10 gallon kit a few months back for $50 from one of the national pet store chains.  The kit contained a heater, filter, hood, and light.  You'll need rocks (approx. $10), decor which can cost as low as $5 for each item or can get very pricey.  You may also want to get an air pump, hose, and air stones for about $15 (total) for the bubble effect, and to oxygenate the water.  It'll run animated air fixtures too.  Of course you also have to buy fish, which go for about 2 or 3 dollars each for the type of fish you want.    All told, you're looking about $100 new.    Alternatively, you can check the used sites.  I recently purchased a 35 gallon hexagon tank fully loaded with two fish for $150.  I see the basic square tanks going for $50 or so with everything included.    Good Luck!
W02kTOqmaa	I don't see why ONLY pit bull owners can answer. All dogs need certain nutritional need, with certain supplements that are good for certain breeds.    While I am not a pit owner, I know the breed well.    You need to start out with a good basic diet. AVOID any foods that contain corn (a cheap filler that dogs can not digest), wheat (a cheap filler that is the leading cause of dog allergies to food), or by-products (ANY part of an animals body except for feathers can be considered a by-product).    You want meat to be the first ingredient, preferably followed by another meat or meat-meal. Make sure the meat is named. You don't want poultry, or meat. You want chicken, or beef. You don't want fish, you want ocean whitefish, or another type of fish.    As long as you follow those simple rules, you will have a pretty good quality food.    I'm not sure where you live, but I'm going to assume in America. Blue Buffalo is the highest quality food that is readily available. All PetSmart's sell it, so it is easy to find. There are other premium foods, such as Evo, Canidae, Taste of the Wild, and Diamond, but they can be harder to find. I've noticed a lot of feed stores sell Evo.    You want to avoid ANYTHING commercial, such as beneful, purina, pedigree, royal canin, alpo, puppy chow, eukanuba, science diet. If you notice, ALL of these contain corn and wheat. Why feed your dog something if it can't even digest half of what's in the food? Beneful claims it is a great food, but there are big pictures of wheat and corn on the bag. And the first ingredient is corn. The main ingredient in the food, your dog can't even digest. On a premium quality diet, your puppy will eat less but still gain the same amount of nutrients.    For pits, what to feed them can be iffy. Well bred pits should only be around 40lbs, breed standard. But they are being bred larger and larger, so its not uncommon to see a 75-100lb pit bull. If the parents were larger pits, feed a large breed puppy food, and switch over to adult food around 8-9 months. That way, your puppy won't grow too fast. The slower a large breed dog grows, the better. If the parents were smaller pits, then you are fine on any type of food.     Glucosamine can be supplemented to your dogs food when she's bigger (around 18-24 months) if she is a larger pit, to help her joints and hips, although pits aren't known to have major join problems. If you live in a dryer climate, salmon oil (wild caught is the best) is GREAT to use in their food. It moisturizes their skin and makes their coat softer and shinier. My shepherd gets bad dandruff, and salmon oil in his food really helps out.    Good luck with your girl! I know Im not a pit owner, but I know dog nutrition, and my sister has owned them for years      BTW, if you decide to go raw, that is an EXCELLENT diet! Notice the person that said don't feed raw also recomended a low quality food. But with raw, avoid cooking the meats. Cooking meat actually takes away some of the nutrients it contains            EDIT: A well prepared raw diet is the best, as it matches EXACTLY what the dogs digestive system is meant to digest, raw meat. Unfortunatly for some, if you live in a larger city or don't have a local butcher, it can be hard to find meat for a decent price. I've looked, but that is one of the only reasons I DON'T fee a raw diet.    If you can't feed raw, a premium dry kibble is your best. It's really up to you what kibble you want to feed. Blue Buffalo isn't the BEST, but it is one of the best, and it is the one that is the most available out there, simply because PetSmart carries it. Evo, Diamond, Taste of the Wild, Canidae, whatever premium food you feed is up to you (and that is usually determined by what is most readily available). Just as  I said,  make sure no corn or wheat or by-products, and meat preferably as the first TWO ingredients. If you follow those 4 easy rules, you'll have yourself a decent food|`|lyocWukKaa	When discussing types of food for your dog it is not generally breed specific.  Any high quality food with the least amount of bone meal and by products will work.  So unless there are specific problems with the dog (like skin problems, weight, or age) there is not any "Pit Bull" dog food.  If you find anything that says that it is they are just a rip off.|`|4Sf8hgy3aa	I feed my pits blue buffalo, and they LOVE it! Here's the website, it says more for itself than I could:::    http://www.bluebuff.com/    EDIT:::  CN17, pick up a book and shut your mouth. You're obviously much too ignorant to be in this forum.    Also, do NOT feed science diet or anything that can be bought at a grocery store, please! They have cheap fillers and ingredients that dogs can't digest.|`|9f5985366e1c1ff46ce53256d1a9c626aa	Well I dont own one (yet anyway LOL) but I do know that lamb and rice works best for them and raw meat is to avoided at all costs. It can make them mean. and yes, you can cook her meals if you like.  Best brand of dog food is Science Diet. Expensive though. Enjoy your new baby.|`|BYoVsKY4aa	I feed my 2 APBTs a raw diet with suppliments. I purchase a raw base online at the website below in the sources, which I then add my own meats and other suppliments to.  I believe a raw diet is the absolute best kind of diet you can give your dog, as it is the most natural. I give vanilla yogurt, eggs (with shells for calcium), cottage cheese, veggies, and some fruits as well as raw bones (chicken or beef). I also add in chicken livers, hearts, necks, all the gizzards I can find. Turkey necks are great as well.   I give Omega 3 Fatty Acid which I purchase from my local vet (closer than the nearest Petsmart), and I give Creatine powder made by AniMed for extra protein, as my two are pups. One is male and 8 months old, the other is female and almost 3 months old.|`|cvNN6l9Daa	I am a vet, which makes me a better source for answering questions like this than someone that simply owns a pit bull (plus 3 courses on nutrition both prior to and during vet school).  Raw meat, though unlikely to cause your pit to become mean, might harbor bad bacteria both for your dog and for you.  Royal Canin makes breed specific foods, so you might try that.  However, if you want to go the grocery store route, Iams kibble as a base (start off with large breed puppy food to help with joint heath) then start adult food around 1 year.  At that point, I like adding in about 2500 IU of fish oil supplements, probiotics, and some steamed veggies.  You can also add in cooked meats.  However, when adding in food to the kibble, you will have to decrease the kibble to make sure the calorie intake is not too high.|`|G16pUmpCaa	I have a 2 month old pit and i brought her in to petco when i was buying more food for her and i was buying her pedigree... and i literally got yelled at for feeding her that type of food! the lady that works there told me to feed her lots and lots of protein... she recomended i feed her lamb and rice NATURE'S RECIPE... my pit LOVES it! and i can see the shine in her coat and she's getting muscular! :)|`|0w1kwVFYaa	All dogs need a balanced diet. I personally buy the premium dry dog food and make their own wet food. The canned food is apparently 90% water.    For the dog food I use chicken and beef mince, oats, rice, vegetables e.g. carrots, potatoes, pumpkin. I blend the vegetables so it's like a soup then mix it in with the rest of the ingredients. Sometimes I add eggs in there if I'm using more beef mince than chicken.

H06PtiIAaa	which is why if you researched you would know that anemones dont even do that well under PC lighting which is the cheapest, T5 and MH are recommended for anemones.    It isnt really wattage, while that matters it about the kelvins.    10000K and blue actinic lighting is common and good under power compacts which is about 60-135 dollars.      RESEARCH|`|hKXIeur6aa	That won't work.   You will need to spend money on metal halide lighting, or return the anemone.|`|QrjjiOgTaa	your anenome is dying. you need a bigger tank and a compact flouescant bulb its around $400 dollars. did you bother picking up a book about anenomes before buying one? did you not realize that salt water tanks are expensive?? return the anenome or buy the compact flourescant bulb. case closed.|`|f71bc553ce48de0d47d00ce15fd871aaaa	what exactly is your sg, also your nitrates and phosphates?    and yes if its just lighting a 120 watt daylight bulb would look like crap but it would work, it will be producing heat like crazy and may over heat you water so make sure you have a fan ready just in case, but in truth if you can afford the proper equipment you shouldnt be in the salt water hobby yet,|`|5c5e9767db0aa6f5bac57f3e406b4092aa	you really should have researched what sorts of light anemones need before you purchased it.  like most people have already said, you need a pretty expensive fluorescent one.  i would buck up and buy the light if youre planning on keeping the anemone.    as for right now, your anemone might decide to move since it isnt doing well.  try putting a rock or something in front of the filter so it doesnt suck up the anemone if it starts to wander.  try to make it so that it blocks access but also is able to keep filtering water.
G032Flc3aa	One of our cats came to us as a kitten from a horrible place where we had to pay for him to be able to get him away, when we got him to the vet he had fleas, worms and a heart murmur, he'd been fed on cheese on toast.  As he was with us over the months and was well fed and cared for, each time we took him for his injections and then every few months the vet would have a listen to his heart, each time it sounded better. He is going to be 8 this year and the vet saw him this morning for his booster and said his heart is fine, a very slight murmur but not a problem at all.  Also my next door neighbour has a persian cat of 12 years old who has had a heart murmur all of his life, he too is absolutely fine.   Don't worry, I'm certain your cat will be absolutely fine and suffer no problems with the heart murmur.|`|4TX26viFaa	Humans have almost 200 different murmurs associated with hearts, and animals have almost as many.

o93EwErKaa	The eyes "looking funny" is not a good sign.  Do they look wrinkled and lack shine?  If so, it might be just that he is dehydrated and I would force feed Pedialyte with a syringe or encourage fluid consumption by taking a low sodium chicken broth and diluting it in half with water if he will drink that.    I would talk to your doctor about doing a blood panel for liver function.  Are the whites of the eyes or gums yellowed?  Is the urine a darker color?    http://www.helium.com/items/1118937-diag...|`|T8OFsBUUaa	Well, it's not a twisted stomach, because he wouldn't be eating or pooping if it was. Could be an allergy to something in his food if it has been switched lately. so, when he doesn't eat for a day or two, it clears out, then he is hungry again, eats it and gets sick. And I don't think it has anything to do with sniffing pee if your other dog is healthy.|`|JVvnET59aa	He needs to be taken to the vet..this could be something simple like a worm infestation to something more complex like a neurological disorder! Never let your dog go more than 36 hours without eating or drinking much...he is probably dehydrated. Give him pedialyte unflavored. and most importantly get him to the vet asap....
CSWlD8Vjaa	Well if your dog's leg is broken and it dosen't get to the vet to get fixed then it could result in very bad consequenses (leg grows back straight, dog is in pain, ect.)    Basically, there's no clear answer becuase it depends on a lot of other things but usually it's around 6-8 weeks then it could be a while after that for the dog to be back to normal. Also, after the cast is on the dog needs a lot of rest and needs to have almost no ectivity those first few weeks.    I'm not a vet so probably the best source of info would be to talk to a vet in your area.    PLEASE take your dog to the vet if he/she is not walking straight, can't walk on the leg, is whining constantly on it. It may be costly but at least your dog would be getting help =)    Good Luck

Rx7wv4JLaa	No it is one of the worst.     Dogs are omnivores and need a high fiber diet not a high protein diet.     Ol'roy also has a lot of fillers and corn. Corn speeds up the digestive system causing your dog to want to eat more. Corn is also hard for dogs to digest. It also has by products.     Some good quality foods are    wellness  Blue buffalo  Blue seal  Natural choice  Kirkland  Solid gold  Technical    All of these products do not have by products, fillers, or corn.      For going to the washroom, you want your dog to poop less. If they poop more it means they are not absorbing the nutrients in the food. A dog who poops less is getting the most out of its food and is absorbing the nutrients.|`|h6t4aRUOaa	Are you sure it's Ol'Roy. That costs $24.00 at Walmart for a 50 pound bag. It's all fillers that's why the dog poops so much. Believe it or not Costco's Kirkland is a good food. Blue Buffalo is one the best out there.|`|AA10112346	Nope.The worst you can buy. your vet is on drugs dude. or gets money for lying. the better the food the less stool.|`|qqUvoC5uaa	Vets generally know absolutely NOTHING about dog nutrition.     Your vet is likely another money driven person who is being paid by the Ol' Roy dog food company to tell everyone that their *terrible* food is the best.     Your dog is excreting wastes more frequently because he is not absorbing anything from the dog food. This makes it digest more quickly and therefore more poop more frequently.    Dogs are opportunistic carnivores (they cannot digest the filler crap such as corn, but will eat it if the situation arises), and if you look at the ingredients list on ol roy dog food, there is hardly any meat at all. And what there is is garbage "meat meal" which is essentially the crap that's been scraped off the floor.|`|CtYqMs5Paa	No, it's the worst dog food available!  More poop equals poorer quality food...the more poop is because more of the food is just passing through not being used.  You need to research dog foods badly and learn how to read lables.  And if your vet is telling you it's a good food, you need a new vet too.    http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com|`|P2yRAWiJaa	Ol Roy is one of the worst you can buy and your vet shouldn't be selling it in his office as it's a "Wal Mart" brand.  If you are buying it for $34 you are getting ripped off since you can get the same size bag for $18 at Wal-Mart.  Ol Roy has no meat content and is probably the worse food you can get (unless you go to a grocery store and get something called "Dog Food" as the brand).    Bring the food back to your vet. Tell him you want a refund and that he lied to you so you'll be going to another vet.  If he doesn't know about proper feeding and nutrition then how is he going to make good decisions about your dog???  Once you are done with him you need to go to Petsmart and buy one of these brands -- Blue Buffalo, Royal Canin or Nutro.  They are all higher quality dog foods, with good ingredients and nutritional values.  Your dog will eat less, digest more, and poop less.|`|5rvjjaVlaa	ummmmmmm you need a new vet,you can get a 44.1 pound bag at walmart for 16.50 and also they just had a big recall on it due to salmonella. i have several dogs that eat it and now they are all sick.i am changing foods imediately.i think you should so the same with the food and your vet.|`|GTNnHgSPaa	Of course it's not.  Frankly, I would be really .. not inclined to use a vet who thought of Ol Roy as a good food.    Dogs poop more if there is more filler in the food.  Quality foods they poop less because they use more of the food.    http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/|`|GIs08ClNaa	I know that Ol' Roy isnt the best food available. It is carried by major store chains. It is pretty cheap for a 40 pound bag. The reason that you dog is pooping more is that it is a lover quality food and has more fillers in it. More filler = more poop.|`|cv1lTP7haa	Is this a joke? Pooping more means more waste. That's bad.    We tried Ol' Roy once in a moment of desperation and found chicken bone slivers in the canned food. NOT a good company. At ALL.|`|V5ZpqRs8aa	I have never tried that brand but it must be at least desent if your vet recommends it.

K6lGQqTFaa	Just a guess here but I think your horse may have a cold and ringworm.  When I got my foal he had a bad cold and his immune system couldn't shake it for a few weeks.  In that time he caught ringworm because of the weakened immunity.  The ringworm markings are round and usually about an inch in diameter.  The hair falls off and they weep a bit which causes a scab.  You have to clean them and disinfect the area.  Ringworm is very contagious so you shouldn't share brushes (wash them with disinfectant after), share tack with other horses or have any contact yourself with other horses before washing your hands.  I heard people can catch it from horses too so use gloves if possible.      You should really have a vet look at it.  I did my own diagnosis of the ringworms on the internet as I didn't have a good vet at the time.  Google ringworm in horses.  Maybe that's it?  As for the cold, my foal couldn't shake his so I had to have the vet give him an immunity shot, that cleared it up in a couple of days.    Good luck, I hope he's feeling better soon.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	His eye discharge and runny nose are both signs of plugged tear ducts, which the vet can irrigate. They also may be infected. The lesions on his hind sound like they are long linear lesions?  But you say they are spreading down the legs?  I'm posting an article on identifying skin lumps and lesions.  It may help you to narrow down the possibilities as far as what these lesions are.    http://www.equisearch.com/horses_care/he...
OA7cPgGNaa	Yes, they are fairly easy as long as someone can look at your dog and say "Yeah, that is 100% border collie" (or even 80%). If someone can look at your dog and not even give one answer as to what type of breed it is mixed with, you won't get in.    I have competed in agility for 15+ years with all breeds, especially border collies. I have 5 right now. Two of them are ones I purchased from one of the best breeders for competing purposes. The other three are rescues as I have my own rescue group. I got an PAL/ILP number for all of those. My first two rescues got through without a problem, but my last one is a PB (believe it or not) Tri smooth coat and she got denied the first time. I resent in my application a few days later using the same info and the same pictures and we got accepted.    Tip: Depending on the desk your application lands on decides if you will pass or not. If you get denied, try again! Sometimes it takes 2 or 3 tries to get it! I know this is a pain in the rear since its $35 each time, but 9/10 you will get through with some persistence.    If you need anymore info, feel free to contact me at callmedaisy07@yahoo.com.|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	you wouldn't be able to get a AKC number, since you don't have a 5 to 7 gen pedigree on the dog. You would have to prove in every way that the dog is purebred, you might be able to get an ILP/PAL if the photo is good enough... as you are right they are generally interested only in money. As long as you send a copy of a vet record on the spay and neuter your are basically in... I have seen alot of mixes get into AKC agility competes this way.|`|BYoVsKY4aa	An ILP is a great way to compete with a dog that, for whatever reason, cannot be registered. Typically, these dogs are rescues that greatly resemble a main breed. I have owned a purebred female Border Collie that I rescued, and she was registered through AKC with the ILP so I could compete in agility and obedience. The only issue some people have is the requirement that the dog be spayed/neutered. However, if the dog is not pedigreed, there really is no reason to breed unless the dog is a new breed.|`|RFfTjnxzaa	Below is a link about acquiring an ILP/PAL number.    They will require two recent and clear color photos of the dog. They also require proof that the dog has been spayed/neutered.    The link provides more details.

(i think she might need help lol)    one of my other cats was sleeping on my Jack Russell's favorite stuffed duck so he was acting all sneaky and went up to the cat (who had one eye open watching him) and he looked away from her direction and then used his front leg to try to pull it away from her.  it was really funny.|`|5UPL5Rdoaa	my male puggle kingston was outside and we have a owl thing that we use to scare birds away and he all of a sudden he saw it and did a double take and starting barking at it he is such a dork|`|jK4ZBX0naa	i have a new kitty and at night she crawls up by the end of my bed and sneaks to about the middle and then she'll pounce on my face and scramble away before i can even react.|`|bgDMY8I2aa	My chubby little female yorkie actually climbed onto the hearth of my fireplace and buried her chew bone in the ashes in order to keep my lil' male yorkie from getting it.

D1beU6MPaa	Obviously it is infected. He needs to be seen by the vet ASAP. He may have gotten something in his eye, but it sounds very painful for him. The vet can give you meds to clear it up. You will not be able to do it by yourself. Please get him to the vet today. I know I would not want to wait if I were in that kind of pain. Good luck|`|MGAmNxddaa	Try warm compresses on his eye before you try to open it.If it is still like this tomorrow,get him to the vet.
6qsocyK3aa	More than most people think when you think of potential vet bills (can be in the thousands) including worming/flea treatmet, vaccinations and and spaying/neatering; bedding; food; bowls; leads/collars; toys; training aids; books you may buy; combs/brushes; fees for puppy training classes if you choose to enrol in those.|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	Presuming you are getting or are hoping to get a new puppy, you'll need the following to raise, train, and feed the puppy properly:  1.  Food dish and water dish.  These need to be 'large enough' to hold one day's food, and one day's water (depends on the size of the adult dog, not on his puppy size when you get him).  You may use dishes from what you have on hand if you don't want to pay any money for them, if you want to buy good puppy/dog dishes, they range in price from about $4-12 per bowl.  2. Newspaper ... you'll need a lot of newspaper while your puppy is being 'potty trained' but you can ask neighbors or friends to 'contribute' their used newspaper.  You do not need 'puppy pads' from any store.  Cost: if you regularly read the paper or get them from friends: $0.00.  If you must buy newspapers to be used just for the puppy, you'll need to spend about $100 over time during the 'training period.'  3. Collar and leash:  This depends on the size of your puppy, how fast the puppy will grow, and what kind you buy.  Generally, the collar will cost about $5-15, and I'd get a good 'fabric-plastic' colloar for a new puppy, which is much less expensive than leather.  Same for the leash, but BE SURE that the leash is 6' long for 'training purposes ...   4. Choke chain.  Again, you'll need to know the size of your puppy.  You want a collar to 'fit' properly, so you'll be getting several of these as the small puppy grows to an adult dog ... at least 6 in the first 12 months.  Each choke chain (just a chain, no 'studs' to poke the puppy's neck) should cost between $3-12.  5. Bed for the puppy.  You may want to use old blankets at first, since puppies 'leak' and get their beds dirty.  Cost at first: $0.00.  By the time your puppy is grown and 'trained' to do his business outside, you may want to 'move up' to a real 'dog bed.'  Most places sell these for $20 or less (look for 'sales').  6. Toys for puppy.  Again, you can spend a ton of money on 'dog toys' or you may spend very little and use things that you 'have around the house' at first.  Old towels are the best toys ... put a knot in both ends and you pull on one end while your puppy pulls on the other.  NEVER give a puppy or dog 'old shoes' ... the pet will think any shoe is then a toy, and that gets really expensive, really fast, but for your feet (or friend's and family's feet, not for the puppy/dog.  Get a good Frisbee (depending on size of puppy ... these are less expensive purchased in the early fall on 'clearance' and get at least 4 at first.  Cost is about $2 at most per Frisbee.  7. Food.  If you love your puppy, you'll go to the pet store and buy the more 'expensive' brands ... but if you are a 'good pet parent' you'll buy the largest possible package no matter the puppy size.  A tiny puppy may need only one bag of 'puppy food' to last a year if you can buy a 50 pound bag.  Anywhere from $100-500 for the first year.    8. Vet bills and shots:  You'll want a good vet who will spay or neuter your puppy and take care of the 'general health' and shots as well as 'emergency visits.'  Shots can be very expensive at the vet, though, so you may want to buy the 'shot' and syringe and give it yourself or go to a 'shot clinic.'  Most shot clinics cost about $35 for one 'set' of shots ... a puppy needs three sets after 8 weeks of age (once every three weeks) plus rabies shot and other 'once a year' shots ... approximately $200-2000 depending on your puppy and its general health.   The thing your puppy needs most is absolutely FREE ... and you'll get as much from your puppy as you give it.  That is LOVE.  Puppies give unconditional love, and that is PRICELESS.  You must love your puppy and teach it to grow up to be a good, well trained, dog.  You don't need to take the puppy to any 'school' unless you want to ... a school can be really inexpensive ($15) or extremely expensive ($800).  I believe in training my own puppy my own way ... but that is another question for you to ask ...|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Vet bills and shots  Getting the fixed  Food-best quality   Time for exercise and training  Leashes, collars  Dog license    first year, about 800-1000|`|nVhceJeraa	The average through a dogs life is around $1,600 per year if they are a little spoiled otherwise is you just stick to the necessities probably about $1,000.|`|PE0oyIWtaa	The cost for the needs will be way more than the puppy cost itself.  Think vet bills for shots($$), food, toys, cage, leash, collar, bowls, puppy classes.  It will be at least $1000.00, maybe more.  I just got a puppy the day after Thanksgiving and he's been to the vet 3 times to get all of his shots and each time has been over $100.00.  It is a big investment.|`|l7Q5tCpbaa	Depends where you are. In the UK for my Lhasa Apso it cost me:  25 for a parvo vaccine/initial health check  20 for 12 week vaccines (leptospirosis, distempter, parvo)  25 for 14 week vaccines.  6 for food and water bowls  40 for a cage (crate)  20 for a peice of vetbed to put in the crate  15 for a play mat (sheepskin style matt with knotted rope tail, squeaky head, dumbell, ball )  At least another 25 in toys  3.75 for kong  4.99 for puppy collar and lead set  6.50 for puppy pads (don't bother)  3 for tag  5 for paste to put in kong  5 for comforter  our council microchip free - but you may have to pay (our vet wants 45, 35 if done as part of an op)  would be guessing at food around 3 a kilo I think.   10 in grooming set/shampoo (Lhasa Apso - he had to get used to grooming/bathing early)  4.50 dental care set  300 for Insurance.  3 Nail file   5 for wormers  5 frontline flea/tick prevention.    During his first year he also got a sore on his head, which cost another 30 for check-up and anti-biotic cream (vet thought he'd cut it on something)    Plus traing treats, you may need to get rabbis vaccinations (we don't). I'm sure there was more and I have missed something.     You'll also be looking at 30 for booster severy year, depending on size of dog 135 - 230 to spay/neuter and 25 for Kennel Cough vaccine if you want/need to put dog in kennel.     That's over $1000 before you include food, spaying and any emergencies (assuming prices are similar, not vastly cheaper whereever you are). Having dogs isn't cheap. Hugely rewarding, but def not cheap.|`|TYjXGyCzaa	Maybe near a thousand.  Not bad.  Almost like a baby.lol.|`|AAgf2MAuaa	Quite a bit  You gotta get food, treats, cleaning supplies, collors, accesories and other stuff, Over time it adds up trust me!|`|JvY5KL22aa	it all depends on where you go to buy your puppies stuff. i usually go to petsmart and take my puppy with me so he could pick out the stuff he wants. and it's best if you talk someone who works there or your vet the food you should buy your puppy. for me it was like this...  leash: $6  collar: $4  food: $9-12  bowl: $5  toys total: $25  sweater: $9  total: about $61  not too bad... lol, but i had a small dog.   hope this helps somewhat.  this obviously isn't including the vet trips.

It got so bad I called a cat psycholgist (I'm not kidding) and piad her 60.00 an hour to tell me what to do.  Here's what you have to do....and it finally worked!  Put the new kitty in a room by itself with food, water and litter.  Keep the kitty in the room for a few days and the scent will make your older cat curious and will start to sniff around the door...they may even touch paws under the door.  Take a towel and go play with the new kitty and after your play and rub the new kityy, rub your hads and the kitty fur on the towel.  Then go do this with the older cat and a different towel.  Leave a towel with the other kitty scent with each kitty.  They will learn to accept each other when they are familiar with the scent.  After a few days...I did what the Doc said.  I got a clear baby gate and opened the door of the room where the new ktty was.  they would see each other...and there was a little hissing and growling, but only for about 1 day.  then I put their food bowls where they could see each other eat...and I would feed them trats at the same time....so seeing each other through the gat starting being a good experience.  I did this for a couple of weeks, moving the bowls closer and closer to the clear baby gate each day...about 2 inches a day.  finally when they were eating, almose nose to nose(the gate seperating them) I removed the baby gate.  If either cat got aggressive i'd put the gat back up. I kept this up for about a month, maybe alittle less and now my two cats tolerate each other, they even groom each other sometimes...but you have a better shot at things working out more quickly for you.  I had both of my cats for 2 weeks before I was either going to have to get rid of one ro do something drastic.  The doc said once they've had a bad introduction it's hard to undo.  Since you just got your cat today, you won't have much to undo like I did.  I prmise it works, and your older cat still has the run of the house and doesn't feel rejected and the new kitty doesn't know any different so you are not being unkind to confine him to a room for a few days.  Good luck  Sorry for the long answer, but hay, you got it free...it cost me 60.00!

Yorkies are loving cuddly not ot mention cute as a button but can be shy at first then love everyone. In my experience with Dachshunds they are more pushy and controlling but very loving, loyal and overprotective.    So theoretically if you want a dog that is just "yours" and really doesnt like anyone else pick a Dachshund.   If you want one that may be shy at first but warm up and try to go home with your friend and forget all about you then a Yorkie is for you!
PM23RDycaa	Sighthounds - HOARDING is a condition. Have you seen an animal hoarders home? They are filled with the ceiling with animals and garbage. These people mean well but are not capable either financially or mentally to take care of x amount of animals. Its not animal rights nonsense. These people are literally thinking they are doing a good thing when they aren't Its more often seen with cats and you end up with dead cats and kittens in all sorts of places as well a pretty much feral indoor cats because they don't receive the proper attention.    back to the OP    Breeding -  Personally I think the average person has no business breeding let alone making mixed breeds. People don't seem to get that its more than putting two dogs together and that its not as easy as the youtube videos would like to make people think. Especially with small breeds. If you aren't breeding to improve the breed and to standard you shouldn't be breeding. If you're not going to bother doing any health clearances - not breeding. This goes for every step of the process that reputable breeders take.    Breeders vs Shelters/Rescues - Breeders aren't for everyone but neither are rshelters. If you have a breed in mind and want to know this dog backward and forwards, work/show/compete with them or even if you just want a well bred pet quality pup and you're willing to spend the money and time looking for a quality breeder I say go for it and to hell with what other people think.    If you aren't sure what dog you want or your wants are general you have limited funds or you're looking for a mix - then the shelter or rescue is the place for you to go. That being said though not EVERYONE needs to be a pet owner let alone a dog owner in the first place as their motivations for wanting the dog are misguided.    Cropping/Docking - Don't like it? Don't get a breed who's standard calls for it and don't go around preaching to others about it. 9 out of 10 of us don't want to hear it.|`|cETQuE9waa	One subject I feel very strongly about is where you get your dog from. I feel it is fine for someone to go to a breeder, rescue or shelter. I do not support puppy mills, byb, or pet stores.   I feel it is fine to go to a breeder as long as the breeder does genetic testing, breeds to improve the breed, and breeds their dogs to standard. The breeder must do OFA, CERF, MSU, BAER.. Also the breeder must not overbreed their dogs either.|`|k0qTaSceaa	to adopt and rescue dogs or puppies|`|bMYv0fBHaa	BSL, breeding, and lately the docking of tails. That's become a very popular topic around here.    I am a pretty open-minded person, and am willing to hear the person out, unless, and I'll admit this, that person is just spewing out random statements that they simply heard from someone else and are NOT TRUE.    I admit I don't know everything about dogs, but I know a decent amount, and I listen to people, especially if it's something I'm not familar with.|`|hbj6vGE4aa	Ya, I have noticed that a lot of questions are like:    Why are people so dumb that they buy from breeders instead of rescuing.    What's wrong with mutts.    Why don't people neuter their dogs.    Don't you all know that purebreds are stupid.    And on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on...there are less "questions" and more "preaching" for sure.    As for one thing that I would hope to open a few eyes about.  The versatility of dogs...    The lines that my aussie come from can literally do anything.  AKC conformation, herding, agility, obedience, flyball, they do it ALL.    I think that a dog should have the conformation to go out and win dog shows, and then the instinct and brains to do what they were bred to do.  There doesn't need to be a difference between show and working lines, the conformation should lead to the ability, without jeopardizing instinct.|`|pc7ZjexJaa	subjects that I feel strongly on are 'pit bulls' and designer mutts    if I could change the way people feel about designer mutts...I would show them the damage they do    and if I could change the way people see pits...I would show them the good and try and explain the bad in a way that they could at least consider the other side of the story    I also feel VERY VERY strongly about breeding. which gets me in to a lot of trouble    I wish the world was filled with more educated and proactive people      the people in my life respect my opinions on dogs.  but. if someone hits a nerve on one of the subjects I feel strongly on...that person is going to hear a lot. and if its in a way that I react aggressively...too bad for them   I don't like sounding mean or harsh  but I feel very strongly about these things. and when someone is in the wrong-I like to tell them|`|AA11193920	Well, lets see......    Showing isn't for everyone. It takes time and money.    Competing also isn't for everyone. Again it takes time and money.    I work with rescue, although I won't own a mixed breed. I have no problem saving them for others who might want one. I believe that if someone is looking for a pet/companion, they should look into rescue first. However, I am not OCD about demanding people do.    However, when it comes to breeding, I am very OCD. I only think the most knowledgeable should breed. I also feel that those who breed should work with rescue.     If I could change the way average people perceive breeding, I would.|`|RNqHUNgEaa	I would never say my way is best for all dogs and my opinion is the only right opinion, but I do have opinions on certain issues.    I think raw feeding is one of the best ways to feed a dog. I'm not saying everyone should feed raw, what I mean is that I stronly feel raw diets are not harmful at all, like most vets will say. I feel raw is safe and healthy, but not all dogs do well on the same diet. Different dogs require different foods.    I also do not have these PETA-like opinions on breeding. I've heard so many people say, never breed a dog, and all dogs need to be spayed an neutered. If people love dogs this much, spaying and neutering all dogs, would result in no more dogs, if dogs can't breed, then there will be no puppies, and if you like dogs, it would be a sad world without them.    I have heard all this bad talk on Back Yard breeeders, and it's not necessarily true. People who breed for a profit are bad breeders. But the technical definition of a back yard breeder includes people who are not bad breeders and who do not breed for a profit. There are a lot of good people, who breed responsibly but technically would be considered back yard breeders under what most people claim the definition is. They also say that if you purposelly breed two different breeds, you are a bad breeder. I know of people who have had mixes on purpose and they have had a reason for it. A lot of people in New Mexico own sighthound mixes for hunting with falcons (falconry). They are trying to achieve a dog with mixed skills to improve their hunting ability. Several pure bred dogs now got their start as a mix.    Hoarding is a topic that I am adamant on. The term "hoarding" is all animal rights propaganda and should not be used at all. If someone owns 10, 20, 30, even a 100 dogs it does not make them a hoarder. Some people own only 1 dog, and they shouldn't be allowed to own that one, while some people can get by with 100 dogs (I don't know anyone with 100 dogs) and be great at it, you just have to devote all your time to them. If you are able to care for all your dogs the way they should be cared for, then you can have as many as you are able to care for.    Open Field Coursing is the last issue I will talk about, even though it's not entirely dog related. I have read on the HSUS website and several other websites how cruel it is, and how the dogs tear the rabbits up, how they play tug of war with the still alive rabbit, and how the rabbits die slowly. All this is crap. Sighthounds were bred to hunt rabbits and other animals, and it's a fun way to spend with your dog hunting rabbits. They rarely catch the rabbits (only about 1 in 10 times) and the rabbits are always killed quickly. It's not very efficient if a hunting dog plays with the prey, they must kill it swiftly so it can't get away.    I know I talked a lot, but just because these are my opinions, doesn't mean I think everyone should think like this, and I know some of my opinions are very different from a lot of people. People can think whatever they want, even if they are completely wrong, if they want to believe that, it is their own business.|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	1) Docking, if done properly, is an excellent idea and SHOULD be done in certain breeds.    2) Breeding should only be done in dogs that excel in their breed standards and are of excellent temperament and health.    3) Spaying and neutering is the choice of the owner. BREEDING should not be.    I've always been 'my way or the highway', but hey, if people can't handle my opinion, or the opinion of others, they shouldn't have access to the internet anyway.|`|VOIs9Kxqaa	for me, it would be not researching the dog you want to have. If you don't want to bush hair everyday...don't get a shih tzu, if you don't want to spend half your time outside running and playing, dont get an aussie. if you live in an apartment, don't get a mastiff.   pick your dog on breed charastics and not looks!    also, I think its wrong to judge people you don't know. if someone gave they're dog to a shelter...don't be rude to them! I've worked in rescue...its better the ditching your pet in the country to "live on its own" or to be run over. Rescues screen owners and pets to make sure they're a good match.Rescues excersize and feed the dogs. Rescues provide vet care for them. it takes alot of courage to give up a pet and to realize you can no longer provide for it. The owner (in most cases) just want the best for the dog, like everyone else.  also, don't judge a "new" dog owner because they asked a stupid question. at least they're educating themselves now rather then never (granted, they should have done it before they got the dog though).|`|EHF8yYwCaa	APBT's and puppymills.      Kinda odd I guess, considering APBT's aren't my breed....but they are a breed I respect & admire greatly.  I just doubt I'll ever have the appropriate lifestyle where one would be a good match for *me*.  However, my fondness for other breeds also affected by BSL- Dobes, Rotts, etc, kind of transferred over & facilitated my learning about the APBT.  I once found myself frequenting a forum where a lot of highly respected, old-family APBT breeders & fanciers congregated.  I lurked, read, and learned- a LOT, over the course of 3-4 years.  The breed is fascinating.      There is so much misinformation on the breed- from the Web, from the media, from stupid myths and stereotypes, EVEN from some well-meaning breed aficionados who think they're in the right, but in reality they don't fully understand the breed's history, proper temperament, and what kind of home is best suited for the breed.  For instance- the people who gush things like, "APBT's are the best ever family dogs, best breed for anybody, no different than a Labrador, in fact you should go buy one today"....They think they're doing their part to counteract all the "bad press" the breed gets- but the fact is, NO breed is appropriate for "everybody" and the APBT is no exception.  There are plenty more examples of well-meaning misinformation, but that's the one most prevalent around Y!A.      Puppy mills; obvious reasons.  While I don't support "legislation" aimed at hobby breeders (speuter legislation, breeder licensing, etc)....I wouldn't bat an eye if they passed legislation that eliminated the *commercial* dog & cat trade.  It boggles my mind that people can consider "a store in the mall" an appropriate place to obtain a dog.  More people spend time researching vacuum cleaners or microwaves before buying, than they do dogs.  Folks purchasing an appliance will Google consumer reports & reviews.  But look at dropping $800 on a 13+ year long addition to the family....and it's "an impulse buy at the mall".  Heck, I "enlightened" my neighbor last night; she & I went out for dinner in town and the subject of Toy Poodle pups "at the mall" came up.  She has 2 dogs, likes dogs....has the Internet; I was shocked that she'd never heard of puppy mills.  I didn't preach....just told her to Google it, and explained briefly what it was.  There are still WAY too many people who are uninformed.
6eIBIOwoaa	Fences arent inhumane, so dont let anyone tell you so. Yes, you could get one...and train the dog with the flags. Should work...good luck.|`|t5SZ1uAWaa	Sorry but these electronic fences are horrific and cruel to your dog... I wouldnt touch them with a barge pole.  How would you like to be shocked.    If you are taking your pet out for a walk several times a day and before sleep this should be adequate, but please dont use these they are not nice and are as sick as electric shock collars.    Keep searing and find something else or save up for something more appropriate.|`|7WUvPI8maa	you can try to use the fence but also must take into consideration of people maybe calling your dog... my friend used to have it for her dog but it got to the point where if it wanted to really get out it would just run through the fence and though the shock voltage was all the way up and would repeatedly escape. i wish you the best of luck.|`|AA12074846	I had one for my german shepard and it worked for a little while. She had a high prey drive so she ran thru the fence even on the highest setting. If your dog doesn't like to chase things its probably food for her. Good Luck|`|AA11443269	DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!    The shock is slight and only of scare value. Sooner or later if the dog is halfway intelligent it will learn that it can just walk through it or wait until the battery is dead and it will not even get a shock.   Unless the shock was debilitating, you could never be sure that it would stop the dog. If the dog see something (rabbit, cat) and without thinking charges after it and along comes a car well that is it.   I have known personally several people who have tried those fences, all regrettably.  Save the $200 and when you can invest it into a fence.|`|Amkmles0aa	get books all dogs|`|3p6wp7DYaa	Although I don't have one of those, I wanted to make sure you know the arguments against using this type of fence. As you may know, they are very controversial because they not always work, but they can do real damage if used incorrectly. If the dog's really interested in whatever is out there she might just take the shock and keep going. Say she's chasing a squirrel and it bolts out of the backyard, running for its life. If she has a high prey drive, she might take the shock over giving up the chase.     Those fences cannot just be used right out of the box. You need to hire a professional who trains the dogs on how to understand the warnings, how to know where the boundaries are, etc. You can't just buy the product, you have to also buy the service. Otherwise you will inflict lots of damage in this animal and she may even be so traumatized that she won't even want to go on the backyard anymore. The dilemma is: if the shock is too mild, she may just keep going anyway. If the shock is too much, she will be traumatized.    Think about it long and hard before you do this. Maybe taking her to a dog park where she can play off-leash and run around freely might be a better alternative, at least until you figure that out. Check out this information: http://luvurdog.com/dogtraining/Electron...|`|OGLulBtwaa	maybe he's upset because you love your chihuahua more|`|aCqSF87Raa	It's different for each dog. They work well with some, but poorly with others.    Some dogs cannot use them because their nature and disposition make the shocks 100 times worse and end up fearful of the yard. Fearful dogs, shy dogs, or just plain mellow dogs may end up worse off with one of these fences.    Some dogs just don't care about the zap and will run right through to get what's on the other side. Most high energy breeds, hunting breeds, and similar would rather face the zap to run full out or get the animal or person on the other side.    And depending on where you live and where you place the fence, it could affect other dogs as well. My aunt's dog, naturally fearful, is now dog aggressive due to the neighborhood dogs rushing him/them on walks. He can't see the fence and thinks they're going to attack him, so he learned to growl, lunge, and bare teeth.    If you live in a low traffic area where you dog won't be able to rush at passers by, and your dog is already well trained to recall, you could try it. But if you live in an area where there are lots of people and other dogs, animals, anything that could distract your dog enough to make him ignore the zap... i wouldn't.    Also keep in mind that a Golden Retriever has thick neck fur and you may have to shave a patch or get longer prongs for the collar to actually TOUCH the skin. Otherwise it won't work.     Either way, have a professional install it AND teach you how to teach your dog the basics.|`|v7CjvhBeaa	They sometime seem to work good, old neighbours of mine had one, but the dogs they had constantly kept getting out. Just make sure the voltage isnt turned up to high, as chihuahua's are tiny dogs. I've heard people try the shock out on themselves, so chances are if it hurts you, it will definitely hurt the dog. Also pricing wise, I thought that they were very expensive, but cant say Ive ever bought one.|`|B8Gwxo1laa	I've heard stories of persistent dogs who defy the fence as well. If you take your dog for daily walks, and maybe weekly trips to the park (with a Very Long leash, that what we have for our Runaway), she should be fine.  Also, maybe you could rig up a clothesline run in the backyard.

hoAeWwJDaa	Reads as if he is just an energetic adult horse with some experience, and doesn't just sit like a lump when getting ready to ride or when with a person. He won't be dull ride, and as with most horses, he constantly gets little reminders to stay beside, not in front on lead, wait for command/approval, and has boundaries and rules re-established regularly to keep his head on straight. Ask specifically about his experience with children, his "nuance" and intuition with green small riders, as he may just be "pushy" with adults. I've seen many attempt to question adults yet convert to gentleness and ease for a child.<br>  <br>  Previous posts recommending a trial handling and ride are dead on. We purchased a 12 y.o. Arabian mare 10 years ago, despite the owner honestly describing her as head-shy, "too eager" to do anything but walk, and difficult to manage. She was a GEM under saddle, took command well, had a NATURAL extended trot, good ear and intuition, and after 2 weeks of desensitization and positive reinforcement, NO headshyness at all. I bought a QH filly 11 years ago after she was described as "imprintable," calm demeanor, takes command well, great lineage of competitors and "drive" to ride... she was a stubborn, scared, untrusting, non-socialized or imprinted, was sensitive to all the wrong stimuli and desensitized to human communication/correction. Every day, to this day, she challenges me, and I love it, but she was not "as advertised." She's taught me much in 11 years, and I didn't have a cohort with me on that one to consult with and keep my eye unbiased and observant.<br>  <br>  So, go and see, ideally with a trainer/professional friend who can help you assess with a keen eye, more observant and detached to gauge his true value and ability!<br>  <br>  His body language in the pics seems tuned in to his rider and enjoying the heck out of the ride! So far, only positives until you are proven otherwise ;]|`|SYsP6oD7aa	"little pushy" to me translates that he probably will knock you down. Has not been trained to yield to whomever is trying to handle him. If he seems o.k. for you in all other ways you can work with him and bring him out of this, watch the current owner handle him and see what they are or are not doing to correct this. A "pushy" horse can be scary and dangerous if the behavior is not changed.|`|VRoiGUW9aa	Pushy on the ground means that he doesn't have very good ground manners.

Sometimes halt randomly when leading him, and take a little bit to make him budge.<br>  2. Shake his head on the crossties irritably.<br>  3. He could be spooky when being led around.<br>  4. He might move to the side during grooming or bathing.<br>  5. Fuss when the girth is tightened.<br>  6.

See how his head isn't being held high or in a "irritated" way? He seems calm and holds his neck pretty level. He also doesn't have a standing martingale on, which could hint that he doesn't ever hold his head too high. That's also a bonus.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh, and I know you didn't ask, but just some extra help haha.<br>  <br>  Are you wondering about taking lessons from these people? If you are... I advise you not to, or at least from what I can see in the third picture.<br>  <br>  The rider's jump position is horrible. See how his leg slipped back behind the girth?

You're pretty lucky if he's everything they say (not accusing them of lying, just saying he sounds really good). I'd go see him and make sure you do extensive ground handling with him to make sure pushy doesn't mean dangerous. When you do go see him, make sure the owners don't try to avoid you handling him on the ground or minimize situations where bad behaviour might occur (i.e. they close all the stall doors so the horse doesn't run into one). Make sure you and your daughter can both handle him. If you have a coach, bringing him/her a long for a second opinion helps a ton. Also, make sure you see the lease agreement.<br>  <br>  As for the horse, he looks very cute. He's not going to go to the top level of anything, but if he's sound and broke, he looks like he'd be a ton of fun for your purposes.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|bqbrKFeUaa	He looks amazing.

The horse, when your leading him, could rear, push you around, and maybe strike you. To solve this problem, you would need to do some round pen ground work before you got in the saddle. I would get Clinton Anderson's Round Penning DVD. I've used it, and it has given be great results! <br>  <br>  Looks like a great horse besides that! Hope This Helps!|`|KiNqEAxtaa	My first impression... <br>  <br>  A great horse, but not suited for a timid 11-year-old. The fact that they call him "pushy" and that he is ridden by a male suggest he might be a handful. This is one-hundred percent presumption, but statistically adult males tend ride horses who need a little bit of strong-arming. He may be a great horse, but he might just be a bit too much for a young rider.<br>  <br>  That said, I have never had any contact with the horse. I would schedule some rides (more than one!!) to get to know the horse. The best trick? Show up unscheduled one day and scope him out. A lot of owners will lunge or ride the heck out of their mount before a prospect shows up in order to create a docile pony. Catch him fresh! Also, have you daughter do everything she normally would do with him: catch him in the field, walk him to and from the field (a time when horses can be pillish), work him with other horses in the arena, work him with strange things/noises happening, etc.<br>  <br>  Good luck! Best!|`|bI7wMCJXaa	Pushy on the ground, aka, being a pig, means that on the ground he's going to try to walk ahead of you, stop and graze whenever he pleases and in general be a jerk. This is not the same as being a terror and it can be trained out with one or two natural horsemanship sessions.<br>  <br>  If you think this might be the right horse for you go see him and see how he handles on the ground. I do advise bringing an experienced horse person with you to make sure you're getting what you think you're getting.

From my own experiences, it's difficult to maintain the water quality with an oscar in a 55 gallon, and I was doing 2 large water changes a week as well.      Not sure how large your other fish are, but if they're small enough to fit into the oscar's mouth, they very well might end up eaten by him as well.  They're not "predators", but they do have the tendency to eat everything.|`|ZktjgoeNaa	I wouldnt.  In my opinion I wouldnt house an Oscar in less than a 75 gallon if you want to have other fish.

But for ALL "clean meats" (animals created specifically for humans to eat such as cows, deer, sheep, goats, pigeons, dove) for regular food, all of them must be bled.     Genesis 8:4 "But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall ye not eat."    Blessings.|`|AA12044219	the blood must be poured out and covered with dust...Leviticus 17:13
H06PtiIAaa	bamboo sharks need at least 250 gallon aquarium for one.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	That's one of the smallest sharks, so a 300 to 400 gallon tank might do.
KEYgd73saa	It's most likely constipation.  What have you been feeding it?  Try giving it some green vegetable matter (split peas, blanched lettuce, zucchini, cucumber, spinach, etc.) to "loosen up" whatever is in the way.  If this doesn't work, it may be an infection (impossible to diagnose what kind without a veritable lab) or even just mechanical malfunctions (ducts controling the swim bladder not working as they should).  Regardless, keep the water clean (0 ppm ammonia and nitrite, less than 20 ppm nitrate) and hope for the best-- it often clears up on its own.
gWMMD81Jaa	I had a diabetic cat. The costs would be about the same. Insulin costs less then $20 and lasted 2-3 months before we'd have to buy more. A box of syringes are less than $15 for a box of 100, that will last you 50 days. I found that it wasn't that hard to care for him. I was very lucky that I had my cat for an additional 6 years after he was diagnosed with diabetes. If you gave your dog to a rescue, chances are he won't be adopted and might be put down. Try taking care of him before you make any choices about getting rid of him. He will live a good, normal life. I never felt that it was an inconvenience and I am sure you won't either. Talk to your vet about any questions you might have. Good luck!|`|tPGxPDvBaa	It generally isn't hard to deal with diabetes in dogs cuz it is far easier to limit what foods they get compared to ppl.  The meds are not expensive & easy to give injections.  I have many clients with dogs with diabetes that have no problems.  If a lil old granny can learn quite easily how to test & give a dog a shot, so can you.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Once a diabetic dog is regulated it can be a very manageable disease.  However, it can take months to get under control and during that time you will need to bring him in for weekly (or every other week) blood draws and he will need frequent bloodwork once the disease is controlled.  Financially, this could be a problem.  The dilemma here is that not many rescues are going to have the resources to devote to a diabetic dog who, in addition to being special needs is most likely also an older dog, is frankly not very adoptable.  Discuss your options with your vet.  If you can find a rescue who would be willing to rehome him then that is an option...but it's going to be VERY difficult and his chances of finding a new home with this condition are not very good, especially in this economy.  Your vet may be able to work out payment plans of some kind with you if you discuss your financial concerns with them regarding the regulation and treatment of his diabetes.  Or you may have to consider making him as comfortable as possible for as long as possible and euthanizing him when his quality of life declines too far.  It's a tough situation to be in and I don't envy the decisions you have to make now.|`|ZddQ0XHmaa	insulin is fairly cheap, as are syringes. Monthly, about the cost of a daily cup of coffee.|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	It will be very difficult to find a home for a diabetic dog, most people aren't looking for a dog with a health condition.  Diabetes is not difficult to manage though, as the other answers already said.  The medication is not that expensive, giving the injections is easy.  Talk to your vet, good luck.|`|J4zjrNpLaa	It's not hard to take care of a dog with diabetes once you fall into the routine of what needs to me done for him.    Testing his blood sugar, giving him insulin and monitoring his diet & exercise are the major tasks that you'll need to undertake.    With discipline though, it will simply be a part of your normal schedule and won't be a big deal at all.    Here's a great article that talks a little bit more about taking care of a dog with diabetes:  http://www.dog-health-works.com/lp/dog-d...    Good Luck!

But I guess it could be done. I do know some people that use the puppy pads.  Why can't you take him outside?  That would be the healthiest way for everyone in the house.  If you are determined to use a litter box they do make a spray for puppy pads that makes the dog want to go where it is sprayed.  That might help.

f71bc553ce48de0d47d00ce15fd871aaaa	i like to think of algae like fire, instead of heat-fuel-oxygen for fire it<br>  nutrients-light-CO2 for algae<br>  <br>  first thing you should do is dial back your light cycle, since you already have coral dial it back to 8 hours max, you could do a 3 day lights out but with out removing the nutrients the algae will just bounce back<br>  <br>  adding a refugium to your tank with cheato or caulerpa will help out compete the nuisance algae for nutrients and CO2 <br>  <br>  other methods of nutrient control include adding a media reactor  with GFO (granular ferric oxide) to strip out phosphates and silicates,<br>  <br>  also carbon dosing, adding small amounts of sugar, vodka or other disolveable carbon sources, the carbon bonds with nitrates making a heavier compound that can be removed with protein skimming, be warned read up on this method before trying it, add too much vodka and your fish will love you like a brother right before they all die <br>  <br>  and opening up a window will allow more carbon dioxide out and fresh air in allowing less co2 into the tank during gas exchange <br>  <br>  and then we have adding nutrients to the tank in the first place, make sure your source water is free of nitrates and phosphates, feed less and less often, rinse frozen food in ro water, before adding it to the tank, <br>  <br>  <br>   as for adding animals for algae control im not a big fan of this, its kinda like controling california wild fires by adding a few rinos to the moutains, sure it will run over and stop out the fire, great now you have a heard of wild rinos running around, and just because a tang eats algae doesnt me they eat that kind of algae, now if you always wanted a fox face or a lown mower blenny by all means get one they may even help you out|`|lvvm9MMiaa	Water changes can help to remove excess minerals that may be contributing to the algae bloom. I would suggest doing more frequent partial water changes until the algae is under control.<br>  <br>  If you want to get a fish to help the the algae under control long-term, there are several good choices. Lawnmower Blennys are excellent at eating algae, but sometimes they will eat too much and then have nothing left. Fish that graze would also be good choices. For your size tank, a Yellow Tang would be good at helping - they like to graze frequently. <br>  <br>  I suggest going to your local fish store and asking them for their professional advice. <br>  <br>  Good luck getting the algae under control!|`|eJ97Qdooaa	You will have to control the nutrients in your tank.  If you're tank is being overtaken by algae, then you will need to put in a macro algae in the main tank that will absorb the nutrients and not allow the algae to get any.  I had the same problem in my 72g reef.  <br>  <br>  I put a guppy breader container in my 72g with some chaetomorpha in it and within 2 weeks, all of the algea on the rocks were starved of nutrients and went away.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.reeflove.com/getting-rid-hair-algae" rel="nofollow">http://www.reeflove.com/getting-rid-hair...</a><br>  <br>  and for other algaes like red bubble, I just bought a yellow tang and it ate most of it within a few days<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.reeflove.com/getting-rid-red-bubble-algae" rel="nofollow">http://www.reeflove.com/getting-rid-red-...</a>|`|AA11901352	A yellow tang will help (as well as black mollies yes they can be added to salt and neither will harm your coral)<br>  <br>  You can add a phosporus pad into the protein (bubble) chamber.

You may also want to plant some actual aquatic plants to suck up the nutrients so that algae can't grow. Or of course, manual labor. No one ever said aquarium keeping was easy. There is a lot of elbow grease involved.<br>  <br>  Apparently Tangs love algae.|`|qeOlkRM0aa	You probably have nitrates and phosphates in your water.<br>  Do you have maiden's hair, or hair algae (bryopsis)? They are not the same.I'm betting the latter. What other algae do you have? How's your coraline algae? Manual removal, is the most reliable method. Lawnmower Blennies are great, but may or may not eat hair algae-most critters won't. Sometimes,  Mexican Turbo snails  will eat hair, but that seems to be an individual thing-some do some wont touch it. I'm not a fan of turbos.<br>  i like to watch crabs in the tank, but despite claims, they won't solve you problem either.<br>  You could set up a refugium with Caulerpa or Cheato-that's a commitment.<br>  What kind of lights do you have? What kind of skimmer?<br>  Hows you water quality?
tPGxPDvBaa	It applies also to hunting or working dogs.  It helps to keep their ears from getting ripped or caught on underbush or shrubs.  However most crops are done for appearance only nowadays.  I would like to see only dogs actually working dogs have crops done.  I had a show dane with cropped ears & it was painful & a long recovery period for those edges to heal completely.  She didn't want me to touch her ears at all for about year after it was done & this after only having to wrap & tape them a few times.|`|cJxNY1Ctaa	ear cropping is more about vanity and looks than anything really. i think its extremely cruel as well as extremely painful for the pups.|`|xkzkCtrUaa	That is terrible.

That search for questions bar up there would've saved you points :)    In some breeds, it can cut down on ear infections.  In others, it's a breed standard.      Often times people have no idea what the truth is and blame it on cosmetic reasons :)|`|P2yRAWiJaa	The only time a dogs tail should be docked is if it is actually a working dog.  If it's a show dog it's no longer required and can go au' natural.    Ear cropping is purely aesthetic and done more for the owners pleasure than anything.  Some people say it's better for the dog to have shorter ears if it's in a fight (makes you wonder what these people do with their dogs!).  Again, it serves no purpose and natural ears are accepted in the show ring.

As for feeding, the vet told me to buy Gerber'ss chicken and veggies baby food and feed trough a syringe until it was old enough to eat solid food. I would call your vet and ask about the dosage for the syrup and baby food for your puppy's weight before you start any of this though, too much of the syrup would be bad.|`|5b697ae5264bc19d33f3ae5c96b9fb0caa	Have you taken the puppy to the vet?

9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	You can keep guppies in bare tanks if you want to. That's what the large-scale breeders usually do.    If you want live plants (unless they are purely floating plants), you will need a substrate for the plant roots. The usual one is gravel. Gravel with grains about one-eighth to one-fourth inch in diameter is the best size. Also consider one of the special substrates sold for planted tanks, such as Laterite or Flourite. They provide nutrients to the plants, which ordinary gravel does not.|`|0b8c6deec73968ee5de1b69c2345788caa	natural stone|`|hzxQMU0Caa	get a layer of the sand or thing the the plant u want can grow int then put a layer of river rocks over the sand.|`|6CbEYn2Saa	if your going to get any plants then I'd just get simple but fine gravel the finer the better, nothing amazing just plain gravel... if you want you can put some laterite in it or something....|`|NUIrBHXgaa	Go with a darker substrate, lighter substrates tend to detract from the colors of the fish, while darker ones tend to show them off better.
cToJQNknaa	You have too many questions to start up a tank right now. You need to do some research on tank keeping and aquarium fish. You also need to read about the tank cycle first. I will answer some of your questions though    Crabs and lobster will eat any slow moving fish, so thats not a real good idea. Plus lobster like cold water while tropical fish require warmer water.    test kits can be bought at any pet store. A complete cycle takes anywhere from two to four weeks.    you need to do water changes and gravel syphons to keep a clean tank.    snails are good cleaners for your tank, just need to add calcium supplements to your tank to help their shells stay healthey. and algae eaters are exactly what they sound like.    BUT DO YOUR ON RESEARCH. YAHOO ANSWERS ARE HERE FOR YOUR SMALL QUESTIONS.

6AnuPGD9aa	Quote<br>  <br>  Mouth-rot (or Stomotitis) is usually uncommon. When present in leopard geckos, it is usually the result of fighting. The first symptoms include a mouth that doesn't close quite right or that is slightly swollen. This is usually followed with a loss of appetite. Upon inspection of the inside of the mouth, varying degrees of swelling as well as areas of caseous (cheesy-looking) matter will be visible. <br>  <br>  If it resembles mouth-rot there is treatment :<br>  Treatment consists of daily cleaning of the affected area with Betadyne or hydrogen peroxide. Application of a tropical antibiotic will help, such as Neosporin. Some herpetoculturists will apply a tiny amount of tetracycline solution. <br>  If it doesn't clear up within 2 weeks you should consult a vet for an oral or injectable antibiotic.<br>  <br>  <br>  I honestly cannot think of what else it might be, but it def sounds like an infection or prehaps a bruise.

PSiNv7gUaa	Jungle Earth would be fine, also cypress mulch is great.  You can sometimes find crested geckos cheaper at expos, but not always.  I used to work at a pet store where males and females would sell for $90, which is CHEAP for a good female.  You could pay double that for females from a breeder.  However, you can usually get really good deals on adult males from expos.  Color morphs are going to cost more either way.  Also, adults with normal tails can sometimes cost more at expos, as crested geckos tend to get crooked tails from the way they hang on glass.  Check prices at local pet stores, then go check out what they have at an expo.  You never know what deals can be made (particularly if you wait until toward the end of an expo, when breeders are desperate to get rid of their stock).|`|bqZQxYUraa	Jungle earth is good. You could also use low impact substrates such as repticarpet, paper towels and newspaper. Reptile expos do sell reptiles for cheaper usually. It all depends on what your looking for though. I was at one last weekend and picked up a albino tangerine for 15 bucks and a SHTCT for 20. But then again I also bought a co-dom snow enigma for 105. So its all about what coloration of gecko your looking for.|`|E3VJAXDZaa	This site has tons of great info to help you out    http://www.reptilesexotic.webs.com/
o93EwErKaa	You don't put a rubberband on an umbilicial cord.  Dip it in iodine to prevent an infection from entering the bloodstream via this route.  I am assuming the placenta (sack attached to the umbilical cord) is not attached.  If the cord is still bleeding, you can pinch it or tie with dental floss.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes you need to hold the mom down and supervise to let the puppy nurse.  Nursing releases hormones in the mom that will make her more motherly, but never trust a mom alone with a puppy until you are sure she won't hurt it.  It might be that she is having another puppy, but usually mom is still interested in the puppies between the births (licking them, but not feeding them).  Keep the puppy warm with a heating pad on low underneath a blanket if mom is still delivering.  Honestly, I have never had a newborn "cry like a siren" so it may have been injured somehow.|`|PM23RDycaa	*shakes head* call a vet. Better yet have your mother take your dog and her pup TO the damn vet and let them handle this.<br>  <br>  ADD: What do you mean no vet?  No on in this house, you your brother or your mother knows what to do with a dog in labor. Call or go to the vet. What are you going to do if she has another pup that gets stuck and cannot be pushed out?|`|EeJMITyCaa	Go to the vet before the puppy dies! Make sure that the puppy is drink. Put the puppy up to the mother's nipple so that the puppy will drink. Make sure the puppy stays close to the mother so that the pup will stay warm. Make sure the puppy eats and go to the vet because you don't know how many more are coming! If for some reason the mother dog refuses to feed the pup then you need to go to the pet store and get some milk replacement for puppies and feed the puppy that. You may need a heating pad and you also need to keep the house warm. If the dog is being a good mother then you don't need the heating pad but you do need to keep the house warm.|`|AA11887983	Call your vet.  You need to know how many she is going to have, and how to help her.  You also need to know when you need to be concerned.  Dental floss works best to tie off the umbilical cord, but if the dog is cleaning the pups, she will tear it and it should be fine.  <br>  <br>  If she is still in labor, she may not pay a ton of attention to the pups.  But keep a close watch and talk to your vet, now.|`|6a0f5242e106e58c4ca1b110e61eb592aa	Call a vet or a animal hospital now...and get help and advice. So what are you waiting for?

She'll be in pain and won't pay any attention to the one she has.  Also, there may be something wrong with the puppy that you can't see but she can sense.  And if someone touched the puppy before the mom got a chance to, that may affect her and she may not recognize the puppy as hers.  The mom will need a vet immediately in order to deliver the rest of the puppies (if any) by cesarean section.<br>  <br>  The first thing to do is get some food into that puppy.  Try to put the puppy up to its mom's nipples and see if it will nurse.  If it won't nurse after about 5 minutes of trying, you may need to bottle feed it at first.<br>  <br>  You can find out about bottle feeding puppies at <a href="http://leerburg.com/bottlefeeding.htm" rel="nofollow">http://leerburg.com/bottlefeeding.htm</a> but you'll need to get your vet to intubate the puppy for his first meal.  Use the formula on the page I just gave you the URL to.  <br>  <br>  In fact, follow all the directions on that page if the mother dog doesn't want anything to do with the puppy.   The puppy HAS to be kept warm.  And he HAS to be fed regularly at about 3 hour intervals.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Apacapacas|`|yzFxc5uXaa	you need to go to the vet now, dogs dont just have one puppy. there are more puppies shes trying to get out and obviously having trouble and in pain. after your vet delivers the pups get her spayed since obviously your not mature or educated enough to have litters<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  No vet ho? thats your response... just proves my point about you not being mature or educated, your dog and the puppy will probably die enjoy that on your shoulders and dont tell me theres no vet there are emergency vets and if you called a normal vet that was closed they normally have extensions for emergencies|`|iVapI5JPaa	Sometimes the baby gets rejected and who knows why?

Sometimes new moms aren't sure what she's suppose to do. You can try moving her to a smaller box. If you're using a crate, then try putting a blanket over the top to give her privacy. Make sure that there isn't a lot of visitors, no other dogs allowed to go near her or her pups, and keep her room quiet. Mom's will try to move her pups when she doesn't feel safe. Just make sure that there aren't a lot of people coming and going in her room, no visitors until the pups are older. Don't handle the pups a lot at first, let her feel safe. Just keep an eye on them, and handle them when she goes outside to potty. You can try a smaller box, this may help. If the box is too big, and the pups are spread out, it may freak her out because she's having such a hard time keeping them together.  If this doesnt work in the next few hours call your vet and ask him.|`|yXUS7jz5aa	Stick the pup under the mums nose if she still ignores it she might be having trouble with her birthing.Take the rubber band off,unless its constantly bleeding,you might have a trip to the vet on your hands.see if the mum is pushing her stomach muscles and if she doesn't have a pup in the next 2 hours get her to the vet.|`|8zgnKkL7aa	Most mother dogs will try to push a puppy away if the know something is wrong with it is one reason why.

Not an age issue, it sounds like a poor water quality issue.  Goldies have the potential to live 20+ years, so he's still a baby really.    Popeye is usually seen with dropsy, and they're brought on by poor water quality most of the time.  Same with the cloudy eye.  Same with the missing scales, which is a sign of stress.  Goldfish commonly change colors, black moors to gold/orange, comets from orange to white/silver.  That's most likely not related to anything.    Need more info though to give you better advice.    What size is your tank?    How many/what types of fish are in it?    How large is the goldfish?    How often do you do water changes?    How much water do you change out each time?      Hard to say if it's too late or not for you fish, but it might just be a matter of clearing up the water quality or increasing the tank size.  You can email me those answers if you'd like and I can give you a better idea.  Good luck!

3z6RFfA5aa	If you get ducklings keep a fence between them and your dog until they can fly.  Most ducks at this point will have the sense enough to get away if the dog charges toward them.  However, it will be up to you to supervise and determine if they can ever be safely left together unsupervised.  My dogs and my ducks did fine together on a normal everyday basis.  I did however have a problem with the dogs getting too 'playful' at times and the ducks can get hurt if your not watching.  Ducklings are very fragile and until they are fully feathered and mature enough to understand when danger approaches, only allow them to be friends through a fenced in area.  Good luck!|`|SRs6xcxPaa	probaly not because it did not get along with the other animals but sometimes it can happen maybe the only animal your dog likes is a duck you never know|`|F08HDRvraa	I wouldn't count on it.  I had a basset hound that was around cats and guinea pigs and she ended up getting a hold of and killing one of my ducklings.  She just reacted differently to them than she did to the cats and guinea pigs, I'm not sure why.  A retriever is a type of hunting dog as well, so I would be concerned that she would view these ducks as prey.

If he just came from a place where there were a bunch of other puppies to play with and he was getting a lot of exercise, then of course if he is not getting the same he is going to become a little riled up and anxious.

Set rules that are humane but consistently enforced. Let him know that toys are a treat, not a privilege, and that food is always served on YOUR schedule, not his.  if not properly treated at an early age, the aggression can develop into a more serious problem and will be much more difficult to fix at an older age. If you act quickly and consistently enough, your puppy will halt its aggressive behavior before it even becomes an issue.  Socialize your dog! The more used to other dogs and people, your puppy less likely he will develop common aggression problems later in life. Show him respectful behavior towards children, visitors, and other dogs and reinforce this behavior.   Have your family memebers give him treats so that he sees them as a good thing not a threat. If your puppy growls at anyone when he is on your lap, immediately say NO in a firm voice and put him down on the floor. do this every time and he will learn that he wont get to be on your lap if he acts in a bad way.  Your puppy may misbehave from time to time, but if you keep your calm, remember your training methods, and act like the boss, your pup will quickly learn what's acceptable and what's not.|`|Em5MeGRxaa	maybe he feels closer to you and he feels threatened when your bro and parents come close to him|`|p8jEQBVVaa	Sounds like you need to give him a "purpose".  The old saying about idle hands doing the devil's work applies to dogs, too.

Good luck!|`|KTQSsqEdaa	if you have kids you should let them run with him for about 20 min.  and if it's not potty trained try and put a puppy pad in where it sleeps.  and in your back yard get a pee pee stick and your puppy will go there on it.

They do not always act like puppies though, so when it gets old, it gets old. Miniature dogs may also not live as long, because of their unnatural size.     Maybe a  Chihuahua, Dachshund, or a Yorkie?  Miniature Pinchers are small dogs, but they are extremely hyper. Yorkies are more one-person dogs, so probabley not a good family pet.

pDPSaL37aa	I'm so sorry this happened to you and Jessy. Don't blame yourself. Unfortunately, accidents happen and I don't really think anyone is to blame in this since you didn't know Jessy was behind the car. In every relationship there are disagreements and arguments, so I wouldn't blame your boyfriend either. You just need to be more careful and not get behind the wheel of a car when you are in that state of mind. You probably won't ever get that horrible image of Jessy out of your head, but try to allow better memories of her to overpower that thought. You should try to make a little memorial for her in your house. Post up some photo's and write about all of the good memories you have of her. This may help you get through this tough time. I believe animals do have spirits and souls and go to heaven when they die. I heard that the hearing is the last sense to go, so she may have heard your voice when you called her. You should think of it as her telling you it wasn't your fault and she still loves you. Again, I'm so sorry about your loss.|`|xkzkCtrUaa	aww..How terrible thats what happened to my aunt.

Obviously your boyfriend was being dumb for being on the bonnet of the car, and you shouldn't have been driving around crazily like that, even if your dog wasn't there it was a bad move your could have crash into something else too.    However all creatures have spirits, not one is superior to another despite what many Christians believe.|`|uQrIdrjfaa	ur boy friend u dump him immedietly girl frend|`|VtHvcEtuaa	I think that you learned a lesson about how dangerous it is to fool around with cars.

And yes it is your fault. You where mad got in the car and killed the dog. You could have done it a better way. YES it was your fault. Hope you have learned now. Poor Jessy.|`|RFfTjnxzaa	I'm afraid it was your fault. Hopefully this will teach you not to get behind the wheel of a car when you're upset.

And your mother is wrong... animals have spirits and feelings.|`|t5tRvpnbaa	probably was just the last spasms|`|LGV9uiFLaa	Don't feel bad it was an accident!

Amkmles0aa	get off yahoo answers and get to the vet now  bec. your cat is not doing ok  ps the vet may have to chat about puting down your cat|`|nmWztjGMaa	Use an enzyme cleaner on the area and go ahead and put another litter box on the area she keeps using.  you can slowly move the box towards the area you want her to use or after she is using it again remove it.  Change the room around so she is unaccustomed to the environment after you remove the new box or just try moving everything around first.  sometimes they get into bad habits and you just have to breat the cycle.|`|zmQfVCh9aa	she may be feeling not well|`|I2frHIj1aa	This happened to my cat for awhile...Is the floor that the cat peeing on carpet? If its not what I dad was I rubbed/sprayed a citrus fruit on the floor (I guess cats dont like the smell of it), and he stopped. If that doesnt work for you try looking at petco or somthin, I know that they make things that keeps cats out of certain areas that you spray. Hope I helped!|`|JKKR67M9aa	Theres many reasons why this could be happening.     Maybe she doesnt like peeing in the same place as other cats?  Maybe the box isnt clean enough    Have you recently changes the kitty litter - maybe to a different brand??    I would suggest having her outside more often see if she goes to the loo in the garden maybe then you could use soil as litter.     there's alot of other option for kitty litters.    have a look at kitty kwitter or litter kwitter - its pretty amusing but it works so Ive been told. I just sold my kit off coz my cat goes to the toilet outside now which saves me the time and sanity LOL    good luck.|`|viUbPWNTaa	This could have a medical cause - possibly a urinary tract infection (UTI) or even diabetes.    A UTI causes pain when the cat urinates and they can associate the pain with the box and then urinate outside of the box.    One of the classic symptoms of diabetes is increased urination which is caused by the kidneys dumping some of the excessive glucose that is in the blood into the bladder, increasing the amount of urine.    This causes increased thirst, so diabetic cats drink more and they also lose weight - two more of the classic symptoms of diabetes.    A diabetic cat urinates so much that either they simply can't get to the box every time or they just give up and urinate in other spots.    Your vet can check for a UTI or diabetes with by examioning the cat's urine.    For diabetes - if there is excessive glucose in the cat's blood and there is glucose in the cat's urine, 97% of the time the diagnosis is diabetes.    Talk to your vet about it.    As far the odor - pet stores have products which contain enzymes which will break down the odor causing chemicals. Check them out.    As to litter boxes in places other than the bathroom - we have a few cats - can't tell you how many :-) One of our litter boxes is in the bedroom and there is no odor problem if we keep it clean.    Good Luck    We have a web site about diabetic cats http://www.sugarcatsimon.com|`|4pDpAKHwaa	Did you change the type of litter that you put in your box?    Buy Feliway Pheromone Spray. Spray it in the spot where your cat is peeing until he or she stops peeing on the floor.     It worked for my cat and I guarentee it will work for yours!
Qc0x3Ldaaa	That depends.  You can leave the pup in the crate longer at night than during the day.  Depending upon the breed, puppies that age can hold themselves (at night) for about 7 hours.  During the day, I would make sure the pup is out of the crate every couple of hours.|`|AA11171398	Every 2-3 hours, just in case. Your schedule should go:    Morning- let out of crate to go straight out to potty.  If he doesn't potty, put him back in for 10 minutes max and then let him straight back out.   Once he goes, feed him breakfast and put him back in his crate.   1 hour later let him striaght out to potty.  Nothing, back in for 10 minutes.  Afterwards he can come into the house for play time.  Every hour during playtime, let him out where he is to potty.  Max playtime-3hrs depending on size.  Right before going back into the crate, potty time.  Let him sleep.  Wake up- out to potty.  Nothing, back in for 10 minutes.  Come back in to eat lunch.  Wait 1 hr, then out to potty.  Nothing, comes in for 10.  Playtime.  Potty walk every hour during play.  Back in for dinner.  Take away water for the night after eating.  Wait 1 hr, then out to potty.  A bit more play time before bed.   Last time out to potty should be as late as possible.     If you don't have a lot of confidence in your pup, then wake up in the middle of the night to let him out for a potty walk.    After a while he will associate going to the bathroom as a good thing.    His crate should be big enough to stand up and turn around with bowls inside, and long enough to stretch out without being cramped. Not big enough that he can poop in one end and sleep in another.|`|64dbb28e46e49a5128e72f8e50eb883eaa	I have a 9 wk old puppy and I take him out every 2-3 hours during the day and then cut off his water at about 6 or 7 pm so that I only have to get up with him twice during the night.

f0fAx8vgaa	i build both wood and metal framed barns that are all covered externally with metal.both work well with livestock but wood framed barns tend to be less expensive than steel framed barns but the thing that you need to consider is the environment that it will be in,both hold up well in high winds and against livestock so the thing you need to decide is how much you are willing to spend on a barn and the size you will grow into.|`|G0KKfXMUaa	I haven't been around them too much.<br>  <br>  In my experience, most average barns are a mix of wood, cement, and brick.<br>  <br>  Brick and cement being the base walls for normal support and strong support against storms and other bad situations.<br>  <br>  Wood being used for things that aren't so vulnerable. <br>  <br>  But metal could work. I actually would think it would be better, considering wood is highly flammable. Plus, you do have to repair wooden framed barns quite often. You wouldn't have to worry about that for metal.<br>  <br>  I think it's a good idea =)|`|GbtRPEuxaa	metal is nice  but if you have metal stalls and a horse gets cast or tangled up its easier to take wood apart in a hurry than metal wood has give and metals wire bars don't give we always evaluate every situation we put are horses in and try to look for all possible wrecks and all possible outs and the worse possible scenario  just something about wood and horses go together and metal just doesn't have outs that i like like a lot of injury's have metal involved  like i wood rather have a broken wooden fence instead of a tangled up horse in a metal one <br>  sheet metal is the worst it cuts like a razor <br>  well my wife says i am getting carried away so metal out side wood inside|`|BiUNuyfFaa	Yea. Um.. I have a metal barn it isn't all metal though (that would just overheat very easily.) Wood is more expensive but it lasts a lot longer and it looks a lot better.

Before we had that one of the horses tried to kick another and tore her ligament and tendon when she missed and kicked through the metal.  We really like the metal though. The horses dont chew it like wood, its cheaper,warm, pretty durable, and easier and cheaper to fix if needed. its very nice becasue we used to have a wood barn and the horses tore it up scratchin, chewing and kicking, and they havent done anything to the metal.<br>  <br>  However, if you live somewhere SUPER windy be careful. it gets windy here in kansas some, but if its very very windy it could tear your barn up depending on how well its built. but its not likely. just wanted to give you a con.|`|59964a018492ed365416a5a4322c2588aa	You can use rubber, I don't advise metal though.|`|B6zl0AJDaa	Brick or Concrete bricks work too, you use metal for the interior.

732c53bd23ec21418e9a02c0dff8ef43aa	You need to get her a hard chew toy that tastes good. A Kong is too soft. The more she likes the taste, the more vigorously she'll chew, and the quicker her teeth will loosen up. This will be beneficial even if she doesn't lose a single tooth, as it will make it easier for the vet to extract them with as little trauma as possible. I recommend a cured bone of the appropriate size for your dog - their teeth are made to chew this type of thing. Steer clear of rawhide, as dogs can choke on it, and it tends to be VERY processed.<br>  <br>  **UPDATE**<br>  Pigs ears are ok, but they have a lot of the same drawbacks as rawhide - they tend to be pretty processed, and once the dog has chewed on it for a while, it gets soft (you don't want this). Just get her a good real bone (cured with some stuff still on it) that she can get her mouth around. Other than that, Nylabone also makes some edible bones that are very hard and give your dog's teeth a real workout - think they're called "Healthy Edibles"|`|F08HDRvraa	Get some rawhide chews for her to chew on, and get a second opinion from another vet about the teeth pulling.  I have always had small dogs, peek a poo, cairn terriers, schnauzers, shih-tzu and have never had to have a tooth pulled.  Also, I don't have much faith in Banfield - they are expensive and if you live in a city, I'm sure you can find a better and less expensive vet to use.|`|3zv2bbolaa	Try a rounded knuckle bone for her to chew on.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Tug!!  Go get one of those super plushy tug toys and get her tugging!!|`|mVt8soGwaa	Since you already go to PETSMART to the vet for your dog then go back to the store as they have a section there for puppies. They have toys, collars, etc. Look in that section as they have various toys to help puppies that are teething from various hard toys to ones that you can wet and freeze in the freezer. It may help to get a few of these toys to try and help her loose her baby teeth. Good luck!|`|Ti9WkcoAaa	just give her some dog biscuits. The bircuits hardness should help the teeth fallout. one other thing, dogs usually swallow there baby teeth.

When my vet spayed my rescued Pit he removed her puppy teeth for free.  <br>  <br>  Anyway, your first answer is a good one.  Tug toys.  It will help get those teeth out of there.  <br>  <br>  And you might check around with other vets.  Yours sounds a bit greedy.
C5YBD3F1aa	They are only about 1 month (don't want to do the math right now) and they shouldn't leave until 8-14 weeks. Whenever you separate them from their mother at 6 weeks old, all you do is cause a ton of issues for the dog in the future. In their last few weeks of time with their litter mates, they learn bite inhibition. This means that they learn to not bite too hard, when to stop playing, etc. Whenever a puppy yelps and screams when the other puppy is biting too hard, the other puppy learns to ease up and be gentle. This is something that almost all litters of BYB puppies suffer, because they are simply given away too early. Keep them as long as possible, 14 weeks at the most though, and socialize with them a LOT. If they bite too hard, make the loudest, most puppy-sounding yelp you can and immediately stop playing and leave the area. This teaches them not to teeth on people, and that when you are playing you must be gentle. Oh, and another thing, don't let them chew on you during play, such as chewing on fingers, pulling on clothes, yanking your hair, etc. This is one of the worst things you can do. Always use toys to play, that is what they are made for.<br>  <br>  The puppies are probably ready to start being weaned. Buy some canned soft puppy food, make sure it is a good brand, not anything like Ol' Roy or IAMS, try going for something more along the lines of Royal Kanine or Canidae. Get the highest quality food possible, because at this stage is whenever the most growth will start developing, and poor quality foods means less brain development and less growth. <br>  <br>  Whenever your puppies are 6-7 weeks old, take them into the vet and get them their first vaccinations. Don't buy any from a feedstore or anything, those aren't affective and usually just cause issues with the puppies. Have the vet administer them, don't do it yourself. Also have him worm the puppies, using a liquid puppy dewormer or whatever he thinks is best.<br>  <br>  Slowly introduce the soft puppy food, and at about 8-10 weeks old (if they are a small breed, such as Chihuahuas or Pomeranians wait until 11-12 weeks, if they are a medium breed such as Australian Shepherds or Australian Cattle dogs wait until they are 7-8 weeks, and if they are a large breed such as Bloodhound or Mastiffs wait until 9-10 weeks.) you can start them on hard puppy kibble, and again, buy the highest quality food you can. This is an important stage of their life. And make sure that you get the breed-size-appropriate puppy food, and make sure that it isn't for adult or senior dogs. Keep them until 14 weeks old if possible, that way they are completely adjusted to the solid dog food and are ready to eat it for life. <br>  <br>  If possible, take the puppies whenever they are 8 weeks old to a dog park or just a dog-friendly park, and set up a small exercise pen large enough for them to frolic in, and let people come up and pet them and pick them up and let any strange (BUT FRIENDLY) dogs check them out. This will give them a lot of socialization. Try to do this as much as possible. You want these puppies to grow up to be as friendly as possible!<br>  <br>  Good luck with the litter, and PLEASE get your female spayed in about 2 months so you don't have to go through this expensive process again, and so your female doesn't either!|`|3giaPYe8aa	No, you can't find new homes for the pups until they are 8 weeks old.  You need to buy some quality puppy food, soak it in warm water until it gets soft, and then mash it up to make a gruel.  With each week, up until they are 8 weeks, add less water, don't mash it to finely (leave it lumpy), until you are adding no water and they are eating it dry, on their own.  Always provide fresh water.  When you start to feed the pups this *mush*, let them feed by themselves....meaning, keep the Mom away from them while they are eating.|`|JsBb732Maa	It's a very sure sign that you need to feed them puppy food, wet it first and leave some out dry and they will watch their Dam and copy her eating the food.

You have to do the responsible thing and wean them. Clearly the dam is already trying to do that.<br>  <br>  Buy some *decent quality* puppy food, and soften it in warm water. Separate the mother and offer the food to the puppies.<br>  <br>  You WILL need to give them their first vaccinations/worming (contact your vet), and you WILL need to keep them until they are 8 weeks old.|`|xYsCC5UXaa	buy puppy food, and keep them for another four weeks.<br>  then get the mother spayed, whatever other dogs you have, and adopt the dogs out with a spay/neuter contract.<br>  THEN get a mentor, wait a couple of years while you learn the facts of breeding -- then think about breeding dogs.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Right now, the puppies are just barely over 4 weeks.  If mom is not feeding them anymore, you sure as heck need to be feeding them.  Get them on some good quality food now and plan on doing this for at least another 4 weeks.<br>  <br>  Then get your female fixed.  You want to go through this again?<br>  <br>  Oh good grief.|`|3zv2bbolaa	You should have started the weaning process around 3.5 - 4 weeks of age. By six weeks they need to be eating on their own with the limited time nursing on the dam who is trying to wean them completely at this age. <br>  <br>  You MUST NOT let puppies leave the litter until at least eight weeks of age, better to wait until ten weeks.|`|16XpYCBmaa	The mother has weaned the puppies off her and she is prolly sore from the sucking on her. When my dog had puppies she stopped feeding them around 3 weeks so I had to bottle feed them a little bit. You can start them on some canned puppy food because that will be easier for them to eat since they are so young yet, and then maybe try and add some dry food in with but soak it in some puppy milk or water. They are too young to be away from there mother I would wait until at least about 8 weeks old.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	They need to be eating puppy food three times a day by now,and the mom needs to be spayed.The puppies should stay with her for about two or three more weeks and they need at least one set of puppy shots and a few wormings.You should not just "give" the pups away,as you have no idea what will happen to them.You want to ask at least $25.00 per puppy to cover the cost of shots and worming.Also ask for vet references and PLEASE get the mother dog fixed within the next two months!!<br>  <br>  Edit: The pups are 5 weeks old today,people. Do the math. They can easily eat dry puppy food with a little warm water on it. They do not need mush or formula.|`|EeJMITyCaa	Your dog wont feed the pups because she knows that you should've started introducing them to food at week 3-4. You need to buy them puppy food. If they haven't been eating puppy food then you can't give them away. They really shouldn't be given away till 8 weeks anyway. What you need to do is get some good quality food (no food that is found at a walmart, grocery store, or dollar store.) A good quality puppy good has a meat as the first two product. "Meat by product" does not count. You then need to mix that puppy food with warm water and mix it up and let the pups have that.

Talk to a vet and ask about puppy formula.|`|ard3L0hHaa	It's time for puppy food.  Think of it this way, the babies are ready for baby food.  These puppies are the equivalent of a 6 month old baby.  They are ready for more variety than mother's milk, not ready for steak yet.  DO NOT SEPARATE THE PUPS AND MOM UNTIL 8 WEEKS OF AGE.  Ever.  Some breeds actually need more time to develop mentally and emotionally.  <br>  <br>  Many people with a new litter of puppies are unsure of how to start the weaning process. In fact, some do not even really understand what weaning means or implies. Weaning refers to the process of the puppies beginning to eat food other than mothers' milk or milk formula. There is no magic trick in weaning puppies; most do this naturally. <br>  A female dog is capable of supplying milk to her offspring for several months. In the wild, pups will be born in the spring and may (in some situations) still be nursing from their mother as the fall season arrives. They will definitely be taking food from other sources, but the mother will still be producing milk. The signal for the mammary glands to continue to produce milk is nursing or manipulation of the glands. Following whelping, if someone massages the mammary glands, they will continue to produce milk, even if the pups are taken away.<br>  <br>  In today’s world, weaning is not done to aid the mother. Rather, it is done because puppies generally make their way to their new home at about seven weeks of age, and since their mother is not going with them, the pups need to have their gastrointestinal tracts accustomed to eating commercially prepared foods. In most kennels, puppies get the first taste of food other than Mom’s milk at about 3? weeks of age. This may seem early to you, but after working with numerous breeders and seeing many litters raised in our own homes, we can guarantee that the puppies of any breed can take food on their own at this age. To make a puppy mush, we stay with the same brand of food the mother is fed, selecting the company’s dry puppy food. Prepare the puppy mush by placing 2 cups of high quality dry puppy food in a blender with 12.5 oz liquid puppy milk replacer and fill the rest of the blender with hot water. This should be blenderized until the consistency of human infant cereal. (This feeds 6-8 puppies of a medium-sized breed.) The puppies should receive 3-4 meals a day of this to start. Once the puppies have checked it out, walked in it, and have eaten some, the dam can be allowed to finish it and clean the puppies off. Each week, increase the amount of food, decrease the amount of the milk replacer and water that is added, and the time of blenderizing, so by 7 weeks, the puppies are eating dry food.Once they are on dry food, it may be left in with the puppies (when the dam is out of the box) or the meal times can continue. As the puppies eat more solid food, the ***** may be let away from the puppies for an even longer period of time. By the time they are 6?-7 weeks, they should be fully weaned from the dam's milk, eating dry food, and drinking water.<br>  <br>  If the weaning is not rushed, the b*tch will naturally start decreasing milk production as the puppies increase their intake of solid food. As the puppies begin eating the puppy mush at 4 weeks of age, start changing the b*tch's diet back to adult food to also help her decrease milk production. Start by replacing 1/4 of her puppy food with adult food. Keep increasing the adult food and decreasing the puppy food until by the 8th week postpartum, she is eating only adult food. During the last week of weaning, the dam's food consumption should be less than 50% above the maintenance levels and declining toward maintenance levels.|`|sTBmQoVYaa	Way too soon to re-home pups.  My dog had more pups than teats and I've always used a mixture of goats milk and water to wean or bottlefeed any that get left out.  Best quality puppy food should be introduced slowly so that they get the best start.  Pups can go after 8wks, many dont go until ten or 12 wks, depends on breeder.

Place it on an area higher than that of the aquarium, to prevent water from back-siphoning, or install a check valve, if you're going to place it lower than the waterline. Placing it in a higher area is recommended, as water may siphon into the pump, causing an electrical shock/yhazard.|`|H9Nvo2gxaa	No fish can go in a 1 gallon tank.|`|eyTeCXEJaa	By assembling it;<br>  It goes into the air pump section.

At the age of 2 weeks onwards baby budgies peck around their nestbox looking to find food and experiment with feeding off the floor around them. They will peck at the seed when hungry. No real need to panic as at 4-5 weeks is fledging age anyway...when they come out of their nests...so mum is trying to wean them and get them to be independant. If they are out of the nest, scatter seed on the floor of the cage for them to find.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	I would tend to think it's safe to feed the birds some nutritious baby food, like Gerber's.

4SQx8smEaa	Let it go Renee...the snakes HAVE to eat...I know it is a harsh reality and I do not like it anymore than you but.....<br>  I was told you can just freeze them, its like they just fall asleep, and does not hurt. I don't know how true this is, I could not imagine freezing to death.<br>  And when I worked at the pet shop the one guy who would purchase feeder rats for his snake would kill them by holding the rat by its tail and hitting it hard against the building....eh it makes me sick just talking about it. I would not suggest that form or termination.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I did not say it was humane...I do not think you read the part where I said...<br>  "I don't know how true this is, I could not imagine freezing to death"<br>  <br>  I agree with the CO2 being the most humane way.|`|McnuekTBaa	Try this:<br>  Pin the rat's neck to a firm surface, such as a table, using a screwdriver. Pull sharply back on the tail. This is called cervical dislocation, and it is easy, fast, humane, instant, and bloodless.<br>  Wacking them on the head doesn't always kill them, and they often bleed heavily.<br>  <br>  I used to breed mice, and I have raised and killed thousands of them this way.|`|EDOxXdcoaa	Fill a deep aquarium or bucket half full with CO2. You can buy CO2 in gaseous form in tanks or in dry form as dry ice. You would then put the animal(s) in the tank/bucket and they will immediately be knocked out and killed in just a few minutes. Afterwards you can then feed them off or freeze them. Make sure you put the tank/bucket outside after you're finished so that the gas can dissipate. Hope it helps.<br>  <br>  <br>  *Edit to add*<br>  A rodent freezing to death is no different than you or I freezing to death. It's not as simple as falling asleep. It's a slow and painful process and I wouldn't recommend this to anyone as a means of "humanely" euthanizing an animal.<br>  <br>  Holding them by the tail and whacking them against a solid surface is also far from "humane". Sure, you might get lucky and a rat would die instantly from the impact or perhaps go into cardiac arrest from the terror involved but more often you'd have a severely injured rat that writhes on the floor while hemorrhaging to death. <br>  <br>  Here's a very informative link on how to use CO2 for this purpose:  <a href="http://www.ball-pythons.net/forums/showthread.php?t=33850" rel="nofollow">http://www.ball-pythons.net/forums/showt...</a>|`|O6kb5vVcaa	You might need a tough stomach to do this and nerves of ...

We're all against animal abuse.|`|zlVqLur4aa	The CO2 or cervical dislocation methods are your two humane choices. There is nothing humane about suffering blunt force trauma to the head and jaw or freezing to death. I'm not sure what an animal's rapid reproductive rate has to do with it somehow not deserving as humane a death as possible. I also worked in the exotic retail trade for years and we fed our snakes frozen/thawed, just as we advised our customers to do. All of our snakes were guaranteed to feed on  F/T. Our hobby is often judged by how feeder animals are treated.<br>  <br>  For those who believe that whacking something against a wall is quick and humane then how would you react to your vet euthanizing your cat, dog, boa or bearded dragon with that method?|`|TxhYMSEAaa	Well my honest opinion is to stun them.. I work at a local pet store and to be completely honest even though it may not seem humane its what we do to feed our snakes. Grab em by the tail and hit em on a ledge of some sort or even against a wall... and to all the people who say its so wrong.. you need to think of how fast these rodents multiply.. QUICK!! If it weren't for snakes and other animals eating them.. there would be rats and mice EVERYWHERE!!  I own 2 snakes of my own an 11 yr old ball python and a 4 yr old corn snake.. although I do mostly feed them live (and no that doesnt technically make them aggressive) I have had to stun the mice and rats if they are too aggressive for the snake.. but honestly.. either go with the gas stuff that person was talkin about or just do it the realistic simple way.. its just a mouse for crying out loud!! Hope it all works out for you!|`|B7zYuFy6aa	I have to agree with the 'stun em' guy. I feed live to my snakes, yeah I know frozen is better and bleeding hearts will freak out, but I stun them the same way. I smack them on the wall and the snake hits it fast. The mouse/rat knows nothing and the snake has live food to eat. The place that we have here for frozen mice/rats freezes them fast while they are still alive.|`|yr8ifPFlaa	<a href="http://www.alysion.org/euthanasia/" rel="nofollow">http://www.alysion.org/euthanasia/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.rodentracks.com/DIY_Co2_Chamber.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.rodentracks.com/DIY_Co2_Chamb...</a>|`|NpfLcG92aa	put them in a bag and throw them in the freezer

If you can't afford to take her to a vet, look up low cost or free vets in your area. Just google it. Also, don't have food available to her at all times. Cats are gluttons and will just keep eating and eating and get fat, neither of which are healthy for them. It could just be all the food she is eating, but better safe than sorry and get her checked out and tested for things like worms, FIV and feline leukemia.
Ei85kgfdaa	visit the breed club website for reputable breeder referrals. The pups must be at least 8 weeks before they can go home and you will be able to meet the mother but its not common for the father to be owned by the breeder as they have to choose a stud that compliments their female in pedigree, conformation and temperament so its unlikely they will have that perfect male in their own home.

You should never do a 100% water change. All aquariums should be cycled before adding fish. This means that the tank should have been allowed to accumulate beneficial bacteria that breaks down fish waste. This bacteria lives in the substrate and filter media. Without cycling first you subject the fish to dangerous levels of ammonia.    You should be performing 25% partial water changes weekly.    What sort of loach do you have?|`|Fx9bxZ8aaa	if you have a filter you will still have to do water changes,the only diffrence is that they will be smaller.it's okay if you do complete water changes to goldfish.it is not safe with tropicals.every 2 weeks yopu can do 50% water changes.|`|DlEwI1XPaa	u dont|`|pSofPy05aa	As stated above as the tank has not been cycled i would change 10% of the water every other day to try and keep you chemicals in balance once you have a filter i would personally do 10% water changes every 4 days just from experience. It is a lot less stressful for the fish and the tank if you do more regular small changes rather than occasional large changes. You shouldn't do much More than a 25% water change other than in an emergency. However you tank being relatively large i expect you will get away without cycling i would just wait until at least three weeks after you have added the filter until i would add more fish. Also be sure that you use dechlorinator or use 'water ager' as this will remove the more harmful chemicals from tap water.    P.S good luck with a great hobby, remember the most important thing with fish is to remember 'patience is a virtue'. You are quite literally crating their whole ecosystem. Look after it and you will reap the rewards for many years to come
Z0v6G0Kgaa	Most folks new to agility think that building an agility course or creating obstacles will be a good workout for their dog.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  For starters, most dogs don't really enjoy doing the obstacles per se.  My dog LOVES agility.  I have a backyard full of obstacles (right now, 12 weaves, a tire, 7 jumps and a teeter) and he avoids all of them (even if they're right in his path) unless I tell him to do the obstacle.  Dogs do NOT enjoy doing the obstacles.    What dogs like about agility is:  --working with their human (the relationship and teamwork thing)  --the mental challenge.    Case in point:  we go to an AKC trial.  In one entire day there (arrive at 7:30am, leave at 5pm, onsite the entire time), my dog will leave incredibly tired.  He'll sleep all the way home in the car, at home once we get there, won't show much energy for a day.  And he's in great shape too:  when we aren't snowed in, he gets a minimum of 120 minutes of walks every day, we do agility practice every day, I do tricks and obedience work in the house every day, we go running for 1-2 miles 3x a week and we also play fetch or set up doggie play-dates.  He's in great shape.  But agility tires him out.  And here's the deal:  at an AKC trial in one day, he'll do 2 runs, each of about 30-40 seconds.  That's it.      It's not the physical workout that tires the dog.  It's the mental workout, the recognition that "it's my job" and the concentration as well as the environmental pressures (100 barking BCs and Shelties, new environment, new equipment).    So start by taking a class.  YOu can find a club or trainer by going to www.agilityevents.net, find a trial near you, go and ask participants "who would you recommend near me?".  Contrary to the previous post, Clean Run magazine does not post a list of trainers.  They do have info on their website but they admit it's out of date and most trainers don't advertise or have websites.    Additionally, before you actually start doing obstacles there are a bunch of things you should master:  --dog's growth plates should have all closed.  This is between 10 months and 18 months depending upon the breed of dog.  --you've got a good down-stay, sit-stay, recall and heel (basic obedience) that is very reliable.  Because agility is done "naked" meaning no leash or collar.  --you've worked with your dog on contacts before they get on any obstacle (otherwise you're training bad habits)  --you've done circle-work or flat-work (basically agility without obstacles) so you know how to do a front-cross and rear-cross.    Get Joe and Ali Canova's book on agility--it's the best intro book out there.  The ones by Laurie Leach and Margaret Bonham aren't bad either (but not as good as Joe and Ali's).  There are a couple of good foundation skill building DVD's--I'm partial to Jenny Damm but Grey Derrett is immensely popular.  And take an intro class.  Even if you don't intend to compete and don't mean to take this seriously, an intro class is essential.  Most beginners do things that confuse dogs, provide conflicting cues and make agility a pain for the dog by destroying drive.  Take an intro class and everything will go much better.    How to build a course?  Well, if you're not interested in competing, you don't really need to know what an agility course is officially like.  All you really need are some boxes or bales of hay for your dog to go around or climb up on or create an obstacle course, maybe a kid's play tunnel from JC Penney.  Seriously--if you're not planning on competing, don't spend extra money to buy/make equipment that requires specific technique on.  Instead, just get safe stuff for your dug to run through, over or around and boxes and haybales are all cheap, useable or recyclable and safe.    But if you want to actually do agility, you can build 85% of what you need out of PVC.  You'll have a variety of jumps (broad, spread, winged), a tire, PVC for a base for a dog walk and teeter, an A-frame and weaves (made out of PVC).  Get the "agility in a bag" from AffordableAgility and you'll have a model to copy.  Or get the book "Do it yourself agility equipment" by Jim Hutchins--I used that book to make my A-frame.|`|AE7W7Jspaa	before you take the time and effort to try and build equipment.  Learn a little about the sport, there is alot more that goes into it than simply jumping your dog or running them over obsticles.  Your dog and you have to understand how to safely negotiate the obsticles out there.  There are alot of great books and a couple of good websites out there for people interested in getting started in agility.  Yahoo also has a group that has instructions or tips on how to build safe equipment|`|uQrIdrjfaa	y|`|t5tRvpnbaa	google it.|`|ixFbNr4taa	You actually have to take a class to understand exactly what you are doing in order to teach your dog.  The equipment is large, heavy and expensive.  There are PVC designs to build substitute equipment but you still need a lot of space.     Beside the equipment -- you need to learn how to teach your dog -- get an experienced instructor and you'll have a blast.  It is important to understand the theory behind agility in order to make it a safe sport for your dog.  The best trainers start you out on an agility foundation class -- you don't even get to do the agility obstacles that you see on TV - it is a combination of groundwork, jump chutes, sit/stays, single jump work and target training.  Dogs also need to be at least a year old (if not older) to ensure that their growth plates have fully formed.  Then when you do start jumping - it is a Very low height (like 4 inches for a dog who is 12 inches at the shoulder), and it is fun, fun & fun.  No stress, only positive reinforcement and happy times!!    Go to Clean Run magazine -- they have a section where you can look up agility trainers in your local area.  GOOD LUCK - Have fun in class!!!
W02kTOqmaa	No dog. Dogs are pack animals and leaving them outside is mental cruelty. They become VERY depressed and destructive. No matter how much you try, you will not spend nearly as much time outside with your dog as you would if your dog lived inside with you.    They are not psychologically meant to live alone.|`|9ea79964f4ddad1359a8089c6729bb4caa	Several breeds could live outside, but they ALL require plenty of exercise, socialization, grooming, etc. If your parents are so worried about messes and such, I'd be concerned that they aren't going to be willing to put the time necessary into the dog. Who is going to go out and spend some time with the dog in the middle of winter when it's freezing outside? And who is going to walk the dog and exercise the dog when there is snow on the ground? These are all things that need to be determined long before you even think about what breed.|`|uQrIdrjfaa	none ur rents r mean
4SQx8smEaa	That is a habit that the dog acquired that you are going to have to break, you are going to need to train him not to pee in the house. Getting a dog fixed does not magically train him.|`|PM23RDycaa	NOPE. Training however will.    Neutering is not a cure all for all problems. At 2 yrs old he is used to marking his territory. You have to train him that marking/going in the house is UNACCEPTABLE|`|W0buucLsaa	Yes, it will.|`|uQrIdrjfaa	ya|`|iU2fQBtRaa	yes, and keep him away from male dogs and male dog scent (if you can) until you fix him.

Getting a dog fixed is just so they can't get another dog pregnant and be a baby daddy.  It has nothing to do with urination.  The only thing that's going to change that is training him.  Yelling at him when he does it and then putting him outside afterward.  Praising him when he does go outside.
DhE0rEWiaa	Yes it is, dogs by law in Calif now how to be in some type of seat belt, and even if it were not why would you even want to do that, do you not know you are at a higher risk of causing a car accident not to mention killing your dog if your air bag went off. If your going to drive be a safe driver and put your dog in a proper seat belt not on your lap.    EDIT, You asked the question we do not know if you do that, you did not state if you did or did not so the question was answered the way you asked it.|`|76nTvO4iaa	I live in Texas.    I had my beagle on my lap a couple of years ago & a police officer pulled me over.    He asked me what my dog's name was.  I told him.  He asked me if she had a learner's permit.  I told him she didn't.  He told me if she didn't have a learner's permit, she had no business behind the wheel of the car.    He then told her to get off my lap - and she did and gave him a dirty look.    He laughed and told me it was dangerous for both the dog and me to drive that way.  I told him I knew and would watch it in the future.    I don't know if it's against the law, but it's not smart or safe.|`|PM23RDycaa	Don't know but personally the safest place for a dog is in a crate int he backseat.|`|uQrIdrjfaa	ya|`|d64ac7bde0d47e04d090bc8ecedcc3a1aa	Legal or not, why would you want to endanger your dog that way?

He would also be able to take his own poop bags along and clean up his messes too!    Actually, he could clean up our back yard, take his own bath instead of paying a groomer, drive to his vet appointments, etc. etc.  HEE HEE|`|26PPwzrWaa	I have no idea for my dogs.

Is there any construction going on in your neighborhood or might there have been some kind of shooting or explosion that she may have confused for an in-house noise?  Or maybe you've taken on an unexpected visitor (mouse, opossum, etc.) that she spotted inside that doesn't belong there?    The fact that she FLEW out of the house says that something happened that she believes came from inside the house.|`|ToeeUGZUaa	You should get a flashlight and look around. She could of eaten something that she shouldn't of had. You might want to take her to a vet to make sure. Also, she could of euronated or pooped somewhere.|`|tu9eTMPRaa	I hate to answer your question with more questions, but is she a little dog? Also, how long have you had her? Have you ever observed this behavior before? Is there something different about this day? Was there thunder or something new?   If she's a small breed of dog, the shaking and flinching and fidgeting might have something to do with the breed itself. Small breeds of dogs tend to be more high strung and easily frightened.   Honestly, it's probably nothing. The most likely answer is that she's probably just frightened by something. If it keeps happening and its that worrisome to you, or if she starts destroying things or nipping (some dogs can become aggressive when they're afraid) you should call your veterinarian and see if she can refer you to an animal behaviorist.|`|096a9ebdbf46f3c4aeeeb0edbab45753aa	Is there any symptoms like high fever, dullness, loss of appetite, coughing, vomiting, diarrhoea,fits,shaking heads...etc... I would suggest you to consult a vet immediately.
YKwXhGtkaa	Since you said drift wood...check out some anubias.  Will easily attach to driftwood and require low-moderate light.  Consider ungrading your light, whether you spend some bucks, or do it the cheap way, it would greatly increase the variety of plants to choose from as well as just make them grow much better.|`|AA11799177	arrowhead philadendrons
Uy79dKEmaa	It is quite possible that the food is going bad, especially if it's a "natural" food with no preservatives.  I have a couple of suggestions for you.    It sounds like you put down the whole can of food and then pick it up later for refrigeration.  You should only put down 1/2 the can and immediately cover and refrigerate the rest.  This will minimize the length of time it is exposed after being opened.  Then, when it is time for her next meal, don't take the food beforehand.  Just pop it in the microwave for about 10 seconds to take the chill off.  Again, this will minimize the exposure.    My other suggestion is to purchase smaller cans so that you open a fresh one at every meal.    Hope this helps!|`|0accd20a753414614a02981356511fc6aa	You are feeding your cat too much, give her half as much. If she has dry food available to nibble on, she is fine. I have cat food covers that I use to seal after opening, Do not refrigerate as long as no air get into the food its good. Try this for a while, you won't waste the food any more caused by over feeding. Good Luck

2IOFXmQ2aa	Short-snouted breeds often have terrible gas problems.  I have a Boxer and a Boston Terrier, fed on Nutro Rice & Lamb and Iams Small Breed respectively, and they let loose some whoppers!    My mom picked up this tip from a boxer web page and message forum:  put a tablespoon or so of *plain* (vanilla is okay in small amounts) yogurt onto your dog's food.  You can mix it in if you wish, but I just plunk a dollop of it on top of their kibble.    Neither I nor my mom know the specific mechanisms of this, but we both swear by this technique.|`|1b013cc3fe2d25b057fd14f52569f85caa	many breeds, including pugs eat fast and take in a lot of air when they eat.    my Cane Corso is the same way, little can be done    one thing that helped is I elevated his food bowl so he doesn't have to bend down to eat.    one other thing...    Pugs have large anal glands, you may need to get them cleaned.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Try Natural Balance or Blue Buffalo,  they are what I feed & both helped my dog with gas.

o93EwErKaa	The shampoo helps not to irritate the skin when bathing, but true itch relief is going to be better using oatmeal.  Don't buy the minute oats, buy the original ones, preferably organic.  Put in a blender and turn into a fine powder - now you have colloidal oatmeal.  Add 3 cups to a lukewarm bath (never hot) and pour over your dog for 15 minutes.  Pat dry, never rub.  Here is a link with any details I am forgetting.    Basically, it is the same stuff our parents soaked us in the tub with when we had chicken pox.    http://www.colloidaloatmeal.com/    This fur butter is really great stuff too because it has colloidal oatmeal and aloe vera, calendula and some other good natural things to help itchy skin.    http://www.happytailsspa.com/Fur-Butter?...|`|tPGxPDvBaa	you use a good quality oatmeal based shampoo then leave on for 5min & rinse.  Oatmeal only works for dry skin or if your dog had a allergic reaction etc that needs soothing.  Just scratching might not need oatmeal.|`|uIvb5eqoaa	Well obviously you don't use actual oatmeal.  The best stuff you can get is from the vet.  It is expensive and I think the brand name is Relief. It is a white bottle with green text on it.  With that kind, you wet your dog and coat them with this shampoo.  You let them baste in it for 10 minutes, then rinse.  Don't put anything extra on them.|`|gwUMipsUaa	Turn water on to a warm temp, close the drain, and start washing with the shampoo.    Edit: I know it's for your dog.  You bathe the dog with oatmeal shampoo like you would any other dog shampoo.

OKiMkaxGaa	Well they have to test it, but as far as cruelty goes, they aren't too bad. Run from Iams though, they suck.    Just a note, though Purina isn't necessarily cruel, their food is pretty low quality. Consider getting a better food for your pets and improve their health and nutrition.|`|8NSh1D4Maa	All pet foods are 'animal tested' to get their AAFCO approval   It is a requirement that feeding trials be conducted.  However, Purina's food is total and complete crap.  They spend their revenue on advertising, not producing a quality food for your pets.  Look for the following in a quality pet food:  no wheat, corn, or soy products.  no byproducts or non-specific ingredients (like 'meat meal' or 'animal digest').  no artificial coloring or artificial preservatives.  The first ingredient listed and one more of the first 5 should be a named meat product.

AA10112346	How many times do you feed a puppy per day?  3 times   How about like over 1yr old maltese?  2 times   Do they eat a lot?  depends if food is high quality. the better the less.Good food is like 20 bucks for a 6 pound bag. 6 pounds lasts about 2 weeks so 40 dollars per month. [look into the dog food Wellness {sold at petco}]  How much does the grooming cost?   Not sure..ask at PETCO or something.Puppy cut.. ask them  Im planning to stick with the puppy cut for my maltese b/c I like that look better so how much is it to get a dog hair cut?  Um i would say the short hair one. so puppy  How much is the vet fee for the first year for the puppy?  roughly..? about 1K[remember spay/neuter]  How much will the vet fee be after 1yrs old?  depends on how often it gets sick.. heartworm preventive..flea preventive..ect..like check ups.. stool checks....  How many times should I bathe my dog? (Other than when it jumps in a puddle or something) umm. not sure google it. or go here : http://www.akc.org/breeds/maltese/index....|`|sNDQCpZsaa	Maltese are great dogs, but sometimes they tend to have an attitude, and get spoiled easily. If you want to pick a good, calm dog, you can always try the check technique. Hold up the dog on its back, and if it wiggles a lot, and won't let you pet it, it won't be a great dog. Maltese also get horrible tear stains under their eyes, so washing them every 2 weeks is the most you can wait. Since its a small dog, the bill will be about $30-$40, depending where you go. I hope this helps you!

AA11443269	Figure on when the dog is full grown, unless you want to buy multiple crates. Think of the full size dog, measure it and estimate the weight, each crate brand is different   Most will say for this breed or that, but if you take the length of the grown dog and add about 50% that usually covers it. Too much room and they have a tendency to be bounced around, too little room and it is hard to move, bur remember they like it snug.      Many time (I did) left the kennel door open and used it as an end table. My dog used it whenever he wanted to lie down. It was his own personal place, he was out of the way and when he needed to be locked away it was there and ready.    Get the dog used to the kennel while she is young; get her to know that is her place. Never use the kennel as a punishment tool! While driving in the car always put the dog in its kennel.    Without the breed of the dog its just impossible to even guess on size.|`|AA10112346	Make it big enought fo him to stand up and lie down confortably. Not enough to soil it though.

We used to feed our dogs that and it was a very good quality food, but they moved plants (to one where the previous tenant was a manufacturer that used the chinese wheat glutton in their food) and they also switched recipes and added barley (which can't be digested by dogs, and most have an allergic reaction to).  I guess it's a cheap filler or something.  Our dogs lost weight, got very itchy, and lost fur.  As soon as we switched food everything improved.  We switched to Before Grain.  I also use Nutro Ultra for my other dogs.  Blue Buffalo is another good brand.  Even though she acts like a puppy, she's old enough for adult food.  And if you think that she needs food for sensitive stomachs then buy it, it can't hurt.

Both shepherd and lab have good energy, teeth, glistening coat, correct weight, and overall good health. I know this may sound surprising (it is still surprising to me).  I have included a link to an article on basic dog nutrition that I thought had some good things to say.  I hope it helps.
PM23RDycaa	He ran away because he was unsupervised and saw his chance to make a break for it.    Dogs are highly adaptable as for missing you *shrugs* hard to say. Start fresh in the morning but keep an eye out for him. In the morning take pics of him around to the local vets and shelter and let them know he got out the night before.

A lot of time the police will be notified if a stray dog is spotted in the area.  Start making a poster to put up around the area tomorrow and look up the numbers of all the vet office around to also let them know your dog is missing.  The more people who know your dog is missing the better your chances are of getting him back.  Offer a reward for the safe return of the dog too.  Another reason why you should never leave your dog outside unsupervised for a long period of time.|`|AA11228933	That sucks. I try not to ever let that happen to my dog but when it did I used the sounds of things he likes to make him return. I once got out a bag of weiners and crumpled the bag over and over outside the door to have him come from down the street at night to get his treat! It's better at night due to the quiet.  Rattle your house keys. Or start your vehicle. My dog comes because he thinks he's going for a car ride and keys or starting up are an audible signal to him.  Good luck and don't worry my dog is a Lab mix and they're smart and loyal too. Be kind when he returns so he won't fear coming back if there is a next time. Let's hope there won't be a next time shall we?|`|oiBGMHcBaa	I am so sorry.  Please call local pounds and shelters do notify you if they get any lab mix. Also call the police.  Does your dog know well your neighborhood?  Did he had any tags?  Put flyer's around your neighborhood.  If I would you I would knock on every house asking if they have seen a your dog. I suggest you to do it.  If you have a picture it would be alot better and you could show them a picture. Do not give up. I am going to tell you a story.    I had a dog that I left in my kitchen because I had to go to work. I had two dogs a Yorkie and a Pomeranian both of them were young. Both of them were about 5 months and they had cost a fortune. All together I spent 2,000 for them. When I came back I saw that one of my windows were cracked. I freaked out and went inside my home. That is when I saw I was robbed. I went over to my kitchen and saw that Nena(My Yorkie) and Chiquita(My Pomeranian) was missing. I did not care about my stuff  I cared about my babies. I called my husband and told him what happened. He came back home with our 3 month old baby girl. I started to cry. I went over to my neighbor and asked him if he had heard something or saw something. He told me" Well I did see a Chevrolet driving out of your drive way and I heard some dogs barking." I told him" Chiquita and Nena! Why didn't you go out?. He answered" I thought that was your husband.". We left his house and called the police and they told us they would start searching in 24 hours! I started to cry and was practically screaming at the officer. I received a call saying that if I wanted my dogs back that I had to pay them 500 dollars each or they would kill them. I had caller id and went to the internet and put the phone and got the address and went driving to the direction. My dogs were chained outside in the cold. I un-chained them and put them in my van.

jxtNodu2aa	I would use both, if your enclosure is big enough.  Have the heating pad in one corner, the heating lamp in another part, and have places where there is no heating things.  It's better when they are able to pick their own temperature, especially in a place like Ontario.  If the cage is not big enough, than use just the lamp to cast a heat source over the entire enclosure.|`|6j9EZXGWaa	You can use either one.

If they won't take to it right away, you can sprinkle something on top that they like, such as pieces of fruit, vegetables or maybe a dead cricket or a live wax worm or super worm. Another idea would be pouring a very small amount of flavor whether it be from cat food, cooked ground beef, etc. I would just offer a very small amou nt in the dish moistened daily.

He doesn't know they're get and he needs to become used to the taste. It's important to offer a variety in their diet. You didn't mention if it was a baby or adult? Babies need more protein to reach their full size and as they reach full size you can cut back on protein and rely more on veggies. You also didn't mention if he was new and what he has been eating. Answers to these questions will help if you have more questions,  Concerning diet, you should be offering him a little variety of fresh, chopped up greens daily. (Not lettuce = No nutrients) Greens that are high in calcium are Collard greens, Kale, Dandelion greens and Mustard greens. Vary these weekly. Add an orange or yellow veggie such as carrots, summersquash, summersquash. I use a potato peeler to shace thinly and then chop tiny. Never offer anything larger than the space inbetween the beardies eyes or you can cause spinal injuries.  Make enough of this veggie mix to last 3 days. A cup a day per beardie, as it will make less work. Keep it in a tupperware container with a lid and add a papertowel on top, to keep fresh.  If it's a small beardie use a low sided bowl about chest high. Put empty bowl in tank an hour after lights on. Slowly sprinkle veggies in bowl from a few inches above to attract him to the movement.   After adding veggies, slowly sprinkle a tablespoon of the dry bearded dragon pellets on top of the veggies in hops he will accidently eat a few and aquire a taste for them.  Fresh veggies are an important part of diet because they're nutritious, but they're also hydrating. Hydration is important to this semi-desert species because he may forget to drink and get dehydrated.  That's why misting babies every morning and every night a few hours before lights out is important.   You'll also need to teach him to drink from a bowl as well and that can be done with the same method as with veggies. And with this doet you should offer a juvenile beardie crickets atleast once a day, as much as they can eat in 5 minutes, for the 1st year. And after that atleast 3 times a week.   Dust the crickets lightly in a cup before feeding, twice a week with a multi-vitamin with D3. Also dust crickets once a week with calcium. I don't dust the veggies.   Hope that helps!|`|eSoU2C3Waa	just give it time, he will eventually eat them but if not just feed him crickets and veggies.

She is beautiful.. really really lovely like [:  Have fun with her!|`|zvqspfSCaa	well she is a beautiful mare. and she sounds like she will be an awesome jumper when you are finished with her. my best friend is a jumper and dressage champion on the east coast. she now lives on the west coast and hasnt been showing in the late. but she agrees that your horse sounds wonderful|`|C3btl9dTaa	beautiful horse.   i think with dressage (im a hopeless jumper lol). if you make her more round (on the bit), then that will help with your dressage in the way that she will look nicer and it makes her more focused.she is a warmblood so if she is rounder and more supple she will look fantastic.|`|f8b0aaad8207d631cdc448f606b81a58aa	I am a Quarter Horse type of girl so I can't judge your riding pics, but the first pic is cute. She looks like a sweet mare. Good luck with your dressage. Should be a fun challenge. :)|`|bI7wMCJXaa	The pictures aren't very good for judging much. Did you want to know about her confirmation? She looks like she's very downhill so dressage would be difficult for her, but that could be the angle making her butt look so high. She's also over in the knee. She's slightly behind the verticle in the second pictures and I can't tell if she's evading your hands because you're pulling on her mouth or if she's generally difficult getting her to seek the bit.    Over the jump, holy cow that's high! Other than her front knees being uneven (which I think is because she has her legs tucked up so high) she looks like she loves what she's doing.    To recondition your horse into dressage you need to ride like a dressage rider, and to do that you need a dressage trainer. Slowly you will earn your longer stirrups and elasticize and gymnasticize your horse and teach her to seek the bit. Before she'll do that she'll need you to ride with your seat and have quiet steady hands. If that's not something you're interested in just keep jumping. She does that very well.    Some horses are mentally in tune with doing dressage, others aren't. You can't force what isn't there. 2nd level is where a lot of horses in training start to get tight trying to do dressage because they don't like it.|`|0ESxOfdmaa	Very nice|`|01Zwn3GWaa	gorgeous confirmation, pretty head. She doesn't seem to jump very square, but then in jumpers that's not as important as long as she tucks well.  She looks pretty amazing!|`|lu4ufhm5aa	oooh. I want it :) Ive been riding western for 18 years so english is very new to me. But she is very pretty
8NSh1D4Maa	Ol' Roy is made especially for WalMart.  You can contact them.  However, it is likely your dogs are ill because you changed their food type or they have a sensitivity to the crappy ingredients in the Ol' Roy.  If you need a cheap dog food because of economic concerns, look into purchasing Kirkland Dog Food from Costco.  It is generally as cheap as Ol' Roy but MUCH better for your dogs, though still not the best out there.  If you have some extra funds but are just being a tightwad, this is not the area to scrimp and save, especially with a female nursing pups.  Get yourself a puppy food that's good quality like Solid Gold, Merrick, Wellness, Canidae, Innova, California Natural or similar.  I would be extremely surprised if your lactating female is able to produce an adequate milk supply and maintain a good weight while eating Ol' Roy, it's like feeding your kids the cheapest hot dogs on the market and nothing else and is incredibly nutritionally inadequate for a normal dog, let alone a lactating dog.|`|GTmkQzCgaa	Ol Roy is possibly the WORST food you couldbuy. It's mostly fillers and junk, and doesn't provide the right sort of nutrition a dog needs.    My sister's puppy got sick from eating it and needed a vet visit. SInce then she's been on Purina Puppy Chow, and been doing fine. The other dogs also have skin conditions caused by it.    I would reccomend going to PetSmart and asking the people that work there if it's on the recall list, or for an affordable option of a new dog food for your other dogs, and the mother with puppies.|`|AA11887983	If you changed the food suddenly, you may have inadvertantly caused the problem.  But Ol' Roy food is like feeding your kids solely ramen noodles.  There is a lot of junk in there, and when you get food that inexpensive, they usually don't give you a way to contact them!  That is one difference with the "expensive" foods.      Try to find out what the parent company is for Ol' Roy, and contact them.  And try to get your dogs onto a more quality controlled food.  It may also be a good idea to contact your vet, regarding if they have heard of any recent problems with that diet in your area, and for some advice on how to treat your dogs.     Good luck, and I hope you get in touch with them.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	They are more likely sick because you CHANGED than any other reason. My dog has eaten Ole Roy as long as we have had her, with no sickness.  You need to decide whether to stick with the new food (less expensive and just as healthy), or go back to the old food (implied as expensive, thus the switch).|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	Its probably from the sudden change in dog food, not the actual food you are feeding. They would have got sick no matter what you changed to.|`|SKvahrYOaa	my sisters dog died after she bought a bad of ol roy the vet said it was kidney failureand to late to be fixed, good luck tho
qu7DSLTqaa	They will learn to get along. Don't leave the new puppy alone (unsupervised) with the others until they've had time to learn to get along. When they seem to be getting along well, start slowly with leaving them alone in a room with you nearby. When your puppy is old enough, get him neutered-that will stop the mating game. (It's also a way dogs establish dominance...top dog is top dog kinda thing). Make sure the other 2 dogs get as much (or more) attention as before, so they aren't as jealous (they will still be jealous...).  Happy Birthday!! Keep us posted on how they get along!|`|4bc8eaa0884bcf0a2ac09d408dd8cd31aa	Jackson will grow out of it.  When dogs are introduced into a new environment, they try to establish themselves as the "alpha" dog, by mounting the other dogs.  This is what he is doing right now, and since Jack Russel's tend to be territorial, it might take him longer to stop this habit.  Try to help him understand that he is the new comer and he has to start at the bottom.|`|CJMhtM7maa	Happy birthday. Yes your other dogs will accept the new pup soon.If the older dogs are trying to mate with the pup,it's them trying to show dominance over the pup.That will stop soon.Are your other dogs neutered or spayed,if not it would be a good idea to have them all done.Just give them time,the older dogs will teach the pup their rules of play.Good Luck.|`|AA11171398	Use a squirt bottle to correct the humping. You will want the be careful because males can get "stuck" if you know what I mean and that could require vet attention if it gets serious.    The humping is them showing the pup who is boss. By touching them firmly and saying "no" you are also correcting the behavior.    Don't let them settle it on their own. I know 2 dogs who have lived together for 8 years now and still don't get along.
AA11171398	Crate Training!    Morning- let out of crate to go straight out to potty.  If he doesn't potty, put him back in for 10 minutes max and then let him straight back out.  Once he goes, feed him breakfast and put him back in his crate.  1 hour later let him straight out to potty.  Nothing, back in for 10 minutes.  Afterwards he can come into the house for play time.  Every hour during playtime, let him out where he is to potty.  Max playtime-3hrs or 1hr long walk  Right before going back into the crate, potty time.  Let him sleep.  Wake up- out to potty.  Nothing, back in for 10 minutes.  Come back in to eat lunch.  Wait 1 hr, then out to potty.  Nothing, comes in for 10.  Playtime/ long walk.  Potty walk every hour during play.  Back in for dinner.  Take away water for the night after eating.  Wait 1 hr, then out to potty.  A bit more play time before bed.  Last time out to potty should be as late as possible.     It is a lot, but trust me it will be worth it.|`|rcWPdgiYaa	If you don't have a yard to go in then you should walk him every 30 minutes or so just until you get his schedule down.  After he has a schedule you probably will only have to take him out a few times a day.  Just remember that every dog should have at least 45 minutes of good exercise a day!  Keep it up.|`|VwmaWcp9aa	The sites listed below may be able to help you.
eq5qPnRGaa	Usually vets don't test temperaments.  I've also never heard of temperament tests for horses.  They are done on dogs, but don't know what you're talking about with horses.    Usually a trainer or an experienced rider will evaluate temperament by working with the horse both on the ground and under saddle (if the horse can be ridden) they will be testing the horse on multiple facets in a bunch of informal tasks, and every rider/trainer will develop their own formula over time.  Some of the questions they may want to answer:    Does the horse throw a fit when you try to brush certain areas of his or her body?  Does the horse lead easily or is he pushy/aggressive?   How does the horse react to strange horses or people?  Is the horse easily frightened?  How does the horse react when frightened?  Will he stand tied forever or does he get impatient?  How athletic is he?  How athletic could he be?  Will he take advantage of inexperienced or timid riders?  Does he like to "argue" with his rider?  How hard will he try to please his rider/handler?  How does he handle frustration?  How good at problem solving is he?  Is he a fast learner?    There's also a huge training and handling component.  Most dogs have two or three owners over their lifetimes.  Horses often have five or more.  Some behaviors may be not so much the result of personality as training and handling.  So the person is always asking: Could the things I don't like about this horse be retrained, or are they personality traits?    There isn't a standard format for testing or a standard ideal result, because there is much more variation in what is desirable for horses than for dogs.  Acceptable and desireable traits vary enormously between competitive diciplines, rider experience levels, and rider temperment/preferences.      For example: I ride dressage and some trail, I've ridden for years, and I consider myself an assertive, but compassionate person.  I look for horses that are excellent problem solvers and quick learners.  I also hate horses that are spooky and bolt in the face of every threat.      Most of the horses that I find that have a good level head (they don't spook easily, and when they do they turn to face their fears and figure out what's out to get them) and are so smart also have a tendency to be stubborn and impatient.  They sometimes like to argue with me about how something ought to be done, figure out how to untie themselves or open doors and gates, or get miffed when I leave them waiting for a meal or standing in the cross-ties for longer than they'd expected.  As long as they object in a relatively good natured way so as not to be dangerous, and are willing to eventually at least try it my way, I'm willing to deal with the drawbacks, they are acceptable for my standards and purposes, but they may not be for someone else's.|`|bI7wMCJXaa	There is a group that adminisiters the ATT which is the American Temperament test. They put your dog through a series of challenges and gauges how your dog reacts.    To check for aggression towards animals stuffed animals will be used and when checking for food aggression the dog is typically given a bowl of food and a fake hand reaches in to touch their food.    In this first case this is a group that you pay to evaluate your dog, the second is something rescues and shelters do to determine adoptability. My vet(s) have never had cause to evaluate the temperament of my dogs. My last dog tried to bite her so she muzzled him.|`|qoL7LTIUaa	ive never heard of a vet doing it i always thought you as the owner made an educated guess using you knowledge of the horse|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	I don't think that is a horse test. To truly know the temperament of a horse, you have to really ride it and get to know it.
eKxPSMolaa	my guinea pig got kidney stones. she lived through it because we got her medicine. sounds similar to what my baby went through. if that is the case, don't worry because she went without treatment for a few days and she lived 2 years after that (till she was 6, which is a very long time in piggy years)! so just relax, and get her to a vet a soon as possible!|`|AA11887983	The best thing to do is make sure that she is not having any difficulty breathing, is eating something that she likes, and that she stays fairly warm.  If she seems to be a lot worse tonight, you might want to find an emergency clinic that is open.  But otherwise, you are doing the right thing getting her in to see the vet.  They can decide if she has anything serious wrong, and then treat her properly.     Good luck with the pig!|`|qaLPcjIzaa	Just make her comfortable, that's all you can do really if you wait. None of those symptoms sound good and if she were mine I'd be on my way to an emergency vet right now.

bb60640c96610ff5b7eb5df5251f191caa	Its a great way to train, although it apears that there is some confusion here about how it really works.     No you don't need the clicker all the time, you don't have to use just treats, and yes some dogs initially afraid of the sound, but there are many ways around that too.     Like Fur and Fiction I to have many clickers. There's one in the car, one in my coat, one in my bait bag, several laying around the house, and 10 on my desk for an upcoming puppy class. And no I don't keep them around like that because my dogs are dependant on them to do anything. They are kept like that because I'm really good at losing things, and when asked its easier for me to demo/explain a clicker if I have one with. Besides that I have an addiction for buying dog related things, especially when there's a sale on something. LOL    Clicker training isn't only effective with dogs either, it also works with cats, fish, rats, chickens etc.     Did you know that they train rats to detect landmines and TB? These rats are trained using clicker training. http://www.herorat.org    Dolphins and whales are trained in a similar manner only a whistle is used instead. With fish people use a flashlight instead of a clicker. http://fr.youtube.com/watch?v=STLgWyXGUM...|`|t78DA6Dpaa	I trained one of my dogs using a clicker. He does very well with it. Gets excited whenever he sees or hears it. He knows when he hears it it's time to work. You just need to be coordinated enough to when the right moment to use it as praise.|`|t8eclWGXaa	i use clicker training whenver i volunteer @ my animal shelter.    it doesnt work all the time because the dog might be scared of the sound.    but i have found it to work.  i used the clicker to play fetch with the dogs. once they dropped the ball, i click, and then give them a treat.    but thats where another problem comes in. i think that the dog would be more focused on the treat than the actual lesson. in other words, i think the dog might stop doing the desired tricks or commands if treats were taken out of the equation.    clicker training only reinforces positive behavior, but sometimes it might be frustrating if the dog you are working on is not responding to your commmands.    but all said and done, clicker training is a wonderful way of training your dog, it just takes time and patience|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	I've used it for my greyhounds and started training my Belgian tervuren with a clicker from the day I got him.  He not only learned everything incredibly quickly, he absolutely loves to learn.  I think the clicker is a great tool if used correctly because dogs have some control over their learning, they realize what they're doing to cause the pay-off they get, so they want to learn more.|`|1399ad3bbdc56a8d68fc6ce5430a21ffaa	I swear by it.  I own (and lose) MANY clickers.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Never used it. I have voice trained. Our dogs know some hand signals.|`|AA10112346	I have never tried it myself.

Wn4tjazIaa	Get a spray bottle and fill it with water. Spray them and say "NO." when you catch them near the fish tank. If they ignore the water/play with the water (I know some cats who actually like it/ignore it) then use white vinegar. They should stop when sprayed with that. Keep the bottle near, but not next to, the fish tank. They should eventually stay away.|`|149431ea2f3b89f5db80c249bc2fc557aa	take the tank/bowl to another room where they can't see it, reach it, also try to get something to cover it, and squirt the cats with some water to teach them a lesson. dont kill them like that one guy said|`|fp6zA1rAaa	kill the cats, throw them in a food processor, and feed them back to the fish|`|IHu3RkM1aa	spritz them with a water bottle whenever they get near the fish tank.  it's harmless, but they hate it and eventually will learn that they are being bad when they go near the tank.  the water spritzing method is harmless, and sends a very clear signal to the cat.  i have used it to train my cats not to scratch my furniture.|`|Vs0IUubzaa	Go to your hardware store and get a piece of plexiglass cut to cover the top of your aquarium so your cat's can't get in it.  If there is a table they jump up on then get some plastic carpet runner, the one with the little plastic spikes on the underside.  It won't hurt them but they won't like it and will stop jumping up there.

G0KKfXMUaa	Well I used to work at a barn (cleaning stalls, water buckets, etc.) if that's what you mean?    That doesn't pay well, and is very time consuming and laborious.    But if you train, the pay gets better. Normally, I charge $30 for a half hour, and $40 for an hour. The price can vary though depending on the skill of the rider, and what the rider wants to practice.    Time for one lesson normally takes about an hour of your time, though it is a fun experience. I normally set up multiple lessons in one afternoon verses spreading them all over the week and days.    Being a groom also didn't pay that well, and it can get kind of dull after a while. But depending on how many horses you groom, it's not as time consuming as training.    I go to school, but I still have time for lessons after school. I only do one to two a day.    Have fun.|`|zvqspfSCaa	I used to work on a ranch as a student. i was learning to train horses and was helping around the ranch but that was to pay for my boarding not my lessons. it was paying for $175 a week for the boarding. i worked about 3 hrs a day there cleaning stalls for my trainer and 2 hrs training horses so it was a total of 5 hrs a day 6 days a week.|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	I worked on a breeding farm.

There was no riding time!|`|SzW9GmRsaa	What?  They PAY working pupils now?    In my day (err, I'm not ancient, I just sound it sometimes) you did all the work for the pleasure of being around top horses and riders.  If you were lucky you'd get a ride or two after you'd been there for a while - like a month, after you'd proven your determination and dedication.    I spent a couple of summers with a top rider in my teens.  I lived in a spidery caravan with two other girls.  We brought our horses with us and spent all day mucking out, if we were lucky we had a horse to bath and plait up but usually the higher girls did that, we were there to clean up.  I think I was there for nearly three weeks before I was on a horse other than my own, and I got to warm him up for half an hour.  Working pupils really have to prove their worth.  You're slave labour, not a hired rider!|`|u1HahCoqaa	The only "Working Students" I know of are people who go to work with professionals- Like I know 3 people who are or were working students with Becky Holder, and atleast one other for someone else I cannot remember.   And what they do is go down there, live at the barn. They do everything from hauling some horses to shows (Sometimes it takes more than one rig) cleaning the barn, cooling out horses, feeding, fixing things on the farm, ect. ect. In return they are given a chance to learn from the person, take lessons either for free or a greatly reduced rate, watch them teach, accomply them to shows. At shows they might be grooms, but not the really big shows- the professional has their own personal established groom for that!   Anyways, it is purely a learning experience. They are usually supplied housing as part of it, although that varies from trainer to trainer. Usually they are not provided food, or any supplies- It is not something you go into to make money!      This is all for big name people though- I mean, all of the people I know who have been working students, who I have gotten this info from, have been working students for big name people. These are people who are doing very well at the biggest shows, have gone to the olympics. So it would prolly be different for lesser-known people, or barns.     Personally, I wouldnt do it. But like I said, I think the type of Working Student is not what you are thinking of. The way I think of it, you only do it if you are very serious about your riding career, and really good.  Its a money drain. It is a learning experience, thats all. I am planning on going into biology- I am not planning on becoming a trainer, that being my career. So I wouldnt do it, but if you want to be a trainer, or professional rider, great.    Hope I helped a bit,|`|e334d47d0cf581231e2545cccfc166e2aa	Usually working students work in exchange for lessons and opportunities with a top trainer.  You can work out your own deals, though.  I was a working student for Sally O'Connor and got a small paycheck, lessons on a schoolmaster every other day, and rode a few other horses unsupervised every day.  She wanted to do a no-pay working student program, but I needed some money as well as wanted the experience, so we compromised with fewer lessons and some pay.    I worked Saturdays and filled in on some other days for a top level dressage trainer.  I got paid and would take some of the horses on trail rides for exercise and variety (they only got 1/2 hour turnout if the weather was perfect).  Her regular working students were provided with an apartment and a small salary.    I worked for several years as a horse trainer at another barn, breaking 2 or 3 year olds, and got paid by the ride.  I usually rode each horse for about 2 months, and had only one or two horses going at once, so it was a part time thing.  I don't remember exactly how much I was paid, but it was about 10 years ago so the numbers would be out of date anyway.    As far as the work and time involved, in most working student cases you'd be working all day, doing all chores plus riding, in a lesson and/or on your own.|`|EghHVkHEaa	I am a working student currently...I LOVE LOVE IT!!

The only reason i started working was to gain a lot of knowledge about not just riding but horses in general. Its a good thing to do before you buy your first horse, and i totally recommend it. Its a lot of fun, and everyone you work with loves horses; what can go wrong? haha.    Might i add its VERY hard work. The first day i started i threw up because i wasn't used to working to hard, especially in the mornings. haha.

But from what I hear most working students have to much stalls, clean water, etc|`|3LXbUg1raa	As a college student my freshman year I worked for the college at the horse barn.  Pay was about $8/hr, shifts were from about 5:30am-8/9am, 12n-1pm, and 4-5/6pm depending.  Duties included:    grain/hay horses  water  turnout/bring in  general care/first aid if needed  catch lesson horses for classes  clean stalls- mornings only if horses were able to go outside, am & pm if horses were in all day due to injury/health or inclement weather    Sophomore year I started working as a groom at the racetrack.  First year of that work started at 5:30am until noon; if I had morning class, I'd work until the class started then go to class...when I was done with class I'd come back to either help finish morning chores, afternoon chores, and/or evening chores depending on the particular day and my class schedule...my boss worked with our school schedules.  It payed about $10/hr.  Duties included:    grooming/bathing  feed/water  cool out horses/ exercise horses on walker  tack horses for riders  leg up riders  lead horses to track if needed  clean stalls- mornings thoroughly, afternoons & evenings pick poop  doctor horses as needed including cold hosing legs  spray stalls w/ fly spray every other day  get horses for pony horses to take out to the track    ~this job was fun but hard; things needed to be done well, but quickly as the track was only open for a short time slot with which you needed to try to get as many horses out as possible for exercise.  You ran your but off and the work was never done...we had about 40 horses to care for.    Over summer vacation, I worked full time at the track from 4:30am-12n then again from 3/4-6/7pm.  On Thurs. & Fri. was night racing, so afternoon breaks were shortened and we came back to the barn by 2pm or sometimes didn't even leave except in shifts for lunch.  Races went until 11pm; time it took to get the horses back and cooled off and settled in it was closer to 12-12:30am...then up again at 4:30am to start the day all over again.  Sat. & Sun. races were run during the daytime so work hours went from 4:30am until anywhere between 7-9pm at night depending on how many horses were entered that day and what races they ran in...supper waited until work was done; for lunch someone would run to a fast food place and get something for everyone and it was eaten in bites between vet visits, bathing, grooming, and whatever else needed to be done.  It paid about $600/week.  Duties were the same as the first track job listed above plus cleaning wash stalls & tack, putting horses in/out of the jogging wheel (also known as an equisizer), swimming horses at the pool, taking the stall sour horses for walks and to let them graze grass, holding horses for farrier, deworm horses, trim bridle paths, rake alleys, and any other odd little chores that needed to be done around the barn...    During the off track season over winter, I'd travel home on the weekends and days off from school to work with the racehorses.  This included all of the above mentioned things (except leading horses to a track, swimming, or going to the jogging wheel) plus included turning out all the horses each night and catching/bringing them all in in the morning, putting horses on treadmills, riding green horses, and doing lots and lots of groundwork/desensitizing on the horses, especially the 2-3 yr olds that hadn't ever been to a racetrack yet.  The barn was not heated, and the temp. would drop below zero easily...sometimes -40 F with the wind chill.  On those days, horses were not worked a lot nor hard and mostly desensitizing exercises and general barn chores were done.  Hours over winter were usually from 6:30/7am-12n, and 1pm-5/6pm.  $10/hr    ~As for actual riding lessons...none, except for the few classes offered by the school.  These classes were a req. for equine studies students and cost was the cost of tuition + $200 lab fee per semester.  Riding class for beginners (no matter your actual riding level everyone had to start at the beginning as a req. for the major) was 2x per week for 2hrs each time.  Intermediate & advanced classes were 1x per week for 2hrs each time.    Work was hard and tiring, but I learned a lot from it.  It was a little hard to juggle with school due to the hours req. at the barn leaving not much time for studying.  Hardest part was staying awake for the really boring business type classes...did alright on the tests though; B average.  It doesn't allow much time for parties or to hang out with friends though; that part didn't bother me, but for some it did.  Well, those were my experiences...
AA11887983	Scheduling an appointment with the vet is a good idea.  Bring a stool sample in for frank, too.  The blood in the stool may be a sign of colitis, if it is red blood.  Ulcers would cause tarry stool.      As for the gums, some cats actually develop a type of reaction to their own tartar, causing severe redness and swelling.  They can also just get gum and mouth infections.  Your vet will give you the best idea of what is going on once they examine him.     Feline immunovirus has been known to cause gingivitis and stomatitis, but it your cat has been tested several times, he's probably in the clear.     Good luck~|`|lavd3UHmaa	I can't answer why there is blood in the stool, but it is good you are going to a vet regarding that.  As for chewing on books, in my experience, that seems to be the norm.  I have had two cats and they both loved chewing anything like paper...cardboard boxes, paper, homework etc..  There is someone else on the internet that had a cat chew paper with gum issues.  I included the link below.  Good luck|`|jvHIqtp2aa	Hopefully its nothing serious, but since your family is taking him to the vet just hang in there and see what the vet says. There are so many things and there is no way to diagnose the problem on Y/A. I hope he feels better soon.|`|0X4UXIBvaa	All i can say is bring him to the vet which you are so your good.|`|1CvrXvjoaa	he has feline gingivitis. my cats have the same thing. as for the blood in the poop it is normal. its usually caused from changes in food. for the gum problem you can get all natural remedies at this web site....http://www.onlynaturalpet.com what i give my cats is Plaque Off. it  is all natural sea weed and it does work. fairly cheap as well.   hope this helps  Good Luck!!!
K4GbcfdYaa	It's ok , when i eat chicken my daughter would give some bits of chicken to my cats . My cat used to eat lizards too . But not anymore|`|S7VekdDuaa	He will be fine don't worry!!!^.^|`|2wzGwV5daa	He should be just fine, might puke it up later, but will be fine.|`|tu9eTMPRaa	He'll be ok. Cat's can eat chicken, in fact its a main ingredient in most cat foods,although you should pay more attention to what your cat is doing! Cats, however, can not have certain kinds of people food. Tomatoes, onions, and root vegetables among others are all very bad for kitties. You should be careful of what your kitty ingests and should NOT give kitty people food, no matter how pleading those little eyes are. Giving them the wrong kinds of food can lead to all sorts of health problems down the road. The correct kinds of cat food can lead to a longer, healthier life for your furry buddy :D Remember, when you buy cat food, check the ingredients list to make sure a meat such as chicken is listed first, not a vegetable (a lot of pet food companies use corn by products to bulk up the food!). It's much better for them!|`|1CvrXvjoaa	yes he will be fine. chicken is very good for cats. no he will not get a tummy ache.   hope this helps|`|KlBn8R5Gaa	there might be a mess to clean up later but i think he'll be fine|`|gOnqdQWWaa	yes he will be fine just dont let him get used to it.|`|MZ8uqhNEaa	Lol! That is adorable! I am only laughing because he will be fine! He chewed it right? I hope! :)    He will be Ok, cats can eat chicken, and 1 inch by 1 inch is Ok. It is a little big, but I don't think it will be a problem. Call your vet and ask him/her. They should be able to tell you.      Hope I helped, and I hope he is Ok! (I think he is.)|`|P9K7AYmWaa	chicken?! OMG HES GOING TO DIE. no hun its ok they can eat chicken|`|S3eJJu7haa	Yes he will jut say no to him and put him down hes gonna be fine but no more! =DD|`|SYrJiDKwaa	Should be okay, as long as he's still breathing then there wasn't an ubstruction.|`|87Zhgwmcaa	He will be ok unless the chicken was poisoned, which it wasn't. Trust me, cats naturally eat other animals.
pDPSaL37aa	I've had many different species of finches over the years. I wouldn't say it's mandatory for you to get two of the same species, but of course they would like it that way, so that they will be able to communicate with each other. Sometimes males can be very territorial, but it all depends on their personality (and sometimes their species). If you go to the pet store and look for two males that have already been kept together in the cage, I don't think you would have a problem. They pretty much already know each other. In most bird species, the males are the brighter more colorful ones. Some species of finch, like the Society for example, are all the same (shades of brown and white). You can't tell the difference of a male and female in this species until you notice the males singing or breeding with the females.|`|K0H7bAR8aa	I dont know if they have to be the same species but i have heard that about two boy birds :(|`|fWf3A3Ioaa	Some species can be aggressive when sexually active or breeding - but I'm sure you won't be looking at species of this sort.    You should definitely get more than 1 because they are flock birds and will not do well if alone.    Societies, spice finches, most other mannikins and nuns will all be really docile and not aggressive (for the most part) toward one another.  Zebras can sometimes be testy and pick at others.  Gouldians are fine as long as you are not trying to breed them (males can be aggressive towards other males if bonded with a hen).|`|28WJwHf4aa	You should buy them in pairs. Two makes shouldn't fight, unless you have 2 males and 1 female. Some females are identical to the males, but most are not as colorful. This is for survival reasons as they need to blend in with the nest, making them less likely to be seen by a predator.    Make sure you get a cage that is more long/wide than tall as finches are flight birds. They are happier with being able to fly as opposed to hop and sit on perches.
Mg8zk1n7aa	Here's the thing with housing birds of a different species together...some people will say "It's totally fine, I do it with mine and have never had a problem." The thing is, they are just lucky! And do you really want to risk your bird over something like this? Sometimes even birds of the ~same~ species don't get along.     So, my advice would be -- no, don't. Some people are going to tell you differently, but if you ask the experts I'm sure they would agree with me. It is unsafe.    Hope this helped.|`|6xf1GfbUaa	I totally agree with KitoGirl. When I was doing research about birds, I fell in love with the Indian Ringneck and the Cockatiel and wanted to get both and keep them in the same cage. I received many opinions and most were that it's best to keep them in separate cages, and when you take them out to play, see if they get along. But even if they get along, it's best to keep them in separate cages and just have them interact when they are out of the cages AND if they totally get along well. At the end, I made up my mind and just decided on getting a Blue Indian Ringneck. He's adorable!!!!|`|ZAljSeERaa	if you have the birds caged in 2 different cages and set the cages together and put a perch in each cafe where they can sleep next to each other then put a peach on the other side of the cages if the birds are sleeping on the perches closest to each other then they will be fine! i have seen many aviaries that have finches ringnecks macaws cockatoos ect housed in the same place so yes it can be don you just have to take the time to let them get use to each other and make sure they like each other! also make sure both are healthy so that one will not get the other sick hope this helps|`|WWnkeaIAaa	not really|`|28WJwHf4aa	No, it is not recommended. In the wild, these birds would not naturally flock together. Some may be able to pull it off, but again, it's not the norm.    You would be better off caging them separately and just spending a good amount of time with each every day.
28WJwHf4aa	No, it shouldn't be too strong. I had a filter meant for a 90 gallon tank on my 29 gallon. It did suck up a few African dwarf frogs, but I solved that by placing a netting around the intake tube.|`|5knGTf5paa	some fish like strong currents so i depends on the fish
0f3fde633bd5c269a5dc7fc600702cccaa	If sleeping all day is not her normal behavior then she may very well be sick and you just don't know it.  If everything else is normal and she is eating and drinking as usual has no vomiting or diarrhea, is not coughing or sneezing and has no nasal or eye discharge she may be fine.  Its worth a trip to the vet to make sure.  They may be able to get the jump on things if she is coming down with an illness and get her treated before she gets really sick.  Its always better to be safe than sorry and since she can't say "I just don't feel well today" you should take her to someone who can find that out for you.|`|XgqwQ7szaa	it's probably just the weather my dog lays around all day during snowy or rainy days.|`|ydshiNrKaa	If she is sleeping all the time, there is something wrong and this is not normal behavior.  Take her to the vet and have her checked.
AA11887983	While I don't think it would hurt her, I am not sure that it will help.  It isn't toxic that I am aware of.  But even just encouraging water drinking to dilute her urine is going to make her feel better.  Before you go into the vet tomorrow, try not to allow her to urinate.  If she is one that goes the minute she is on the leash, if you can carry her in, or leave her in the car before her visit that would be better.  That way, your vet has a better chance at getting a sample that can be analyzed.     Good luck!|`|f3f09dd5dab69f7e644b37c4cf98a3abaa	my parents ALWAYS added a little cranberry juice to the dog and cat food and their animals lived very long lives - of course this was more preventative than fix a significant issue - but it' certainly couldn't hurt in this particular case.|`|0f3fde633bd5c269a5dc7fc600702cccaa	You probably shouldn't give her anything until she sees the vet tomorrow.  They will want to do a urinalysis and you don't want to give her anything that might mask something on the test.  Like changing the PH until the vet can assess the tests and determine what exactly is causing the infection, bacteria, crystals.|`|672a1d6963ce82f0b4946e0e58bceb5faa	you can... cranberry juice has been known to help... but... Always check with your veterinarian before adding supplements, even those that seem as safe as cranberry juice. Prolonged overacidification of the urine could lead to some types of bladder stones, such as calcium oxalates.     Prolonged infections often have underlying causes that may not be treatable with at home remedies. So keep your vet in the know.|`|Os6VjLH0aa	Cranberry will help keep the urinary tract healthy, I give one I have that tends to get UTIs cranberry powder to keep her UT clear. I don't think it will help tonight, but, it can't hurt. I wouldn't give her a whole one, try cutting it in two. The juice would also work, if you can get her to drink it.|`|gwUMipsUaa	I would not give her anything without the vet's approval.|`|VBMOuIuxaa	sure can!! to both. just make sure the juice is unsweetened (which as you already stated is not)|`|1e6e1a106474f7febf542c71a7f47818aa	Not sure, maybe dilute it first, could be too acidly.
672a1d6963ce82f0b4946e0e58bceb5faa	wow... that's bad.    6 goldfish should not be in a 10 gallon tank. ONE goldfish shouldn't be in a 10 gallon tank.    goldfish can grow to be 12" or more long... some grow 6" long and wide.     10 gallons is not nearly enough for a full grown ONE goldfish let alone 6. You're goldfish will die young before they have a chance to grow to full size.    and no. Tetras are tropical fish. they need a certain tempurature that is too warm for goldfish.     **    For neons... temp should be 68-74 F, pH should be 5.0-7.0, KH 4-8     you should provide enough real or silk plants (never plastic) so in case they breed and make babies... they have a place to hide to avoid being eaten.    If you remove the goldfish, please make sure you put them in a larger tank... or see if there is an aquatics store or enthusiast who will take them on.
l42UDjFGaa	I'm truly sorry to hear this is happening! It's obvious you're doing everything you can for him. I'm praying for you both.    One possibility here is botulism...ataxia (the staggering and falling), collapsing suddenly, muscle fasiculations/writhing, teeth clicking, spasms, the coughing like behavior...did your vet investigate this possibility? Botulism needs to be treated immediately, according to strain/type, and aggressively. I believe, though I'm not sure, that antibiotics are at least part of the treatment, which may explain why he was doing better the next day. However, if it is botulism, the treatment needs to continue and be very specific to the toxin or he will relapse...    I pray this isn't the case.     Here's some additional information for you to review, just in case.    http://www.equiworld.net/uk/horsecare/ve...  http://www.vetmed.ufl.edu/extension/equi...  http://animalscience.ag.utk.edu/horses/p...    Excerpt from the last link..."Unfortunately, several other equine diseases produce similar clinical signs: equine herpesvirus 1 (EHV1) myeloencephalitis, equine motor neuron disease, equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM), eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE), western equine encephalomyelitis (WEE), and plant toxicity."|`|B6zl0AJDaa	Have the vet do a blood work.  Do you have any oak trees on your property?  Toxins from oak leaves/acorn can cause all of the symptoms to a sudden show up and the horse goes into seizures.  The toxins attack the liver and kidneys.  I lost 2 horses to oak leaves/acorns within the past decade.|`|AA12048299	Is your horse a QH? Is he a relative of Impressive? If so, is he HYPPNN?? Ask your vet if he's checked for muscle enzymes, and go from there...     Has your vet had any experience with EPM? Sounds like it possibly could be that, but the symptoms came on awfully severely, awfully suddenly.. as you sure you hadn't noticed any symptoms previous indicative of a neurological disease? ie: circling only in one direction when in stall, routinely dragging one foot, stumbling, inability to transition into/ hold canter?    It does sound like a severe case of tying up... what color is his urine?    I find it odd that your vet prescribed penicillin for something he's calling a virus. I  believe, pennicillin is used against bacterial infections, not viral. It could be the vet is throwing everything he's got at your horse in the hopes that something works. Is there any way you can bring the horse to a local teaching veterinary university?    Until your horse is stable, I'd keep him in his deeply bedded stall, limit exercise to handwalks only, and feed him some small mashes. Also, give his regular feed quantity per day, just broken up into smaller servings several times throughout the day.  .................  ETA: just read your update. Since he's a draft cross, it could be EPSM. Check out this website for an in-depth description of symptoms, causes, and how to help the horse get past it:  http://www.ruralheritage.com/vet_clinic/...  .................  4rd Edit: Neurological diseases can be determined through a vet's analysis & possibly a spinal tap, sending the spinal fluid to the lab for evaluation. EPSM is tested by taking a muscle biopsy.. pretty uninvasive and quick procedure.   ...............  Yes, EPM is equine protozoal myeloencephalitis. How is your horse today? Does the dr have him on DMSO?|`|XJ9oSR2daa	First I want to tell u how sorry I am ur going thru this.     Second. Did they do a spinal tap?  They need to check the csf.  The only resemblence that I personally have was a friends mule that contracted herpes.  But without the csf results its hard to say.     I wish u the best and ur horse also
vbEkYH2haa	I wouldn't use one personally.  Budgie poop isnt that bad and most birds i have known to have them have FREAKED out. Most of the time the only birds that are happy with the flight suit are the ones that have been trained from a VERY young age.|`|PBE5a4vDaa	why not just let your budgie fly in a safe room?  Mine does and he loves it  Just make sure you close all doors, windows etc so there is no chance of escape. also make sure there isn't anything dangerous laying around eg: electrical cords  as far as harnesses or flight suits ,i've only ever seen them for larger birds like cockatoos

One day, it will be very comfortble inside the house.|`|0accd20a753414614a02981356511fc6aa	He is very scared, bright light, different sounds( are scary). Try tuna fish made in oil ,,cats love fish oil. You will more than likely have to drop a blanket over him, to bring him back in the house, living in the house is where he is use to being.

You say "my ""indoor cat"" that LOVES [being] outside...    If your cat loves being outside, it's not an indoor cat. Let the cat out on a regular basis, and it might find its way back to you. The cat is likely quite capable of surviving on its own out of doors.    As of now, I won't help you to drag an out-doors loving cat back in.     Animals are quite capable of choosing where they want to live.    Sounds like the cat has made the choice to not live with you anymore.|`|1Ud4bLeFaa	Give him tuna fish. It works for me, so it would work for a cat. (really, that is the only way to get me to obey
TkJn9gO0aa	Johnny is absolutely correct. Most of the phenotypes prior to the change are going to depend on the dam's and sire's phenotypes and genotypes. There are different line-bred and "morphs" of chondros available and any mixture of the two is most likely going to produce proportions of offspring varying from parents to parents.     Yes, some of the babies might be "special" and possess different colors than the rest.....again, this largely depends on the parents.     It's really difficult to give estimates when there is no lineage or even possible lineages to work with. Otherwise, we'd literally just be guessing.|`|AA10049109	It depends.  If both parents were red neonates, most of the babies tend to be red.  In Arus, all babies are yellow...all the time. Same with canaries. I have heard of rare instances of red neonates in those clutches, but you can almost always count on yellow.  If one parent was yellow and the other a red neonate, it will be a mix.  There's no telling how many.  Some of it depends upon how many survive to hatch.  There's a good chance that uless the animals were very inbred as they are in the high yellow and high blue lines, that the babies won't be like the parents.  One of the nice things about chondros is the lack of knowing what you'll get!  It's always a surprise.  That said, it can be dissapointing if you just paid $5000 for a high blue animal and it ends up looking like your average chondro.|`|6j9EZXGWaa	In a regular clutch of chondro hatchlings, I have seen that yellow is more consistent at birth. If one or, both parents are color morphs, hatchlings will carry genetics for producing color mutations. Without any type of prior genetic information on the parenting snakes ( F1, het. and so on) , it can be difficult to predict morphism turn out acurately and in what generation of offspring the mutation will begin to express itself. Having an established breeding colony that is backed with genetic records of individual snakes which is focused on targeting a specific mutation can help predict what baby snakes may look like when they hit the ground.
bI7wMCJXaa	If you're only going to ride your own horse once a month his/her conditioning won't be good enough to do jumping or other strenuous physical activity. My suggestion would be to take one lesson a week and then ride your horse all the other days with maybe one additional day off.    You are probably going to have a lot of bad habits to undo. Bareback riders tend to scrunch their legs and tilt forward to maintain their balance with no saddle. Whatever discipline you go into you should be starting at the very beginning to learn proper seat and hands. Once you know how to walk-trot-canter without stirrups then you can specialize into whatever discipline you want.|`|FcR8G8hPaa	It will be difficult for you to become expert at a complex discipline if this is the time you have. Reining, dressage, trail classes, etc are probably out of reach or will take you many many years at that rate.    I'd suggest starting with equitation. You can compete in this and can also build on it if your interest lasts and you are able to ride more.There are English and Western varieties. You can then go from there to Western Pleasure or English Pleasure, or other, more complex disciplines.    Here's a video:    http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseac...    Here's some material:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equitation    I hope this helps!|`|BIR9olyxaa	Probably western, since it's more fun and laid-back.|`|G0KKfXMUaa	Well, set aside the jumping, I think you would enjoy western more.    I myself do english, and I jump. But if you don't think you'd like to jump much, I would just stick to western.    You seem like you'd rather ride for fun. And in my opinion, I think western is more laid back, easy, and fun, especially for trail riding. And many western-trained horses are calm, comfortable, and easy-going.     You could always start out western, and if you like it, great. If not, just switch to english. Though, if you're getting a new saddle, make sure you're going to stick to that type of riding, because they're expensive and sometimes hard to sell now a days.    Oh, and if you own the horse, I would ride him more than once a month. If not ridden often, certain horses can begin to act up... or even have medical problems (lack of exercise). If you just can't ride that often, then at least try to have him ridden by a friend, or even lunge him. And make sure he gets turned out often.|`|u1HahCoqaa	Well, what are you interested in? If you like the western thing, do western. If you want to jump, do English.   You can specialize from there- barrels, dressage, Hunter/jumper, whatever. But decide and get a saddle to fit- You cannot take lessons in a bareback pad.    Although if you want to progress, truely, you have to ride more than once a week, plus once a month! Horseback riding is a sport- if you want to get anywhere, you must treat it as such. You cannot go on the basketball team, go to practice once or twice in the season, and expect to play well. Also, you would just be wasting your lesson money. You would progress very slowly, and you would be further slowed because your horse wouldnt be in shape, because he is only ridden once or twice a week.     And by taking lessons, you must be interested in actually getting somewhere, accomplishing something. You must take it seriously, to some extent.       You have to put in the time to get the results.  -----------------  So, your choice on what to do. Do what you want- I am all for English, personally.  Any discipline of it.   But whatever you do, I suggest you make an effort to ride more than 5 times a month, tops!|`|5TCewPYRaa	If you have your own horse, why not get an instructor to come to you so you can learn WITH your horse and learn how to ask for stuff on her as opposed to a lesson horse and then getting fustrated when the cues for certain things are different on your horse??    You need to pick what you are interested in... if you are only taking lessons in the summer--thats only about 8 lessons...it will take that long for you to learn how to properly jump or basically learn how to properly do any one or two thing (s).....pick something you are certain you cannot learn by yourself...or something you won't get bored with---also something that you will be able to do at home--no point in wasting 8 weeks of lessons on something you dont have the equipment or horse for at home!    If you want to jump, I'm sure the riding school has english saddles that will fit you--if you find out you like it--you can sell your western saddle and get an english one!      You will not want to learn to jump in a bareback pad--trust me.  You need something with structure---also if you arent in the proper postion--you will hurt the horse or cause it to be unbalanced and who knows what will happen then...!     Whatever you choose--good luck! I suggest researching some of your interests and seeing what you can do with what you have at home and stuff...good luck! And you really need to ride your own horse more than once a month dear! How hard is it to hop on once a week for a ride?? Really.|`|b8vjXmnfaa	I would ride more than that.    But I would take lessons western. You can use the saddle you have, unless you are planning on showing. I see people in saddles way to big all the time. If you are planning on jumping once or twice you need to jump something smaller then a barrel, like a log on a trail or some like 1 ft.
0f3fde633bd5c269a5dc7fc600702cccaa	Put an E collar on him until you can get him to the vet so they can look at the bumps and tell you what they are and what the appropriate treatment is. It could be anything from a bug bite to an abscess.  Best bet is to have the vet look at it.|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	First you take him to the vet to find out why he's chewing himself so hard. could be Fleas, Mites, Allergies, or you dont know.

So we need to know when we should get them to the vet for some professional cat care.     Diarrhea means that your cat is passing loose, watery farces.     This means that it is loosing fluids, and along with that fluid, they are also loosing vital nutrients such as salts and sugars called 'electrolytes'.     i would say it has ruptured something and all the fluid has come out
28WJwHf4aa	Hamsters are solitaire animals. She is getting used to not only a new surrounding, but now a weird larger-than-her object (you) that keeps talking and poking around her home. She'll get used to you in time. Just give her, her space for now. Keep trying the treats from your hand as this will help her to learn to trust you.     Hamsters are also nocturnal. She will be more active at night than during the day.|`|672a1d6963ce82f0b4946e0e58bceb5faa	sweetie... she's brand new... you've uprooted her from the only place she's known, and brought her to a brand new place. She doesn't know you from beans. It will take several days for her to recognize you, and several more to trust you.    also, hamsters are nocturnal so they will be more active at night.    Keep the hamster away from direct sunlight and drafts, keep her away from high trafficed areas to lower the stress...    talk to her every single time you walk by her cage... even when she is sleeping, so she gets use to your voice.    place your hand in and let HER approach you. Don't even bother petting her, just let her explore your hand to realize you're not a threat. Offer treats...     yes she will run the treat into her little house. They're pack animals. they will stuff food in their cheeks and bury it away. that's why you need to clean the cage of fruits daily. If they don't eat them that night, remove them before they rot.     once you've shown you're not a threat, a few days later, start petting her. Eventually that will lead to picking her up, holding her close to your chest, sitting on the floor... this will make her feel safe and secure.    eventually she'll feel at home, and calm down.    make sure she has fresh food and fresh water daily... plenty of chew treats for her teeth, and hamster blocks accessable at all times.|`|UEMKteMnaa	i had a hamster... when it was new it always used to sleep and sneak out for some food... and its probably a little shaky cause its scared. It might not be used to you yet. Hamsters are not that exiting when they are tired. It will sleep all the time and go on the wheel every while, but not stay on it for a while. A thing that hamsters love are finished rolls of toilet paper, the center cardboard. My hamster used to always have fun going through it and chewing on it. It turned out mine was a girl, she had 6 kids! You shouldn't get another hamster and put it in with this one because hamsters don't get along well. the siblings always used to fight :-)|`|ak9DrBSwaa	Here's a site to help you learn more about your pet.    http://www.hamsterific.com/hamsters.cfm      Your hamster sounds pretty normal. Syrians are nocturnal and will sleep most of the day and be more lively in the evening and night.    Freezing when you approach - hamsters are food to pretty much anything bigger than they are - it freezes to keep you from seeing it and eating it! Ok, we all know you wouldn't eat your pet, but your hamster doesn't see all that well. You can help get her used to you walking in by announcing your coming, call her name as you come into the room and talk to her.|`|NnYB9eXiaa	Hi :)    First off, when you bring a new hamster home, you should give it a full week to adjust without touching or petting it.  I know this sounds difficult, it's new and cute and you really want to love her - but if you stress her out she could get wet tail which is really really bad.      [Edit: Do NOT give her any of the wet tail "preventative" or "dri tail" drops in her water - she's healthy now and they're a broad spectrum antibiotic that kill ALL the bacteria in a hamster's body, not just the bad stuff.  If your hamster ever does get wet tail, take her to a vet, do NOT use the pet store products to try and cure her!]    She's acting like EVERY hamster does in a new home - she's perfectly fine and healthy!.  Hamsters aren't actually nocturnal, they're crepuscular. Crepuscular is a term used to describe animals that are primarily active during twilight, that is at dawn and at dusk.    She's surrounded by new smells and sounds, new cage, new toys, new everything - she's going to be hyper, curious and also cautious for a little while when she's awake checking these things out - but yes, she will sleep a lot.  You're also about 300 times bigger than she is - she's going to have to get used to you being around :) Here are some tips on handling her after your week is up:    Remember to never wake your hamster up to play! They'll be calmer if they've been running in their wheel for a while as well, and lastly, just like a human -- they may not be in the mood to play some days!    1. Wash your hands carefully with a non-fruity or heavily scented soap - this will keep them from wanting to taste, and possibly bite your hand.  Others may advise you to wear gloves - this prevents the hamster from learning your scent, and you want them to know YOU when you're handling them, not the smells on a glove.    2. NEVER reach into the hamster cage and try to *grab* your hamster. Hamsters are quite protective of their homes and will try to defend them (aka bite you or flip over and scream -- which is a defense mechanism). Females tend to be more "cage aggressive" than males, although with time and patience, this will diminish with either one.    3. Hold a small cup or bowl in front of the cage door with a yummy treat in it - the hamster will crawl in almost every time.    4. Slide the lil guy out of the cup/bowl into your hand - and voila! You're holding your hamster and haven't been bitten!    Be careful as they will be a bit skittish. Of course you'll want to be sure to be extra gentle as they are still animals and can bite when they get scared!  They may also lick/nibble your fingers, don't mistake this for biting, it just means they're curious.  Nibbling tickles - biting hurts ;)    Once your hamster gets more accustomed to you and how you smell, you'll be able to skip step 3 and they'll crawl right into your hand.    Best of luck - and have patience!|`|Jguzosm2aa	One thing you need to know is that hamsters are nocturnal. They sleep most of the day and are relatively inactive when they're not. You shouldn't expect to see too much of her activity, unless you're normally up quite early/late.    She's going to be nervous of you for awhile yet. At a pet store, us giant two legged creatures just bring food, water and clean. It's going to take time for her to adjust to socializing with you. She's also still adjusting to her new environment which has some funny new things but not a single warm fuzzy body to curl up with/on - quite the opposite of the only world she's ever known.    You're on the right track. Just keep doing what you're doing and she'll come around. Don't give up, and don't back off just because she doesn't come around right away. Keep talking to her, offering treats from your hand, and just watching and/or petting her.|`|oNxq0oCYaa	Nothing is wrong with her it's just that hampsters sleep during the day and like to play at night.|`|I6KKFwxXaa	give her a few more days it usually takes at least a week for them to get used to being in a new habitat and all the new noises of you house. Don't try to hold her right away and just keep an eye out for wet tail sometimes pets can get stressed out from going from one place to another. i used to work in a pet store and we recommended the use of wet tail in water for the first week in smaller amounts than the normal dose.|`|XrMMH5tZaa	watch her at night theyre nocturnal  she might be more active and happy then|`|nmzpdvkqaa	i think she needs to meet my python reggie

If you have a book on hermit crabs i recommend looking for more information on the internet and talking to professionals can help out too. Good luck with your Hermit Crab. Also another suggestion is that your hermit crab is lonely. Hermit means to live alone but Hermit crabs have to have at least 1 other crab with it. Try getting another crab and see if this improves the crabs' health|`|S4j2zex8aa	You will need to take all the sand out and put more water and food in the tank. The sand could injury her/him.
j2Fkp5X2aa	A therapy dog is usually considered a dog which visits hospitals, nursing homes and the like to cheer people up, while what you would be referring to is an emotional support animal, which are pets for people with mental health conditions, and which have a right to live in no pets housing.    What you want is a very calm and easy going dog which is not startled easily and will reamin calm when all around them is falling apart. You do not want a dog which is going to react to percieved danger, as this is only going to make your daughters situation worse. You do not need a dog to bark and lunge everytime your daughter sees someone who reminds them of the attacker. What she does need is a dog who will remain calm no matter what is going on around her, to allow your daughter to realise that not all people are dangerous. Any mentally healthy dog will bark and proctect if the need arises, but you do not want a dog who does so eveytime your daugher stresses out as this is playing into her fears, and is going to make her condition worse and not better.    I stronlgy suggest you read this article:   http://www.iaadp.org/ptsd.html    Getting a puppy can be difficult as the puppy will be looking to your daugher for support in growing up and can learn to be fearful being aorund such people. Stable dogs can be difficult to find in shelters. It may be a long slow road to trying to find a suitable dog.     One option would be to apply for a failed guide dog, from a guide dog program. These are dogs have been carefully bred and raised, socialised extensively and also have basic obedience. They would be aged between 1-2 years of age and would have been withdrawn from the formal training for any number of reasons. They are usually great with people with anxiety and depression. Often the waiting lists can be long, but it can be well worth the wait, for the right dog. Some programs may gvie you priority because of your daughters condition. To find such a program look at the International Guide Dog Federation website to find programs near you, and then contact them directly.    http://www.ifgdsb.org.uk/worldmap.asp    Reserch the breeds on offer from such programs and decide if there is a specific breed that you would like.|`|W0buucLsaa	I'm sorry for your daughter - I hope she gets better!

The dog must enjoy the company of strangers and being petted, a lot! The dog must be happy going to new places where there are lots of people.

They are natural family guardians, excellent judges of character and I know several who are certified therapy and service dogs. As puppies, they're quite rambunctious and goofy. Once they mellow out, they are the biggest lapdogs out there. They're extremely family-oriented, many of them are flat-out velcro dogs. (These are dogs that always want to be with you.) They're generally very good with other pets, dogs and friendly strangers, and they're excellent with children. A well-bred Mastiff who has been properly socialized has a very even temperament and is very well-mannered with strangers.. that is, unless you do not accept the stranger. They will indeed pick up on apprehension. I cannot tell you how many people I know who were amazed at how well their usually docile, people-loving dog handled the situation when dangerous stranger approached. (I'm a member of a Mastiff forum.) The sheer size of this dog alone is enough to deter someone, I know I wouldn't want to go up against 200 pounds of muscle, and their bark is like thunder.     This site has a good amount of very interesting Mastiffs. I randomly clicked on one, and that very first one was about a Mastiff (Dozer, I believe) who was adopted because the family's son had PTSD.  http://sneakpeeks.typepad.com/mastiffs/     She might be put off by their big, slobbery jowls at first. I was fourteen when my dad decided we should get a Mastiff, and let me tell you, I'm now sixteen and wouldn't want any other dog.    Also, whatever breed, I recommend a male. They're typically more chilled out and goofy than females. No mood swings!|`|n4pNNcGfaa	You mean emotional support dog, not therapy dog.  A therapy dog goes visiting with his owner to cheer up others.    Remember that there is a difference between an emotional support dog and a protection dog.  Emotional support is what she needs now, not an attack dog.    Please read this important article:  "Disaster Is Not What a Trauma Victim Needs"  http://www.iaadp.org/ptsd.html    Getting a reactive or overtly protective dog would dangerous.  Avoid breeds known for protectiveness.  Choose instead a dog who has a rock solid calm temperament and an absolute level head.  Such a dog will remain calm and reassuring during panic attacks, instead of fueling the fire by lunging and growling at every one in sight because he's mis-read your daughter's symptom as a real threat.    A mentally sound dog will indeed protect her if she is ever really threatened.  You needn't worry about that.  But a calm, well socialized, well grounded dog won't be going off protecting her when it isn't needed and getting you into lawsuits.      Your best bet for a bomb proof dog is to find a retired show dog.  I know that sounds odd, but you'd be getting a young adult who is very well socialized, housebroken and experienced in seeing the world.    I'd suggest you look for something like a lab or lab mix.  It's pretty hard to set a mentally sound lab off accidentally.    When you get the dog, enroll them both in dog obedience classes.  You tend to meet a nice class of person in dog classes.  They're animal lovers.  Another neat thing about obedience classes is that everyone is focused on the dogs, usually their own.  Social situations are easier because it is never inappropriate to talk about your dog if you don't know what to say.  It isn't considered strange if you don't make eye contact with others because most people will be watching their dogs.  Obedience classes are usually safe social situations for people with anxiety disorders to practice in.    Good luck.  I wish you and your daughter the best.|`|77b1dc8e9ba4f99da65a538c28e739c3aa	How old is your daughter and how much are willing to spend?

A dog is a whole lot more than just cuddles and feeding it. Dogs usually live for 10-15 years, which is a huge commitment.    They need exercise, discipline and affection IN THAT ORDER.     I would suggest doing HEAPS of research before making the descison to bring home a dog/puppy.     Here's some good websites to start with:  http://www.doginfomat.com/b4ugetadog.htm  http://www.cesarmillaninc.com/tips/addit...  http://www.akc.org/future_dog_owner/read...  http://www.pets.ca/articles/article_gett...

Grooming Needs> This breed needs a good deal of grooming. Twice a week is the minimum it should be brushed. Daily is better.    Health Screening> You need to look for a breeder who carefully screens for hip dysplasia.    Cost> These dogs grow fast as puppies and while they are growing they eat A LOT!

Do you want a big dog to make you feel safe, or do you want a small dog that you can cuddle with?  If you want a big security dog that's good with kids (and I might be biased here) I'd say go with a Rottweiler. They look scary, but they will protect you, your child, and they are very patient, loving dogs. You have to train them properly, as with all dogs, so if you're not willing to put in the work, don't get a dog at all.  If you prefer a smaller lap dog, consider a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel. They're not tiny yippy monsters, they're on the bigger end of the toy breeds, but they are loyal, sweet, and very affectionate. They're the kind of dog that will snuggle with you all night. For a child with post traumatic stress disorder, this could be just what she needs. They're also relatively easier to train than some other dogs since they're not terribly dominant in nature.   Keep in mind too there are thousands of wonderful loving dogs as close as your nearest shelter who need homes. The good thing about shelter dogs is you can try them out before you buy them and find the perfect fit for your daughter. They're also substantially less expensive than a purebred dog will be.   Whatever you choice, I wish you the best of luck with your daughter. My spouse has PTSD, and its a terrible terrible thing for someone to have. Luckily for your daughter, it only happened once and she obviously has a mother who loves her and is taking appropriate measures to help her. Some people never recover sadly, but I think your girl will be o.k. as long as you both work very hard together and you continue to support her.
AA11887983	I'm not sure that anyone should eat them regularly!  Yuck!!!  But seriously,  do not feed them to your dog.  They have a large amount of fat and are greasy.  That is a prime recipe for pancreatitis or gastroenteritis.  At the very least, they will make your dog fat.  None of these things is very good for the dog.  So stick to good quality dog treats and dog food, and keep your dog healthy!|`|mIlWfcOVaa	No      Bones from fish, poultry, or other meat sources:  Can cause obstruction or laceration of the digestive system.

OAzJPUkHaa	Let me address a few issues I have before answering the question.  Do you have a hygrometer to be 100% sure that your humidity isn't good?  Having one is the only real way to tell, mist on the glass can mean your humidity is too high(I have heard people that's a good way to tell your tank is humid, trust me it's not).    If you want to see how many gallons your tank is use this.  Just get the measurements of your tank, and find the volume.   http://www.metric-conversions.org/volume...  Your tank might be overstocked, depending on how large your crabs are.  You can look at this link and learn how to properly size your  crabs(it's a pretty good website if you want to look over it).  7 micros or tinys(1inch under) should be OK in a 10 gallon tank, 7 small crabs (1.5) should be good in a 20 gallon.  Overstocking can lead to aggression.  http://www.crabbytalk.com/05192005/how-b...    Any who, to answer your question The tank should be in the good 75-80% range. You can spray the tank, but that can get pretty annoying as you'll need to spray often. Moist substrate, moss pits, and home made humidifiers will do the job of keeping a nice humid tank.  Poke a little hole in a corner of substrate and gently pour water into it when ever the substrate starts drying. Properly prepare moss by letting it moisten in salt water and sticking it in the microwave for a few seconds. You can stick it in a second level or a corner in your tank. This is a pretty good humidifier you can make.  http://www.instructables.com/id/The-10-H...  This is has pretty good info on moss. http://naturallycrabby.com/home/blog1.ph...  Hiawatha moss is a pretty safe to use.  You can try using sponges, but they don't increase humidity as well as moss will.  If you do get sponges, they don't need to be kept in any of you water bowls.  They'll probably just take up precious water space.  Sticking them in a clam shell on their own would be fine.  Have at least two(preferably more) sponges to alternate between them.  Sterilize the sponge used in the tank daily, as they're perfect for breeding harmful bacteria(I think they're a waste of money).|`|Ru4IEZ36aa	maybe you can put a light over the tank?|`|C3DSUacAaa	Do you already have a moist sponge sitting in their tank?

ydshiNrKaa	The fovea, also known as the fovea centralis, is a part of the eye, located in the center of the macula region of the retina.  The fovea is responsible for sharp central vision (also called foveal vision), which is necessary in humans for reading, watching television or movies, driving, and any activity where visual detail is of primary importance. The fovea is surrounded by the parafovea belt, and the perifovea outer region: the parafovea is the intermediate belt where the ganglion cell layer is composed of more than five rows of cells; as well as the highest density of rods; the perifovea is the outermost region where the ganglion cell layer contains two to four rows of cells, and is where visual acuity is below the optimum. The perifovea contains an even more diminished density of cones, having 12 per 100 microns versus 50 per 100 microns in the most central fovea. This, in turn, is surrounded by a larger peripheral area that delivers highly compressed information of low resolution. The optic nerve carries approximately 50% of nerve fibers for transmitting information from the fovea, while the other 50% carry information from the rest of the retina. The parafovea extends to a distance of 1? mm from the central fovea, and the perifovea is found 2? mm away from the fovea centralis.
wSaLPAlKaa	hi i work at a vet office and i can tell u the first thing is make sure the puppy is WARM. Most puppy's die of hypothermia. All puppies huddle together to stay warm. Next they sell puppy milk in the stores and baby bottles of puppy and kittens. put a couple of oz. in the bottle and warm it under running hot water if u put it in microwave it get to hot. place puppy in a warm Towel belly side down and feed it with baby bottle. the reason u feed baby animals belly down is becuz when there with their mom shes on here side and the babies are on their belly's so they can nurse off of her. Make sure he/she eats every 2 to 3 hrs and at least 1 to 2 oz. till about 6 to 8 weeks then u can introduce puppy food. hope this helps and good luck!!|`|f3f09dd5dab69f7e644b37c4cf98a3abaa	Sometimes if the mom is trying to kill the puppy at this age - it may be cause of survival of the fittest and there is something wrong with the puppy.

Do not give any cow's milk, as this can cause stomach upset.  Most grocery stores that have a pet department have some variety of milk replacer.  Or you can call an emergency vet clinic and see if they have any.      The pup needs to eat every 4hours, at that age.  You also have to be very careful that it does not get exposed to other dogs, as the chance for illness is very high in a pup this young.  And you are absolutely right to get it to a vet tomorrow.  They can give the best advice on feeding and care once it has been examined.     good luck!|`|XgqwQ7szaa	get ready for a long night  keep it warm with plenty of blankets and maybe a clock to sound like the pup's moms heartbeat. feed him through a baby bottle and try to find something other than regular milk. blend some dry food and water and give him that. get to the vet right away tomorrow and good luck!
fv0U7ft1aa	nooo not at all!! it's your dog and you can name her whatever you'd like to! Sonny sounds like a name that could go either way, but is usually paired with males...either way you're naming a dog so people get creative anyway! i say go for it! :)|`|kn5H2gsGaa	Well, I guess you just have to think about it. I think it would be a good name though.|`|77b1dc8e9ba4f99da65a538c28e739c3aa	My daughters name is Kevin!|`|gwUMipsUaa	Name it what you want.  Most people will think it's spelled Sunny.|`|AlZPIAtmaa	Only if you spell it with a U.  Sunny.|`|AQoby9NZaa	Yes|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	If you literally meant it as "sonny," as in your son, yes, it would be inappropriate and inaccurate. But as a regular old name, Sonny is perfectly fine. You can name your dog whatever you want! There's no difference between Sunny and Sonny besides spelling, so you can certainly name her Sonny if you want. I think it's cuter on a girl than on a boy.|`|YxGyd2yZaa	Well if your pug turns out to be a Golden/Yellow color then no, it would be cool. A tan/brown dog, yes.

28WJwHf4aa	You need a filter to help keep the pond clean. A pump is also important to keep water flowing. A fountain can be added to a pump if you are looking for the "shooting fountain" look. Waterfalls are also a good way to get water moving.     You will need chemicals to remove chlorine, as well as something to build up beneficial bacteria.    When purchasing fish, keep in mind that goldfish can grow to 24" at adult lengths.    You may want to add some type of hiding shelter if outdoor critters get a little too interested in the fish.    You can add lily bulbs, too, for a decorative look, as well as to give the goldfish shade.|`|ENQkQ6JKaa	heres all u need to know :)     http://www.geocities.com/rainforest/vine...|`|xvPsAonzaa	You'll need some mason sand to line the bottom of the hole after excavating.  If you plan on doing a large pond, you can buy rubber pond liner material and add 2' all the way around to lap the edge, place your stones or edging on this part to make it look more natural.  I always put in a pump, sometimes with a waterfall sometimes just an aerator.    You really don't need a drain as you can pump it out at the end of the season.  Good Luck.
0f3fde633bd5c269a5dc7fc600702cccaa	If this is happening randomly it might be a seizure.  No matter what the cause he needs to see the vet asap.  People here can only give you an idea of what might be wrong with your pet and not a diagnosis.  You need to see a vet for a diagnosis and a treatment plan.|`|LCIcUTwNaa	I'm not sure what could be wrong with your dog but please take it to a vet soon.It could be something just minor but you want to make sure.Good Luck.|`|ydshiNrKaa	She's trying to tell you something is wrong so take the dog to the vet and have her checked.  This is not normal behavior.|`|1e6e1a106474f7febf542c71a7f47818aa	Dog is sick, get it to a vet.|`|5rvjjaVlaa	Do you feed your dog ol'roy dog food? If so DON'T,this could be the problem.they are having a huge recall on their food,I found out the hard way.|`|f7OusW9zaa	You say she only does this 30 percent of the time?  Has it been going on for a while or did it start suddenly?    If this is something that has been going on for a little while, it sounds like she may be having seizures. Not all dogs have grand mal seizures where they fall on the floor and convulse. Some can be as mild, as just seeming to zone out for a couple of minutes, or anything in between that and grand mal seizures.    I would have her evaluated by a Vet to see if she has epilepsy or some other type of disorder that would cause her to act this way.   If it is epilepsy, she will need medication to control the seizures.|`|eua5YYYcaa	get to the vet.  We don't know what is up!!!|`|z3KqGlm8aa	HELLO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...  ITS CALLED VET PLZ HURRY DONT LET HER SUFFER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|qaLPcjIzaa	Breathing problems are never a good sign. That alone could mean several things, like fluid in or around the lungs or heart, something logged in her throat or a respiratory infection. She needs to see a vet as soon as possible, so they can quickly and accurately assign a diagnosis.    Please don't wait. Our 14 year old Pekingese had trouble breathing and upon taking her to a vet we discovered she had a bleeding tumor on her spleen, we had to put her down that day.     This isn't something to sit around and hope will go away because chances are it will get worse. See a vet. Best of luck.|`|kNx1ZoOTaa	I went online to several resources. If you keep her in a place that is very warm without proper ventilation, she could be becoming dehydrated. This is a critical situation for dogs. They must have plenty of fresh water and even small dog treats from the freezer section at your local grocery store.  She could also be suffering from a condition called distemper, in which these symptoms are displayed.This could do damage to her heart, lungs, kidneys. It can also be prevented by having her properly diagnosed, as soon as possible, so that you don't lose her. Please see a Veterinarian as quickly as possible, for Madison's sake and your peace of mind.  A concerned dog lover......Marilyn
e9gXZsKxaa	I think it's SBS (swim bladder syndrome). Does it look like his stomach is swollen, if so, then it's SBS. SBS is caused by overfeeding and the foods don't have time to digest in time. Fast him for 2-3 days, the swelling should go down. If not, give him the inside of a blanched pea, it'll help him digest the foods consumed. Three years old is nice for a betta, good job. If you take good care of him he's got 2-3 more good years.    Good luck!|`|AA11708471	Is the tank heated, filtered and atleast 5 gallons|`|Tn52aL3Zaa	well he is a bit old, but I wonder if he is having a problem with one of his "fins"?   Maybe he is a little sad. Put a mirror up to his tank.. its kind of cool what he will do! :)
yghLaVQKaa	when u are turning, make sure you arent pulling back on her mouth which will make her slow down, instead of pulling the rein back towards you, pull out away from her neck to your knee and apply preasure on the girth with your oposite leg.  if she still tries to slow down when u are turning sit lighter in the saddle and squeeze with your legs, i generally put the leg on the side i am turning towards back a little and theleg on the oposite side on the girth and turn my shoulders around the match my legs, it pushes your horse in the right direction instead of pulling around her head.    for getting her to walk on voice command, start in the trot and just do some transitions. so trot around the outside then sit deap in the saddle pull back slightly on the reins then say woah, or whatever you want to be your voice command. keep repeating this at the trot for a while, just practising going from the trot to the walk using your voice and seat (trying to use as little hands as poosible). once she has learnt the command for walk to trot, you can start on canter (i'd suggest you start with the canter after you can get her to canter when turning).    with getting on the correct lead, do what i said i do with my legs when turning. start out on a circle, lets just say you are going anti clockwise. make sure she is working nicely in the trot first then when you are ready (and you and her are both balanced) put your inside leg on the girth and your outside leg behind, i tend to block my horses movement with my outside rein, just holding it taught at his neck. i then give him the voice command and squeeze with my legs, applying more preasure with my inside leg to try and make him put that one first.    hope i helped    if you have any more q's email me :)|`|bI7wMCJXaa	You need to concentrate on your position - preferably with a trainer - to learn to keep your legs still. There's no trick, it's just training, repetition and memory muscle.    If your horse isn't going through the corners at whatever gait she's in before she gets ready to quit you need to push her on BEFORE you get to the corner. Click to her, kiss, kick her, whatever you do. She's slowing down because she can and you're not going to do anything about it.|`|qoL7LTIUaa	well theres your problem   your legs need to be stronger cuz a horse needs alot more support around corners  my suggestion lots of no stirrup work and i know you ride western but alot of two pointing for really long periods of time while trotting  sometimes it helps with the lead for them to be on a constant bend like a circle  if not on a circle make sure their body stays straight and their head is a little towards the inside   and remember that if ur picking it up from the walk there should not be any trot steps
e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	birds like chickens over heat very quickly, with out a constant cooling enviroment they are not likely to recover. I would suggest getting a pen and bringing her inside if you have AC... then try to get her to eat.. she may be too far gone to help her at this point though|`|AA11887983	Some of the things sound as if they could be related to the heat, such as the beak being open, and the not eating.  That is really hot!  But whenever birds in general start acting this way, it is not good news.  I think if there is a vet in the area it would be a good idea to phone them for advice.  It has been a long time since I treated a chicken, so any specific advice is beyond me.  It sounds like you are doing all you can, but it might be time to get some professional help.     Good luck, and I will try not to complain when it is 95 degrees around my house in August!|`|0X4UXIBvaa	Wow! It is really hot out there! Anyway, try calling a vet, I am sure they will help, they are professionals.
m4uDn0ofaa	You really should crate train your dog.  Then he will sleep in the crate at night.  He can hold his pee all night by now, he doesn't need to have access to pee pads any more thru the night if you crate train.  Just make sure you take him outside to pee before bed time, then first thing when you wake up take him outside again to pee and it should work fine.  Crates are not too pricey, you should be able to find a sutible one at Walmart for about $30 or so.  Good luck.    Added:  At his age he can hold it all night.  He has full control over his bladder muscles now.  And if he doesn't go right away you need to stay out for a few minutes with him.  If he still doesn't go then he will really have to go in the morning.  Sometimes it takes my puppy up to ten minutes out before he will go outside before bed time.  You just need to be patient.  Good Luck!|`|YxGyd2yZaa	Buy a dog crate. Your dog will not have to sleep where he eliminates, and, you won't have to worry about him at night.
ydshiNrKaa	When your dog's due date is approaching, you should begin monitoring her rectal temperature. When her temperature drops below 100o F (normal canine temperature is 101-102o F), labor may be expected within 24 hours.  The temperature has to stay down or continue to drop and not fluctuate up and down.|`|ToeeUGZUaa	Probally yes. I would start to get her a nice place with blankets and towels set up. And just to let you know, you might be up all night delivering the pups.|`|FAiOT2KTaa	it will be more of drastic drop like down to 98 or lower, she will start panting, and probably get restless, maybe start licking herself, every dog is different but those are the main things that most all dogs do, make sure you have a vets number just in case. and keep an eye on her  good luck with her.|`|gwUMipsUaa	Just have your vet on standby.  A puppy could turn at the last minute and get stuck.      You can always call your vet and ask about the temp change.
PdY9ylZCaa	that sounds a little normal to me: scurry, then pause to check out the surroundings, repeat.    if your rat is vocalizing, or not moving at all (and stays in a huddled, hunched position), or not drinking, then i'd think he's sick.|`|tjbXw3p8aa	its ******* retarded|`|AVDTZ63Oaa	Relax... I've had a rat or two over the years m'self, and they are just plain weird. If you intend to freak out every time your rat does something you don;t quite understand, there will be a LOT of sleepless nights in your future.    Check it:  That guy can hear and see things that you can not. Most specifically he (or she) can hear all sorts of high pitched noises that land outside your available listening range    Chances the little fur ball heard something, stopped, had an AHA or UH OH moment, then took a leap off the couch to get a better idea what was going on.    A sick animal will try to hide, not act goofy. You'll know when they get ill, because they kind of curl up in a corner and don;t do much. If what he's doing is running around the house acting weird, well... He's a rat. He's about as smart as a cat, and about as curious, and he uses senses you don;t even have to negotiate the world.|`|vM2o0Nicaa	Take him to the vet|`|oHbFCuGDaa	you should take him to the  vet.  they'll give you the best answer.  WISH YOU LUCK!|`|LNnRSLdtaa	hes fine!  dont take him to the vet    rodents will do this if they see something move or are unsure if the space they are in is safe    rats are prey animals. they are often the ones being hunted. so naturaly they are on guard. even if they have never been near a cat or anything like that its in there nature to be wary     my guinea pigs to it occasionally  its fine|`|28WJwHf4aa	He's not severely ill. He was just spooked by something or a sound and stopped.    ETA: Again, completely normal. I'm sure there are behaviors you've never done before but now do. You're worrying too much. He's fine!|`|0eg3Jafuaa	hold and pet him. it might calm him down but just don't let him hit his head again|`|f92f4c895d75cb0a24f4ea612297712eaa	Not sure. Sometimes my hamster does weird things. Maybe take it to the vet in the morning?|`|v0ra606Laa	Well its moving isn't it? i thought you were gonna say its laying there barely able to breath gasping his last breath. Take it to the vet if your that concerned.    Edit-So you dad wont take him to the vet cause its to expensive, you shouldn't have pets then if you cant afford to look after them, its cruel especially if there is something wrong with your rat.|`|4uI0dF0zaa	o please!!!!! you saw the happening didnt you!!|`|Cdkd4oQ7aa	I'm not a vet. He could be spooked by something. He could be having absent seizures. It's not uncommon. My dog has seizures.    If you are worried about a pet, always take it to the vet. Better safe than sorry.|`|cndj2Tksaa	Well, the first thing is that your rat might be a female and is a %50 prego. If I were you, I'd take your rat to the vet and have him/her inspected.|`|f633886f4ab9993e966868c8e49ab87baa	I don't know about rats, but when some people get seizures they just freeze for a few moments.|`|jX7IpxRlaa	no but you should take it to a vet|`|9MO6Iu1laa	spazzums it happens|`|zmlIaSGiaa	Well he is either really scared about something. If not he could be sick, if you have a medicine syringe try feed him some light sugar water. If he stops moving, or has slow breathing, take him to the vet or phone the vet if you can't get there.|`|EaRkW5fXaa	I'm pretty sure it's nothing. Rats tend to be a little neurotic sometimes. I know mine is. Really, if he keeps acting strange bring him to a vet for a check up. Also know that rats don't really have a very long life expectancy so if it is more than 2 or three years old it's about his time, not to be insensitive. GOOD LUCK!|`|M8xuWUEaaa	maybe it's excercising..i dont know.  i have a little pug dog, and sometimes she stops...and start running around at full speed in circles..then stop...and would do it again.  she's not sick or anything. maybe your rat needs to run around? o.o  if it's in a cage or something thrn maybe that's why..it needed to stretch its legs...but take him to the vet just in case
iiNAJfGCaa	You said it yourself: it's probably back soreness. You can test for this by running your thumb and forefinger down her spine, starting at her withers and going to her coup. Press firmly. If she flinches, then she probably has back pain from a poor fitting saddle. She knows that the pain starts when the saddle is put on and she is beginning to resent getting tacked up.     Some part of it may also just be "marish" behavior. Do you tighten her girth all at once or do you do it gradually? I would suggest putting the saddle on and letting it sit for a little bit. Then put the girth on, but buckle it loosely. After a few minutes tighten it a few more holes and then right before you get on tighten it the rest of the way. This way it isn't as uncomfortable for her and she won't resent having her girth tightened as much.|`|bI7wMCJXaa	The  1 answer you're going to get is poor fitting saddle or sores. You didn't say if you checked that or not. That's what 99% of the people looking at your question are going to say.|`|5TCewPYRaa	Hmm I've noticed that too this winter--my 3 yr old, who is normally an angel for everything, is beginning to back up and move around while I tighten the girth--I'm beginning to think its because he has a furry belly--so the hair is prolly sticking--he has a sheep wool girth in the mail right now--I think the neoprene is too sticky for the winter anyways...    Check your saddle pad after a ride---if there are spots that have substantially more dirt on them, those parts are most likely pinching...check for girth sores--there will either be no hair or heat and swelling..      Also try doing it one hole at a time and in sessions---put the saddle on and pull the girth up just enough so that the saddle wont fall off if she moves, then do something else--like wrap her legs and then go back and tighten it another hole...I like to finish tightening the saddle outside of the barn    Also make sure to "pull out the pinchies" by picking up her front legs and pulling them to a 90 degree angle straight out in front of her (obviously one at a time!), which will stretch out all the bunches of hair or skin folds which may have formed from the tightening of the girth---do this every time to tighten the girth. It can help with preventing girth sores ---Heck you probably already do this, but how  do I know??|`|B6zl0AJDaa	A LOT of horses become girthy (Or Cinchy) because they are cinched up too tight and too fast.    Take your time and set the saddle on her back and loosely cinch it up, then walk her around and cinch her up a little bit more.  Then do it again.    Check her back to see if it's sore (Run your fingers along side her back bone.).  Then check her girth area for galls.|`|BkJ7pxQZaa	She's still new to you, slow down when saddling and just spend sometime with her, in and out of saddle.|`|at7LXbEfaa	Well you shpould check your saddle is fitting. Maybe her back hurts or something?  if she trys nipping you u will need to get rough with her|`|j2yLjm6Naa	My horse was like this when we first got her also, with her it was because she was used to being cinched ( weastern ) so tight that she would flatten her ears, and suck up her stomache so the girth couldn't be tight. however she dosent do this anymore, I GUESS ITS JUST SOMETHING THAT THEY GROW OUT OF|`|qgAWMJeKaa	Well my horse was a little girthy a few weeks ago, check the girth area and make sure there isnt anything bothering her such as a those prickly things that stick to stuff or a piece of dirt, especially if your horse has a thick winter coat, so my advice would be take a baby wipe or something and wipe the girth area and brush it very well, maybe clip it and make sure it there is no sores, so  maybe lay off riding for a week or so. hope i helped  :)|`|253749a8c740b2b9ceb438a7f88d0d44aa	If you've checked all your equipment, she may just be testing you. I had one that did that. She would try everyone at least once or twice.|`|BIR9olyxaa	Her back may hurt. Also, to prevent girthiness, you can girth up a few holes at a time, rotating between sides.|`|uNIHqmH8aa	Yes, do check the saddle and all things of that nature. If it has nothing to do with that, get a vet out. It may have t do with her back.    -Nov|`|Xobbmd7Saa	Is the saddle not fitting? Try using a fuzzy girth. Check the saddle and girth for burrs and clean both of them thoroughly. Make sure you don't pinch the girth when you tighten it.    Use clean saddle pads that are large enough and see if he possibly needs a wither relief pad.
fOLO4TNhaa	If your talking about shelters and the hundreds of dog a day they euthanize..Once they put the animal down they put it in a trash bag then they throw it in a dumpster by the end of the day when the dumpster is full people pick the dumpster up and go to a land fill then bury them all there.|`|xkzkCtrUaa	Usually when an animal dies, it is burned into ash..and yeah. But you can request before it is done to have the body so you can put it in a dog cemetery|`|64dbb28e46e49a5128e72f8e50eb883eaa	Cremated unless otherwise requested.|`|ltP1gO4taa	Most likely they are collected by the local animal control and cremated in an incinerator.    By the way, generally speaking, even if you are paying for a cremation you CANNOT have your pet cremated by itself.  The cost of heating the incinerator is too great to do it once for each dog.  They cremate them several at a time and just give each owner a scoop of the ashes.|`|76nTvO4iaa	To the landfill where I live, if you opt to have the vet dispose of the body.    I take my dogs home and put them on the porch for an hour or so so the remaining dogs understand that their friend is no longer living.  Then I take the body to the crematorium and they deliver the ashes back to me within 2 days.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	either to a dump or are cremated together or a rendering plant|`|ydshiNrKaa	Most of them are sent to a crematory.|`|672a1d6963ce82f0b4946e0e58bceb5faa	That depends on the owner.    If the owner wants to take the body for burial home, they can give the body back.    if the owner wants a private cremation so they can spread or keep the ashes, then that's what will happen.    if the owner does not wish to have the body back, the pet will be cremated with other pets of whom the owners did not want the bodies, and the ashes will be disposed of accordingly.    East Dallas: You're very very beyond wrong. I worked at an Emergency vet clinic as a technician and as an assistant at a day clinic.    Private cremations are available to all clients, even as small as a hamster... and yes they are private. I was in charge of the crematory when I was on duty at the day clinic. (we had our own.) we never cremated with other animals if it was a private cremation.    And at the E.R. there was a crematory we subcontracted with that did private cremations for all species of animals.    also, I don't know where you all live, but here it's illegal to dump an animal carcass in the dumps.    if the owner does not take the body home for burial... the pets left behind MUST be cremated and then properly disposed of.|`|AA11887983	It depends on where you have the pet euthanized.  In my area, there are several businesses that provide both individual and group cremations for pets.  The individual pets cremated remains are returned to the owners.  The group remains are either buried in a plot at a pet cemetary, or in a wooded area near the other place.  I think you would have to ask the particular place that is handling the disposal.  As for the previous poster,  I don't think that it is legal to just dump pets at a dump.  That would pose a significant health risk, and would be against most city ordainances.
qu7DSLTqaa	This is common. Our last dog had a leaky bladder, so when we adopted another one that leaked, we knew what to do! Get her to the vet. They will test for a bladder infection. If she has one, they will give antibiotics. If after the infection is cleared up she is still leaky, there is medicine they can give. Our dog gets one pill (Proin) a day. It runs just under $20 every 2 months--well worth it!  The pills are flavored and the vet said most dogs take them like treats...neither of ours liked them! I bought a pill crusher at the drugstore and put it in her dinner with a splash of water to make it stick to her food...(with s sprinkle of parmesan cheese!)  Is your dog being treated for her seizures? I don't know if that has anything to do with the weak bladder (is it only after a seizure?). I would ask your vet.|`|ad09a262eea23aed99f3309da57c67c5aa	This is normal after seizures.  Treat the seizures and the urine leakage will most likely go away too.  Some spayed dogs can become urine incontinent which causes leakage.  Urinary tract infections can also cause the same issue.  Talk to your vet about proper diagnosis and treatments for your dog.|`|gwUMipsUaa	This is common.      If this dog is old, it might be her time to go.  If this is the case, it's more humane to let her go, as this will only increase.  My first dog was 14, and started having seizures, so we knew it was his time to go.|`|6yoCcGBWaa	It's very common for dogs to lose bladder control during and after a seizure.  And as females dogs age, they can also become incontinent.    Check with your vet about treatment, as it's possible hormones could control the incontinence and maybe she needs some seizure control meds as well.    And then, there are always doggie diapers.|`|AA11171398	During the seizure she can't help it, she has no control of her body. I'd say just make sure she goes out as often as possible.

It's a fact, but I don't know how common it is for smaller primates to do it.    I don't think it's because people don't like monkeys--it's just that they aren't suitable for pets--they are a wild animal that deserves to BE in the wild.  There are a lot of exotic animals that have been 'domesticated', like rabbits and ferrets and chinchillas.  For some of these, yes, they have wild relatives, but the ones people buy/adopt/rescue today are completely dependent on humans for care (how long would a startlingly white rabbit survive?  How would an Americanized ferret live?  They wouldn't).      A monkey isn't like that, and they shouldn't be forced into a domestic situation when they aren't built for it.|`|Rx8U8eVnaa	Since never.|`|9z5NASypaa	I love monkeys they are my favourite, esp orang utans. Though I have seen them throwing poops before, Ive seen it on AFV and you tube. But I dont care I still love them!|`|4SQx8smEaa	What is wrong with some festive poop throwing?? LOL|`|u3Hdoeiqaa	Monkeys are great - cute, inquisitive, funny, clever..... I love them all!    But why on earth would anyone want to keep one as a pet?    Seriously, you want the truth about monkeys??? The real bad stuff? I have spent a lot of time working with various primate species and have experienced plenty of stuff most people would freak out about.    Many monkey species DO throw poop. Even if they don't throw it they poop everywhere. I have seen them eat it, smear it around the walls....    It's not just poop either. I have had a number of monkeys deliberately attmept to pee in my face. I have seen monkeys hump eachother / jerk themselves or eachother off and then eat their semen or smear it around the walls. I have seen female monkeys doing the same with menstrual blood. Many monkey species scent mark - by rubbing pee on everything they touch.    Monkeys might look sweet, but most become aggressive as they reach maturity. Depending on the species they can hit, pinch, pull hair, bite, scratch etc and some can cause serious injuries.    There are also the disease risks. New world monkeys (like marmosets) can be killed by the herpes simplex virus (coldsores). Most monkeys carry some form of "food poisoning" bacteria such as campylobacter. They can also carry such lovely things as Shigella, herpes B virus, and even rabies.    They are also noisy, smelly and incredibly destructive. I have known monkeys destroy a purpose built toy in under an hour, or strip off "monkey proof" wall coverings costing thousands in a couple of days.    Even if monkeys didn't have all these wonderful characteristics they are extremely difficult to properly care for. They need a huge amount fo space - probably the size of a normal living room, lots of enrichment, the company of other monkeys, a complex diet, specialist vet care, a huige amount of time for interaction and training..... Very few people have the time, space, money, expertise or dedication to actually care for a monkey properly.    Like I said at the start, I love monkeys - they are fantastic characters. But the "bad crap" is the reality.

672a1d6963ce82f0b4946e0e58bceb5faa	have you seen any of these signs...    * Bad breath  * Drooling saliva (may be tinged with blood)  * Loss of appetite  * Difficulty chewing food  * Mouth pain (pawing at mouth or rubbing side of face on the floor)  * Red, inflamed gums  * Receding gums, showing exposed tooth root  * Yellow or brown deposits on teeth at the edges of the gums  * Inability to close mouth    if the answer is yes to the any of the above, and the fact that your cat has lost teeth... go to the vet so they can thouroughly inspect the teeth and gums.    it could be feline ondoclastic resorptive lesion. This condition is due to gingivitis and causes the teeth to form a cavity and then ware away, although this happens more in older cats (5 and up.)    either way you need to talk to your vet about what is happening with the gums, and get a diet plan going to get the weight down.    overweight cats are at serious risk for diabetes and other health conditions    1. you need to see the vet. If you can't afford it work out a payment plan or go to the humane society. They have vets who will either do it at a discount or pro bono. there are always options.    your cat being overweight will cause the cat to be at risk for diabetes. He may not be sick now.. but down the line I'm not so sure.     also, losing teeth that young is not normal, so your cat has an issue.    2. you should be feeding a high quality food like Felidae, Blue Buffalo cat, or Innova cat. meow mix is like feeding your cat Big macs every day.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	First get him to the vet.

Steroid injections usually don't last longer than a month, even for long-acting formulations, and that's not the safest treatment especially for an older kitty, although sometimes it is necessary.  You may need more testing or a referral to a veterinary specialist.

ltP1gO4taa	I think you're right about it being a dominance issue.  Part of the biting is teething and will subside somewhat over time.  In the meantime I would recommend you get some puppy appropriate chew toys.    This is how I would deal with the humping and biting.  When she starts humping or biting give her a firm "NO!", turn your back and fold your arms.  wait about 30 seconds before you start playing again.  If she does it again you should leave the room for a minute or two, then return and continue playing.  The message you are sending is that humping or biting is not acceptable and she won't get your attention if she does this behavior.    As far as her coming when you call, she's only 10 weeks old you need to lower your expectations JUST A LITTLE.  Recall (getting your dog to come every time you call) is one of the HARDEST skills to teach a dog to do consistently.    Here's a method for laying the foundation for consistent recall:  Call your dog's name.  When she makes eye contact with you say "Yes!" and give her a treat.  Do this all the time.  Practice it when you are walking, playing, just sitting around, any time at all.  Also say "Yes!" and give her a treat, along with praise, any time she comes to you.  This technique can work for creating all kinds of new behaviors.  For more info Google 'Marker Training'.    Make sure that when your dog comes to you it is ALWAYS a positive experience.  NEVER and I mean NEVER call your dog to you to discipline her.  If she needs to be corrected, go to her.    When she's 8 months old have her spayed.|`|ZhrL1Vszaa	show her whos boss, when she shows aggression even a little, hold her w ur body weight(don't hurt her), till she's submissive, she will stop the leg humping, that's what the trainer told my friend to do w his wolf mix|`|lvfPrS6saa	It is a dominance issue.You have to make her stop.I would try sound diversion.Put a few pennies in a plastic bottle.When she's doing something you don't want her to and you can't get her attention shake the bottle hard and she will look up.Then you reward her.Also,to get up and turn your back to her and totally ignore her.When she gives up and walks away or turns her attention away from you,reward her.Always reward her for all good behavior and ignore her when she acts out. If she responds to you when she knows you have food,shes  food driven.I would reward her with food and lots of overly excited praise that may make you look stupid,but they respond to it.|`|0QN7xDNeaa	Ugh, it's a normal dog thing!!! And yes, sometimes they do it to try and show dominance but most of the time they're just being their goofy dog selves. So don't freak out about it unless it's persistant over a VERY long period of time. If it's really that annoying to you, hire a dog trainer.|`|WNB4Vojsaa	buy a halloween dog costume|`|bb60640c96610ff5b7eb5df5251f191caa	Your puppy is 10 weeks old, puppies nip because that's how puppies play. You need to teach them that its not acceptable to play with humans that way. As soon as her teeth touch skin you get up, fold arms and stare at the ceiling for a minute. After a minute go back to play and offer a toy to sink her teeth into, praise when she does. If she starts with attention getting behaviors when you ignore (barking, nipping, whining) ignore her until she's calm for at least 3 seconds then go back to play.     As for the humping, not all humping is dominance related, dominance related humping is in fact on the bottom of the list for reasons dogs do this. They also do it during play, when they are stressed or overstimulated. Again simply tell her No and redirect her to a chew toy. This will help her learn acceptable outlets for her excitment.     I would highly recommend enrolling in a puppy class to help you learn about your dog and get training off to a good start. Puppy classes also help with very critical socialization at this age.|`|RFfTjnxzaa	Spaying is not going to stop humping or her biting. It might make her hump-crazy and more aggressive and dominant.    You need to show her that YOU are the pack leader. When she humps, pull her off with a sharp and firm "No". Scold for multiple offenses. And if she really won't get the point, stop whatever you're doing with her and ignore her for a while. She should understand after her humping brings these results a few times.    As for the biting, when she bites, hold her mouth closed with your hand, saying "no" firmly. Don't squeeze, just hold her mouth closed. If she starts whining, don't let go (make sure you're not squeezing her, though). Let go when you're ready to. She should soon understand that biting = getting her mouth shut for a minute.|`|xKcphGWIaa	she wants doggy, looooooooooooooooool xD|`|ctLfOu4Baa	its natural|`|9MO6Iu1laa	Definitley get that thing neutered!|`|ui5uEr5Oaa	she likes you and shows it by trying to show affecction|`|FL0S2tSCaa	she wants u|`|65G38NZAaa	She's just like a little kid, she doesn't see you having much authority.

If there is absolutely no white, and especially if the cere is a nice pink, and well rounded, then the baby is probably male.    To teach any parrot to talk is quite simple.   Simply repeat the same word/phrase over & over a few times each day  the best time to teach talking is just before dusk    training other tricks are also simple repetition but use a special food treat as a reward (fruit, veggies, crackers)    you should start with something simple and build on it  eg: Talking- start with 'Hello' when learnt add 'how are you?'    trick start with getting birdie to stand on you hand for a treat  then move on to calling birdie until birdie flies to you for a treat     just remember like training any pet it takes time, patience and practice

4yt4D3vMaa	I'm sorry to hear that happened when your cat was just 12 but you did the right thing-once they start being sick and stop eating and drinking it means they have a lot of toxins in their system which means their kidneys have pretty much packed in. Your vet will have seen lots of cases of kidney disease and kidney failure so if he had thought there was a chance he would have said.you timed it right as it's not nice to see them getting weaker and sicker-she was happy and purring so you saved her from suffering and can remember her like that instead of in pain and discomfort.i just wish we had been brave enough to make that decision for our cat when her kidneys failed-we left it a bit too long and will always regret that.|`|yAsLhdp2aa	you did the right thing..there is no cure for kidney failure unless you want to spend thousands in an experiment and put her through a transplant. That is not realistic in this day and age. Cats can be in kidney failure for many years because by the time the blood test can diagnose failure, 75% of the function is already gone. She probably had next to no kidney function.  If you ever see a person go through organ failure, it is painful. Cats hide pain by nature, if they were to show it, in the wild (they were originally wild, undomesticated animals) they would be somebody's next meal...Cats do not always purr when they are happy, they purr when they are scared and painful too.  So if she was already acting sick, and not eating only compromises her kidneys even further,  she more than likely was not going to get better.|`|HRvPoQzKaa	I'm sorry for your lost :( I went through the same thing.    It was a right choice, sweetie :)    Animals suffer just like humans do.

Some cats can live a long time with kidney disease, with only a change in diet.  Some cats have a sudden onset of illness and never recover.  If your pet was that ill, she really would have needed several days of hospitalization until you could have an idea of whether it would work or not.  I think that your decision was made with your cat's quality of life in mind, and that is all that you can do.  Sure, you may never know for sure if she would have done ok, but at least she is not hurting.  Sometimes that is all that we can give them.  Don't regret your decision to make her comfortable.  Sorry about your loss.|`|0accd20a753414614a02981356511fc6aa	YOU DID DO WHAT YOU COULD ,, YOU LOVED HER, THATS ALL THEY ASK.

I'm never sure if it's right or wrong. I just know I would hate to make the decision. I have my cat on distilled water because she has kidney issues. The lack of intake suggests she was shutting herself down. Kidneys can be very sensitive organs in being able to get them functioning again. Maybe another vet would have had another view but if you trust who you had, you may have done the best you could. My first cat had kidney problems too, at about 5, but she somehow got better. She might have gotten into something like paint or turpentine or something that affected her health then.     All I can say is that doing research on such issues and asking questions is probably the best you can do.|`|OngsAj6Kaa	i know you're sad, but she was in pain, and i doubt you could have done anything for her. i think it was better for her.|`|4pDpAKHwaa	I'm so sorry to hear about your cat, but I think you did the right thing.

We have had several cats whose kidneys began to fail. It is actually the leading cause of death in cats - either they die from it or they are euthanized because of it.    The decision to euthanize a cat with whom you've lived for 12 years is never easy - it was probably the hardest decision you have ever had to make.    What can be done for a cat with kidney failure (called CRF - Chronic Renal Failure) depends upon the condition of the kidneys.    CRF is detected by measuring the levels of a few things in the blood. The most common are BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen) and Creatinine.    When the levels of these two things are found to be above normal levels, it is caused by the kidneys beginning to become non functional.    What can be done for a cat with CRF depends upon how far gone the kidneys are - that is, how soon after the kidneys stat to fail the condition is diagnosed.    It is possible to treat cats with CRF unless their kidneys are too damaged.    One thing that you can do for a CRF cat at home is give them subcutaneous fluids - that is, inject fluids into them under their skin.    The procedure is actually fairly simple and most people can learn to do it easily.    It is done with an IV bag of fluids (usually Lactated Ringers Solution), an IV tubing set, and a fairly large needle.    You must handle everything carefully so as to not contaminate the fluid.    You take the "stopper" out of the IV bag and insert the IV tube end into the bag.    You then put a needle on the other end of the IV tube set.    You get the cat in a comfortable position and you pull up the skin over their shoulders and  you slide the needle into the skin so that it is just under the skin - hence the term subcutaneous which means 'under the skin"    You then open the valve on the IV tubing set and you allow about 100 ml of the fluid to flow into the cat. You can squeeze the IV bag to speed up the process. I can get 100 ml of fluid under a cat's skin in about 30 seconds. If you let it drip in, it can take several minutes.    Yes, I know - this sounds like something you couldn't or wouldn't do or something that hurts the cat.    The truth is that just about anyone can learn the procedure and the only pain the cat feels is when the needle is first inserted.    The needle is very sharp and it goes through the skin very easily and quickly and after that there is no pain.    Once the needle is in place, all the cat feels is the fluids building up under their skin.    By the way, you warm the IV bag before doing this so that the fluid is not cold and causes any discomfort for the cat.    Have you every had an IV? The first one I ever had was 6 years ago when I had a heart attack. I was surprised that once the needle was in place there was no pain and I bearly felt the needle. I guess I had assumed that it would hurt until the needle was removed.    It didn't and know I know that when I give a cat subcutaneous fluids they don't feel anything once the needle is in place.    I gave one of our CRF cats, named Digby, fluids like this for almost 2 years.    This and other treatment such as the monitoring of various blood compounds - such as potassium - and supplements for those that are low and drugs to counteract those that are too high, can give a CRF cat a few more relatively healthy years.    There comes a time, however, when the CRF becomes too much and you must make the decision to let the cat go.    I cannot tell you whether any of this might have helped your cat for a while. I don't know the actual results of the blood tests nor how sick or weak she was.    Given that she had not eaten or drunk in days, her CRF was probably quite advanced and the possibility of improvement with treatment was probably quite low.    The cost of the treatment is really not very high provided you have an experienced vet and are willing to take a very active part in the treatment.    Just to give you an idea, I can purchase a 1000 ml bag of Lactated Ringers Solution - with a prescription - for about $2.50. The IV tubing costs about $1.80 and needles are $7.00 for 100.    A 1000 ml IV bag of fluids will provide 10 treatments of 100 ml. A new needle is used each time and a new IV tubing set it used for each IV bag.    Blood tests to monitor things can run upwards of $80 each time but the interval depends upon the subject symptoms which can be observed.    Costs could be around $12.00 per month for the subcutaneous fluids, tubing, and needles.    Blood work would likely not be done more often than once a month, so the total monthly cost might be say $100 plus any other medications.    Depending upon how the cat behaves, its appetite and such, blood work might not be necessary every month.    Whether that is prohibitively high is a decision for everyone to make  ---------------------  MY ANSWER WAS TRUNCATED,  HERE IS THE END      I was saying that the decision of whether a particular treatment is too much is a decision that must be made by the person involved.    I also said that the last thing I wanted to do was cause you any worry over your decision.    From what you said, the cat not eating and drinking for days, the CRF was probably very advanced and you made the correct decision.    I also said that the pain will lessen day by day.    It will be easier, as the days go by, to think of her without the tears starting.    There will c|`|zto6BEwaaa	I recently lost one of my cats to hepatic lipidosis, or fatty liver syndrome. He was a perfectly healthy 2-year old cat who randomly stopped eating and drinking, and began to throw up constantly. Once he was diagnosed blood tests, my vet instructed me to force feed him every two hours. I stopped everything in my life to take care of him and help him recover, but it was to no avail. He was incoherent and absolutely fatigued. It was heartbreaking to watch him try to walk around my apartment, because it took all of the energy he had. I asked the vet if it would be best to put him to sleep, but all of us thought that he had more fight in him. Two weeks into recovery, he passed away in my arms.      To this day, I feel like maybe there was something that I could have done differently, or maybe had I taken better care of him he never would have fallen ill in the first place. When it comes down to it, there really was nothing I could have done, and it is detrimental to get caught up in negative thinking.    Making the decision to put an animal to sleep is never easy. I wish you the best as you go through this difficult time. It is understandable that you feel regretful, but try to remember all of the love you gave your kitty, and how wonderful it was to give her a good, loving home for so many years.

In dog years this equals approximately 14 human years.  Although it is not exact they generally calculate 1 human year to equal 7 dogs years, so a dog of 5 is 35, a dog of 8 is 56 and so on.|`|RFfTjnxzaa	It really depends on the breed. Large breeds don't reach full adulthood until 1.5-2 years old. Smaller breeds usually are fully developed by 1-1.5 years.|`|AA10113390	2 years|`|ZtP0dobmaa	when it doesnt get any bigger...|`|DYxb7P3Baa	they reach adulthood when they're about 2years old . and i think every 1 dog year is 7 human years so if your dog is 2 years old, its 14 in human years . xD

5IcNNkkuaa	YOU need to be the pack leader, and the dominant one.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Yes, dogs are pack animals.  They have one is the leader & dominant.  You should be first then dominant dogs  next other dogs.  They don't understand  sharing  or equal rights s- that is a human traits.|`|qrwaA0toaa	It is alright under 2 conditions-  1. The Dominant dog knows you are dominant over her  2.The other dogs will get down low and submit to her|`|eua5YYYcaa	You must remember you are the alpha dog first and foremost.    Animals are like people in many ways.  They all have a pecking order.    In my house my older dog who is very laid back is the alpha dog.  We can tell b/c if the younger one does something the older one doesn't like he lets him know he didn't like it.    Other than that the younger one is more playful and bothers the older one all day long!    We were also advised by our vet that we should always let the dogs workout their struggles unless it is dangerous.
bnJLKQWMaa	I also have a Pembroke Welsh Corgi who is now 2, she is a tri (meaning 3 colours) as well.  I usually name my dogs from the country they come from, so it a good fit for their breed.    My dog's name is Dilys (like Phyllis but with a D) it means genuine, which she really is.    Why don't you look up some welsh baby names that would fit her, it will certainly be unique.  If you want to use Dilys, I don't mind.  I also like Gwen as it doesn't sound to prissy.    Good luck and get your pup trained, they are so easy to train and love it.  Best wishes|`|gwUMipsUaa	And neither can we.  The only unique or special names your dog will have is the one you give her.  Name her something in a foreign language.  Maybe name her something in Welsh.  Look up English to Welsh translations.|`|PM23RDycaa	http://www.20000-names.com/ - more names than you can shake a stick at.|`|RyQsmWWgaa	Bellatrix( Bella or Trixie for short), Galadriel(Gabby for short), Piper, Pru, Isadora, Celeste, Criket, Grace, Skylar, or Herminoe!!!|`|tPGxPDvBaa	try this dog name site - they have thousands under different categories so you can choose something you like that you might not had thought of.    http://www.lowchensaustralia.com/Names.h...|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	Dont be in a rush for a name. Sit down look at the pup really observe her. Where did you get her? try coming up with something simular. Look at her Pedigree see what she has in the past, see if you can make a combo of her mom and dads name. Take your favorite song right now, or movie, or author, or book. Watch what she likes to do the most, naughty or good. Come up with something like that.   I have 6 dogs they all have pretty unique names to there personalities.    Sigmond - cause my ex wanted to call him Psycho and I didnt like that so we went with the mentalist Sigmound Freud.   Angus - (Cardigan Welsh Corgi by the way) He was named for Angus Podgourny who was a Welsh Character on Monty Pythons Flying Circus  Morgandy - (Also a Cardigan Welsh Corgi Tri-color) Her mother was imported from Wales near a place called Morgandy. Thats how we got  it.  Indiana - my nephew named her cause she could traverse any obsticle like Indiana Jones the adventurer.   Casablana - cause she was saved from Casablanca Morocco (North Africa) I thought it fit her.  Peekaboo - was always hiding her head behind a couch and scared all the time. It was a great name for her.      So try things like that to name her. Dont just pick a silly name with no meanings.|`|VwmaWcp9aa	See the site listed below.

zWFJBlJZaa	Not all dogs are natural swimmers. Some will be naturals and others will sink like a stone.    Best thing to do  if you're going to use your pool is to wrap a towel under her belly and hold the two ends up above her body and dip her into the pool and see if she starts kicking her legs ("running" in the water).  If so, drop one end of the towel and let her at it.  If she's not moving those legs, she'll need to be taught. The reason for the towel is that you don't want to be too close when the feet start going or you're going to get all scratched up.    But even better is to take her to the nearest beach and walk along the sand and see if she'll play with the waves.  If she does then roll up your jeans and walk her in.  When the bottom starts to drop out she should start to swim, and if not, you'll be able to walk her right back onto shore.    Here's a funny story for you.  I had a Lab/Great Dane mix and my sister had a Chihuahua.  Dad took us all to the beach and in the car we were discussing how the dogs had never been swimming and my Dad said, "Well, the Chihuahua is scared of his own shadow so he won't swim, but the other one will."  When we got to the beach I went tearing off to the water with the L/GD mix in tow and as soon as the wave lapped up on his feet, he put on the brakes and left rump marks in the sand.  World's Largest Living Sand Sculpture!!!    My sister rolled up her jeans and heeled the Chihuahua into the water and he swam at heel position just as pretty as a picture. LOL!!!|`|gwUMipsUaa	Swimming depends on the dog itself.  Some like it, some don't.  It's not a breed, or in this case, mutt, issue.    My dog is a Toy Poodle.  Some love swimming, some hate it.  Mine hates it.  And yes, like one poster said, your dog will die if he gets in the pool when you aren't looking.|`|AA10025824	Dogs are able to swim instinctively.|`|oiBGMHcBaa	All dogs can swim but the Bichon Frise prefers to avoid water. They are more of a lap-dog type=).  You can try to train him/her to swim but I do not guarantee you nothing.  Good Luck.  P.S Bichons are very cute and so are Shih Tzu's!|`|W0buucLsaa	It doesn't matter - dogs usually can't GET OUT of pools (they don't have arms y'know), which is why they drown in them often. You need to put up a fence or guard or whatever they're called around the perimeter of your pool. She might be able to swim in it, but she won't be able to paddle around for hours.|`|xi9amEG2aa	I've only made my dog swim once...and that was only because she had slipped out of her collar at my moms, and was out running for a couple hours in the summer.  I knew she wouldn't like the water, but she looked like she was about to fall over and pass out whenever she came back, so I got in the pool with her, and cooled her down...which it worked pretty good.  But anyways, I held her and walked along with her when she was in the pool so she didn't scratch the lining of the pool and so we could lift her out when she got to the other end.  My mom's Basset Hound jumped right in when she was about 3 years old because she didn't know what it was....and now she knows that she doesn't like it.     Just make sure that if she does jump in on her own, that you are already in the pool to catch her and make sure she comes up for air right away.  If she does like it, then just be careful that she doesn't go up there all by herself, keep the steps up (if it's an above ground pool).  If she doesn't like it, don't force her, she'll figure out what you're trying to do and stay away.|`|f3f09dd5dab69f7e644b37c4cf98a3abaa	I'm sure it will depend on if it wants to get wet.  Labs swim because they are water retrievers and it is bred in them.    Pools however are tough on dog because they can't get out so it could actually be quite dangerous.|`|qrwaA0toaa	Is it a small dog or  big dog? I'm pretty sure all dogs are excellent swimmers. Big dogs can swim great, but im not too sure about small ones.|`|672a1d6963ce82f0b4946e0e58bceb5faa	I have a bichon shih tzu mix and he swims very well... doggy paddles come naturally, but you'll need to supervise him very, VERY carefully.|`|9VqUC9Haaa	I have studied all dog types.... there are originally 5 types of bichons.....(and yes they, mixed together will result in a small dog!) The one that hasoriginated to the bichon we know today is the Bichon havinese... my bichon (Binky) is a natural swimmer ( because the breed bichon is a cross between a poodle and a maltese, an excellent choice, for the Maltese daintiness, and the poodles ability to swim, hunt and do amazing sport). When you are training your dog to swim, start on the first step of the pool then the second, so on and so forth.. DO NOT just throw it in there... it will panic and will never like the water again. You have to show the dog how much fun it is to swim and that its safe. This is the way I trained my dog, and he'll get mad at me if I don't take him swimming. Now the shitzu are excellent swimmers to... almost all dogs love to swim, but mix these two breeds together, you've got an excellent swimmer. I hope I helped!|`|3ab0562924ae58daee1fe664ccc36a9daa	Some dogs can swim like its second nature to them and others can't and wont. You can have one dog that's the same breed as the other and one may love water and the other may hate it.   So one way to do it is to introduce her to water right away as a pup but don't make it scary for her talk to her calmly and support her so she doesn't go under she may or may not be comfortable with it but work with her on it slowly a little bit each day and never force her to swim. It's not a grantee that she will like water some dogs just don't care for it.
w4DIPHf1aa	Don't put anytime into a temporary tank like that....    You might as well get them the minimum size tank they need which about 50 gallons right away.    you were planning to do that? your not that retarded you planned to keep them in that tank more than a few months?|`|m0e3a3gWaa	This is normal with the dolomite.  Do a few extra water changes and it will clear up.  The 10 gallon is fine for now, but in a few weeks you will need to upgrade to a larger tank or you will just have 1 fish left!  With the fish you mentioned you will need a 55 gallon.  Have fun with the cichlids, their awesome.|`|MeVmm0NEaa	That is insane.  The size of these fish is partly an issue, but cichlids have a HUGE bio-load.  You are going to cause these fish harm keeping them this way, if not just kill them off.  You need a much more powerful filter on a much larger tank.  Why would you do this?  Obviously you had to look up a few things on cichlids to know to use crushed coral.

There are a number of species native to South Africa, but I don't know anybody who has any of them (even though I belong to two cichlid clubs).|`|zEES49hhaa	African Cichlids do not eat plants, plants are not even in their natural habitat.  They will however, dig them up and uproot them so you need something to anchor them down. (especially if you have a sand bottom)  As far as what type of plants you need to go with your lighting, and PH.  If you have a higher PH (Cichlids are accustom to a higher one) then make sure you get plants that thrive in that type of environment.

He is a 'runt' and will probably die unless you take special care of him.  If there are many puppies, divide them into two groups and only let one group be near momma at a time. Rotate every six hours or so. If one group is overall bigger and healthier than the others, mix it up a bit.   This will ensure that all puppies are granted equal access to the nipples, and that bigger puppies do not shove tiny puppies out of the way.    Breathing funny = it can be vet time now.

There's too many dorky names out there that nobody gave any effort into making.  My mares name origainally was Big Asset.  How dumb is that? lol    I also had a Appy/TB named Hollywood Showdown and a Fjord named The Last Viking.  That was really creative of me because Fjords were used for the vikings back in the day.  I used to give all the non-registered horses shownames back in the day, it was lot's of fun.|`|iiNAJfGCaa	I think he's cute! He has decent conformation and from what I can see of the first photo, it looks like he is built a little uphill (his withers higher than his rump) which is actually good for jumping. His legs aren't disproportionate for his size and he has a nice thick neck (which I personally prefer, especially in my jumpers).  With the right conditioning and muscling, I think the sky will be the limit for you two. The one thing I would say is watch that you saddle isn't too far forward... Your guy has a big shoulder (I'm betting a big stride too!) and the front part of your saddle should behind that shoulder or else you will prohibit his movement. In the first photo the saddle is too far up. Trace the top of his shoulder back with you hand. The saddle should rest right where his shoulder meets his ribcage.|`|XL62syrCaa	well I am not big on show names sorry.    but as for conformation (even the old pictures) he is not built for jumping. He has short legs and a long back and the picture where he is being ridden he is over bent at the poll and not properly collected. He is obviously WAY overweight. He has a nice face but he definitely wouldnt win any conformation competitions.    Edit: If you didn't want to hear the truth don't ask the question. i know im not going to get a good rating on this question, but geez. I know horses are good horses no matter what they look like, BUT you asked about conformation and if you didn't want to hear things that are bad about your horse don't post|`|bI7wMCJXaa	If he's a gelding forget anything related to Miranda. Google "Moonshine" and see what you come up with for articles, and you might find something that rings a bell with you. For example our puppy's breeder's kennel was Trade Winds, a nautical term. So we googled nautical terms and came up with phrases to use as his registered name.    If you want his conformation judged you need to get a picture of your horse straight on from the side with his legs mostly squared without tack.

e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	usually you can not get a tank humid enough or warm and clean enough. Its best you put a different box in with some special substrate like vermiculite. have it dark and warm and one hole in the side to enter. She will likely lay in there, if she doesnt then move them into the box. Remember to mark them with an x, so you know which way they were layed. Lay them into the box exactly as you took them out. the box will have to stay a steady temp, humidity, and you will have to make sure to catch any that are rotting or molding.

You can purchase them, but they can be expensive. Hovabators are cheap and you can sometimes buy them at local pet stores or from lllreptile.com online. You can also make your own incubator from home but you would need a thermastat and flexwatt. You can also search the net for other ways to build your own incubator. The eggs should not be left w/ her. Once she is done , you need to remove them and put them in  your incubator. The eggs will need to be heated to around 88 or 90 F. here is a website that may help: http://www.ballpython.com/page.php?topic...  For substrate, you will want to either use vermiculite or perlite. Both substances you can get at a gardening or hardware store.

That could kill the fetuses.  7) Place them on top of the vermiculite, dont bury them.  8) the temperature should be kept between 87-91 F  9) The eggs should begin to hatch in 55-60 days and it will take them about 1- 1.5 days to fully hatch.  10) after they hatch, let them undergo their first shed, then try to feed them hopper mice.|`|owi3TGSBaa	KEEP THEM WITH HER UNTIL THEY HATCH AND LEAVE HER ALONE|`|SAwouzN9aa	unless you have an incubator leave them in with her but remove and slugs (bad eggs) you'll know the slugs when you see them they will be off color and smaller than the rest. Do some research on kingsnake.com or google ball python breeding there are alot of good sites with all the info you need for maternal incubation (mother incubating the eggs) or artificial incubation, out there. But start with Kingsnake.com and go from there. It would take me to long to type out everything you need to know and do if you want these eggs to survive.     I did go and take this from one of the bigger breeders websites thanks constrictors unlimited.  Breeding (crash course in brain surgery)    Well, its not exactly brain surgery, but it does take a certain amount of skill to be successful.  Entire books are written explaining husbandry and breeding, so consider this your crash course.      Your Ball Pythons should be in excellent health and of proper weight and age before breeding attempts are made.  The smallest that we have bred males is 500grams and 6 months of age.  Females are not considered for breeding unless they are in excess of 1200grams.  Providing that they are of adequate weight, females will commonly breed successfully at 18 months of age.  As with care, there are many techniques that can be employed to successfully breed Ball Pythons.  I will explain the strategies employed at Constrictors Unlimited.  Starting in October, the heat tape is turned off at night.  The ambient temperatures are allowed to drop into the low 70s.  We have our thermostats connected to photocells that turn the heat off when the sun goes down.  The lights are on relays that turn them off when the sun goes down.  This creates a very natural environment, the sun goes down, the lights go off and it gets cooler.  This also simulates a natural photo period as the day length changes.      Males are introduced into the females enclosure starting November 1st.  Courting and copulations are usually observed within hours of introduction.  November and December are usually spent running males through many females to spark the season.  Things get serious in January.  During this time, we spend hours in the morning palpating females to feel for follicular development.  The females that have started developing egg follicles get the most attention and the males are introduced into these females enclosures more often.      During the entire breeding season, pairs are separated once a week and food is offered to both the males and females.  This rest and meal time is particularly important for the males to give them the stamina to breed all season.  Many males and females will refuse to eat during this time, but it is beneficial to offer.  Getting a male to take a few mid-season meals can really make a difference in his production and keep him from getting too run down.  If your male is not eating during the season, it is critical to keep an eye on him and observe his condition.  If he loses a significant amount of weight and begins to look worn out, it is important to pull him from breeding and remove him from the scent of females.  In the wild, a male is probably lucky to encounter a couple of females.  When breeding in captivity, he is sometimes given access to a new girl everyday.  Given the choice between resting and breeding a new girl, he will almost always make the choice to breed without regard to his own well being.  There is a point of no return with regard to the males health and he will breed beyond it.  It is up to you to make a decision that he is done for the year.    Starting at the end of January, ovulations begin to be observed.  Ovulation is characterized by a significant mid-bodied swelling and a tight constriction of the top portion of the tail.  Once ovulation is witnessed, the female is considered gravid and it is no longer necessary to place a male with her.  The length of time between initial follicular development and ovulation is highly variable, from a few weeks to as much as 6 months.  A couple of weeks after ovulations, the female will shed her skin.  This is recorded as a pre-lay shed.  She will usually move the bedding around to form a nest.  Approximately 30 days after her pre-lay shed, she will lay her eggs.     Eggs    Our females will begin to lay eggs, with an average clutch size of 4 to 8 eggs, in early March.  For incubation, we create egg chambers by filling a 12qt Rubbermaid box halfway with vermiculite.  Water is added and mixed with the vermiculite just until it clumps, but no water can be squeezed out.  It is far better for this mixture to be a little too  dry, rather than overly wet.  Excess moisture will kill the eggs quickly.  If the eggs are observed denting in and they look too dry, they can easily be revived by adding water.  Once the proper mix is achieved, the eggs are placed on the vermiculite mixture and the lid is secured on the box.  We do not have any holes in the lid or the box.  There will

She is very cute and was pretty easy to train and is about 10 lbs full grown. Plus, she LOVES to cuddle and sleep with us.  I think being lovable and cuddly is a breed thing because it is the same way with the other people i know who own a shihpoo. Anyway, a word of warning... small dogs tend to be more energetic so make sure you have the energy to keep up.

f3ec8ad1fe6b502f5b654e8665449800aa	Give them each a Capstar. You can get them at most vets, you do not have to bring them in to get it. It starts working with in 30 min., and last for 24 hours. It has a very high kill rate, and should kill most of the adult fleas on them. You can use it in conjunction with Advantage with no problem. If they are really bad, give them a Capstar three times a week for two weeks. (If needed.)     As for the Advantage, it is a very good product. Do keep in mind that Advantage and Capstar only kill adult fleas. You should wait at least 24 hours to give them a bath. VERY IMPORTANT: When you bathe them you must use a detergent free (soap free) shampoo, or it will wash off the Advantage. Do not use human shampoo. Cats have a different PH than we do, and can lead to dry skin.|`|GduRpnn0aa	I would recommend that you stay away from Advantage and all the other kinds of commercial flea control stuff. They all contain chemical insecticides which can cause liver damage in both you and your cats.     Instead, do what I do and use Feline Target Spray. It is a herbal formulation, that acts as an insect repellent that deters cat fleas.     You can buy it here: http://www.petwellbeing.com/cat-fleas-p6...    Cat fleas love a warm place to live and your cat is the perfect host. They feed on your cat's blood, weakening them. Cat fleas are disease-carrying organisms that can also trigger allergic reactions in your pet. They often affect weak animals and/or those in poor health. Fleas can transfer themselves from your pet to you or to another animal and can live for up to 30 days, the typical fleas life cycle. Keeping your cats living space clean is an important part of prevention and reduction of cat flea infestation. Make sure to regularly vacuum and wash toys or blankets and cushions. Fleas harbor tapeworm eggs so getting rid of these pests will help to keep your cat safe and healthy.     Also, if you are considering bathing your cats, you should use Neem Soap as it is also a natural soap that has anti-bacterial, anti-fungal and insect repellant properties as well. You can buy Neem Soap from the PetWellbeing.com company as well. It also smells really nice!|`|AA11644298	i believe you're supposed to wait at least 24 hours to bathe them.  what will help you get the fleas out of their hair after you bathe them is to buy a lice comb.  they're a life saver.|`|qsjGiaW2aa	Wait up until a week and if they still have fleas i would get them flea collars. also when giving them a bath, use a shampoo that kills fleas.|`|jvHIqtp2aa	Actually you are supposed to wait 48 hours to bath them for best results. There is also a pill called cap star, you can give each cat one of them and it will immediately kill all the fleas on them, the advantage will help take care of any others that jump on them. You may want to consider spraying your carpeting and stuff if they came home with fleas that bad.|`|e54TCBKiaa	I think it takes about 12 hours to kill 95? 98? i forget how many % but almost all of them.  So i'm guessing ne time after 12 hours should be fine, since it has done most of its work already.  The rest should be dead later.    oh n idk how front line is applied, but if its a line along the back like the cheaper ones are, make sure your cats dont clean themselves, and even if its just the spot between the shoulder blades make sure ur cats don't clean each other.  I have 3 cats and after applying behind the hshoulder blades, i have to watch them, cu zthey are close to each other and end up cleaning each other from time to time.    well hope ur flea problem gets fixed soon.|`|4hNRTWtDaa	Depending on how long the fleas have been in your house, you may need to treat your house too.  When you have a flea problem, most of the fleas you have are fleas you don't even see, in the form of eggs and pupae in your carpet.  If you got the Advantage on quickly enough, you may do alright with just a couple of monthly applications of that.  Generally, you don't want to bathe them within 48 hours of applying    Good luck!    Oh, and I think whoever watched your cats should pay for your flea cleanup. ;)|`|Spycl8Ikaa	You should take them to the vet. Cuz we've had cats with extreme cases of fleas so we get them this pill. The fleas fall off after about 10 mins then you can bathe them. its really groos.

wF52XMxAaa	Almost any parrot can thrive on 3 hours of play time per day.  Pionus are a good beginner bird, and they're quiet - but they're not cuddly.  see http://www.avianweb.com/pionus.htm  You can scratch them, but probably not snuggle.    If noise is your number one concern, there are two types of small, quiet and cuddly parrots (I know small wasn't a criterion - they just both happen to be small) you might consider:  Lineolated parakeets (see http://www.parrotchronicles.com/mayjune2... ) are also a good beginner's bird.  Parrotlets (see http://www.parrotparrot.com/articles/aa0... ), are a little trickier to socialize, but still excellent pets.    If you're willing to put up with a little more noise in exchange for a somewhat larger bird, you might also consider:  Cockatiels (see http://www.birdsnways.com/wisdom/ww21eii... ) are the classic beginner's bird, but they have dusty feathers and are bad for people with asthma.  One of the poicephalus (e.g., Senegal, Meyers, Jardines): see http://proaviculture.com/poicephalus.htm  They each have somewhat different personalities, but all are quiet and affectionate.    Any of the above (including the pionus) make excellent pets.|`|Mg8zk1n7aa	If you want a more quiet bird then looking at the Pionus is a good choice. They aren't known for being cuddly, though. They are quite shy at first, but will eventually accept scratches mostly around their face (every bird is different, this is just generally). I am a big advocate of not having just one bird, but it sounds like you're doing a lot of research so you'll make up your mind on that.    And on that topic, good for you! You're clearly putting in the time to make sure you are picking the right bird and are going into it prepared. I think no matter which of those three birds you go with, you'll be fine.     I've never owned a Cockatiel, but I hear from friends that they are quite docile and calm...Budgies are more high-energy (and like other birds, enjoy company of their own species). The Pionus is definitely going to be more expensive than a Cockatiel or Budgie. Out of those three, Budgies are probably the loudest.    Anyway, hope that helped. Feel free to email me if you have any other questions, I'm no expert but I'll do my best =). Good luck with your choice.|`|oqsFbrLgaa	pionus are fantastic beginner birds. they are fairly quiet not very cuddly. then again every bird is an individual.    cockatiels are loving cuddly and they can be quiet. they come in alot og different colors.    if you expand into the amazona group. red lored amazons are fairly quiet and shy at first. they are more cuddly than other amazons and pionus.     of the poi's the meyers parrot are the most cuddly
8i90ov0Gaa	According to Kathy Love, baby corns can be fed on a schedule of once every three to ten days. The metabolism of a baby corn is high enough that it shouldn't be a problem, nor should it be considered powerfeeding. As long as the lump is gone by the next day, it should be fine. As it gets older, it should be fed at a less frequent rate. Unlike growing corns, adults are capable of becoming obese.|`|Jguzosm2aa	You certainly can. (:|`|MX9M36B4aa	As long as your snake will eat it and is voiding as much as you are feeding him then it should be fine,but just to let you know honey i own one and i feed to mice every other week,and mine is in perfect health and i have had for five years.Yours truly the lizard lady|`|e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	be sure there is no visible lump and its going poop regularly, then yes as a small baby they need to eat as much as they can!|`|k2l20XdFaa	Yes you can. As long you have a "hot spot" in the cage that the snake can use as it wants too. The ideal body temperature for digestion is 90 degrees F (32C). If the snake has the ability to reach that temperature, it can completely digest food in two or three days. Hope this helps.

z5GwTXx6aa	At least one acre per horse**|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Have you planned for a building to house essentials?  Hay and grain have to be stored indoors to prevent mold.  A shelter for your horse is important, and it isn't the best idea for him to be kept alone.  With a plot as small as you are considering, there isn't much room for a building.  You'll need room for equipment to maintain the paddock, since the manure will pile up fast and need to be removed, or it can overtake the entire area in no time.  You will need a place to take the manure after it is picked up.  Electric is nice to allow for a fan in summer or a heated water bucket in winter.  If the property is not well drained, it can turn to mud rapidly if it rains heavily, and there should be someplace to get your horse off of the pasture.  An area to ride is also desirable, unless you can just trail ride on surrounding properties.  I doubt there will be even light grazing for long on such a small piece of land, since even if you keep up with the manure, it will be overgrazed.  Two acres would be a more realistic and managable size to accommodate a building for storage and shelter, and paddock rotation so it doesn't become a dirt and mud paddock.  You must not live in the US?  A minimum of one acre per horse is pretty standard law around here.|`|RPTwjyjIaa	Cherry Hill had a great layout plan for one horse on 1/2 acre. She had one 70 x 80 paddock, one 20 x 70 pen, and one 15 x 50 foot pen sacrifice pen. She also has a layout plan for 1 acre, 2 acres, 5 acres, and 10 acres all in her book "horsekeeping on a small acreage". It is a great book and I highly recommend it. Have fun with your horse. :)|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	Ordinary pasture, not lush or irrigated, minimum requirements to maintain a horse is 2 acres per horse. If you have 10 horses, you need a minimum of 20 acres.  A horse on pasture alone with grain will eat down 2 acres easily. Remember they will not eat where they poop or urinate, so that takes care of half the pasture right there. If you are feeding hay with or without grain, 1/2 an acre will do.  ~*~*~* Lots of thumbs down on this one, apparently none of us know what we are talking about,, we all said about the same thing  lol.  Oh well..try and help   :-(|`|Qj9pPMf5aa	At least one acre a horse. But horses are herd animals and your horse might get lonley by him/her self... hope that helps though! =D|`|OjeL1if4aa	You can figure 2 larger animals per acre... meaning one horse needs half and acre. In that figuring you need to plan on feeding hay in winter months and possibly year round, depending on the quality of grass. Plus any other suplements/minerals that the horse won't be getting.    Personally, I think you're best off getting a full acre and dividing it in half. Rotate the pasture and keep it drug and irrigated properly and you shouldn't have any problems. By rotate I mean, keep your horse in one section until the grass is eaten down, then move him over to the other. You can probably figure 2-4 weeks on one section before it gets to the point where he needs to be moved. You don't want to let him eat it down too far or he'll pull up the roots so the grass won't grow very well.    If you want to go with the 3/4 acre you can section of the 1/2 acre and then keep the 1/4 acre for working him in... that way you aren't tearing up your pasture by working him.    The size also depends on if you plan to build him a shelter/barn with a paddock and just use the pasture part for turnout... It's up to you in the end... these are just some things to consider.|`|GsnchSsmaa	legally you need one acre per horse and in some states you need two. If youve seen barns with multiple horses in a small paddock its because after a certain amount of horses the acreage doesn't matter. But if you only have a few you will need an acre or two for each horse.|`|C3btl9dTaa	ok..your asking us not to tell you that a horse needs more than an acre but a horse does need an acre. just because you see 2-3 horses on an acre does not make it correct. It is not just making the horse uncomfortable. study up on the worms found in horses. if you knew about tapeworm, bots, roundworm etc. then you would realise that they travel from the ground, into the mouth and out through manure. on less than an acre. most of the time horses will eat their own manure because of the crowded space. therefor munching up those deadly worms!|`|AQaz64Cpaa	Well.... one of my friends boards her horse with 5 other horses on 144 acres of land. They have hay on demand.    Another one of my friends has her horse at a barn where she gets about a 20x40 foot paddock for half the day and a stall for the other half.    The less room it has, the more man/made exercise it needs. Expect it to eat roughly 100 70lb bales of hay a year. A horse needs about 2% of body weight in feed a day. It's got a looooooonnnnnggggggg digestive track and needs alot of roughage moving through it.|`|AA12148050	I thought the same thing to. A horse needs at least 1 acre UNLESS you plan to supplement his diet with hay and feed. In that case a 1/2 or less acre would be fine. Also the area you live in matters too. If you live in a warm climate 1 acre MIGHT sustain him all year long but if you live in a climate where is snows and frosts the vegetation will die and you will have to buy hay. Still it is much cheaper than boarding thats for sure.|`|hMXHsAbHaa	I think this is a bad idea...Firstly you have to pay for the land, then pay taxes on it every year, fencing, shelters/windbreaks, watering system, waste removal and feed and feed storage. Feed has to stay dry as we all know moldy musty hay isn't good for horses. Then hundreds of other little fees it takes to keep it running and for one horse that isn't very practical.    Another reason is that horses need company, whether it is another horse, cow or goat, horses simply aren't happy by themselves and probably won't work to their greatest potential and may become stressed or depressed. Expessially if he is used to having other horses nearby.     Thirdly i wouldn't recommend less then an acre per horse and would go with 1 and 1/2 to 2, expessially if you have a lot of wet weather. He may be getting fed extra but his feet will turn the place to muck and increase his chances of injury or feet problems. Most people rotate their animals and so can put more then one horse in a pasture and will move them when the pasture needs a break.
fa27c3346599fbfc609df0721c669bd4aa	Is the horse broke to ride? I would work on sacking him out, touching him all over and getting him desensitized.  I would teach him bending on the ground and teach him to move away from you when you ask.  Lunging is a great tool as well; teach him to walk/trot/canter & reverse on commad.  Teach him that clucking means trot and kissing noises means canter.  Honestly your best bet is to have a lesson once a week to discover new ways to train your horse and how to do it right.  I have a 3 year old I am training and I just started taking lessons on how to do proper groundwork and one day has made a world of difference.  But if you do use a trainer, make sure they are good trainers that have lots of patience.  Good luck.|`|Qj9pPMf5aa	ummm- well it depends what you want to train him to do- just the basics, what type of riding???

ty9HWYXpaa	Forget the 1 inch rule. Body mass and the amount of food you anticipate feeding is more important. The best advice I can give you is consider reading more about caring for a salt water aquarium/ecosystem.  Beyond that, don't introduce more than 1 or 2 individuals at a time until your system can respond to the new inhabitants.  Good luck!|`|OhYVBydEaa	The last post is correct... the one inch rule isn't really a definite thing..it depends on the fish. For example.. i have a 55gal and have Oscars and they grow pretty big, up to like 8"+ in my tank.. and i def wouldnt have six of them in there. Go more by type/body mass/activity habits.
ztMeGHY0aa	I have a cat that did this. He is neutered so it doesn't make any difference. I put him down on the floor if he started to hump so I think he has learned not to do it now or he looses out. He just sits cuddling now. The needing with his paws is left over from being a kitten as you are still providing his food like a mother would. I think as soon as your cat starts humping just put him down and hopefully he will stop doing it.|`|Wn4tjazIaa	Is he neutered? Might try doing that first.|`|4E296nSkaa	Maybe he is in heat? Is he neutered? or maybe he is just proving dominance.|`|QC94IKIxaa	He needs......erm.....you know!!!! If he's not been chopped, it may be too late and you will just have to put up with it.

This may seem harsh but if he's a typical Tom, it won't harm him and he will get the message!|`|1CvrXvjoaa	I had a Siamese cat that did the same thing. he would hum everything that would smell like me. drove me nuts. he is wanting to mate. as soon as you get him fixed he will stop.  hope this helps  good luck|`|xm0xo4cjaa	Well there can be a few reasons for this reaction.   1. Have you become fluffy lately?  2. Have you said meow to the cat? (everyone know that meow means "lets get it on")  3. Do you have a tail?    It may be your fault that your cat is attracted to you.|`|SgAYfsaRaa	it a man they are all the same
dYSysAfGaa	i think it depends on how long. cats have good senses and so even if they forgot u they would eventually sense you. its hard to explaing. but if its years than i dont think he will rememeber you honestly. i guess it depends on the cat.|`|0X4UXIBvaa	That depends on how close you are to the kitty. If you are rally close he might remember you. But if you are not that close then he probally won't.|`|4E296nSkaa	To be honest i dout it. I would give a 1 year remebery TOPS. Probley less than that. sorry :(|`|AA10953999	I think so, it may not remember you completely but it will most likely know you will not harm it.|`|4aAhEK9daa	I would be VERY wary of someone wanting a cat that looks like a clone of the cat they lost.  That's just creepy.  That's not someone looking to love a pet that's someone that's looking to pretend this pet is their lost pet.  And the second this cat doesn't act EXACTLY like their cat is when they'll decide to just dump the cat outdoors, at a shelter - wherever.  If you haven't already given this cat to them - which I hope you at LEAST altered before doing so? then DON'T.  And if you did - expect to hear from them soon that it's "not working out".    And it depends how clsoe you were to this kitten.  Did it live outside like its mother or was it around you?  If it's the prior then no, it probably won't remember you at all.
GHpcc5iKaa	Read the instructions on how to set it up. then leave it running for at least 24 hours. then once you are ready to move in your fish put them in a plastic bag and leave the floating in the top for about 20 minutes so they can adjust to the temp.|`|Nzb5QmNXaa	First, cycle your tank: http://tetra-fish.com/forums/showthread....    Second, when you move your fish, make sure to acclimate them.|`|ty9HWYXpaa	First read Hal P's comments and check out the excellent link. Second be sure to heed the advice. Third, remember and believe, the more fish mass (weight) that you plan to move the more important it is to read items 1 and 2 above.  If your situation allows and necessitates, move a few fish at a time.  Good luck!
AQaz64Cpaa	Anything certified and brand spanking new.    Replace it after every bad fall that you've hit your head. Don't leave it out in the sun, or in alot of heat. If you ride every day but don't fall off, replace it after 18 months or so.    Get somebody to help you fit it. It shouldn't give you a headache, but if it is all the way down on your head and you lightly wiggle it up and down with your hand, it should move your forehead skin. Some helmets are made more round, some more oval for different peoples noggins, so try a few on.    And everyone will die if they hit their temple once. Which is on their head. The biggest problem with riding is broken collarbones from curling and landing on your shoulder, and neck injuries from raising your head to keep it off the ground then having it snap back and hitting anyway.|`|Qj9pPMf5aa	i really like IRH, i fell off jumping a HUGE fence with it and i was okay- so my life is now entrusted in my IRH XR9!!! I love them and they are more comfy then the Charles Owens!

If you have a fall and bang your head - replace it. If you drop it on the floor - replace it. If your horse kicks it - replace it. Get a good protective bag for it.     I have a similar situation - I had a very bad head injury which if I hit the same place again...well not good. I always wear a hat, even if I am riding a bomb proof horse. I also wear it while tacking up and doing ground work.    Anyone reading this btw should follow this same advice. Some people get a warning they may die if something happens...some people just die the first time the something happens.|`|j5iTfhzAaa	I would try charles owens. They are excellent quality.

Rx7wv4JLaa	Here is an article on salmonella in dogs..please read it all it answers your question and gives more info that is important to know    Salmonella    Most people are somewhat familiar with Salmonella.  They know it represents a type of food poisoning, probably know it is associated with diarrhea that can be severe, and may even know that Salmonella species are bacteria.  Most human cases of Salmonella infection cause fever, diarrhea, and cramping that go away on their own, but in children it can produce more severe disease. As with Campylobacter, the young are more susceptible to more severe illness because they are smaller and do not have mature immunity.  The same is true with puppies and kittens; adult animals are almost never affected by Salmonella infection.    There is an important exception to the Salmonella is rare in adult dogs rule and that is the case of dogs fed a raw food diet.   It has, unfortunately, become popular to feed raw foods to pets with the idea that a raw food diet more closely approximates the natural diet that the feline or canine body evolved to consume, and thus such a diet should be healthier than commercially prepared foods. In fact, the cooking of food is central to removing parasites, bacteria, and bacterial toxins from food. A recent study evaluating raw food diets found that 80% of food samples contained Salmonella bacteria and that 30% of the dogs in the study were shedding Salmonella bacteria in their stool. Adult dogs are often asymptomatic but any infected animal or person will shed the organism for at least 6 weeks thus acting as a source of exposure to other animals or people. Salmonella organisms are very difficult to remove from the environment and easily survive 3 months in soil.  Again, dogs used for therapy around the elderly or children should be cultured for the presence of Salmonella.    There are two syndromes associated with Salmonella: diarrhea and sepsis. Salmonella bacteria, once consumed, attach to the intestine and secrete toxins. The toxins produce diarrhea that can be severe and even life-threatening in the young.  If this were not bad enough, some Salmonella can produce an even more serious part two.  These bacteria are capable of invading the rest of the body through the damaged intestine.    In young animals, the syndrome resulting is similar to that of canine parvovirus, thus similar treatment is expected.

Y8MZCLIQaa	Rottweilers are one of the best family dogs. They're very people orientated when brought up in a good family environment and most love kids.  Proper training is the key to a well temperamented dog. But other dogs also rub off on pups so your new pup will learn from the dog you already have. So if she's well behaved and good with your kids, the new pup will learn how to act from her. Also getting the kids to have an active role in the dogs lives will help a lot, make it the kids job to feed and wash the dogs. Then the dogs know the kids are above them in the hierarchy.   My friend had a rotti / doberman and he was the sweetest dog.. and he LOVED kids.. He was always getting out just to play with the kids down the street.  Good luck.|`|0iDmXV1gaa	no they are never mean unless raise to be that wa..as a matter of fact they are the biggest 150lb babies you could ever have.....|`|5BH8nTeRaa	Yes! i am 11 and i have 3 rotties, Roxy, Brandy and Special and they are great with me and my 8 year old sister!|`|3z3P6j49aa	They are not mean, unless you are trying to hurt their family!   And they are amazing with kids, i had two when i was born until i was about 10.  Unless you get one that was poorly bred, but in this case you know your friend probably treats the parents right, and you are getting it as a pup so you should be good!|`|okdPuy1Kaa	Yes, they are great if they grow up with kids. Make sure you expose your new pup to many different people and dogs (after all the vaccinations of course) and get him/her socialized well while s/he is young! Rotties can be very protective around strangers, so it's good to get them used to it early on.|`|omKbnOCVaa	They are GREAT family and kid dogs!    FACTS-    There has been so many reports on Rotties saving children's lives and saving there owners lives.     They are called the "Babysitters" They are a very popular dog with kids.    They are NOT mean if raised right. Don't blame the breed blame the deed!    You are very lucky! I really want to get my self a rottie! Once i have the time and my pups are older i will get one!|`|GlCZL753aa	We have a Rotty boy.  He loves kids and is great with little dogs too.  He is a great big black and mahogany wiggly clown.  But Rottys are stubborn and can be bullies, so you have to discipline them and make sure they know you are the boss.  Start training right away when they are puppies, and make sure you socialize them from an early age.  They make great pets.
cHiv6eTWaa	You have probably seen my posts as I am on your fan list. I try my best to educate people and give them the best cat advise I know of which is to feed premium high quality cat food I prefer holistic foods and to get pets neutered or spayed at or before the age of 6 months as it is better for their optimum health besides not bringing more unwanted kittens into the world.|`|4aAhEK9daa	You know, I would like to think that as well but one look at all the questions about pregnant cats and which Purina product is best makes me think that the good advice we hand out isn't exactly making much of a difference, I'm afraid.|`|ea207ed5b6ef75b8f1362932a6abf174aa	Nobody on here has ever convinced me to do anything.|`|9zOh1Nleaa	I have just started actually.

AA11443269	The crate will be her place and hers alone. Never use the kennel as a punishment tool! While driving in the car always put the dog in its crate if possible. They dont require a big cushy bed in the crate; its just that they have their blanket!     I used the crate as an end table leaving the door open. My dog used it whenever he wanted to lie down. It was his own personal place, he was out of the way and when he needed to be locked away it was there and ready. Each dog had its own and used its own.    When the dog walks into the crate to examine it say crate over and over. After coming out throw a treat in and say crate  crate. . Do this several times and even make a game out of it, dont just shove them in and think its going to help, all they will earn from that is to fear it. While you are sitting home one evening put the dog into the crate for a short amount of time then let her out and treat her. Later do it again! Each time you do it make the duration a bit longer.    Play it by ear, see how she responds, and be excited when she goes into the crate.    A dog is a den animal and as such hates to soil it's crate and will try very hard not to, so it is a good place to put the dog while away.    Let me know how things work, just a word of warning, you may find it difficult being that she isn't a puppy or has had  some bad prior  experiance, but on ther other hand she might already be trained.|`|AA11604264	Her crate should be a HAPPY and a SAFE place for her NOT punishment.  It's too bad you are adopting a mixed hound.  If you adopted a retired greyhound, he/she would already be crate trained.  You would just need to provide one for him/her to feel safe.  Google Greyhound Pets of America if you are interested in adopting a retired racer they can help you find an adoption group near you.|`|VwmaWcp9aa	For ideas on crate training, see the sites listed below.  We had our puppy sleep in his crate until he was about 4-5 months old.  He now usually sleeps on my daughter's bed and wakes her up if he needs to go out.  Both of our dogs' crates are open during the day so they can go in to play or rest.  We sometimes use it as a time out space when the puppy has done something bad (but only for a short while).  When we leave the house, both dogs go into their crates on command and receive a treat for doing so.|`|cwyMulZOaa	With my dog we trained her to sleep in her crate at night. When she was a puppy we locked her in but once she got used to it we left it open at night. She now loves it in there. Also to punish her we put her in and closed the door. So she associated a closed door with punishment and an open door with good.|`|ixXzqchGaa	Her crate should never be used as punishment.     as for the training.. not sure. I left my dog in a crate for a year while i went to work..but he sleeps on my bed then and now.. up to you. Just realize that once they are allowed on the bed. it is extremely difficult to train them to stay off the bed :P|`|sUik60LTaa	the crate is always a poitive place put the crate in your bedroom and take it in there at night and when youre not home or whenever. At first give a treet to go into the crate then eventually the dog will get the hint.  good luck  i love the crate and so does my dog|`|Bt3Hvh5Saa	have her sleep in the crate.. its great with potty traiing. when she is being bad-- put her in her crate and scold her|`|ltP1gO4taa	"Should she sleep in the crate, or should we take her bed out of her crate and bring it in our bedroom with us?"  I believe she should sleep in the cage for at least the first couple of weeks you have her.  This will help create a sense that the cage is a safe place for her.        "At what times do we tell her to go in her crate?"  Personally, I think that a dog should only be caged while you are gone, or asleep.  This is the way I handled my dog (She sleeps in bed with me now), but she ends up spending a lot of time in the cage on her own with the door open.      "Should we banish her to her crate when she is bad, or should it be viewed as a positive place?"  Never ever ever associate the cage with punishment.  First off, dogs don't understand a timeout.  You can't expect a dog to understand that she's in the cage as punishment for something she did 20 minutes ago.  The cage should be a place where only good stuff happens.    Ways to make the cage a positive place:  Randomly leave treats in the cage.  Introduce new toys by leaving them in the cage when your dog isn't looking.  Have play sessions with your dog in an opened cage and you sitting in front of it.    BTW...I really don't like the word crate.  I think some people use it to make themselves feel better about doing the wrong thing.  I know a trainer that recommends you "crate" your dog for 23 hours a day for the first 4-6 weeks you have them.  I think that is just plain cruel.      It's a lot easier to think of crating one's dog for 12 hours at a time than it is to think of CAGING a dog for extended periods.|`|11aoH0O5aa	Never use the crate as a bad tool . It should always resemble Good . Yes she can sleep in her crate .  You can put her crate in your room and that way she will still be close to you .     When your not home , Yes make sure she is in her crate . At least until you feel you can trust her to be out and about threw your house !|`|p1DXTSqOaa	You should probably take her to bed and when you leave the house you could put her in her crate and give her a bone. You should have her crate viewed as a positive place so she won't be afraid to go there if she is scared or needs time alone. If your home you could leave her out unless you are busy. When she is bad I wouldn't banish her to her crate though. That will probably scare her and then it would be a negative place rather than a positive one. At night when you take her to bed you could give her a bone. We have 3 labs and that'ss what we do with all of them.|`|8lisi6RFaa	If your want to Crate train your dog the best way to do it is by having her in there a little at a time and then gradually working up to longer times that shes in there. if she sleeps with you then let her sleep out of the crate however if she doesnt then have her sleep where you want her to. if your using her crate as her bed NEVER put her in the crate when shes bad it will only confuse her instead find i different place to put her say the laundry room for example.
8NSh1D4Maa	Keep her as quiet as possible until you get ahold of the vet.  I'd probably crate her so she can't move around and make the injury worse.  If you haven't heard back from your vet in the next hour or so, I'd try another vet.  I would bet they would see her just to get her out of pain for tonight if your vet is not able to be reached.  My puppy fell off a sofa last year and broke his leg, my vet had had an emergency and couldn't take emergency calls that night, so we ended up at another practice.  They took X-rays and sent home some painkillers to get him feeling better until I could get to my regular vet the next morning.|`|76nTvO4iaa	I hope your dog is OK.    I think you need to start looking for another vet.    My vet (there are 3 doctors there) has an answering service that answers the phone when they're closed.  If you have an emergency you call and leave a message.  The vet on call calls you back within 5 minutes to see if the dog needs to be seen that night or if it can wait until the morning.  Everytime I've ever called, we've ended up at the vet's office.|`|T8OFsBUUaa	Well, make sure she isn't bleeding internally, so watch for swelling in the areas she is hurt.    Make her comfortable and take your dog to the vet first thing in the morning. If it's a break, keeping it still is the best thing for it. But if she is trying to walk I am guessing it might only be sprained.    Good luck!|`|zWBYxMvWaa	Carry her and and rub all of her paws and legs one at a time.    Check for any rough spots, scratches, sharp points or anything that can be considered a fracture.  Check for any swelling which could be internal bleeding  If he cries excessively when you touch an area something could be wrong as well.      I wouldn't worry to much, he didn't seem to fall to far and she was probably just spooked.  Comfort her and give her a treat to get he mind off the stress.|`|okdPuy1Kaa	Just walk into the office!     I don't get it, why is your vet stupid? Maybe they are at lunch, or maybe they are closed.....|`|AA11887983	Ok, seriously, you expect your vet to be at their clinic 24/7?  And you call them stupid?  I sure as hell wouldn't want to go out of my way to help you with that kind of attitude.      Find an emergency vet clinic in your area.  There is probably one within an hour's drive of you, unless you are really in the sticks.     As for treatment, confine your puppy to a kennel, to keep it rested.  DO NOT give any medication to the pup.  And then take to the vet in the morning.  If the dog is able to walk on the limb, and is not constantly crying, it will probably survive the night.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	See if your dog will let you feel on the leg.  If you can feel that nothing is broken, but it is still tender, it may be a sprain or pulled muscle.  If you think it's broken then you need to try and stabalize it in a natural position.  Get two magazines, roll them up and flatten them out (long and about 2 inches wide), place one on either side of the leg and wrap it with gauze or an ace bandage to keep it stiff.  Your dog should be able to walk a little easier then.  If you think it's NOT broken then apply an ice pack for about 10 minutes every hour to keep swelling down.    If your vet is closed you need to call an emergency vet  .  If that doesn't work then you'll have to wait til morning.|`|SYrJiDKwaa	Just make sure the pup's comfortable.  There's really no way you can aces the damage.  Make sure he has plenty of fluids, and if possible, keep him in one spot.  Good Luck.

cqEYllm9aa	you should try to give it bowls of water or food. if he worsens then you should call animal control for help
uBFhKXgHaa	Why would you feed your cat Purina /anything/? Purina is a low quality cat food. I'd switch to a higher quality cat food.    You don't need a urinary tract formula, you need a wet/canned food. Vets get precious little nutritional training during their veterinary schooling, so they know next to nothing about pet nutrition. The only thing your vet is right about is switching gradually. Yes, foods should be switched gradually over the period of about a week or so.    Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Whiskas, Fancy Feast, Friskies, Meow Mix.    Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Felidae, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timber Wolf Organics.      Contrary to popular belief, wet/canned food is healthier for cats than dry. The reason is, in the wild, cats normally get most of their water content directly from their prey items and drink very little. Domestic cats are no different, and because of the fact that they are designed to take in water with their meal, they have a very low thirst drive. Cats often just don't drink enough. This leads to urinary tract infections and crystals. The bit about dry food being better for teeth is a myth and has not been proven in the least (cats barely even chew their dry food and, really, does a pretzel clean /your/ teeth? Cats should have their teeth brushed with cat toothbrushes and cat toothpaste at least a few times a week as well as see the vet for dental cleanings when necessary /regardless/ of what they are being fed). Canned/wet food is better because it more closely mimics the cat's natural diet. More on why canned food is best:  http://www.catinfo.org/  (Excellent cat nutrition information by a vet)  http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canne... (Canned Cat Food: Can Your Cat Afford to Live Without it?)  http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac... (Why Cats Need Canned Food)  http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp... (The Dry Food Crisis)  http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht... (Max's House: Feline Nutrition)    Another option to get cats to drink more would be a cat fountain. Cats tend to like to drink from running water and cat fountains see to that need, encouraging cats to take in more water.      Darksong~|`|K0uTjeWiaa	Actually, besides always switching slowly, your vet knows nothing about feline nutrition. Read the ingredients learn and feed proper food for the species        Nutrition since there are so many bad things out there is very important to your cats health  Contrary to what you may have heard; dry foods are not a great thing to feed a cat.   Please read the label on what you are feeding? What are the ingredients? Do you know what they mean? Is the first ingrediant a muscle meat like chicken or meal or other things?  http://www.catinfo.org/ Learn_How_To_Rea...  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...  Dry foods are the number 1 cause of diabetes in cats as well as being a huge contributing factor to kidney disease, obesity, crystals, u.t.is and a host of other problems. Food allergies are very common when feeding dry foods. Rashes, scabs behind the tail and on the chin are all symptoms  The problems associated with Dry food is that they are loaded with grains and carbohydrates which many cats (carnivores) cannot process.  Also, Most of the moisture a cat needs is suppose to be in the food but in  Dry, 95% of it is zapped out of dry foods in the processing. Another thing, most use horrible ingredients and don't use a muscle meat as the primary ingredient and use vegetable based protein versus animal. Not good for an animal that has to eat meat to survive.  http://www.catinfo.org/ My_Cat_is_Doing_...  You want to pick a canned food w/o gravy (gravy=carbs) that uses a muscle meat as the first ingredient and doesn't have corn at least in the first 3 ingredients if at all.      THE  BEST CAT FOODS CONTAIN NO GRAINS NO BYPOODUCTS NO MEAL  Cats are meat eaters not cereal or rice eaters   Fancy feast is a middle grade food with 9lives, friskies  whiskas lower grade canned and wellness and merrick upper grade human quality foods. I would rather feed a middle grade canned food then the top of the line dry food.   Also, dry food is not proven to be better for teeth. Does a hard pretzel clean your teeth or do pieces of it get stuck? http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp...     Please read about cat nutrition.   http://www.catinfo.org/                                   http://www.catinfo.org/feline_obesity.ht...        http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht...     Vetinarian diets  The reason your vet thinks so highly of the pet food they sell probably has more to do with money than nutrition. In vet school, the only classes offered on nutrition usually last a few weeks, and are taught by representatives from the pet food companies. Vet students may also receive free food for their own dogs and cats at home. They could get an Iams notebook, a Purina purse and some free pizza.  http://iml.jou.ufl.edu/projects/Spring04...|`|FhVobWpeaa	could be its the antibiotic that is making your cat sick and not the food.  ask your vet if this particular antibiotic can have side effects that match your cats present symptoms.    EDIT  It usually takes 2 or 3 days or more before antibiotics will make an animal or a human for that matter sick it really sounds to me as if yopur cat could be reacting to them. this happens frequently,|`|VA1epT8waa	When I adopted my cat he was eating Nine Lives food, and i was told that if I was going to change his food to do it gradually. I switched my cat to Science Diet, By mixing a little of the Science Diet with the Nine Lives and gradually adding more every week, until he was only eating the Science diet. Cats ussually can't handle changing foods too fast and its not good for their stomach what so ever and that vet sounds like an idiot, and he probably should have known that cats have very tender stomachs.

Ok I can see if the dog needs help walking if the dog has some type of medical problem, like my dog a few years back got bit by a spider his leg swelled up 3 times the size, long story but i had to use a bath towel to get him up so yes I could see something like that helping, but just to be carried like some purse, O my this is why God gave dogs legs to walk on them it dose look like baggage.|`|wSc7ZdBCaa	Hi C.A. ~    I can understand why you've received so many responses to the photos.  If this is advertised in one of those "boutique" for dogs type of magazine or website then most of us would think it's a very tasteless bad joke. It is quite entertaining to watch the "stars" and (in)famous people dress their pets. The bulldog dressed as the maid of honor. The chi's (among others), that are forced into clothes, furs and jewels they would never be caught dead in. You can tell my the animals expression they are just too embarrassed to even look at themselves in a mirror!   ;)      But, on a serious note: It's been a long time since I've been involved in the dog world so I don't get to many shows, receive catalogs or dog magazines anymore. That means I am not sure about the availability or sources for the following item. A dog sling for want of a better word.    There are certain conditions where the use of this TYPE of equipment is necessary and a blessing. It is for the dogs that have been crippled in some way or lost one or more legs.   They're not quite so "stylish"...most were made of a type of heavy-duty canvas that is washable and the air can get through so the dog doesn't overheat.  They come in different sizes. When someone has a larger dog or the person is elderly or physically weak, having one of these slings makes it possible for the owner and animal to have a much easier time getting outside, into cars and to vet appointments, etc.    Re: other question I didn't have a change to answer before. A doctor from Switzerland, Elizabeth Kubler-Ross wrote a book called   "On Death and Dying". It gives a description of the grief cycle. You may find that you and your husband can benefit from reading this book together and individually. Please believe me I know, first hand, what you both are going through. You and your family are in our prayers.|`|4Sf8hgy3aa	Dogs are not meant to be a fashion statement or accessory, this kind of stuff makes me sick. How could that possibly be comfortable or safe?! And how indignified is that dog right now? I know animals aren't capable of THE most abstract thought, but I know he/she is not lovin life in that thing.|`|11aoH0O5aa	Wow what will they think of next ? Some people .  Im pretty sure some dumb famous person like : Paris Hilton would but that crap .  But hey idiots think alike . lol|`|yVUG0PKPaa	some like it some don't|`|49IbcrLaaa	hahaha I think this is terrible. but funny. That dog doesn't look very comfortable.|`|2b55447986fa477b09be856c2ee08f7faa	that is so stupid, i really hope people dont buy that, and if they do well then they are stupid too!|`|todbELE5aa	Oh YA
TnY8goobaa	Um.. to tell you the truth i think that it is just a lighter stop of hair on your horse.. it could be from if its dam or sire is a lighter colour. Yes, you would have to make down all of his markings.. .it may take a while but you still have to do it|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	It is small, it looks like just a white spot on the cannon bone. All the markings need noted, usually in red, or at least outlined in red.|`|yghLaVQKaa	paint horses dont have markings. all the markings on them are just a part of their coat pattern for example, this horse doesnt have a star, its just a part of her pattern    http://www.saudeanimal.com.br/imagens/pa...
z5GwTXx6aa	I love Siamese.  They are very vocal and have good personalities.  Just make sure they get along with your other cat first.**|`|iYzmnIsJaa	2 cats are better than one, however if the sweet cat you have now, is a medium length or long-haired cat be warned of this generality that proved true in my house:  Siamese cats are very smart and they pick on more docile breeds.  I didn't know this until after I got my first Siamese and saw it in a book.  My female was an elderly cat, so that played into.  My kitten would come in and knock her off the bed if she was next to me.  Would he lay down next to me afterwards?  No.  He'd run off to play.  He just didn't like her having my company!  He was also very playful and would try to force her to play.  I ended up getting a second male siamese kitten so the old cat could have some peace and that worked.    I love Siamese cats, but unless your sweet female is very spunky and on the young side, you might want to get her a tabby male or male of similar breed to the one you have.  If she's Siamese, a male that's a little younger than her and on the gentle side!  Petfinder.com has many Siamese  and other breeds to check out.    PS:  Read articles on how to introduce the new cat to the house.  You usually have to give the "established" cat extra attention and affection, because they can get very upset about sharing their human with an infiltrator.  Also you want to make sure the new cat is healthy and doesn't give your original one an illness.    http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...|`|kXZtPZFjaa	Go with 1 male and 1 female 2 females could cause behavior issues.|`|kwBbKXmqaa	I have two cats and yes two are better than one. They get lonely unless they have a playmate. My male is 18 months older than my female.|`|oytsL4EZaa	cats are always better in pairs.  you will probably find that after getting a second cat they will be more affectionate w/ you.  siamese cats are beautiful and typically have great personalities.  just make sure that you take some precautions when introducing the second cat into your home.
280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	I think that if she has confidence issues still, you might want to leave it up for a little while longer. If you think she can adapt, just transition her slowly. I assume there's some sort of cushion, blanket or bed in the crate? You can remove the crate and keep the blanket or bed in the same spot and see how she reacts, this would be much less traumatic than removing the whole set-up altogether.|`|Fvuq2Nwiaa	Personally because she does sometimes use the crate to nap I would leave it for now. Dogs are den animals and she may find comfort in her comfortable little den when you are out of the house.   :-)
qqUvoC5uaa	Try walking her either more often, farther, or at a quicker pace.|`|qPIsxtPDaa	there's not much u can do..but BE SURE when u go 2 the vet u know 2 ask!:) a possibilty that wass my dogs prob is that..she is eating during the night or EARLY morning as in (2 am and stuff)  so she eats and it builds up into lots of fat. Check on that .. im not sure whatelse. ;) good luck!|`|C2bXIhlUaa	It could be her thyroid you will need to have this checked and the vet can give you medication for it if that is the problem. If that isn't it she may just need more exercise.|`|cwyMulZOaa	This same thing happened to my dog. Feed her a little less every day. And walk two times a day even if they are short walks. Encourage her by running a lot with her too|`|UWDisHVHaa	I had a 16 lb miniature pinscher that was a rescue. I got him down to 9 lbs on Eukanuba weight loss food.  No extra exercise, just diet.    You're doing all the right stuff.   Cut back on the food more.     If a dog (or a person) is overweight, they are taking in more calories than they are burning.  Cutting the food is FAR more effective that more exercise.  You have to jog for 30 minutes to work off a kids meal from McDonalds.  Much less is required is you just stick to the healthy foods.  Same goes for your dog.
AA10859773	I don't know what you might have seen, but I have used the word "huffing" to describe that thing that cats do sometimes....it's like they've got something stuck in their throats and they might throw up.  It's sort of a cough.|`|SITgGHWaaa	Well, this is where I heard of it-    http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Kitte...|`|1GzmHZcfaa	Yeah, it's a joke. The idea is that there's supposed to be some way to "huff" kittens like huffing drugs--I'm not even sure the people who created the joke have really thought through how that would be done, which is probably why you can't find an explanation. :P    It's just a really bizarre joke.|`|85gJHDbNaa	Immediately, I think of that one episode of South Park where Stan's dad gets addicted to sniffing cat piss because it causes hallucinations of monster boobie filled worlds.    EDIT: From what the other poster said, I'm sure this is exactly what people are talking about.
Ws2QPD0Iaa	If you want to spoil your gerbil, getting a cage is not the option.  An aquarium is much more suitable because their tails and feet get caught in wire cages.  They also chew through metal bars.    Gerbils burrow so if they are in an aquarium it gives them the chance because you can add more bedding without getting it everywhere.    As for toys, don't get plastic.  They will eat it and it's not good for them to digest.  Wood, cardboard.. stuff to snack on.|`|8580a00b8928b21b7e2a1300aeb99f4faa	Contact Richard Gere|`|Ey1Mb4FAaa	kaitlyn.... is right if you what to spoil your gerbils you have to get a tank they are the best for gerbil and it not about what you want it about the needs of the gerbil. most wire cages are not good homes for gerbil they say gerbil because the company wish to make money and lots of people just do what big company says and don't research it themselves    http://www.erodent.co.uk/GerbilCages.htm  http://www.agsgerbils.org/Gerbil_Care_Ha...
ltP1gO4taa	American Cocker Spaniels have been notoriously over-bred.  They have a myriad of hip (Dysplasia), eye (Retinal atrophy, glaucoma, cataracts), and skin problems.  They are also prone to ear infections.    This breed was originally a hunting dog and has been inbred and line-bred to the point that they have lost any sporting ability they have and are only lap dogs now.  Virtually all American Cocker bloodlines suffer from a combination of these problems.    I'm not a huge fan of the limited gene pool that the AKC has set up here in the states.  If you are looking for a pure bred dog, I would look at European bloodlines.      Perhaps an English Cocker Spaniel?  They are prone to many of the same medical conditions, but to a much lesser extent.|`|oZoJ4YmZaa	my female is only days to giving birth and their great pets|`|HakDJjSuaa	i've got an american cocker, they are so cute and cuddly! my dog gets along with everybody and will play with anyone. they are so fun, you would not regret getting one. they arent the smartest dogs ever but they are a great dogs! :)|`|sNDQCpZsaa	Cocker Spaniels are very beautiful, but they sometimes have attitudes, and get spoiled easily. Otherwise, it would be a great playmate for your Mastiff, if you train it well!|`|xP8oJoxnaa	Well, I have a Cockapoo (Cocker Spaniel and Poodle)    I've had him for almost 8 years. He does not really get along with small dogs and he's afraid of  large dogs. He's very nice though. Cute and comforting. =)
z5GwTXx6aa	I love Wolves and would love to adopt some. However, they are still wild animals even adopting as a pup and can turn wild at any time.**|`|zguucR8yaa	Since you're asking this question on Yahoo, it is painfully obvious you are not qualified. If you were a caretaker, like you claim to be, you would already know the answer to your absurd question.|`|DUOoMBqoaa	Ever hear of a phone? Call the caretaker. Doesn't sound like you are qualified to take care of wild animals.|`|8IfePMa3aa	Wild animals are and always will be wild. They can seem okay for years, but that instinct is always there and it comes out sooner or later. It's highly reckless to place wild animals anywhere outside of the wild/designated care facilities.|`|YGwvoUPTaa	what the heck. that adoption site is for donations, not for you to take home baby wolves. adopting the wolf is like adopting a highway; you pay experts to take care of it.    nobody would ever adopt out a wild animal to a civilian, especially a dangerous predator like a wolf. it is obvious by your questions that you are no expert in wildlife. you can keep dreaming about running your animal circus but nobody would give you a wild animal to take care of. furthermore, no wild animal really needs to have an adoption service to keep animals alive unless they are vets or zoologists.     wild cats? do you mean strays that live in your alleys? uh stray cats will go home with anyone who gives them attention.     you sound like you're about to get a bad case of rabies real soon.|`|qqUvoC5uaa	As far as it shows on the website. It is for donating money to the adoption centre.   I doubt if they were any sort of reputable centre they would have a wildlife preserve for these animals, not be allowing them to go into homes that they would not be happy in.|`|W02kTOqmaa	You do realize that website doesnt "give you" a wolf, right? And there is not such thing as "a wildlife adoption center". You make a contibution that goes towards the survival of wild wolves, and they send you a random picture of one and a stuffed toy.    You're an idiot, and I hope a lion eats your face off|`|xO15PzZzaa	leave the poor animal alone.|`|4Sf8hgy3aa	Since you had to ask, NO. It will not be alright with any of your pets if you don't have the experience to properly handle it. You have to monitor this animal constantly and work with it everyday if you want it to be in any way domesticated. I would leave this to the professionals. I've raised hybrids but I've never tried to raise a full-blown wolf.     It's cruel for the animal and dangerous for you and your pets.    ADD::  I don't know how you could possibly be as 'qualified' as you claim to be about wild animals, but still need to ask YA if they will be alright with domesticated animals. None of this makes any sense. It is CRUEL to remove any wild animal from its natural habitat, especially ones such as wolves and (if I interpreted correctly, big cats?) There are several species of big cats that are 3 breeding females away from extinction, in part becuase people think it would be fun to have one as a pet. They are not cute little kitties, they are machines. They are wild animals.     I can't believe anyone claiming to be an expert in wildlife would try to domesticate these creatures.|`|sA5smsSgaa	Wolves will be wolves. No matter what you do, they will still have a bigger instinct with dominance with your dogs, and most likely you as well. If you're going to have it since a pup, you might want to go and ask to interact with an adult before you adopt. This way, you will know the behaviour of an adult wolf.    However, as far as I know, you need a license to own these kind of animals. They belong to professionals, if not the wild. Unless there is no law, or you have a license, don't. In my opinion, I would say to let the professionals deal with them, I would understand the temptation to adopt one, but donating monthly is a good idea too.|`|opjYENGGaa	No wolf can be domesticated, even if you will have him when he's a puppy. They still have natural killer instincts; I wouldn't adopt a cat as well because wolves have a very high prey drive. I would be cautious, because a wolf is not like a normal domestic dog and most likely won't act like one.|`|FkY5P2Xqaa	i think you have too much money to know whats good for you or the wolf. personally i think you should use the money you were going to use to adopt it and give it to a zoo so they can take care of the wolf and let it be with other wolfs.|`|AA11443269	I can only tell you what I have heard; I have no experience with wolves.    Check out its relationship with dogs; I have never heard of a wolf and dogs together.     Get it very young, the younger the better for you, about 5 weeks    Check the local regulations and officials. I know of one person who had some and had to have a 10 foot fence, because of regulations.    Check with your insurance carrier, there will probably be a premium.    There is probably much more also|`|5kDQLFhraa	It's illegal to own a wolf. I think you should donate your money to help save the wolves. Don't use it to bring it out of its habitat.    Also the website has nothing to do with adopting a REAL animal. You buy plush animals and the money is used to help fund further work with that species as well as work on other imperiled wildlife and the habitat it needs to survive.      ALSO if you were a caretaker then you wouldn't have to post your question at Y!A. Why would your husband and you fly there with your helicopter if you work there?? I really don't understand where you are coming from with all of this.    ADD: I agree 100% with Buffy!!!!!|`|DvTeTKcLaa	Dogs more often than not display the same pack characteristics as wolves. Since your getting the wolf as a baby it will learn that you are the pack leader and the dogs there before it are members of the same pack. It's possible that you will have no problems at all.     However that's just my observation. I still recommend you ask the caretaker the same question as a wolf is a wild animal.
E3VJAXDZaa	This site has tons of great info to help you out    http://www.reptilesexotic.webs.com/|`|MX9M36B4aa	No what you are doing is fine.I have a set of beardie and i put my cricket in a bag and put the powder in and gently shake them until they look completly white.I call it shake-n-bake crix LOL:)Well i hope i helped.Yours truly the lizard lady|`|eS8wuYRfaa	All you really have to do is make sure all the crickets have a light coating on them.  Also make sure you "gut-load" the crickets before feeding them to your dragon.  That will ensure they are nutritious enough for feeding.|`|4CuxzUioaa	throw that stuff out all together and buy a gut load food for the crickets. it's much easier. no it should be fine though too much is not really all that posable with a cricket half of it comes of in the tank anyway|`|4zAdpQWSaa	It's probably not too much especially since depending on how long the crickets are running around after a lot can come off. However, you should be gut loading the crickets, and dusting them with powder only doing one generally isn't good enough.|`|owi3TGSBaa	YOU CAN GUT LOAD THE CRICKETS BY FEEDING THEM FRUITS OR VEGETABLES WITH THE CALCIUM POWDER DUSTED ON THEM AND FEEDING THEM TO THE LIZARD A DAY LATER IT IS A MUCH HEALTHIE WAY TO DO IT,

No more fish..shame    They may kill the guppies but won't try anything with the mollies or platies.|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	Tiger barbs grow to about 3 inches and should be kept in schools of 6. If they arent, they nip at other fish.    Your tank is way overstocked.|`|Nzb5QmNXaa	I would get a bigger tank. That will help with aggression. I would also get 3 or more tiger barbs for the schooling.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Your tank is overstocked.    Tiger barbs should not be kept in tanks any smaller than 20 gallons, and they are known fin nippers.    ~It's impossible to answer your question "will they survive", how can anyone say for sure? Not all fish are alike, and individual behavior cannot be predicted, only speculated. Your barbs are not in a school, and in a small tank- heightened aggression could very well be an issue for you.|`|fQ3d5iAWaa	First of all there is a need of getting a bigger tank, because in small tank fishes can start fighting over the territory and food.Get at least 20 gallon even bigger. Than it would be better if you do get three more Barbs, but i think that they should do fine as a pair. And as you know barbs are aggressive fishes and if you put them with a community fishes barbs will kill them.|`|qAzOuQNJaa	Her name is tiger wann more space    so give her space otherwise she will kill smaller once too.  wann more ..oxegen.  thanx
repO76qoaa	Sorry. I don't think they can admire like us.     Loyal dogs tend to watch their masters and are in waiting for the next command.|`|P4vRH5Ufaa	Sometime Dogs just stare.  When my corgi, Peaches stares at me it generally means she wants something, usually food, attention, to go outside, or to join me on the couch.  Depending on the personality of your dog it should be possible to determine if and what it wants.|`|omKbnOCVaa	Thats odd? Wild dogs and wolf packs when they challenge each other to a fight they will stare at each others eyes and then one makes a move and they fight. Its a challenging behavior.|`|SM7ZhMVhaa	The puppy also could be waiting for a command or some direction from you. If it is a breed that is eager to please, it will constantly be waiting for you to pay attention to it so that it can please you and then be rewarded...|`|4hNRTWtDaa	Puppies are curious about everything.  He's waiting to see what you'll do next, hoping it will be something enjoyable for him. :)  Like petting, or happy voices.|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	I think she's just looking at you, simple as that. You might have just moved in subtle way that caught her attention. Maybe you made a small sound. Maybe she's just observing your body language. Maybe she's just comfy sitting like that.
dTLxjGPyaa	He may even be moulting this is a depressing stage for hermit crabs and they bury in the sand whilst there new outer skin hardens. I would pull him out and check him. If he buries back in over night leave it a bit longer then do the same again.|`|uNQa4tXDaa	he might die i would check for him.|`|yGWQuL81aa	Some animals like to hide when they die. Just like Marley in the movie which I cried in. I think so, but if you took him to the vet, the vet guy would just stare at you like your a moron. It happened to me.

Be prepared if need be to take her and any pups she has whelped to the vet if a problem arises.     Take her into your regular vet tomorrow once all the pups are born to be examined along with your vet.    Do not leave her unattended.

Sometimes after the first pup is delivered, they are a little bewildered and don't know what has happened.  You may have to show her how to tear the sack off the puppy so it can breathe, but give her a chance to do it herself.  Let her lick and let instinct take her from there.  She'll lick and stimulate the pup to help it breathe.      If things look like they are not progressing in the birth, call a vet.  That reaching in and turning the babies and stuff is for professionals.    Good luck!  Congrats.

Get some scissors, rubbing alcohol, dental floss, rubber gloves and a nasal aspirator.  You'll need the scissors to cut the umbilical cord (about an inch away from the pup), the dental floss to tie around the end of the cord (closest to you, not the pup), rubbing alcohol to dip the tied off end in to sterilize, nasal aspirator (bulb) to suck the gunk from the pups nose, and rubber gloves to wear while doing it all and to assist momma dog if she has trouble delivering.  If she has all the pups with no problem, great! Take her and the pups to your vet in the morning for a check up.  If she goes more than 3 hours, without active labor, take her to the vet.  If she goes more than 1 hour, with active labor, take her to the vet.  If a placenta comes out but no pup is in it, take her to the vet.    Good luck|`|ltP1gO4taa	Don't panic!

'Tiels are flock animals as well as prey in the grasslands of Australia.  It's in their instincts to be overly cautious and timid with any kind of change or new object in their life.    I can't begin to list the number of average household objects that scared my 2 hand-raised 'tiels over the years.    here's more tips I've picked up:  ~ Is your bird's cage in a secure, safe feeling environment?    ~ Is there an overhead fan in the room?  Sometimes the shadows these fans cast can be perceived as large predatory birds by small pet birds.    ~ Is the room high traffic or low traffic?  I recommend keeping its cage and 'safe place' away from loud or noisy areas for a week or so, so that when you.    I've only covered a short range of potentially scary things your cockatiel may be facing in its new home.  If you'd like to ask me more questions, feel free to e-mail me!|`|qS4EG5qYaa	feed it treats and patt it and let it know that u r a friend|`|vbEkYH2haa	If its a baby, then your new cockatiel should bond to you fairly quickly.

Just spend as much time with him/her as you can and get to know its behavior and personality a little first, and then go from there.|`|K0H7bAR8aa	Give it time!!

OXNj34gzaa	I don't blame you for wanting a "fresh" puppy.   When I wanted a puppy, I did so much research on how to become a responsible owner.  I too, wanted a puppy that wasn't from a shelter or any pet adoption places.  Not to be mean, but I wanted a dog who didn't have a dark past and wasn't abused by anyone.  I wanted one from a breeder who took care of their dog's litter.   So I looked online and researched many reputable breeders.  I wen't to puppyfind.com and nextdaypets.com.  WARNING! THERE ARE MANY BYB OUT THERE, SO MAKE SURE THAT YOU ASK THE BREEDER MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DOG YOU WANT.  REPUTABLE BREEDERS ARE HONEST AND WILL BE GLAD TO ANSWER ALL YOUR QUESTIONS. :) Don't just email them, talk to them on the phone, or better yet, go to their houses.          Good luck! :)|`|76nTvO4iaa	Do not go to a pet shop or flea market to buy a pet.    Check:   http://www.petfinder.com//index.html    They do have puppies who have never been homed.|`|W0buucLsaa	Shelters have young puppies, too - usually PLENTY of them. A lot of irresponsible folks let their dogs get pregnant and then surrender them to the shelter once they figure it out, or bring in the litter when they can't find homes for the puppies.     But if you have to *sigh*, the only good way to get a dog BESIDES a rescue organization or shelter is to go to the OFFICIAL AKC breed website and look at their breeders. You won't be able to buy puppies through the websites, probably not even look at pictures; you'll have to get on a list for a litter that hasn't been weaned/born yet.    FYI: No dog has more love to give than one that's been abandoned before.|`|CtYqMs5Paa	there is nothing wrong with a shelter pet...Second hand pets still give first class love.

Shelter pets need love, which I think you can give them, there are too many homeless dogs already. The Amanda Foundation gives numbers for shelters for every breed possible. If you really want a new breeder, you can go to their website. If you want more info, go to www.momsk9kamp.net|`|AA10112346	A responsible breeder is one that knows what they are doing. A BYB is bad. They "breed" make puppy's with 2 different breeds. It is called a mutt. It is not a good mix. Go with pure breeds. [unless you adopt then get a mutt].     Go here and find a breed :http://www.akc.org/index.cfm?nav_area=ho...    and on that same page they have referrals of responsible breeders.    Good luck.

They often come in while their moms are still pregnant with them or they haven't been weaned yet and were on the street or dumped off by an idiot.    If you really want to buy a purebred registered dog (that's the only kind reputable breeders have) then you need at least $500 plus another $300 for shots/bedding/bowls/toys/leash/collar/fo...   Go online to akc.org and check out their breeder classifieds.  If that doesn't work then go to google.com and type in what breed you want and where you are located and it will find breeders in your area.  After that it's up to you to pick a good, reputable, purebred breeder.|`|126bfea064dab180f9dbd5f3906a914faa	If you want a specific breed of dog, visit a reputable breeder. You should be able to find some reputable breeders by contacting a local breed specific social or rescue group.    As far as going through rescues, you can get 8 week old puppies that have even been born when they were with the rescue group. I work with a rescue group in Oklahoma ad I actually just had a 12 week old puppy get adopted this weekend. He was in our group's care from before when he was born.    Good luck and do PLENTY of research!|`|vzGPL7lhaa	look for a breeeder or pet shop|`|hznP1mWNaa	shelters usually have puppies, if that's what you want, and they're a lot cheaper than a breeder, and if a purebred is what your looking for, 25% of all shelter dogs are purebreds. go check out a shelter nearby, see if they have puppies, and just give them a chance. they need a home more than a puppy from a breeder.

As for the tear stains on the eyes, they have something for it. Ask your vet for some tear stain remover names and where to get it.

hoeN5xP0aa	Supervise them. Don't leave them alone, Let him know everything is alright. Pitbulls are a territorial breed, they see it as their home, and the pup is an intruder. As I said, give it time, keep them seperated and gradually introduce them and SUPERVISE, never leave them alone if he is showing signs of agression towards her.|`|26PPwzrWaa	It may just be the dog working out boundaries. Most of the stuff we see is actually communication to avoid a real fight.

For now, all you can do is have closely monitored socialization 'sessions' with them in which you exercise/play/train both of them equally so the male doesn't feel jealous, and learns that the baby is now part of the family.   It's very difficult to introduce new dogs in a previously one-pit household, but it can be done. You need to be very patient and always cautious. I suggest crating the puppy or both of them when you are not home, and get the older dog into obedience class to make sure you have utmost control over him in a situation that looks like it could escalate.  Make sure they are both fixed of course, and socialize both of them often. Try one at a time at first, and then together. The main thing is to make them feel like 'family' so the aggression issues subside in the male.  Like I said, you will need to be very patient. There are plenty of books on pitbulls and bully breeds, and the best way to manage a multiple-bull household.  It won't be easy, but it can be done. Good luck.|`|NyNaJmIkaa	There's a good chance of him hurting the puppy, either now or when you least expect it. I take that back, let me reword it I meant to say there's a good chance of him killing the puppy.    But hey it might not happen, it's on you. Only you can know what your dog is capable of. We don't have enough details to really judge this one.    Edit: you added that you have socialized him with other dogs so that's a positive sign. Don't let him see you giving attention to the puppy if you can help it or he will be jealous which can cause him to snap.|`|ZPNHwLw3aa	Always show the first animal that was in the house equal respect. Yes, the newborn may be cute and it may receive more attention because its "new" but dogs arn't toys. They do have feelings. Think of the relationship as a balance beam, you kiis the puupy on the nose.. give the other dog a nice belly rub. Imagine you being the oldest sister and a newborn comes into the family, you wouldnt want to be just pushed aside you would want attention to, so love them equally.     Now for the aggression part, when barring lips thats not a good sign. The first dog may need space from the little one. Dont try to have the puppy in your arms and kneel down by the older dog and have them kiss eachother, it just wont work. Not only will you be dangering yourself, but the new puppy to. Give it time and let the new born mature then slowly begin to introduce them to eachother but in a respectful way. And dont forget the love for both of them!    =] good luck|`|11aoH0O5aa	You should slowly introduce the puppy to your older pit .  Every time he starts to lift his lip , you tell him NO firmly .     Try not to force the new puppy on him , it might take him a while to get use to her .  Also don't let the puppy invade his personal space . Let him come to her .     If all else fails then you can take them both to training classes together !|`|u12ZCegEaa	Hey Ryan...    I have a 4 month old puppy, and he is sooo sooo sweet but when my roommates boyfriend brings his dogs.. he goes nuts... nuts as in all excited and jumps around and all that stuff.    But the major problem is.... that he gets too aggressive and growls at the other dogs... the other dogs include a 2 year old pitbull, 6 year old german shepard, and a 6 month old rottweiler. I try and pull my dog away when he gets too hyper and aggressive, I distract him with LOTS of treats... his favorite treats though.     So I suggest that you do something that will distract him.. like when your other dog walks in the room, give the male dog a treat... then go pet the female dog.. and if the male gets mad... then pull him away and give him a treat... but make sure you make this a pattern otherwise it won't work. You don't want to confuse your dog by just ignoring him when he gets jealous towards the female dog.    Try it and let us know how it goes...  Good Luck    =]|`|AA11598954	Take Buffy`s advice as nothing can be said to improve upon it.I`ve introduced puppies to full grown APBT`s and never had a problem  as the pup posed no threat to them. However, a one year old is still  a pup in my book and can play too rough or possibly kill an eight week old  and then go about it`s business. Yes, never leave them alone, not even for a second.|`|xkekDxO7aa	Older dogs generally have a strong sense of tolerance when it comes to puppies. That is not to say that he won't hurt the puppy though. I would suggest that you watch them very closely and do not leave them alone together. He is probably just warning the puppy that he does not like what its doing. My brothers 13 yr old pit has always lifted her lip to his 1 1/2 yr ld. They are great together he just likes to annoy her alot. Someone said not to give the pup any attention in front of your dog, I wouldn't do that he needs to learn that its not acceptable. Be calm and assertive and when you see this aggression make a quick strong sound like "ah" to your older dog. If he is trained like you said it should get his attention. Anyways I would not make to big of a deal out of it but watch it. Also make sure you are not giving the pup more attention or any less to the older one. Good luck it will probably be fine.
6VFh61jhaa	Yes. I think that they are really good pets for first time bird owners. I have never owned a bird before, but I got a budgie Saturday, and I am reallly happy with it. You just have to make sure that you choose food that has enough nutrition in it. For example, I aked what they fed them at the store, and bought that and added my own touch to it.Something that they really like if you can find it in a local store is LM ANIMAL FARMS Fruit Harvest Wholesome parakeet snack. I bought a 354g bottle and mixed it kwith about a litre and a half of her regular food, and she loves it. But anywas=)    Mine doesn't make hardly any noise. After you put a b;anket or sheet over their cage, they normally go to sleep. If you only have one, then they make virtually no noise at all ever . They do chirp sometimes, but it isn't that loud.    Yes. Like I said before, I got one Saturday, and I wish that I had got one way sooner. They are so sweet.    No they don't come with thei r wings clipped, but I wouldn't recomend cliping them anyway. They're birds, which means that they are meant to fly. You don't really need to get them cliipped, because they aren't that hard to catch after you have trained them, or if you have a cage that the top comes off of. That what I have, and when she gets done  flying around, she goes right back in her cage.    Yes. They are extremly friendly to humans. They hardly ever bite, and if you only have one, it will bond to you, makeing the two of you inseperable.    When you first get it, it'll be scared of you. So, at the begining, it won't want to be stroked at all. You don't really  hold or pet a bird, since they aren't like dogs or cats. You can stroke them gently with one  fringer for petting, and you can let them sit on your finger for holing. After they get used to you, they will allo this, and if they are well trained, they will sit on your shoulder. But to train them, takes alot of time and patirnce. Even to train them to  get onto your finger. After you get your budgie, you may want to Googe "Budgie/Parakeet Training."    But before you get your bird, don't forget, it will live for 10 - 15 years. If you don't want to be responsible for something for that long, get a hamster. I don't know how old you are, but if you are planing to go to college/university in the near future and there is a no pets rule, don't get a bird. Even if your parents or younger siblings ar egoing to look after it. By then, it will have bonded with you,so it won't be as happy with anyone else.    Hope I helped=)    EDIT:  Kyle's answer doesn't seem to be a very good one.    1)Cockatiels and Lovebirds, are harder ot look after, and budgies are friendly.    3) They were his uncles birds before, so they bonded to his uncle and each other instead of him.    6)  As he stated above. The birds were his uncles.  They have not bonded to him.     I forgot to mention before, but, it helps to get a baby budgie, because that way it will grow up with you, and get used to you faster.|`|vbEkYH2haa	Yes they make wonderful companions to anyone who likes birds    Get a baby directly from a breeder and not from a pet shop.  Call your local budgerigar club (they are all over the world) and find a quality breeder near to you that you can go visit and purchase a baby from them.     The advantages of getting a baby from a breeder is they are normally handled a lot more and are generally quieter.    Budgies that are in pet shops are normally breeders rejects that they dont want to sell face to face - its a really sad truth too :(|`|5bWYjqO9aa	I have one and i am a first time bird owner and they dont make alot of noise juring the night no they are very quiet!!  i love my budgie i think it was the right choice!! My budgie didnt come with her wings clipped no!! im not sure iof yours will but you can get you budgies wings clipped if you would like!! Yes they are friendly to humans but you have to train them to be!! They dont mind sitting on your finger and stuff but again you have to train them to do so!! Hope this has helped!!  :)|`|FPaJ1AU0aa	Budgies are fantastic first birds!    No, they dont make much noise chewing, but sometimes they do whistle for fun.    I think it would be a great idea for anyone to buy one.    I'm not quite sure, I got my guy from petcity and he came in full flight.    It really depends on personality, because like people, they're all different, ive held my male alot and now he's very friendly! He loves just to sit on your shoulder for an hour!    It depends on whether or not you want him/her to be calm and trust you, personally I hold mine alot and now he would trust me with his life, which to me is very important, I think owners should have unbreakable bonds with their pets.    They really don't take up much space, they are generally friendly, can talk very well and clearly if taught, and come in some beautiful colours!    I would definatly recommend them to anyone looking for a pet bird!|`|m1ypmbNKaa	1)Ok Parakeets or budgies is not a really good bird for 1st time OWNER why? Because they are not 100% friendly as other bird like Cockatiel or Lovebird.    2)At night most bird are Quite so Budgies dont really make noises at night    3)Well right now i have like 8 budgies and my uncle bought em.The bird are behaving badly to me it also killed my other BIRD!! a LOVEBIRD.    4)Most of the time when you buy a BIRD there wings are not clipped.(Because i juz got my bird today like 5hours ago and his wing was not clipped.Also when my uncle bought like 15 birds all of there wings were NOT clipped.    5)Well this one it really depends if u know how to treat the bird and it also the bird`s behavior so its kinda hard to tell but most of the time if u try to BOND them they will be friendly to u    6)At home when i take the Budgie out of the cage ~~~OH MAN~~~ i always get PECKED and when i take it out i have to use really thick GLOVES so they dont like to be HELD a lot.|`|h8l1H4N4aa	Great for first timer owners.  They're easy to take care of and really amusing.  As long as you keep the cage clean, make sure it always has food and clean water, they'll stay healthy.    No. they sleep at night too.    I've had about 10 parakeets in my life.  The current one is a bit of a "bully" to us (he bites sometimes).  But each one had it's own "personality".  The last one would constantly have to be on my shoulder wherever I went (of course, not outside).      The last three were clipped (petco and petsmart).  I don't remember about the others.  I guess I bought them after they had just been clipped.  But those feathers will grow back eventually.      It's important that you let them settle in after you first bring them home and let them get used to their new place before you start trying to get them to know you better.  Don't be alarmed if it stays at the highest bar in the cage or doesn't seem to be eating or drinking for a couple of days.  It's normal, they're just a little nervous at first.   Start by just talking softly to them and let them "see" you only thru the bars of the cage.  Try not to stick your hands in the cage.  It'll frighten them at first.  As long as you take your time with it and treat it gently, yes, most like to sit on your finger, or your shoulder or even on the top of your head.    I suggest you get the largest cage you can afford especially if you can't let it fly around often.  Petco often has them on sale so keep your eyes open for a good price.  Put some hanging toys in there, the ones specifically made for smaller birds.  A cuttle bone is good, too.    If you still have questions, buy one of those booklets from the pet store that'll tell you everything about the bird you plan to buy.      Have fun trying to pick one out, too.  They're all cute.|`|zRXkkh0Maa	Yes...definetely.    They practically dun make noise at night but they tend to be quite noisy and nibble at things when they are curious in the day.    I would prefer two coz' i'm sure everyone will always be busy so buying two will not let it be so lonely.    You can ask the vet to help you clip it. It depends on whether the shopkeeper wants to clip his budgie before.    Yes, only when it is a tame one or you feed it when it is still a chick.    It likes to be entertained alot but does not likes to be pet alot. It also enjoys perching on your shoulder and fingers!    (: DONE!
Rx7wv4JLaa	It could be several things, pink eye, a broken blood vessel, cherry eye, caused by a scratch etc.     I suggest seeing the vet tomorrow. They can help tell you what it is and give you the info and treatment needed for your dog.    It's probably nothing serious. How is she acting? If she is acting normal than you don't need to worry so much. I hoep everything is ok with your baby.|`|AA11887983	Any concern with an animal's eye is a reason to go to the vet.  Because of the tremendous number of causes of a red eye, it is impossible to make any determinations on y/a.  It may be as simple as a broken blood vessel and as serious as glaucoma or a tumor.  Don't panic, but get your dog looked at as soon as you can.  DO NOT put ANY medication into the eye until you have the dog examined by your vet.      good luck|`|0X4UXIBvaa	Go to the vet when my dog got it, it turned out to be pink eye, pink eye will not go away and needs medicine.|`|SYrJiDKwaa	She probably has a broken blood vessel. Nothing to worry about.  Doesn't hurt her, will go away.|`|pDPSaL37aa	It could be that she scratched her eye on something, allergies, conjunctivitis, cherry eye..etc. The only way you'll know is if you bring her to the vet.|`|Bt3Hvh5Saa	prob a broke blood vessle but first take a deep breath she will be allright and secound take her to the vet|`|kWpUh6uKaa	Did you recently  take her to the beach, or like was she digging or doing something else that could have gotten into her eye?    This happened to my dog after we took him to the beach.  I washed his eye out with a TINY bit of bottled water and made him blink a bit.    A week later, it was completely gone :]    As long it is just the white (outer) part that is red, and its not bleeding or anything, it should be fine.
ak3LNjAraa	I use K9 Advantix and I've never seen anything on my dog.  I like that it repels mosquitos too.  I always buy mine from dog.com...they are much cheaper than 1-800-pet meds|`|RFfTjnxzaa	I used to use Frontline Plus on my dogs.    Last year was a really bad tick year. I had not realized that the place had become so tick-ridden, and I would take my dogs in the forest, and they'd come out absolutely infested with ticks. I'd pull out the ones I saw and would figure, "Well, Frontline will take care of the ones I couldn't find".    I was wrong: weeks after the walk I would be finding engorged, very much alive ticks embedded in their skin. What saved my dogs was not the Frontline, but the Lyme shot I got for them.    So, I'm not really impressed with these dips...|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	I have used both Advantage and Frontline Plus and have had no problems at all with fleas using either of them.I don't live in an area where ticks are a problem,though.It's a good idea to keep some Capstars on hand,though,as when you find fleas,they have probably just jumped on the dog and the Frontline/Advantage takes 12 hours to kill the adults. I never use any type of pesticides in my  house or yard,as they do more harm than good.The ground water is already polluted with chemicals,so best to just leave the weeds and bugs alone,and those flea sprays are not good for you or your pets to inhale.|`|76nTvO4iaa	I live in North Texas & use Advantix on my beagle, basset & pom.    One hint for your yard.  Look for a fertilizer that has sulfur in it - it will keep the fleas out of your yard.  I use Howard Johnson Pasture Fertilizer & have no fleas in my yard.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Use either Advantage or Advantix.  I would pick Advantix for summer use  since it helps with mosquitoes.  Frontline hasn't worked well for the past 3 yrs here.  I never suggest it anymore.|`|Rx7wv4JLaa	Each brand does something different and some people just have better success with one over the other. Its kind of a personal preference when it comes down to it    Here is what a link a posted below says about each of these products    Advantage? (imidacloprid), K9 Advantix? (with permethrin), Advantage Multi? (with moxidectin) from Bayer  These products are available as a spot ons for either dogs or cats. Advantage Multi? is a prescription drug that also is a heartworm preventive. Advantage? seems to be very well tolerated by sensitive cats. It provides flea knockdown in about 8 hours. 100% killing can be maintained for at least two weeks. It is susceptible to wash off, therefore outdoor active dogs and dogs that swim or that must be bathed because of dermatitis must be re treated frequently. (Weekly re treatment is allowed with Advantage only?). Imidacloprid has no efficacy against ticks, but K-9Advantix?, with permethrin does. K9 Advantix is only labeled for once a month, and ONLY FOR DOGS.    Frontline? Spray, Frontline Plus? and Frontline Top Spot? (fipronil) from Merial  Fipronil is a broad spectrum insecticide available as a spray or a drip-on. Fipronil binds chemically to the hair and is absorbed through the hair follicle by the sebaceous glands. In spray formulation fipronil may kill fleas at 95% for up to 30 days after application on dogs and stands up to biweekly bathing. It is labeled for puppies and kittens of 8 weeks (10 weeks for Top Spot?). It is also affective against ticks. The major problem with the spray is the high volume of alcohol based product that must be applied. Many cats will show minor adverse reactions with this application technique. The product is labeled to be applied no more than once a month. Frontline Plus? contains the insect growth regulator, S-methoprene and so provides control of eggs and adult fleas.
FhVobWpeaa	don't use peroxide as it is now proven that it further damages tissue.   perhaps gently cleaning it with warm water would be best|`|Vh5DrXvOaa	Warm soapy water and rinse well and do that twice a day. Try to keep it clean and I would make him stay indoors until it heals.  Good luck..  Also if you do notice swelling, pus drainage or a nasty odor..get him to a vet..Probably wont happen if you can keep it clean.|`|9zOh1Nleaa	peroxide will work just be sure not to put too much since they lick themselves and it also dries out he skin. Put a small amount and disinfet it once or twice a day lightly. Whenyou can try to bath him as cats have dander.
RPTwjyjIaa	A dog who has all his shots has good protection but it is not a full proof protection. There has been some cases when a dog who had all their shots still got sick but it is not very common. The best thing for your sister to do is to take the dog to the vet and let them take care of it. Dogs with parvo have to have special care anyway. If she is worried about giving parvo to her dog she can wash the clothes she was wearing, take a shower, and spray bleach water on the bottom of her shoes. I hope this helps.|`|opjYENGGaa	Any dog can get Parvo, regardless if they have had all the vaccinations|`|z5GwTXx6aa	It's not likely that her dog will get parvo if it's had all it's shots.  Good Luck**|`|Fvuq2Nwiaa	There is no 100% guarantee with vaccinations but the chances that her dog could get parvo are very slim.
w4DIPHf1aa	80% of your beneficial bacteria is in your filter  10% in the gravel  10% on the glass and ornaments..    Seeding from the filter is the best way to do it by far.    The gravel won't give you anywhere near the jump start you want.    Fishless cycles are pointless and  a waste of 6 weeks and should only be done for fun once or if you have wasted money on a water test kit and want to use it for once.    Transfer some of the bio-media from the establish filter to the new tank the same time your adding a few fish. the bio needs the fish waste to feed.      your good to go.      Just add fish slowly like any sensible person would.      If you want to fully stock immediately then do your fishless cycle but seed from the filter not the gravel There are 3 classes of beneficial bacteria and not all of them like gravel. Just like not all of them like bio-balls.    But they all love ceramics and splintered glass      Enjoy the new tank!!!!|`|1e6e1a106474f7febf542c71a7f47818aa	Forget the gravel.  Set up new tank (pea gravel is best) and buy 6 tetras.  Keep about 2 months before adding expensive fish.|`|Nzb5QmNXaa	Read this: http://tetra-fish.com/forums/showthread....    Also, you can put gravel from your 10 in a foot of a pair of panyhose. Tie it off and let it float. It will transfer the good bacteria.    Good luck!|`|T6yYgMIUaa	Actually the best way to transfer beneficial bacteria to a new tank is to take some existing media out of your filter and use that to seed the new filter. Also, instead of doing a water change on the existing tank, use that water to seed the new tank. Insta-cycle!!|`|LmAOy0OVaa	First off, never listen to anyone that would do a fish cycle, they are no better then a person that would beat there own kids.    You can use gravel from your old tank, but a lot of the good bacteria will die when you transfer it to a non established tank because there just isn't enough on the gravel to help it a whole lot.    the best way is to use a filter from you old tank, that is where most of the bacteria is, either the sponge or bioballs, that has the most concentration of bacteria.    Just remember that if there is anything wrong with the source then it will contaminate the new one if there is any diseases in it    if you have a sponge filter you can ring it out on a new wet filter and that will help a little.    unfortunately, the best way is to just let it cycle normal that is the only true safe way to do it.    I would not personally  transfer the gravel back and forth a few times from tank to tank, as it will just kill the bacteria each time and you won't be achieving anything by it, after your done with it discard it, that way you'll know there isn't any bad bacteria or illnesses on it.|`|6L0tVhn7aa	The largest collection of bacteria will be where the primary filtration is..be it internal or external filters or undergravel filters. If the the filters are powered internal/external filters then just transfer some of the filter media to the next tank filter, if the filter is undergravel then just transfer some grave over. If it's freshwater then a week or two should be long to seed the filter enough for the cycle although water test your water for ammonia/nitrite before adding any fish (marine can take 1-2 months to cycle).    For those that advocate using fish to cycle a tank....your a disgrace to the hobby and should be banned from keeping pets for life...drag your **** into the 21st century for gods sake.|`|ty9HWYXpaa	mwm0788 has the right idea and much good advice. However, I'm not sure about the % stats. It really depends on what kind of filter media you have and whether or not you are currently running an undergravel filter (which I highly advocate). If you are currently running an undergravel filter, then hanging gravel from one tank in another will get you started as well as exchanging external filter media.  Actually you can get all the bacto. start you need just by transferring some water, as another answer suggested. But you should consider adding fish on or two at a time to gradually feed and build your bacto. colonies. Enjoy new tank!
MstjbpVJaa	WHAT IS IT YOU WANT TO KNOW????????
ejj2N3uaaa	It may not be you--some horses just have preferences for different bits. My green AQHA gelding is like that. He has a very sensitive mouth and didn't need a harsh bit for control, but he seemed to like them better (I have soft hands, so I wasn't aggravating his mouth). I tried putting him in a snaffle when I first got him (he was still young enough to show WP in a snaffle with two hands) but it was a disaster...he couldn't stand it. So I switched him to a plain curb (I tried a curb with a roller and he hated that too) and he did fine for awhile. Then he started throwing his head and acting super sensitive, so I tried another bit that has a shank, but with side-pull action, and a jointed mouthpiece. He seems to love it. I paid a good bit for that bit and I don't even know what it's called, but it's working great for him.    As for English, I tried him in a plain snaffle at one point and again, he didn't do well. I put him in a kimberwicke and he was great--even though I really didn't need it for control/etc. (he's an AQHA HUS horse, so I don't actually use rein contact most of the time). For some reason he just seemed to like it better. I'm now trying to get him back in a snaffle for a more traditional hunter look, but it's a long process ;).    Point being, your horse may just have a preference for certain bits. There are multiple snaffle bits out there you can try. If you've tried a plain snaffle, try a slow twist, a french link, or something like that--he may like that better. It'll also give you a little bit more control and may be enough to convince him to give to the bit without being so severe that you risk damaging his mouth. Some horses just "know" when they're in a mild bit and don't behave, even though they're great in a harsher bit (because they know what's there). My jumper was like that as a greenie--in a kimberwicke, he was wonderful, but in a snaffle, he was a different horse. Years later, I can ride him in absolutely anything and I'll have the same horse every time. It's just going to take a lot of work. I'd experiment with different kinds of snaffles and find the one he seems to like best, and then just ride in it consistently. Eventually, he'll accept it and become used to it.     Also, if he's giving to the bit and cooperating with a harsher bit but not with the snaffle, it may be a sign that he's not far enough along to really be doing it. He may need more time to develop his topline and hindquarter muscles and become engaged in the hindquarters before you ask him to collect and give--otherwise you'll have a horse who drags his hind end around by his front end with his nose cranked downward (been there, done that--finally realized the trainer was nuts).|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	Most snaffles will pinch the tongue and hit the roof of the mouth when bent inward. It could be it is irrtationg his mouth and hurting him. Try a roller bit or low port curb.|`|Spycl8Ikaa	the horse will eventually get used to it if you do it everyday.|`|qgAWMJeKaa	my horse did that, may i suggest a sweet iron roller bit? my horse fought with a snaffle and i got a shank (i ride western) she is doing alot better, but my friend had a similar problem and she changed bits from a stainless steel regular snaffle to a sweet iron horses like rust) and roller on the bit it seems to to help or get a rubber snaffle, the bit may be hurting him. hope i helped :)|`|shrdQ5guaa	What your horse needs is a flash. When your horse pulls down and wont give into the bit, it means hes trying to resist it, the flash will keep your horses mouth closed and it will basicaly fix your problem. The reason he doenst do this with the shank, is because its a leverage bit and he cant resist it the way he can with a snaffle.    Goodluck!|`|d5hWW6b0aa	Snaffle is harder try softening your hands, don't pull as hard as you would usually.|`|WRgQBOtTaa	Some horses just don't like snaffles. Sometimes you can't get them use to certain bits. A horse is usually accepted one bit that they like and don't go changing on them or you will either piss them off or they will just open their mouth and pull on it or throw their head.|`|LlVeIRHeaa	this sounds like you should use a crank noseband and flash piece so your horse shuts his trap. You should probably consider using something that you can be more assertive in, again I don't know your horse so I can't tell you what your doing wrong. But shut his mouth first, and try hacking around in a two ring snaffle.
7bbfUYUOaa	Your betta will love the bigger space, as long as it is densely planted and he has lots of hiding places (mine particularly loves hanging around in my floating plants).  Just be sure to acclimate him properly to the new tank and keep an eye on him to see if he is fighting/being bullied.    Just so you know, your pictus catfish will get freaking huge (my aunt has a couple ranging 18"-24"), as will your pleco (you can also expect up to two feet on this one), so you might want to consider getting a new tank for them or re-homing them because they will quickly outgrow your tank.  I'm not sure about the rainbow shark (since I don't know what it is/don't have any experience with them) but I would definitely check the maximum size on those as well.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Nope, I'm sure they will love the space|`|rllnRDNmaa	as long as you have other fish  and they arnt colorful and dont have long fins    the betta will fight them    unless its female  you can add manny of those in one tank!!(=|`|1D8tMCYIaa	I don't think they prefer smaller tanks, but they can live comfortably in them as well.    I've seen a pet shop have them in small cups of water and they are "supposedly" okay (I hate it though).     They will love the space, but be sure to introduce them and watch carefully amongst your other fish.|`|AA11708471	What you were told was false    this is where bettas come from  http://apvward.com/images/SeaRicePaddy_v...|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	There's no such thing as a tank too big for a betta, but there are other fishes too big to keep with bettas, and your pictus cats are probably in that category. They are predators, and will eventually eat the betta, and probably many of the other fish in your tank.|`|49IbcrLaaa	Bettas like to be in smaller bodies of water but can be put in bigger tanks, be careful they will kill other fish without regret. It's kind of a see as you go type thing for them, they are very solitary dominant fish.|`|F5izgrMtaa	No size is ever too big for a betta, the more space the happier he will be.|`|Nzb5QmNXaa	Bettas need to be in 2.5 gallons or more with a heater. A 55 gallon would be great. It's a myth that they need or want small amounts of water. What else do you have in the 55 gallon? It may attack some fish, but it all depends on its personality. My betta stays in a 10 gallon with snails because he wants to be alone (and snails look like rocks I guess). Other bettas get along great with other fish. It just all depends.    I really do hope that you can move your betta to the 55 gallon. He'll love it. Just be aware that he may get his fins stuck in the filter if he hasn't been around one before. If it happens, just put a few plastic plants right up against the filter intake. He will learn to stay away from it or become strong enough not to get his fins caught.
Pm8nsCGZaa	Could simply be the smells of the vet, the medications, other horses etc.  I had a horse, when she smelled alcohol, she knew it was shot time..she would tense up so tight I could not get a needle in her neck. I finally started using iodine and never had a problem. Horses smell things we may not.  Just a thought.|`|6GehblM3aa	Some horses REALLY don't like the vet.  I have one that is out to kill my vet.  They usually drug him and put a twitch on him, and he still tries to kick the vet in the head.  It's like taking a child to the doctor for shots; the best thing you can do is tell them it's all right.|`|Qj9pPMf5aa	He can probably smell all of the medicine- just get him used to the smells by buying small little bottles of acohuch and carrying it with you- this way he will relize that acohaul doesn't mean shots!|`|Q4JCeVB9aa	I applaud your prep time and efforts on this one.? Unfortunately, having to twitch him this time will be embedded for next time and things will never get better.? Here's my wildest idea on this one since you probably don't want to change vets.? Get an old smock, shirt or heavily scented towel from your vet and have someone that size wear it and approach your horse.Can they get near him and pet him?? Then leave.?? Repeat over a period of time.? Some vets, farriers, equine dentists, etc. do not really know how to approach a horse and besides all of the nasty scents on him, their physical demeanor screams "predator".? Then when pain is inflicted, the horse KNOWS his instinct was right.      I want an equine practitioner who is quiet and smooth and understands how to move around them without getting ticked at the horse.  We hauled a young filly to a top equine surgeon in Lexington for a ruptured navel.   He was only going to band her yet he and a huge assistant came out with a mammoth twitch.  I grabbed my husband and had to repeat twice that they were going to twitch her and my husband's eyes got huge and he said that he would hold her, but no twitch.  She was a range bred filly with no handling and had just developed some trust in him.   This vet had gone across the world for top horses, but his approach was 'let's get the job done' regardless of how we would have had to undue the behavior problem manhandling  would create.

eDySIDPQaa	The pet milk is cows milk and like any other baby it may not take it    but, my uncle had to do this and he used the same thing    little pet milk, add water, do not dilute too much and shake really hard to mix well, if it seems kinda thick, then add alittle more water.    you can feed this till you can get some goat milk replacer tomorrow...    it will not hurt the baby goat and should do just fine, you must get something into its little tummy......it can be used, but be careful not to leave too thick, or it can choke on it...and dont feed much, just enough to kinda fill the baby tonight, then get on regular goat milk replacer in am.    As I said my uncle had to do this, and it worked fine, and did not hurt the baby goat at all...just dont over do it...|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	Well,it's cow's milk,so you can't use it as a goat milk replacer.    Edit: I thought you meant that it was for a puppy or kitten.Did the mother die or she just won't feed it? Because you can still milk her and get the colostrum,even after death.It's really important for the  kid to get colostrum.    "If a kid is orphaned for one reason or another - Kids should ATLEAST receive colostrum (to boost their immune system) for the first 24hrs - but preferrably for the first 3-5 days. If mom will not let the kid/s eat from her ... then milk her and feed the colostrum in a bottle to the kid/s. If that is impossible to do ... you can purchase "Goat Colostrum" from various stores. I get mine from www.jefferslivestock.com ."    http://lilpygmygoats.tripod.com/id9.html    Here's a good site with a recipe for formula for baby goats.The recipe is off to the right side of the page.    http://www.ehow.com/how_4700362_formula-...|`|gVXDyOCtaa	I had this issue but with kittens and I found a recipe online for kitten replacement milk|`|Rwz3dkQSaa	Do not use those powdered milk replacers if you can avoid it. It's been my experience and from what I've heard from others, that kids don't tend to do well on it.     Go to the grocery store and buy whole milk. Heat it up to 102 degrees and bottle feed with the kid's head tilted upward so that the milk goes straight into the belly instead of the non-functioning rumen.    If you can get a pritchard or a lamb nipple, that'd be awesome. You can use those on pop bottles. If you can't, I'd just get a bottle with a softer nipple with an X cut into the tip.    Get colostrum if you can. If you can't get colostrum, your other option is plasma.  http://kinne.net/plasma.htm
lHMpnr1Saa	Depending on how trained the snake is, it may or may not bite. If it isn't handled much there is more of a risk of being bitten. If he is not hungry, there is less chance of being bitten.|`|MX9M36B4aa	most certainly|`|6j9EZXGWaa	Wash your hands real good before you handle your snake to remove the possible scent of food from them and you should be okay. Then wash your hands after you handle your snake for your own good.
Rx7wv4JLaa	Yes dogs can go to the washroom for attention..They do so for a few reason one is to mark, she may be doing it mark that this is her territory another is b/c they are not being let out enough, or three she is doing it b/c it gives her attention.     Scolding for going to the washroom in the house does not really teach anything on it's own and it can show her that she gets attention for going in the house which can cause her to go more. She needs to understand that A she isn't to go there and B where to go. I tell my students to redirect and reinforce. You catch your dog going in the house you say no but do not yell just use a stern voice and than take them outside..when they go outside you reinforce.     If its territorial marking... if she isn't fixed this is a good idea. It can stop the behaviour. Also clean the area using a cleaner with enzymes in it. Do not use ammonia based products they encourage going to the washroom. A black light can help tell you where the stains are.|`|T8OFsBUUaa	I would say the problem is a matter of marking territory, and seeing herself above your girlfriend. This is VERY common. And not as bad as it sounds. Your dog was there first, and that's fair, and it's probably the mentality she has.     Have your girlfriend do relationship building exercises with her - like practising sit and lay down for treats, and basic stuff your dog already knows. This will build your dogs confidence in herself, your girlfriend might bond to the dog, and it puts the dog back on the bottom of the totem pole without any of this "Be the most aggressive" approach. Plus, if good things always happen with girlfriend is around, your dog will look forward to seeing her. If she'll stoop to it, have her get on the floor and play a little, too. That's excellent for bonding.    I agree the bed thing might be confusing, and it only confirms that the girlfriend is causing your dog problems. So, either no bed at all, or girlfriend has to learn to make concessions as well. Maybe she is too demanding?     Make a concession - no more bed, but couch okay? That's up to you to decide.    EDIT: It is important to remember that your dog is not doing it for attention, and is not doing it to upset you. It's perfectly natural dog behaviour, and so you just need some restructuring. Good luck!|`|AA11887983	Before you deem this a behavior problem, you should have a urine sample analyzed.  If it is an infection, then the problem may be cleared up with some medical therapy.      If the sample does not show any signs of medical illness, then you can try to determine if there are any problems that are behavioral in origin.  Certainly, it seems as if there is some friction in the house, with the dog and your girlfriend.       You really need to talk to your girlfriend about the dog.  After all, Gracy was there first, and she is less likely to understand the nuances of a relationship.  Your girlfriend is going to have to accept that your dog needs some care even when she is there.      As for your dog, the best thing is to be consistent in your rules.  She cannot always tell when the rules are different and why.     good luck, and I hope all works out for you and Gracy|`|sNDQCpZsaa	Luckily, my mom is a dog trainer, so I have some experience in this subject! Listen, if your girlfriend is telling you to get rid of the dog, or give it less attention, kick HER out! Honestly, the dog will be more loyal to you than your girlfriend will ever be! If she goes on the couch, give her a firm, "NO", and shoo her, otherwise, she may not understand. (I'm talking about the dog, ha-ha) Dogs do smell sometimes, and only getting on the bed may confuse her about other furniture, so it may be for the best. You should get her a nice doggy bed, to make her feel comfortable. You seem ike a devoted dog owner, so DON'T GET RID OF HER! I hope this answer helps you.|`|AA11443269	Jean is right about confusing the dog, she is either allowed on the bed or not (period!)    Jean thinks that she is peeing for attention, yes that is possible but I doubt it; I think its nerves. Without seeing the situation it is hard to call.    You might be able to kill two birds with one stone; when Jean comes over take the Gracy for a walk, the two of you! Let Gracy empty out, get all her business done, and then come home. Perhaps while you are out you might want to have Jean give Gracy a treat, either something you brought along or maybe stop and get some ice cream. And let her eliminate that on the way back. But have Jean give Gracy the treat.    Now if she still spots then it is due to jealousy and they only way I know to get past the is get the dog used to her.     And keep it up where you scold her verbally when she potties in the house, but never hit her.
hSRWVeqzaa	I heard you have to be careful with bakers chocolate. Apparently a dog could eat a pound of candy w/ chocolate and be ok.  Keep a close eye on them anyway.    Your dog may have lice thats eating away the fur. We just had that happen to guinea pig. Patches of fur came off and haven't exactly grown back after treatment.  Best wishes|`|672a1d6963ce82f0b4946e0e58bceb5faa	You need to get to the vet ASAP. if you have an emergency vet, go there now.    All chocolate is bad for dogs. Dark chocolate is the most toxic to dogs. It contains theobromine, a very strong chemical stimulant that can lead to heart attacks in dogs.    Dark Chocolate contains 50% more theobromine than even milk chocolate.    You need to get to the vet and have your dog's stomach pumped to avoid chocolate poisoning depending on how much he ate.. if nothing else it can make him serious sick, so you should still see the vet even if he didn't eat that much.     You can ask about the fur around the eye at that time. like the others say, it can possibly be mange which is another thing that needs to be treated by the vet. so just go.    don't wait like some have been saying. Even a little can make your pet uncomfortably sick, and you need to have the fur looked at anyway incase of mange.|`|pEWEEUBraa	Orange-Peanut Butter  Blue -Dark    Take him to a vet imeadatly    He might have mange (the hair thing)|`|sNDQCpZsaa	The one guy is right about the baker's chocolate, that is pure chocolate. Your dog is pretty big from what you said, so a tiny piece of fake chocolate won't hurt him one bit. If it were a smaller dog, it wouldn't be as easy to digest. About the dog's eye, definitely see a vet!|`|MgVsnEKvaa	unless your dog starts throwing up, he should be okay. chocolate isn't good for dogs, but unless he's eaten a lot of it, all he'll have is a little belly ache. my 20lb. dog has gotten into a pan of brownies before and he was fine! i wouldn't worry too much:) as for the other problem i would check with your vet..|`|HEoltdAQaa	Take him to a vet imeadatly!|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Call vet asap - chocolate esp. dark can make your dog quite ill.  The  other thing sounds like mange. Take to vet!|`|JsBb732Maa	Sometimes losing hair around the eye is puppy mange, he needs to see a vet to get checked for that. As for the chocolate call the 24 hour ASPCA hot line 888-426-4435  Hope that all turns out good for your puppy.
280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	She's your average Lab puppy, too friendly and pumped-up for her own good. Yes, she will likely mellow out as she grows older, although there's no guarantee. Is she actually being problematic when she's excited? Sniffing, tail-wagging and panting sounds completely and totally harmless. Does she pull when she sniffs around? Does she jump, mouth or behave in any other offensive manner? As it is, there's nothing really to correct, because there's nothing wrong with being an exuberant, friendly dog unless she actually acts out because of it.     As for the commands, you just need more practice! Train in public as often as possible. Begin in the easiest places she's most familiar with, where you're pretty sure she'll obey. Do a session there for a couple minutes. When she obeys consistently and to your liking there, then move up a step to the next place. Don't move too quickly, don't increase the criteria until she's fully mastered the step she's already on. Also, make sure you're using the best treats possible! Don't settle for the same old boring treats. Find the treat she'll do anything for. Chicken, cheese, cut-up hot dog, experiment until you find the golden treat. Then practice, practice, practice!    Don't forget she's just a puppy. Don't expect too much of her!|`|O1y1IGxraa	some dogs never grow out of it even with training not tryin to bum you out but i have two labs I have spent over $300.00  on each of them and only one took to the training|`|u12ZCegEaa	She is still a puppy... give her some more time.. next time you go out for a casual walk.. take nice juicy treats with you, and when he barks or jumps around to go to other people.. then distract her with the juicy treats that are waiting for him =]    try it.. i hope it works, because it works on my 4 month old pitbull!      good luck!  =]|`|p1DXTSqOaa	I have grown up with labs and when they are puppies they get excited when they see new people or something new. After a couple years they grow out of it. They usually become very calm. The only lab you really have to be concerned about are the chocolate labs. I don't think that is really a behavior issue. All the labs we have had have been like that as puppies then they grow up and calm down. They do love people and are friendly dogs. So when you have visitors she will probably want to say hello and want to be pet and loved like mine do . Honestly I wouldn't worry to much about it. She seems to me like a typical lab puppy and right now in my house we have 3 labs. They are probably the best dog you could possibly have. They are usually a little crazy as puppies. Just keep up the training. Labs are very smart dogs. Good luck!|`|n6DGucxNaa	your pup needs mental stimulation not just 'sit' and 'stay' they are very smart dogs and like us after a really really intense work out out endorphind are high and we feel like we have achieved something - the dog also needs to feel like they have achieved something too - walking in a park is boring but ad an obs course and it becomes stimualting - try to get involved in the activities you give your dog also likt jumping over a low rail or run around a group of trees - give a comand while you do it so that later on your dog will know what is happening - try to jumble up the obs course so it is stimulating but make sure the dog knows what is going on - also try to walk it at the same time each day so that the dog has a routine and a purpose which is the most importaint thing|`|T8OFsBUUaa	I'd say it's part of the breed - labs are very high strung that way, and love to go places and see people. Seven months is pretty young.    You could try a focus exercise, where you get her to focus on your face. You can lure her gaze to your face with a treat, and use the command "Focus" or whatever you like.     Slowly work up until she can do it when she is excited. Then ask her in public, and she will look at you. If you can hold her attention for a few seconds, it should calm her down.    She will grow out of it, though.|`|AA10112346	Yeah obidience. like "shh" or "stop."  there are classes for this.|`|0X4UXIBvaa	Awwwwwwwwww she is just a baby. She is a cute little puppy who likes the outdoors you can't change that with any method. She will probally grow out of it though, but she will still want to go on a lot of walks. =)|`|pTVxGebbaa	I have a lab too. When she was a puppy she did that stuff all the time, tail wagging so fast it almost cuts your leg of xD. But as they get older and wiser and go through more obedience school simple commands such as easy and stop will work perfectly. My dog is able to walk without a leash now and is only 4.|`|qqUvoC5uaa	Have you tried obedience classes?  She is still a pup after all, but it's always good to start early.     She's doing this because for one, she's young, and tow she's excited. It's a new setting for her, new people, new smells.  It's going to take some socialization and training to get her to behave well in public. You can try using treats although they may seem like a crutch, they are generally the most effective to get a dogs attention in a situation such as that.

I would -seriously- suggest taking your guinea pig to the veterinarian. I understand that you are probably trying to save some money using natural remedies, but you have a pet, and it is in pain and ill (as you suggest), it needs immediate, professional medical treatment. I'm not trying to come across as mean, just stern. Again, I would -seriously- suggest taking your guinea pig to the veterinarian.|`|bEQn0Vrtaa	being a guinea pig parent means a large responsibility, one bad thing about these adorable little things is when you know that they are sick it is usually quite far along so far so that natural remedies are for the most part a death guarantee .You must take it to a vet ASAP, as it is suffering and clearly has an infection that can take it life quickly.|`|ZGLbVjgTaa	thats natural.  i got plenty of guinea pigs here.    they are hungry when they squeak.  maybe it so happened that you saw him doing it at the same time|`|W7iKR944aa	mine did that all the time, it grew out of it. yours is gonna be fine|`|oNxq0oCYaa	Maybe she keeps seeing a boy guinea pig.|`|xkGFtWwLaa	Ha ha, chuckle chuckle, giggle giggle,laugh laugh.Maybe it wants to make sure you know it needs its cage changed.

If she's on a dry food, supplement with leafy green vegetables--not iceberg, GREEN.  3.  No dairy.  4.  Choose a guinea pig food--don't sub. rabbit--and make it high quality.  See the link below for some standards.

H06PtiIAaa	adult marllins have no natural predators except humans would over fishes these animals.    Most sport fishing is no catch and release in order to protect their species.    They are actually alot of different marlins that make up the bill fish group, white marlin, black marlin, spotted marlin, blue marlin, sailfish, long and short nosed spear fish, etc.    So they can vary in size and coloration.    A cool fact is that that sailfish can actually change color, their sails help them get light and heat up and their body actually changes color based on mood.    They will hunt fish, they have been known to hunt in packs even though i believe they are loners.     They live in the open ocean, very popular in the pacfic by hawaii.|`|PCb44JoWaa	what do you mean by conservation?    Enemies are mako sharks, a fun fact about them is that they are pelagic which means that they swim and get fished all over the world. They can swim up to 50mph.
Rx7wv4JLaa	estrus cycle (heat cycle) consists of 3 stages. Average cycle last approx 21 days    proestrus: the dog starts bleeding from the vulva and develops progressive swelling to the uterus.(lasts 5-9 days on average)  Estrus: the bleeding diminishes but the vulva remains swollen (6-12 days on average)  Diestrus: the dog comes out of heat and the vulva begins to return to normal.      Most vets will not spay until their heat cycle is done. You should wait approx 21 days from when she first started bleeding.|`|AA11887983	Usually if you schedule the spay surgery for about 6 weeks from now, then you should be safe.  The bleeding is the beginning of the fertile period, so just be very careful and do not allow your pup to be around any intact males or outside unsupervised, even in your own yard for the next 3 weeks.     On the bright side,  having had to wait for the dog to go through a heat cycle will allow your dog's vulva to be a bit larger and decrease the chances for large folds around it that can lead to infections.     Good luck!|`|okdPuy1Kaa	Check with your vet, mine will do the spay while they are in heat. It depends on the vet's preference, and some vets charge just a bit more if they are in heat.... Just call and ask!|`|CtYqMs5Paa	Bleeding lasts on average from 14-21 days.  After bleeding stops make the appointment to have her spayed.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	The bleeding itself only lasts a week or two (7-14 days).  The whole heat cycle lasts a month.    If she started bleeding on the 26th she should be done by the 10th of Feb.|`|AA11443269	The bleeding will generally last for an average of 3 weeks or less. But usually it will only be visible for a few days.    As said before when the heat is over, get her fixed (spayed), although it can be done while in heat it isn't advised.    A spayed dog will not be able to get cervical cancer and you won't have to worry about her getting pregnant; a win-win situation.|`|aB1Fibojaa	watch out if shes a outside dog cause they trying diging a hole to get out|`|wK5k435Waa	You have to wait Five Heat Cycles to get it spayed. Otherwise it will cause internal bleeding. This will result in a severly ruptured Hyper-Spleenadic Pyropseudonimic Failureishism(otherwise know as AIDS in combat with Super Herpes.) Otherwise known as The Snuggie Syndrome or TSS. Some people call it GGDUSM for short. However, I prefer to call it by its Latin name "en heatro". Not to be confused with in-vitro. Because this is completely different, in-vitro has to do with sperm and stuff.

Yr4eBnXlaa	Anyone offering a Grey cheap or free is trying to saddle you with their major expense (vet bills, medication costs, or serious behaviour issues that make you wish you hadn't taken it on.)    Do yourself a favour and meet and handle any and all birds that you are considering, before committing to the 'seller.'  Keep in mind, that most birds with behaviour problems, mask their bad behaviour until they have lived with you a while (until they are comfortable around you), then they "let their hair down" and act up for you.    Just so you're warned.....|`|pDPSaL37aa	Check on petfinder.com or your local animal shelter.|`|Mg8zk1n7aa	Also keep in mind that if someone is offering a 'free Grey', that bird could have health or behavioural problems and the seller may lie about things. I'm just saying be careful. And there are costs in caring/feeding a Grey - it's not just the initial price that is expensive. Is this your first time buying a bird? If it is, you might want to consider a different bird.    Feel free to email me.    Good luck.
NnYB9eXiaa	Hi :)    Take her to the vet.  Animals don't always have visible signs when they're hurting.  An injury won't make it any less hungry or thirsty like an illness will.    Do *not* attempt to push it back in yourself - that's like saying, "My best friend's eye is bulging out, should I push it back in or take her to the ER?"    The vet can tell you if she's going to be ok with the eye as is, or if any additional action will need to be taken.    Good luck|`|f633886f4ab9993e966868c8e49ab87baa	Sometimes when hamsters can't breathe or get squeezed their eyes pop out of their sockets. I don't know if the eyes can go back in, but if you haven't squeezed him then there is a bigger problem, he could have a breathing problem. Regardless, you should go to a vet as soon as you can.|`|KBlPoIxYaa	you have to take it to a vet and don't touch it .ITcould get infected the vet will do the job:)|`|8WEFPUDUaa	well it is probly because it is focasing. i read in a book somewere that tey do that sometimes to focous like some onther way they focous their eye is to tilt their heads. but u may want to go to a vet just incase it is something els.|`|9Mjjbyijaa	it should go on ripleys believe it or not
Y8MZCLIQaa	He could have a fur ball, if you can (without getting the absolute **** scratched out of you) open his mouth and have a look in his throat, make sure it's not blocked. If he seems to be able to breathe fine then keep an eye on him, he may just be having a bit of trouble hacking it up. Make sure he has water and if he doesn't manage to get it out take him to your vet. He may have something stuck further down his throat.   Good luck.|`|oytsL4EZaa	TAKE HIM TO THE VET!|`|4hNRTWtDaa	Why are you asking this here?  He probably does have something stuck in there.  Take him to the emergency clinic, NOW, before he hurts himself!
A7JrtFI9aa	your cat might have a very sensitive stomach like my cat does, he throws up all the time after he eats. we took him to the vet a long time ago and there wasnt really much they could do.. they just gave us some special cat food that you can probably get anywhere or at any grocery store. this kind of helped but the cat food was really expensive so when my cat had eaten all of it, we didnt buy anymore. my cat eventually got a little bit better, because we stopped giving him so much food at once. he still vomits every once in a while so we just let him go outside after he eats for a few minutes.|`|tyvFUPOxaa	Sounds like he has something hung in his throat or an injury in his mouth. Be careful when you examine him. And good luck.|`|xKOPskv7aa	He might not be able to pee very well. Has he been going to the bathroom? If you aren't sure or see him struggling in the litter box, he has to go to the vet ASAP. Eventually he could plug up completely and will die in less than 24 hours if this happens.   This happened to my cat.|`|lM5O8RB2aa	give him a couple more days humans get sick to :]|`|FhVobWpeaa	might be a hairball|`|fHJcGAyTaa	Sorry, you simply have to take it to the vet.  Its sick and it could be anything that wrong.  Its actually a crime to not seek vet assistance for s sick animal not to mention mean.  take it to the vet and ask to pay the bill in installments.  it could be twisted intestine, poisoning, anything really.  I hope hes ok.  go to the vet!!!|`|nIsV5iK1aa	My cat did that also after she ate a string off a pot roast.  She was sick and wouldn't eat or drink.  We had to take her to the vet for an IV after a couple days.  The vet gave us some stuff to feed her.    They said it was basically flavored Vaseline. so if you don't have money i would recommend putting Vaseline in its mouth.  The flavored stuff we put on her paws and she licked it off.   She didnt like it but she got better.  We gave her about a tablespoon a day for hte first week then about one a week after, she also has hairballs.  if you havent had any pot roasts lately, maybe its hairballs!|`|A0iYhhUFaa	He needs to go to the vet...no questions asked. Most vets will have at least a payment plan and some will even reduce the costs if you are really bad off and cannot afford it. But you are legally obligated to take him to the vet, if you don't you can face not only a fine but in some states jail time. So just suck it up and take him to the vet, and if you really can't afford it then you need to give him up for adoption to someone who can, and remember this could be anything including something that he may have to be put to sleep because of so brace yourself for the vet visit. But PLEASE get him to a vet ASAP!!!!
Yu7y6yfraa	This is extremely hard information to digest.  My heart bleeds for you and your family.

When it comes to making major decisions about my dogs; I have 2 things that I ask my Vet.  First, I ask if my dog is in pain.  Second, if my dog is in pain, I ask if there is a way to stop it.  If not, I ask the vet, who I have been going to for 15 year, to advise me as to what she would deem to be done that would be in the best interest of my dog.  Maybe this will help you with your decision.    I agree.  Call your mom and talk to her about the situation.  You probably need to lean on her anyway.  You have a family member that is seriously ill and you need help with those.   This makes me very sad.    The information that I found is not that helpful.      Initial treatment involves medical stabilization with fluids, possibly blood transfusions, then surgical excision of the spleen. There is substantial evidence that administering chemotherapy after surgery affords the longest survival times.    I am hoping that someone will find some updated information that is more optimistic.    Your vet may be concerned with putting a dog, of this age, under general anesthesia.  It does not look that the life expectancy is increased that much, even with these intense procedures.    I hope someone finds something more positive.  I am glad that you have a Vet helping you and your pooch.      Life sure seems too tought to handle sometimes.    I came back to see if you had posted any further information about your furry friend.  Last night, I cried myself to sleep thinking about you and your precious furry friend.  I hope your mom and Vet are helping to provide you lots of support.  Also, I hope your pooch is comfy and not in pain.  Take care.|`|FhVobWpeaa	I think you need to consider your dogs needs first.  How much pain?  If it is intolerable I don't think you want her to suffer extra time.  Call your mom ask her what she really would want you to do.|`|4hNRTWtDaa	I have to agree with the person above that you need to put the need of your dog first.  I know it's hard, but if you really think she is in pain, and you aren't going to have the surgery done, consider her situation.  If the mass does rupture, she will bleed to death within hours, and that's not so nice.  Is that something you want to put her or yourself through?    From another angle, are you considering surgery?  Does your vet recommend it?      Only you can decide when it's time, and what's right for you.  Talk to your mother about it, and please, consider what your dog is going through.|`|097CKwBWaa	A spleen cancer is not something that can be staved off by a diet change...    The major concern is the spleen rupturing which would kill the dog.  This can happen with contact so my best advise would be to be very careful with her abdomen.  Give her lots of attention with head and neck scratches but not belly scratches or hugs around the chest/belly.    An enlarged abdominal organ is likely to put pressure on other organs which is likely to cause pain.  I would say it is a good idea to have some pain medication just to make this period easier on her.      This is a very important week...|`|AA11703652	You have my sympathies- this is a crappy situation.  (I'm in tears just thinking about this...)  As long as she is not in obvious pain, I think I would just baby her as much as I could.  Offer water often, don't ask her to do things she can't do anymore (can she get outside to GO?), stay with her as much as you can.  I have no experience with this particular splenic cancer, but I have had several beloved old dogs die of other things, like kidney failure.  Do your best by her, as she has done for you for so long...and if she seems to be in pain, consult the vet about pain amelioration.  We have always been able to tell, as weird as this may seem, when the dog is ready to go...and then taken her (yep, always a "her") to the vet for the "kindest shot", once in the middle of the night.    She may try to hang on until your mom gets back--it seems they often do.  My thoughts are with you and your sweet companion.  Try to comfort yourself with the fact that you are obviously good and responsible owners and that you enriched her life, as she did yours.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	She might could hold on til Fri.  There is nothing you can give to her now esp. like vitamins, the vet is doing what can be done.  Just keep monitoring her & of she seems to be in too pain please let her go regardless if your mom is there or not.  For all the unconditional love she has given you & your family, she deserves the same consideration & love in releasing her from so much pain & worry.
AA10852907	My first thought is maybe he got into or near something toxic.      If my cats sit on the kitchen window sill, while I am doing dishes, they start drooling -- the molecules in the air from the dish soap is too much for them.      Have you used any cleaners that he may have breathed in heavily or walked through?      Another thought is tooth or gum injury.    Sorry I can't be of more help.
xTQPiA6Yaa	It's probably nothing serious. Your cat probably was scratching his/her ear and it cut them or took some of the hair off its probably nothing but if your worried about just keep an eye on him/her if they start acting strange then i would just take them back to the vet and explain to them how they have been behaving since the last time you saw them. I really hope i helped and i hope your cat is ok!  good luck! I love cats myself i have many of them.
BYoVsKY4aa	Trainability is based generally on a dog's breed and gender (at times). There are extremely smart large breed dogs, such as the German Shepherd Dog, the pick of most law enforcement departments specifically for their trainability. Some breeds of dogs, however, such as the livestock guardian breeds, are not as easily trained because they were bred to be bonded with their herd instead of with humans. If you choose a dog, you should research the breed (or 2 main breeds, with a mixed dog) and determine if the breed is right for your lifestyle and expectations. Also, a female dog does better with a male owner, and vise versa.  I do prefer medium to large breed dogs, since I am very active in weight pull and protection training. However, I have seen a Jack Russel Terrier (now called, in AKC, a Parson's Russel Terrier) in protection sport.  I spend at least an hour a day training an adult dog of any breed. For puppies, I do 5-10 minute sessions a few times a day for training. The training time should be consistent with the dog's age, maturity, and attention span.|`|49IbcrLaaa	All dogs are the same to train some breeds are just more stubborn then others. Positive reinforcement & treats are the best way to go... negative/punishment causes bad behavior/anxiety/stress.|`|qqUvoC5uaa	1. No  2. Yes  3. In what sense? Do you mean training?    It all depends on the breed. Generally speaking, bigger dogs tend to be more easily trained (obediencewise)|`|280d96ad7b5e9ffad03a34a66cac5db0aa	Of course not, all dogs are dogs. Size has absolutely no impact on their ease of training.     I prefer large dogs.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	Nope.    Yep.    Depends on the breed.|`|sA5smsSgaa	No, they are not harder to train.   It depends on each dog and the breed, and your technique of training.    I personally prefer medium to big dogs (:|`|opjYENGGaa	No, they are easier to train and are more willing to learn (in my experience). Smaller dogs seem to be harder to train.    Yes I do, but I have a small dog and a big dog (well, she will be when she's older).    Everyday! I love teaching Indi tricks. :)|`|a4eca20886ed5136a1b67933a28ef01baa	The size of the dog doesn't make any difference how hard it is to train.  It is the dogs inteligence level and willingness to please you.|`|Rx7wv4JLaa	No, i find larger and medium breeds are easier to train then smaller breeds, mainly when it comes to housebreaking. However personality plays a big role.     I prefer large breeds    As much time as was needed. Each dog will be different
z5GwTXx6aa	Duct Tape**|`|tPGxPDvBaa	tape or there are small rubber brushes that do a good job.  They are smaller versions basically of the rubber brooms used for cleaning up hair off the floor which work great btw.|`|GHpcc5iKaa	lint roller!|`|AVfPXkEraa	I agree - a lint roller! Also works great to clean off a pool table!|`|P4vRH5Ufaa	Duct tape works wonders, as does a lint roller.  The best thing to do is really avoid the problem hang your coat in a closet with the door closed and brush your dog frequently.  It works for me.|`|c6qpRqF5aa	vacuum it off
bDPVRtCNaa	The oranda could very well have died from the tank itself. A five gallon tank cannot harbor enough beneficial bacteria in the substrate and filter media to break down the waste of a goldfish. It's often said that goldfish can produce as much as 40% more waste than other fish. Ammonia poisoning is a common issue when goldfish are not kept in large enough tanks.    The minimum tank size for a fancy goldfish is twenty gallons with double the filtration.    Erratic behavior is usually due to poor water quality. Do you regularly test your water?    A five gallon tank is really only large enough for a few guppies, or a single male Betta with some African dwarf frogs.|`|kzLJbZMBaa	too many water changes? I think you're water changes should only be 50% once a week.. if you want to do it every day do like 10%? try that for  a while|`|PnQCEIeLaa	It isn't the snail ...Is the water room temp , it is suppose to be that way ...Goldfish are cooler water type fish ..When you clean your aquarium out use salt , cause it can be cleaned out quicker ...No chemicals left ..But also don't clean your aquarium but once or every once in two months ...Cause any fish go through shock when their water gets changed ..
9zOh1Nleaa	If your cat has been hiding or avoiding people here might be a problem. Animals do thatvehen heybare in pain. Howvever simply being tired and not hungry shouldn't worry you too much right now. He just had a surgery that will effect his behavior and personality. Give him some time to adjust though he might be calmer and lazier from now on. If you are still worried just give a local shelter or get a call and ask questions. Usually they will let out know if it's serious or not.  Also try petting or playing with him. Add a little catnip to his dish maybe it'll cheer him up! I find that it usually takes 1 1/2 -2 before they act normal due to the stress their body went under. Remember they are smaller than us and those are major organs.|`|Pao1xVggaa	The fact that he has not eaten anything can be a serious sign.  I would call the vet and let them know what is going on.  They can give you better advice than anyone on here.|`|A7JrtFI9aa	he could just be tired from the surgery, my cat did the same thing.. humans also do the same thing when they are recovering from a surgery. i doubt it is serious, but if you really get concerned, the safest thing is to take it back to the vet|`|fhyYh3Dzaa	Being sleepy is normal because he was put under. When my cat got fixed she was out of it four a few days.|`|4hNRTWtDaa	NO.  Call your vet.|`|Nnplp5Qqaa	Yeah  he's just woozy; cats do that|`|YFhIDBp6aa	how old is he ima get my cat fixed and now im worried if i should|`|RAtgv9GHaa	Yes,That is fine.  i would call the vet If he gets worse.
MX9M36B4aa	Go to www.reptileguru.com they have great deals and quite the variety|`|QNdpLJmfaa	Get a central american boa a male they will hit about five feet and look identical to redtails which are much bigger|`|6j9EZXGWaa	You may be ready for a jungle carpet python. They have unusually large heads and are attractive snakes. If you prefer boas, look into the Dumeril's boa or the Hog Island boa.|`|FPaJ1AU0aa	Ive always loved Rainbow boas! and Red tailed, but I dont think they stay 5ft.    Hmm....Maybe look at Jungle pythons as was mentioned!|`|vwEnKqZ6aa	i would suggest a colombian rainbow boa. im about to get one really soon. femalse usually dont exceed 5 1/2 feet and males usually dont exceed 4 1/2. they are beautiful snakes. since u are an experienced snake owner u are definetly ready for this snake. u should take this snake into consideration. they are so many cool snakes out there and the rainbow boa is only one of them. but it is definetly one of my favorites|`|pcvcMePXaa	well if you want a smaller boa i would suggest the rosy boa, they dont get over 3 feet, maybe a milksnake those come in some beautiful morphs but some females get to 6 ft so maybe a male milksnake|`|4CuxzUioaa	how about none! they bore me too tears. if they could speak it'd be somthing along these lines. "hey look i'm laying in a heat lamps rays....stilll laying...still...i'm hungry...eats mouse....i'm laying again...still laying...laaaaayyyying......hungry pops head up to the top of the tank and moves a bit and then says....i'm tired time to laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyy... doooooooooooooooooooooowwwwwwwwwwwwwnnnn...|`|NIPmV4uMaa	Ball pythons are my personal favorite, but it seems you already have some.     Boas are really cool. However, most species normally exceed 5 feet. Except sand boas, like you said, and others such as the rough-scaled boa, but their heads are like sand boas' and aren't distinct.    I think rainbow boas are really cool. They usually avg out around 5-7ft though. You may also decide on a columbian (aka central american) boa, which isn't nearly as big as the red-tail boa. Many get these two species confused. Though there are red-tail/columbian hybrids, I believe, they are totally different species.            Aside from boas, I also think that short tailed pythons (Blood Pythons, Borneo Pythons, and Sumatra Pythons) are really cool, though they are pretty snappy and may exceed 5 ft.    Others to consider:  rat snakes  rough green snakes  Dumeril's boas  house snakes  children's pythons    If you decide to get a somewhat-large snake that averages out around 5ft, it may get bigger.However, male snakes are usually a good foot smaller than females, though there are always exceptions.    Whatever you chose, make sure to do your homework and NEVER get reptiles from chain pet stores (PetCo PetSmart, etc)! Good luck and have fun!|`|2Ulvd56Kaa	Maybe a Green Tree Python?     They are attractive snakes also & Probably a good next stage. But grow about 5 and a half foot. They dont need Huge longe tanks though because they spend nerly all there time on a tree branch.|`|VFx4YHFEaa	Go for a red tailed boa, they are great starter boas and very Beautiful in color.
Vh5DrXvOaa	My cat did this. The kittens are in their own sack, my kitty had one and of course it died and then 2 weeks later here came 4 more. Just keep a close eye on her.  Does your vet have an after office hour phone number? Call the main office number and sometimes their answering service or answering machine will have a number or beeper number you can call.  Good luck|`|6qPndPvXaa	there is a 1800 number for live vets 24/7  ..your going to have to google..for it...but not to be blunt but you need to after this litter get your cat spayed...we don't need more kittens being fed to snakes from sweet people looking for a kitten for their little girl...they feed them to snakes or use them in dog fighting...enough said
L6w8YmoOaa	You gotta call Ceaser Milan!!!|`|bpyx92GZaa	I have a puppy and I went out and bought him a crate that will fit him snuggly as he grows up, I bought him a bunch of toys, tug toys and when Im not home, he goes in there with some of his safe toys and a old shirt with my scent on it and he calms down fast. When I'm cleaning, cooking, helping the kids out, he goes in his crate but the rest of the time, I have him on a short leash so I can see what he is doing and hes right where I can see him. At night I let him have the run of the room I am in and the kids and I play with him until hes worn out...lol I don't know what kind of dog you have but mine is a lap dog and he settles down as long as your rubbing his tummy, he will snore away on you..lol If you want to watch a movie with your husband, put the crate in the room with you and put her in there and she will settle down. Your puppy is looking for alot of attention because she was alone all day and she is happy to see you all, she is like a little kid when the parents come home, they are excited to see you, right? Same thing for a dog. You should see mine when we come home...lol, he acts like we have been gone for a year...lol  If it gets worse, you need to call a dog trainer. I wish you luck :o)|`|GoWPQvgHaa	We just got a puppy a few months ago and she's nuts.  But the thing is, if they do something wrong stand your ground and give them a solid serious "No!" and let them know your disappointed in them.  And little spankings wont hurt either, nothing too aggressive.|`|EQydFhzmaa	OMG this is so easy. You are obviously oblivious to the fact that your puppy is very insecure without you. She needs attention and stimulation, in other words, you can't leave her alone. You should try hiring a dog walker (and make sure you check them out), get some new toys, or perhaps look into getting the puppy another puppy friend. Good luck.|`|aeiP74PLaa	so leme get dis straight...she is by herself all day n she only does it when ur home not paying attention to her?? I think Alex is on to something cuz im stumped 2...|`|zO7Wy2qSaa	Hi, please try exercise that would drain her energy level. Can ask her to fetch her ball and tired dogs make obedient dogs.    If my dog is mischevious, I use a cane (of coz, hit her lightly but ensure she feels the pain) so that she can learn that she is doing something wrong.    Alternaltively, put her in her play pen and ignore her when she destroys something (This will tell her that she has did something to piss you off).|`|Bge5zjJYaa	maybe its time to put her down sometimes there is nothing u can do with a red flag case      OR YOU CAN PLAY WITH YOUR F****G DOG INSTEAD OF NEGLECTING IT SOME PEOPLE SHOULDNT OWN DOGS IF THEY CANT GIVE THEM THE ATTENTION THEY NEED|`|XywHOzKCaa	See if you can get in touch with a dog trainer. Explain your problem. Buy something to occupy your pet, while you are gone, such a bone.    Good luck!|`|opjYENGGaa	Destruction comes from boredom. How often do you play with your puppy? Do you walk her every day? Dogs need mental stimulation. And just so you know, she's only young so she's expected to chew due to teething.|`|FhVobWpeaa	get a crate for your dog put her in it whenever she cannot be supervised.  When she is out of the crate have her on leash so you can monitor her behaviour and prevent  these kinds of incident.  She may need more interaction time with you, she might be bored this is typical behaviour of a dog with a lot of energy and no constructive way to use it. plenty of play and exercise will tire her out.  give her some doggie toys that she can chew on to her hearts content, she needs this as she is about the age to start losing her baby teeth and this could also be a contributing factor in the destructive behaviour of late.|`|EkdjQBIuaa	i think puppies need a lot of attention, and care by the owners. my puppy used to be the same, destroying the house, the backyard, socks, shoes etc. i guess all puppies go through the stage of 'childhood' in human terms. just pay a little bit more attention to it, try to play and walk it a lot, so it gets tired and can sleep most of the day. In a few months it should stop as it gets older and more 'mature' if i can say.  hope this helps|`|bb60640c96610ff5b7eb5df5251f191caa	She needs more exercise, and more supervision. You can tie her to you while you watch a movie, give her a yummy chew toy occupy herself with.     When you can't supervise her or tie her to you, she needs to be in her crate.|`|49IbcrLaaa	A thing that worked great for my dog was a kong with peanut butter, or one of those toys that only dispenses treats when it's rolled a certain way (buy some food that you don't feed her daily and put that in there instead of treats it's cheaper) she is probably just bored & lonely. Good luck!|`|pTQFAymZaa	yes my baby boy did the same thing when sleeping i would scold him and he evetually stop doing  it went threw about 2 covers and if he still chews the blankets i would cage him  until he  know it is not going to be tolerated so far so good and he is a year old as for watching telivision i put her on a leash  and have her watch tv right along with me that way she can not destroy any of your belongings.my 3 all love watching tv  i would say keep your eyes on her at all times until she stops destoying your stuff  and def,give her lots of love
Gdcc62cZaa	I definitely don't think that you should have to lose your cat so I am going to recommend something that might just save your kitty from a horrible fate. Soft Paws are a rubber-like adhesive that attach to your kitty's claws and protects it from ruining things that it scratches. Beg your parents to give it a try before dumping your kitty. PLUS they come in all sorts of cute colors!|`|iOTM1kWWaa	get rid of it.|`|GHpcc5iKaa	Get one of those card board cat scratch box things they have em at pet stores. also if there is a T.V in there turn it on cause the noise from it will make her feel like there are people in the room. Best of luck!|`|DUOoMBqoaa	Why is she trapped in rooms? Maybe she knows you will open the door when she scratches, you may just be reinforcing the behavior and probably scaring her. Try letting her roam around and when you see her doing something bad, crinkle newspaper or rattle a tin can with pennies in it to startle her. Then she will associate an unpleasant noise with the activity and gradually stop. Otherwise, you could try putting tinfoil down on the carpet. Cat's don't like the texture for scratching. I hope your parents understand that kitties scratch things, it is in their nature, and something to be considered before adopting one. Now that it's a part of your home, I hope they will be supportive. If you do have to give it away, please take it to a nk shelter or find it a good home. Don't just abandon it. Good luck.|`|67d2a15ae64481f999d40bb559aeea69aa	its probably an abandonment issue.  try getting her something else to scratch, toys to play with, or try things with catnip to get her mind off it....|`|gKMQeSHSaa	Get her a scratching pole, and some kitty toys. Play with her more often. I would hate for you to lose your cat,  hope she will stop soon. :)|`|jyYvLxn5aa	really simple solution ::  get her declawed. JUST THE FRONT THOUGH- because godd forbidd she gets out of the house- she needs some kind of defense against other creatures. all the cats ive ever had have been declawed in the front. plus when you play with them, its alot less painful ;)   good luck
qp7ssYJcaa	Do not try to bond a rat and a rabbit. You will not get good results. Never leave them together unsupervised. I would recommend putting their cages near/across each other so that they can get used to each other. If you really want, you can let them meet each other, but make sure at least one of the animals is restrained and let the other come up to it and sniff it. If either show any signs of fear/aggression, put them back immediately.|`|8irbUx4eaa	i bet so cause my chihuahua and my rabbit play together all the time!|`|GrYhFNMdaa	I wouldn't try it. A rabbit can do SERIOUS damage VERY fast. The rabbit could injure the rat faster then you can stop it. To be safe, i would say no. The rat would not have a chance if the bunny decided he/she didn't like it. Totally not worth the risk to me.|`|TgT43SM9aa	NOT if the rat hasn't eaten in a while.|`|2iqSofzYaa	i would say not... they would probably fight. i know a hamster will fight with a rabbit. i don't think they would be friends. but nothing is impossible. just don't leave them alone. watch them until u r sure they r friends
e9gXZsKxaa	They eat both live algae and algae wafers.|`|9759e8014743debd3d3fd1a7ad437c1faa	They will eat all of the above.|`|GHpcc5iKaa	Well they need live algae but you can put in algae wafers to get something started in your tank, but give it some time to grow something real cause they cant survive on em|`|PlBHhU3Kaa	ya they eat algae wafers and cucumbers and lettuce|`|YnCUyvK7aa	FM, You didn't read the article I linked to 1 other question about the hillstream loaches I answered for you.  http://www.loaches.com/articles/hillstre...    "They will take pellet food, flake, Algae wafers, shrimp pellets, live and frozen foods, particularly frozen Bloodworm and Brine Shrimp. Jim Powers feeds his fish blanched kale leaves, which they relish."    I haven't ever tried to keep these, but a fish store in my area has started getting them in, so I've thought about it.  I've seen them eating sinking wafers in the store tanks, but they clean their tanks 2-3 times a week, so they will have trouble finding any algae growing on the walls. But it's always good to supplement these foods with some algae growing on smooth moderate sized rocks when you have them in your own tank.
4Sf8hgy3aa	Wow. Be prepared for a vet visit. I can't believe you got a dog and didn't even do any research as to what it can and cannot eat. Dogs cannot eat chocolate, the sugar content and the lactose in it are toxic to them. Keep a VERY close eye on her in the next few hours.  If she has diahhrea, vomits, whines or won't stay still for more than a few minutes, take her to the vet.|`|9f5985366e1c1ff46ce53256d1a9c626aa	Absolutely not!!. Dogs don't have the organ (not sure which one) they would need to digest it. It will kill them!!! Under no circumstances, never, ever, ever, feed your dog chocolate.  Keep it out of his reach at all times.  If an accident happens, get him to the vet asap.  Hope this helps.|`|sA5smsSgaa	Definitely not.   It speeds up the heart rate, which can eventually lead to death.   Stay away from Chocolate & Grapes (Or Raisons)|`|GMrtEYj6aa	you cant give any chocolates to any dogs because if you do,it could kill her.|`|mEFtnNMbaa	The product that is actually toxic in chocolate is Theobromine and dogs metabolize it a lot slower than humans do. It also contains caffeine. These two different types of stimulants that affect the central nervous system and the heart muscle.     It really depends on the amount of chocolate and the size of your dog to determine if she will be okay. Something like a tiny chocolate chip on the floor by accident, she would be okay but if she had to much it might kill her.    Toxcity signs that occur usually within around 12 hours of poisoning include: vomiting, diarrhea, tembling, excitement, nervousness, increased urination, muscle spasms, and seizures.     Avoid chocolate at all cost is what I would do.  Hope this helps(:|`|11aoH0O5aa	Listen to be honest , Yes it is very bad to give dogs chocolate . They can die from it .     But on some weird occasions , there are few dogs that can tolerate it . I know it sounds weird but for example:    My mom has a 6yr. old Pom . Who since he was a puppy , she gave him chocolate sometimes . Well he loved it and it never made him sick . Which is strange , but he didn't .  Although she doesn't give it to him anymore but still ...    Just make sure you keep an eye on your puppy tonight and if she gets sick then off to the vet you go ..|`|kwBbKXmqaa	Chocolate is toxic for dogs! Since it is just a puppy, that could be fatal!|`|wppGdzebaa	Dear Friend,    It is common to offer sweets & chocolates OR even ice creams to our pets.  But according to me it is not wise to offer them very frequently.  Once in a while you may share your sweets with your pet.  There are chances that the dog may have seizure on the long run.|`|0f35e35fc374dea3ca1e2b585d13080caa	chocolate is toxic to dogs cause it makes them very hyper, them being very hyper beyond what is normal can make them go into heart failure. when the chocolate makes them very hyper it makes their heart race so fast it goes into failure, my dog did this with dark chocolate and i had to quarantine her for 24 hours to let the hyperness wear off.  My vet told me dark chocolate is more toxic than milk chocolate but both are toxic|`|5rvjjaVlaa	uummmmm your dog could die from eating chocolate.That is a BIG no for dogs|`|z5GwTXx6aa	Chocolate can kill dogs.|`|YGwvoUPTaa	why would you get a new puppy if you don't know much about dogs? what a horrible owner you are! all you care about is that it's cute and expensive. ugh you disgust me|`|Jg8ngWj0aa	Chocolate has theobromine and caffeine.They can effect the central nervous system (may cause your dog to tilt his head or bob,walk backwards or to the side almost as if he's drunk) and the heart muscle ( heavy panting, wide eyes and whining like he jsut finished chasing a cat;heart attack).  The amount of chocolate that it takes to poison your dog depends on the chocolate and his weight. White chocolate has the least amount of stimulants and baking chocolate or cocoa beans have the highest.  Toxic levels as per type of chocolate are:  White Chocolate. Mild signs of toxicity can occur when 45 ounces per pound of body weight is ingested. Severe toxicity occurs when 90 ounces per pound of body weight in ingested.     Milk Chocolate. Mild signs of toxicity can occur when 0.7 ounces per pound of body weight is ingested. Severe signs occur when 2 ounces per pound of body weight is ingested.     Semi-Sweet Chocolate. Mild signs of toxicity can occur when 1/3 ounce per pound of body weight is ingested. Severe signs occur when 1 ounce per pound of body weight is ingested. This means that as little as 6 ounces of semi-sweet chocolate can be toxic to the nervous system of a 20-pound dog.    Baking Chocolate. Mild signs of toxicity can occur when 0.1 ounce per pound of body weight is ingested. Severe signs occur when 0.3 ounce per pound of body weight is ingested. Two small one-ounce squares of baking chocolate can be toxic to a 20-pound dog.     If your dog isn't displaying signs of symptoms, the fat content may cause nausea or diarrhea.If this happens, watch him carefully. If his symptoms don't clear up within eight hours, call your veterinarian (if your pet is very small or young, call within four hours); Keep him hydrated. Try to be as precise as you can about the type of chocolate your dog ate, the quantity and when he ate it.     If the animal is showing signs of toxicity, he has a good prognosis if he's treated within four to six hours of ingestion.|`|VwmaWcp9aa	Chocolate is considered one of the most poisonous things for a dog to eat.  The amount you gave her could have dangerous consequences.  Dogs can, however, have carob powder or carob chips (found in an organic food store) and small amounts of white chocolate.  Never give your dog regular chocolate!|`|XQH72YZWaa	i herd that chocolate can kill dogs|`|cqEYllm9aa	OMG NO!!!! YOU COULD KILL THE DOG! CHOCOLATE IS POISON TO DOGS!!!!!!! READ UP ABOUT DOGS!!!!
RAtgv9GHaa	1.don't rub his nose in it,It was not on purpose.  2.Get him A BED and have him sleep in that.  3.If you won't buy him a bed,don't rub his nose in it.|`|9zOh1Nleaa	Cats hate dirty litter so always clean upright after they go. Also does it smell like regular pee he could have been spraying you and he bed as marking territory. It has a very distinct odor. Kinda like smelly armpits of a boys basketball team after a game with no deodorant. If it was because the litter was dirty you don't have to worry. I would advise you to get him operated asap. That helps lower chances of gettit cancer, being aggressive or spraying you. You can write me with anymore questions. Also don't use scented litter. Humans like it but cats hate it. If this continues it could e a sign that something is wrong like a urinary tract infection.|`|69K4WoSoaa	It probably was because his litter was dirty. Cats are hard headed when it comes to breaking them of a habit. Instead of rubbing his nose in it, tell him no and take him straight to his liter box. Here is a home remedies to get the smell of cat urine out of you bed sweety, very simple if you have a little time. Do half white vinegar to water, put it in a squirt bottle, spray the spot down, after that put baking soda on the spot. Since you will probably be going to bed, you can blow dry it. Lay a towel over it, and trying to sleep the best you can. Tomorrow after it is completely dry, rake the baking soda off with a butter knife. vac *** it up the best you can and Flip your mattress. It works believe me, my Bengal peed on my sons little couch and my husband didn't believe me when I told him the smell was Truly gone, and so he dug his nose all in it. I was right. Good luck. All cats have a mind of there own.|`|NflzJrEwaa	Well it could be because his litter box was dirty. This could also be because of the new environment.  He could als have an infection, like worms.  I would try and keep his ltter box cleaner, some cats are pickier than other, my cat doesnt mind that I only clean it out every few days, but my moms cat wont use the little box if it has anything in it at all. Thoroughly wash your sheets, and spot clean your matress, because if your cat smells the area, he might associate your bed with the litter box and start peeing on your bed frequently.  If your cat does this again, I would take him to the vet to get checked out.  Cats with infections such as worms have trouble controlling their bladder especially if they were sleeping and wake up with the urge to go, sometimes they just cant hold it with worms.  Hope this helps!|`|9f5985366e1c1ff46ce53256d1a9c626aa	Yes, cats will find other places to relieve themselves if their box isn't fit to be used.  Cats are very clean animals by nature and wouldn't be caught dead using a dirty box.  Clean it at least once a week maybe twice and you shouldnt have that problem anymore.
8i90ov0Gaa	I'm with Varanid on this. It's not difficult. First, I soak them and then try to rub the eyecap off with my finger. If that doesn't work, I try with tweezers. With the tape, don't use something too sticky, scotch tape or masking tape works fine, and don't force anything off, but it should come off quite easily. I also agree that I'm sure most people here saying it's bad are just repeating what they've heard rather than from experience. There is tons of misinformation in the reptile community, much of which comes from amateurs and beginners spreading this misinformation in places like Yahoo answers.|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	Varanid seems to know whereof he speaks. I have never tried the tape but would not recommend my method (forceps) for general usage. Certainly, moisture will help. Sometimes, the eyecaps will come off with the next shed. If the snake appears to be able to see well, the safest thing is to await the next shed and make it easier for the snake to do his own shedding by keeping the cage moist and providing a large rough object for it to use to start the shed.|`|MX9M36B4aa	Never do this no matter who told you that.Imagine some one doing that to you.The best way to remove this is to soak your snake in shed ease two times a day for twenty minutes each time.If you do use the tape method you can rip out his eye or cause an infection in which could make him go blind or worse death.You can buy shed ease in any local pet store.I hope i could help.Yours truly the lizard lady:)|`|eS8wuYRfaa	That is a very painful method of removing unshed skin.  Have you tried a humid box??  Warm soaks??  These are very effective methods that aren't at all painful.  If these don't work, you should call a vet, because unshed skin can cause other problems with the skin underneath it.|`|eSoU2C3Waa	nope|`|2CbfO4jWaa	ive used this method quite a few times in the past and never a problem. over all, a very effective way of removing un shed caps when done correctly.     p.s. is anyone here who is saying its bad speaking from experiance, or is everyone just repeating hear say?|`|NIPmV4uMaa	I have also heard of the tape method, but I highly doubt that it is safe. It is true that unshed skin can be harmful to a snake. I would use tape as an absolute last resort.    In the meanwhile, you should be giving your snake daily baths. Add a heavy stick or rock with a somewhat-sharp point so he can get it off himself. Also provide a somewhat-sharp item in his enclosure. It would help a lot if you told us what type of snake it is. Anyways, most snakes should have a large bowl for soaking in the enclosure. For nocturnal snakes, dump the water and refill it with warm (not hot) water right before bed. For diurnal snakes, dump the water and refill in the morning. Put your snake in the bowl when its warm so that he knows its there. Again, depending on what type of snake you have, it may also help to mist the cage on a daily basis. Before you use tape, give him the humidity he needs to get it off himself.|`|6j9EZXGWaa	After a warm 15-20 minute bath, a mild sticky tape can be used to remove retained shed on a snake's main body. Trying to remove eye caps using this method could injure your snake if you are not experienced. Snakes need to see their food and their surroundings to feel and behave normally. A snake with retained eye caps could become stressed and maybe begin to refuse food depending on the species. It may be best to have a qualified vet remove your snake's blinders.|`|lHMpnr1Saa	Don't ask the people on here!!!! Contact a local vet, ask them! It doesn't cost anything to ask a question to a vet, only to take an animal in to be checked. I personally would soak the snake in warm water, like in a bath tub, until it naturally comes off. If the vet thinks it need to be removed they will tell you.|`|owi3TGSBaa	NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO DO NOT USE TAPE, TAKE A MOIST Q-TIP AND AFTER GIVING YOUR SNAKE A WARM BATH GENTLY ROLL IT OVER THE EYE, DO NOT RUB, ROLL IT.  IT CAL BE ITCHY AND UNCOMFORTABLE FOR THE SNAKE, BUT GIVE IT SOME TIME TO COME OFF ON ITS OWN, IF AFTER A FEW DAYS IF IT HAS NOT COME OFF THEN USE THE Q TIP METHOD.  PLEASE DONT USE THE TAPE METHOD IT CAN GRAB THE SKIN AND RIP IT OFF, WHICH CAN BE VERY PAINFUL FOR THE SNAKE|`|2Ulvd56Kaa	I really wouldn't recommend that.    Put it in a damp lukewarm pillowcase or simply wait until it next sheds, If its a baby it shouldn't take too long and it should come off then.|`|8pVgbPWkaa	Its not dangerous at first, but it can eventually cause vision loss. Also, i dont really think that tape is the best way. This is what i do with my snakes:    You can get a Q-Tip and wet it with warm water. Then gently rub the eye and around the eye to help loosen the scale. You'll have to keep re-wetting the Q-Tip to keep it warm. Try to squish out some of the water, though, so that it doesnt all come gushing out all over the snakes face. Be gentile though and let the snake pull away every once in a while. Dont hold its head still, but let it just happily sit on your lap or around your arm while you do it. It'll corporate if it's comfortable.
Oiabe82gaa	If he is in obvious pain I'd call the vet straight away!    If not, try not to worry too much about it immediately. I would give him 24-48 hours to see how he is. During this time I would check every couple of hours or so for any signs of heat coming from his rear end, right from hoof to spine.  If you find any heat I would ice that area and see how he reacts/recovers.  If there is no improvement I would call your vet.|`|QTT9380Yaa	the vet will tell you..|`|Qj9pPMf5aa	that used to happen to my horse but now I have a chiropractor that comes monthly! The horses love it to and I wouldn't worry about your horse, he might just be sore, so I would gve him a couple days off to just relax!|`|ujuY7pPZaa	stifle or suspension injury possible|`|bNZrZMW9aa	i wouldnt stress to much about it, it could just be muscles sore. i know if i ride my horse too much once and a while he will pull muxcles and run werid. i would't stress over it the vet should be able to help you|`|HY2i80mjaa	i'd put him on soem bute and call the vet, he sounds like he's tying up|`|C3btl9dTaa	If he isnt using his hind legs, then that would be the problem. He has obviously damaged himself . my horse, when i bought him, cantered like that. he was very sloppy with it and did not use the power of his hind legs. so i had to train him using my seat to start using them. Everytime we canter i use my seat to to push him into it. i cant really describe it myself over this but i would ask your trainer and if they are any good they will no how to do it. remember its your seat (your ***!) that controls this.|`|w7Ma5KZcaa	he might have sore legs or pulled musles. but don't worry too much.
v6coHbIeaa	Not me|`|aeiP74PLaa	never i can never tell which 1s are boys n which r girls i always buy 2 n hope though....|`|AC8isvLgaa	my dad got laid off....uncle permantly lost his job all together.....this is my dad 5th lay off.....my uncles first ever problem like this at work...so fur us......it not too tough...we pretty much gota plan in this situation...|`|6VFh61jhaa	Well, birds don't have jobs, so I guess that they can't get laid off.    But in here in NS, jobs are really bad. Most people are moving out west where there are more jobs.
Y8MZCLIQaa	It's not recommended that you feed your cat french fries.. But since she's only getting a small amount every two weeks it's nothing really. As long as she's not overweight and you don't let her become overweight you're fine letting her have them. She'll find a lot worse things to eat on her own, out of the garbage.|`|GHpcc5iKaa	not really, no|`|KnwsvnTjaa	I think you're ok, my cat has a bite of them now and then.|`|z5GwTXx6aa	Mine love fries and it's never hurt them.**|`|gKMQeSHSaa	I guess the odd one or two now and again wouldn't hurt, everything in moderation! :)|`|RAtgv9GHaa	As long as you don't do more than 1 french frie,its ok.  Why do you give her more anyways.  Its not ok to do.|`|AA10852907	It won't hurt her.  I think it's a great treat!|`|fOT1HDn9aa	it ok to do that it fine|`|9f5985366e1c1ff46ce53256d1a9c626aa	It's never a good idea to feed animals what is known as 'people food'. French fries arent good for you so it's a pretty good assumption that they're not good for your cat either. Cats can get fat and have high cholesterol too you know.  Also when you give animals your own food, that encourages begging behavior which most pet owners don't want. I wouldnt want my cats staring me down while Im trying to eat.  Anyway, I hope that helps.  Just bear in mind if people food were ok for animals, they wouldnt make pet food now would they? :-)|`|wvyOBzmYaa	It wont hurt her.|`|9zOh1Nleaa	Well I say it's okay as long as you don't od. What you probably don't knowis that cats can't digest carbohydrates (which potatoes are loaded with). They don't have the enzymes in their saliva necessary to process it well. Just don't give him too much. My cats like olives, marshmallows and even chocolate chips. Also be advised that when you buy cat food the first five ingreients should be hinge you yourself would eat. Stay away from anything that says fat or by product.
Rx7wv4JLaa	The best weight for your dog is you shoudl be able to feel the ribs when you pet along them but not be able to see them. This is the same for all dogs of any age, breed or size.|`|W02kTOqmaa	Hard to tell. A well bred, breed standard American Pit Bull Terrier should be around 40lbs, full grown, which would be around 2 years old. At the same time, people are breeding pits to be larger and larger, so it's no suprise to see a 75-100lb pit bull.    40 pounds still sounds a LITTLE over weight. either that, or you have a BIG pit. My shepherds is almost 2, and 90lbs, and at 4 months he weighed 28lbs. So a big difference. My shepherd will probably be over 100lbs full grown.    Take your puppy to the vet. They will be able to tell you if your dog is over weight, under weight, or perfect. Without a picture to actually see, we can't tell you. Your puppy is already as big as the breed standard calls for, but as long as he is a healthy weight for HIS body, it doesn't matter      EDIT: King Molosser, you are totally correct. I try to stay clear of defining the difference between a TRUE pit bull and some bully MUTT, lol. Unless I'm talking face to face with someone, it is usually just easier to go with it|`|nI8G21y8aa	that sounds good!     COngrats on the new puppy!|`|9f5985366e1c1ff46ce53256d1a9c626aa	Sounds like it. As long as her belly's not dragging the floor and she's well muscled without her ribs being visible, she's fine.  Ask her vet.|`|CzWvNQxMaa	yup it sure is mine is 3 months n 26 pounds they could rang anywhere in that area. Ad long as it still has energy and tummy doesn't drag its perfect because some is there weight n some is there muscles. mine is a little smaller cuz she has some pointer in her so thats why she is a little smaller
N3wY2l5Yaa	When I give my cats a lot of turkey or chicken, their poos smell pretty dang rank.  Also, if your cat gets constipated, their poos will be bigger and harder too.|`|gKMQeSHSaa	What a silly question!! LOL  It could be the spam!! :D|`|9f5985366e1c1ff46ce53256d1a9c626aa	It's probably the spam.|`|RAtgv9GHaa	LOL,cute "poo'.  cats do it,like humans.
z5GwTXx6aa	Take her to the vet**|`|gKMQeSHSaa	Yep, take her the vets ASAP!! Why do people pratt about online first before doing the right thing??|`|8WEFPUDUaa	i am sry iam not  cat expert but my cat ran away and i know some.....  so every day asmuch as possibol try and get like an eye dropp the long ones and feed her some.for the food get it really mushy and try it the same way ( may i remind u i am not an expert) but make shure the food isnt chunck it could choke ur cat but get the food watery. firt of all take her to the vet ASAP. she might be sick or just need a long long rest. let her sleep and she might be freaked out for a little so let her realax and bring the food to her and just keep her in a calm part of ur home. good luck!!|`|RAtgv9GHaa	Take her to the vet.  You should have left food out in places.(the real bowl where it goes,and the rest in each room)|`|9f5985366e1c1ff46ce53256d1a9c626aa	She needs to see her vet. She needs IV fluids which you can't give her at home. She also needs to be kept warm and dry. If you don't do these things she could die.|`|wvyOBzmYaa	I am no expert on cats but if it was mine i would be taking him to the vet for a good checkup.
z5GwTXx6aa	Wolves can bark and dogs can howl**|`|3zv2bbolaa	You have been misinformed. Wolves can and do bark, but not often and not under the same circumstances as dogs. The wolf bark is used for close range communication, usually associated with defense of den or pups, a warning to back off, a protest, threat or an actual attack.    The dog bark is an all purpose communication method used to convey  loneliness, fear, distress, stress and pleasure, as well as a need for care among puppies and serve to alert other dogs, people or animals to changing external circumstances.|`|GHpcc5iKaa	wolfs can bark......|`|CtYqMs5Paa	Wolves can bark...they actually have a great range of vocalization capabilities...|`|8ebb09b16f5ff1a5448d5eab3b4b1fa4aa	Wolves also bark, which they do when nervous or to warn other wolves of danger.    Wolves bark very discreetly, and do not usually bark loud or repeatedly like dogs do.    Wolves use a low-key, breathy "whoof" sound to get attention immediately from other wolves.    Wolves will also "bark-howl" by adding a brief howl to the end of a bark. Wolves bark-howl for the same reasons they normally bark.     Wolf pups bark and bark-howl more often than adult wolves do.    ups bark for attention or for food just like babies cry for attention.    Adult wolves whimper to to show submission.    Wolf pups whimper when they need comfort from an adult wolf.|`|qqUvoC5uaa	Wolves can bark. They make a massive array of different vocal noises.|`|ZGLbVjgTaa	what a wrong question. its because of their vocal anatomy|`|sA5smsSgaa	Hmm,   I never thought about this, but I'm pretty sure wolves can bark as well.|`|opjYENGGaa	I think you are thinking of Dingoes. Wolves can bark, whine, howl, you name it.|`|Rx7wv4JLaa	Well for one a wolf is not a dog and a dog is not a wolf. That's like saying why you don't do the same things as apes.     Some wolves do bark. Just depend on what type of vocalization they choose to use.|`|bb60640c96610ff5b7eb5df5251f191caa	Wolves can bark, but for wolves this is a juvenile behavior. Wolf pups bark but as they mature they quit barking.|`|BYoVsKY4aa	Wolves can bark, however this is not neccesary in the wild. Their communication is usually either up close, or over a long distance. This is why they howl, it is an effective long-distance communication. Their up-close communication consists of growls, growl-barks yips, grunts, groans, and many other sounds.  Many dogs also use howling, or baying, as a means of communication. Hounds that have been used for hunting typically bay as a sign of their progress. Their bays will get more frantic when they are hot on a trail. These dogs often do not bark as well.|`|Xa9esMTEaa	Wolves don't bark like a dog does, their barks are short and sharp. A wolf can, however, be taught to bark like a dog from dogs. Weird huh?
z5GwTXx6aa	They should be fine.  Mine eat Ice Cream frequently.**|`|RXI8ImdIaa	Maybe some diarrhea, maybe some vomiting. Other than that, no harm done.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	My cat loves ice cream. I am sure that she didn't eat enough to cause her any harm. Worse case scenario is some vomiting and loose stool. Most likely nothing will happen,|`|RAtgv9GHaa	they should be fine.  Call the vet if they start acting weird.|`|6ZCxG454aa	They should be fine, as long as they're not sick.|`|k3AmV6waaa	Don't eat it yourself but give it to your sister.|`|A2O6t6T7aa	They should be ok except for puking unless it was chocolate...    Kittens are so funny and cute lol|`|9f5985366e1c1ff46ce53256d1a9c626aa	They should be fine.  Most ppl assume cats can't digest chocolate because dogs cant. This isnt true. Cats do fine with chocolate (although it's still not the best thing for them to eat LOL)  Keep an eye on them. If anybody starts acting strange, take them to the vet. Otherwise, I wouldnt worry.
AA11345011	I dont know|`|AA11871016	I assume you meant Ferrets?      Same thing straight people use ferrets for.  Entertainment, companionship,  Egg disposal,  hunting down cockroaches...    Gay people don't treat animals any differently than straight people.      If you're hearing things about people using them for 'other' purposes, those aren't gay people, they're people into beastiality.  BIG difference.  Also, I seriously doubt anyone could get a live ferret up their butt.|`|AA10341989	that is a very stupid question|`|ea25865a1c8855a46ead6d0c152a53d2aa	they use it to masterbate|`|8ad2711008727b92a956a04720caad4aaa	The rumor is that some homosexuals,( certainly not most of them), use hamsters to put up there butts to get off.  I guess ferrets could be used for some similar purpose., for arousal.  This is abuse to animals either way!!  Someone can be a homosexual and still be into beastiality, as I stated before not ALL homosexuals do these kind of things!!!|`|2128ca3ba5c5c028910f9811bfc4a860aa	To scare away people who believe that gay men actually let them crawl up their butt.
