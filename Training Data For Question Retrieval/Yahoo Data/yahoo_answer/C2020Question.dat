I just want to finally get my 1080p but cant seem to get any system to work through HDMI...       I bought a new ps3 & xbox 360 4 days ago. I bought a new samsung 52" LCd 3 weeks ago. I bought 2 monster hdmi cables with both systems.. one is the 800hd and the other is the 1000hd.       When I hook the ps3 up through the cables I get only a black screen. I've changed the settings on the ps3 to HDMI.. it goes black for 30 seconds then comes back to the reg screen. I've tried the 2 beep power trick to no avail. I've tried all 4 hdmi ports The tv almost always says no signal. when i use the 2 beep power off reset it goes to 480 and just a black screen. I've taken the ps3 back and exchanged it once already.      On the xbox360 the picture comes up great in 1080 but... no audio on any of the 4 hdmi ports... i've tried removing the hard drive and then turning it on... i've tried changing the setting on the tv.. just doesnt want to cooperate.

Olá amigos! estou com um pequeno problema, substitui as lampadas da minha loja de fluorescente para incandecente pois ilumina mais e além disso o valor da energia é fixo e está incluso no condomínio. No entanto após 1 mês , as lampadas come?aram a queimar umas 3 por semana! Observei que os fios que faziam parte do soquete estavam todos queimados! troquei todos os soquetes . Pois bem, após 2 semanas come?aram a se queimar mais lampadas!!! Estou na dúvida se devo refazer toda fia??o (apesar de ela ser nova, tem uns 3 anos) ou devo substituir novamente as lampadas para fluorescente. A voltagem é de 220 e as lampadas fluorescentes eram de 40W , coloquei incandecentes de 200W. é provável que esteja esquentando mto e em decorrência disso derreta os fios e as lampadas queimem? Se trocar novamente para fluorescente será que resolve o problema?

20070524205108AAKvrJ4	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	Razr VS. Katana?!?	I'm with Solo mobile, and I want it to stay that way- but I need a new phone. In your opinion is the Moto RAZR or the Sanyo Katana a better idea? I txt message more than I actually talk on the phone, so the ease of use of that feature is really important to me. I'm also kinda hard on my phones so which would you say is more durable? I have a Sanyo SCP2300 right now and it's dieing quickly so weigh in- and be specific!

20070618152558AAWTUOe	Consumer Electronics;Cell Phones & Plans	The Verizon Prada OR the cingular iPhone?	I think that both are awsome. I don't know if iPhone did rip off the Prada but it has a better design. You see, I have Verizon and my sister work for verizon, so I get nice discounts (like $200 off a phone and some other perks). But I don't know whether to stay with verizon and buy the Prada for (I think it's $600 now so minus 200 is) $400 (which is $100 less than the iPhone, I think) or should I switch to Cingular, get a contract and the iPhone? The iPhone seems cooler but its more pricey. WTF should i do??? Another option is waiting and see if Verizon will make a deal with Apple to sell iPhone and then buying it (But I may not be able to wait that long... but i'll try...) So tell me what I should do. Thanx! ^__^

20070727022643AAiacZn	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Ipod output quality limit?	mix of questions:  is there a limit for how much bitrate can come out of an ipod or other mp3 player.  i know mp3's quality max is 320kb/s.  On the ipod specs it shows 192kb/s /bitrate max i think, so is that the max output.  Or if you put a wav quality file to ure mp3 player will it be 900+kb/s. If i'm right, playing from a computer you will get to here the exact bitrate/kbps quality.      what about mp4 quality?  I used 'super' to edit stuff for the ipod before.  For condensing media you might as well leave the audio maxed for good quality and adjust the video /mp4 quality to lessen file size. anyways i think itunes is ok but i use instead winamp and 'super' and i just found a very good program for ripping and burning: express rip/burn. -thx for any input

20090225135609AALVxib	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	My mp3 is only playing ten  seconds of each song?	I was listening to my mp3 and im not sure if i hit a button or something before the next song, but the next song only played ten seconds.  Then it moved onto the next song.   It's a green 2gb mp3 by the company hyundai and looks very much like the old ipod nanos that can't play videos if that helps....      I saw a question similar to mine and the answer was that it was in preview mode, but it didn't say how to get it out of preview mode.   I have looked in settings just in case this might be the case, but i can't find anyplace from where i could change that.      Any answers are greatly appreciated.   Thank you in advance.
