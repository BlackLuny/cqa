I would prefer something I can buy from a store, but pyramidair works too I guess.

This question explains what the new TDCM Match that'll be used for the Finals is:      In this match, it is No Holds Barred, meaning no rules. There are flames surrounding the ring, like in an Inferno Match. There are lumberjacks standing all outside the ring. The only way to win is to find the hidden microphone somewhere around the ring and ask your opponent "Do you quit?" until he quits, like in an I Quit match. If you get caught in the Inferno flames, the match does not end. If you fall outside of the ring, the lumberjacks beat you up, then throw you back through the flames into the ring. There are weapons all around the ring, including ropes, wires, pipes, bats, chairs, wired chairs, wired bats, etc.      The lumberjacks included in the match are all of the best superstars from SD!, RAW, and ECW.

20090304225701AA2Hed4	Sports;Boxing	What's more surprising?	Glen Johnson UD over Daniel Judah on friday nope. Adamek TKO over Banks on the same day nope. O Saturday's fight between Marquez Knock out over Diaz nope. On the same night after the all time great fighter Juan manuel Marquez defeated Juan Diaz. Me being a boxing fanatic turned in to watch a bout in spanish language aztec america. Which featured Francisco Panchito Arce brother of Jorge Arce in the main event against Siphiwo Nongqayi. Know offense to anyone but unless you truly follow boxing you probably never heard of these two fighter's. I have to know about these things, I make it my business to know when a boxing event takes place feel very passionate about the sport. Anyways I was lost for word's when I saw you know the man himself JAVIER CAPETILLO. Unbelievable right unless you follow boxing you know what I am talking about shocking He is the trainer of Panchito Arce in the bout that took place saturday night in Toluca, Mexico. He got his license revoked in the US for tampering with Antonio Margarito's hand wraps as will did the boxer, but he's allowed to work in Mexico. Surprised to see Capetillo on the other side of the ring, By the look of it he looks like he got over the whole issue of the tampering with the hand wraps.          Source: The third box was not included.   Boxing is my religion. Have followed this wonderful sport for    17 years watch countless tapes of boxing.

It's really good except that like what everybody knows that cuetec has fiber glass shaft and what it do is it gets a lil sticky when you play for a lil bit of time. I'm planning to buy a Mcdermott since i heard a lot good things about it. Can you please check the site above and see for your self if it is a good cue? it's worth $75 so im pretty worried that it might not be too good. Need an answer from a pool hustler or someone that knows cue alot thanks!      PS.... i know some will just tell me to go to a store and try out a cue that best fits me. But it just doesn't really work sometimes like here in our place, I just can't find a branded cue.. I only can find a cue that's worth 40 bucks or less. So nowhere can find those branded cues but in the internet.

I mean if he gets a - point for not being able to collect himself and crying  does he still get his + point for collecting himself on court and having a placid demeanorr?   what's your idea? would he be treated the same if he had won the last set?   tnx for your patience on reading this and for respectful  answers

I played 2 games against 4-3-3 teams, I won one of them 2-1 ( and the goal I conceded was just stupid) and second game i lost 2-1 even though I didnt finish the game, and the 2 goals were stupid too, I passed the ball to his striker. 2nd: I lost it in the 25 yards.      But when they apply pressure, I lose the ball a lot in the middle of the field when trying to pass it to my CMs, so any idea how to not lose the ball like that ?      PS: if this can help, they just don't play sexy football or anything, they just try to pass the ball to one of the strikers, and sprint into my goal.      Thx

Well it was removed... at least the first question was.  Now I know that certain individuals near the top of the table didn't manage to answer my repost, so I have suspended last weeks pending appeal.  If the original question is re-instated the scores will be added.       What I'll do is, I'll use the first score if you answered twice.      Hope this is to your satisfaction, if not then birl.

20090305024221AAsIEfB	Sports;Cricket	The future of Pakistani cricket?	With the terrible events in Pakistan, do you think the best thing for Pakistan is to become a nation that doesn't play at home?

They are a great cricketing nation, and it would be a shame if the terrorists won, and they didn't play.
20090305033549AAl1gqp	Sports;Other - Sports	I have a problem about sports, and a tough decision?	Ok currently I run cross-country and I have ran for 7 years and I'm a freshman in highschool. I use to be top ten in kentucky for two years in a row, we got a new coach. She isn't that good and I got injuries and I'm just going to get worse and worse. So I was thinking of a new sport and my best friend plays golf and I sort of want to try it. My grandpa has wanted me to play since I was born. He knows a professional that could give me lessons. I have NO experience in gold either. I know they always say do what makes you happy well, I don't want to make a stupid choice. So please HELP! Thanks.
20090305031159AA34uuJ	Sports;Wrestling	Is anyone noticing the crowd response win Chavo comes out?	Everyone says the beginning "OOOH CHAVO" and then start booing. The Rock was like that as well in the Corporation. He has one of the most over themes in the WWE.       Also, last year Chavo played two characters in the WWE, the savvy veteren on ECW and the goof on Smackdown. Has anyone pulled that off before? Maybe the King in Memphis he was a face but in WWF (at the time) he was a heel.

I think it could be huge.  He already has half the crowd rooting against him.  And if they could do something really huge to make him become a bad guy, I think it could be the biggest thing to hit the WWE in years.  It can't be anything laim though.  It would have to be something huge to turn him into a bad guy, like maybe an all out viscious assult on Shawn Michaels or something like that, leading to a bitter bloody feud with the 2 of them.  What do you think?
