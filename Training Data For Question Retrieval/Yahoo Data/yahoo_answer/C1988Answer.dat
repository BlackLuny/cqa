p1dcw35Qaa	Could be a lot of things but probably a transformer is gone. The problem with the old CRTs is they're not worth much anymore and are expensive to fix. Although I hate to say it, and it may seem like a waste but I'd look for a new TV.

GgGNAqApaa	Well you will need a T-10 screwdriver, which you can buy in your local store or online. That's the key to lifting off the cover. I also had the same problem.<br>  <br>  Be sure to take it off carefully, after you take off the T-10 screw, you have to slide the cover, then lift it off.|`|FIL4vngsaa	WARNING: THIS WILL VOID YOUR WARRENTY!<br>  <br>  On the side of the warrenty label, peel it off. Undo that screw and then slide the PS3 face plate away from the "sucking" fan. Under this is more screws. Unscrew this to get into the disc drive. <br>  <br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>  Alternative which won't void the warrenty if done right:<br>  Use a pair of tweezers and put it in the slot and try and pull the disc out. <br>  <br>  WARNING!: The console must be unplugged when doing either one of these!
IY9JolQ4aa	Go with over the ear type. Bose makes an absolutey AWESOME pair. They sell them at target for around $150 but i've been tempted to buy them several times because they are so amazing. Worth the price for sure.
INQUeMwCaa	I would say the dare. But choose the chocolate if you have problems with typing on a touch screen. It takes time to get used to. If you prefer to keep pressing keys to type chocolate. And if you want an MP3 player. DAres are thiinner but I would think they break easier.|`|noOiZ4lQaa	the new Chocolate is ridiculous, just as bad as the others. The Dare is okay, but no real champions itself. It's a prefrence thing.|`|HS44HUrgaa	chocolate (:|`|xi9amEG2aa	Well, I actually just got the Dare over the weekend and the phone I had before was the Chocolate that slid open.  I don't know what it was actually called, but it slid open.  I LOVE the Dare.  I think it's better because of all the extra features it comes with.  It has a touch screen, virtual keyboard which you can either have the numeric pad or the QWERTY keyboard.  It changes when you turn the phone sideways 90 degrees or when you touch the button that switches it.  It has handwriting recognition, but I haven't figured that out yet....3.2 mega pixel camera which the pictures are actually pretty good, with a flash.  Something stupid is that if you have the volume turned up....it reads your text messages for you, but you have to go into the text and push a button when in that time, you could have just read it yourself.  Um, what else....oh.  You scroll through anything like your contact list or song list by 'clicking and dragging' or 'flicking' as it said in the little book.  It took me awhile to figure that out haha.  (only because I wanted to figure out as much as I could without having to look at my book)  Overall...it's just a better phone.  Close to 300 bucks, but it's worth it.  Just get a hard plastic case and screen protectors....especially if you drop your phone a lot.|`|mtAqANKfaa	oh my god, the LG chocolate is very old and horrible, i have no idea what the Dare is. <br>  But i have the LG veiwty :)|`|xFeGxPtoaa	The dare's cooler.|`|2RhTe54Raa	Lg dare.. thats obvious.. i have the dare right now|`|EuN7580Iaa	i don't know but i have the lg vu

It's one of the best shooters on PS2 that I've played, and Killzone wasn't very good when it first came out.|`|GgGNAqApaa	Well unless you like fiction i suggest Killzone 1. And also i think Socom only has Single Player.

So, check to see if your player is a DVD + or a DVD - player. Replace it with a DVD+/- player that will play both formats.<br>  <br>  This +/- difference is because of standards different between American DVDs and European DVDs.

It realy depends how fussy u r,,,With the figures the larger contrast ratio the better id say below 1000:1 is terrbile...mine is 8000:1 but if you can then id say look for 20,000:1 or above depends how much you want to spend...100Hz...1080P...chuck in a couple of slogans like Motionflow or Digital Natural Image Engine for a better picture quality and should be fine! there are some bargains out there at the moment as new untra slim lcds are coming out so gota get rid of old stock...i like to look on www.hotukdeals.com if ur in the uk!|`|5MRuCWoRaa	look for 1080p or 720p.

Then I started telling him about all the studies that say having your phone against your ear talking is bad for your brain, and if I could text it would be in my hands, not against my ear possibly damaging it. That seemed to work for me.|`|DUMYQ3Sgaa	well just say that by u texting it dose not cost as much as if u use mins|`|pZVEBEmLaa	Texting is much more safer for the brain than being on the phone because of the radiation.|`|Y7qLedwkaa	Parents always hear HORROR stories of how their kids rack up cell phone bills texting. I know teens that text upwards of 3,000 a month (and many who'd say more!) and if a parent doesn't put a texting package on the line, text messages can cost 20 cents each. That might sound small, but imagine if you sent a paltry 1,000 texts. Times 20 cents, that's an easy $200 extra on top of a bill. So you have to show dad you're responsible.<br>  <br>  Get a package that makes sense for you. Most packages are about $5 for a small amount of texting, $10-15 for what most regular texters use. Check with your provider. Also ask how you can check text messages from your phone and ask what day of the month your plan starts over. Most people don't need to spend extra on unlimited unless you're a hardcore texter.|`|ivP3uP0Paa	Tell him that u cant call ur friends and talk to them during school but u can text them all day. Im sure he would go for that. texting isnt that much if u have sprint its 15.00 for unlimited but idk if they changed it i got my plan a year ago and att has unlimited for 20.00.|`|QYbMxFE0aa	Tell him it will save minutes.|`|kyTDQEWaaa	Pay for it.|`|5homvoHkaa	Just remind him that unlimited texting is only fifteen dollars or so.  Stress on the fact that he won't have to hear you all night long chatting, and the phone bill can never be too high due to going over your minutes.  It's quiet, cheap, and ideal for uninterrupting conversations to and fro.

noU2uKEoaa	The  " unregistered sim" message may mean a couple of things.<br>  <br>  (a) The sim or phone is faulty.<br>  <br>  (b) The sim card is disconnected ( there is no phone number attached to it). Occasionally errors occur and sim cards are sold without an associated mobile number. "Unregistered sim " generally means that there is no association or registration of the number  on the cellular network and has no relation to registration of customer details<br>  <br>  You need to try your Vodafone sim card in another Vodafone handset or an unlocked phone. If you get the same " unregistered sim " message then the problem lies with the sim. If on the other hand the sim works fine in a different phone your new phone may be the problem.<br>  <br>  My instinct is that  the sim is the problem.<br>  <br>  Assuming we are referring to Vodafone UK here are some useful numbers<br>  Customer care  191 (from Vodafone mobile)<br>  <br>  Customer care  08700776655 ( from a landline).<br>  <br>  You can order a new sim (PAYT) at vodafone.co.uk or in a Vodafone store.<br>  <br>  Once your problem has been resolved then the following will be useful.<br>  <br>  (1) display number :-  dial  *#100#  <send><br>  <br>  (2) Dispaly balance on screen:-  *#1345#  <send><br>  <br>  (3) To hear your balance and use automated service dial    2345<br>  <br>  (4) Display last caller *#147#  <send><br>  <br>  (5) When you obtain your new sim the number is in a "dormant" state.<br>       All you have to do is make a chargeable call and this will activate your new number. You would do this before trying any of the above network commands as a dormant number cannot receive calls nor can it receive sms.<br>  <br>  Regarding your question about using other network sim cards; if the phone is locked then a network unlocking code will have to be requested from Vodafone. This will be provided free once you have had the phone for 12 months or longer. If you want the phone unlocked sooner the standard charge is ￡19.99.<br>  <br>  Hopefully you will find some of this helpful.|`|Ty3AiqHzaa	answer 1 .. 2345 <br>  answer 2 ...no u cant<br>  answer3 ...*#100#<br>  all the best
capqMpiCaa	Depends on what you mean by beginner. If you know nothing about cameras, and you are just planning on pointing and shooting, a d40 would be way too much of an investment, because you wouldnt be using much of the available settings that make the camera so expensive. If you know nothing about aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc... you should probly get a point and shoot digital. If your determined to get the d40, at least read about dslrs first so you can understand and take advantage of the settings it offers.|`|0AqkCOWIaa	Too Professional?<br>  <br>  No, it's not too professional. Technically, it lacks a lot of professional features. I am not getting into all of that, though. It's a great beginner camera. I got one for my 14th birthday last year, and i love it. It is very beginner friendly. get this camera you will love it.|`|ayWyLLOMaa	I have a Nikon in the series above the camera that you have, and it is an awesome camera with features that I do not even know how to use yet. Like you, I too am a beginning photographer. Because my camera has way too many features, I would say that your Nikon D40 is a great camera for someone who is just starting off and wants to get some experience on a easy-to-use device. This most assuredly the camera that you want to start off with.|`|i5OVORXgaa	The Nikon D40 is great for a beginner.|`|xG5ZlJDqaa	Yes it is. It goes to waste in the hands of beginners.|`|NEFaTFHRaa	The D40 is great for all levels of users, not just beginners.  I've actually got the model just above the D40, and regret not getting the D40 instead.  <br>  <br>  The D40 is lightweight, quality built, a fast speed light sync speed, and great colors.  It's also got great support in the area of lenses. The kit lens (18-55mm) is great for beginners, but the beauty of the D40 is that you can use many upper level lenses that will compete with the D60, D90, D300. Maybe not in technical quality, but picture quality...that all depends on the user.  <br>  <br>  Some suggested lenses down the road to really up your picture taking potential...<br>  <br>  Nikon 18-200mm f3.5 VR<br>  Nikon 35mm f1.8 G (just came out)<br>  Tokina 10-14mm f2.8<br>  <br>  <br>  Lenses are more important than the camera body. I could take a D40 out any day of the week and compete against D700 users. It just takes skill and patience.
FCAXTGXRaa	well...u can simply download games from www.ideasmobile.net and burn them on dual layer cd and they will work for sure..|`|q6uyloYdaa	Well, it's not illegal, but installing games on your 360 hard drive doesn't mean you're copying it. Even if you put it on your hard drive you still need the disc to play, so your friends won't really be getting the game for free from you. They'll need the disc anyway.|`|4KsCvgfpaa	download games from the marketplace,  give yoour friends your gamertag and password so they can sign in to your name and the downloaded games can download onto their hard drive and vise versa|`|HuQVHaIgaa	NNNOOOO Hahaha|`|pBAsLOfqaa	won't work <br>  i've tried.|`|ozM1rX7Iaa	Not really. The game won't work anyway unless you have a disc. Installing will only reduce load times and noise.|`|UWJinEbIaa	Won't work you need the physical disc in the drive in order for it to play.  Installing the game to the HDD is convenient but its only use is to prevent disc drive noise.<br>  <br>  You can't bypass the copy protection....if you do M$ will find out and ban your LIVE account.|`|VJ1C5JsYaa	Like said before its not illegal but it was already thought of and they have already set it so people like you cant do that. It is required to have the disc in the console tray before you are able to play it. The reason for installing to the HD is not so you dont need a disc it is so the system does not get as hot and also it is not as loud when playing. Nice try. Also no burning it would not work either. As you dont know what your doing I will simply tell you there is something called a stealth patch on all the game disc it is an imbeded code in the game that will not copy and the game will not run without it. THE ONLY WAY TO PLAY A GAME IS TO HAVE IT. Unless you flash your Xbox which I am not going to get into. Plus if you have Xbox Live you would be banned in a min for doing that.<br>  <br>  Edit: noviheat22 is also wrong not that it makes much difference. Since the only game on the marketplace are not 360 games. Also any time they would want to play them they would have to sign in with your account (normally). Just like I have downloaded all the halo 3 maps but if I take my HD off and put it on a friends console and dont sign in I cant use the maps.|`|c1sRWiX3aa	Off topic, but trying to keep you from having 'issues'....what noviheat22 said won't work, either. When you download the games from Live there is a 'key' (for lack of a better word) that is associated with your 360s serial number. So whichever 360 downloads the game off of Live with your gamertag becomes the 'owner' of the game.<br>  <br>  I speak from experience. Before I had the internet I took my hard drive (and just the hard drive) to my buddies to download several games. The 'games' themselves were on my hard drive (as well as his 360 somehow), but the 'key' to play them offline was attached to his 360. We had to do a 'license transfer' to get it all straightened out.<br>  <br>  Just figured you needed to know.|`|6GIrW5eWaa	problem is that you can't do it like that. once you install on the hard drive you still have to have the disk so. You can try but it won't work. Good Luck|`|wIM3vNtwaa	It isn't going to work anyway, because the 360 is just going to ask for the disc each time they want to play it.<br>  <br>  Microsoft thought off these things
seLkY8VZaa	You might try contacting the actual manufacturer of the laptop. Or find a Circuit City that might still be selling off it's stock and see what they say. But, they're under no obligation to give you your money back. That's one of the nasty little truths about retail store returns. There is no law (You'd be surprised how many people think there is) that says such and such a store has to give money or refunds of any kind.

RxB0ivXoaa	The D40 and D60 are both old technology and will not auto focus without expensive AF lenses. Nikon also puts the image stabilization in the lenses, meaning you need even more expense lenses to add that feature. In my opinion, Nikon and Canon are over priced. You pay more for a name without any added quality. You can look at DSLRs from companies like Olympus, Pentax, Sigma, Panasonic, Sony and find a better value while still getting high quality images. Don't be misled, there are professionals that buy from these companies and more. Check out dpreview.com for reviews and to see comparisons of sample pictures.|`|qIR9DB9Haa	Not to mention mega pixels is about 1% if any percent at all of why you would get a DSLR vs a point and shoot.

pZGLhV2Waa	If you want grain you have two options. You can use a film camera with a high ISO film like 800. If you are using digital you can use a high ISO. There are also programs that will recreate the look of various films.|`|i5OVORXgaa	I'm not sure which picture you're talking about... but if you want grain, use a high ISO! The best camera would be any camera that allows you to control the ISO... advanced point and shoots, DSLR, even 35mm with high ISO film.|`|tWoN22rRaa	As the article suggests, these were taken with a film camera. The grain is a natural effect with the medium... especially with more light sensitive/higher ASA films.<br>  <br>  The "noise" that digital cameras produce at high sensitivity is often referred to as "grain", but it has a very different (and arguably less pleasing) look.<br>  <br>  If you have Photoshop, or similar photo editing program, there are filters that can simulate the grainy look.
LXiBCERZaa	Dead rising deals with the slow zombie genre, left4dead deals with the fast zombie genre, so really they are both worth picking up as both are pretty fun. You'll get more game play out of dead rising, and I personally think it's a bit more fun, however it's also a lot more involved (left4dead you just run and shoot). <br>  <br>  If you want to just go out and kill endless hordes at a fast pace pick up left4dead. It's a lot more fun online then it is in single player.<br>  <br>  If you want more involved game play go for dead rising, and it's only single player, no online. Plus you can kill zombies with a lawn mower. I mean come on, that's awesome.<br>  <br>  You kill lots of zombies in both, so don't worry about that.|`|ZIciIWHTaa	dead rising is sweet yuo can carry over your level to your next game and theres 2 campaigns 72 hour mode and infinity mode. left 4 dead is fun at first it has 4 episodes/campaigns which takes like a hour for each one and online is not that fun if your a zombie you die in like 3 shots. left 4 dead gets really boring really fast. dead rising will keep you entertained for a month bad thing is there is no online. also you can unlock megaman stuff to use in dead rising.|`|3F1jDFtyaa	hey. even thought i have a ps3, ive played dead rising round my mates house. I love it and i thought it was brilliant. There's almost unlimited options and you can play for hours. If there's one game that i wish could be on a ps3, it would be this. If u haven't got it...try to get it....i promise you will  love it. It's Amazing!!!!!!!!!!|`|cdf9bde60acfd0a622e4bbdccdc9e515aa	it's a great game! so much fun and so many options. basically any object in the game can be used as a weapon, and you get to take pictures of zombies and run around almost limitlessly. i love dead rising.|`|IRTsTnpqaa	It is for a few days then gets really boring.I would rent it but not buy it|`|XwXNNp8Raa	Its a good rental as someone said.  Its insanely fun at first, but then I find it gets tedious.  Good game though.|`|5frOVAgSaa	i have not played dead rising but i have played left 4 dead and all i can say is that this game is fun only for a couple of weeks (or a month at max). the gameplay gets repetitive and ultimately boring. if u really want to play the game, just rent it for a week.
N4BFdAdJaa	My old shuffle did that once. I ended up having to restore it and then load everything back on it again. If that doesn't work, then I would contact Apple if it is still under warranty and they will be able to help. Just restoring it helped me.
6GIrW5eWaa	the tracking number they gave you isn't really for the coffin that you are expecting. It is for the prepaid shipping label once you ship the system back to xbox. Good luck|`|rxi2f0FIaa	They probably gave you the wrong tracking number or your mistaken. A tracking number is a long series of numbers, as long as a credit card number sometimes. But Try again usually 7-12 digits long
RpCwfcRzaa	You can't get on Live without updating. There was a program where Microsoft offered used 20 GB hard drives to Arcade owners for $20, but I don't think they're offering it anymore. You can buy a used drive at Gamestop or a 512 MB memory card for pretty cheap.
JO8FKDRhaa	there are more accessories built for ipod, ipod usually costs less, but zune has an FM radio. you should go to best buy and try them both out and see which one you like more. its a preference issue really|`|3Zm9vDw1aa	there both great the zune has a bigger screen but it doesnt have a click wheel like the ipod <br>  the ipod has more gigabits now and has better ratings than any other mp3 player.<br>  i would chose the ipod
AIHdpZNUaa	Oh thats air support (Tactician badge) you can't fly it. Or are you talking about the A-TAC thing, in singleplayer, and thats also a no...|`|4gyrvY7Jaa	You can't, sorry. You can only call it to attack! BTW: If you have Killzone 2 add me on PSN (Takoulya)!|`|c4EoSmi0aa	its a badge for engineer i pretty sure ability to call in air support
5VQrGtIIaa	Yes and no.  If it is just a head (amp only), then yes as long as you connect it to a full range cabinet.  If it is a combo amp with a speaker than no.  The reason is the speaker is not full range and it will sound horrible.  Also keep in mind a lot of bass amps do not have reverb or distortion so you will at least need pedals.
i3PGjRRfaa	Expect about $400 for it.................|`|spjDVZgzaa	about $50|`|h66gC4xMaa	Id say no more than $150 american. Especially because the void seal is broken.

I already have a cell phone that i pay for so i didn't need the phone. <br>  <br>  anyway, you can download applications, play games, learn new things. you can also jailbreak your ipod touch so you can accept third party applications such as nes, snes, sega, and playstation emulators. <br>  <br>  on youtube you can see plenty of what the itouch can do. It can surf the web as long as there is a wifi signal present. also, there's an application that allows wifi service anywhere. check the itunes store for it. <br>  <br>  this is on the down low but, my friend actually used his ipod touch and made a phone call. to do this properly first you need earphones that have a built in mic wifi signal and an account with voip.com<br>  <br>  music, movies, photos, applications and internet when available make the ipod touch a powerhouse.|`|wm1RTEe2aa	Yes you can but i would recommend getting <br>  the iPhone to just have a phone with all of those <br>  features but that's just my<br>   opinion the things you can do on an ipod are <br>  as follows but is not limited to:<br>  music, <br>  videos, <br>  photos,<br>   podcasts, <br>  e-mail, <br>  Web browsing, <br>  Internet radio, <br>  games, <br>  Nike+, <br>  Wi-Fi music downloads, <br>  and an App Store for adding thousands of custom features.|`|kYPiU1BJaa	Yes u can.

AA11789493	You have to determine what kind of media software your Zune needs and what players are compatible with the sites that sells songs.  Once you've determined that--you can look at the documentation that came with your Zune or the Zune web site--you can "burn" songs from CDs that you or your friends have. I buy tracks from Napster and it lists the players it's compatible with.  I've only used my computer, which has Windows and Windows Media player, to get the tracks and then download them to an MP3 player.

iTBqOwxtaa	The theory behind a better speaker wire relates to the fact that higher frequencies (above 5000 Hz) travel on the periphery and not in the core of the wire. <br>  So the effective cross-sectional area is lower and there will be a signal drop.<br>  So, more than just increase the wire size, it's better to increase the number of strands. <br>  Of course increasing both is best. How much to increase? It depends on the length. <br>  You may have heard about Monster cables or other high quality brands. They all use larger number of strands than you'll find on regular electrical cables.<br>  Would you notice a significant difference? Probably not.<br>  <br>  Added: The effect of higher frequencies traveling on the periphery is called "Skin Effect".<br>  Although it's highly theoretical, you can read about this here:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_effect" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_effect</a>|`|p1dcw35Qaa	You can but your better off with a good quality polarized (distinguished + and - on the wire) speaker wire. I would suggest 16 or 14 gauge for most installations and there's no need to buy expensive Monster (or other name brand) wire. You will want to make sure you have the plus to the plus on the speakers (correct polarity). Home Depot actually has decent 16 gauge speaker wire for a reasonable price.|`|54048f431e23af198481432570ea86bcaa	Look at <a href="http://www.audioasylum.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.audioasylum.com</a><br>  <br>  Click on "cables" and do a search on "speaker" <br>  <br>  You will find more info than you can digest. If you are looking to upgrade the sound of your system using cables, replace the cheap power cords first.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	I used insulated speaker cable to connect my 5.1 setup.  However, when I got speaker stands for Christmas I needed thinner wire, so I bought regular electric wiring (aka "lamp cord") by the foot at Lowe's.  I can tell no difference, but I do check regularly for corrosion.<br>  <br>  Here's some must-read info on speaker cables: <a href="http://www.roger-russell.com/wire/wire.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.roger-russell.com/wire/wire.h...</a>|`|AA10594501	As far as speaker performance goes, all that matters is the wire gauge thickness.

The Paint program is located in the Start directory of Windows in the "Accessories". In that program there is a "paint brush" or "pencil" "or "paint spray" functions. After you select one of these options a little squirt appears instead of the mouse on the photo, you should aim the squirt on the picture spot you wish to duplicate and then the squirt will change back to your selection of paint applier, then gently use the left mouse click to spray your selection over the undesired part.

AA10492776	Sony's rear projection TVs have had serious technical problems with their optical blocks. As these blocks age, they produce color streaks along the edges of the screen or colored blobs in the center of the screen. The many class action law suite settlements Sony has enetered may entitle you to a free replacement of the optical block through June 2010. Check your model here: <a href="http://esupport.sony.com/?ref=http%3A//w..." rel="nofollow">http://esupport.sony.com/?ref=http%3A//w...</a><br>  <br>  The bad news: There is NO long term solution to this problem. The replacement optical blocks will temporarily fix the problem, but 2-3 years down the road you will have the same problem again. Consider purchasing a new TV for a permanent fix.|`|iFRvRy2Raa	It sounds like you have an Optic Block that needs to be replaced.

Sj20BOlZaa	both have very good quality's. but it comes down to what your going to be using it for.<br>  <br>  PS3 - the blu ray player on this console makes it ideal for hi def movies, but it is generally accepted amongst the gaming community that their is a lack of good games for the PS3. price wise the PS3 is probably cheaper overall if you are going to play online as it is free.<br>  <br>  Xbox 360 - because of the HD DVD downfall last year microsoft have decommissioned the HD DVD player which can no longer be bought as an add on for the 360, so movie wise its lacking. because of it being out longer the 360 has A lot more games than th PS3 which means that the average number of good games is likely to be higher, and with games like dead rising 2 coming out next year and a possibility of Gears of war 3 the 360 completely tops the PS3 on games. price-wise its more expensive being that you have to pay for xbox live to play online.<br>  <br>  Since its a games console that you are going to be buying i suggest you go for the xbox 360 purely for its vast amount of amazing games with re-playability.

2btGvJexaa	Unfortunately the ATT Go Phone Cards only work with Go Phones. The Cards themselves are just going to add money into someones prepaid account. ATT offers two plans for Go phone customers, they either pay $1 a day on the days they use the phone and then calls are only 10 cents a minute or they are paying a flat rate of 25 cents a minute. Regardless of whichever plan they are on the cards you have will just add the money into their account. It will say on the card how much the dollar amount it is worth, your prob not gonna get that full value for the card so your gonna want to sell it a little bit cheaper. Also when you sell them make sure you show people that the pin code on the back of the card is not scratched out so they know your not lieing. It will show your an honest seller. :]|`|ni7UqGQVaa	<a href="http://inthisget.pablocostas.com.ar" rel="nofollow">http://inthisget.pablocostas.com.ar</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay a minute in website and enter you email address for getting your answer.

Once the sticker is removed, MS is going to assume that you tried to fix it yourself or did something to the 360, so MS is not going to attempt to fix it.

RMmh0aimaa	LCD is the best but be sure that it is a newer model. The cheap ones you see are most likely the first range which came out. They have a slow response rate which make the image blur across the screen in high speed images such as car racing.<br>  <br>  Also look for a high contrast ratio eg 50,000:1 - This will give a better difference in visibility levels between black and white - ie you will see greater detail in the picture.<br>  <br>  Look for a HDTV with 1080 resolution for a detailed picture.<br>  <br>  Plasma TV's were better than the old LCD TV's but the new LCD's are better than Plasma offering better contrast, resolution and reliability.<br>  <br>  For LCD TV's look at the warranties the different manufacturers offer. When an LCD goes faulty the pixels start dying out. The better manufacturers will offer replacement TV when a certain number of pixels die out (eg 20 pixels).

O8qdCBzLaa	Have you ever had the VCR serviced? It could be that the heads are out of alignment or dirty. Also, the playback tracking could be off. If you have a manual tracking control, try adjusting that. If it's automatic, you're at its mercy.<br>  <br>  One other thing to check is the connection to the TV from the VCR. The VCR puts out analog TV channel 3 as its output. If the connections are loose, it's a push-on type of connector, or the cable is poorly constructed, stray RF signals in the air can leak onto the cable and interfere with the signal from the VCR.<br>  <br>  A good, quick go/no-go test is to simply swap out the VCRs and see if the problem is with the suspect VCR or the TV (if the suspect VCR looks like crap on the other TV, it's the VCR).|`|AA11141136	Do you have an RF connection for  VCR/TV? It could be that the UHF channel you are using for the VCR is too close to another channel in use.

Ar27UBs3aa	HTC AT&T Fuze is basically an HTC Touch Diamond Pro with a new 5 row, slide-out QWERTY keyboard. It comes equipped with high end features like a 2.8" VGA touchscreen display, HSDPA/HSUPA high-speed data, and a 3.2 megapixel AF-capable camera. The HTC AT&T Fuze sports HTC's shiny new TouchFLO 3D user interface extensions and home screen. TouchFLO 3D provides users with a high-gloss 3D animated user expereincethat is backed up with across the board tweaks to make regular applications more finger friendly, so that the HTC AT&T Fuze should be easily usable with either one hand or two. The HTC AT&T Fuze runs version 6.1 of Microsoft's Windows Mobile Professional operating system, and comes equipped with over 256MB of application RAM and a respectable 512MB of internal flash storage space. A SD 2.0 compatible microSD card slot means that users can add even more storage capacity with 8GB or, in the future, 16GB microSD cards. other features of note on the HTC AT&T Fuze include GPS and WiFi support. The HTC AT&T Fuze's 1350mAh battery should provide users with up to 8 hours of talk time or 2 weeks of standby time when used on GSM networks.<br>  <br>  It is available online too i have seen it on SN Traders|`|4cMuedpWaa	Let's begin considering that there is NO such thing like a Diamond Pro...<br>  <br>  Now, HTC Fuze and HTC Pro basically have the same features except:<br>  <br>  The Fuze is a quad band HSDPA 850 / 900 / 1900 / 2100 where the Pro (european version) is only dual band HSDPA 900 / 2100.<br>  <br>  The Fuze does NOT have a front facing camera where the Pro (european version) sports a secondary videocamera for videocalls.<br>  <br>  Lots of places where you can find it, all sell it unlocked:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.omegacell.com/product.php?productid=353&cat=0&page=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.omegacell.com/product.php?pro...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.markways.com/detail/917/HTC_Touch_Pro_Fuze/" rel="nofollow">http://www.markways.com/detail/917/HTC_T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.puremobile.ca/HTC/HTC-FUZE-Black-AT&T/" rel="nofollow">http://www.puremobile.ca/HTC/HTC-FUZE-Bl...</a>

qMQeHVOhaa	Downloading cracked apps is ILLEGAL! If you want the apps buy the lite version, and if you like it, upgrade to the full version.
pl6eDKQbaa	The advantage on the 16gb is that in the future when you get more music and videos, and Apps which you will end up wanting to put on there.<br>  <br>  Music - 1000 songs is about the equivalent of 4gb. So if you get a 8gb you already have used 1/2 your space.<br>  Movies - Movies generally take up around 100 for a 5-10 video. So if you had about 20 short videos (not many in reality) you have another 2 gigs down. That leaves you 2 gigs for extra songs movies and apps...<br>  Apps are generally smaller but they do add up very quickly.<br>  Defiantly go the 16 gig, it will leave you a lot of extra room for more things in the future. Secondly I have noticed the extra weight in the memory of the 16 gig does seem to add a bit of solidity to the unit meaning it'll probably last a bit longer too.<br>  Either way your getting an awesome unit. Have fun.|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	Go for the 16GB.|`|PppQI2Uwaa	32GB FOR SURE THEN MOD THE ITOUCH FOR FREE GAMES apps and FREE movies<br>  ~to get free thing see mininova.org<br>  your welcome|`|55f40ce05972303abf2ecdf6f5118432aa	Well, if money is no issue than get the biggest size memory you can find.  You think you won't want movies or anything like that now and maybe you won't but remember when you thought you would never use 1 GB of hard drive on your PC?  Now look at how much you use!  There will be 100GB+ ipods before you know it.  So, like I said if you can afford it, get the 32GB if you can find it, but you would probably fine with the 16 if you're only wanting music.  I think 8 is a litte too small.  You can alss keep some pics on it.<br>  <br>  By they way, I have a 16 and I usually rotate movies I want to watch. It is enough for me, but my decision was based on a ballance of cost (just wanted to be responsible with my $) and my desire to get the biggest one just because it was there.|`|JO8FKDRhaa	ewll if money isnt your concern, you shoudl deifnatley go bigger. what could it hurt? my father bought the 16 and he only has 1200 songs on it so he could have bought the 8 easily. but he figured hell for 70 bucks more? get the 16. i myself bought the 32 gb, i've got 8000 songs on it and apps up the wazoo! lol|`|HAWwbpjraa	if u want to make sure you have enough space, id go with the 16gb. its right in between big and small so it should be fine. :)|`|WKzHVRHWaa	if moneys not a prob get the biggest one|`|98OlWbtXaa	I got the 16gb iPhone over the 8gb, and I am SO glad I did!

Plus photos look so cool on there, you will want some on it.<br>  <br>  I have a regular iPod nano, 8gb, and it got full really quickly on just music; I was disappointed.  Now I put only videos on it and use my iPhone for videos, songs, apps and  photos.  <br>  <br>  Plus the software takes up some of the space, so you will get less than 8 to start off with.<br>  <br>  The memory is also non-upgradable.  So if you think you might run out, get the bigger one!|`|qfe5GOcMaa	8gb if their is a 100 dollar difference between them it is not worth it. *gb should be ideal for you, i can put a crap load of songs, rent movies and that stuff, but i deff don't have 1k songs, but if you are positive you are going to have 1k songs then u can get the 16. up to you, if the price is a big diff go with the 8|`|ejGB0Thfaa	I would prefer the 16 GB.<br>  <br>  The 8 GB is probably not enough memory.<br>  <br>  I bet some people can answer this question but seriously who is going to use 32GB?

QEw0eILQaa	yes. go onto youtube and search lg versa review and you will find people showing how it looks and works (my favorite video is from phonedog) <br>  <br>  lg versa is a complete touch screen with a send end and clear key. it has an acceleromitor so you can go from portrait mode or landskape mode. that is usefull for typing on screen. you can type on screen holding it upright and you will get 3 letters per number key or rotate it and get full qwerty keyboard. if you take of the back of it you can attach the keyboard/case. if you close the case attached to the phone it has send and end key on it and a small screen displaying time and date. the attachable keypad has very nice easy push buttons and T arrow keys(good for editing mistakes in a txt message). i think it is a great phone. but i think before you buy it you should look into it a little bit more and see if it is what would be good for you. such as camera, email, messaging, music, good calender - those feateres you should read about and see which ones work best and which ones you would want very good.<br>  <br>  In case you are wondering it works on verizon wireless network. if you are not extremely pleased with most aspects of the phone dont get it because there are allot of good phones coming out soon (meaning next few months)<br>  <br>  you can also gooogle it to find some photose cause it may turn you like it.<br>  <br>  i personally like how the keyboard is attachable because with me after a few months i get bored with layout of my phone and i think it would be cool to be able to practically have a new phone everytime you either take the attachable keyboard on or off.<br>  <br>  pros and cons (some comparison to the lg dare)<br>  <br>  pros-<br>  it is like the dare but you can have 3 homescreen windows by flicking the screen and if you have the keyboard attached you can have 4<br>  it is even more customizable than the dare<br>  lg took some of the problems from the dare and fixed them<br>  the screen is super responsive<br>  you can txt on screen or attach the keypad<br>  it has visual voicemail which is really nice (that means that you can see what number called you what time and you can play and go to a certain point in the message easily)<br>  webbrowsing has basic flash so unlike most phone webbrowsers it can display what the website looks like on a computer and not just the phone version<br>  if there is a youtube video embed in a website it can play it unlike all other phones (and it wont open in a seperate window)<br>  <br>  cons-<br>  (i am not sure how many i can think of lol)<br>  not all websites using flash work perfectly but you tube and other simple ones do)<br>  you may think when the keypad is attached it is bulky (which i dont think so but everyone has their own opinion)<br>  cant think of any more things wrong with the phone !!!!!<br>  <br>  so basically i think the lg versa is practically the best verizon phone so far. you can always wait a month or two more because i am sure allot of other phones will be coming out. you should go onto youtube and search lg versa and you can watch some video reviews about the device. that would probably help you make your decision.

fBe2cD42aa	id say make sure that your ipod is set to sync with your entire library...if its only set to certain playlists then you may not be including the one with the songs in it.<br>  <br>  another possible solution would be to put the ipod in the manually manage music setting, you can find this option as a check box on the screen that appears when you connect the ipod.  once you do this then just drag all of the music or playlists onto your ipod and then they will sync automatically<br>  <br>  good luck|`|6PwhYOhIaa	When you plug in you iPod, and it goes to the page with th iPod and how full it is, press the Restore button and maybe get the software update.

QlsuoUb4aa	does your mp3 player connect to your computer through usb connectivity?<br>  <br>  and when you disconnect it, do you jus pull it out or do you eject the removable disk from the computer first and THEN disconnect it?<br>  <br>  if you don't eject the disk first, it can ruin the contents of your mp3 player which is why now it needs to be reformatted. you can try it again. but if it keeps saying you need to reformat it, you should do it.

Insert it in your camera and format it once more in your camera itself.<br>  <br>  In future, do not delete photos on your camera. Do it through your computer. Before every shooting session, use a newly formatted memory card. Keep your memory card away from other electronic equipments. In airports- let your card go through x-rays (in your luggage) rather than through metal detectors (with you).|`|i5OVORXgaa	Try reformatting it... if it doesn't work then you're pretty much out of luck.|`|lrJopeC5aa	no i think you have to delete it

Not all of Zune to all of iPod.<br>  <br>  If you dont like that link, this is what I would suggest:<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Since I've got an iPod, I'm sticking with the iPod. I don't want to have to buy all my music again, give up smart playlists, and basically learn to use both a new player and the corresponding software.<br>  Say you're not using the iPod, or are ready to try something different. <br>  <br>  Now, you've got a lot more options...<br>  <br>  You really like the music/picture sharing: Zune. It's a feature not found on the iPod, but will have limited use unless your friends all buy Zunes. Chicken & Egg problem, where you don't want to buy one until other people have it, which means it'll take a while to get up to speed.<br>  <br>  You want a bigger screen: Zune.<br>  <br>  You need an all-you-can-eat subscription service: Zune.<br>  <br>  You want a store with a larger music library: iPod.<br>  <br>  You want a movie and TV store: iPod.<br>  <br>  You want contacts, calendar, notes, stopwatch, and iPod Games: iPod.<br>  <br>  You want to be different/want something new: Zune.<br>  <br>  Xbox 360 owners who purchase music and want streaming: Zune.<br>  <br>  Xbox 360 owners who purchase music and don't want streaming: iPod.<br>  <br>  You want a scratch resistant player: Zune.<br>  <br>  You want a built-in FM tuner: Zune.<br>  <br>  You want a touch-sensitive scroll wheel: iPod.<br>  <br>  For most people, we're going to recommend you get an iPod. It's got more support, plus it's backed by iTunes, which works well and gives you a lot more choice in music, TV, and movie purchases.<br>  <br>  Of course if you want a subscription service, or a bigger screen, or a built-in FM tuner, then there's the Zune. But if you're borderline between the Zune and the iPod, we'd play it safe and get the iPod, then wait for the 2nd generation Zune and see what's going on.|`|BgwTxzEFaa	Who owns a Zune?<br>  <br>  That 14.99 with the zune lets you rent the songs and such.

I owned a zune for exactly 1 year and 19 days. During that time span my zune broke twice. The date that i bought it was February 15 2008. From the very first day i got it, it was a little glitcthy, like it froze up when i changed the song. Then one day in September it completly froze and it would not unfreeze. I sent it in and they replaced it. When i got it back it still froze a little bit, but it was working. Then on March 6 2009, the center button quite working. I called up microsoft to see what they would do because the warrenty had just expired about four weeks before it broke. They said they could do nothing. So the very next day i went out and bought and ipod touch and i love it. It has way more features than the zune and it does not glitch and there are many more accesories you can buy for it. You can get on the enternet with it and i just love it. I will never be buying a zune again.

Sure it looks like a cool gadget, but it's no good if it drops your call when you make a U-turn under a highway bridge.  Consider this, in 6 months, that phone you're looking at is obsolete.

That is not a smart way of buying a phone.<br>  If you want an answer that is based off your needs, then you need to tell us which features are most important in the phone, and we can then point you in the direction of which phone meets those needs.<br>  If you dont tell us what you need, then every phone we recommend will suit our needs, not yours.|`|vKG6qO2Zaa	iphone is way better!!!!!!!!
UphoLYGYaa	Any bluetooth headset will work fine with the PS3, so pick one that you can afford and fits you comfortably. I used to use a Motorola H700 till it broke, so I got the official one just because i had a few dollars to burn.  I am happy with it, but in this economy you should save what you can, and a cheaper bluetooth works just as well.|`|b7xKoYqBaa	You should be able to use any bluetooth headset. I know people who use one for both their daily cell phone use and also for gaming. They almost never take it off! It should work and any problems you have I have found that the PS3 forums on the Sony website are surprisingly helpful and receptive. <br>  <br>  P.S. I have the PS3 one and it is much better than people have reviewed online. Very comfortable!|`|QVNVAH7Qaa	You can use any bluetooth headset. I suggest the Plantronics brand.

UinOWcMUaa	Actually everyone who posted an answer is wrong. It has nothing to do with the 1080p signal, but it has to do with the 120Hertz refresh rating that they normally have the TV's hooked up too !! Usually, most of our TVs at home are only 60Hertz as opposed to Best Buy !!! The refresh makes it look more clearer and life like quality !!|`|XLHrIFA4aa	Is it running 1080p? Or 1080i? p is what they use in stores and is higher quality. i is essentially just a slightly better version of 720p, so there's definitely a difference.|`|AA12290212	Because they have highest pixel resolution on their tvs, 1080X1920! (or 1940 i cant remember) If your tv is not he highest pixel resolution then the picture loses quality!|`|ZWHZto1Baa	Because your Sony Wega is several years old, and would obviously not look as good as modern television sets.|`|as0G7rNDaa	because i am usually stoned when i go to best buy|`|MDhGURU4aa	Because they want you to buy them, so they make them look hell good, but actually they're not.

There should be an option that says SMS and E-mail Inboxes. Set it to Separate.<br>  <br>  This will give you a new icon on your home screen for SMS messages.

Instead, you'll need to enter it into one of the twenty channels in one of the ten memory banks. (There's your 200 channels.)  But once you have that frequency stored, you can select its channel directly for listening.<br>  <br>  So, if you have a frequency in mind, choose a bank number (0-9) and a channel number (0-19), then hit MAN, ENT/PGM, and punch in those numbers to go to that empty channel. Hit MAN again and enter the frequency including the decimal point and finish with ENT/PGM.<br>  <br>  To listen to that channel, hit MAN and enter the three digit number.
pl6eDKQbaa	Nope you're not doing anything wrong. I think it sounds like a connection problem with the ends of the USB or on the iPod. Perhaps try a new cable or just fiddle with how it sits in it. Otherwise its a problem with the internal wiring and can be fixed by an iPod repairer, or you could just get a new one, or just put up with it.
RMmh0aimaa	You need to take it to a repair shop.<br>  <br>  Most likely the power supply is being pulled down to ground by another faulty component within the TV. Most likely either one of the diodes on the secondary side of the power transformer are faulty, or perhaps one of the filter capacitors have dried out or blown up.<br>  <br>  It could also be the power supply itself in that the drive transistor has given up, but usually this would cause no light to flash on the power on mode. The flashing light shows that the power supply is trying to start up, but is being shut down again by a safety circuit.<br>  <br>  It could in fact be the safety circuit which is faulty which is often the case in these circumstances.|`|551b2184eb8b53e521be093fb04e526baa	Look in your user's manual in the Troubleshooting Tips and it will show you how to use the blinking LED as a troubleshooting guide.

According to the seller's description it is.|`|31420ed41c716cbb02addca8d450fc2eaa	You have to get a lens that is made for the 4:3 aspect ratio.  That one seems to be, but you can get a comparable lens, albeit a little shorter in zoom with the 40-150mm made by Olympus.  Check Olympus and Panasonic listing, those both use 4:3. Olympus makes their own lenses and Panasonic lenses are branded Leica.  Because Olympus lense elements are all glass and Sigma has plastic, I would use the Olympus lens before I would get the Sigma.  It is about the same cost, but better glass.

Don't waste time & money on a PSP. Also, I wouldn't bother with an iPod Touch unless getting an iPhone is not possible due to provider contractual obligations.<br>  <br>  Remember: The iPhone is exactly the iPod Touch with internet EVERYWHERE instead of just in WiFi spots + has phone capabilities (which include Visual Voicemail, where you see a list of your voicemails & can play them by touching one.

oEvHzaUPaa	I like Mark E's answer, but wanted to add a little something. Look for power ratings which are measured less than 1% thd (total harmonic distortion) and at the speaker's efficiency (higher is better, rated in db) use these small specs. and your ears to get what you like. Sound quality is very subjective. Specs. are good for information, but if it sounds like crap to you, they mean nothing.|`|1b408d552c3c135a0e5f4218c5cd6e80aa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_square#Amplifier_power_efficiency" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_mean_s...</a>|`|2sMA3HQCaa	The wattage rating for subwoofers is essentially the same as any other type of speaker. RMS stands for "root-mean-square", the mathematical basis for the power measurement. (You needn't be too concerned with that, other than to ignore other supposed methods: "peak" power, "peak-to-peak" power, "instantaneous peak" power, or any of a host of other units designed create inflated numbers!)<br>  <br>  The wattage rating generally indicates the power level the speaker can handle without damage. While a higher wattage rating usually does mean more sound output capability, this is not always the case; just because it can handle the power does not necessarily mean it's converting it into acoustical energy.

CQA4HAdmaa	The Nano has 16GB of memory that can never change because Apple has soldiered in memory when there is no reason to do so unless they expect to not be able to improve anything from that point further.  The Sansa has a larger screen than the Nano, plus FM radio and the ability to add flash memory in addition to having the same memo as an Apple-this is in addition to a superior firmware that rarely hangs up and requires resetting.<br>  <br>  The classic has a stronger memory that will allow future hard drive upgrades.  It also has a larger screen and can be used to transfer data from your computer to another drive.  You can also buy a recorder to use it to tape lectures or anything. <br>  <br>  Parts are also more plentiful in case your Classic needs repair.  The Classic is also built stronger. <br>  <br>  I hope that helps.  I personally like the 5.5 Gen 30GB iPods, then upgrading the hard drive and battery. I don't like coverflow on the ipod and think the split screen makes the iPod look cheaper-The Nano also has coverflow.  The older video ipods also sound better than the classic and there is no need to purchase special headphones.<br>  <br>  The Classic cost in terms the Nano is slightly higher, but the space is far greater.  When flash memory gets cheaper and larger, you will be able to replace the hard drive with it.  In terms of space and size, the classic fit in your shirt pocket and anywhere a Nano can.  <br>  <br>  A Classic can do anything a Nano can and more-will last you longer|`|ZOgcqaEIaa	Get a Zune...Apples are crap and require you to convert all your media to MP4.

I bought it with the game SOCOM Confrontation (which is also good) and I love it. It's really comfortable and the sound quality is great.

RLjEC8cZaa	Push the red buttton on the wii console while playing the game. That is the sync it will only give you 45 seconds to sync the wii board so right after you hit the red sync button then you hit the wii boards sync button and it will sync|`|Y4s4Om38aa	it sounds like you are trying to sync it while on the main menu.  That would disconect the remote as its trying to sync it as a remote.   You have to sync the fit board while in the game,  as it syncs to the game, not to the console as a remote.  This is why you have to sync the board with every game that uses the board, not just once to the system like the remotes<br>  <br>  So open the game that uses the fit board, then sync|`|5lUSWvXhaa	First of all you need to sync them at different times, the wii fit board have to be in range with the wii.

qvnrag48aa	Go for a psp because you can watch movies, play games, listen to music, see photos, use internet, listen to radio... the list goes on.<br>  That being said, you should probobly invest in a larger memory stick for your purposes (PSP uses Memory Stick Pro Duo's, which can be rather expensive). <br>  <br>  AND I would wait a little while if I were you since a new PSP series is coming out soon (PSP 3000 series, look into it)<br>  <br>  Plus, there are currently many games being developed for this system including Resitance: Retribution, Little Big Planet, Rock Band Unplugged, etc.<br>  <br>  GO PSP.|`|M0qbyACRaa	pay off your debt with it.

pC2jGRKraa	Snooper is a reputable speed camera alert/detecting device. It will work, but it will only work if you keep its speed camera database up to date, so it can tell you cameras in reference to your GPS location.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if its a radar detctor, but the old snooper detectors work within decent range, but these are totally illegal to be in your car (but not illegal to own), unlike the GPS system, which is totally legal.|`|AA10929465	Wouldn't it be easier just to obey the speed limit?  Tens of thousands of people every year are killed in the US by car wrecks.<br>  <br>  To answer your question though, it's rated one star out of five by users.  It looks like the company is a bunch of con artists.  It is NOT a detector.  It relies on a database and you have to pay for a subscription to update the database.

zpo6JQfraa	If you have all of your music on your computer, then just try restoring the iPod while it is in DFU mode. You WILL lose whatever you have on your iPod though. <br>  <br>  To enter DFU mode:<br>  1) Ensure your iPod is connected to your computer<br>  2) Enter DFU mode by holding the power and home buttons for 10 seconds, then let go of the power button, BUT CONTINUE HOLDING THE HOME BUTTON.<br>  3) Windows should recognize your iPod as a DFU device; when that happens, you can let go of the home button<br>  4) iTunes should recognize your iPod in Recovery Mode and tell you that you must restore it before it can be used.<br>  5) Simply click restore!<br>  <br>  Hope it helps.

It's hard to call because they're in another country, but I was told by a Moneygram rep that PayPal will insure fraudulent purchases up to $200.

tRNtFNHLaa	Cable internet is a common broadband service that transfers data over cable television lines.
v3ZBDjJdaa	Yes they have boxes that do that but are often limited in the signal out put if you are using encrypted material.  Below are a couple links  to converters.
v3ZBDjJdaa	First from what I can tell you are very limited on the Bose for A/V connections.  That is a disadvantage of the Bose multimedia setups.  Benefit is they are easier to setup and use for many people.  <br>  <br>  Setup instructions may vary based on actual equipment (The Samsung A650 is only the last part of the model usually starts LN46A650 or similar).<br>  <br>  Since the Bose is limited on connections run the Cable box and Blu-Ray player through the TV then the audio to the Bose system.  Use HDMI cables to connect the components as they offer better picture.  If that is not available then use Component cables.<br>  <br>  Video Connection:  As mentioned the Bose system does not support multiple HDMI connections.  So we will run the video from your components to the TV directly. <br>  1. Cable box HDMI (assuming your cable box has this) output to TV HDMI 1<br>  2. Blu-Ray HDMI output to TV HDMI 2<br>  <br>  Audio Connection.  <br>  1. Since HDMI cables carry both audio and video you will not need cables from Blu-Ray or Cable box to TV<br>  2. Connect the “Digital Audio Out (Optical)” from TV to back of Bose “Optical” jack. <br>  3. Bose manual recommends also connecting RCA (analog cables, red & white cables) incase the digital sound drops.  <br>  4. Connect the Red & White cable from TV’s “Audio Out” to the Bose “Aux” audio inputs.<br>  <br>  You will want to assign the optical output on your Bose to make it easier to setup.<br>  Assigning the optical input<br>  1. Press the System button on the remote <br>  2. Press the right arrow to scroll to the Media Center icon at the top of the menu <br>  3. Press the down arrow to scroll to "Optical Source" <br>  4. Press the right arrow, then the up or down arrow to select the input that is using the optical connection (TV, CBL-SAT, VCR or AUX) You will select “TV”I have attached link to Bose page with answers to common questions.  <br>  <br>  Couple Notes:<br>  When watching TV and you want to play sound through the Bose system you will need to select the correct audio input to hear the music.<br>  You will also need to select correct source (HDMI) on TV depending if you are watching cable or Blu-Ray.  To change sources just select Source in remote until you have want you want.|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	Why bother running digital audio?  The 321 isn't a surround sound system.  It's a 2-channel stereo system that *simulates* surround sound.  (It's also way over-priced.)  I am dead serious when I say that I recommend you sell it on eBay and start over, spending your money wisely on an actual surround sound system.<br>  <br>  But let's go with what you have.  Run HDMI from the cable and the Blu-ray player to the TV and then send your 2-channel audio out from the TV to the Blose system with stereo RCA or optical cables.
c3FBZvo6aa	When you say movies, do you mean DVD's or movie clips you download? If it's DVD's your computer might not be able to play DVD's and you would need to get a new CD/DVD drive. And if your computer can play DVD's but it just doesn't start playing when you put it in the computer then just make sure it's in Full Mode (hit ctrl 1 if it's not) and press "Play" on the toolbar and click on CD/DVD or Audio.<br>  <br>  If it has nothing to do with DVD's but rather movie clips you've downloaded it could be that you don't have the correct codec to play the file. A lot of times when it's a codec issue it will say something you might not recognize in the name of the file. An example would be if it says "Surf Ninjas.DVDRip.XviD-PePPage.avi" the XviD portion is how you know it's not a normal file that WMP will recognize. If it's something along those lines you can usually just google the codec for the file type and download and install it for free. That's the only sort of file trouble I've ever had with WMP.<br>  <br>  Another potential problem would be that it's a ".mp4" or ".flv" which can't be played in WMP, and which you can only tell if you have the full file extensions on. start>control panel>folder options>view, then uncheck "hide extensions for known file types".|`|n3fGgrnuaa	Sorry my friend, we might need some more information.<br>  <br>  What types of files don't work?<br>  <br>  I just went through a month that my WMP didn't work either.<br>  <br>  Something to try:<br>  Change your user to Guest or create a new user and try it there.  Make sure you move your movie file to your c: drive instead of in your My Documents folder so you can find it using a Guest account.<br>  <br>  Mine worked as another user and that led me to believe that there was something that I downloaded or installed that was mixing it up.<br>  <br>  If you reinstall Windows it will definitely fix it!<br>  If you reinstall Windows you'll need to reinstall all of your programs and have backups of all your files BEFORE!  It will wipe out some or all of what you have on your hard drive so make sure you have a back  up.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|c4sn6g3xaa	I think you need "QuickTime".

4G41Z3RJaa	When that happens I call the operator and tell them that I am trying to make a call to a number that I know is in service but I am not allowed to complete the call.  The operator should make the call and if it goes through then they will issue a trouble report to your local Telco.  It is possible that some of the routing tables in the local Telco switch are not working the way that they should, the report will allow them to check the routing tables and correct the error.  There are other possibilities, the first thing that I would do is to make sure that it is not a number that you dial so often that you are double pressing a digit, or pressing a digit once when it should be twice.  So try once slowly, if it still does not work, then mark down all of the different digits in the telephone number that you are calling.  Make calls to enough telephone numbers so that you have dialed all of the digits in that cell number.  You need to do this to make sure that all of the digits on your phone work properly.  One last test, call the cell from another land line, if your land line number is 123-456-7890, them try to make the call from a number that has different digits than 456.  If that call goes through then definitely you should call 611.  If you cannot make a call from the other number either, then contact the Telco business office and ask why you cannot make a call from your home land line to the cell.  There may be a restriction to that cell service provider.
