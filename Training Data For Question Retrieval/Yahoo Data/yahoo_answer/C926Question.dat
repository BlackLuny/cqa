20090310023954AAMnPAp	Business & Finance;Investing	Stocks what you think?	Ok, I'm looking @ buying some stocks. I'm looking at AIG (American International Group), FRE(freddie mac), FNM (fannie Mae), and C (citigroup) I'm young,I think.. I'm 22 yrs old and  I can wait for all the stocks to mature. Question being.. If I purchase at .22 cents (let's just pretend). 20 yrs down the line it raises to $60.00 (just pretending). I sell all my 500 shares.. 500 x $60 = $30,000.00..  MY friend said since they govt own part of the above company, i would get less. Is this true? Like he said Citigroup, the govt s thinking of buying 35% off it's shares. When I sell, Citigroup @ 35.00, the government get 35% off what I sold it for..      Sold C: 500 stocks x $35.00(sold for) = $17,500.00      $17,500.00 x .35 (govt. owns) = $6,125.00 (govt takes from me)            is this true? If the govt. owns 35% they own 35%. They shouldn't be taking money from me since they own 35% off the share.          can someone clarify this for me? Thank You.

20090309120441AAvfLFw	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	I'm renting an apartment.  My name is on the lease, but my roommate wants me out.  What are my rights?	we both signed the lease. I dont want to move all my stuff out and live somewhere unfamiliar.       I was thinking of leaving my stuff in the apartment and moving out temporarily and if things work out in the other state, I will come back and move all my stuff there. Can he legally force me out of the apartment?      Hes trying to sublease the apartment, but he doesnt have my permission to do so. Can he sitll rent my daughter's room out?      How can I protect my items while im gone?      He wants me out because he doesn't have the time to be with us anymore and wants to concentrate on his "career". In reality, he's just spending most of his days playing card games. Things didn't work out for us because my daughter started calling him daddy. He insist that his decision isn't because of her, but I'm sure it's about being a responsible b/f. (we've been together three years and just moved in together 6 months ago)    His excuse is that he had no ideal that living with us would be so time consuming. He's shocked that now he doesn't have the time to spend playing cards because he comes home to a woman and a child.      I don't really want to move because my family just moved across the country and my job is here. I would have to sell my car in the next three weeks, leave my job, send all my stuff (by myself, because I don't have the money to hire movers). It's a huge hassel and sacrifice.   I really can't stand this guy anymore, but I don't want to end up homeless with my daughter. She is more important than him, so I am trying to figure out what my options are.  The family member that wants to takes us in, isn't really willing and keeps telling me to try to work things out.  He doesn't want to work things out. He just wants us out. I don't know what to do.       Help, it's urgent.      He said, that if i don't leave then he will and not pay rent. I'm worried about being stuck with the bill.

I don't want to sound lazy - it's just that I have a one year old son and it would be hard to move all the furniture out to paint and replace flooring - and we have no one we can stay with.

I went to this shoe shop last year and the man there started freaking out about my feet and said i would probably have to go to the podiatrist some time or later and if i didn't get it fixed i would need surgery (but he said that would be in the next like 5 years).

I have a few IRAs and trusts set aside with other investments such as stocks and cds, plus I will ultimately sell my current home that is paid off.  Will I be able to get funding for a new home purchase?"

20090309124307AAd8Kj7	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Health Care	Should I go for this? (CNA + High school?) This is a long-looking one, but I'd appreciate any input.?	First off, let me say that, aside from a couple of electives and 2 (each) English/Global credits, I'm pretty much done with my Advanced Regents Diploma credits (I took honors courses starting in Middle school, so I'm, for the most part, a year ahead.) I would like to pursue a career in health care, most likely and RN (In Hospice, perhaps?)      As a junior and senior (I'm a sophomore, planning my schedule right now.), I can take a half-school-day (4 of 8 periods) class (BOCES Vo-Tech, if you're familiar with it.) that will end in me getting a (free!) Nurse Assisting Certification (therefore, depending upon what my not-really-considered,-to-be-honest college life looks like, a pretty decent job), lots of science/English credits, and, from what I've been told, something that looks really good on College apps. (Plus, it would give me two years to figure out if this is even the kind of work I want to do, and no commitment if I want to leave after a semester.)      This would be in addition to my AR diploma (I'd do regular classes for the other half of the day, obviously.)      My only dilemma is whether it would be a better move to just load up on regular classes. Here are my courses for next year (Keep in mind that I have another year after this, that's even more open... I'll only HAVE TO take 1 class as a senior, so anything I don't take next year, I can do as a Senior.), according to my (rather unhelpful, actually) guidance counselor (classes I'll definitely be taking, regardless, have an asterisk by them):   -Honors English*   -US History*   -French*   -Gym/Human Anatomy* (Alternating - every other day.)   -Typing   -Forensics (I don't know. She just plopped me in there. I hear it's an easy A, though...)   -College Alg. (Def. Taking this one at some point in the next 2 years.)   -Piano (I'm currently in the beginner class and love it.)

20090309130339AAZBhNI	Business & Finance;Credit	Experian report shows incorrect information- needed for a tenancy?	I'm based in the UK and currently looking to rent a new house. I will need to go through a rental agency as there's not many private landlords advertising at the moment.      I have checked my credit report on Experian as I want to see how likely it is that I will be granted a tenancy. My report has shown a CCJ - I knew that was there, I have paid this off and need to apply to the court to have it show as satisfied on my credit report.      I also had an IVA which I ended and am now paying any outstanding debts via a debt management plan. Despite the fact that my IVA wasn't finished it is showing on my credit report as satisfied and, as such, my report shows that I have no debt. I do still have debt and it is being paid via the DMP.      I explained my situation to the rental agency. My situation came about due to a failed business and I have taken on no other debt since.      Would my position be considered favourably by a landlord? My report reads that I have no debt but I have never seen a credit report before and am unsure if this is the same information that the agency would see.      I have been upfront about my credit. I live in rented accommodation at the moment and the rent is up-to-date.      Sorry if this is a bit long winded. I'm trying to explain fully.

Obama said last night that the bailout wasn't meant for those that bought a house they couldn't afford, or speculators.. it's meant for the common person that can't afford their payments because their home values have plummeted. Is their some special morgage that causes payments to rise when values go down? I've always figured that when you sign a contract you agree to pay a set monthly payment for 15-30 years or whatever your agreement is.      I can understand if these people are wanting to get out of thier house but it's not worth as much anymore, but that's not what everyone is saying is happening. It's the people that want to live their that just can't afford the payment anymore because their value went down.

And I have a variety of interests in what I want to be when I grow up.      First a Psychiatrist, I'm taking Psychology next year to see if I would actually consider this for a career. I enjoy helping people with their problems.      Second: A Dentist. I have amazingly perfect teeth (never had braces) and just seem to enjoy dentistry. Maybe starting out at a Dental Assistant then actually becoming a Dentist...?      Third: Something to do with helping Marine Animals, esp. Whales, Turtles, Dolphins..etc. And working closely with them; like being in the water with them. Or just educating people; such as in a Zoo.      Fourth: Pilot. I want to get my pilots license so bad! I love flying! As in a Pilot for a commerical airline or private company that pays very well.       I know. My career ideas are ALL OVER the place.    Any ideas? And I would like to work for the Government; considering benefits.   And I want to eventually make- 80k plus.      Thanks so much for taking the time to read this!
20090309160343AAJGj9n	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	IRS being unfair....?	My friend made a mistake filing her taxes last year for 2007 so she had to pay $2000 (not an actual figure) to IRS. But on September last year, IRS told her they made a mistake that they should have not charged her with $2000 so they returned it back to her. But today, when my friend filed her taxes, IRS told her that they learned that they should have not returned her the $2000- that she really needed to pay them but they thought she should have not. So anyway, my friend is supposed to get a $1000 refund this year but IRS took that since she "owe them $2000". Now they're telling me friend that she still owes them $1000 to fulfill that $2000. Problem is, my friend spent the money already and doesn't know where to get a thousand right now. Is that NOT so fair?? IRS made a mistake and now being unfair to my friend? Hoe can my friend appeal to this?? It wasn't her fault when IRS returned her her $2000.      Please Help

20090309164942AAkEMsG	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Is it wrong to do this?	So I had this job opportunity that I let down :( I just feel like crying.      I am a new mom. My son is 3 months old. I had a new job but I just couldnt take it anymore keeping my son at a daycare almost 8-9 hours a day. I dont really NEED to work bec my husband's salary is enough and we can even save from it, but I like working and dont like staying at home.      So I had 2 interviews with a university to work as a web editor, but this other new job I chose was going to pay me a lot. I suffered from depression after having my son when the manager of the university emailed me asking me to send him back my resume so that he shows it to his director bec she wants to meet with me as its the last stage of the interview process. He interviewed me like 4 months prior to it and waited for me until I delivered my baby.   So I didnt send him anything, and didnt even reply back as I said I was sick from depression.. so when I decided to stop my new job, I was told that at the univ the working hours are from 8am-1pm for new moms bec they give 2 breastfeeding hours. SO Was in SHOCK. I emailed him back but he replied telling me that since they never heard from me so they recruited another lady. I am so so sad. I emailed him back and told him I was sad, but I would like him to keep my resume for future opportunities.      I just knew that his father used to work with me in my previous job. We arent friends.. I just used to say hello to him.. is it bad if I email him back asking if he could pass up my resume to someone he knows there? and add in the email that I know his father? maybe it helps? I would really like to work, but I am just into searching for a place that suits my life now as a mother.. the working hours are imp for me bec I dont want to leave my son at a daycare that long.

A girl at work filed bankruptcy 6 mos ago, and now has a nice new house and really good credit. does this work for everyone?      or should i consider a consolidation loan for the individual credit blemishes that i have? will they negotiate down the amounts that i own on credit cards (all under $1000). or will they just take the numbers at face value?      or should i try to negotiate them down myself individually, althought this will take alot longer to pay off.       or should i just apply for the home loan anyway based on the fact that i live in michigan where most families have atleast one member out of work, so a family with two incomes and reasonably low debt, albeit bad credit, might be worth something.

I am waiting to start a new job as a support worker...my CRB form came back clear about 2 weeks ago and since then all my new employer has been waiting for is a reference form my current employer. i have been asking about it for ages and the manager said he had sent it off. the other company hasn't yet recieved it and are finding it very difficult to get hold of anyone that knows what's going on. i've been chasing it up for ages but keep getting palmed off for other things the manager claims he needs to do.    what i wanted to know is would i be allowed to ask my new employer for a blank reference form from them to take to my current manager to fill out, then take it back to them? the reason i'm asking is cos i thought that they wouldnt want to do this in case i were to fill it out myself (which i wouldn't but they couldn't be sure of that i know) which would be fraud. it seems like this is the only way to make sure it gets done as faxing and posting it through to him hasn't worked so far.

I walked out of a job 4 years ago without giving my two weeks notice because of a stressful work environment. I might add this job to my work experience under my resume (I worked there for 3 years). Is it likely that an interviewer will call this establishment to talk to my previous manager about why I left, even if it was a long time ago? I've had two other jobs after that and kept them each for about 2 years (I'm currently unemployed). One was seasonal and the other was a work study program that I couldn't do anymore because I graduated from college. I'm trying to find out whether I should omit this part of my work history. I just don't want to sound suspicious when I get asked "why did you leave that company". Also, what would be a good thing to say if I get asked that, I want to say something that won't make me look bad. I'm sure most of us have had jobs that become unbearable at a certain point. Thanks everyone.

The company is threatening to fire me because I have heard that they are afraid the union will come in. The men under me naturally don't like me for the most part, but I have made big changes for the good according to the division manager. I was the only one who received an increase in pay. The terminal manager did not because his job performance was poor. Anyway, there is talk that they will fire me for doing what they hired me to do. The men under me now come to work at regular hours. Work when they are told and are doing so much better. I consider myself fair, but if one is drunk the night before and chooses to not come to work due to a "hangover" the next day, I am not understanding about this type of thing! They are doing a survey to see who likes me and who does not. All of a sudden, the company is viewing me as a villain because those under me have "reasons" why they do not like me. These same guys have been written up over and over for the same things and they are angry with me for writing them up. There is talk I will be fired despite my good work for the company. If they fire me, do I have a case for wrongful termination? Thanks!
20090227144744AAQsoYD	Business & Finance;Investing	I am a Real Estate and Finance major. Should I major in Accounting (and get the CPA) too?	I am a Junior at a State University. Currently I am double majoring in Real Estate and Finance. My expected graduation, as of now, is May 2010. I am a little concerned about the finding a job after college, with the outlook for Finance and Real Estate jobs not being so hot. I would like to work in the Real Estate/Investment world (not brokerage or appraisal), possibly working for a REIT or something similar. I considering continuing my education for another year and getting an additional agree, this one being a B.S. in Accounting and going for my CPA. I have heard that a strong accounting background is very valuable in the business world and will also make you more marketable when looking for a job. What I am really wondering is= Is it really that beneficial and worth it to take another year of classes to get a degree in accounting? Or would it be a waste of time, and I should just attempt to enter the job market in 2010 with my Finance and Real Estate Degree?

He apparently did not pay off a credit card debt from years ago (long before I even met him). He just got paid today and there is still a hold on our bank account. So, not only was our bank overdrawn by 2K after he got paid we only have $500 in our account. And since there is still a hold on our account we don't have access to that money. He informed me today that the hold won't go away for about 30-90 days. We won't even be able to the bills this month, how are we supposed to survive the next 3 months?! I really need help. I don't know anything about this and I don't know what to do!! What's the best way to get some cash quick so we can pay our bills and survive the next couple of months.

In contrast to American firms, Japanese firms frequently make lifetime employment commitments to their workers and agree not to lay them off when product demand is weak. Other things being equal, we would expect Japanese firms to:    A)   face more elastic product demand curves than American firms.    B)    have relatively greater variable costs than American firms.    C)    discontinue production at higher product prices than would American firms.

OK so I did something awful and illegal and I know it was wrong but I was really selfish and oh my god I'm totally screwed over.   OK so heres what happen. I'm 15, my dad is 56. I was greedy and wanted some new things and I knew he has good credit. So I went to Bank of America online, and ordered a credit card in his name and got one for me as an authorized user. I had it Fedex'ed to the house and I got the cards, activate them and all good. Went online to open and account for online banking, found out my dad had an account and the cards I got without his permission would show up on his online account. Then after talking to them, I got it so he couldn't see them. Oh thank god. Now, at the time, money wasn't the problem because I had this grand idea I would just pay the minimum payment. OK well, today I went to Manhattan and had myself a lovely shopping day, spent about oh IDK $3000. No joke.   So I get home, and dumb old Bank of America sent us another set of cards. This time dad found them before me. ****! So I was so scared, I lied threw my teeth and made up some story why they had my social security number and his and how it got here to the house.   He didn't really buy it but it got them off my back and he's cooled off a while and he's going to take care of them tomorrow.   OK so now I need help to clean up my lies. I'm really crying. First, I need you to yell at me and tell me how much I messed up and tell me what I did was wrong because I don't really feel bad, I'm more like scared.      Next, I need to get this account GONE so when he calls tomorrow, they won't tell him anything.   First, I know where he put the cards, there on the counter, he's going to work and my mom is already sleeping. OK so good. I'm going to take the extra cards and hide them. Then I'm going to call Bank of America and close the account.   Is there any way that when he calls tomorrow they (customer service) can act totally stupid and act like they have no idea what I'm talking about?   I'm so fucked and I know it but I can't admit what I did to their faces. I need to take care of this myself, I know I know but I need to.   OH MY GOD please help me. What do I do so he doesn't have access to the account. Whenever I call they say it all falls under the same social security number so the customer service rep has access to all of the numbers and cards, and I don't want them to help with this one. Jeez. I fucked up so bad. First, yell at me, then help me.   Maybe email me with help? Banking experts, please email me and help me. I know I messed up, now it's time to fix things. It was illegal and wrong. I'm more nervous and scared than sorry right now.   HELP!

I am renting a home built in the late 1950s from my family. I expect that they will sell it several years in the future. There are many repairs to be made, but it seems like the biggest one would be the windows. Particularly in the back of the house there is a four pane set of original jealousy (or jalousie) windows.* They are semi-open constantly, and while they are a nice character trait for the house, the mechanism that closes them cannot make them flush. I believe this is going to be a major point for anyone considering buying the home and if my family wants to make any money off of the sale they must fix this by replacing them. My family is wary of this repair, but I think it's essential!      * These windows work kinda like horizontal blinds.

Then he said well but something else had to happen right, what about job, i said i have a job, he said something else had to happen, so I stuttered and said well my work cut my hours, (to a degree) and pay(to a degree no overtime) He then said when was the last time I [paid my bills on time I had to think, some reason I couldnt remember exactly, and my lawyer never told me that the question would be ask, so I said Aug 08, but thinking about it it could be Jan 08. Did I screw up?

I have been paying a minimum payment of ￡40.00 a month for the last year to Aktiv Kapital, and I recently wrote to them telling them that I cannot afford to keep up the payments. I received a letter from them today saying they can offer ma a once in a lifetime opportunity, saying that I can clear my outstanding debt of ￡19,176.00 if I make a single payment of ￡450 within the next 14 days, they say this will clear the debt and they will update the credit agencies that my account is paid in full. Anyone else had this, and should I just pay the ￡450? It works out that they only want 2.5% of the balance, writing off the other 97.5%

20090309172726AA9YZSe	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	A "Gainskeeper" tax question?	I have Gainskeeper though Scottrade. It is a great tool,.but it screwed up on one stock. I transferred 1,000 shares of METLIFE (all I had) to Scottrade Mar 7, 2008--unfortunately Gainskeeper did not "recognise" the transfer, and so, when I sold MET in stages it kept listing "error--you have zero stock" when it was not true. OK, here's the problem--I can manually enter those 1,000 shares  in Gainskeeper--BUT the process of doing that demands "purchase date"-- one "purchase date" with no other options. Well, I bought these 1,000 shares over 3-4 years at various amounts. As such, there is no "single" purchase date. can I just arbitrarily pick a date? (Like Dec 31, 2007)--which would also show these shares to be long term, over a year? (right now, in error, a few MET shares I bought later--NOT the 1,000- listed as short term) By the way 1)  The Gainskeeper site said "ask Scottrade"--and Scottrade says (the date) is "up to you."

20090309170648AAViDbc	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	How many exemptions can be claimed before information is reported/flaged to the IRS?  I believe it was 9!!!?	Most answers I've seen on this topic are technically correct but my issue is not what is correct but what throws it up into the face of the IRS.  I believe and it might be the IRS can require support for the number claimed but typically they don't do this until the amount reaches a threshold, I'm looking for this number.  Is it 9, 10 or does it just depend, which seems highly unlikely given who we are dealing with here?  They need to have something flagged before they find it and I want to know what that number is.        For all of you out there who like paying taxes -  GOD BLESS YOU!!! - I want all my money back or at least what I'm legally allowed and I want it long before April 15.  I don't like lending my money to the IRS, they don't pay interest on money they borrow.        For example, right now, the government is in crisis and in CA, a month later, I've still not received my $500 and when I do finally get it, it will be no more than the amount shown on my return.  The State Controller even had the nerve to tell people the refund checks had to be delayed to pay bills actually owed by the state.  Now that's an explanation for you.  Apparently, my money is a gift until CA decides to give it back.        Same with the FEDs!!!  Get your money while you can.  Don't let them have a penny extra.  Believe me they will spend it and your return on your investment in "public services" if you are lucky is maybe $0.05 on the dollar and that really does assume we are lucky.  The greening of our country would be best served by first cleaning up all the trash and waste of our government from the Fed's all the way down to the smallest governmental entity.

What should we do?	two years ago my parents bought a small restaurant. they believed it was a good deal and investing our money in it would be wise. aside from the obvious lack of income because of the recession   the Business has only been able to pay for itself. the contract increased the rent over one thousand in less then a year, and our rent is truly ridiculous, over 3,000 a month for a small space, 54 max occupancy. We have tried selling, but the landlord's high rent and negative attitude brings down any potential buyers. We advertise at the college in front of us, but it does little to help, including online marketing. We are weeks away from declaring bankruptcy at this rate. Our contract is not over for 3 more years. We can't continue paying for only employees, bills, and the rent leaving us only  with less than a few hundred in earnings. What can we do?

I have recently been told at work that I am at risk of being made redundant as the company feel my job in OST will be more cost effectively carried out by our team in India.      The letter received from them states,       “we therefore propose that the work will transfer to (company Name) India PVT Limited with the effect from the 23rd of March 2009.    You would have the option of moving to India to carry out the job there if you wished. If you do not wish to do so, unfortunately your job is at risk and you may, subject to the completion of consultation, bedsides by reason of redundancy as a result.”       I had my follow up meeting today 09th of March 2009, in which it was a chance to put my views across as to why the company should keep the job in the UK, I being only 21 and with no children or mortgage, have looked into this, I know that nobody  has ever taken them up on relocation to India but as my job is still available it would be a great opportunity to work abroad and under the current situation of the recession, I have therefore decided to call there bluff and have asked to be relocated to India.      In this meeting I have asked for the Terms & Conditions of the relocation which they do not have and have said that they will have to write up and continue the meeting for Thursday this week. They have also advised me that I would be responsible for payment of my flight and accommodation to get there and that I would get paid on the same rate of those already employed in India  (I think in a bid to put me off relocating)       Surely if my job is available in another country and they have said and I quote “you would have the option of moving to India to carry out the job there if you wished” .      Surely the company is responsible for the payment of the relocation and surely my pay should be kept the same as its not that my job is obsolete, it has just been moved to another department within the company which just so happens to be in India?      I feel many people being made redundant are not looking at the whole picture, and maybe this is why I cant find any answers on Direct.Gov.uk or any other website for that matter.       Could any one please help me urgently on this problem I would be grateful for any answers and help.      Many thanks

20090309124751AAyuKnv	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Law & Legal	Former Employer won't give me my 2 weeks severance, what can I do?	My last employer wanted to make me part time (from 5 days to 2). I then told them I'd rather be laid off completely, as they then did. Once I brought up our employment agreement that stated two weeks pay, the employer then go really upset and cussed me out until they made me leave. After walking me through the office out the door to make sure I didn't steal anything, they then said they would give me my two weeks. I told them I'd be back to get it.      I filed for unemployment which i get, and I hear the former employee was pissed about this (what did they expect?).      I've contacted this person 3 times about this two weeks pay, and they refuse to discuss it, stating they have to talk with their lawyers first.       This former employer is very much a con in the ways of business and ethics, and I'm assuming they are not going to give me my two weeks, especially now that its been almost a month since they laid me off.       What are my options here? It is just two weeks, is going to court spending way more on lawyer fee's the only way?

20090309125019AAGQRqT	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	What would happen if we broke a rent lease?	so we find out our electricity will be shut off, along with water, and it has in the past before several times.   my husband and i live with two guys. One of which is supposed to be collecting the money for the bills, i don't know where the money is going to. the 2 guys are both brothers so when we confront one they both have a fit.    kind of a last straw we were awaken this morning with them needing utility money 2 days before it is due.One of them needs to go to the hospital for an infected tooth (bc they don't brush their teeth) ugh. But we know it won't go to bills. And the guy it's going to is ungrateful, never goes to work, never cleans, doesn't contribute to anything and has temper tantrums all the time.   and we know the electric will be shut off this weekend if it doesn't go towards that.    when we refused they freaked out screaming at us. Said it was going to be our fault the electric was getting shut off this weekend.    Now, they did apologize but this is something that happens so much, the sorries don't register with us anymore.    we need out, simple as that but our lease still has another six months. We pay 212mo each with the four of us. would me and my husband actually have to fork out 6 payments of that to legally leave?? is there a way we could leave without such a financial burden?
20090309125112AAQJkBr	Business & Finance;Insurance	Ex boss said that I have to pay Stimulus Cobra on the months that I didn't have insurance? Doesn't seem right.?	I was laid off in Jan.and I guess she told the insurance that I was laid off end of December because she is asking me to pay for 35% for Jan, Feb, and March.  March should be the only one I would need to pay for (I would think) but I can't find information on the web proving this.
20090309125143AAtJmRN	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	How easy is it to fire a seller real estate agent?	I'm a buyer.  I found a place I like.  It's 600,000 (2-3 family).  I found it on my own by chance, without an agent, and without anything the selling agent did, unless she put the sign in the window.   I googled and tulia-ed it and found the selling agent's listing.  I emailed the agent.  4 days, no reply.  I emailed again.  1 day later, short reply.  A few days later I emailed again with 1 follow-up question and saying I wanted to see the place Sunday, anytime, or let me know when she's available.  That was 4 days before Sunday, and it's now Monday with no reply.  I searched the deed records office for the property to get the owner's name, and superpaged the name and found what I'm 99.9% sure is the owner's phone number.  I'm going to pursue this property with the owner now, but I want to know if he can get out of the real estate arrangement to enhance our ability to find a mutually acceptable bid.   Now, obviously, if they have a signed contract, that is controlling, but having not yet spoken to the seller, I’m looking for “common-practice” information.      (for what it's worth, I think the real estate agent business is wholly inefficient, but I'm not in charge of such things, so if she did anything close to her job, I wouldn't be looking to use her 6% to bridge the bidding gap.)

20090309125608AAid12v	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Temping and its effect on Unemployment Ins?	So, I was recently laid off, and have just filed Unemployment. I make about $400/week [$10/hr] on Unemployment      In the past, I worked with quite a few temp agencies, and as such, I do get a bunch of calls for Temp and Temp to Perm positions.      My question is...should I take Temp or Temp to Perm Jobs while I am on Unemployment? Will I have to discontinue and then restart Unemployment Ins each time I take a temp job? Is it possible that if I take a short-term Temp Job, then reapply for Unemployment afterwards that I will be denied because of the Temp Job?       I guess what it comes down to is...What are your thoughts on Temping during Unemployment? Do you think its valid, or is it better to wait until you've found a full time, direct hire position?      The reason I'm asking is that I know that there are a lot of Temp to Perm jobs out there, and I don't want to shut off a whole portion of the market, unless necessary.      Any info appreciated, thanks!      BTW, I live in California, if that makes a difference.
