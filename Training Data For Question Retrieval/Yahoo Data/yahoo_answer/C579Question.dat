Now, we go there, and we take a questionnaire. Every time the woman asks a question that is obviously associated with ADD, and my family answers 'No', she'll push it until they answer 'Well...Maybe, sometimes, I guess.'       When we leave she puts me on a 60mg dose of strattera, once a day, "to help with bedwetting." This is an outright lie. She said it was explicitly for sphincter control, to both me, and my parents. Nothing about how it's used to treat ADD and ADHD, and usually in very small doses on adolescents.      We're not going back.      So now I'm sitting here, with two boxes of 60mg Strattera, and wondering what to do with them. I'm just thinking-...Maybe they'll help my anxiety problems. I am fidgety, and nervous, because of anxiety issues. I've been on painkillers and have noticed a serious difference in my ability to relax, and concentrate on things I want to do when I'm with people who cause me a lot of stress.      So, what's Strattera like in high dosages?

OK, there's this guy that I see from time to time..Wally. Anyhow, everyone says he's crazy, and it is apparent that he suffers from some sort of mental illness where he thinks he is immortal, feels he has been abducted by aliens on several occasions, says he has eight wives all over the world, and one is in space waiting for him. He says things like, "I'm scared" out of the blue and thinks everyone is jealous of his otherworldiness. He says he can tell me the future and feels he can put force fields on people to protect them.      I think he's super interesting and I just like hearing him talk.        But, i'm wondering if is it safe to associate with someone like that.

20090128092006AAsnmSN	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	YIKES!!!  I don't think I want to take morphine ever again!?	I recently had surgery, and was prescribed morphine for pain.  Well, like a trooper, I tried to tough it out as best I could (addiction run rampant in my family), well, this morning, I couldn't take it anymore, so I decided, well, I'll just cut one up int 1/4's.  I took one of 1/4's and for about the first 15 min. I felt nothing, so I thought well, whatever, I'm not taking anymore than that.  30 min. later, I started feeling a strange burning sensation up in my rib cage (the soft part where they do the chest compressions), and then this strange spasming in the same spot started. Now, I've called my doctor, and I'm just waiting for him to call back, but while I wait, I wanted to know if anyone else has gone through this and what he** is it???  I tried to vomit the pill back up, with no luck, but it seems like the only way to make the pain go away, is the gagging reflex when my stomach sucks in, but that only last about 5 minutes before the pain comes back.  I can breathe fine, as long as I don't take deep breaths, but this pain is moving into my shoulders (like a gall bladder attack but in both shoulders).  Is this an allergic reaction?  I have learned my lesson and I'm going to take the pills back to the pharmacist.  How do I make the pain go away?  I would cry but that would probably make the pain worse.

It started about two years ago as a weird tingling in that area that would come and go.  Then, it would feel like I my back needed to be cracked or adjusted in that area and started to feel uncomfortable.  Now I have pain which sometimes radiates down my left arm into my fingers.  It hurts more when I take a deep breathe, but I'm not congested nor do I have a cough.      I've been to the doctors for this, all they did was a simple x-ray and when they didn't see anything, they said that I must have pulled a muscle and it would go away soon.  Its not going away, and it doesn't feel like a pulled muscle, its starting to feel like nerve pain.      What is going on with me?

I'm sorry this is long, but PLEASE read it and answer it. Please...      Ok, well, my fiance Patrick's best friend Andy has recently tried to commit suicide... twice. He's in the hospital now, and Patrick goes to see him a lot, and says Andy just doesn't want to live anymore. This is really hard on Patrick... Him and Andy are both 26 and have been friends since they were 13. I've been worried about Patrick lately, because he's an independent singer/guitarist and has been writing some really dark, depressing lyrics. Well, tonight, he was changing, and I saw a cut on his hip. So automatically, thinking the worst, I think "Oh My God, he's cutting himself." So I asked him about it, and he told me that he hurt himself lifting things at work... he works at a local concert hall and sets up the stage for concerts... It does involve a lot of lifting and physical work. I'm still worried, though... He's the kind of guy who will bottle up his feelings just because he doesn't want to cause more trouble for others by letting them out. I'm just so worried that he is actually cutting himself... I can't lose him... I know it might sound like I'm overreacting, but I don't even know what I'd do if I found out he WAS cutting himself... Him and I are going for counseling together starting this weekend, but I'm still so worried.      Also, Patrick and I both have diagnosed depression, but it's never been serious before. Just more sadness than others have.      But I'm soooo scared right now abut the cut on his hip... What should I do? What do you think? Do you think he's cutting or no?      Thank you      And also, I know it's a rare place for someone to cut, but like, what if he cut there on purpose so that there's less of a chance of me seeing it?   It's also pretty much a straight cut... It looks kind of... jagged? I don't know how to describe it, but it's pretty much straight.      Oh, and also, he told me in the past that he had cut himself back before his depression was diagnosed... when he was about 20.

20090128100828AA8bHzM	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Cancer	Kidney Cancer (renal cancer) question?	My Grandmother has just been diagnosed with this cancer and by the time they found out she had it it has spread to her vertebrae and both lungs. They say her prognosis is very poor. She is in constant pain in the hospital to the point where my mom can't even be with her.      My question here is can this cancer still be destroyed even though it has spread to all these different areas? i've searched all over the internet and read a multitude of different articles on this particular cancer, but couldn't find what I just specified about it. The tumor in her kidney is so big it has invaded the lymph nodes as well.      I never really got to know my grandmother or get close with her, but I hate seeing my mother suffer. If you could give me a link of the information or have personal knowledge about this I would be extremely grateful.       So the questions are: Is it possible to beat the cancer when it has progressed thus far; if so what are the chances of survival if she can; and if you have any links on this sort of information i can examine.      I'm so sick of cancer...

Ah,I just got a root canal done  on my upper right tooth Monday..and ever since then I've been having this really foul taste and smell around the tooth,on the tooth, and on the tooth's gumline. It's really bad,almost until the point where it's making me feel sick. It smells kind of like the dentist office, which is why im wondering if it's due to like an irragation tool that they use?

The top of my left foot went completely numb over a yr ago and the feeling never came back. The orthopedic Dr. thought it was classic L5 disc herniation but MRI I got only showed moderate disc degeneration, meaning the disc isn't completely herniated, just bulging and the bulge is to the right not the left. I've seen various Dr's and had MRI's, Xrays, Lab work, EMG's ( nerve conduction studies) and no one has been able to find the cause of my numbness. I have also tried physical therapy and chiropractic care... which only made things worse. I wouldn't be so concerned if it didn't occasionally spread up my leg and I am also experiencing weakness in my legs and have started limping and I lose my balance easier than I used to. I have back pain, leg pain, and numbness and tingling in my feet along with shooting electrical sensations. My most recent doctor called me and told me there is nothing else he can do for me! I'm miserable, and in constant pain and I don't know how much longer I can live like this.

20090128092306AAf9pCx	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Respiratory Diseases	Pneumonia - Insomnia?	Alright, so I thought I had a sore throat and cold since Saturday, and Saturday and Sunday I had a hard time sleeping (I would be awake from 2-4 ish in the morning) because it hurt to swallow, but on Monday and Tuesday I started having wet coughs, thick chunky mucus, and it was bad enough to the point where I'd cough and cough and the mucus would get stuck in my throat until I coughed so hard I threw up. Yesterday when I coughed, I could see what looked like dried blood in my mucus (it wasn't caused by food because I hadn't eaten that day), so I went to see a doctor and he thinks I have pneumonia. He prescribed me 1g clarithromycin per day for ten days. But Monday night and last night I didn't sleep at all because my throat feels extremely dry, it hurts to swallow, I overheat and then suddenly get chills, and I have a constant migraine that no amount of tylenol, aspirin, or advil has gotten rid of. Monday night I took four pills of Melatonin and didn't fall asleep till six in the morning, so yesterday I bought extra strength Unisol (diphenhydramine hydrochloride 50mg) and took one last night to try and fall asleep but it didn't make me feel drowsy in the least, so four hours later I took another one and still made no difference: I didn't sleep last night or even feel drowsy.       Does pneumonia cause insomnia? What can help me fall asleep? Any help with any of my problems would be appreciated.

20090128092633AAziOF0	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Diabetes	Diabetic Foot Sore from ankle cast?	My husband is a type 1 diabetic. A week and a half ago he broke his ankle and is currently wearing a cast. We thought the swelling would go down by now but it has not. He's also developed a couple of sores on the top of his foot from the swelling and the tightness of the cast. These are very, very minor sores, but I understand that bad things can happen. He does not have insurance and had to go to the emergency room to get the cast put on. I'm just looking for any advice I can find. Web-MD advised:   Put a triple antibiotic cream on the foot sore immediately    Cover the wound with a light gauze and keep pressure off the area       I think I should also clean the sores with peroxide or something, but I'm not certain.       Anyone had a similar issue? Any advice? I know ideally I should take him to a Doctor or clinic, but I'm not certain we can afford it. To make matters worse, we're also in the middle of a horrible ice storm and I'm unable to get closer than a half mile from my house. There is no way my husband can make it downhill on ice covered steps using crutches. We don't expect the roads to be clear for a few days, so I'm looking for DIY answers.

20090225131810AAufcOx	Health;Mental Health	I'm going to confront my mom and dad about my childhood? I was molested when I was little?	I told my mom when I was 13 but she told me I was a liar and I never got any help for it. I don't remember who molested me but I know it happened. She was also very cold hearted to me as a child. I was singled out, kind of like the black sheep of the family for a very long time until my older brother moved out. My mom favored him and basically whatever he said went and whatever he did was ok. The only reason why my mom and I have a relationship now is because my brother wont talk to her because she cut him off from the family funds and my mom and his wife do not get along. It's like since my brother couldn't use my mom anymore he wanted nothing to do with her. I feel as though my mom took the frustration she had with my older brother out on me. Instead of punishing him she punished me instead. My mother is a very good manipulator/liar. My father is a sailor and was gone for a good majority of my childhood. He has no idea that things were the way they were.       Every time I have tried to confront her in the past she says that I am ungrateful because she has done so much for me. And by that she means, bought me toys, took me to school, fed me, clothed me, etc. It's not that I am ungrateful but I feel when you decide to have a kid (or open your legs) you have an obligation as a parent to provide those things for your children. I am angry because she puts the blame on me even though I was the child and she was the adult. She controlled the situation and I did not. I need to confront her because I feel as if its an important part of me getting over my childhood and not being so angry.      I just called her and left a message on her phone asking if I could talk to her and my father without my younger siblings around (who still live at home) so we could talk about some "stuff". I feel if I tell her what I want to talk about she will try and get out of it.      For people who have confronted parents in the past for things that they have done, what did you do in your situation? Any advice anybody can give me is greatly appreciated.

The following monday, before I went to school I went in to see my oral surgeon just for a quick check up.I had extremly mild discomfort on one socket, almost nothing at all. He irrigated it cleaned it. basic stuff. but then he stuck the syringe INTO the socket. and pushed liquid into it, and I passed out from the pain, i have a high tolerance for pain. This was EXCRUCIATING!! and then when I woke up, he continued to say oh this is normal for people to pass out. and then packed it saying I had a dry socket when before I had NO symptoms AT ALL what-so-ever exsept for slight pain. I've looked EVERYWHERE on the internet and have not seen anything like this at all, with the pain. i've got to go in for a repacking and I'm REALLY scared its going to happen again. Is this normal?

20090128115634AAHlwMm	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Respiratory Diseases	Do you think I have dicovered something no one else has?	I was walking down in the canyon one day, and i went off the trail to go catch lizards and stuff with my bf, and I saw this interesting looking rock, and i picked it up and looked at it, and then i put it down because i didn't think it was all the interesting. As i was walking away from it, the hand i picked up the rock in started becoming numb, and i was really confused, and then my whole arm started becoming numb.   I went back over to the rock and picked it up again, i went over to my boyfriend and told him to hold the rock (he had no idea that it made me feel numb) and he held it in his hands and was like "why am i holding this?" i told him to give it back to me. A minute later he was like "woah, my hand feels really weird what the f*ck!?" i told him i felt like that too after i held the rock. I decided to take it home and i told my mom to hold it without her knowing and she felt the exact same thing. So did all my friends. (everyone felt different things like some people felt itchyness, numbness, and the tip of their fingers felt frozen)   I was really freaked out by this rock so i set it in my backyard. I hadn't touched it for a couple days, and i decided to hold it again a couple weeks later. I held it again and put it back down. I waited a couple minutes and didn''t feel anything. 5 minutes later i still didn't feel anything. My boyfriend came out and  grabbed the rock again to see if he felt anything. His finger tips started numbing up. I still didn't feel anything so i walked into the house to get something to drink. I started noticing that i was unconsciously itching. I was looking at the rings on my finger, and one was a mood ring, and when i looked at my mood ring it was PURE black. It has NEVER been black before. And it's weird because thats the only hand that i held the rock in. I told my boyfriend to put the mood ring on with the hand he held the rock in, and it also turned black. Then i went up to my mom, and told her to put the mood ring on, and it turned green and blue. same with everyone else who didn't touch the rock in the house.   I don't get it! I'm so confused and I think I might have found something. It was hidden where no one would even care to pick it up or even see it. Could i have found something big?    Do you think I could maybe turn it into a science lab or get it tested and possibly make money off it?      I'm being completely serious about this, i'm not lieing at all or over exaggerating any of this.   It's tripping me out so much.      What do you think?

My boyfriend lives in Denmark and I live in England, he will be moving here in June (we are waiting for his dogs passport to be completed)      He has been on sick leave for a year due to depression and over in Denmark they make you go to a school thing for 12 - 24 weeks and    assess you and get you back into work. His time there finished before christmas but due to staffing issues no one sorted his job out, but the sick pay he gets from the union runs out on Friday. He cant go and get a job himself because if he relapses then he will never get any state help      In denmark you pay into a union and are allowed 2 years sick leave, he had a previous year when he had a serious shoulder injury.      He has just had a letter through the post about some doctors appointment for some test, but wont explain it to me at the moment because he is really frustrated and doesn't want to talk till later tonight.      I just don't want all this stress to make him relapse into his depression as last time he had a rating of 9+ on a sale of 10, where 10 is the most severe.      I am in such a state, I want to be there for him but cant, i always seem to be saying the wrong things and somehow winding him up .... he has always said communication is important but lately has just not been interested in talking .... I don't know what to do      I just want to get him to move to England now, but he lives with his ssister and has to give 3 months notice on the apartment he lives in. I ccan fully support him here that's not a problem.      What can I say to him to make him feel better .... I feel so helpless aand sad .... and I am stressed myself as I am revising for my masters exams which are next week :(

I hate to say it, but I really need those things to do decently at school. The prescriptions were supposed to have me covered for half a year, and I've only used the first one.       I'm going to explain the situation to my doctor, and I called today to schedule a phone call with him. When the receptionist (or whatever) learned that it was Aderall prescriptions needing replacement, she laughed and in this little chiding voice goes, "You probably won't..." and says she'll have him call me back to see what he can do. What she said was rude (well, the way she said it) and makes me angry, but it mostly makes me nervous.    I know Aderall is tightly watched, but? I've been going to this doctor for years and we have never lost a prescription. I don't know how all the regulations work exactly. Given the situation, is there much that could stop him?

I have a lamp on the side of my wrist that has been there since beginning of December or middle of November & it feels like a bone but I don't think it is because it feels to round and pointy but it doesn't move. it feels the same size it did since when I first noticed it and sometimes my wrist gets like a little shock of pain for a couple of minutes but that very irregular. Do you think it could be cancerous, because I really don't want to go to the Doctors. Firstly, because I’m scared that it’ll be cancerous and secondly, because I’m scared that they could find more than one thing wrong with me. So please leave your comments on what you really think I ought to do, please and thank you.

20090128110555AAbLzwa	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	I have Sle and suffer from chronic pain any suggestions on how to live a normal life?	How to live a normal life when your pain is different everyday.   I am the typical story, I suffered for one year with doctors disbelief that something was wrong  with me even after the rash broke out covering almost my entire body, it wasnt until I ended up in the ER for two weeks when I finally got the definete answers to my elements. I have SLE,discoud lupus, now lupus nepritis and so on. Now my first indication that something was wrong with me was joint pain(i thought carpool tunnel), but the pain eventually spread everywhere and then the fatigue, and then swollen joints and raynuads syndrome,so of course then fibromayglia. When I left the hospital I wasn't as fatigued but the pain never went away nor the joint swelling, just a differnet joint everyday,so for five yrs I'v been on oxycotin and percocet to live a more pain managed life, but sometimes my symptoms get even worse( how could they?) they do basically my joint pain becomes every joint, the pain medicnes stop working, I cant walk without a walker or I walk very slow and painfully, so I tell my doctor as always andwe run more labs, platlets at 60K,but not low enough for her to be concerned shes waitin for mor test results, she says that although I have these sypmtoms including a lovely rash, that my lupus may not be active. Please anyone is this BS or what? Can you have what is obviously a flare and it not be your lupus causing it? right now i am on imuran and plaqnil and i was on predinose for 4 years straight and finally said no more because it wasnt controlling these elments, she wants to but me back on it to bring my platlets up, but i know once i go off they go down again, I have been on every medicatio for sle and none have changed anything, I have had rituxan injects no chnage so last year we tried it again and i had an allergic reaction. She doesnt want to try cytoxan because she says it doesnt help with swollen joints fatigue or pain, does any one know or have any idea? please give me your suggestions, thank you and  sorry for the spelling my hands hurt and keep missing the letters.

(We really doubt it's pregnancy if that's what you're thinking). She didn't eat at all yesterday (she does that from time to time evcen though I hate it). She woke up this morning and has been throwing up stomach acid. She tried drinking milk but it came right back up. She smokes pot a lot, and exercises a lottt. (trust me, I've been trying to get her into a healthier lifestyle for the past year and a half but I'm having little luck). But she's also a vegetarian. I don't think she has the best dieting habits at all. I think she's depressed and stressed a lot, but she's convinced herself pot who is who she is and she hides that stuff behind it's use. So she's throwing up stomach acid, and has to poo at the same time she feels like while also crampy. But do you know of anything that could be causing this?
20090128113343AAXjwNk	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Allergies	13month old vomiting 1 week now...Soy Formula?	Hi everyone...    My son was on Similac formula the first 4 months. He began getting congested and the doctor said he had a "very slight" milk allergy. So we were told to switch to Similac Soy formula. So we did...    The congestion never left, and over time became sick and had Croup...etc.    So, now he's better and not congested anymore (antibiotics). However NOW he has thrown up randomly 4 times the past week. No change in diet recently. Still on Soy formula.     Today he threw up 4 times. Still acting normal, but can't keep formula down. He's had solid food and been fine. Juice he also does fine.    So should I cut the Soy and switch back to the lactose based Similac formula? Or try him on whole milk?    Any other thoughts?

20090128134637AA23g9f	Health;Mental Health	How do i get over this extremely depressing answer ?  ?	now i do feel like i wanna give up, definetley.      here was the link to the question i asked earlier :       http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...          here is the answer by  ' sledkane ':         ''   i hope can i be honest with you ,and give some solid life advice, no you should not give up your dreams, but you can't run away from your problems all your life also, but you need to be realistic about it also ! and set your self a time period where you feel comfortable trying to reach your goals, a time period mean like 5 years or ten years period, chasing a dream all your life also means your losing alot of other thing in life also ! because you can't plant your foot on the ground on anything solid,because your trying to chase your dreams,we all have dreams,i like to marry the most beautiful kind girl in the world,but is that realistic or not , to me it is unrealistic, just try to come to term with it ,and not waste your whole life chasing something that is impossible to reach, their are other ways you can do things to reach your goal , it may not be 100 percent of your goal but it could 50 percent off the 100 percent of my goal , could be 50 to 75 percent of your goals, this is how i would be trying to reach my goal, if i were in your position,number one thing you must stop feeling sorry for yourself, and stop thinking the whole world is against you,stop dwelling about the past and do something about it , for your your self go a take a course to get your self esteam and confendance up ! you said your past have not be so great and you done things that aren't so nice and people remember you of your past events , and people judgeing you as that same person,well why don't you prove that wrong, go and do some comunity work , like volintary helping the poor or the young kids with problems do it for 2 tor 3 years, that might change their minds about you, and once when the people start hearing about you , not being that same person in the past they remember you as, they would see you different , they would say everyone deserve a second chance,than they will treat you nicer, then you won't feel uncomfortable as you are now in uk , you would proably end liking uk more than you thought,because things have change for the better,maybe you end up finding a really nice girl in uk, believe me i really think uk is not your problems,you can't blame a city ,you were just trying to run away from your personal problems ,and you thought by going over sea will solve it, believe me going over sea don't solve anything , you have to solve you personal problem first ,more than anything else, because if your not happy in uk you won't be happy over sea, because you still have that personal problem, now if you still want to go over sea this is how im going to do it, try and find that it job, find a company that have a oversea office where you can be transfer over,or if you can't find a it job that you want , than just try to work in a regular job and save a lot of your money up and put a down payment to buy a vacation example property in spain or greece or italy and when you take your vacation every year you can go down their to visit and when you retire you can spend half the year in uk and the other half a year in your vacation property whether in spain or greece or italy!       now this is how i would do it ,and if i can't reach my 100 percent goal , reaching your goal does not mean it have to be 100 percent, if your open minded that your ok with just reaching a portion of your dreams being reached ,than you will still be very happy, but don't waste your whole life like trying to chase a impossible 100 percent dream,just be open minded that im ok with just a 50 percent of my dream being fill !but in order to reach your dream you have to plant your foot on solid ground in uk to start your dream , it won't be hard ,if you don't make it hard, if you read the first half of my article that how you would start ,make your self a better person for your self and those that saw you as that past person and those that don't believe you and prove them wrong, only you can change their mind by you showing that your not that same person.,      you are now 31,your not getting young , in 9 year you be forty ,right now what you do with you finacial situation ,is what you future holds for you,you can't be thinking about a new carer when you hit forty! that is unrealistic !your career is suppose to start right after college and university,your 31 now ,your like 7 to 8 years behind now!don't kid your self in 9 to 12 years your heading to middle age ,time is flying right by you, try to be realistic about things and not fantasy about things, be realistic and you be ok!set realistic goals! i hope i help you take care  ''            basically hes saying im screwed, gettin too old  and have NO  chance to fullfill my goals.   that  shortly in a few years , i will be ' TOO OLD '.

My cycle is usually 30 days long but the last ocuple of months it has changed up a little.  One month it was 42 days and the other about 35 days.  So this month I was not exactly sure where it should fall but it started on day 35 according to my charting, but when I started it was alway just spotting.  I thought it would get heavier b/c it always does and I usually cramp really bad.  This time Ijust wore a liner and probaly did not even have to.  I spotted light pink/orange/brown for a week.  Now I have continued to spot for 4 more days but now it is just brown.  I took one test during spotting but it was negative.  I am confused b/c I do have other symptoms but I had the one negative test.  My period has never been like this before since I have started and I am 31.  It always starts light and gets heavy.  I have been trying to lose weight lately but I am going at about the healthy 2 lbs. a week and never had this issue before when dieting.  Any advice, suggestions, etc. Thanks for any help in advanced.

I want to become stronger than my classmates, I want to know that my tough looks isn't just tough looks, and its the real deal. Lately I have been exposed to toxic chemicals like tobacco and stuff like that, because my brothers smoke often.       I noticed I am getting behind compared to my classmates stamina. Even people who look weak seem to beat me in basketball.       This put me in a very bad mood, so I want to find a most efficient way to raise stamina and strength within one year, and most likely the rest of my life.      SO when I hit college, I will become a different person.

20090128141414AAhEfHI	Health;Dental	Dental Hygiene, how to gain a raise and how that works?	I'm working to become a Dental Hygienist and I am just curious on how does pay raises work to  your advantage.  For example, when you work as a bartender and you're trying to get a raise you would bring paper work of inventory you've kept track of, the minimal losses you helped maintain, also advertisements you've created to help bring in people, and perhaps time in and out sheets that show you've never been late, always early and you always leave late.  This is what I would bring to a performance evaluation when I'm looking to get a pay increase.  What would you do in the Dental Hygiene field?    What could you do for Dental Hygiene to get a raise? Are there raises? And how much of an increase (range) would you expect?  Is there some sort of commission?    I think the starting salary is great already but of course it varies from place to place and also of course most people are always going to look to make a little more when they can.    If you have experience in the situation and field, I'd love to hear from you.  Thanks!

Ever since 2001 I have been dealing with seizures, headaches that would come and go and of course just not feeling like myself. I have been to every ER around my area and along with my normal doctor. Last Friday it was the worse one I had to date, I black out at 8:30am and never came out of it till 12:30pm , while at the ER they told me I had a cyst on my brain and to see my doctor right away. So yesterday I had an MRI and they told me it was normal. For the last 7weeks I am getting sicker by the day. I now have a headache that start 7weeks ago and still has just to go away, tinging in my right side, double vision, blurring vision and dizziness. I seriously been told for the last 8yrs in been in my head and I am making this up but well over a 1000 people have seen me have a seizure and they all have told me someone seriously is wrong with me.  So who do you think I should believe the doctor who says its nothing I am a normal or myself and everyone who deals with it everyday and they see how much pain I am in.

20090128142936AAGxwR6	Health;Women's Health	My last period was 2 days late and now I am ovulating 4 days early WHY?	I can usually depend on my menstruation to begin around 10am on the 29th day of my cycle and then I generally ovulate around 14 days later. However, with my last cycle I was supposed to start menstruating on the 16th and did not start flowing that morning as usual. I did however experience some spotting that night but only about 2-3 drops. Then my period finally came on the evening of the 18th and I had the normal cramping and symptoms of PMS but the flow was lighter in color and consistency and lasted for 7 days instead of my usual 4. Based on expecting my period on the 16th I was supposed to ovulate on the 30th and if I calculate by the 18th instead when my period actually came I was supposed to ovulate on the 1st of February. But, according to my heightened BBT, clear stretchy mucous, tender breasts, slight pain in my ovaries, and my increase in  my sexual appetite(all normal for my ovulation time) I ovulated on the 26th instead! My cycle is very regular and I can usually predict my period to the hour it starts and my ovulation to within about 6 hours but this time I am all messed up! Any advice would be greatly appreciated!

I am a student and I have wanted to lose weight for a long time now, but I don't always have time to get out and exercise during the week. I am already dieting and just want to speed up the process by doing more exercising than I am now. I think the most practical thing for me to do would be to use a treadmill or stationary bike. This way I could exercise while doing homework, reading, or watching tv, and I wouldn't have to leave the house.   Does anyone know of any specific treadmill or bike models that are good to do other things while working out? Has anyone actually lost weight with any exercise equipment? Also, I'm going to have to buy the equipment myself, and I know it can be expensive, so I'm not looking for something with a ton of features. I  just want something that can get the job done well and something that makes exercising more convenient. We have had a couple machines that are suppose to work on the abs, or specific areas of the body, and I haven't ever really used them because I don't really know if I'm using them right, and they don't seem as natural or convenient as a treadmill or bike would.       ANY advice or suggestions would be helpful and I promise to award best answer to a detailed and informative reply that helps me the most! Thanks!

Je connais le r?le de la sensibilité profonde dans le schéma de la marche (perception de la position des membres dans l’espace), quand à  la sensibilité vibratoire  je ne connais pas son r?le dans le schéma de la marche, s’il y a quelqu’un qui peut m’en informer je lui serais reconnaissant.

20081031094850AASCZaW	Health;Men's Health	I have a sexual dilemma, pls help....?	I'm 20 yrs old. In public, I'm obsessed with being a good guy.  I don't look at women and think about sex.  My family is really religious but I like sex and think that it can be very beautiful.      That being said, when I'm alone, I'm a sex maniac.  I have been masturbating like 7 times a day on average for the past two years.  Sometimes I'd go days without wanting to eat, just looking at porn and masturbating.  It has totally taken over my life and makes me feel ashamed of myself in public.  When I try to stop masturbating, I get really aggressive to the point of turning off what few friends and family members I interact with.  Its like I'm living just to think about sex, which isn't living at all. What should I do?

20081022172128AAdrJEh	Health;Women's Health	What is it about unavailable men that makes them so attractive?	Time for another q from me :)       Basically I am referring to a guy I was with for a very brief period (3 dates) a loooong time ago (7yrs ) but he was my first lover in the physical sense so no matter what I do I will remember him (dammit!).  He was cheating on either his wife or girlfriend at the time with me (I found out and ended it - hence the 3 dates only!) - I'm not sure if they were married then or if they married afterwards but they are now - plus their child was born around the time he cheated with me.  So I was pretty hurt by it all, him being my first etc  But I just let it go at the time as I knew that I'd been played and nothing would change that.      What I wanted to ask was -  I know intellectually that no guy is a perfect man for any girl.  But in my mind this guy seems to have all the attractive features a girl (like me) could want: he's cute and scruffy and hardworking and knows how to fix things and be practical, he earns mega $$ and buys and sells property for $mils, he's not educated but very clever and makes good decisions, he's now probably quite the faithful family man after he 'sowed his seeds' with me, he's close with his family and has great friends, and he is funny and lighthearted most of the time, but quiet and brooding when upset about something and he loves to have fun!      I found out most of that about him in the short time we had together and recently a friend told me some more she knew of him (ie he's married to the gf/wife still etc).  And although I have since married my best friend and lover who seems to just fit me, I can't stop being hurt by him and thinking how great he and his wife seem to have it.  Like she got this guy who has it all, and I was just a stepping stone.        I'll try to make my question clearer :) - why does he appear to be such a 'good catch' to me?  I know he probably has problems like everyone else but why is it that he seems to be such a good package?  Is it because I couldn't have him?      Please don't assume I don't love or want to cheat on my husband - that is not the case:) This is just to do with me:)

I could put like 10-15 pounds on and still be healthy for my height.  I've always been short and small. Lately, my parents have been making comments  about my weight or butt.  I told them it's not funny, and that they should stop but they won't.  I go outside a lot.  I go on morning walks, afternoon walks, and occasionally evening walks.  I pull a lot of all-nighters, and there's nothing to snack on in my house, so I've lost a few pounds actually since school ended.  But the comments keep coming.  Like my dad said, "Well, I go out for exercise so my butt doesn't get big."  And then he'll look at me.  And I say, "What?  I go outside every day for hours!"  And he just says, "whatever".  One night I told my mom it wasn't healthy to be eating midnight snacks, and she said, "Get your own weight in order before talking about other people" She's been trying to lose weight.  I've stopped eating now because they make me feel fat.  Idk what to do?

I get so frustrated, but I try to be patient with her. Have you  been in this situation? How do you deal with this without freaking out?       Also, not only does my grandma have alzheimers, but her mother had it as well. I'm terrified, i mean TERRIFIED, that I am going to get it when I am older. I would never ever wish for my family to have to deal with it again. I'm scared of what it does to people, and I don't want to put that on my family!

And you don't really know that you are swinging them. And you are sure the other person is looking and noticing your arms and how they swing. Paranoid.   And you look into all of their eyes that you pass in the hall even though it feels awkward but you want to be kind so you smile and nod. All the while hating this eye contact. But it feels weird to ignore co- workers and to snub them by not saying hi. This last part has nothing to do with the eyes. therefore, is it a sign of weakness not to make eye contact or does it show confidence?

But my question is, how long do you have to be taking birth control for this side effect to happen?  Like, if you just took birth control for 2 months, would it still mess your system up like that?  Or do you need to be on it for at least a year or so?  Thank you!

20090225075824AAx83JQ	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Allergies	Can someone be allergic to Smirnoff but not beer?	I am a very responsible beer lover who is all about trying new flavors and i like to drink it pretty often (responsibly of course). Even though i like the taste of mikes hard lemonade and smirnoff ice, i've always avoided them because when i was younger i would try it and it would make me tired, even though people would find that to be a weird reaction, but i figured it was different for everybody so i didn't pay much attention to it, but if i'm ever given a bottle i never feel like finishing it. Tonight my friend brought over a 6 pack of Smirnoff Ice Triple Black, and i was like "why not". By the end of a bottle and a half (at the time i started writing this), my chest was in pain, my heart was throbbing and i felt like crying. By the time i was putting quotations on "why not" in the sentence before this i was feeling fine again. I do have Celiac Disease in my family (allergic to wheat) but I have never had an allergic reaction to wheat or beer, so i don't know if that has anything to do with it, but I've never even thought of it as an alergic reaction or anything serious until i felt what i just felt. Does anyone know anything about the topic or can anyone provide help on this?
20090225075849AAUraik	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Other - Diseases	Can an under-active thryoid gland get worse over time?!?	Hi all,      I'm going to the Doctors tomorrow to ask about checking to see if I have an Under-active Thyroid Gland. I was tested for it a few years ago and my tests came back as "borderline" so I wasn't treated for it. However, at the time, I was treated for the Depression I was going through. Since then, I've been treated for Depression on & off, but never had my Thyroid checked since. I was just wondering if things could have gotten worse since I was last tested and that I might be over that "borderline" now?      I have all the classic symptoms....lethargic, puffy face, brittle hair that falls out, pale skin, depression, cold hands.      Please help me with some advice that I could perhaps mention to the Doctor tomorrow. I can't carry on like this. It is ruining my life.      Thanks xxx
