It is part of the company's Nseries line of smartphones. The N95's features include standard features of s60 3rd edition platform with feature pack 1. The phone utilizes a two-way slider allowing access to media playback buttons or a keypad, but not both simultaneously.    It was unveiled in September 2006 and was released in mid-March 2007. It is based on S60 3rd Edition Feature Pack 1 software on the Symbian OS (v9.2).    On March 22, 2007 Nokia announced that the N95 had started shipping in key European, Asian and Middle Eastern markets.     On April 7, 2007, the N95 went on sale in the United States through Nokia's Flagship stores in New York and Chicago and through Nokia's nseries.com website. No US carriers are expected to offer this phone.    Nokia N95 handsets supplied by Orange and Vodafone in the UK have had the VoIP facility removed from the phone to the annoyance of many users.

VgxG5YYiaa	Cingular customer service is usually very helpful.  There will always be a few crappy represenatives in every call center.  I have been able to extend my payment date when times are rough.  I just took my 8 month old CU500 in because of a messed up speaker and they replaced the phone for free.  I think as of the merger, all phones carry a 1 year warranty, excluding cracks and water damage of course.  The upgrade policy for existing customers is the same for every provider, deal with it.  If you have paid on time most of the time they will also waive the activation and give you an additional discount on a new phone if you renew.|`|30af74f1a4dc9846e060c07ceceb1de0aa	***** better have my money is how they treat you|`|AA10983636	they are ok, i've been using cingular for the past 3 years|`|670d1476a01b3071483ec334c1c3366daa	I have been on Nextel, Verizon, Sprint and Alltel, all I can say is that cingular is the cheapest for me and blows them all away.  Once the contract is up, you stay at the same rate, or you can re-up with the newest deal.  I have been a Cingular / Att customer for 4 years now and I like it alot (I'm in NC).|`|mC78kjfHaa	I dropped my cell phone this weekend and I went to Cingular last night (after working a 12 hour day and driving an hour and 20 minutes to get to the store) to hopefully get  a replacement. I was willing to pay for a phone, however they told me that because I was on a two year plan I was not eligable to get the "upgrade" so I would have to pay full price on the phone. (their cheapest full priced phone is like 200 bucks) I called customer service when I got home and they said I would only be eligable for the "upgrade" in another 4 months. The worst part of the whole thing is that I have had a plan with them since 2000, and my current plan is well over a year old.     My advise: STAY AWAY FROM CINGULAR. and plus: FEWEST DROPPED CALLS MY A**.

For example, if this were a mustache you would likely have great difficulty in parting with it. You might even decide you want a second mustache, or dare I say, even a third. That's where I  come in. I can get you those mustaches and a lot more. You don't know what it feels like to be a God until you've tried on a fake mustache.     So, to answer your question. Buy a fake mustache and wear it until you are ready to sell your cell phone.     Hope this helped.

AA10983636	Also known as "videophone", or "video conferencing", this feature lets two people with 3G video phones talk to each other while viewing 2-way live video of each other.    Some phones with this feature have a camera that rotates or swivels, so it can face the user for video calling, and face "out" for taking photos. Other phones have two cameras - one facing in and one facing out.    This feature requires a 3G network that specifically supports video calling. It will only work when the phone is in range of such a network. Both phones must also support video calling - not all 3G phones do.|`|UFWaPnbTaa	it like sending a email but in a video like u want to tell some1 u got a new puppy make a video with u and the puupy telling that person that u have one

AA10983636	-battery like is ok at best, keep in mind with so many features the battery takes a beating. I find that I charge it every night before I sleep to get full usage throughout the day.  -GPS works great, however, it takes approx 3-5min to get a GPS signal when you first turn on the navigation gps function.  -wifi is easy to set up and use.  -no slider problems for me  -the slide show feature is easy to use and you can play music at the same time  -so far it has the best sounding stereo speakers on any cell phone I've heard  -5mega-pixel camera is ok, not as good as I though it would be considering its 5mega-pixels  -prices have come down to approx $750 w/o plan or $550 with a plan  - if you plan on using it in the US, 3G will not work because it uses Europe/Asia 3G@1900Mhz. My advice would be to disable it to conserve battery power searching for a 3g signal that isn't available in the US.  All things considered, I like the phone over-all and would recommend it.
e412551d6c02320bcec6f322a94b18bbaa	I'm not. I already have a good phone and a 30GB iPod. I spent less than the lowest asking price for the iPhone for both. Why anyone would spend $499 or $599 for an iPhone is beyond me. My phone(Samsung t629) was $99.99 and I bought my 30GB iPod after the price drop and it was $248.44 at Walmart. So I paid $348.43 before taxes, and have a good phone and an iPod with MUCH more storage than both iPhones.|`|0gEf72hoaa	no because personally i dont like the iphone...i like the idea...but not the iphone itslef    the fact that its only touch screen...sucks...  the fact that the battery cant be removed...sucks...(so incase you battery is plainly dead...you cant change it for another one...youd have to buy another iphone)    the fact that its only either 4 gig or 8 gig makes me just all around by itslef forget about buying it...and also theres no expansion for memory card slots...    and for the price of around 500 to 600 dollars    in my opinion youd be way better off buying an ipod video(30 gig) and a t-mobile dash or motoQ and youd still come up winning...for practically the same price!    even if you just got the dash or Q...you could just stream your music from the internet like i do...i have my music online...and just stream it right onto my phone....and no worries there|`|yYHuTLWOaa	no|`|RWYRqrB1aa	No.  No 3G, no buy.|`|AA10983636	no, i'll wait 'till the 3g version comes out early next year|`|7vUYAsq3aa	no. does not have 3g, has a touch screen (which i'm really afraid i'll break)
NQwURxYiaa	Well the Razr is Motorola and the VX860 is an LG.  It really depend on what one you like.  I really like the design of the LG, but the Razr is cool too. Check out the Krzr if you want to stay with a Motorola phone, and something small.|`|AA10983636	to answer your question, you can upgrade if you've been with your current cell provider for 1-2 years(check w/your provider).  I think the LG vx860 is a better choice over the razr v3

fSJ3lHM5aa	I think the technology can be found in most major cell phone carriers.  I do like how they have a site that integrates the GPS and locator services.  I could care less about the Disney brand name but you will either be roaming or on another carrier's service if youre not in their major metro coverage area.   The innovation from Disney is fantastic; I would love to see them with a big carrier like Verizon.|`|AA10983636	its ok
AA12263513	"Can anyone guess what it could be?"  I'd say it was a logic problem inside the phone      "... and if there is a possible solution ..."  Most carriers stopped repairing phones.  Since you won't be able to open the phone, your only option is to get another one.      "also i would like to know if my fone supports a 1Gb card..." ,   Nokia makes the 1Gb mmc memory for your phone.  Look here:  http://www.blueunplugged.com/p.aspx?p=11...

7Z4vB79eaa	I recently bought an Archos 604 and I can tell you myself that the device is purelly wonderful. The screen is very vibrant and the button only take a bit of getting used to. Three days after I had the device in my posession, I knew all the controls and could easily navigate through it. The photo wall is one of my favorite features, and the stock photos that are already loaded on it are great as menu wallpapers. Video and Music quality is great, escpecially when you can convert a lot of the very nice video types to WMV which is the type the Archos understands. (And MPEG4) You can also use www.javimoya.com to download videos off youtube, and then use the Total Video Converter to convert them into wmv files. Music can be from any CD and everything syncs flawlessly with Windows Media Player. All in all, any Archos player is a great decision for the mainstream consumer. Hope that helped! :)|`|cggWLcwKaa	yes they are good they mainly make media devices though but yeah they are a good mp3 company but creative would be the best choice.

Eo0oeZMTaa	Full price on a storm is 499.99.<br>  <br>  In the past when I was a customer with verizon they would sell you a phone 20% off if you extended your contract from whatever it is to 2 years. That doesnt sound too great but it may not be a bad idea if you plan on staying with verizon.  <br>  <br>  Of course you can always go the Ebay or Craigslist route. There are a lot of gadget junkies out there that like to buy every phone that comes out so you can probably get a good deal  on a used one even with one as new as the storm. I bought a used phone on ebay twice and had no problems. Of course you always want to check feedback,  I usually buy only items located in the U.S.

Like someone else said, it great if you want a flashy phone. But it doesn't have features that some other phones have (ex MotoQ)   It doesn't record video, and I don't think you can play video on it either. You also won't have the myfavs application. You can't upload your own ringtones, like you can do with smartphones, so you'll have to pay for those.    But it really is a very pretty phone. Kind of pricy in my opinion, since you can get phones with more features for cheaper, but a nice phone nonetheless.   Oh, and I think you can only do prepaid...I'm not sure though.

Its got the look and the slimness. have fun|`|t5NXtRODaa	I just got a Samsung from T-Mobile 2 months ago. It's the worst phone I've ever had. It's a Samsung 209 or something like that...it's a cheap phone (my razr died and dad didn't want to extend my contract) but it's a piece. I'd suggest a Nokia. I've never seen anyone have a problem with a Nokia.|`|kH24Iegpaa	Samsung phones are alright. Ive never had any problems with Nokia phones (Nokia 6101 or 6103 are good ones.)    SInce you're gonna E-bay it, look for Sidekick II or III. Theyre good and you can get them at a low price.    The trace is a good phone nevertheless. It has a very nice design.
kH24Iegpaa	The Pearl is better. Its thinner and less bulky. It isn't in the classic Blackberry style but has similar features. The 8700 is really big and bulky. Its only good if you are a business user but the Pearl will still be good for that. The pearl is more popular too.    The Dash is good. I've never owned one but it got good reviews. Go to a T-mobile store and try them out. They can help you send a practice text and make a phone call to test the features.    Im getting the Pearl soon so well see...  Good Luck!|`|c7c439d244d2696deeb630ffb5b50ce0aa	consider your uses & preferences.  8100 uses sure type, does not have full qwerty keyboard, takes some getting used to, but very nice once you do.  Also 8100 includes camera whereas 8700 does not.
kH24Iegpaa	You have to get it unlocked first. Im not sure if thats possible yet seeing as how new it is. After that, you can put any SIM card into it and use it with any GSM carrier.
8514de359341a97221d9a6a65946d504aa	to protest the charges with paypal, they do not guarentee that you will get your money back. i have been fighting with them for almost a year. what you need to do is keep the phone and go to company and explain to them the situation of how you bought the phone and take the reciept to them. show them that you did buy the phone legally and you did not steal the phone. the reason they will not activate the phone is in their eyes you stole the phone.|`|7HEZhx46aa	So basically you bought a stolen phone. If you can't make contact the seller, contact eBay and tell them the situation (complaining DOES get results).  If there's a SIM card in the phone, take it out, go to a legitimate phone store and get one for your own account.|`|Z8B4gBjcaa	You can probably report the seller to ebay and if you paid for it by Paypal you can protest the charges.

LTxBjB5Uaa	buy a modem, should be like $30 bucks for a decent one. Put it next to ur xbox with a short ethernet cable. Hey, sell your wireless adapter on ebay or to gamestop (if you want to get ripped off), or sell it to a friend. You should have no problems. DON'T STANDBY THOUGH! haha just kidding man.|`|hHQIUrNjaa	Its probably because its 360, but could be Verison its still just DSL|`|dkVKLymqaa	Your splitter box, the Fios i guess, is circulating the packets, the internet, evenly across all the computers/laptops/video game systems hooked to it. Unless you have configured the Fios to send the correct amount, or the required amount of packets (MTU i believe) to your xbox, it is going to run really bad, since it is not receiving enough to run properly.<br>       you have to either go on the Verizon site to find out how to change it, or look into the manual that came with it.
L1FUcmb0aa	Well, I haven't used it for long. I practically just plugged it in once and tried a number out. It works pretty well, and you don't lose any sound quality. The con is that I think you have to keep your computer on at all times, and it has to be hooked up to the Internet.

The adjustments necessary are in the link I will give as my source.|`|mu1SyqCLaa	check out dslreports.com for MJ reviews and comments.<br>  <br>  One thing I am sure of is, faxing thru voip isn't reliable so forget it.

What that does is reset the tv settings and the ps3 should recognize the av cables.

42179704f68b09bf27cb0b25a718c620aa	First...where the HELL are you finding these prices...the copper in 7 metre of wire goes for more than that at the SCRAP yard, let alone retail.    Second...no. Custom PC means Custom Prices.    Third...as to your PS...  So...you see two cars on the lot. One a basic model, and the other with $10k in options. According to you logic, the cars should be the same price?    What are you smoking, and why are you not sharing!?    Good Luck!    Incidentally...the main reason custom PCs cost so much more...above and beyond the high-end bleeding edge parts cost...is the man-hours put into the build. If you don't understand then take a look at a generic build, and then look at a Voodoo build. As for the "microsales"...huh? Whether a custom build or a generic build...there are exactly the same number of sales...one per box. Besides, the Custom Builders buy FEWER of a unit item than do the Generic Builders, so if you're considering sales volume, your argument falls flat.    If you truly want a $0 build...do it yourself, if you know how. If you don't, and you have a friend do the build for you, even if (s)he doesn't charge you money, you will still end-up paying for the build somehow.    EDIT: Actually...I read it 4 times...over two days, and wasn't going to answer until I read your "PS." :D As to the pricing... 0.15$ is equal to 15 cents, and copper goes for over a dollar a pound in the scrap yard.

Alienware is just one that has a good rep for good computers and laptops.     If you really want to take the byte out of the cost, you are probably better off to buy a computer from a big box store and upgrade from there or you do what every person that wanted a great computer, you build it yourself.     If you do not know how, you can either learn or find a tech (There are many out there that should not cost much). Then you start piece by piece and you can be sure of what you are paying for. It usually comes out cheaper in the end doing it this way.

There are subtle differences the majority of which are things such as the type of content offered in both stores, the games, friends list, instant messaging etc... and the biggest difference bring PSN is Free, while Xbox Live is $50 a Year.     Xbox Live does not have dedicated Servers and speed is reliant on the host of the game ISP. So I Host all my matches to ensure I experince no lag, and in my 3 years on Xbox Live I never had lag, only on EA Crappy Server's as they have dedicated Server's you switch over to when playing EA games online.|`|sjXgTRauaa	it's a lot more popular with the 360 cuz it's smoother. there are too many glitches with the ps3 right now. so if your looking to set up online go with the 360.|`|CdlSbr0aaa	well ive only played online with my 360 but my brother just got a ps3 but i dont play it because id rather play 360. but the 360 online is pretty fun probly nothing too different from the ps3. but 360 has marketplace and has events examples like you can download game add ons, videos and for events this week you can play ray lewis in madden so thats pretty cool. idk if ps3 has any of that but thats what the 360 has.|`|l0QinWFGaa	i have both a 360 and ps3, i play them both online.  i prefer xbox's online game play.

Only upside ps3 online has is it's free, 360's is not, but stuff that is better always comes with a price...|`|oJJmJTuaaa	The online play is the same.

KLL0Acrwaa	The D80 is in closeout mode right now, so you can get them pretty inexpensively.  At Amazon.com, the D80, body only is $544.95.  I would then suggest picking up a used 18-55mm VR lens off eBay, where they typically sell for around $60.  If you want a second lens, you should get the Nikon 55-200mm VR; I've never heard of a 55-108mm, which makes me suspicious of your seller.  Stick with a reputable seller, even if it costs a few more dollars.  You'll spend more with a disreputable seller, no matter what the advertised price might be.    The D80 body has a few features more oriented towards photographers, like two control wheels (vs. only 1 in the D60) and the ability to set a specific color temperature white balance (no such option in the D60).  The D80 is also more compatible with regular Nikon AF lenses, whereas the D60 is not (you have to manually focus these lenses on the D60).    Overall, I believe the D80 is a much better value and has more photographer oriented features, while the D60 is aimed more at snapshooters who want a digital SLR.  Which one is right for you depends upon what kind of photographer you are.  The D80 will give you a bit more room to grow, but both cameras will give you excellent images.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	Canon rebel xs|`|e9f790d77a3b3a69de567374bd8e389aaa	For the price get a d40 with second lens for about 75 dollars less.  Also there is no 55-108...  only seen 55-200 on nikon site|`|HBNx77BBaa	If you want some strong and well-reasoned opinions have a look at Ken Rockwell's camera review site. He'd tell you to save your money and get a D40 in preference to a D60. He also reckons the D80 is history. He has his own style, but he makes his case well...    http://kenrockwell.com/nikon/d60.htm    Edit: Mentioning Ken Rockwell appears to score an automatic two thumbs down round here! See what you make of him.|`|e76f94644ba717d14e758eb9252c03a8aa	It's better to get a body that cost less and many lens with it.  Lenses hold their value for longer.  Plus when you are ready to upgrade your camera in a few years you can take the lenses with you, the body will be out dated.    A 55-108mm doesn't seem like a whole lot of range.  Maybe get a 18-200mm instead of those two lens, or a 70-300mm instead.|`|gcDY8iqnaa	Buy the D80 if you plan to buy or have older Nikon AF or AF-D lenses becuase the D80 can work with them in addition to AF-S lenses and the D60 (as well as D40x and D40) can only be fully functional with newer Nikon AF-S lenses.    If you are starting from scratch the D40, D40x and D60 are excellent values. IMHO the 18-55 and 55-200 are excellent lenses.

uFSDEo9Uaa	Let's talk about downloading FREE music the right way.    P2P (Peer to Peer or file-sharing) software like LimeWire, Ares, FrostWire, IMesh, BearShare etc., while popular, are risky in nature, slow and virus-prone, besides the fact that they slows down your computer.    If you want to download music fast, free, secure and safely go to:    http://searchformusic.eu.pn/    It's a specialized, free, powerful search engine for finding music to download for free.     It searches many (80+) carefully-selected direct-download virus-free sites that doesn't require you to log-in nor register.     There you can find pieces or even entire albums and then download-it without downloading any software nor other complications.     It's free, accurate and safe, but a little tricky, maybe you have to learn how to use it but the site explains all you need to know in order to find and download music. Once you learn how to use this powerful search engine, you'll find -and hence could download- almost anything you want, forever!    Because it's Google-based, you can use for your search all the power of Google, like using entire phrases enclosed in quotation marks, make use of AND, OR, and - (for excluding words/frases), etc. Then in just one powerful search you look at more than 80 music sites simultaneously!      Good luck & happy downloading!|`|YG3DQLC0aa	hey if you want to download music then try using http://www.kptunes.com where you will always find your favorite music with the best and good quality sound tracks. i have been using kptunes for a while and i always find my favorite songs. they have the largest network and huge database for each and every music you want from any artist of your choice. this is the best site i have ever seen.|`|BPZ4sGLnaa	Go to http://www.flickrmusic.com and start downloading music/movies right away. The excitement our family shares for music is now truly unlimited thanks to the incredibly easy-to-use Music Downloads Membership.|`|eUdk3VUvaa	You can try http://searchformp3s.net  You can download straight from there or you can just listen to the music from there.    No need to download any programs, just download the mp3's directly from the website!|`|Q0dzzgomaa	I would suggest that instead of downloading from Rhapsody, Napster or Limewire, you use the Free Youtube to Mp3 Converter from www.dvdvideosoft.com for the following reasons:    1) Sharing  - With limewire, they want you to share the songs you download and the songs you have. Now you can turn this option off, but who wants to sit there for hours siftingthrough thousands of options for the sake of a couple of songs? With the software I recommended, you don't have to share sh*t (Excuse the language)    2) Preview before you play  - With limewire, you have to start downloading the song before you can preview it. Now this might not sound like a problem to most, but for people with super fast internet connections that can download songs at the speed of light, you won't have the time to preview it before it plays because it would be on your computer before your mouse could get anywhere near that play button. Now suppose it's a virus and not the song you wanted? You see, Youtube of course lets you play the video (they don't expect you to download, so playing the video is the only thing you can do), which not only allows you to check and see whether or not it's the right song, but you can check its quality as well.     3) Virus Risks  - See, Limewire downloads from other people's computers meaning that they could've downloaded that song from anywhere. So it could potentially be a virus. But ask yourself: when was the last time you heard about Youtube having a virus? Youtube performs maintanence nearly everyday, so even if they were to get a virus, they would detect it before it could do any serious damage to the site itself.  Plus, this is Google, the masters of coding/programming. Hell, they probably made their own anti virus software to scan the videos before they're actually uploaded. You have to realize: Google is a huge company. They wouldn't let some bad computer code cooked up by an amateur hacker destroy something they paid over $1 billion for.     4) Settings  - When you download Limewire for the first time, you don't automatically start downloading music. You have to first configure what seems like thousands of unnecessary settings. These range from turning it on and off as your torrent client, to the quality, to what types of files you would like to share (why is that even there?), to settings that talk about proxies (you're probably thinking "What the hell are proxies?"). Basically, it's too much of a hassle for those of us who simply want to download a couple of songs. Well, with the software I suggested, you only do four things:  - Install  - Select the folder  - Select the quality  - Download your songs    5) Wider Variety of Music  - True enough, Limewire, Napster and those other sharing sites have a pretty large collection of songs, but when it comes down to it, Youtube is the biggest. Admit it, every song that you couldn't find on Limewire or iTunes, you could easily find on Youtube. Not only new generation songs, but songs from commercials and old/new TV Shows, 80's hits, classic rock, Def Jam Poetry, exclusive remixes, underground rap, extremely rare tracks that you thought you would never find. You're in luck especially if you listen to Hip Hop or Rock simply because of the huge amount of remixes that can be found on Youtube. Most of which can't be found on Limewire, and certainly won't be found on iTunes. But you're thinking "I don't know how to download from Youtube!" Well, now you can.       Now, for my last point (I'm almost done, stay with me), I would like to emphasize what I stated about sharing. Now even though Limewire claims to share only the folder you told it to, you have to understand the immense amount of skilled hackers there are. You see how people who have never even heard of Limewire get their computers hacked every day, and Limewire damn near provides the tools with all of this "folder sharing" business. Plus, Limewire shares your IP Address (just like torrents), which is basically the key to your internet connection. Basically, this program kicks Limewire's ***, but in case you need further proof, let's weigh the advantages and disadvantages:    Free Youtube to Mp3 Converter:    Pros:  1) Shares absolutely nothing, not even the IP Address. You're not required to share with anyone else.    2) You don't have to configure 1000's of settings as soon as you start the software (as you do with limewire). You just pick the folder you want to save it to, and then start downloading    3) No viruses.    4) Preview before you play    Cons:  n/a      Limewire:  Pros:  - You can download free music    Cons:  - Everything else    Now as I said before, this software is completely free, and can be downloaded from www.dvdvideosoft.com

iLDX1eiVaa	-Instead of having the slug EDGE network, the 3G iPhone uses a 3G network.    -It is a different shape and feel, and it's made of plastic.    -iPhone 2.0 firmware (App STORE!)    -Headphone jack    -Price    -GPS      I wouldn't get a 3G if I were you, because it does basically everything a normal iPhone could do. For the GPS, you could use cellular towers. And you could download the new firmware for free and get the App store, etc.    So unless you are a hardcore Apple geek, I would say it is NOT worth it since you already have an iPhone.|`|jKkbfm59aa	www.att.com/iphone    while your looking around on it on the website you might want to click on the common questions    but its worth getting the new one|`|upAf4ysEaa	3g will basically bring the speed up to almost that of wi-fi    also there is GPS, and the back cover is completely different and in black or white)    cost is $200, 300  monthly base cost is $70|`|G67lZxwIaa	half the price twice as fast..worth switching with old iphone...i don't think so ( also main screen will turn when you hold the phone vertically.)|`|qijxFQ2Raa	My mom had an iPhone before, but just this morning she bought the new 3G one.

Also the other difference the WIFI is faster, but you have to be in a Free Wifi space, like a starbucks hotspot

You shouldn't worry about breaking or overcharging them.|`|ub23m7Praa	It used to be that you just charged until the battery was full..    But that was on the old batteries that didn't automatically stop.    Now you can keep them on the charger all the time and they will charge until the battery is full then they just sit there not charging or anything.|`|LRbM2cXhaa	If you still have the phone instructions look it up there.

Si no tenias seguro anexado a la linea, tu unica preocupacion es denunciar la linea para que no te lo usen los ladrones, y no se en que pais estas vos, pero aca en Argentina, junto a la denuncia de robo, haces el pedido de chip del numnero robado, asi recuperas todos los datos que tenias ahi guardados.|`|U7eB2W98aa	te doy un tip, cuando tengas un cel tienes que marcar * 06  sin marcar send y te va aparecer un numero de cdigo ese numero recuerda lo para cuando reportes a tu compa?a el celular perdido des ese numero y los rateros no puedan usar el cel ni con otro chip.|`|173f73d091a7ef03c76e214e00967696aa	Exacto, al haber cambiado el chip, al menos en Argentina, si el chip estaba en x telefono, y lo pasaste a z telefono, te cancelaran el chip y te pondran en banda negativa(te lo cancelaran) al telefono x, donde es originario el chip. Lo que debes hacer es explicar la situacion, diciendo que vos cambiaste el chip de lugar, que eso que hiciste es totalmente legal, y si no quieren hacerte caso, deberas denunciarlos al ombudsman o defensor del pueblo, ya que estas en todo tu derecho de hacer lo que quieras con el chip.

Hope this helps  if its not that call the apple company and they should be able to help u|`|qijxFQ2Raa	First make sure that the iPod is not on hold. Or "Lock" as others call it. Then hold down the Menu button and the center button until an apple can be seen on the screen. You may barely be able to see it at first, but the screen will light up soon after that. From my experiences nothing should have been deleted.
qijxFQ2Raa	Go to Settings and turn Shuffle on. You can choose to shuffle Albums or just by Songs. Then go to the playlist you want to listen to and select a song.|`|QYZgIIEHaa	yea  just go to settings and turn shuffle on
qijxFQ2Raa	It depends on whether or not you have 'Manually mange music' selected. If you don't, I'm pretty sure the songs that are not in iTunes will be deleted. If you do have it selected, then just click the songs you want that are in iTunes and drag them to the icon of your iPod and it will sync the song to your iPod without deleting anything. Don't press Sync, or your songs on your iPod will be deleted, all of them. To select 'Manually manage music', go to the iPod summary and click the box that says 'Manually manage music'.|`|r27XAUsQaa	everytime u use diff computer to sync itunes.. music. its gona get erazed.   if u use the same computer then nothing gets deleted n u can add songs into it|`|VULMn14Aaa	Yes.

If they are on your ipod and then u remove them from itunes music, then you can keep them. But if you put them on from another computer, they will likely be erased.

0i5dn4ryaa	Ok well I don't know if it's illegal to give advice on the topic of pirating, so here goes:    First off I'd need to know how you acquired the zip.  I really try not to download anything that's a zip file as I'm on windows, but I'm guessing it'd be fine for a mac user.    Next, you should try to use a bit torrent client in order to locate and download these huge files.  After you do that, I would recommend you use a bit torrent search website (just do a google search) in order to find the ISO you need in order to play the game on the PSP.  Hopefully your PSP is modded because if not this would be all for nothing.    When you have the game downloaded you either need to have a zip file extractor or a .rar file extractor.  Once again just google search as I don't know program names that would work on mac.    Lastly, I would recommend downloading a CSO as they are much smaller than an ISO or use a program that will compress the files.  Do all that, hook the PSP to the computer, transfer the file and you're good to go.    To Note:  Usually this method does not result in a .zip file.  You can usually find files that are either .iso or .cso so you won't have to worry about converting a .zip file.|`|kfZ66olcaa	You need an ISO if you have CFW already, and in that case you need the original to rip the ISO or own the original to legally procure a copy of one via a P2P site.    Though as it stands, a zip file would do little for you as that's just a compressed file...
kfZ66olcaa	Not sure about the second part, but to use the learning function, simply go to the IR remote and hit start then create new :)
NhV6lDsBaa	i think that LCD from LG is better than plasma from LG  i went to the store and compared them while i was looking for a new tv|`|d6d6ba532d5982bcf991fac313dd88a1aa	LCD's have improved leaps and bounds the last few years.  It is pretty much going to be THE display technology now.  The new models have a color depth that can stand toe-to-toe with the best plasma.  Plus, they're not susceptible to high-altitude distortion either.    As for DLP - you got me there.  I use a Sony LCD rear projection...and it's fantastic as long as there's no sunlight coming into the room.  As soon as I pick up a new 46-50 inch LCD, the rear projection TV's going straight to the bedroom.|`|qHEpR92Gaa	Well this is the perfect TV for you  http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d...|`|UYMbj4rvaa	I like the LCD better. Its more sleek and lighter. DLPs use a bulb and you have to change it every now and then, and a plasma uses gas which fades after a while.
AA11134471	If he is coming out to install it, then I would think you already bought the equipment, or they were going to give it to you anyway.    You can install the dish yourself, and I suppose you can ask him to just leave the dish and all of the cables and stuff, but the test equipment will NOT be left with you. Not that you need it to do the install, it just makes it quicker.

Hope that helps.|`|dc60ff3b5aa807768088e0759e3df6b5aa	Hello,    (ANS) You need to find out who makes the XDA Orbit pocket PC operating system (OS) and also who makes the software version 5. My guess is that you should be able to download any available upgrades from the makers website (they probably have one).    No.1 Check to make sure there IS an upgrade?    No.2 Check to see what new features or functions any upgrade might have BEFORE you do decide to install the upgrade.    NOTE:- DON'T automatically assume that just because there is an upgrade available that it will be better than the version you already have.    MORAL OF THE STORY IS:- NOT ALL UPGRADES MEAN A BETTER PRODUCT. Some upgrades can be dreadful and not worth the effort involved in installing them. therefore my advise is proceed with great caution.    Hope that helps?    Kind Regards Ivan    computer veteran.

OxxspMkIaa	The Original Xbox and the Xbox 360 Both access the Same Network we know as Xbox Live, So yes you can still get on line with the Original Xbox, you just need to have a Gold Subscription, you can even play against Xbox 360 owners who are playing the same game, so some of the people you play against in Halo 2 may likely be playing it in their Xbox 360.    Xbox Live was Started November 2002 three years before the Launch of the Xbox 360. This will be it's 7th year in service.|`|gP7XSy9paa	yeh but not as much people will go on it  like there will be hardly any 1|`|AREAqfSJaa	do you own a 360? just pop it in your 360 if you do.    i haven't tried my regular xbox in like 3 years man haha|`|jzh9PHm0aa	Yes you can.

70a43707807dc9900f19f111a38b3d42aa	You mean the album art right? Well I don't have an ipod nano but a video ipod but I'm assuming it all works the same. If you got your songs off Itunes, they all should have album art. If you got them from Limewire or some other music sharing/downloading program, only some sources will have album art attached with the songs you download.In any matter, you add or delete album art anytime. Just right click on a song and go to Edit and you can edit the name of the song, add or delete album art, anything.Hope that helps!|`|bec111088377d6c632075a679082f858aa	on itunes do view then show artwork|`|h9eEvgqhaa	Some songs just don't have one , it might not be your ipod.

You click that, and it should make the album artwork appear.  If it's already checked, then it's probably that the song just didn't come with album artwork, or it could be a off a CD, in which case it just wouldn't be available at all.|`|3z9xiX6Waa	when you plug your ipod nano into the comp. to sync it , it will say display album artwork. and it may jsut be the song or whatever that doesn't have the pic like if you got it off a cd or somewhere else but if you right click the song that doesn't have album artwork then it  says get album artwork. and thats what does it for me!!|`|Z1arv0CIaa	This happened to me too, if you just pull off your iPod when its connected to your computer and don't safely disconnect it, they might stop showing up.  To get them back, if you have the latest version on iTunes, click on the tab that says music and see if the box that says 'display album artwork' is checked.    hope that helps.|`|lUGTFS7caa	just make sure all of your songs have correct title, artist, and album. then go to advanced and click get album art. after that is done you should have all of the album art. now sync your iPod with your computer. Good luck ; )

AA10983636	Although there are several types of "locks" that can apply to a phone, the most talked-about type is a carrier lock, also known as a SIM lock or subsidy lock.    Many phones sold by carriers come "locked" to that carrier. A "locked" phone can only be used with that carrier; it cannot be used with another carrier's service. (Not counting roaming.)    This lock can usually be removed by entering a special code or numeric password. In some situations, some carriers will supply this code upon request by the customer; not all carriers will do this.    There are also third-party companies that sell such codes, or other types of unlocking services.|`|bd5Lu0W2aa	Well this is how it works. A sim card that is GSM will only work for a GSM phone and so on.     A phone is locked because carriers don't want you to take the phone you got from them to another carrier. So a Cingular phone will be locked to their sim cards only, you would have to unlock it to have a T Mobile card to work in it.    Your Your phone can accept any sim card from the same carrier, if it is unlocked then sim cards from another carrier will work.|`|XCKIPjduaa	CDMA phones are generally phones that do not require a sim card whereas GSM phones require a card    Verizon & Alltell = CDMA  Cingular & T-mobile = gsm    if you buy a phone from cingular chances are if you try to use that phone on t-mobile's network it will not work unless the imei (phones serial number) has been unlocked so that it can be used on other gsm carriers.     it keeps people from buying a phone from one carrier and using it on another carrier, it is generally why you buy your phone from the cellular carrier and not directly from the manufacturer.    also if you have an "unlocked" phone and are trying to use it on a carrier other than the original one the messaging and other options may not be programmed correctly, oh and chances are the new carrier will not be able to offer support for the unlocked phone    hope this makes sense

They're not neat or attractive and you can't switch between devices using the remote, but it's the only solution I'm aware of.
AA10983636	It will launch this summer as the V8 for GSM/EDGE networks, the V9 for HSDPA and V9m for EV-DO.     V8: features quad-band GSM/EDGE, Motorola's new Linux/Java platform including new user-friendly features and a full HTML browser. Includes 2 GB of built in memory but no card slot. It is 12mm thick.   V9: thicker than the other two models but adds noise cancellation technology, a microSD slot and video sharing. However it uses Motorola's older "Synergy" platform. It is expected in late summer with quad-band GSM and HSDPA 850/1900 for the US.

ddd2b272975c49eb0b349a665e1d92eaaa	Yes definitely, the Philippines' uses the most common and internationally used band, the frequency used is GSM 900/1800. Depending on where you will be in the country, 900 is normally in in urban areas and 1800 normally in rural/provincial areas. These are the 2 GSM frequencies in the Philippines.

AA10949589	Try getting "real player"  I know it sounds too good to be true but my sandisk sansa m260 actually did the same thing and thats all I had to do.  GOOD LUCK.|`|PyZM0vBjaa	Try this for windows XP machines. What happens is that XP does not assign the drive letter like c:\ d:\ to the Sansa fuze thats why its not seen in the My computer page, so we have to manually assign the drive letter. This is from official MS page    How to change a drive letter  To change an existing drive letter on a drive, on a partition, or on a volume, follow these steps:   Log on as Administrator or as a member of the Administrators group.  Click Start, click Control Panel, and then click Performance and Maintenance.   Click Administrative Tools, double-click Computer Management, and then click Disk Management in the left pane.  Right-click the drive, the partition, the logical drive, or the volume that you want to assign a drive letter to, and then click Change Drive Letter and Paths.  Click Change.  Click Assign the following drive letter if it is not already selected, click the drive letter that you want to use, and then click OK.   Click Yes when you are prompted to confirm the drive letter change.  The drive letter of the drive, the partition, or the volume that you specified is changed, and the new drive letter appears in the appropriate drive, partition, or volume in the Disk Management tool.

Double click on the downloaded file again, if it opens in another program, you need to set the default media player to iTunes. Do this by going to the start menu and selecting select program access and defaults. Make sure that you have custom selected, you should see two little arrows on the Left side of the colum. Click the one in line with Custom, where it says Default Media Player, make sure that iTunes is selected. Then press OK.     If it still isn't working, maybe you downloaded the file in the wrong format.

AA11286886	Chris Villarin chrisvillarin.com Photographer Artist Web Designer Digital Video Effects Editing in Manila Philippines    I wrote this long answer, from years of experience editing. This is not copied from any website. Hope this helps!    TRANSFERRING VIDEO FROM CAMCORDER TO COMPUTER    Camcorders usually come with connecting cables. Older camcorders have yellow, red and white RCA cables that connect the camcorder to your TV or in this case your computer. Newer camcorders have FIREWIRE connectors that conveniently connect to FIREWIRE connectors in newer computers be it PC or Mac.    FOR CAMCORDERS WITH RCA CONNECTORS & PROPRIETARY CONNECTIONS    If you are using a camcorder with RCA connectors then your computer must have a Video Capture Card or any kind of video capturing device connected to your computer. A webcam is not a video capture device.     RCA connectors/cables come in 3 colors, yellow for video, red and white for left and right audio channel. In some camcorders you will see the 3 outlets with the 3 colors. While other camcorders are provided with a proprietary outlet that needs a proprietary cable with RCA connectors on the other end of the cable. These cables usually come with the camcorder.    Make the connections on the camera and connect the RCA to the outlets of your Video Capture Card/device. Color codes on the RCA and the outlets are important. The yellow RCA is carries the video signal and should be connected to the "video in" outlet of the Video Capture Card/Device. The red and white RCA cables are the left and right audio signal. These can be swapped without any problems.    Sometimes the camcorder has a minijack or headphone jack for outputting sound. And, sometimes the Video Capture Card/Device also uses a minijack to capture sound. If this is the case, only the yellow RCA cable needs to be connected both to the camcorder and the computer. Use a minijack to minijack connector cable to connect the camcorder and the computer. The minijack cable replaces the red and white RCA cable. There is such a thing as a "Y-Cable". The Y-Cable is a minijack on one end and 2 RCAs on the other end. You can use this if the camcorder and the Video Capture Card/Device have different ways to connect audio signals. With all these complexities you don't have to worry about connecting the wrong cables because NOTHING WILL BE DAMAGED in case you make a mistake.    Once the connections are done you are now ready to capture the video on your computer. Video Capture Cards/Devices come with programs that allow you to capture video to a location in your computer. Captured video files are most of the times in .avi or .mpg format stored in your computer.    FOR CAMCORDERS WITH FIREWIRE CONNECTOR OR (IEEE) 1394 CONNECTOR OR i.LINK    New camcorders and new computers come with FIREWIRE or 1394 Connectors. These are more convenient to use. All you have to do is connect just 1 Fireweire (1394) cable to the camcorder and the computer. Turn on your computer and make sure all the programs that need to load during startup have been loaded. Connect the camcorder to the computer using the Firewire cable. Turn on your camera and set it to "play" mode. Not "record" or "camera" mode. Your computer should detect the camera and prompt you to open the associated program. Open the program and look for the "capture" button.    CAPTURE SETTINGS    Leave everything on default and you should be OK. Once you get the hang of it you can start tweaking some settings. Here are common settings that you might want to experiment:    Resolution - this refers to the number of pixel. A 320x240 resolution means 320 pixels horizontally and 240 pixels vertically. 320x240 is the advised capturing resolution for youtube videos. 352x240 is ideal for VCD. 640x480 is the ideal resolution for full screen computer videos. 720x480 is the ideal resolution for DVD.    Data Rate - refers to the amount of data allocated for capturing video(and audio). 300 kbps (kilobit per second) in mpeg-1 format is recommended for youtube. 1152 kbps in mpeg-1 format is for VCD. 2,000 kbps in mpeg-2 format is recommended for DVD. These numbers are here as reference. You will get a low quality DVD if you recorded in 300 kbps mpeg-1. Commercial DVD data rate is 4500 kbps in mpeg-2 format. Data rate also determines the file size of the captured video. The lower the data rate the smaller the file.    Compression - MPEG 4 is for ipod videos, MPEG 3 is for music, MPEG 2 is for DVD, MPEG 1 is for VCD. DV compression is the highest quality compression available to standard desktop/laptop computers. If you plan to capture a video for editing I suggest you capture in DV compression .avi file.    MAKING DVDs    You make DVDs by burning the DVDs in a DVD burner drive. DVD+R and DVD-R are now interchangeable types. Most commercial DVD players can handle both types. Open your DVD burning program. Most of the time DVD burners come with programs to make DVDs. Just follow the instructions on how to make DVDs and you're done!|`|Nl0JQYWqaa	rip the video with HandBrake.

Next, your phone will ask what profile to use, and you should select 'Data Transfer' or 'Mass Storage'. Finally, transfer your music files (be it MP3, M4A or WAV) to your phone's memory card (considering that your phone does have a memory card).    You can also use the memory card on to a card reader if you dont want to use a USB Cable. Just buy a cheap memory card reader, remove your microSD memory card and put it in the card reader.

AA11322322	Depends on the context you mean!    Radio frequencies can overload other circuitry nearby and cause unwanted effects.  This is Radio Interference!  For example you are using a badly screened HiFi unit and a taxi-cab transmits from close by... the transmission might be picked up by the cabling and comes out the HiFi unit, but as this was unintended it is Interference!    In terms of radio, R.I. is where another signal is on the same frequency, a very close frequency, or is giving out harmonic-radiation at a frequency that is the same as the one being monitored.  In such circumstances the Receiver is unable to produce the desired output due to this Interference!    The situation can be even more complicated in digital communication, since whole frames (or even packets) of data might be lost causing drop-outs.  Thankfully, most digital communication sends many redundant and duplicated packets, so loss is minimised!    Hope this Helps!...            `|`|eiJOdPgxaa	Interference that breaks up the radio waves - they go from being horizontal to wiggly.|`|LepOqaN4aa	I think: A frequency similar to the radio's frequency is too close to the radio and thinks its on the same wave.

4268GvlVaa	Yes you can use a Pre-paid Cingular Phone with a regular Cingular service sim Card. Don't worry it does work but you just have to buy a new sim card aside from the prepaid phone to reactivate your regular service sim card.    No , you don't need to have the pre-paid phone unlocked.  The lock they put on the phones if your other companies like T-Mobile etc but not for their own even if it is prepaid.    What to look out for is nothing.  Sometimes they give the sim card for free , just ask the salesperson they could.  Worse situation , they would charge you for the sim card for $20-25.      Next time I would recommend putting Phone Insurance on it. Cingular offers it for $4.99 per month.    Hope that helps.|`|AA11714804	I do that with TMobile.

QDB1UFWjaa	No, not right away.  Its too expensive for one.  Also, apple has a habit of bringing out new models with updates very rapidly.  Its not 3G compatable which might hurt it.  Now its a plus that it gives you the full web as we see it on a computer.  However if that is too slow, its not going to be very popular.  The other thing Im not a fan of, is that it is only a 4 or 8 gig player in either model.  For 600 bucks I'd like more memory.  Not gonna store a lot of video or high res pics on that.  Also, if it doesn't have a good battary (hopefully they learned from the iPod) its going to flop.  It has potential, but Im not willing to say it will just yet.

uw3J8M0waa	And then there are rear projection LCD's and DLP's which use mirror panels and color wheels to filter and project a very large screen image [ranging from 65" to 72" diagonally measured]. The major concern is replacement cost of lamps which usually cost between $200 - $300 and last any number of hours depending on how the TV is shut off. Failing to properly shut down either LCD or DLP units which involves leaving on the main fan running for some 20 minutes -- will result in early failure of projection lamps. And there's the added concern regarding the use of "organic" material which make up the LCD panels/mirrors and usually causes the blue panel to fade over a period of time. So you may have to look forward to purchasing a new LCD projection TV. But getting back to DLP projection TV, there is the issue of viewers seeing the dreaded "rainbow effect" which are color flashes appear in highly contrasty dark scenes. Their sighting can cause headaches and is quite annoying to the viewers. And a possible cure is to choose a color wheel which operates faster than 3X; say 4X which seems to be the threshold speed that virtually eliminates the rainbow effect.    And finally, we should also consider the "ultimate, best" TV technology: "Front Projection."    You may well want to check out another technology: DLP front projection which produces a movie-like experience of HD television, DVDs, videos and games. And according to Consumer Reports, "front projection has a superior image -- better than CRT's, LCDs or plasma."    Good luck!|`|rYZqvYsHaa	There are two types of LCD TV's  one uses a backlight behind a flat panel  data is sent to a horiz and vertical grid    the other uses small 1" LCD's 3 of them  a white light source is split by prism and   red green and blue are used as backlight source  the image is magnified and then reflected off a mirror    DLP is similiar to a projection LCD but much different  the white light passes thru a rotating color wheel  the image is produced on the face of a very special IC  it looks similiar to a computer microprocessor  the face is millions of small mirrors that act like an LCD  they go dark to make black dots and shiny to reflect the color  As the color wheel rotates the image on the face of the Mirror IC changes  the image is also magnified and reflected off a mirror    there is also another form JVC calls it HD-ILA   rotating slits in the light path alter the phase of the source light  adding more realism to the displayed image|`|AA10983636	LCD is a brighter/better picture and cost few hundred$$$ more|`|rzoTdW7Baa	DLP stands for Data Light Processing, you can do a search on Wikipedia with the keyword DLP    DLP projectors have mirrors that display each pixel giving a clearer image|`|XtaWTK8iaa	View for your self the link below all I can say is WOW.
8e3cc6d7a159a8a4ca1c3346046739dcaa	Sorry, but its not possible to have the camera in Landscape Mode on the N70. The problem is that there is no symbian application that works in landscape mode on S60v2.    I recommend you read through this forum-  http://www.symbian-freak.com/forum/viewt...|`|AA10983636	the nokia n95 does landscape
kH24Iegpaa	Yeah. I had prepaid 2 years ago and I did the same thing.
VbpPmof7aa	Apple will fix it for $250. I broke mine, too, and did some research online. I found a DIY kit also for $75, but it was listed as extremely difficult to replace yourself.|`|qijxFQ2Raa	It probably depends on your warranty. You probably want to check your warranty at apple.com and see if you can get it repaired.
j5Apt8hWaa	If you don't want to use the program that came with you Canon to process your RAW files, you will have to down load this Plug-in from Adobe    http://kb.adobe.com/selfservice/viewCont...|`|6644da85d010d98c8e75bdddc3c55c49aa	You can also download their (free) Adobe Digital Negative converter. You would use it to convert all your RAW files into DNG files, then PS CS2 can import those DNG files. It works in batch mode (a few clicks, walk away and after a while it's finished).
HrlxbqZmaa	SHARP LC37D44U is only 720p but its very hard  for the human eye to see the difference in this size of screen|`|1eXxGForaa	The max resolution of the component cable is 1080i, if you don't have an HDMI output you can get the xbox 360 VGA cable. If you are going to buy an HDMI cable buy it on ebay.com, cables are cables and you wont see a difference between a $10 cable or a $100 monster cable.
GDgV3XKgaa	posting the model no would help.if ur portable dvd player has audio video OUT(red white and yellow) then hook av cables from thr to the IN on ur tv.
EsdqLD9Saa	If I were you I would consult a pro, maybe from the sony website?
r2P6PtAOaa	Sony Vegas 7 or 8 is a fabulous video editor.    It's really expensive, though, and a bit hard to master (do keep in mind, however, that what you have in mind will take a long time to execute properly in any video editor--the editing there takes a lot of time).     Anyway, if you don't want to buy that, there is always uh... well, how to put this discreetly? Youtube has... links for it ;P|`|VWcqTzYHaa	i cant think of a software, i made a music video with a couple of cousins of mine for a birthday and we just had to record it and then cut and paste the clips we wanted and put them together in moviemaker or the software that the macs have i think its i video?|`|QCJ27QJyaa	pinnacle studio 12. it supports 2 video tracks. you can video yourself singing in 2 locations and line them up together, and simply delete which parts of which u do not want to have and the other track will play under it. if you need more than 2 tracks do the same thing and then copy and paste into where you want the new tracks.  idk if that made sense, i'm really tired right now, sorry  hope that helped
l47z8bFfaa	Ok I have mobile as well with my cell phone but because of the area I am in I get a lot of lag with the internet signal. The best thing I can say is this call mobile and ask for their support team and don't tell them what kind of phone you have but ask them why your internet service is having these issues. They will my guess 9 times out of 10 they will reset your APN so that you shouldn't have the problem of being kicked off. Or the other thing is ask them why your phone is lagging and how come it keeps kicking you off and then ask them is their a trouble spot in your area.|`|lJAaBmlyaa	The slowness of the internet might be because the iphones 3g frequency bands are different from tmobiles so you are only going to get and edge signal
rTlWyR6eaa	I had a long, researched answer for you.  ******* IE.    Anyhow, 4GB RAM is plenty, but your motherboard supports DDR3 and you have selected DDR2 RAM.      Your motherboard's sound will be just fine.  It even has digital optical and coax outputs so you're covered.    That keyboard/mouse combo is not something I'd recommend for gaming.  I use it on my media PC hooked to my TV and there is a bit of lag even just navigating through explorer.    Also, what OS are you planning on using?|`|GcpLsdA2aa	All is fine but you'll find that mouse + keyboard will lag, watch out :)  2x 9800gt is what you want. have fun|`|TtxkbLRdaa	If your willing to pay for it then yes, that is very good for gaming.  FWI, that video card is getting a little old unfortunately ( I have one level below that one lol).  Not sure about the  sound card, mines built in on the motherboard, and that RAM should be fine to play any game.
HFuI8oVYaa	If you want good video quality, use a good video camera. They start at $2000 and go up in price quickly. The under $1000 video cameras for home use will do OK and will be way better than any still camera with a video function. Still cameras with a video function produce sub-par videos and are difficult to set up for recording audio. When I shoot stage shows, I use a $2500 DV video camera (considered prosumer, e.g. really low-end pro, high-end consumer) and use an external audio mixing board so I can capture house audio for audience reaction and  reverberation. I also take a tap off the theater's mixing panel so I can capture a clean music track and microphones that the stage people are using. This requires post processing to make it all sound right.    Then, get a good still camera, preferably a dSLR with an APS-C sized sensor or larger and decent lenses. You can start out at $400 for low-end dSLR cameras with a kit lens, $2000-$3000 to get a decent camera body with a full sized 36mm frame sensor and spend lots more money on lenses (some lenses will cost around $200 and can go over $4000 for a big telephoto lens). A low-end dSLR will produce much nicer images than any point & shoot, especially when shooting in low light situations.    The trick to those Hollywood movies and nice magazine ads is all about lighting. You can have great camera equipment and produce crappy images because of poor lighting. Lighting will make or break your images. Whenever I set up photo sessions for product photography, 80% of the time is setting up lighting, cleaning and orientation of the product, 20% for shooting.    Someone else will need to answer costing issues on strobes, soft boxes, lighting panels, reflectors, and other goodies of the trade.    Oh, and don't forget about makeup for your subjects.    Then, you need to take courses, read, and practice.

f9f69d2b2e17038ff738ee1a664fdb22aa	1. To upgrade a CDMA phone, the carrier must deactivate the old phone then activate the new one. The old phone becomes useless.    2. Very less models are available in the CDMA.
zLyuKci0aa	hi mini,    please prefer NOKIA set it has sound battery back up, and a lot other facilities which the ERICson has insted battery back up.    and Nokia has good stylish phone sets, u can choice...............    Thank U    Arta
JzYlcuXzaa	That wouldn't be possible unfortunately because the iPhone works on a GSM network as opposed to Sprint which works on a CDMA network.  What's the difference?  GSM (AT&T and T-Mobile) use sim cards, Sprint/Verizon use IMEIs (no sim cards).  Sorry bud.
R7vE8IwRaa	I am assuming you went here http://www.htc.com/www/SupportViewNews.a...    Well I don't want to answer saying that you are putting it in incorrectly, however I should say this I work for a Wireless Carrier and most customers tend to put in this information incorrectly, but I should also say that if you still have your box, you will have several barcodes here including the Serial Number. If you don't have the box then the best I can suggest is that you have one that starts with HT then put 14 characters and if you have one that starts with SZ then put 17 characters.|`|OhTPygYlaa	You should have WM 6.1 and it is the very latest. 6.5 is in the works but it will still be some time before it is released. But...  You will be very happy at what you find at;  http://wiki.xda-developers.com/index.php...  and  http://forum.xda-developers.com/forumdis...  Hope that helps.
bkkO2uw0aa	radio shack has everything you will need. you can also try hardware stores
xTioPxaVaa	A pirate version of a pirate movie?  I love the irony there.    There is software that can remove vocals from music, and it might work in this case.  But, it will also remove most of the dialog as well.  You'll pretty much just wind up with the special effects and the music.  Those programs work by removing the audio that is in both the left and right channels (which is usually the voice).  Anything panned to the left and right gets through to varying degrees.    In spite of what you see on CSI, there's not an inexpensive way to remove (or isolate) voices on a recording.  I could do it in ProTools, but but I would have to charge you a whole lot more than it would cost to just go buy the movie.      I did a vocal elimination on a very old mono recording for a lady that just had to have it for karaoke (the vocal elimination programs only work on stereo sources).  For a 3 minute song, that took 4 hours.  My rate for this type of audio surgery is $105/hour.  I could have almost hired a band and rerecorded the song for that kind of money.    Save yourself the aggrevation...buy the movie.    Greetings from Austin    Ken
AA11148143	You have a noisy line, duh. Call Repair Service and report it; they will fix it for you. No charge if the problems is outside your house, which is usually the case. Water gets in where it shouldn't and corrosion makes a high resistance, and voila! noise.|`|Z7ZE1lAJaa	Before you call the phone company check your service with a non cordless phone at the network interface box at the side/rear of your house first.  This could save you a trouble isolation charge if you do not have a maintenance plan.|`|AA11256390	Try this link for BT's website. It's for line fault problems. As far as I know you can report a fault online and then track it through so you know whats going on with it. It does sound like you hav a faulty line as opposed to faulty phones. The link is for you to troubleshoot first to try different solutions and basic things to see where the fault lies then there is the option to report it online or call BT  http://bt.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/bt.cfg/ph...
OosO8xxcaa	Hey- I believe Verizon would be able to block those certain numbers for you. My aunt said she's called them before and those calls stopped. You may want to double check with a customer representative. They also may give you a website to block those calls. Goodluck! Hope this helps!|`|3yvuMkzTaa	Call customer service, they will help you out!!!
ajcnZQL7aa	i understand i and i dont know why they did that on rock band it should be a chain of yellows then a red cause yellow is hi hat for everyother song, not red. i think it may have just been a mistake but yes its wrong|`|3vJoA7bzaa	Well I guess it's because GTH WT pays alot of money to make the game so they make people play it properly.|`|uRGNjWF9aa	They probably did this so the notes would be worth more on the meter on the side, because the reds and oranges are worth double, making it harder.
