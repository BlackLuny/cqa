20090202141442AAFeMjk	Computers & Internet;Security	Trojan help! Why is this happening?	I have Norton PC scanner, Avira, and Superantispyware.   I was scanning with Norton and it said that it had a virus..trojan.zlob.   Then I scanned with Avira and it said I didn't have anything..I also scanned with Superantispyware and deleted everything that came up then scanned with Norton again to see if the virus went away.    Does this mean I have it or I don't?   I know where it's located because of Norton..but I can't delete it by right clicking->delete.       If I do still have the virus, how should I get rid of it?    Any help would be GREATLY appreciated. x      Btw, please don't post copied answers or answers you aren't sure that will work.       Thanks! ;]
20090202141504AAOpWmO	Computers & Internet;Security	My computer deleted my user account with ALL of my information on it, please help?	Well, i have windows XP on my HP, and it has been running fine for quite some time. I have been using the user account that comes with it, Administrator, although i have changed my password, and all of my settings to personalize it. Yesterday my mom asked me to make her a user account for the computer, because mine was pass worded, so I made her one. While making it, i noticed that i could not click limited, only Admin (it said you must have at least one admin) I didn't think much of this at all. I completed it and for the rest of the day things were fine. When I got on the computer today, my account was gone. All of my files, personal settings, the account no longer existed, it just sent me right to her's. All of my work from the past year is in there and i NEED to find a way to get it, i tried a system restore, but it said nothing was changed. Please help!!!

20090202141656AAzQBKm	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Add-ons	Why won't my Computer read my SD card?	I have a micro sd card with the card adapter for my phone and I'm trying to get songs on it.     In order to plug it in my first computer I need the imagemate. (which I have) I know the imagemate works because my other card for my camera goes into the slot next to it and it uploads videos fine.     If my sd memory card for my phone is in the imagemate adapter thing when I plug it into the usb port then the removable disks won't show up. I tried putting my imagemate adapter in first so the removable disks would show up then put my sd memory card in. When I do this and click on the removable disk it says the disk cannot be accessed do to a I/O device error. I tried going to manage disks and device on my computer but nothing seemed to work. I thought something must be wrong with that slot in my imagemate adapter.      Then, my other computer allows me to just plug my memory card straight into the computer. I don't really need my memory card on this computer because all my songs are on my other computer. Anyhow, the memory card worked and I put one song on it and then took it out. I tried to put it back in and it failed to read card or show any sign that there was a card in there. There was no error message or anything. The card works fine.     WHAT DO I DO?

20090202142643AAE8dDE	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Add-ons	GeForce 5200 Game Crashes?	I tried a web search, and maybe I'm not specific enough to find a useful answer so I hope someone here can help. My computer is a number of years old, and all I know about it is that it's got 512MB RAM, a 2.4 Ghz AMD XP processor. I added a nvidia GeForce FX 5200 Ultra to the AGP slot. Also, the mother board is nForce 2. I would think everything would work together nicely. I have the most recent drivers. Now, when I play ANY 3D game my computer will randomly crash.      The screen will show diagonal lines about .5 inches wide, repeating and filling the entire screen. The lines have the same colors as the scene does just before the crash. My audio will loop every half second for about 4 seconds, then will go silent. The only thing I can do at this point is power cycle my computer - control, alt, delete does nothing.      The games run smoothly right until the crash. I'm suspecting a hardware issue, but maybe someone can offer me some solutions that won't cost me any money to try. Thanks.

20090202143002AAYWyuY	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Java is percentage of fat less than 30% of calories?	I have java program for school I am confused with and need help, as I am bad with math. It should be simple to understand for any programming veteran out there.      The user enters the number of calories for a food item (any food item or drink). They then enter the total grams of fat for that food item. The following calculations are performed:   // Calculate the data   fatCalories = fatGrams * 9;   fatPercentage = fatCalories / calories;      Now where I am confused with... the program has to determine if the percentage of fat is less than 30% of the calories entered. How do I do this? Should it be:   if (fatPercentage < calories / .30 * 100)      Or should it be:   if(fatPercentage < calories / .30)      I've been testing this with items I know are high in fat, such as ice cream and it keeps stating that the items are low in fat when they are not.   I should note, I am using the double variable data type for all the variables. The first two calculates are what the book said to perform so I assume they are right, I just need to be able to find if fatPercentage is less than 30% of the total calories entered.

I need to count how many 1's did AB get, how many 2's did AB get, etc.       After all of this, I'm trying to get a weighted average for AB.

I have a Samsung CLX-2160N, and is a laser printer. I just bought the printer less than a year ago so it has been kept in good condition.     Thanks a lot!

20090202151827AAW8Z3x	Computers & Internet;Software	Where can I find a free, downloadable, unlimited FLAC to MP3 conversion program?	I've been looking for a lean, efficient program that can convert FLAC to MP3. It has to be FREEWARE, it can NOT be a trial version, there should be NO registering involved, and it has to convert the WHOLE file (not 60% or less like certain programs I've encountered)      I've tried All-To-Mp3, and it was a good program but my trial expired on that. A program similar to that would be nice, but anything that fits my description is fine. Oh and, it doesn't have to exclusively convert FLAC to Mp3, as long as its free and includes a .flac to .mp3 converter, it's exactly what I'm looking for.

The Computer:       http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?...       I figured I'd need to upgrade the graphics card for sure.      Anything else, is the processor ok?

I'm not somebody that needs a gigantic (Like a TB) HDD anyways, plus I'm getting a portable 160 Gig for Music/Movies, and I only  have 40 gigs of Music/Movies so I think I should be good on space...      It comes with Vista Home Premium, which I guess is better than XP, right?      I guess my only worry is the processor, so can somebody ease my troubled mind? XD

So anyway, I went to my comp this morning, and there was this pop-up from firewall. It said that I had this trojan/worm/virus in my comp, that works as like a keylogger and it takes screenshots. So there were three buttons. 1. Keep Blocking (I couldn't click this button) 2. Unblock (I couldn't click this button either.) 3. Enable Protection (This was the only button that wasn't "dark" It was the only one that was 3-d, its hard to explain. Anyway, this morning I pressed enable protection. I can't remember but the comp might have reboot itself automatically. Then when I came back from school, I logged in and the pop-up/alert was there again. Before I could even click anything, the comp reboot itself again. Is this a virus? What should I do?

20090202183229AA2xisW	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	I have a question about my computer?	I have completely customized my PC. I have a Nvidia 9800 GT card, 4 GB ram installed (vista detects only 2.5 gb), Intel Quad-core 2.4 Ghz cpu, 500 watt PSU, and P5N-D mobo. When i put my mobo on high power, i get insane game performance but i always get the BSOD (blue screen of death) crashes. When i put it on low power, my performance sucks but there is no bsod's. I know its not overheating issues because my gpu is at 60C when its running heavy software and about 47 on standby. 1 of my friends said i need a larger watt psu, but my other friends disagree.    So the question is, will getting a new PSU solve the bsod problems, or is this just vista problems. I didn't have any bsod issues when i had my old gpu, cpu, psu, and mobo.

And I've also noticed that if I'm on myspace and it's the only tab open and I try to open yahoo mail, the computer will no doubt freeze up and not let me get into my mail.     Could this be an indication of some sort of virus? If yes, how do I find it and get rid of it without downloading software? I'd like to just remove it manually.    It's a Vista if it helps.

For a class project I am working on a new Canon image press c1+ printer that has the capability to print using clear toner so it adds a really cool effect, but I cant figure out how to use illustrator to maximize the effect. here are the steps I need to take to print a creation that as some objects in clear toner only   1. I need to have a colored background so I just made a rectangle the size of the window and filled it with dark blue   2. I picked a symbol and had to change the entire color to a spot color that I named ( this spot color name tells the printer not to print this color, but to put clear toner down instead)   3. I went to print the page with my original objects and my spot colored objects, and the clear toner went over the exact spot where I put the spot color, BUT here is my problem... this area was white instead of the same color as the background. I have tried everything I can think of.

Thanks!!
20090202165752AAIjeN2	Computers & Internet;Software	Help with uninstalling program (Protools)?	The program is protools. I can't open it all of a sudden so I want to reinstall it but the problem is I can't even uninstall it. When I try to uninstall it, the status bar of its completion is a smidge from the end and the step it always gets stuck on is configuration or something like that.. I left it there for about 5 hours and it didn't finish. The program shows up active in the windows task manager (CTRL-ALT-DELETE menu) in the processes part. It runs in safe mode too.       What happened? What could've made this happen? Any way for me to get rid of it or to fix it?

I have run avast! antivirus, avira antivir, spybot search and destroy, spyware terminator w/ integrated clamAV, and spyware doctor all without success. Would doing a system recovery remove these viruses? I mean a system recovery that restores it to factory condition not a system restore.      Thanks,   Michael

I installed a software -a perfectly legal mainstream language learning software I bought from amazon- which is supposed to only need 500MB but maybe it blocked because I started and stopped defragmenting the hard drive a lot of times today.

I tried disk cleanup but it doesn't work it only saves me about 200MB.      What can I do? What's wrong with my hard drive and how can I fix it?      thanks in advance.

20090202202422AA10e6o	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Buying a laptop help?	Okay, so I recently bought a Sony Vaio VGN CS-190, and it's not what I hoped it would be. It's 2.0 ghz intel duel processor, 250 gb harddrive, and 3gb ram. My problem with it, is that it is very slow and I worry it is all flash and no performance. I'm not going to lie, part of the reason I bought it is because it was pretty.     I'd like a better performance computer that still looks nice, maybe a HP I want it to have at least 2.4ghz processor and a good graphics card because I really want to play sims 3 when it comes out. Do you have any suggestions    oh, and I like fast start up, and a quiet computer. The vaio has a LOUD fan     10 points to the best ideas!

I believed the easiest way was to use NetStumbler, and set my router to each channel -- then look at the SNR graph.  Unfortunately, it won't work on Windows Vista.      What's the easiest way?  Is there a equivalent program that can run on Linux (Ubuntu)?  Whatever it is must be user-friendly because I'm primarily a Windows user.            My laptop has an Intel 3945abg wireless adapter and runs Windows Vista.  I have an Ubuntu 8.10 CD but don't know what I'd be looking for and NetStumbler can't run through WINE.

20090202202554AABtarB	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	Is getpaidto.com Safe To Use?	First of all- I noticed that a person asked the same question nine months ago. That's the reason I'm asking it myself, to make sure that the website hasn't become an ultra scam or something insane in that nine month span of time. First of all- I know scams exist. That is why I'm asking it here before I even attempt to sign up. If you are going to drop by just to say it's a scam and that I shouldn't do it, you are wasting space. If you have actually signed up and used the website however, then feel free to give your full opinion on it, and be sure to answer with a very blunt response to joining or not joining. I was also wondering if they want my phone-number, and a little info on PayPal. As in, if they did put the money into PayPal, would I click a button that makes it so that PayPal sends me my money? I don't know how PayPal works. Thanks!!!

Whenever I turn my PC off for hours at a time and then come home to turn it back on it'll start whirring and the blue tint will go on like it normally would when starting up but then it'll turn back off.

I can take out the plug for about a minute and reinsert it and it'll work again when I turn it on but it's not reliable. Obviously something is wrong, but I can't put my finger on it. It's overclocked and so I figured it isn't getting enough power. Every time I up the wattage though it does the same thing. Can someone help me? Thanks.

My computer started to have lag and was starting to freeze here and there so I decided to just use my built in system restore to factory condition.  That usually works for me but after I went through the initial start up procedures this time the mouse froze immediately.  Not good I thought, I took off the side panel of my computer and checked the fans and even put a house fan up to it and nothing changed.  Now it sporadically will either work or not work depending on the mood.  It always starts ETC. but the mouse freezing, page lag, and typing lag are most common. Task manager will not come up with cnt.alt del.  Restarting does nothing for it.  Any questions please ask as I would love to throw this thing out the darn window.  It is a five year old compac presario model sr1033wm.
20090202204658AAYLEhO	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Other - Hardware	Motherbooard/PC combo help?	I currently have an amd 64x2 3800 and am looking for something better. I need a board that will support up to 4 gigs of memory. I am looking to spend under $200. My current board needs replaced because the 4th memory slot is fried. So I figured rather than just get a new board i would get a faster processor. Any help would be appreciated.

20090202143213AAqjhdl	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	  Why doesn't this 'a tag' work in Firefox?	I have two   tags that link to an internal file on my c drive.   In internet explorer both links work fine (a local html file, and a MS Word doc file)      However, in Firefox, the link to the local html file works fine, but the link to the MS word doc 'freaks out' a little when I click on it and I get a pop-up prompt asking where I want to save the file to (the file I am trying to open).  This is whacky, because no document is open and therefore there is nothing to be saved. Just out of curiosity, I changed the title of the file to be saved and found out that it duplicated the file I was trying to open.  Very strange. I tried restarting the computer also.
