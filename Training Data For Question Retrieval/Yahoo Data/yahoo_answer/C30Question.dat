I think that we should take out their nuclear weapon, because we know where they all are, and treat them like we did Afghanistan when we first invaded. that would be a major blow to the Taliban, possibly end the major war faster, and most importantly let every country know that the US does not sit lightly on countries that harbor or give in to terrorists.

I have a friend who gave up her parental rights up to the father of the child, she loves that little boy. The story: In September of 2003 she had a stillborn baby. After that she lost it, she began doing drugs, just to get rid of some of the grief and to be able to live and breath again. She was a mental wasteland, couldn't ge out of bed and tried to kill herself. She couldn't deal with the grief. Her son already lived with his dad, she decided it would be in his best interest to stay with his dad, until she could heal again. In all of this her sons grandma, who is a pushy, nasty witch told her she HAD to sign her rights over so they could get all his medical shi* in order. My friend was in such a pill induced fog, due to the drugs, and the mood stabilizers, and the anti-anxiety pills she signed, thinking she was giving her son a better life without her in the way. She cleaned her act up 2 years ago, in the two years she realized that she was taken for a fool. These evil a**hole* refuse any type of visitation. Can she take their sorry a**es to court and get her rights back again? Because of the situation she was in?     I don't want to hear your opinions on how awful of a mother she WAS or how stupid she WAS. She has since changed her life and she is a wonderful mom to her now 6 year old...

20090219174409AAojR74	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	A petty thief steals some jewelry and a car and gets 2 years. Allen Standford steals $9 billion and walks free?	So a petty thief steals a car, maybe robs some drug stores or gas stations, breaks into a couple of homes and steals, let's say $20,000 worth of goods.  Then let's say after he's suspected he flees to another state making him a fugitive.  Once caught,  he's treated like scum and frowned down upon by society and will probably get anywhere from 1~3 years in prison.      Allen Standford, a Texas billionaire, allegedly defrauds upwards of $9 BILLION dollars, and is found later in Virginia, which makes him a possible fugitive.  He's only served with a civil suit, not criminal and isn't even arrested.      Why is this right?        Let's be clear here; when you defraud someone, you are absolutely stealing money from them.  You say you are going to do one thing with the money and instead do something else with it for your own personal gain or profit at the expense of others.      A petty thief who steals $20,000 will be arrested, jailed, and stigmatized for life and good luck after you're out of prison an ex-convict!      If we apply a jail sentence using the same ratio of money stolen to years in jail as the petty thief, then he should spend at a minimum of 450,000 years in prison.  Now obviously this is obsessive, but clearly he should be put in jail for 20-30 years to life.      Why is it when a common thief steals, they are almost guaranteed to be arrested and jailed, but when a wealthy, "white collar," person steals, defrauds, and cons people they aren't even arrested?  If they do get arrested and convicted, its maybe 10 years in a nice, cushy, jail for white collar criminals?        What happened to equality under the law?

Before you call for my head...this is a hypothetical question:      For those who are on death row, what would you think of offering a sort of option for life (so to speak). Give the option of going through with the sentence...or, being exposed to AIDS or "given" cancer, and using them to test for cures or treatments. If after being cured, they will be set free, or have their sentence commuted to life.      Note: I am not suggesting forcing anyone into this, but giving them this option. Do you believe it to be unethical either way, or could they provide valuable medical advancements for the rest of the world?

Before I met my boyfriend, he was dating a woman that was fairly manipulative. He foolishly lent her 1800 for her tuition. He later bought her a purse for 250.  Neither of them signed any papers detailing how she would.  They verbally agreed that she would pay him in full by July of 2009.   However, 'Becky' as I'll call her, is not a very nice person and has been harassing both of us. Alan and I recently moved to a new city together so he could pursue school and I can better my career. She won't leave us alone!  She sent one of her friends out to talk to me to get info, and I didn't realize what this friend was up to (since it's a friend of both Becky and myself from the past) until just recently. This friend of hers has recently threatened me. We want both of these horrible people out of our lives, and would get them out if Becky didn't owe my boyfriend the 2 grand, which we could really use right now!  Is there any way that we can legally get her to make payments without high lawyer's fees?  It would be wonderful to never have to deal with her and her friend again!

There is, in theory, nothing whatsoever stopping them launching a nuclear attack on one or all of their neighbours--and getting away with it, if they duly trot out the ubiquitous "Israel has the right to defend itself" afterwards.      What about Adolf, as the UN's Envoy? Does he have the experience necessary to deal with it? Could he sort the situation out, to everyone's satisfaction? What do you think?

20090203111747AAS9L23	Politics & Government;Government	It seems all public servants R tax cheaters. Should Obama audit all current & past high-level gov. employees?	Geithner, Daschle, Richardson, the list of cabinet nominees with "problems" keeps growing on a daily basis... Not only should all "public servants" be audited for tax evasion; they should also be audited/probed for abuse of power, abuse of trust, illegal enrichment, etc. Thanks to Obama's new standards for vetting and probing cabinet candidates, many government employees are being found out to be cheaters and probably crooks. I'm sure HRC owes or owed/backpayed her big share of taxes (just a s she owes some $6 million to vendors and others), but Obama didn't want tu publicize that, to avoid scandal.    If Obama really wants to draw the line and begin a milestone administration, he should immediately order both the IRS and the Attorney General to stard auditing and probing ALL high-level public servants (including congress and judiciary, not only the executive branch). And this investigation should include even former government employees, such as past presidents and their cabinets, as well as the legislative and judicial branches. I would love to see people like G.W. Bush go to jail for tax evasion at least, if he is not going for abuse of power; and so many people who have enriched themselves illegally. All the money collected (even just a fraction of it, like 10% for instance), could easily be used to solve the mortgage, financial and industrial crisis, restore the faith of consumers and the faith and trust in government. So, what do you think, It seems all public servants R tax cheaters. Should Obama sign an executive order to audit all current & past high-level gov. employees? If not, why not?

20090219182524AA43wxK	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Being taken to small claims court over gifts given to me for my baby?	My ex and I broke up a few days ago. We had been dating about four months. I am 36 weeks pregnant and he gave me a stroller and baby swing for christmas for a total of around $400. I never asked for or expected these things.      When we broke up he sent me a text stating I could "buy" them from him. Later when I didn't respond he texted "nevermind I'm going to sell them."      I had a key to his place and I went today to gather my stuff that I had there as well as return the keys. He was not there and I got my shoes and CD, as well as the two christmas gifts. I left the keys and went home.      Later when he got hom he called and left a message that he's going to file a police report because I "stole" the baby items from him.      I didn't respond and a few hours later he sent a formal email "attempting settlement" that the items were "Originally purchased as a gift for your unborn child..." and asking me to split the exact cost of the items and I I didn't pay him he would take me to small claims court.      I broke up with him two weeks ago for a day and during that time offered to give him some money for them through text.  He wrote "it's not about the money I don't want to lose you" back.  Can he use the text to say I was supposed to pay him even though we got back together and he admitted they were gifts today?      Does he have a chance? He has no children of his own and admitted in writing they were a gift.

20090219175315AAhL1wc	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Question about Child Support and Court. Please Read....?	I have been receiving child support from my ex husband for our 5 year old for the past 2 years. When we divorced we agreed that he would pay me $650 a month for support and every month he paid me on the 1st with no problems at all. I have full custody and he only has visitation. The visitation is not court ordered, so there is no set times, dates or rules. He is in the Army and calls when he comes back to our home town demanding to see her. I always let her go, but I do put time limits on the visit. He got married a few months ago to a bartender that he knew for 3 weeks. He met her while she was bartending on a weekend he was here and supposed to visiting our daughter. Anyways, sorry to get off the subject, after he got married he called and said he was having financial troubles and told me he was going to start giving me $400 a month because $650 is way too much. I told him that I was going to open a case with child support so we dont argue about $$ and they can come up with a fair amount and no one can change it because they are having financial troubles. So I opened a case and I just got the paperwork back saying that he will have to pay $711 because that is the fair amount that child support came up with. In the paperwork there is all the stuff my ex filled out and there is a typed letter he attatched saying a bunch of lies about me. Saying that I never let him see our daughter and I dont answer the phone and I only put her in name brand clothing, it is all untrue!! I am very upset and I am afraid it is making me look bad.       So my questions are do you think the judge will make him pay the $711 when we go to court next month or do you think he will just look at the letter and not care about what my ex is sobbing about? I dont want to cause drama by saying he is lying because everyone I talk to says just sit back in court and dont say anything because your ex will make a fool out of himself by talking about nonsense. I have never been to court and I am scared. I am so afraid that he will try to get half custody because he has threatend it before. Should I say he is lying or does the stuff he say not even matter? He also said in the letter that my little girl calls my husband because I make her, and my daughter has NEVER called my husband dad, she calls him by his first name. So he is just making stuff up to make people feel sorry for him so he doesnt have to pay as much and I am worried they will believe him. Thank you, sorry it is SOOOO long!!!!!

20090219181055AAuLIwP	Politics & Government;Elections	Compare the advantages and disadvantages of the electoral and popular voting systems?	ok i have no clue how to do this its due tomorrow for government it only has to be a paragraph...10 points! please :) heres the article           AP Photo/Bob Bird       NEW YORK, New York (Achieve3000, February 10, 2008). In the 2000 presidential election, the majority of American voters chose candidate Al Gore for president, but the presidency went instead to George W. Bush. Why did this happen? Because even though Gore won the popular vote—meaning that more individual voters had voted for him—Bush won the electoral vote. In U.S. presidential elections, it's the electoral vote that matters.       So what exactly is the electoral vote?       The president is selected by members of what is called the Electoral College. Each state has members in the Electoral College. These members are called electors. The number of electors assigned to each state is equal to the combined number of senators and representatives that state has seated in Congress. This combination of leaders is also called the state's congressional delegation. In most states, the candidate who wins the majority of a state's popular votes receives all of the state's electoral votes.       Now, critics of the electoral system are calling for reform. They believe that the winner of the national popular vote should become president. It should not be the winner of the electoral vote.       John R. Koza is chairman of National Popular Vote, Inc. His organization is campaigning to have the outcome of presidential elections determined by the popular vote.       Koza and other critics of the electoral system voice several concerns. One concern is that in the electoral system, some states are simply ignored by presidential candidates. For example, if the Democratic candidate is assured of winning a state, the Republican candidate has little incentive to conduct a campaign there. The Republican candidate would focus instead on larger, elector-rich states. Another concern is the prospect of a result like that in 2000. One candidate might once again receive more votes overall, while the opposing candidate wins more votes in the Electoral College.       National Popular Vote asserts that a reformed presidential election process would remedy these issues. The organization is proposing that states forge an agreement. The agreement would modify the way they distribute presidential election votes. States would award their electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote, regardless of who carries each state. Koza believes the proposed agreement would standardize the way states award their electoral votes. It would also give every voter equal influence.       Supporters of the Electoral College system, however, foresee problems with the proposed agreement. Currently, when state election results are very close, the state must re-count all of the votes to ensure accuracy. Some people claim that under the national popular vote system, a close presidential election would require difficult and time-consuming re-counts throughout the country.       Those in favor of the Electoral College system also say that it is a more balanced system. They say that it gives more weight to the votes of states with fewer citizens. A transition to the popular vote system, they claim, would reduce the influence of small states. It would, they say, actually yield the same problem raised by advocates of the popular vote. Candidates, they claim, would focus only on states with larger populations.       Lawrence Klemin is a North Dakota state representative. "Any way you look at it, I think smaller populations have a greater voice under the current system than they would under a national popular vote system," he said. Klemin voted against his state entering into the National Popular Vote's agreement.       Governors in California and Hawaii have also opposed legislation endorsing the national popular vote plan. Arnold Schwarzenegger is the governor or California. He said that the reform would take away from individual states' rights.       Other governors, such as Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich, are expected to endorse the proposal. As a member of Congress, Blagojevich co-sponsored a constitutional amendment to abolish the Electoral College.

They only use they're feelings and not logic and reasoning. They're as clueless as this stimulus bill."
20090219181927AAr8ijx	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Do I have this correct?	Alright, someone please clarify this for me.............        Now let me see if I'm getting this straight. Everyone is blaming this economic depression we're in on the housing industry. The main problem is that people with scores in the 500's and even the 700's, used an Adjustable Rate Mortgage to buy a home that was only a fixed rate for 2-5 years. They used an A.R.M. simply because the rate was usually 2-3% lower than a fixed rate, therefore making a mortgage payment more affordable. The idea behind these loans was that the housing market would appreciate more and more each year, which would allow those borrowers to repair their credit, and be able to refinance their home into a low FIXED rate before their payments adjusted. Now, those people who were irresponsible to begin with didn't make their payments on time, and the bank is foreclosing on their homes due to too many missed payments. This forces the housing values to decrease within a certain neighborhood/area instead of appreciating because the banks are selling the foreclosed home for pennies on the dollar. Now, multiply that by the millions of irresponsible people using A.R.M.s to buy a house, and we have a national crisis. Remember, this is what I've been hearing on the news for the past couple years now. How Mortgage Brokers and Banks were lending out money to people who didn't deserve it in the first place. Which, I must agree completely that the banks should have never lent that money to people who can't even keep up with their Nimo or Time Warner bills. Regardless of whom to blame, I think we can all agree that this is basically what happened to the real estate market in the U.S. Now, there are millions of "homeowners" out there who can't keep up with their payments, and who are upside down on their mortgages because their house is worth less than what they owe.        So, what's Obama's big plan to fix this you ask??? HE'S GOING TO USE OUR TAX MONEY TO PAY THE BANKS INCENTIVES TO GIVE THESE IRRESPONSIBLE BORROWERS, WITH 500 SCORES, WHO HAVEN'T MADE CONSISTENT ON TIME PAYMENTS FOR ANY OF THEIR BILLS FOR YEARS, AN ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGE FOR 5 YEARS FOR 105% OF WHAT THEIR HOUSE IS WORTH!!!!!!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?!?! Am I the only one seeing that he's using the same exact formula that has destroyed this market to try and fix it?? Someone please get back to me on this an tell me I'm wrong. I'm seriously getting tired of bashing my brains with bricks to see if this makes sense if I drop my I.Q. by 100 points.

"War to the hilt between communism and capitalism is inevitable. Today, of course, we are not strong enough TO ATTACK. Our time will come in thirty or forty years.

They will leap at another chance to be friends. As soon as their guard is down, we shall smash them with our clenched fist." --   (Dmitrii Z.

We won’t have to fight you; we will so weaken your economy until you fall like overripe fruit into our hands."        TheirSecrets.info

This is the third bailout coming out of Washington DC, that I am going to have to pay back, that does not assist me in anyway.

Despite income ranging from $210,432 - $321,379 over the ten-year period, the Bidens have given only $120 - $995 per year to charity, which amounts to 0.06% - 0.31% of their income. [...]      It is jarring that a couple earning over $200,000 per year would give as little as $2 per week to charity. This giving compares very unfavorably to John McCain, whose tax returns show that he gave 27.3% - 28.6% of his income to charity in 2006-2007. During the same period, the Obamas' tax returns show that they gave 5.8% - 6.1% of their income to charity.      Perhaps the Obama-Biden campaign needs a new slogan: "Change You Can Believe In (As Long As Someone Else Pays For It)"      Update: Independent Sector reports that 89% of American households contribute to charity, with an average contribution of $1,620 -- 3.1% of income.       IRS statistics reveal that the average taxpayer with AGI over $200,000 makes over $20,000 of charitable contributions.      Wow. The average taxpayer with AGI over $200,000 gives $20,000 to charity?

20090220183829AAD8G29	Politics & Government;Politics	Will the double standard ever end?	In my school when we do research in the library they have the mps blocks on certain sites for pornography..etc; however, we are doing a report for American history on the 1920's - 1930's and our groups assignment was the rise of the kkk; however when we try to find good information; including the official site naturally it's blocked for hate speech and racism purposes... understood. But why is it when i go to the new black panther official website and read things like      "We want full employment for our people and we demand the dignity to do for ourselves what we have begged the white man to do for us.   We believe that since the white man has kept us deaf, dumb and blind, and used every “dirty trick” in the book to stand in the way of our freedom and independence, that we should be gainfully employed until such time we can employ and provide for ourselves."      "We want education for our people that exposes the true nature of this devilish and decadent American society"      "We want all Black People when brought to trial to be tried in a court by a jury of their peer group or people from their Black Communities, as defined by white law of the Constitution of the United States."      Are these not as racially and radically charged as the kkk; they are both terrorist groups setting our country back many many years, but why the double standard? Why is it not blocked under categories of "extreme" "racism" "hate speech"? Would that be racist if we did?      This is an open discussion I am interested if anyone believes these double standards will end, such as racially charged scholarships, racially charged months of the year, and affirmative action! All opinions and criticisms and open and expected as this argument has many sides.      Will it ever end? Is it truly racist?       http://www.newblackpanther.com/platform....     http://www.newblackpanther.com/home.html

I haven't had a ticket in 8 years and just today I received a ticket for something that seemed like a technicality.      I was making a right turn at stop light, but I entered the turn lane before the white lines on the road actually started to appear - by only like 30 feet before the white lines.      The cop gave me $110 ticket for passing on the shoulder!  The road was paved where I was - not like I was driving on the dirt or in the ditch to pass someone, I just got over to the right sooner than the white lines appeared on the road.      My jack russel was sitting in the passenger seat and I'm surprised I didn't get some type of bs ticket for that.

All the while the guy you want to hate in their "community" has undertones of being a capitalist, claiming that the people that contribute the most and seek out food should receive more food per serving. Of course they make him appear to be a complete A-hole, but then again this is from leftist Hollywood.      And I thought it was funny that one of the socialists liked FDR, who was basically the first American socialist president. Maybe not in name but definitely in action.

Ann Coulter was interviewed on Larry King last night, with Joy Behar substituting for Larry, and she completely made Joy Behar look like a fool! Joy of course, hates Ann with a passion, like many liberals do, and tries her best to attack and discredit Ann, but there was NO contest here. Joy seemed flustered throughout the interview and perplexed by Ann's vocabulary and historical references. Even Joy’s “comedic” skills were like a dull bowling alley shoe compared to Ann’s Marine high-gloss dress shoe. Joy tries to flippantly laugh things off, but she's not too convincing. She even, at times, seems nervous…dare I say scared? I think if someone is going to interview Ann Coulter, they ought to get someone who is at least on the same intellectual and educational level as her, don't you think?    People may hate Ann for her bluntness and outspokenness, and they can keep caling her every insult they know, but there is no denying that the woman is smart as hell.

Does this mean a true reflection of how well his bill works would be that with 14-18 months we have 3.5 million people suddenly unemployed when the money runs out.

The 4 men have 2 years experience each, none however have college degrees.      Now, you are supposed to be hired based on your merits. What happens when the boss does not like women and will not hire her simply because she is a woman? Remember, the one with the most merits should get the job. What happens when her merits weren't even considered? How would you deal with this situation?      And if you answer, "well, she should go some where else for a job", are you turning away from the fact that she was discriminated against?      REMEMBER, AFFIRMATIVE ACTION NO LONGER EXISTS.

Since everything needs to be fair, and we have no reason to have GITMO anyways.      Why would we keep him there? The other prisoners that are there have also taken up arms against UN Forces and want to see the fall of the US and democracy.

This is serves as a check and balance against the amount of loans banks can make. When the central bank artificially price sets the interest at below market levels, too much lending will take, leading to an artificial boom followed be a collapse.      Source:   mises.org

Taxing the wealthy sounds great to so many because they are not, but when government takes away the the freedom of someone to decide what to do with their property (including the money they EARNED), we should all worry.

They are looking at the bills from the city to decide which ones to pay.  What!?!    What is this world coming to when you can't trust a City that has been Democrat controlled for at lest 72 years?  Or is it simply that the Dems don't particularly like paying bills?         http://www.suntimes.com/news/politics/ob...          In late October, Mayor Daley assured that the cash-flush Obama campaign would reimburse the city for every penny spent on the rally. "We have a financial crisis," he said at the time. "The City of Chicago could not afford $2 million on this because we're gonna be laying off people, cutting back. That [cost] would really be unfortunate. . . . It's a huge cost to the City of Chicago.      "This is not a presidential visit. . . . This is a political event, and they've agreed to pay for all those services -- all the expenses of that. ... It's costly, but they raised quite a bit of money. There's no [shortage] of money in that campaign."      The day after the Nov. 4 election, Daley was asked again whether the Obama campaign would pay up.       "Yeah. I don't know why you're so negative. ... What is this? He just won for president, and you say, 'He's not gonna pay his bills,' " the mayor said then.      On Dec. 9, the day the Sun-Times disclosed the $1.74 million tab, Obama spokesman Ben LaBolt referred questions to the DNC.      Paxton confirmed then that the rally was a "DNC-sponsored event" and that the party was discussing the itemized bill with the city.

If you had the opportunity to write the Constitution using the information you know today (not going by what was available 200+ years ago) how would you set up the election process? What requirements would you use? Would you keep the electoral college?      For example: I would have voting open to any citizen 18 years or older. I would not have voter registration be required before the election, but you would be required to prove citizenship on election day. You would not be required to prove your citizenship every time you voted, only the first time; however if you have not voted for four consecutive years you would be required to prove citizenship again. I would eliminate the electoral college and have candidates elected by popular vote only. The electoral college gives too much power to large states such as California and New York (did you know you can win the election by only winning the 17 largest states). I would be willing to come up with some form of compromise to the electoral college but the way it is currently set up is broken.      Also I'm curious what your answers are by demographics so if you don't mind giving some specifics i would appreciate it.    I'm a white male that claims no party (Independent).

I pay taxes and I DONT QUALIFY? WTF  I am so FKG fed-up. I live in SoCalif and so it's really prevalent here. As well as the Vietnamese invasion that has happened here. If we closed the borders and stopped immigration for 10 years, our monetary problems would be solved.

The U.S lost 37,000 KIA'S during the conflict and over 10,000 MIA'S. I some times think that there could be thousands of U.S POW graves throught North Korea that will never get the proper military burial. I feel like Hollywood has not dedicated a good movie to show our respect to these guys. Were is Tom Hanks on this subject. Maybe there should be a Band of Brothers type series on the Korean Conflict. It was more of a war than Vietnam in my opinion.

20090221000605AAyALHg	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	If you were a magistrate, how would you punish this woman for her crime?	A woman pleads guilty for shop lifting from a local jeweller.  It is the 2nd time she has been before magistrates for this type offence.     She is a single mother of 2 children, she is on benefits and is in debt.        Community or custodial sentance?      My friend and I argued about this yesterday as I think it should be custodial and she said community.  She said I didn't know how hard it was to be a single mother.     I think custodial (or at least custodial suspended for 2 years or so + a hefty amount of community service) as it is the 2nd time she commited this type of offence, and although it is hard for single parents the facts are:-   This is not an excuse to rob other members of the community of their livelyhood.    The government pays an amount of money to all single mothers on benefits and most get by on this without breaking the law.   Alot I also think that the woman should be made to take responsibility for her actions and that although the children may become unsettled by having to stay with another family member for 3 months or so, this is the mothers fault and she would have been aware of the consequences of her actions when she did what she did.           what do you think?

20090221005855AA67nBO	Politics & Government;Immigration	Will my mother be allowed back to the US?	Hello. Please, requesting for my question to be answered as honestly and educated as possible. This is, obviously, something very important to me. Let me just give you some background info      My mother was deported to Mexico back in October/2007. She was living here illegally (I believe) from 1994-2007. My mom tried througout all those years to become a legal citizen, but for some reasons that would take a long time to explain here, she never was able to.      My mom came to the US legally and tried to go through the legal process. But in 1993, because of some idiotic "lawyer" she was not allowed her legal stay here once again and received a Voluntary Deportation letter. My mother's lawyer tried to apply for my mother through "political asylum" and my mom, being from Mexico, was never really allowed to qualify for citizenship through this route.       To make long story short, my mom's lawyer made my mother look like an idiot before the judge during her hearing. My mom's lawyer (which we discovered was never a lawyer after all) fled and never appeared with my mother during the court hearing. The judge thought my mom was trying to fool the system and ordered her deportation. This is where my dear mother made the most human choice and decided to stay regardless. We had no family in Mexico.      Pretty much 17 years later she was found and deported. I have applied for all legal forms through the NVC and the USCIS. Currently I am filling out form DS-230 I "Visa Application"      Will my mother be allowed back to the US, considering she was deported. She has NO criminal record, aside from the deportation, not even a parking ticket. She has paid all taxes since she has lived here even illegally.  Oh and one more piece of information that might be helpful. When my mother was deported, she also signed a form that says she is not allowed back into the country for 10 years. (But everybody tells  me that really means nothing)      Anyways, thanks for reading, and really look forward to the response.

I think it's so anti-American to question the government.I hated how Liberals and others who didn't like Bush questioned Bush and the war for the past eight years.They just proved to me that they were traitors.I mean who do they think they are questioning what the consequences will be based on the decisions of the president and the people in Congress? They should've just kept their mouths closed and followed the president and should not have expressed their concerns with the war and the policies of the Bush administration      It's not like the Founding Fathers ever did that.They supported each other no matter what,and they totally went along with what the president did after America was created.Look how it worked for them.

20090221020907AAT96TE	Politics & Government;Politics	Hitler's views on capitalism, what are they?	Some people suggest that Hitler may have been a socialist. Different people tell me different things. Marilyn Manson denounces capitalism in his song "the beautiful people". In his website, flashes of what appears to be Hitler and perhaps Obama are seen? I'm not sure, but teachers have said Hitler was a far right extremist while others may think that he was a socialist. I didn't think socialists advocated wars of extermination, your thoughts.

20090221021907AApRR3Y	Politics & Government;Elections	Reality of a Bobby Jindal run?	Now, I'll explain myself here.      Out of all the possible Republican presidential hopefuls, Jindal is probably the most intelligent and responsible one, judging mostly on how he handled his own hurricane crisis. But he also seems to be the most unlikely as a Republican.      First off, there is his race. There are still many Republicans who still believe that Obama is a Muslim and isn't born in the US, so I'm curious as to the possibility of a heated or passionate primary where something along the lines of that happening in which and those same voters have to decide whether or not to allow someone of Indian descent to run. (These people once turned down McCain because of a rumor of him fathering a black child)      Second, there is his decision to publicly say he won't accept the stimulus money for his state. That might bite him in the end. Either he refuses to take it and money for projects like rebuilding roads, *levees*, and bridges might go away. How will he get money to fix them? Would he end up raising state taxes? Or if he decides to take it will he seem like "just another politician" and turn off conservative voters who would rather pick someone like, say, Ron Paul, or a Libertarian?      There are many comments made by conservative and anti-Obama Answerers that make me wonder if Jindal has any chance at a real run.

This may seem as a rant, or venting, and in a small part it is, but theres a bigger question here and that is what is wrong with people these days? Also, this isnt political, but I really want it here because this has always been the place where the most heated conversations happen. Thank you for answering this! Im really looking forward to some of your thoughts about whats wrong with our society today.       Before you read know that I am very big on customer service and I dont snap or treat people rudely. I am very nice and I dont try to obviously sell you crap.      I work in a Bakery for a high end store. 90% of my customers are soccer moms. I hate it so much Id love to quit but I cant find a job that pays more than $10 an hour. I mean, GET OFF THE CELL PHONE. I cannot under any circumstance, stress thisenough. I am not, I repeat, I am not your dog. You can act like a descent human, or get the hell out. I mean, nearly everytime someone is on their phone in public, its never about anything important. In fact, about a month ago, some friends and I were at lunch at a restraunt that wasnt too expensive, but nice. We're out in the patio and this stupid women is so deep in her conversation about stamps (YES, STAMPS) that she isnt paying attention to her kids running around. WATCH YOUR CHILDREN!!! I am not, nor have I every been, a bebysitter. I make cakes. Really good and elegant expensive cakes for you. Thats it, not a babysitter. We give out free cookies and this kid comes up and says "I dont like oatmeal", my response of course saying that he can buy one then, so he looks at me with the angeryest eyes and grabs nine of them and runs. Meanwhile the mom is looking on and smiling, "Oh hes so cute." Um, are you kidding me? PLEASE SPANK YOUR KIDS!      Its so rare to find someone who is well-mannered, smart and has this strange idea that we should treat each other with common curtasy. Why are there not more people like this? Why are people so rude and self-centered? I mean, with all the parents I see I guess theres no big surprise there but at certain point the blame really shifts from crappy irresponsible parents to you.      What do you think?
20090221022753AAnqQvN	Politics & Government;Politics	Why do you fight so hard for crumbs?	One of the 950 or so billionaires out of the entire world population nets more income in day than you (or 90% of the US) will in your entire life. So, socialism might still be "evil" in the eyes of the general populus, but think about the rest of us---why do we have to fight like dogs when these people have it made? There isn't a good reason for it, so don't try. When you claim that "capitalism" is best, and hard work will make you just as rich as that bloated Wall Street plutocrat, remind yourself of this simple fact: statiscally, your chances of ever being a billionaire are 17 million to 1. Hey, chin-up, that's almost lottery odds!

20090203113910AAvJ4jO	Politics & Government;Immigration	After someone get deported solely for the reason that they came illegaly, how can they come back to the U.S.?	My boyfriend had been in the U.S. for sixteen years and he got stopped by a cop because he had one of those Pine Trees hanging from his rear view mirror and he basically gave the cop his fake green card. He got deported and I'm trying to get him back because most of his family is illegal and he won't be able to see them until he gets back.      I wanted to know what could be done in order for him to return legally.   We have already decided on getting married at some point, but I do not think that makes much a difference now.      What can be done?
