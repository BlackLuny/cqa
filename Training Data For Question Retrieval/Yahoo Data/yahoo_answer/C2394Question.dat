I can do the transcription, but the story is giving me problems. I want it to be humorous, but I'm just not that funny. So if anyone has a humor streak and would help me I would be so grateful! Here is what I have:    The other day I had the displeasure of cleaning out my kids’ closets. Now, in an effort to avoid the tears and tantrums of departing with toys they are never going to play with again, I usually do this while they are at school. And don’t ya know they never miss those items they claim to love so much! Both my husband and I know that this needs to be done on a regular basis, but there are the select few in my family that just don’t understand. Meet my dad, the hoarder. Now, dad isn’t a classic hoarder like you see on Dr. Phil whose house is completely overrun with junk, but he just can never seem to part with his beloved stuff. After all, you never know when that special something you’ve been keeping for the last 30 years will come in handy. When dad couldn’t fit anymore stuff under his trailer, he went out and bought two of those metal storage buildings and is on his way to cramming them full too! Now, I admit there are belongings, such as my wedding dress, that I have crammed in a dark closet somewhere that will probably never see the light of day again and I have trinkets in my curios, but they serve an aesthetic purpose. And while I’m sure that my dad has sentimental belongings, most of his stuff he keeps because he thinks that one day it will be worth a fortune and when he passes, my brother and I will be millionaires. For instance, crammed in his closet are marbles, Lincoln Logs, remote control cars, and various other junk.       I always joke around and say that when dad does pass I'm just gonna cry over the millions I've lost while I toss the match. So, anyone out there that can make this funny?

Honestly, i have my appointment pending because the civil service needs the license number.      does it take several months for me to wait for my license number? or i must have to apply to have it? do i have to fill up a separate sheet to acquire my license number?    i can wait for my ID and a board certificate but i honestly need my license number.    Does the board certificate reflects the license number of a professional?    i hope and pray that someone who had experienced and know more about this may bumped into this questions i am having and give me sincere answers.   thank you so much.

20090130162025AAInFgJ	Education & Reference;Teaching	I am subbing in a high-needs elementary school. How do I deal with unruly behavior?	Yesterday I subbed at an elementary school in a high crime/low socioeconomic neighborhood. My education prof gave me a broad overview of the students in my class (she's also one of the parish's school psychologists) - broken homes, fetal alcohol syndrome, no parental involvement, etc. The kids were amazing individually, but as a whole I could not get control over the class. I used the regular teacher's discipline plan, called the principal for intervention, and their enrichment teacher punished them for their behavior (He saw them out his window.). How do you get these students to pay attention, or am I relegated to babysitting instead of teaching? Thank you!

20090130175740AAlfbGh	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Is it worth it to study artifcial intelligence? It is a branch of computer science. Thanks a lot! : )?	Hi! I have a keen interest in studying about new technologies. I get really excited when i read about recent technology breakthroughs. A recent technological breakthrough has occurred, it's still A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) in its infancy but remember for something as big and life changing as this you'd need to take baby steps to reach to the goal, This creation of the memristor will pave the way for scientists studying the simulated neural networks. Look up what a memristor is if you don't know. Anyway, I'm not here to enlighten you about anything. I'm just wondering if you think it's worth to study AI. I don't think i have the ability to make a lot of money as most of AI has to do with researching and what not. I really don't know. I really want to major in something to do with technology, but I don't know what. I don't want to major in any engineering fields either...i'm pretty clueless. If you know about any booming technology industry please let me know! I'm just curious. Please don't answer if your not going to give me a decent answer. I want some substantial answers. Thanks soo much!

20090130183251AAUwqWi	Education & Reference;Other - Education	Twilight theory read it NOW!!!!!!!!?	So if you have read Midnight Sun(the 1st 12 chapters) and you have watched Twilight, don't you think that Esme has a thing for Edward? I think she is secretly in love with him. Because in Midnight Sun all she ever thinks about through the 1st 12 chapters is Edward,Remember when she says he should do ANYTHING just to stay?? And in the movie Twilight Esme is looking at Edward the WHOLE time!!!! I just wanted to know if anyone else thought that besides me and my besties.      p.s. I mean that she likes him more than a motherly way. I know he is her favorite! But why would he be her favorite unless she has a thing for him?? DUH!!!!!!      I also have this theory:   That Esme wanted to kill Bella so she secretly got with James coven so she could kill Bella.   That's why she stayed behind when everyone else went to save Bella. Esme was afraid her instincts would over come her and she would kill Bella and blow her cover. She planned to kill Bella but it didn't work out, but if it would have, she would have killed Carlisle or Alice next.   Carlisle:   because she wanted to be able to show her affection freely.   Alice:   because she thought Alice was a threat since Edward cared greatly for her(as a sister) Esme knew Alice would get Jasper to get revenge on Esme for killing her brothers love.

So, I'm planning on majoring in Psychology but I can't decide which science I should take (in my senior year of high school).  The choices are AP Physics, AP Biology, or AP Chemistry.  They all count as two college credits (if I pass the AP exam of couse) and I'm just as good in Biology as I am in Chemistry and though I've never taken physics, I know the teacher really well, so I'm more likely to ask for help if I need it.  Also, the Physics class gets to go to Carowinds, Six Flags, and the State Fair.  I just can't decide which would be better to take for my major.

Ice man Story:He is called the Iceman.His frozen body was found in a mountain pass in the alps, on the italian-Austrian border in europe.Two hikers discovered the Iceman by chance in 1991.His body and possession were taken to a laboratory, where scienctists learned more about him.His clothing,tools, and his body were well perserved. they provided clues about the iceman's life and death.Scientist determined that the iceman lived about 5,000 years ago in about 3000b.c.The iceman's finely stiteched animal skins showed that he probably came from a community that included people who were skilled in sewing.the most important clue about the Iceman's life was his copper ax.Copper was the first metal used by europeans, begging about 4000 b.c. the ax left no doubt that the iceman lived after people had learned to use copper.In many ways the story of the iceman helps us to understand the story of our past.      2.

I find it a little too much.      I'm heavily contemplating on which class to drop.      I'm taking American Sign Language 200 and Child Nutrition.      pros about American Sign Language 200: it's a second language. I'll be able to communicate to the deaf (if I ever come across any).      cons: it's really hard. I don't really care for my class that much. There's like 30 - 35 people there. A little too big. I find myself not learning as fast as the others.      pros about child nutrition: I like the class. It seems really easy. The teacher is cool.       cons: I get a vibe from the teacher as: "children should be guided with a book on how to do this or that. children shouldn't watch TV or they'll be...blah blah" type of thang. the class is 6:30 to 9:40. It seems a little irrelevant to me.      Both classes are the same credits. I don't need anymore elective credits at school, so I don't know what to do.      which one do you think?

I love helping people feel good about themselves. San Jose State University has a Marketing program but they don't talk about Fashion at all. The Art Institute has Fashion as a big part of the major.

But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,    All losses are restored and sorrows end.

20090130200801AALZCtq	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Is it me, or do my professors actually seem to like me because I'm Mexican-american?	In my classes at community college, most of my teachers seem to have more respect and good things to say about me me than I see them do with the other students. But I don't know exactly why. I know I'm a really good writer and mostly write about the pyscholigcal and philisophical aspects of things, but I can't see why else they seem to like me. I don't really participate in class, I just show up everyday, do my thing, and leave. My major is Computer Science/Environmental Engineering. In my English class last year I swear my professor , although indirectly, really thought highly of me compared to almost everyone else.      So why do you think I keep getting this feeling that my instructors like me.

Then he said "im not buying it" i felt so bad, i think he thinks i cheated or something and i would never do that!!!!!!!
