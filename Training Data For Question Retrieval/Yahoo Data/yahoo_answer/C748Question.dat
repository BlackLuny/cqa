The Value of a  Drink      'Sometimes when I reflect back on all the wine I drink   I feel shame.  Then I look into the glass and think   about the workers in the vineyards and all of their hopes   and dreams .. If I didn't drink this wine, they might be out   of work and their dreams would be shattered.   Then I say to myself, 'It is better that I drink this wine and let their   dreams come true than be selfish and worry about my liver.'   ~ Jack  Handy      WARNING:  The consumption of alcohol may leave you wondering what the hell   happened to your bra and panties.      ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...

And when the herd is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest ones at the back that are killed first.  This natural selection is good for the herd as a whole, because the general speed and health of the whole group keeps improving by the regular killing of the weakest members.  In much the same way, the human brain can only operate as fast as the slowest brain cells.  Excessive intake of alcohol, as we know, kills brain cells.  But naturally, it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first.  In this way, regular consumption of beer eliminates the weaker brain cells, making the brain a faster and more efficient machine.  That's why you always feel smarter after a few beers.'

20090220185350AAB67hR	Food & Drink;Vegetarian & Vegan	Have you ever been tricked into eating meat/animal products?	I can only remember it happening to me the once. I was at a barbecue at my friend's house and his parents made out they'd bought some veggie sausages just for me. They didn't LOOK like veggie sausages but being the tender age of 14 or so I believed them, thinking that adults would understand the importance. When I was sitting down outside I bit into one, instantly thought 'ARGH THIS IS MEAT', spat it out and went inside to ask them because I thought maybe they'd given me the wrong ones or something. They still maintained the sausages were vegetarian but I didn't argue because it wouldn't have come to any good. On closer inspection I could even see that they looked exactly they same as everybody else's sausages.      Of course if anything like that happened now I would be pretty angry/hurt and they'd know about it. I'd far prefer to just pick at a bit of bread than be tricked into eating meat.      Things like this make me really angry! It's total disrespect :(      Has anything similar happened to you?      Also, meat eaters, what do you think of stuff like this happening?

Well i was going to cook dinner so i unthawed a pound and put it in the fridge, and then i got a phone call and i had to go out of town so my husband told me to put it back in the freezer. I don't know if it is safe to eat now because i heard that you cant freeze and thaw and then refreeze meat. I heard it makes the meat bad. Does anyone know if it is safe to feed my family especially my 2 year old. Thank You very much.

20090220193650AAfI4ye	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	My cookies are ruined because of whipped butter?	I have been wondering why my cookies are turning out crappy, so tonight as I was making two batches of choclate chip cookies and following the directions perfectly I baked my cookies and brought them out and they lookied horrible and fell apart. I finally figured out it was the whipped butter that I have been buying. Now my question is, in the morning I am going to get sticks of butter, since I used a cup of whipped butter for both batches what measurements would I use to equal amounts of butter. Im putting the dough in the fridge tonight and need to finish them up tonight, they are for the inlaws. I don't want to seem like I can't handle choclate chip cookied. Thanks for any pointers you have!

Ok so I am a vegan if you are a meat eater do you dislike vegans or vegetarians because they prefer not to eat meat? Or any other reasons?       What are your thoughts on Peta are you for or against?   I am for and I have talked to people that say Peta are trying to take over are minds. How I don't know can anyone explain? I just think there raising awareness and not forcing people to do anything they don't want to they are willing to compromise( like eating 1 ONE vegetarian meal a week) unlike some meat eaters?       Also fur why do people wear it I know everyone knows that animals are torched for there fur. There is so much faux fur out there that look almost the same as real fur and you can't tell them apart. I don't know why these celebs wear this expensive fur when most designers stop using real fur. I mean a 20,000 jacket doesn't make you an any better person.       Please give me your thoughts.   Thank You

20090220211156AApzPAr	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	Was my duck confit made correctly?	hey.  i went to an upscale restaurant the other night, and one of the items we ordered was a duck and medjool date dish.  it was terrible, the duck was way overcooked, and the sauce was bitter and not acidic.  we sent it back (and i NEVER complain about food...).  anyway, we asked to have the duck confit instead.        when it came out, it looked great. it was crispy-fried and the outside was crackly.  the center was better than the edges and outer portions, but it was fairly dry and i found it difficult to eat without the sauce or some wine.  i told my girlfriend i thought it wasn't good either, and she said she liked it and thought i was wrong.      so my question is: was the confit not good?  i'm not a huge food buff, but i have always been under the impression that a confit should be tender and somewhat 'melty'--that it should be rich, sumptuous, moist, and fall apart in your mouth.  am i wrong?  thanks for reading.

What is the scientific explanation to the following question:      How come when I eat something sweet (lets say a lot of sour gummies) and I eat something else that is sweet (lets say a cookie), it tastes less sweet than it is supposed to?
