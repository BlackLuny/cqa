k2wPknXlaa	Collin: A lot of people feel depressed from time to time. 16 can be difficult. I think it's tough to feel different than others. It's sounds like you need some support.  Your best bet may be to find someone to talk to. You might talk to your Doctor or find a teacher at school that you like to refer you to someone that they trust. This is something you will work through with time
AA10911602	The gullible man died because he was easily fooled, but that doesn't help you.|`|mVTGl6HGaa	The Grauballe Man died from having his throat cut, but he also had a fractured cranium and leg. Why he was killed is not known, but maybe for sacrifice. As with several other bog bodies, it is assumed that either a sacrifice or execution as punishment for a crime was the cause of his injuries. He also had a mysterious cord around his neck as discovered by National Geographic. Recent scans have reconstructed his face and revealed a lot of facts about him, including that he was beginning to develop gout and already had arthritis. Other than that, he appears to have been a healthy male, about 30 years old.
QKnY5Hw9aa	Don't self diagnose.  Those tend to self-fulfilling prophecies!  Social phobia is prople having extreme anxiety about preforming in front of others, but this is when it's extremely debilitating!  Chances are your just a teenager!  That is how 90% of teenagers feel.  If you feel it is really interfering with you life and daily functioning you should mention it to your doctor and they'll give you a refferal to receive a real diagnosis.  If it's just an uncomfortable lack of confidence you have, work on bringing that up and don't worry, it goes away as you get older!|`|v84od8vraa	You need to stop living for others approval and live your life for yourself and your future. Think about the life puzzle you are now putting together for yourself, let it be one you'll look at when you're old and grey and you'll smile and know that you lived it for you positively and happily. And remember, no matter what you do, there's always critics out there so let it be and just be you without worrying of what anyone thinks of you.|`|8RqmZ3zpaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZEH4E6BY..." rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZEH4E6BY...</a><br>  <br>  I found this youtube video quite some time ago when I was battling with my Panic Disorder.

7p1Amhofaa	that sounds like a messed up life in my books...<br>  but do consider the good things that you already have- its so easy to lose sight of them, whilst not realizing that others are going through worse... <br>  now iunno what to say about your mom, to say that "its her life, she can do whatever she wants" wouldn't exactly be right, as you're family, and it seemed like she didn't really discuss this matter to you much, or perhaps she did but you guys didn't come to an agreement... <br>  its neat that you really care about your family situation though...<br>  as for your friends, well, you gotta see whats out there- not all people are jerks, and for sure in the near future, you're probably gonna meet some good friends who're not mean and won't make fun of you...<br>  hope this helps :)
8lcNupM2aa	I lived my life exactly like that. It was a living hell. Then a little later on my wish came true and they got divorced. Too bad for me it was when I was already old enough to think of moving out. <br>  <br>   He's still the same loser, now living in a tiny trailer w/ no job while my sister (her real dad) pays his rent for him.  People like that eventually get theirs, don't worry.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is to live your life, deal with it for the time being until you can get away from it and then do your own thing. Eventually he won't matter anymore and neither will his opinions.<br>  <br>  Take it easy and stay strong.|`|JoitjQRtaa	My girlfriend is going through the same thing and what you need to do is always have a plan to do something with your life.

ys6ZHLceaa	my ex-best friend and my boyfriend got into a verbal argument a few months ago.  it was bad enough where i was kicked out of her wedding party, he wasn't allowed to come to her wedding anymore, and she doesn't talk to me anymore.<br>  <br>  it's a messed up situation though.  and a very long story.<br>  <br>  you win some and you lose some.<br>  <br>  usually when people have a problem with somebody it's because they have a problem with themselves.  good luck.....<br>  <br>  <br>  edit:  a lot of people do create their own problems.  i just let them hang their own noose after so long.  (metaphorically)|`|1fruneZ1aa	Yes, I've had that problem. I was friends with a guy- purely platonic, no<br>  physical attraction AT ALL- but his wife was insecure and very jealous.<br>  All though I went out of my way to be nice to her, the friendship was<br>  pretty much doomed.|`|4u8Uu5woaa	I've been in this situation. Things only get worse, because the your best friend is influenced by what their significant other says. I just left my realtionship with them alone...i got sick of being treated like crap. But i've never had a gf, or a gf who has done that to others.|`|emOhSyY5aa	Yes I have been in this situation a few times. They way I deal with it is by treating my friends significant other as though they are a friend as well. For instance one of my guy friends had a girlfriend and she felt I was having feelings for him. When he told me that (while she was not around of course) I waited until I had seen her again and engaged in conversation with her. I started talking about a guy that I like around her and asked her what she thought about him. That let her know immediately that I had no feelings for my friend whatsoever and now we get along fine.|`|K45xwCxoaa	oh boy..tell me about it:(<br>  <br>  its so BAD..<br>  I had an argument with my best friend about that person, and I showed that other person that "I DONT LIKE YOU EITHER" i couldnt do anythign else.. and i tried to hang out with my best friend as much as i could so that if the other person really didnt like me, he/she wouldnt hang out with my friend:D and it worked:D|`|8Bs7OFfOaa	It is kind of hard.<br>  My best friend's fiancee hates me,<br>  but it's not what they want.<br>  it's what your friend wants.<br>  Talk to your friend about this because it's<br>  your friends choice who they're friends<br>  with. Not the signifigant other's.<br>  If he/she has a problem with you, it's probably jealousy.<br>  :)|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Yeah it can do. <br>  <br>  What I would do is try to see my friend separately - without the SO, in order to still enjoy the friendship. However if the friendship wasn't as fulfilling or the SO always tagged along, I guess I would be less enthusiastic about the friendship and try to see them less. I would still be there for them though in the event of the break-up especially if it turned out that the SO was nasty. Or if it became clear the SO was here to stay I would try and get on with them as best I could, in the limited times I would see them.<br>  <br>  If the SO had made any negative comments about me, I would take it up with the friend to see what effect that would have. Just let them know how I felt. While I wouldn't expect them to give up the relationship for me, I feel it would be important to let them know my feelings and how this would change my behaviour. Also so they could talk to the SO about it.<br>  <br>  If any friends didn't like my SO I would like them to tell me - I do what is mentioned above though and have plenty of time with friends with SO not present - in case any of them don't like him (though there's no evidence of that). Yeah it's difficult. Sometimes friends can even get jealous that the other person has a SO at all which can also lead to friendship problems.<br>  <br>  In general I would put a long-term friend ahead of a SO because they probably have my best interests at heart more and are more likely to be my friend in the future instead of an ex. Whereas if I thought there was jealousy or spite involved on the part of the friend I would ignore them.<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|Y7YC2FzZaa	ok this is going to sound like BS but I don't have that problem. I get along very well with people and have kept my core friends as close as ever even though several really don't like my wife.
K45xwCxoaa	Great i can use this for my research paper. THANK YOU, you are the best!!!|`|YwE5kIB8aa	I think it's really cute.|`|YSRXarooaa	wait it means that they think women should be in charge? Whats wrong with that? They just don't want men to take over them and everything. I would think another girl like you would understand but I guess you like to be a pushover to men and have no respect.
Y7YC2FzZaa	when you have a task master who enjoys using the whip its hard to convince them that the whip is wrong. You have far too many people either supporting femanazis or afraid of them. you keep up the good fight though and I assure you my sons wont grow up embracing their cult either.|`|CjxwKrHzaa	Real oppression is something you know nothing of.  Be more concerned for recession, no jobs, no business, poverty, homeless, sick, etc, etc.  All people in the western world have rights.  The laws are made by politicians and legal people - not feminists.  Visit my castration clinic immediately.|`|nLd4mF4Jaa	As far as I can see women are by far the most effective opponents of the hatefulness of feminism. They can see how laughable and out of tune it really is.|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	So, we should protect men from a woman's right to vote? The right to work? Odd.|`|tUzCFeMJaa	While I wouldn't consider myself a feminist I wouldn't consider feminism as something men need to be "protected" from by women. <br>  <br>  While some things I see to be ridiculous, I can see the good changes feminism has influenced.<br>  <br>  Men will turn out to be men whether you women like it or not. There's nothing women can say or do that will change that, women can only change themselves.|`|bTMdpMW9aa	Sweetie, have you ever bothered to do your homework on feminism because you obviously haven't. If it wasn't for feminism you wouldn't have the rights you have now.<br>  <br>  Think of how it was in the '50's, '40's and downwards from there. You would be probably nothing more than a housewife. You would have been a whore if you even bothered having sex before marriage. You wouldn't be able to wear a shirt that you are wearing in your pic without hearing horrible comments towards you. And you would have an extreme less likely chance of going to college or having a career because that wasn't expected for you. And let's not get to the point that there was a time that marital rape was legal so you couldn't get justice if your husband raped you.<br>  <br>  Honestly the whole comparing feminism to slavery is stupid. Feminists don't want to exterminate men, hold them as slaves, or control them. Real feminists just want equal rights as men and be respected as women and just like civil rights and gay rights activists, they want sexism to be at an end (even though it never will just like homophobia and racism will never end).<br>  <br>  So I'm a feminist so do you think my boyfriend is being stupid by dating me because of my views that you have seem to screw up tremendously?|`|fwdnXIOoaa	My mother told me that I should be cooking, cleaning and taking care of my husband even though I am the bread winner, work a full week, study at university and still get my son to school on time.  <br>  <br>  Women's Liberation is not about women oppressing the rights of men for their own advantage but women fighting for the same rights as men already have such as equal pay, paid parental leave and the right to dress as they choose without getting sexually harassed in the work place.  <br>  <br>  The predecessors of the Women's Rights movement should be praised for the advances they have made.  I certainly enjoy the benefits of being a liberated women and by no means do I fear that I am somehow oppressing my male counterparts by having equal opportunities in the world.|`|vEj7xoBraa	you are 100% right.|`|f6f40965eb7d5df6aa94440ec71e32dcaa	First of all, you need to distinguish between feminism and Radical Feminism.  Radical feminists are the stereotypical feminists: Man-hating harpies that only want rights when it's convenient for them.  Please don't lump all feminists together.  <br>  <br>  And what are we women going to do to protect our women and daughters from anti-feminism?
Y7YC2FzZaa	most of the ism's out their hurt us more than help. Feminism is taking on the form of a cult and all cults are bad.|`|I5pUxwPbaa	I don't agree with feminism myself, it's just another form of attempted oppression against a group (men in this case). feminists spend their time glorifying women while belittling men, and for some reason want to fight so they can be 'free' to work all day then come home and do all that work too basically doing everything, causing stress for themselves and the rest of the family. why a woman wants to 'be it all' or 'be a man' is beyond my understanding.|`|YSRXarooaa	what is your problem? why do you hate feminism so much? it has nothing to do with slavery. Its women wanting respect because of a lot of idiot men who don't care about women and don't treat them like people. So why is it bad that women want that to stop? p.s. why don't you look at your other question thats exactly the same instead of asking it twice.
YSRXarooaa	Yes. I think everything on mtv and vh1 is for pathetic losers whit no life who like to see ugly whores be retarded to entertain themselves. Its so stupid.|`|Cx327Rotaa	I think it is trashy and full of fake hair!  :/|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	No, I think it's an eye sore to have to watch the deflated bag of elephant skin with eyeliner.|`|XKk101Kqaa	No, I think it's lame.<br>  <br>  Those women are WILLINGLY on that show trying to get that douchbag who looks like a chick.|`|Y7YC2FzZaa	no its not, it shows how very shallow people can be male and female.|`|emOhSyY5aa	Yes. Just as Flavor of Love was and is.
m5eHZvPfaa	Yes women do watch pornography, women get off on it, and women like it. Some women do not watch it, and some woman do.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Yeah some do I don't know the statistics though<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|1888bff8ef07d4859fd7c43b635cd7f4aa	sure<br>  as long as it only involves mutually-consenting adults <br>  why not?|`|STumBiU0aa	I cant speak for the larger population of women but i can tell you about my experiences with it.  Most women i know do not look at porn but some do.  Porn is generally aimed at men -this is probably why.  My boyfriend wanted me to watch porn once so i did to humor him.  It really didnt do anything for my arousal wise and i thought it was kinda cheezy and boring.  Also it objectifies women (as well as the men!).  But hey, if you like porn then go for it.|`|Y7YC2FzZaa	yes and quite often. Women own the pornography industry and women do represent a major part of the consumer base. I know plenty of women who read porn and watch it. As time goes by and the stigma is lessened you will see them more willing to admit it.|`|WKtakdsOaa	Yeah all the time and they do from when they are really young just like boys. Its totally normal and I dont know how you dont know this didnt you ever talk at school?|`|YSRXarooaa	not me. But yes a lot of women do. But men do it more.|`|NnG5GBGAaa	Some do, some don't.<br>  Some truly enjoy it, <br>  Some view out of curiosity more than pleasure.<br>  Some watch it to please their man.<br>  Also, keep in mind, that "all pornography is not created equal".<br>  One flick may arouse, another may bore, and another may be a turn off, depending on peoples individual preference and taste.<br>  There are so many genres to chose from.<br>  Personally...I like extremely hard core...BDSM with a hint of vanilla sex, and a side order of girl on girl and/or fetish flick.<br>  The run of the mill stuff doesnt cut it for me.|`|1vaqtRI2aa	Yes, of course.<br>  <br>  Often, couples look at it together and lots of women look at it alone, whether women want to admit it or not.<br>  <br>  Interesting question, starred it.|`|kxcDDMw9aa	A third of all pornography is consumed by females. So yes, women definitely look at pornography.|`|aae04e3689e2835b454c72ee27fc318aaa	I do; as long as it's good quality.

AA11879371	Well, it took your whole life to get where you are now, so it may take a while to get out of that emotional rut.<br>  <br>  Yes, you absolutely need validation of who you are and what you feel.  Because of your emotional background that will take a bit of work on your part.  You've already come a long way in realizing your dilemma.<br>  <br>  You won't get over needing approval of others anytime soon.  Try to approve of yourself and the things you do.  Work at getting a friend who understands where you are coming from.  Again that may take a while.  <br>  <br>  Good luck, hun.|`|Vmp1KK1iaa	Wanting the approval of others isn't bad, everyone wants the approval of someone,but needing is a whole other thing. I believe that everyone has to have at least one person they want the approval of as long as that person is a positive friend or role model. If you want to stop needing the approval of everyone you need to find that one person who is good enough for your wanting of approval. It seems hard but it is really easy. I had that sort of problem, but I found a teacher who was dedicated to children and I knew I wanted to be as nice, cool,and smart as her. In the end I worked my butt off in school and I always had her approval. Just find the one person you most want to impress and try your best. Just so you know you probably already have others approval so you don't have to worry.
WpGROxH8aa	I had a huge crush on a black guy I used to work with. I thought maybe he liked me at first but then I figured that he just like me as a friend. Oh, well. He was really hot and and nice. He hugged me a couple times as a friend and I just melted. OMG. <br>  But I don't work there anymore so I don't see him anymore. I tried facebook messaging him but he just messaged me back, short and polite, but not interested. Oh, well. <br>  But, no, white girls don't all only like white guys.<br>  Good luck :)|`|5GPDrBPLaa	Maybe instead of the color of the girl you're going for, try looking for something different, like a different personality.  It might be the type of chic you're looking for that always ends up in crap.  Sorry man, hope you find a keeper. :)
pTmUycXzaa	I think if you do what you love you are rich in ways money can't buy.

6qPTQDdZaa	The only way you're going to elminate discrimination against anyone, whether blacks, whites, men, women, etc., is for people's attitudes to change.  You can make all the laws in the world but they won't change people's hearts.  In fact, you could argue that affirmative action helps keep discrimination going in a way.  Some people see this as discrimination itself (and let's face it, it is for the most part-affirmative action is the politically correct way to say you're a racist, sexist, or sticking it to "the man") and will think minorities are getting benefits they don't deserve, whether that's really happening or not, and will then discriminate against them to level the playing field.  You really can't have true equality as long as there's preferences given to certain races and/or sexes.<br>  <br>  So if you want to end discrimination, you have to change people's thought processes.  How do you do that?  Well, that's the tricky part.  There isn't an easy way to do this.  Some of it comes over time as people from different backgrounds work and live together and see they're not so bad after all.  Education is a key here.  <br>  <br>  Also, it's not politically correct to say this, but some women and minorities need to get the chip off their shoulders and quit being racist or sexist themselves.  The whole world is not out to get you.  Of course, it stands to reason those who really are racist or sexist against these people need to stop that as well, but I figured that was something everyone would think of.  People don't often want to talk about the reverse happening, despite the fact that it's very real.  <br>  <br>  I don't think discrimination will ever truly be eliminated.  Somebody will always find something about others they don't like.  But that doesn't mean we should stop from trying.<br>  <br>  CAustin is right though.  This is a very broad question, a little too broad to really get a good answer, unless you're planning to write a book.<br>  <br>  I think it might be good to point out how men are discriminated against as well.  If you don't think it happens, I have two words for you:  paternity leave.  Good luck finding it compared to maternity leave.|`|fDGPbwdsaa	Realise that if feminism wants to be taken seriously by society - it needs to stop pretending that *only* women are discriminated against, and it needs to stop demanding preferential treatment for women while simultaneously insisiting women & men are equal.|`|Y7YC2FzZaa	I think the solution was met and your a bit late.

8QdtFVe2aa	According to macroeconomic theory, government spending "crowds out" (decreases) investment. This is because if governments spend more, then they must save less - the decreased saving drives up real interest rates, which causes investors to be less likely to take out loans. The increased government spending may also cause inflation, because there is increased "aggregate demand" in the economy. The House Republicans might be concerned that government spending will decrease investment.<br>  <br>  Another approach to this is to look at SOME classical real business cycle models. Here we assume that wages and prices adjust immediately, and that there is perfect information in the economy. Then, government spending crowds out investment, causes the investment-saving curve to shift right, and increases aggregate demand. However, this just means that demand has increased - it has done nothing to real output. Real output only increases in the short-run if something positive happens in the labour market. Of course, this approach is not supported by empirical findings; most classical economists will suggest that stuff actually does happen in the labour market to increase real output.<br>  <br>  Thus, if you support this classical approach, then you will believe that government spending does not raise real output; indeed, it will only decrease investment and cause inflation.|`|EogAAkV4aa	If government injections decrease in an economy, the balancing forces are the real demand for money which will decrease, the interest rate, which will have to increase, which will mean people want to save money again, more bonds will be traded etc.<br>  <br>  It seems like they're trying to nurture the shocked bond market and hedge funds affected by the sub-prime crisis by making their capital more valuable, and also, if the government doesn't spend money, it can't possibly go further into national debt - which is a bad thing.<br>  <br>  The economic theory being utilized is the Macroeconoic theory, a keyensian approach to be specific.|`|rekYyOiiaa	Common sense theory.<br>  <br>  If you were lean on cash, would you go spend your money on a bunch of "nice to haves"?

No matter what the issue may be.  Later
s3YuchHoaa	There are so many more important things in life than these people . They may remember this some time in their lives and feel horrible about it . They are having a lot of hard things going on in their lives and feel like because they are hurt they need to hurt someone else. That doesn't mean you deserve pain though.Do not curse back at them because that just means you are responding to their negativity. Go talk to your school counselor about it and your principal. If you stop giving these boys a reaction like cursing,yelling,running, or being afraid of them they will most likely stop because you are not paying them attention. Their parents may beat them or not pay them any attention and they feel that they need so much attention so they are looking for anyone and anyway to get some attention and the only way they know how to do it is by being violent because violence is probably teh only thing they know. I would feel sad for them and just ignore them until they left me alone. But do not be afraid of them because they want to feel powerful because they have no control over their lives in their home. They cannot hurt you and you cannot allow them to . See the thing about people is people can only hurt you if you allow them to . Do not hurt yourself because you do not deserve pain. You will grow from this experience so much in your life. When I was in school I didn't understand why bullies were so mean either I used to beat up bullies for beating up on other kids. I was the bully of the bullies. I knew what they were doing was wrong but I didn't know that they were doing it because they were hurt , it took me years to learn that.|`|XlGjBPBTaa	Well; real eyes; when I was in seventh grade and the bullies started in on me I found out that if I make friends with someone MUCH bigger than me they quit bothering me.  I started hanging out where the football team ate lunch and soon I had real big people to walk with and the bullies kept their distance unless they caught me alone.<br>  Since I was honest with the football players as to why I was hanging with them(for protection) they showed me some moves which are designed to thwart bullies.<br>  You can learn these from anyone that studies karate or ju jitsu and evel little people can overcome big people.|`|bbc94e509cc1cde8fbb2273c1fbd2897aa	Teachers never help when you're being bullied, they just make it worse. Don't ignore them either. That's the worst advice ever. I don't really know how to deal with it though.. standing up to them is as good as any advice I guess. Bullies are usually pretty thick, so just comment on their inferior intellect etc etc. Best is to just stay calm, and if they insult you, answer calmly and coolly with some clever or witty remark. Bullies can't counteract that because they're idiots. Don't let them see that it's getting to you at all. Hope this helps, I'm not really the best at this sort of advice.|`|khbSXMcIaa	your right, talking with the teachers doesn't help.<br>  <br>  i think you should just ignore them... their dumb boys and they are only doing this because they want a reaction out of you. if you show them that they aren't doing anything to you, they'll move on.<br>  <br>  i believe you when you say your not emo. i think your doing that to release the pain that you feel. but if you keep doing that, people will begin to call you emo and then more people will tease and make fun of you.<br>  <br>  keep your head up, show confidence, and pretend what they don't exist.<br>  <br>  i hope things get better.|`|WWnkLkqqaa	Talk to an adult that you feel comfortable with ie parent, teacher Doctor or even the police.

Also please keep in mind, and I know this from bad high school experiences that what you are in middle/high school is VERY temporary. It has nothing to do with who you are later in life.

When you feel a tantrum coming on, do something physical.  Jump rope, hit a punching bag, run, swim, bike.  Physical outlets are a lot healthier than going into hysterics for you as well as your family.  Emotions can be controlled through other outlets.  It is a matter of redirecting your energy.<br>  <br>  The trick for you is to find the one that you enjoy.|`|L5tWiYOFaa	You're a woman, it's your job.

But if you stop and think about it, we actually do it to ourselves.  You will always have to deal with stress and anxiety in life.  You have to change the way you think about them.<br>  <br>  When a stressful situation comes up, you make a mental decision, whether you realize it or not, that I am going to get upset or not get upset.  You choose to react to the stressful events with a temper tantrum.  <br>  <br>  It took me years to figure that out. I am a very empathic and emotional person.  One day driving down the road it dawned on me that I can control my emotional response to things in life by the way I think about them.  <br>  <br>  Your thoughts direct and guide your emotions.  Emotions are like squishy blobs of jello that are hard to get a hold of directly because they jiggle and squirm away.  People try to grab and control the emotions. Because they wiggle and giggle away people give up trying to control them.  You control them by your thoughts.  <br>  <br>  You THINK to yourself, I am not going to get upset about these foolish things. These things are not worth my energy and time that I can be investing somewhere else on something positive that I enjoy doing.  Or you can ask yourself the 5-Why's.  Why am I upset?  Then why this?  Then why that? Do this five times (sometimes it takes more than 5) to get to the bottom or root of what is making you upset.  <br>  <br>  But again, your emotions only travel where your mind and thoughts allow them to go.  So change your thinking. Think about your reaction before you tell your mind to let the feelings go forward like a giggly, wiggly tornado.  Think before you emote.|`|nQOaKiueaa	You should not think about it a lot.<br>  That's why you worry a lot because you think about what you think is an issue where in fact it's nothing.<br>  It's normal and everybody has the same feeling once in a while.<br>  There's absolutely nothing wrong with you.<br>  Just don't think about it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps... :)|`|ps31sr1laa	well a big part of it is your age, you are still maturing so your hormones are doing crazy things maturing is a tough time for everyone and if you mix that in with fear of the future, stress from school, home ect. ect. it can get kinda messy.

I think this is the period that will define your nature. Cool down and Think hard of what a "stronger person" (that you said) would do in your situation of life. And tend do be like what came in your mind. <br>  <br>  I mean 1st create a ideal person in your thought who is in the same situations of life like you are. Let this ideal person have a good character, nature and all the attributes like smartness, cool and calm  as a cucumber, nice, humble, obedient, responsible, friendly, joker etc. etc. <br>  <br>  Now imagine what he/she would do in all the cases that makes you stressed. And try to follow him. You will find the more you do like him in all those situations, the more content is your heart with a feeling that you are right no matter what others thinks of you. Finally after around a month you will not be tensed by peoples words or thoughts.<br>  <br>  It will be all natural actions, you yourself are similar to that person now. No need to create that person in mind. Instantly, you can decide things and act like him/her.<br>   <br>  You will become more happier than before. And you will thank me someday. Remember you have the answers within you, dont ask me what he/she would do.|`|AA10349833	I would say you need to go talk to a counselor about this one.  I had some crazy tantrums when I was younger where I would rip my bed apart, throw and break things, and just go nuts.  I was very frustrated and had no outlets for it.  I wasn't doing it because I was spoiled...not at all.  I had to do most of the cleaning, cooking and outside chores...before my homework was done.  Nobody cared about my homework, just the housework.  So yea, I would get very angry from time to time and I hated the way it made me feel, so out of control of my life.  This behavior stopped when I moved out of that house and was responsible for myself.  Hormones are probably raging right now, your life is changing rapidly because you are almost an adult and possibly on your own soon so you might be frustrated about that.  I would definitely talk to your doctor about this because they can help you.  I don't know the details of your emotions but as you mature you can learn to control them.  You said after what you have been through at the end.  If you were involved in something physically abusive you need to get some help by a counselor so you don't carry that anger with you for the rest of your life. Please don't listen to these bad reviews of people telling you to visit the doc.  they don't know what they are talking about.

Because of your outlook on things and not boy thirsty, you will find a smart man who will cherish you someday because you are, to me, close to perfect.|`|NlWi9HHkaa	i don't understand why you don't understand your personality.  do you have a problem with your personality?|`|kCSVLi0Haa	This is actually a very funny question. <br>  You just explained your whole personality yourself!<br>  You know yourself better then you think!|`|eD687uffaa	you seem like a nice young lady|`|B9NFOoKSaa	First, I'm not a doctor nor do I play one on TV.<br>  <br>  I know nothing of your age, but it seems to me that you are discovering/have discovered that you have opinions & principles. There are worlds of questions over the topics you've raised, & whatever others may think about them, you are entitled to your opinions of them.<br>  <br>  I don't know the source of your concern, whether it is religious, political or social. I don't believe that there is anything inherently wrong with you but perhaps you would be interested in joining a group of like-minded people to discuss your thoughts with others.<br>  <br>  My pattern has been to listen to everyone you can, but make no snap decisions & there are rarely things that can't be improved upon with some careful consideration. Minds are like parachutes; they only function when they are open.<br>  <br>  Explore yourself & consider the quote "For nothing is either good or evil but thinking makes it so."|`|WlywfjG1aa	I went through your email carefully. I think you are absolutely normal , a emotional and sensitive personality. You may be having some degree of identity crisis. What you need to do is get more assertive , more focused on good values in life , form firm opinions about good and bad. Read some good books on self help. Develop your own philosophy for life. Think of directions you would take in your life. Then you would realize that you are so confident, so definite about what to do and be happy !
XlGjBPBTaa	Attitude is determined by how you look at the world and if you are only looking at yourself then your attitude has nothing to do with the rest of the world.<br>  If they cannot see anything but themselves then they are not aware they are messing up your day.|`|OncdpDunaa	Selfish pride gets in the way of everything.|`|NlWi9HHkaa	self-denial.
WZVz5jWHaa	You're being way too hard on yourself.  If she didn't want you to do it, she would have said something to you right then and there. You're obsessing over nothing.|`|cd8ff0f053ce1a2e1b3303ea5ec2f1c7aa	The fact that you care so much shows that you have a big heart. You seem like a kind person who did something when you weren't thinking straight. It happens. It has been a whole year, so you should be over this by now. Its not like you raped her. You need to think rationally about this. If she didn't want you to kiss her, she wouldn't have kissed you back. It was just a kiss, thats all ok? Stop being so hard on yourself. You don't deserve that. You have to let it go and move on. Do you think she is still thinking about that night and is obsessing the way you are about it? No way! She probably has a bf or something by now. She has moved on and so should you. You didn't do anything wrong.|`|3Wxx2FPkaa	Shortened your question. No one has the time to read stories.|`|0cfwrcx5aa	you're obsessing on something that happened a year ago while you were drunk, weird.  especially considering that it was in a public place, and it wasnt anything illegal.<br>  <br>  if drinking messes your head up this much, maybe you'd better lay off the bottle.  <br>  <br>  havent you had any other experiences with women since then?|`|eD687uffaa	no you didn't sexually assault her she would have told you to stop pushed you away ... you are tripping, she probably wanted you to bone her stop tripping ... dont be depressed you didint violate that women...you might need some mental help i think you maybe diffusional or need someone to define rape... you didint force or threaten her or coherce her she was of age ... i used to think weird **** like that too man ... yeah everything is cool|`|s3YuchHoaa	I think it is awesome that you care so much about this persons wellfare but you also wshould care about your own welfare. Since you have your motives in the right place ,maybe from now on when you like a girl you should ask her if you can kiss her first until you feel comfortable with not violating peoples wishes. Or until you are better able to read a womans body language and instinctivly know when it would be okay to kiss her. The guy not responding in any way isn't your fault. You shouldn't feel depressed about any mistakes you make or best yourself up but instead recognize them and say what can I do better as a person. You seem liek a good person who is very anylitical and I admire that . Do not allow yourself to get upset so much over these things because it is hurting your wellbeing.|`|NlWi9HHkaa	if she was violated, you should have heard about it.  but she must have liked it as she talked about it with her girlfriends!  if she didn't like it, it would have been a shame for her to talk about it - it would have meant she was spoofed.  hahaha!!  ahh when you get to your 40's, you'd laugh at this.
L6U1joGAaa	Unfortunately it is human nature to be intrigued by bad things happening to others. In most cases it doesn't actually mean you are a horrible person and I guarantee your not alone, however being curious should only go so far, and it should only be curiosity. If you start to wish bad things would happen to people then you need to see a therapist. If you believe that in a real life situation you would stand there and watch someone suffer for your amusement instead of try to help, and you feel no remorse for those people then you really need to see a doctor before your psychopathic self emerges.|`|6eed3c6ed1117fe6baa4febd3849d742aa	It means you have no sympathy, either naturally, in which case you are a sociopath, God help you; or you have become desensitized to reality and your conscience, in which case you need to clean up your soul and brain pronto.|`|096b7gBHaa	yes you're a sadist<br>  <br>  that psychological attitude will backfire you through giving multiple pains when you're the one who got tortured, whipped, caned. stabbed, beat up|`|vY5HUrQPaa	It means your heart and mind need renewal. People who have genuine love and compassion in the heart, want to help others. <br>  <br>  This kind of love comes from God, who is Love. He sent His Son to earth to suffer and die for us, so we who accept Him, can love others through Him. <br>  <br>  This isn't about religion, but a relatinship.<br>  <br>  Get to know Him by asking Jesus Christ to come into your heart, to forgive you of any sin. Thank Him for dying for you so you can have eternal life. Confess that you believe He's the Son of God who has risen from the dead. Tell Him that you'll live for Him.<br>  <br>  If you sincerely mean business with God, you're a part of His family As long as you obey Him, He will live in you and change you from the inside out to become like Him in character. Keep the relationship going by: <br>  o Talking to God everyday about everything. Ask for His help in the name of Jesus Christ<br>  o Reading, meditating, and applying His Word daily from the Bible to your life. Start with St. John from an easy-to-read version.<br>  o Making friends at a local Bible-teaching, Holy Spirit-led church, for encouragement.<br>  o Telling others about Jesus Christ.|`|QRbCnBgFaa	i instantly hate you to the extreme.

NlWi9HHkaa	lack of attention, lack of self-confidence.|`|L6U1joGAaa	Maybe you should go to a therapist and have him/her hypnotize you and take you back to age 6 when you first realized this. Something may have happened to you that you have erased from your memory that triggered these feelings in you. Maybe you were hurt repeatedly as a child and it became almost a second nature to you.|`|48SlX2Yiaa	Either you're a sadist or you can't take stress so you get relieved when that mental pain turns to physical|`|FhrCLLzFaa	lol|`|yyldv2olaa	you're just not a whimp.|`|WZVz5jWHaa	That is a question that only a therapist can answer.|`|648ea51d75b359e14d9b6d08b816f6c0aa	The easy answer : YOU ARE INSANE.
AA10349833	Maybe if you were tied up somebody would have to save you.  Did you feel like you needed to be saved?  I think so if you were shy and had imaginary...not so imaginary...friends.  You were lonely.  If these childhood thoughts bother you, go talk to a counselor about it.  Do you ever drive down the road, maybe passing an 18 wheeler and wonder what it would be like if you crashed head on into it?  Well, we all have wild thoughts like that but if we acted on them it would be a problem.  I have scenarios in my head, like I am preparing for mind for something if it happened?|`|7c47435ed764615f7c9efed94837c93faa	I don't know what caused that pleasure reaction for those types of images.

Like your parents porn or something?<br>  Hmm, I guess I didn't realize it started that young and then just went away as it seems to have done with you.
m16gf9mzaa	The most amazing, unbelievable fact that I can think of right now, is that Bob Dylan can actually sing, he just chooses not to.
m5eHZvPfaa	He tried restraining them at first, no one else on the train did anything (but how could they, who'd be crazy to with two CRAZY, DRUNK, PATHETIC females)...he had a right to hit them. I'm a woman, and I'm glad he did. <br>  <br>  Men don't have to take that kind of abuse. The rule for men to not hit women means for men to not hit them out of dominance and disrespect. It doesn't mean they can't defend themselves when being brutally, persistently attacked by a pair of drunk, out of control, frank disrespectful inconsiderate idiot females.<br>  <br>  I want to add that these may have been drag queens at the sound of it.|`|sYNyNFOWaa	Everyone has a right too defend themselves be it against the same-sex, opposite sex, young or old. No matter the person attacking you there is still the possibility of them causing serious harm if their attack goes too far.<br>  But as the police told me when I took a restraining order out on my ex. You can only defend yourself with enough force deemed necessary for the occasion. <br>  But defiantly good on him|`|F8UVorfPaa	They don't sound like ladies, they certainly wern't behaving like ladies so I can't see a problem, though I think the guy might of dealt with his situation  differently.|`|fwdnXIOoaa	I think good on him.  Drunk and disorderly people are sometimes impossible to control because they just can't see sense.  Sounds like he was defending himself, I would have done the same thing even if I was a man.|`|emOhSyY5aa	He did what was right. He defended himself.|`|vlOtkGu3aa	Just remember this saying...<br>  <br>  "I will never hit a woman, but I WILL punch a B****!"|`|DtILThwAaa	They should be forced to bear him young.|`|C7yjMBuqaa	Yes, he did the right thing.  Those two sk*nks deserved to have the sh*t knock out of them.|`|K45xwCxoaa	NO, he did the right thing.|`|lFzFtiCBaa	F those B's in their F-ing A's<br>  <br>  They deserved it.|`|dzHpAIpSaa	That was a strong guy. They had it coming. = \|`|XwqePXrOaa	They were slapping him, and he threw a punch that was so powerful that it knocked both of them to the ground in a single blow.<br>  <br>  Two things wrong with that:<br>  <br>  A) He's not defending himself, he's escalating the situation.  Slapping is irritating, but it's hardly threatening.  Making someone bleed; now that's threatening.<br>  <br>  B) One of the major differences between "The Matrix" and real life is that in the latter, people who aren't Olympic bodybuilders don't knock two people bigger than themselves off their feet in a single blow - partially because of Newtonian physics (he would be flying pretty far in the opposite direction), and partially because of limits to human strength.  If you want to give us a hypothetical situation, it's perfectly acceptable to admit it's hypothetical.<br>  <br>  <br>  Now, as for the basic question that you may be getting at (i.e. "is it okay for men to hit women in self defense?"), the answer is yes.  But I would say the guy in this hypothetical situation acted like a moron (and also a bit like a comic book character), and it has little to do with the genders of any involved.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	And if a 14 year old started slapping him, he'd knock them to the ground, too.<br>  Or a 90 year old with her handbag..|`|CEChcfKwaa	I think your story sounds made up but if it did happen he had no choice. Of course most sensible people wouldn't have told 2 bigger and belligerant drunks to shut up in the first place. That's where you should use your cell phone and dial the police instead of trying to act like a cop yourself. That's why it sounds made up.|`|zIqfIIlMaa	Well deserved.|`|NYU37jfGaa	I don't see what else he could have done, seeing they were attacking him.|`|BdQbVLk0aa	I think he did the right thing... yes, I support the man for hitting those women (in this case)|`|HPqCRBq8aa	If a police would have came around after the fact he would have went to jail. It isn't worth the risk in my book. I wouldn't have done that. Most of these people responding never been to jail. I have.|`|Y7YC2FzZaa	yeah they needed to be hit, its not PC I know but they really needed to get knocked around a bit just so they can feel the pain after they sober up and are able to reason again.|`|CjxwKrHzaa	There's no excuse to hit women.  It wasn't even self-defense.  He should have spoken to train security.|`|fDGPbwdsaa	I agree with the majority - well deserved<br>  <br>  <br>  Blue B said: "There's no excuse to hit women." really... sounds like a bit of sexism there.|`|nvH62xo5aa	if anyone gets drunk and slaps you, you have a right to use self defense. which is what he did. good for him.|`|84gK4XlHaa	5'10" and 6'?  If this did happen, I think chances are good that he didn't hit two women.  He hit two drag queens.|`|YSRXarooaa	they deserved it in this case.|`|6qPTQDdZaa	Well, I have douts this really happened, but if it did...<br>  <br>  I would say he was okay.  Putting your hands on another person and screaming and threatening them is a pretty aggressive act.  Then they started slapping him.  Yes, I'd call this self-defense.  You can't use the "men are bigger than women" argument here either.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, the law probably won't see it that way.  Sexism is still very much alive in this case.  The fact he was outnumbered and the women were bigger and were aggressive first might get him off, but it's still an iffy situation.  It's a shame, because I doubt you could find 20 people in America who'd fault a woman for doing the same thing to 2 men in the same situation even if she had a clear escape path.<br>  <br>  Let's face it, if you reversed the genders there wouldn't be a single person (other than some trolls) who would say a woman was wrong in this situation.
1487d1674981b6aea0adec310c43a272aa	I don't think it is considered empowering for women.  I think we still believe as a society that it is considered immoral for a woman to be loose with her panties.  <br>  Lots of our morals have left our society and not a lot of things shock our society.  Well i should clarify the USA society.|`|HPD4pkUqaa	I don't like it. this kind of women doesn't have moral or charater, they are loose character. Love to someone in real and true sense, you will not anything in flirt. Sex is also a part of love and really very important in life but flirting is really very bed.<br>  Love is the real worship of god.|`|vlOtkGu3aa	I think theyre morally loose.  Throwing yourself at men doesnt make you powerful.  It means your weak and need to work on your self control.|`|QjutnjBHaa	actually it could decide u and u only , no other person . bcz it depens upon  ur thinking  whether u r just flirting or be in love. just remember  other person can do so too.|`|F9Ll7oLJaa	beware of such women|`|L3ebaF2kaa	in my own opinion, they are morally loose..<br>  it doesn't show empowerment for a woman to take a guy home to satisfy their sexual appetite....<br>  it really shows immorality..
PJAU0lFBaa	Blend into the background?  The only man I can think of who would grow a beard to blend into the background might be a fugitive or a covert operative who's trying to disguise his appearance.  I've never heard of any man growing a beard to avoid women.  In fact most men believe a beard actually makes them more attractive to women and will grow one explicitly to appear sexier.  A man really doesn't need to do much, though, to keep women from approaching him.  Most men only need to do nothing.|`|XwqePXrOaa	People who are depressed or withdrawn tend to neglect their appearance, if that's what you're asking.|`|6qPTQDdZaa	I grow my beard out sometimes in the winter because I get tired of shaving.|`|aae04e3689e2835b454c72ee27fc318aaa	I thought it was just because it's hockey play off season?

EogAAkV4aa	The national debt is the gross accrued spending by the federal reserve on anything that isn't balanced by the USA's home assets. This includes taking out loans with international governments and corporations, and even loans with itself.<br>  <br>    The inflation rate is pretty constant,though recently has been driving prices down comparatively, either way, national debt has to be perfectly tacked onto the rate of inflation for accuracy, although it's a guess for all it's worth.<br>  <br>  It is and will continue to be paid back by taxpaying citizens (EVERYONE) in the USA in small increments in the form of taxes - however it is unlikely that national debt will ever be 0 because come on thats a huge number.
3vmmvRdYaa	I understand exactly where you are coming from. I had this same thing happen with me.<br>  I was so afraid and uncomfortable with the fact that people are most likely going to stare and/or acknowledge me. =p<br>  The way I got rid of the fear was having a close friend run with me most of the time. After a while, she slowly stopped running with me(because that was part of the plan) and I decided to take it into my own hands and go running by myself. If I could go run with her, then I can run on my own, for my own benefit.<br>  At least you're getting some exercise. Think of all the people who are probably thinking "Wow, I wish I had the time/courage to do that."<br>  Hope this could help.|`|TyTFTIJOaa	When you see people you know, smile and wave, or ignore unless they wave back. And I think I know why you have this fear, don't worry about it, you're just doing your own thing. Use that Nike thing: Just do it.

Good Luck! ^^|`|CR7arBmbaa	Just put your headphones on and turn up the volume. Stare at the sidewalk and block everything else out.

AA11562326	Well, yes, there's that scary element about contacting intelligent life, in that they may just see us as a food source or something.  Until recently, we didn't give much thought to the lives of fishes, and used the ocean as our toilet.<br>  <br>  But if we find evidence of life more advanced than us, that might have spiritual benefit.  Right now, there's a temptation to think of ourselves as the masters of the universe, and finding someone smarter would take us down a peg.  This is something that people of faith have long known - that there is something greater than us, here.|`|nN3UNKLgaa	well "science" claims that life cannot exsist outside of our planet because of the climatic conditions and the variation in atmosphere.

85gJHDbNaa	For something as personal as sex, you have to work your way up, pushing your comfort zone one step at a time. I have a hard time with sex because I was molested as a child, so the memory comes back to me whenever I try to have sex. The best way to go about this is to work your way up, making sex as sweet and comfortable as possible (having sex softly and romantically with the lights off or dimmed, rather than going all out over the covers with the lights on.) After a while, you will find it as a natural and beautiful process rather than something to feel weird about or ashamed of.|`|2rUTU2csaa	I find this interesting.

lqI8QZ9Eaa	I totally agree. Its ironic that feminists - the people who are supposed to represent gender equality - have become the oppressors, and totally unable to recognise when someone genuinely is looking for gender equality. <br>  <br>  MRA movements like Fathers 4 Justice are doing exactly what the Suffragettes did 100 years ago. I guess that's progress for you...<br>  <br>  @ thisisradioclash: you are the troll my friend. A few days ago you were posing as Clash, a supposed MRA. You didn't even try to answer the question and just went in for a personal attack. Like I said, YOU are the troll.|`|e197cb3f4211de6521dcc6f8afc0358caa	I agree. Feminists think female victims trump all victims. And asking feminists their opinion on men is like asking Hitler his views on Jews.

Feminists have no mercy for men. They're not for equality anymore. If anything, people opposing them are for equality.|`|oVeGMNsLaa	Agreed, very muchly.  I think one of the big problems comes from the fact that there are a lot of anti-feminist trolls who use the same argument not as a real way of discussing men's issues and critiquing feminism's role in avoiding them, but rather just as a way to hate on feminism.  So, understandably, a lot of us ignore them because we think they're trying to purposefully slander us as hypocrites, instead of actually listening.<br>  <br>  But I will admit that it's hard for me to understand men's issues, male oppression, and men's shame.  I am still looking for good, non-biased (read: not angry at feminists, but working together with them) websites and resources describing male oppression, so that I can get a better understanding of it.|`|fDGPbwdsaa	This fits my experience too.<br>  <br>  No offense intended to Gwennie, but she says she (and other feminists) will ignore anti feminists who use the same argument because they're angry...<br>  <br>  So, let me get this straight - the feminist movement blames men (for practically everything wrong in their personal lives as well as politically etc.) and we men are expected to take them seriously... while they - as acknowledged by Gwennie - are free to ignore men's issues. But, we're not allowed to be upset about that while they (feminists) have been free to send death threats, bombs, agenda-driven 'studies' designed only to blame men and so forth...<br>  <br>  Right. Just wanted to make sure I'd got that.
8sMWFD5Maa	Here is my take on the subject, <br>  <br>  A LOT of families had problems in the past and all too many of them resulted in Mom & Dad shouting at each other for hours on end, keeping the kids awake (some of the kids being very young) and these episodes continued sometimes for YEARS and the kids lost sleep and where seriously freaked out by Mom & Dad fighting.  And then the parents finally split up and the kids are left with one parent that they see most of the time and one parent they see only on weekends, or maybe some weekends, but not very often.<br>  <br>  The unfortunate result of this sort of thing is you get young adults in their 20's or even 30's who exhibit the VERY SAME symptoms as combat veterans with "shell shock" or "PTSD"<br>  <br>  As much as I know on this subject is that "PTSD" is not curable, it can be treated and controlled, but not eradicated, that is the nightmares will continue and only by way of training and self-control can these children of the domestic warfare lead "normal" lives.<br>  <br>  People need to THINK a LOT before they even have kids!<br>  <br>  Like, go fourth be fruitful and multiply .... ya, right <br>  we gonna over-breed and produce a generation of crazy people!<br>  NOT A GOOD IDEA!<br>  <br>  --- rant mode OFF ---<br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...|`|XR78voyOaa	Yes, problems including your emotions can (may) stain you for life (depending on what you might of experienced). Sometimes if something bad happens to you but you don't notice (your emotions or feelings change) it immediately after, it might just build up inside of you, then you might notice it later, but you feel more pain.|`|uhchod38aa	Depends on the nature of the problem. The problem may be solved but there may have been side-effects. For example, a person is severely diabetic and as a result suffers nerve damage. Later, the diabetic gets a pancreas transplant and is no longer diabetic. Diabetic problem solved but the nerve damage is irreversible. This is just an example. You can apply this line of thinking to numerous situations, problems, or trauma.|`|2724e8c32a9de71dca3f16697d9d6ebbaa	Yes, many people suffer from post traumatic stress disorder remembering traumatic experiences from the past.  Prime example: a young soldier who saw a lot of death in war.  Another:  a person who was molested or raped.
2inq4zHZaa	Well, it annoys me.  I think it's great to love where you are, who can argue with that?  I just really don't like being around someone that constantly degrades where I live and holds thier "home town" or whatever up on a pedestal.  I always say exactly what you said "why not go back there?" Go live where you are happy!  I live in Florida, and it is largely composed of people from everywhere except Florida for obvious reasons, and I hear this stuff all the time.  There are good things and bad things about every place you could possibly live.  There is no denying that.  Where I am grateful to live in the US, I have some very strong feelings as to why it is "not so good"  I love Florida, but seriously, it's humid all the time, it never snows, it's full of retired people and tourists that drive -5 mph, and it's flat as a pancake.  Not exactly the paradise that everyone describes in brochures.  It's not Disney Land everywhere.  Not to mention most work is seasonal in small towns, where all business comes from the "snow birds" that come down during winter months.  Agriculture is tough work as well.  So unless you are Mickey Mouse himself, good luck finding a job.  I remember taking French in highschool, and our teacher was American, from New England I believe.  I thought she was one of the most arrogant people I had ever met!  She actually believed she was French, and constantly put down America, and Americans, just for not being French I guess.  It never made sense to me.  This was an interesting question, thanks for posting it :)|`|5c907c92a6c7447ccb431133ac7208abaa	Since many ppl find it hard to even love their kids unconditionally, I fail to understand how ppl can feel that way about their state or country. I don't think others are superior, I just don't think my country is wonderful either (US). I see the great things about the US and the awful things about it, but a lot of ppl don't look at stuff very deeply, especially when it concerns their nationalism or ethnocentrism. I think Americans are extremely arrogant. I've traveled to most of the states and a few other countries, and am often embarrassed by the incredibly stupid things Americans say and do. <br>  <br>  f I have to hear one more transplant to my state say how backward we are, I'm going to tell them to pack and leave now. I'm quite aware of how backward we are, and how elitist they are. I don't know why ppl think that in the US the south is the only place that has racism, sexism and homophobia, but I"ve lived in many other parts of the country, and they have it too.|`|uXqDYPNVaa	Tell me about it. I think Canada is a great place, for the most part, but there are very few opportunities here for people who want to become commentators on the political scene; it's just too boring.|`|6qPTQDdZaa	Every place has its good points, but they also have their bad points.  Not acknowledging them is just foolish.  I live in Mississippi and can talk about all the good food, good writers, good hospitality, etc. all day, but we also have a dark side, which in our case is usually the side that is promoted by our good media:  racism and poverty.  To ignore them would be to ignore a big chunk of our history that has shaped us.|`|nhZb43pIaa	I think they are lucky. <br>  I would love to live in a dream world like that.<br>  <br>  Just last night I asked on GWS forum what country you think has the best overall standard of living. <br>  I only got 4 answers. Boo.<br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong, I love the USA, I love my country, but I have noticed that everyone who travels overseas say's how much nicer people seem. I don't know, maybe Americans are mean??? Sometimes I think I would like to live in another country, some where not so crowded.|`|I15Wjrcmaa	Well...I'm probably considered highly unqualified to answer this question because I'm from Texas. And you thought the French were arrogant?...lol.  <br>  <br>  It truly is amazing though, how people seem to consider their home area to be the best in the world. I mean...give me a break...who chooses to live in North Dakota? Kidding!...I'm just kidding. <br>  <br>  I think it's great that people are able to love their home.|`|Y7YC2FzZaa	can you phrase your answer in the form of a question?|`|xSKVLa6qaa	It is (Just kidding). There's nothing wrong with being proud, maybe there IS no place like California, but it does get old after a while. But whether or not that's true, a terrible stance to take is "If its so great, then go back!" Someone told my friend to go back there, but they didn't know he was from Bosnia. They got chewed out for a while about telling a refugee to go back to a war zone. There might be circumstances that make it impossible to return.<br>  <br>  <br>  To CC: Australia is not a city. It is a country and a continent.|`|LEFH6Snmaa	OK.. for one that teacher is CRAZY, but I totally understand what he's saying.. I agree that if they talk about how much there place is great they should go back, me, I like everyone different, everyone needs to have a different personallity and that no one should be the same|`|aae04e3689e2835b454c72ee27fc318aaa	Getting too supportive of your own country or state is border line fascist.<br>  <br>  @Blue B: Sydney Australia is probably my favourite city in the world.

I love the USA enough that I went to war to fight for it.|`|CjxwKrHzaa	Nothing is great in Australia at the moment.  Bushfires, cyclones, earthquakes, floods and recession....and that's just this year.|`|emOhSyY5aa	That all stems from being a closed minded individual.

qIVy4eloaa	i think you have premonisions or something like that. maybe your mind knows something is wrong but unfortunately you cant figure it out it just comes out of you without you knowing. you know something wrong will happen because you feel something that you cant explain. its natural. alot of people experience those things so dont worry. <br>  <br>  Many people find it hard to accept something or some decision. You're good because your body knows how to. I think you can overcome problems eaily because of your nature.<br>  <br>  Somethings wrong but you cant figure it out is your problem. if that keeps going, maybe you should see a therapist or someone like that.|`|hmL1Jtkmaa	your pathetic|`|YzArBxQFaa	Sounds like you are depressed, my dear.
2eztcCO0aa	Did you hear about the club for procrastinators?  It has millions of members, but only a few hundred have gotten around to joining.<br>  <br>  You're a procrastinator.  It's a learned behavior, reinforced by the fact that you seem to get done what you need despite waiting until the last minute.  The extra pressure of running out of time may be a good motivator for you.  (I know it works for me.)<br>  <br>  You can also learn not to procrastinate.  Pick one thing and decide not to procrastinate about doing it ever again.  In a few weeks, pick something else.  Keep going.<br>  <br>  Here's my favorite joke about procrastination:  I used to procrastinate all the time, but then I got so tired of doing it that I started to put it off.  :-D|`|XR78voyOaa	You don't have a disease or a disorder. Its just basically your habits. You maybe use to putting things off till the last minute. Its called procrastination, as everyone knows. All you have to do to get rid of this is just simply brake your habits. Force yourself to get up early in the mornings, maybe take a shower after you get up. Just start doing things, that you usually put off,  as soon as you get them. By doing this you are creating Good Habits.|`|fTrlerk7aa	Procrastination is just a bad habit that everyone has to get over sometime in their life. I myself haven't gotten over that bad habit, but what is helping me come over this habit is that me and a friend who is also a procrastinator are encouraging each other to do things a little early. Trust me, it is soooo much easier to get over a habit if someone you are close to is trying to get over it with you!!!|`|FjqJs7gMaa	no you just dont put your mind(& body) into things.|`|asLXvRBNaa	you just sound tired|`|myG2hhaKaa	A lot of people tend to procrastinate. Some people actually work better, under a little bit of pressure.<br>  <br>   I read an interesting article about procrastination not too long ago on Yahoo, actually. There are alot of perfectionist procrastinators out there, too (I think I'd fall in this case of procrastination.) Why do they put things off? Well, perfectionists tend to want to do a good job in everything- they want to be perfect. When they come across something that they think is difficult, they tend to get frightened and afraid they will fail, so they put it off til later.
lqI8QZ9Eaa	I bet Oxford isn't too happy that one of their scientists has turned out to be a loon. However they would be a LOT less happy if Sykes had published the same thing about women, Black people, Jews etc. <br>  <br>  The reality is that Sykes (and Oxford) will make a few quid in the short term and gain a few feminist buddies, but my sense is that this sort of thinking has had its day. Eugenics was once a popular and academically respected notion, and like eugenics, all the cranky theories inspired by the modern feminist movement are starting to look old and ugly. <br>  <br>  The day when people wake up to modern feminism in the same way that they woke up to eugenics is the day that people like Sykes, Greer, Oakley and the rest will be viewed as the cranks and pseudo-academics that they truly are.|`|iE9mpb11aa	I don't know, maybe they would post questions about it over, and over, and over and over and over and over and over and over.......<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  And over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.<br>  <br>  And wouldn't you think they were just a little nuts for it?<br>  <br>  <br>  Of course it is. That doesn't make you any less crazy, for all that it's a free country.|`|DtILThwAaa	Who ever has done more evil as a gender would deserve to be the one  hypothetically wiped out while the other remains. Men do some bad sh!t, but women have dwarfed the number of humans killed by men since the dawn of man through abortion. I would choose fixing women's brains through natural selection and genetic engineering over wiping them out. Men's brains could use some fixing too, but don't need it nearly as bad as women.|`|df3bacf9451198fdc8a33199106b5652aa	Very entertaining.<br>  Just to say that none, no matter how many degrees s/he is able to master during his/her lifetime, is above doubt and criticism.<br>  <br>  Beyond that, ill just keep laughing to the responds of angry pseudo-feminists. And i surely look ahead when the next idiot remembers to diminish the role and value of the lives of half the population of earth.. let alone a whole gender.<br>  <br>  Women can be, and are just as stupendous as men.<br>  <br>  As for MA PhD DSc Bryan Sykes, professor of human genetics,<br>  well.. to me he doesnt mean a thing. And i shall treat him as such, by not even bothering to talk about him ever again. He is nothing.<br>  <br>  edited: indeed it is a free country, and none will stop either you or sykes from expressing your opinions nomatter how pathetic they are. we all have better things to do (that includes doing nothing at all).|`|YwE5kIB8aa	I say good on him.  He saw a market, wrote a book that strokes that markets ego, and voila, he sells books.  I challenge someone to write  a book saying the exact opposite.  It'll sell big time.

And you can continue posting and reposting ridiculous questions about it.  See how that works?  Everyone wins.  Except the rest of us who don't really want to hear from either of you.|`|PJAU0lFBaa	Becoming a tenured academic does not make one immune to insanity.  It seems like this fellow has fallen off the deep end.  Obviously nobody of any credibility will take his nonsense seriously.  It's about time Oxford relegated him to emeritus status and removed him from teaching.  He has certainly become an embarrassment to the institution.|`|Lx9bVRGyaa	Wow, talk about self-loathing.  I wonder if he realizes that it's mostly men who pay his salary.|`|7EV9fqM3aa	Neither women nor men are perfect. Someday, in the future, we may be able to grow babies with both artificial sperm and eggs in incubators. Who cares?<br>  <br>  Women are as imperfect and as perfectly human as men and vice versa. We're all just people. That's it. Luckily, we can fit quite nicely together in so many ways. <br>  <br>  Anatomically we are different but that's it. Psychologically and intellectually we have the same potential.<br>  <br>  And this is feminism. Women need men and men need women. We can live, quite easily, without each other but we work better, enjoy life more, with each other.<br>  <br>  Stop reading the feminazi propaganda and assuming it represents all of feminism. Our equality is your equality. Real feminists, those of us who adore men and embrace the physical differences, and, even, lick them, realize that the differences between us are physical and nothing more.<br>  <br>  Men are irrelevant only when women are, too. Only when we are both just people.|`|emOhSyY5aa	You see the problem is that of being misunderstood. I call myself a humanist because I do not agree with ALL that feminist believe in. Nor do I believe in misogyny. But I am strongly opposed to the feminist who swear that they stand for equality but yet they are fully aware of the hatred for men that some of this promotes. So why is it that they call themselves feminist? Why not just say they are humanist or equalist? There is no point in me telling a person it is wrong to oppress if I agree with oppressing the oppressors! That would be turning my beliefs upside down. That's a paradox.

zB7Gz8R5aa	I would say maybe you still care a lot about him, but you realize you can't have him (you are in a hang glider, he is on the ground) and/or that having him means losing some happiness or freedom in your life.<br>  <br>  You are soaring in the sky, and from the sounds of it enjoying it, so that usually resorts to freedom as you can go any where you want, no obstacles. The fact that he is on the ground either means there is a lot separating you and you have to give up the flight, or that he doesn't have that freedom that you have. The fact that you were watching him I think means you still care, even knowing this, but him not looking back means maybe he doesn't so much.<br>  <br>  Keep in touch with him, but do what you need to do in life.

m5eHZvPfaa	I'll be happy to share what I do for major depression.<br>  <br>  <br>  What I do is a lot of soul searching: Where do I see myself in life, where do I want to be, how honest is my desire, how critical are the hurdles I put myself up against...in the end, I try my best to stand back from myself and let go of all the things I think is important - this includes my views of being alone - sometimes there are superficial worries that 'disguise' themselves as being profound. I also find I need to evaluate what "alone" is and whats having me view myself as "alone". The alone we feel is really a void in our lives of something else, something that we are in need of, and the tough part is often figuring out what the heck that is, and how do we obtain it. The frustration from this void can tend to cause even more "alone" feelings. <br>  <br>   I have been fortunate to speak with counselors, but sometimes I notice stagnation with them...I get tired of talking about it, I don't see it taking me anywhere. So here's a good tactic I use, and it works, especially as the months go by - journals, I get open and honest and upfront with myself, very personal, so I make sure to keep my journals in private places away from other eyes. I write about what my life has looked like for me, I write about how I feel/felt, I write about what I want and WHY I want it, I write about my experiences and how I relate to what has happened, I go into real dissection of everything, my pen and paper become communication for my soul. I keep all these writings, and I look back at them in the next couple months, and I continue this process, over years even. I find a deep discovery of whats really going on with me and just what I need to do about it. <br>  <br>  I'm currently trying new meds, I'm reconsidering counseling, I'm trying to create a habit of getting myself out into the world more, and just really trying to heal my emotions - alcohol is scientifically documented to worsen our feelings, however, once in a while, ONCE in a WHILE I will have a drink to calm my hurt, sometimes I just really want a break - but the majority of time I make a deliberate effort to be strong and deal with the hurt, I just have to get tough, period. I emphasis  the majority of time I make a deliberate effort to be strong and deal with the hurt, I just have to get tough, period. <br>  <br>  You know I wonder how long you've been taking Lexapro...one thing about antidepressants as you probably know too is that it can take up to two months before we see results. But if by chance you've been taking it for two months or longer, you may just need to try a new medication. I've tried antidepressants and I have different opinions on different ones. You can email me about my opinions. Also, are you seeing a counselor as well?<br>  <br>  It sounds like you are doing good things to help you rise above your depression, however, it sounds like there are concerns that need to be solved in your life or mental outlook...medicine, exercise, and social interaction are but a part of the healing package. <br>  <br>  <br>  You can email me and I'll be glad to partner with you on whats going on.  I have a very strong shoulder.<br>  <br>  Take care.|`|T547TtDRaa	I found that if I volunteered somewhere where people were less well off than I am, it boost my self-esteem by helping the less fortunate.  I also tried volunteering in a hospital.  That helped me get over feeling blue.<br>  <br>  I also developed a hobby that involved being around other people.  I enjoy ballroom dancing.  Getting involved in a club that you enjoy that has other members is excellent, too.  Or get involved in an organization that you can use your strong skills in.  Look in your local newspaper, or local newsletters for groups that meet in your area.<br>  <br>  You might find a religious organization that you like that has members that are your age.<br>  <br>  A great idea for you is to see if you have a local Mental Health Association in your area.  They are usually located in larger cities.  There you can be in a peer support group where you can make new friends, too.<br>  <br>  There are support groups on-line, too, if you live in an isolated area.  Getting involved in a regular daily activity that is outside of your home can be a benefit to your feeling better.<br>  <br>  Going to a mall where other people are can help, too.<br>  <br>  I hope that I have given you some ideas.|`|F4aJ3LTTaa	Staying busy really helps.

FORCE yourself to hang out with friends and get out of the house. i know it doesn t sound fun, but it helps.|`|9YbMZBocaa	I've found that not giving a f*ck about things really helps to think clearly.  The more I don't give a f*ck the less pressure I feel from myself and outside parties. <br>  <br>  I often realized I was alone when I was around friends who I should have able to trust, which is quite ironic.  lately I can tell you i've burned bridges with those people for good.  I can say lately not giving a f*ck about alot of things has put me into a very relaxed and calm mindstate.  If I was the type to smoke, i'd light a fat spliff but I don't so I just sit down and play the piano.<br>  <br>  Overall I would say do things that help you relax, and put you into a state of mind where you can be more aware of yourself, your situation and the people around you.|`|EgA87yR0aa	I have been diagnosed with this before.

First of all, lay off the drugs... these bad boys will cause more harm than good. When you feel depressed try calling a very good friend and just talk. You can spend the day reading informative stuff or just novels. You can also turn it into a movie day (don't forget the popcorn :D). Next time you go out for a walk bring a couple of good friends along and crack some jokes. The most important thing to remember is: you are never alone. This depression probably has a cause, maybe you're thinking about something... try finding out what it is and just deal with it :)|`|TPFWiUEXaa	Wow i really wish i could help you i have super bad depression as well basically at the brink of suicide every other night. The only thing that works for me is going out with friends but you said that doesn't help. I also like listening to music that always makes me feel better

0d3caea19e536c28c3c40b43bd786f99aa	Once again i have a dream encyclopedia and it states...."Because they travel up and down in space, elevators participate in the larger meaning of height and depth.  thus, an ascending elevator in a dream can mean almost anything from rising in status to rising in awareness, whereas one descending may mean lowered status or submerging into the depths of the unconscious.  in and of themselves, elevators are often regarded as threatening, because elevators we are often forced into close quarters with strangers and because they sometimes plummet down the elevator shaft, killing the passengers."   whoo that was a handful.|`|TyTFTIJOaa	So, you like elevators, huh? Heh... ok what I can tell you, that is, if you want these to stop or become different, is to try lucid dreaming. Every time you're in that elevator, look at a piece of writing, double check to make sure that the writing is the same every time. Make it habit. You see, in a dream, words tend to change the second or third tiem you read them. If it's a habit, and you do this while dreaming, then you'll catch yourself, and probably be able to figure out what's wrong til you wake up. Lucky, you get a recurring dream.... it would be so much easier to lucid dream when you can do that lol.<br>  <br>  As far as interpretations, do you ever feel stuck in a path or schedule? Change it every once in a while. Do something unexpected. And if you like the elevator dreams, then you probably like whatever's causing them too. Good Luck! ^^|`|380b53c18cfb9588bad18dd0f231a984aa	One opinion:  Elevator for you symbolizes your soul freedom.<br>  In your dreams, you are free to move up and down in a regulated way, experiencing consciousness at all levels of your body, which is your building.  Your soul is your elevator, and the people who move with you symbolize daily relationships.<br>  <br>  Floating indicates your personalized, individualized consciousness as you move through life and day.<br>  <br>  "The Master of Lucid Dreams," Dr. Olga Kharitidi,<br>  <a href="http://www.dreamviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dreamviews.com</a><br>  "Watch Your Dreams," Ann Ree Colton,<br>  <a href="http://www.lucidity.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.lucidity.com</a><br>  "The Masters and Their Retreats," Mark Prophet,<br>  <a href="http://www.dreamhealer.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dreamhealer.com</a><br>  "Light Is A Living Spirit," O.

In most case of dreams anytime you are going up is a good sign, but going up and down. hmm. let me think.<br>  Cause with movin' on up in the elevator is up to the next level of life. Progression or digression depending on whether the elevator is going up or down. Elevate your mind and spirit. It's all confused..lol<br>  Being trapped in an elevator, the mind is letting you know you are not going anywhere just another area of your life whee you might feel stuck. Could be work or family or friends.<br>  Floating means: Ability to rise above the ordinary or to rise above a tough situation. If floating and can't get down could be your subconscious telling you to come back down to Earth, ground yourself, stop hanging around, etc.<br>  School means: Time to learn a lesson or educate yourself on certain matters. You may be feeling tested or that you need to pass a particular situation with flying colors. Do you have a fear of failure? <br>  <br>  Hope that helps to solve the strange elevator rides. Good dreams
L8XP51rdaa	Sleep it off, or take a nice shower.|`|bljEhh86aa	join the club.|`|TyTFTIJOaa	Number 1. Find every positive about yourself, think it over in your head or if you feel like it, write them down. Remind yourself. That's step one. Number 2. Look at the positives around you. See a wedding? Look, those people are having fun! A funeral? The persons in a better place, not in this (sometimes) screwed up world. (can be fun tho lol) Everything crashing down around you? There's your life ahead of you, and other people havebeen through what you have. Drive through the tough times and slow down when you hit the fun ones. Number 3. Think of what you want to be happy, like specific things or people, then hold on to it.... think about it every once in a while, imagine what it would be like. <br>  <br>  The whole idea is positive thinking. I'm not saying it will be like in "The Secret" where everything is drawn to you, but there's some solid fact in it: Think positive, see positive, feel positive. Get it? If not, you can email me, I have loads I could talk about lol. Good Luck!|`|9ZCLZXZyaa	Try smiling more.  It is a feedback loop.  If you smile more, you will be happier and you will smile more.  You just have to start the loop.  Also, try changing or avoiding the things that make you sad - your job, friends, family, other people.  Take pleasure in the small things - the beauty of a dandelion, the sound of children laughing, the motion of the waves.  Look at the good things and not the bad.
TyTFTIJOaa	Don't mourn or get all sad when you could be having fun, and it's true....when I'm sad I just go find one of my friends or something, do what I can for now, then think about when I have time. I tend to put thinking off until I can't laugh anymore or have fun, like right before I go to bed.

8QdtFVe2aa	I suggest you start with a financial history book. The best on the market is "The Ascent of Money" by Niall Ferguson, a Harvard financial historian. This will ground you in the intuition of the economics of financial markets.<br>  <br>  THEN, you can look at the formal theory. Economics for Dummies is a good book, but it is about economic in general - not the economics of finance specifically. A great textbook in this area is "Economics of Money, Banking, and Financial Markets" by Mishkin - it is very well-written, and uses minimal mathematics. Of course, you should be comfortable with basic economics concepts (supply and demand, opportunity cost) to be able to get the most out of this book.|`|1d02fcff81d2bb070fc361fbe28e3606aa	Economics for Dummies is really good.  Written very well and in easy to understand language.

For me, it's when I've been athome all day then I go out with my friends.... so happy lol|`|P5nrBj1baa	In our capitalistic and superficial society, happiness is always short-lived.  It's sporadic.  Whenever you purchase something you've long waited for, or began a new relationship with someone whom you've lusted after or been attracted to, or when you have children, job promotion. These are all things that cause Euphoria.  The caveat is that this short-lived happiness has to inevitably subside because its the nature of things.<br>  <br>  For example when you begin a new job or get a job promotion of course your excited initially but then if your ambitious you want more, or you develop enemies because of this success, ergo happiness goes away.  Children are a source of happiness, however, when they do mischievous things or get in trouble, this takes away that happiness.  A new relationship, can cause happiness but it can also become stagnant due to many years together and infidelity could lead to the antitheses of happiness etc.|`|ZJkwz1B5aa	Satisfying one's needs, wants, and goals.

Today there is no reason to be depressed, you can take antidepressants.  Depression is an organic condition, it is part of you biological make up and some thing is just a bit off kilter.  Like having a vitamin or iron deficiency.  If you take the right antidepressants it will seem like the black cloud just went away.  But be patient,  sometimes it takes 2 or 3 trys to get the right medication and then you have to make sure you don't have side effects that are too bad.  Don't worry the side effects are not really bad, just stuff like it might keep you up at night, or constipation but mostly nothing too bad &if it is,  you try another one.  <br>  <br>  There is also a depression quiz, Ann Landers & Dear Abby used to publish it every year,  I'm sure it is online.  Ask your family Dr to recommend  a doctor to see or maybe they will prescribe something.

Dreams are the language of the unconscious - it speaks in pictures and emotions, sometimes very clever hidden jokes.  <br>  <br>  Dreams are whatever they are.  If you become mentally ill, however, dreams will come to your aid and gradually explain the illness.  That's why psychoanalysis uses them as the 'royal road to the unconscious'.<br>  <br>  But if you're not mentally ill, then just have fun with your dreams - they sometimes will have meaning and sometimes it seems they are only psychic housecleaning - a sort of Harry Potter world of magic and mayhem.|`|qlDe6N6gaa	Dude your freakin.<br>  you need to relax abit.<br>  they are just dreams.<br>  and as far as them having a meaning.<br>  just look at it and think outside the box.<br>  like, "what am i trying to tell/show myself".

FU4TyghIaa	consider just walking away and looking for a new therapist.<br>  Sure, it's bad and even illegal to give this kind of advice, but it might be that reporting it will just bite you.  If the therapist finds out or suspects it was you that reported it.  She sounds weird and who knows?  Might not want to aggravate her?  Sounds like she's capable of anything?|`|ParFJxnSaa	Find a new one, ASAP!  It depends to a certain extent on what your tentative diagnosis is: people with Borderline Personality Disorder, for example, need to be challenged from time to time, by therapists using DBT. A good therapist will get you to examine the appropriateness of your actions, or thought patterns, and offer the occasional suggestion.<br>  <br>  Some therapists, however, work from an "I know best" basis, and, even though they may actually do know best, their approach often isn't as conducive to progress as others, who take more of a middle position. On the other hand, there are those who try to be your friend, when what you really need is expert help. I suggest that you try at least 3 new therapists, and initially select one you feel most comfortable with, because a good degree of rapport (which takes time to build) can help a lot, with therapy. Closely examine the <a href="http://1-800-therapist.com/" rel="nofollow">http://1-800-therapist.com/</a> & <a href="http://www.metanoia.org/choose/" rel="nofollow">http://www.metanoia.org/choose/</a> websites, and use the locators, there, and/or in the index page of section 1, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> (and phone book, but only if necessary). Personally, I'd select a clinical psychologist who believes in only recommending minimal necessary medication, if at all, because they don't issue prescriptions, so are considerably less likely to be involved with the rewards, and inducements offered by sales reps from "big pharma": the large drug companies, to psychiatrists (there are links to, or articles on how psychiatry has become corrupted by money from drug companies, and "how doctors are being manipulated", in section 1: worth reading!). <br>  <br>  It's important to not only feel comfortable with your therapist, but also to know about their qualifications, and the type of therapy used (read section 1). Some people are in therapy for many years, and pay a small fortune in fees, so recognise that therapists may have a vested interest in keeping their patients coming back. It pays the rent, and permits them to feel that they are fulfilling a useful function in life. <br>  <br>  For this reason, I believe that, unless there is a need for a specific type of therapy, such as Dialectical Behavio(u)ral Therapy, for Borderline Personality Disorder, or EMDR therapy, for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, or ongoing support, in the case of people with bipolar disorder, who find they function best this way, it is a good idea to start out with a clinical psychologist who uses Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy. It often can accomplish all it is capable of, in 6 months, and to fix that time limit in the first session. In that way, the therapist knows that there is only a limited window of opportuntiy to do what they can, and there is no unconscious motivation to attempt to draw things out. <br>  <br>  If, at the end of that time, you believe you could benefit from a little more therapy, then you can extend it, but I'd advise the therapist a few weeks before the final session, in case they are considering taking on a new patient, leaving you "high, and dry" committed, and without options, except to find someone else. Learn to assess, and rate your therapist, after a while: sometimes it's better to move on, and find someone who you feel can help you more, but not if you've just reached an unpleasant part of the therapy, which part of you would rather avoid.|`|d3a0051575f0ca9e98fa14121e4cf6e8aa	Hum,,,sounds like you should wake up and realize that maybe you don't need that type of therapy.|`|CU1WRghVaa	................I think ur that consular has problems, I think its illegal and you call probably sue that therapist cuz shes not helping you and ................. yea <br>  <br>  You should probably find a new therapist shes just wasting ur time money and patient.

mbfMYmzWaa	~You say you feel invisible, but what exactly does that mean? I assume you mean that whenever you approach a girl she'll just shut you down? Well clearly you're either approaching them in the wrong way, or approaching them with the wrong intentions or (most likely) approaching the wrong kind of girls. Try approaching the shy one in the corner... and instead of thinking "I'm going to need a paper bag when we get into bed" try thinking "I bet myself I can make her smile" if you stop viewing girls as potential lovers, you'll find it so much easier to be have contact with them. Girls can pick up vibes from three doors down. (Man, I miss that band). Anyway, if you go in there not expecting anything, and not asking for anything (other than offering your company) there's far less grounds for her to reject you on. Also, when they DO reject you- have a big glass of harden the f** up and get over it bro. Tailor your approach so you won't have the same problem with the next girl and go again. Theres going to be a girl one day who DOESN'T not want to be mates with you, and she'll show you how to relax around girls. From then you can make friends with another, and another, and they might introduce you to others... anyway, eventually you'll be able to act 'normal' enough around them to have something more intimate. <br>  <br>  ~Try to appear more positive even when you feel like an absolute piece of **** too. If you act it, you'll feel it, and vice versa eventually (although the shitter you feel, the longer it'll take to feel better by acting it.) <br>  <br>  ~ Contacts on a WEBSITE mean absolutely NOTHING...sure, they're real people behind the words- but they're just cyber versions, so only half people. just because your a contact shouldn't mean your obliged to answer someone's question either ... you answer and respond if you 1. find it interesting, 2. want to share your answer AND 3. think you have an answer actually worth sharing. Don't take it so personally kid. That's why I deleted all of mine in the first place!!! ugh.<br>  <br>  ~ You might be lonely but you certianly ain't alone. Even though it doesn't feel like it, there are so SO many people in  your position, both guys AND girls. Why do you think the psychology industry's always booming? <br>  <br>  ~This part (if you're still acutally reading) is important. The approval of the opposite sex is NOT the answer you're looking for. I know what you're thinking "She has no idea what it's like for a dude to go 42 years with out sex or so much as a wink from a chick" but honestly, it sounds like the whole 'girl/contact' thing is just a manifestation of your actual issues... like depression maybe. I had depression, but after a while I convinced myself it was because I was lonely too, and if I was more attractive it'd get better, which then "manifested" into real self image issues (which is ridiculous, cause I'm better off than most, but that's just a common way of girls my age's brains of processing their problems). The point is, your feelings aren't going to be fixed by "having sex" of "finding a gf" or getting lots of answers on Y!A. lol.  The real long term fix is much more complicated than that (just think of all those freaking 'self help' books out there... that's why they're written). Once you start actaually DOING things to fix your sadness or anger, or hate towards your mother, or low self esteem, or antisocialism, or whatever the 'root' to your problems are, you'll find your 'sexual frustration' won't become such a big deal... and ONLY then do you have any chance at getting a network of girl aquaintences, let alone forming good friendships with girls, let ALONE relationships that go any deeper than that.<br>  <br>  ~Try not to take things so personally, and even if you do internally... just lie to yourself. Pretend it doesn't bother you and you think it's petty & eventually your subconcious will catch up with your actual thoughts. <br>  <br>  ~ Try to remember that we all sometimes wants what we can't have... It's only when we're ok with having absolutely nothing, that we can be happy when we DO have stuff. Otherwise you can get and take and succeed and win and own but still be miserable because there's ALWAYS going to be something/someone out there that's better, or that you haven't got. <br>  <br>  ~Try changing in other ways, if you change your environment or actions, then it makes sense that you'll change internally... and peoples reactions towards you will change too. Take a risk... join more clubs, volunteer, look for a new job, take a vacation, study something interesting (my vice is psychology and criminology). All these things will also mean that you're changing (improving) your social surroundings aswell. <br>  <br>  ~Occupy your mind with other thoughts & that will give you ammo to talk about with your potential girl FRIENDS (NOT girlfriends... no offence, but it sounds like you're not ready for that no matter HOW much you "need" one.) If YOU have interests that THEY find interesting, then YOU'LL BE INTERESTING. Try watching more movies rather than just car racing or sport...<br>  <br>  ~If you really DO want usefull contacts, you're going to have to get more than just that... add people more freely, make more of an effort, and ask questions you think girls might actually respond to. <br>  <br>  ~The only reason people seem to have so many contacts that answer their questions is that the featured questions and the people we see are more than likely going to be the Y!A whores that are allways on here adding people and asking questions and answering... 24/7... they'll be answering the same peoples questions and working on their Y!A network. Maybe read up on social neworking a bit so you can get a better perspecitve on the issue. Try that 'how to make friends and influence people' book... or something like that (I haven't read it though, so I can't say whether or not it's a load of bull, maybe go for a less mainstream one if you don't like supporting those cult-status authours..)|`|9851deb6f5776ae6834cf0b79571e624aa	I do not think this will have a positive response by a lot of girls. I could be wrong though.|`|8SyUHkPXaa	This is not reality, this is your online gratification.  You can't expect more from this.<br>  <br>  You need to get a wide variety of contacts and not take the rejects so personally.  <br>  <br>  I'm sorry that you are so frustrated; I think everyone feels this way to one extent or the other.

I attribute that partly to being bipolar which makes me ultra-sensitive to events & people around me. Sometimes I cry for my lost past & the changes I can't make or decisions I can't undo. Other times it's a reaction to joyous things like the first time I saw my grandsons when they were newborns. Or it could be from one of the incredible sunrises we have here. It's like being given a reprieve from a sleepless night & I despair of getting anything accomplished & suddenly I realize that's behind me & I have all new opportunities ahead of me. At times it's grieving for those who have passed that I never fully mourned. It can even be sheer joy of feeling something--even if it's painful.

But in spite of that if you just want to cry for the sake of crying says there may be deeper issues that must be dealt with.  <br>  <br>  The last time I cried was in February 2005, after I had lost my job of 4 years.

IhNWpsr4aa	in todays world happiness comes from getting something you dont have. we have standards, and if you could graph them the life of some perfect society whre there is no crime would be nearly flatlined, and say if you just lost a job but then met your soulmate or something it would have wide fluctuations. for some odd reason though we notice the unhappy parts much more than the good parts. we "appreciate" the bad times way more than we do the good. im not sure exactly why that happens but thats why life can seem so bad with a hard to reach light at the end of the tunnel.|`|NuJako4gaa	I dont know right now im happy :)<br>  but some days i will be sad but happy again probably!!<br>  <br>  answer my question plzz:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtrT4_u0pOTuTltWYa6HkZnsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307091042AA7mhrG">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|ngDjTbTnaa	Cause we are greedy...we want more and more till we have everything we want...then we try to get friends and family we have lost....and none of the material stuff matters.....long story short, if you can't be happy now with what you have, you'll never get happy with whatever you hope you'll get in the future.....|`|uPsdobh6aa	Happiness is a rare thing but is available to anyone who wants it.

ParFJxnSaa	Use the following method: It's important to regularly monitor, and deal with a negative internal monologue (self talk), or mental process, such as disturbing thoughts, images, impulses, or emotions, by the process of (a): recognising it, and (b): challenging it immediately. <br>  <br>  Technique For Re-Programming Negative Thoughts: When you notice something negative, such as: "I can't do this/ am never going to get over this!" or: "Why am I always so pathetic/useless/such a loser?" or even an image, emotion, or a memory; recognise that it is being generated from the negative part of your mind. Having identified and labelled it, visualise a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" <br>  <br>  You may want to use either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick". In the case of an image, visualise a large "STOP" sign, or your preferred version. <br>  <br>  Some people go so far as to keep a wide rubber band in their pocket, then put it around their wrist, when they catch themselves backsliding, stretch and release it, as a method of reprogramming their mind sooner, but I don't regard it as being strictly necessary. Remember to remove it, afterwards, if you use this method.|`|IWFI6ey4aa	ouch thats a tough one, i've been in a situation like that about a couple girls, its pretty annoying really.<br>  <br>  Just convince yourself that he isn't right for you.

PTnwi01Uaa	Where you get that from, secondary inaccurate articles, lol?? Porn about a couple doing it is fun, no I don't like watching girl on girl lesbian thing but rather the norm.

Personally I dont like porn because I think that it is cheezy and boring which is not sexy.  I dont judge ppl who like it though.  i  always thought that porn is aimed at men because men are more visual creatures than women and they need a visual aide to masturbate too.  I find that i dont need visual aids to pleasure myself.  I dont think what the above person said about 'truly sexy women getting turned on about porn' because i consider myself a very sexual person - i enjoy sex a lot but i personally am not turned on by porn because I dont think thats how ppl have sex in real life - instead its just cheezy!  In lots of porn, the men just hammer away at some woman with fake boobs and she orgasms after like 30 seconds whereas in reality most woman need lots of foreplay, espicially clitoral stimulation to orgasm!  I find that a lot of porn just reinforces the sterotype that sex is only for men - ie its all about penetration yet most women can not orgasm through penetration alone.  I happen to like GOOD sex, not pornographic sex.  Just cause there are two naked ppl going at it on screen, well thats not enought to get me going, sorry.|`|Oh9wfPFeaa	alot of straight women are ashamed to admit thet they watch porn or even masturbate because it takes somthing away from their "womenhood"...just like there are some things that men wont ever admit to doing because they thing it will take away from their "manhood"|`|mZVk3fP4aa	Most porn is made for male enjoyment.|`|lFzFtiCBaa	Those are the women I wanna know...lol|`|NnG8PxMzaa	All my chick friends are straight and they all watch porn.  Quite frequently too.  There must be something in the water where we live.  But odds are other women are just embarrassed by it.  It's a personal thing.  I can openly talk about how my stash of 'special friends' was discovered by a group of burly-*** men whereas some girls can't even admit to finding the thought of sex arousing.<br>  <br>  As for women not liking the fact that porn focuses a lot on the woman involved is actually untrue most of the time.  Studies show that most women are attracted to the female body, even if they are heterosexual.  <br>  <br>  And yeah, most guys in porn are painfully hideous, and I really don't have the highest of standards.  Although it doesn't really stop me, I just scroll down so I don't have to see his face.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I don't see where I made any reference to women being turned on by bestiality so I'm pretty sure you're talking about something else entirely.|`|ZMnD5s7laa	Honestly, I wish I knew- your right, the women I know that enjoy (or at least admit it) are bi and/or seem to be trashy or extremely gross to me-what I mean is it seems they don't respect themselves even tho they may say they do.<br>  <br>  I'm going to post a question asking why can't I get turned on by porn. I don't like it, even if it's something considered simple or extremely vulger-I just don't get turned on by it. I think one reason why women don't watch men having sex as much is becasue a man's body is not like a womans. A womsn's body is smooth and nice-feminie where as a man is bulky, and no effence towards any man but a penis in sight of itself is just gross (although it can do wonders in bed behind closed doors, lol) As far as lesbians, i can't really speak for but I'm sure one of the reasons is because they dont need to be turned on by porn or seeing another woman but their mate. They are mature enough to only be turned on by whom they date and/or are with.<br>  <br>  No feed back to me?|`|tyuxbdrnaa	All the bi-sexual females that I know are what I would call "extremely sexual people".<br>  We tend to be less inhibited, we don't feel restricted to adhere to any "sexual do's and don'ts".<br>  A truly "sexual" woman...gets turned on by porn.<br>  Not one that's withdrawn or inhibited.<br>  Many straight women have said, they like porn to some degree...but only if it's a certain way...and usually with their man...etc. (lots of conditions apply).<br>  As for why lesbian women wouldn't like it....<br>  and I don't personally know any on an intimate level, so I'm guessing...they would like girl on girl, I suppose and just vear away from straight porn. (???)|`|oVeGMNsLaa	I think you need to review some of your statistics on how many women watch porn: 1 in 3 visitors to adult websites are women, 9.4 million women access adult websites each month, 13% of women admit to accessing pornography at work, and 17% of women struggle with an addiction to pornography.  Mind you- these numbers are nowhere near the incredibly high statistics of men's porn consumption.  But to say that women don't watch porn is pretty far off-base.<br>  <br>  I do understand the idea that many women who watch porn are bisexual, since I also fall under that category.  But I will add in there that there are quite a few straight women who also watch porn.  The problem is that if you're straight (seriously straight, as in you don't like seeing naked women at all), and you don't like gay porn, you're kind of screwed, because in most porn out there, women are the focus.  It helps if you're bisexual- you can enjoy that.  There is some porn out there for straight women's tastes- Candida Royalle, InPulse Productions, Libido Films, etc., etc., but even those often throw in a girl/girl scene or put more focus on women, since it's competing with mainstream porn for a very lucrative audience.<br>  <br>  Oh, and right now, lesbian porn is totally undergoing a new revolution.  I suggest Googling "Pink & White Productions", "No Fauxxx", and finding out about how Shine Louise Houston is revitalizing porn for lesbians.|`|5f52c5c3d1d0deab80192fb888e39e9aaa	Ok. If I'm straight, why wouldn't I want to see sex that involves more images of the man as well as the woman. If I'm a lesbian, I might enjoy seeing more of women than men. In either case, normal, hetero porn is usually lacking. Many women are turned on by erotica and other things that highlight the buildup to the sexual act and then describe the actual sex in detail. Women of all sexual preferences love erotica. Have you considered that women are stimulated differently than men? <br>  <br>  Oh, and from being friends with lesbians, I know that their main attraction to other women is the thoughts of what women can do with each other in a sexual situation. They love women's bodies, but at the same time seem to focus on how it feels rather than the image itself.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying that women aren't turned on by watching people have sex, there are just other ways that work as well or better (depending on the person). There's nothing wrong with that. <br>  <br>  Bi people probably just like sex a lot with both genders. That doesn't make them better or worse partners than most. They're just different.|`|84gK4XlHaa	A lot of women like porn.  It's just like everyone masterbates, but only a few will admit to it.  Lesbians like it too, but for obvious reasons, probably not so much the straight kind.  I know a lesbian couple who own a few pieces of woman on woman porn.|`|nvH62xo5aa	bisexual women are more open sexually <br>  and straight women don't want to be seen as a "sl*t" for enjoying sex or even, god forbid, porn!|`|WKtakdsOaa	My best mate is 100% straight and she loves porn and has loads of it.

She has the pics all over her facebook and she is really into her|`|pzLDXL6gaa	It's entirely possible people who have admitted to being bisexual or bi-curious are in general more open about their sexuality and therefore admit to more things? That's just a guess but I picked it up from the way you phrased your question.<br>  <br>  Or maybe they enjoy more porn because there's no risk of "eye-slippage" for them...lol<br>  <br>  Also, there's a difference between getting turned on by porn and seeking it out and watching it...plus it depends on the porn, some of it is just cheesy and rubbish or disgusting and nobody normal could get turned on by that lol<br>  <br>  Harriet

Your dream may even be commenting on your dreaming life.<br>  <br>  To see your husband, your home will be filled with happiness and bright prospect will be yours.<br>  Hope that helps. Good dreams
AA10435220	This is an oversimplification but:<br>  <br>  Socialism:  You own 2 cows, the government takes them, stores them at a central facility where they are milked.  Then the government gives most of the milk to the people who can't or won't work and sells the remaining milk to those who still make money.<br>  <br>  Communism: Everyone who owns cows is killed and their cows are taken by the state to a state run facility.  The milk is mostly kept by those in power and they ration about 5% of the total milk produced for the rest of the population.  If you ask if there is a better way to get this done, you will be shot.<br>  <br>  Capitalism: You have 2 cows.  You sell 1 and buy a bull.  The cow and bull mate, produce more cows and bulls that you can sell, slaughter for meat to sell/eat, or keep.

I have no idea what they were and nobody will be able to do any better than guess.  <br>  <br>  My suggestion is to not dwell on it any more and let it fade away in your memory.  As you know, you haven't learned any more about them in the passing of the years, and all they do is frighten and upset you even now.<br>  <br>  Be sure you have a firm basis in your spirituality.

uE2k2wa6aa	I feel for you, I would start by seeing a sleep specialist, but it could be anxiety that has your mind raceing at night due to stress, you didnt state tho how long this has been happening because then it could be something more than just stress.. I wouldnt suggest any sleep medication because I have heard many horror stories about sleep walking, where the person would act totally awake, talking to their phone with no one on it, or driving to the store, just strange things. Their familys would tell them the story in the mornin of what happend and they have no clue what they are talkin about. I think you need to explain more of is the trouble you cannot turn your thoughts off or is it you are scared to sleep? I do think you need something for your nerves cause its sounding like stress is the major issue if this is a newer thing for you. I cannot help you too much with this cause its not too specific, but I hope I can help you a little bit with this answer or you could explain more.|`|TyTFTIJOaa	This is going to seem silly, but do what little kids do: invent a story in your mind, or think about something good in life and then let your imagination manipulate it. I sometimes might picture myself flying ( I don't havea fear of sleeping, but my body never lets me sleep til like 10 at latest lol) and eventually, (you won't even realize it) you're asleep. Watch tv til you fall asleep. Think about the dreams you might have when you sleep. OH this worked for me once reeaaaallly fast drink one and a half redbulls hits you soooo hard I almost couldn't stay awake.|`|P8xN2IzIaa	I used to have insomnia.  Once I ate healthier and began a regular sleeping routine, it helped a lot.  maybe next semester take half those classes and get a part time job to relax a bit more.

P8xN2IzIaa	like they say, there is someone for everyone.  Honestly, I would be with someone if I loved them and found out they had herpes.  I'd just make sure that they were protected.  Don't give up hope!  There are much worse things.  Just take care of your body, and don't let it spread.  Eat well, and try to stay as healthy as possible.  There was this lady in the hospital who had herpes in just about everywhere, her mouth, face, genitals, etc.  That is someone who doesn't take care of themself.  Be thankful you don't have AIDS.  That is even worse.  Take care of yourself always.|`|ngDjTbTnaa	Herpes dating sites???? I'm glad you can't see me lmao right now. Do what other millions of people doing.

There's tons of hope for the future, don't worry, but don't make the mistake of not telling people that you have herpies that WILL piss them off lol... Just wait, cuz there's always a few people who will like you and can't stay away from you, and will have to deal with condoms or something so that they don't contract it, but they will cuz they're meant for you.

pvJH5HQ5aa	I Personally, Dont think you are gay.<br>  I think you are confused about your sexuality.<br>  I think that you almost feel a presure to be gay, so your sisters will be able to talk and laugh with you, about men.<br>  I also think that when your dad made the gay remark, that stuck with you, becasue i think now you feel like "oh hes always right about everything, hes prob right about this" or "hey dad knows best".<br>  I dont think you are gay because you stated you never felt sexual feelings for a man, but have for a woman. <br>  I also think you are trying to convince yourself you are gay.<br>  <br>  I dont know if im right or not, thats just kinda what i thought from the details you gave.<br>  <br>  Gay or Not, Doesnt matter, Your still You! Remember That!|`|TyTFTIJOaa	Ok number one, trust me, if you don't want to be gay, you're not gay. You're paranoid, sadly your father did that. But hopefully this will pass, and laugh about it. That will make it seem less of a deal and you'll think about it less and then it will just fall away. And (if you're extremely worried) look up porn. You don't have OCD or if you do it's not that bad like a year ago I thought I might be bi or lesbian but there's no way.... I did what you did put the thought in my head, and every once in a while I wouldn't disagree with it, that doesn't mean I lean that way. I have a boyfriend now, and that reassured me. My close friend, he grew up around his mom and older sister. He's not gay, but he's more mature because of it. I think what might happen with you is you heard how a girl might think cuz of how you grew up, and you're a guy whose had sexual relations, so you can compare the two and get more of what's going on on both sides. That might be what you're confusing with gay.<br>  <br>  Get in another relationship with a girl, and forget about your psychiatrist (if I'm ever one I don't want to be like the ones I hear about) <br>  <br>  and<br>  Good Luck!|`|9aSmQpZ3aa	Don't worry about it. You've been raised in a macho environment, and that's why you fear being homosexual. You're not, I know the feeling that when people say something about you, you start to become that way. But believe me--its not true and it will go over. Don't be ashamed of what or who you are. If you don't want to be, go get a girlfriend! Or start doing more with boys, and do "guy activities"|`|uE2k2wa6aa	Praying is a awsome thing to do. Your dad has pre cursed you with this problem rather he ment to or not. But The thoughts are compulsive but I dont believe that its actual OCD. But I wouldnt suggest that you ask here rather than a real doctor because really most people on here are just giving advice and not a specialist. I think that after some cognitive therapy you could be fine. It has been pre conditioned in you to get anxious and think those thoughts. You are now going with the whole gay thought because its easier to accept it because it was so hard worring about trying so hard to avoid the homosexual thoughts. I will pray for you, but take my advice and see someone who specializes in cognitive therapy, it helps with compulsive thoughts or actions and I really think it would help. I DO NOT think that you are gay. Its just easier to let it take over rather than have that anxiety. Please know that. I hope this helps a little and God Bless, Holly B
WKtakdsOaa	You can do everything if you are organised. I have a 1 year old daughter, work 14 hours and am in the 3rd year of degree.

However,our acquaintance with these feelings is not limited solely to the press; in daily life,we,too,frequently come across such problems and, more importantly, personally experience them. <br>  People and societies endeavour to liberate themselves from the distressing experiences,disorder and repressive social structures that have prevailed over the world for long periods. <br>  We only need to glance at ancient Greece; the Great Roman Empire; Tsarist Russia, or the so-called Age of Enlightenment, and even the 20th century-a century of misery which saw two world wars and world-wide social disasters. No matter upon which century or location you concentrate your research, the picture will not be appreciably different. <br>  If this is the case, why haven't people succeeded in solving these problems, or at least some efforts been made to remove such social diseases from society?<br>  People have encountered these problems in all ages, yet each time they have failed to find any solutions because the methods they employed were inappropriate. They sought various solutions, tried different political systems, laid down impracticable and totalitarian rules, stirred up revolutions or subscribed to perverted ideologies, while many others preferred to adopt an indifferent attitude and merely accepted the status quo. <br>  In our day, people are almost numbed by this way of living. They readily believe these problems to be "facts of life." They picture a society immune to these problems as being nothing short of impossible-a dream utopia. They persistently and openly express their distaste for such a way of living, yet easily embrace it, since they think they have no other alternative. <br>  The resolution of all these problematic issues is possible only by living by the principles of the "true religion." Only when the values of true religion prevail can a pleasant and tranquil scene replace this gloomy and unfavourable picture, which is doomed to continue so long as God's limits are ignored. To put it another way, people are enslaved by these complications as long as they avoid the values of the Qur'an. Put simply, this is the "nightmare of disbelief" and the link below for this wonderful book:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://fs.harunyahya.net/popup/Download.php?WorkNumber=256&Format=pdf" rel="nofollow">http://fs.harunyahya.net/popup/Download....</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  you will find how the regulation of life by the "norms of morality" introduced by the Qur'an revealed to mankind by God will banish the "nightmare of disbelief," how pessimism, corruption and social restlessness can be eliminated from society, how the individual can surround himself with an ideal environment, what spiritual and material benefits he is likely to attain by adherence to these norms of morality are gone into in detail, and finally, that the unique alternative to all these problems is the morality of the Qur'an. <br>  So far, many books have attempted to deal with the social and psychological problems societies face. Yet, what distinguishes this book from others is its stress on the most realistic solution. It also sincerely warns people against the troublesome future they are likely to face if they fail to resort to this solution. <br>  We expect that every reader of conscience will grasp that peace, mutual trust and an ideal social life is attainable only by embracing the values of the Qur'an and will turn to the true religion, which is Islam. <br>  They will then happily join the ranks of those who never suffer, mentally or physically, from any of the above-mentioned complications. Around them, there will always be an abundance of favours, comfort, love, respect, peace and confidence, and moral virtues will prevail. They will know how to earn God's approval, by observing His limits and the commandments of the Qur'an. They will thus, by having faith in God, attain His mercy and at last enter Paradise. <br>  <br>  Useful link:<br>  (A BRIEF ILLUSTRATED GUIDE TO UNDERSTANDING ISLAM)<br>  <a href="http://www.islam-guide.com/islam-guide.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.islam-guide.com/islam-guide.p...</a><br>  <br>  DEEP THINKING (VIDEO):<br>  <a href="http://api.fmanager.net/api_v1/productDetail.php?dev-t=EDCRFV&objectId=1124" rel="nofollow">http://api.fmanager.net/api_v1/productDe...</a><br>   <br>  <br>  =* FOR ANY HELP FEEL FREE TO E-MAIL ME ON *=<br>  smiling4ever222@hotmail.com|`|JOXQrsw0aa	Graduate admissions are not based on a simple numeric formula like undergrad admissions at certain universities. Even a statement that a 3.0 GPA is "usually" required as at Berkeley in the Graduate division is open to several interpretations. For instance, here is the definition of a 3.0 GPA in the Graduate School of Education as explained in the FAQ # 23, 24 25:<br>  <br>  23. Which undergraduate GPA calculations does the GSE require?<br>  The only undergraduate GPA we require is the GPA for all course work after the first two years. We have an online GPA calculator available to assist you with this calculation.<br>  <br>  24. What is the minimum GPA required for admission?<br>  Applicants are expected to have achieved at least a 3.0 grade-point average in all courses taken after the first two years as undergraduates, and in all graduate-level courses.<br>  <br>  25. What is the average GPA of admitted applicants?<br>  For Fall 2008, the average undergraduate GPA of admitted applicants was 3.52. The average GPA varies by program within the Graduate School of Education.<br>  <a href="http://www-gse.berkeley.edu/admin/sas/admfaq.html" rel="nofollow">http://www-gse.berkeley.edu/admin/sas/ad...</a><br>  <br>  Beyond that, Professor Norgaard, renowned in his field, told the class that he  graduated from Berkeley with a GPA just barely over 2.0. He then worked a couple of years and decided he wanted to go to grad school. I think he said he went to either U of Oregon or Oregon State in a Masters program and did really well. From there he came back to Berkeley and earned his Ph.D. and was hired as a Professor.<br>  <a href="http://bie.berkeley.edu/node/1112" rel="nofollow">http://bie.berkeley.edu/node/1112</a><br>  <br>  Admissions departments are not usually where the decision for graduate admissions rests. That is usually with the Department itself. In your case the Philosophy Department. Letters of Recommendation are very important. More important than GPA or GRE scores. Letters of recommendation from Professors who have ties to the Philosophy department at the university an applicant wishes to matriculate hold a lot of weight. It is sort of an old boy's network. A Professor looks out for his colleagues proteges who are applying to his department and he expects his counterparts to look out for his proteges  when applying to their department. Professors from similar institutions tend to frequent the same circles. They go to the same conferences every year. They use each others books. They look out for each others proteges. They hire the graduates of each others departments.<br>   I would suggest concentrating on letters of recommendation from any Professors that you know well and who know your work and who have connections to any university Philosophy Department that you wish to apply to. If you do not have those connections, find the professors who have such connections and take a class from them and get to know them so that you can ask for a recommendation. The fact that you did poorly in unrelated courses before you were a Philosophy major is not going to be an issue of major concern when evaluating how you will perform in a graduate Philosophy degree. This should not prevent you from graduate study in Philosophy. <br>  <br>  Here is what is on the Philosophy Department's web Page at Berkeley regarding Graduate Admissions.  It does not mention anything about GPA. It does mention that they pay particularly close attention to letters of recommendation and a sample of the applicant's work.......<br>  <br>  In reviewing applications, the Admissions and Fellowships Committee looks for evidence that applicants have the training and intellectual characteristics they will need for success in a rigorous graduate program such as ours. Candidates for admission are not required to have majored in philosophy, but applicants who have not taken a considerable number of courses in the subject are unlikely to be admitted. The intellectual characteristics that the Committee looks for include the ability to write clear and well organized argumentative prose, the ability to discriminate between promising and unpromising lines of inquiry, the capacity to develop independent arguments and insights, and a nuanced appreciation of philosophical problems and issues.<br>  <br>  The Admissions and Fellowships Committee attempts in each case to arrive at a fair assessment of the candidate on the basis of the totality of evidence submitted for review. It pays particularly close attention to the candidate's sample of written work, as well as to the letters of recommendation that are sent in support of the candidate's application. Candidates should seek letters of recommendation from teachers who are in a position to comment in detail both on their general scholarly abilities and on their distinctively philosophical talents and achievements. These same qualities should be evident in the writing sample submitted for review; it should go beyond mere exposition or superficial analysis of a philosophical text or problem. A good target length for a writing sample is 15-20 (double-spaced) pages.<br>  <a href="http://philosophy.berkeley.edu/graduate/admissions" rel="nofollow">http://philosophy.berkeley.edu/graduate/...</a><br>  Good Luck!|`|lTUXdbCTaa	You can do anything you put your mind to.

As for me, I don't know, so I just try to do this life as best as possible, and see what happens afterward!|`|0YQRbq9faa	That is a very Buddhist point of view.<br>  <br>  I think most people fear death because they don't know what is going to happen to them when their soul leaves this life.<br>  <br>  I am a Bible-belieiving Christian.  I know that when my life is over, I will go to be in God's presence in Heaven.  No doubts whatsoever!<br>  <br>  So the answer to fear of death is to know for sure that Heaven is your home when you die.  The Bible is very clear about that. Read Romans 3:23; Romans 6:23,     2 Corinthians 5:21, I John 2:1-2, Revelation 3:10, and John 5:24, to find out how to know for sure that Heaven is your destiny after you leave this life.|`|AA12347234	Generally people that view death as a bad thing are those that believe in heaven and hell. Whether they admit it or not. And if death scares you, then most likely you are not right with God and know that if you die you will go to hell.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, if death doesn't scare you then either don't believe in God or else you are right with God and you know that if you die you will go to heaven.|`|G8Oeszvwaa	I don't fear death.<br>  The more and more I think about it the more I think it would be a much better idea to be dead.|`|99hfFssXaa	we didn't exist before we were concieved.  What are you talking about?|`|Q8fcepcZaa	because life is generally more fun than eternal nothingness, or depending on beliefs, the possibility of never-ending agony in a lake of fire.
58RqRuykaa	Mainly because death=end of life. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  That can be scary. As of before they were born...well,you can't miss something you never had. Now they are fully aware that they will one day have to die,which frightens a lot of people. <br>  <br>  <br>  Me? I accept it. Doesn't mean I don't find it a little unsettling,but what else can you do? Death doesn't necessarily have to be a bad thing,I believe its a peace.|`|zndg56eVaa	I don't know. Maybe its because of their religion? I'm not that afraid of death, because i know i am a good person at heart and if my religion (Buddhist) says that only bad people go to, you know the under then i don't have to be afraid, though i am very self conscious what i do and how i act, i would advise you to do the same =)|`|58YiE4pFaa	because many people have had good experiences and memories in their lifetime so they dont want those good experiences to disappear, they dont want to forget the good memories. and yea, many people do also associate death with pain, because everyone hears about how people die, and from the way people hear it, it sounds pretty gruesome.|`|Nuuk1Nwtaa	A lot of people fear the moment before death, because they anticipate pain or agony. I guess a lot of people are afraid of death itself, but I don't know why, really.|`|N45bUunaaa	You answered your own question. It is fear of nothing, not of a 'cool and peaceful' place. If when you die you go to 'nothing', it makes life here way more important and meaningful and hard to let go of. After a few million years of evolution, I find that I am genetically hardwired to survive and not to give up without a meaningful attempt at life. Death is something to be accepted but not welcomed by any means.|`|dRj9FoHzaa	Not true.  Many people see death as good thing that's why you choose suicide.   Death is not a vacation spot.  You cannot come back if you do not like it there.  People are afraid of unknown not death itself.|`|98GbovYTaa	because they're selfish..all they're crying for is THEMSELVES..because THEY'LL never see that person again..how selfish is that

nQOaKiueaa	Maybe you should simply stay away from arguments...<br>  It's hard to do that but the farther away you are from arguing or being angry then the better...<br>  If you can't avoid getting into an argument, then, you should try to stay focus and always tell yourself that it's only an argument, and that you shouldn't stay pissed over something, I may say, worthless.<br>  If you stay pissed over it for days you are not hurting anybody but yourself.. so you shouldn't do such a thing...it's not like the person you argued with cares whether or not you are okay, you know?<br>  <br>  Hope this helps... :)|`|qtVCb9EKaa	clench your teeth like a cartoon character until you break them xD|`|m125JazMaa	Maybe you need to reflect on the relevance of the situation? If you look back to any arguments after a week or so they always fade away and are petty half the time.<br>  Also learn to chill if someone is arguing, you have to learn to be the opposite of what they are being to you that works well, also misdirection works well if you ask them a question about how they are or something they are doing it breaks the argument side of it.|`|tknP0oWPaa	Well this could be occuring because you perform too less activities so there are too few thoughts on your mind I would reccomend you to play sports join sport clubs socialise as long as you are joining the correct people and watch comedy movies also keep in mind that whatever happens will not be the end of the world if possible watch comedy films they make you happier|`|fUvyB0Unaa	i have that same problem. that is why lately i have been trying my best to avoid arguements, esp when i know it'll create when someone automatically says something i disagree with. its best to either walk away or to just smile and tell your self that is not worth getting mad over. but we are all learning arent we =)

7jOuJLxYaa	sounds you are not living in a real world or being at the present moment. u know when you live healthy, you should be all at the place and the time you are now and shouldn't be any where else. I mean your minds, don't think of future or even past. that is why most people don't enjoy their present time and wandering in the past or future and lose their chance of living in the moment. past is past and future might never come. good luck.|`|S8KwcHe0aa	wow thats awesome is there some weird food i can eat to do that/ haha|`|cTvP6j7Haa	It happens to every one in this world.  It happens to teenager females. most often.  Thereafter teens in general and as you get older you have to make an effort to experience it again.  Part of growing up.  Called daydreaming and unconscious meditation.  Your guardian angel must call you back to ensure you don't hurt yourself.<br>  Peace.|`|1y8Qrx0zaa	This happens to me a lot too. Usually it's because your in your own thoughts, and hearing someone else pulls you back to your surroundings. Just make sure your welcoming when opportunities to tune back into life present themselves.
AA11305474	So far the auto bailouts have not worked and the one for the financial institutions has only had unintended consequences.  I am of the opinion that we cannot spend our way out of this recession.  The party is over and the reality is that we have been largely living on credit and it is time to live within our means.  And you are right, in this economy that is hard to do because wages have been stagnant for years while the price of nearly everything from health care, to electricity, to water, to food, to trash collection, to just live keeps increasing.  I hope something works and we don't have riots in our streets, however.|`|wqchA8B7aa	You don't understand how it works.  If people can't afford to buy things, then merchants will lower the price. To be able to do this, they will demand a lower price from the producers. This is called deflation, and we haven't gotten there yet, but people won't just stop buying things.|`|StqBr5XRaa	no there won't be riots but crime will go up and desperation will start to kick in on some people  so just be prepared people and      god bless us all
nQOaKiueaa	I don't think it's genetic.<br>  Personality is a bit more complicated, some says it is genetic and some says it's not.<br>  I personally think that it's not. Your personality is based on your surroundings and your upbringing.<br>  And whoever you are is whoever you are, no genes can replace that! <br>  <br>  Hope this helps... :)|`|LJkPRqN0aa	phhht no. thats an emotion and emotions are not genetic.....<br>  <br>  ps im short and i dont envy anyone that is tall.....|`|DsEEATKSaa	No.<br>  <br>  ~Dr. B.~|`|0YQRbq9faa	No.  It is our natural selfish reaction to the events that come our way in life.<br>  <br>  As a Christian, the Bible tells me not be envious or jealous.  God would not tell me to refrain from jealously and envy if it were a genetic condition that I could not control.<br>  <br>  You know, jealously and envy are really hatred. You hate the other person for some perceived advantage or blessing that they have received when you feel you deserved it.  <br>  <br>  Hatred will ruin your life.  Don't go there.  It is natural to have feelings of jealously from time to time, but don't dwell on it.  You will have your turn at good things and blessings in life.  <br>  <br>  Don't build hatred in your life.  It will affect all your relationships and leave you alone and lonely because no one wants to be around a hateful person for any length of time.|`|NqYeR2g5aa	No. Jealousy is something you feel, not something you inherit. Whether your jealous or not is a learned emotion and it depends on the experiences you go through in life.|`|1147fde3deacb66e77c8c89ab71de202aa	even if it was people can always learn new behavioral patterns.|`|pBglddrmaa	What is and isn't genetic is kind of hard to determine.<br>  <br>  But we do have to remember, that our genes determine the way our brains are shaped and their chemical make-up, which will thereby determine to some extent, how you react to things and situations.<br>  <br>  I don't think it's very difficult to spot traits you have that are similar if not the same as your parents.<br>  <br>  Perhaps jealousy is just a quick reaction that's part of your makeup. Doesn't mean you can't control it though. <br>  <br>  Sometimes I get jealous when...I really don't want to, or I know it's stupid...it wasn't until you asked this question that I realised that my father, especially is a very jealous person, and to a lesser extent, my mother is too.<br>  <br>  Maybe some part of it is LoL<br>  <br>  I think people have the wrong idea about genetics. Just because something is genetic, doesn't mean you don't have control over it. So what if someone is naturally jealous? That doesn't give them an excuse to be jealous all the time or something. <br>  <br>  A person is made by the choices they make in the situations they're presented with, not their genes. <br>  <br>  Being presented with "bad genes" is just another situation you either overcome, or you don't.

More and more peoples will out of work not only in the US, Hong Kong, but globally. We all know that America is known as the economic locomotive. If America economically goes bad, many countries will follow. Why the staggering inflation of every thing can buy or sell? It is simply because the bull market. Since those greedy investors in stock shares, buying homes, funds and bonds, and all wanted vast rewards. For instance, during the bull market in 2008, many banks, including ads in Yahoo and free community newspapers regarding the stable huge rewards for investing in the Food and Commodity funds. The truth is that it had driven the food and gas prices up dramatically at the same time. Many consumers were outcry foul for the inflation made their life harder in Hong Kong and the US. In Hong Kong the stock market only created fewer millionaires but the majority ordinary citizens suffered by losing their jobs. Many family tragedies of divorces, killing his or her spouses, and many had committed suicides in Hong Kong during the bull market period of fewer happiness but more sad stories.<br>  I think Obama should pass his veto to withdraw the US troops from Iraq at ealier than its assumed schedule. This can save ten billion US dollars per day and definitely can relief the slow down US economy. He should make a subtle plan with his financial think tank to destroy the global stock market gradually but wisely. It will be a good sign for the Dow Jones Index decline to 4,000 points and Hong Kong Heng Seng Index fell to 8,000 points in the near future. He should smart and powerful enough to maintain the small daily and annual flutuations, say not +/- 10% daily and annually. If he can manage to do this, the inflations will be controlled well globally. The relationships getting worsen for couples or lovers are caused by the human weakness of greed, selfishness, and fear of loss belongings.

This happened one day, when i was working this woman started behaving strangely. o where we go as a team she started following me. then one day when i could not accompany my team to a eatery where she too went,  the next day she blasted me for no reason. another day, shameless to say she started pulling her saree well down and stared showing her navel. I was like, why is this woman like this.<br>  <br>  Her character is that she needs attention from her male employees and nobody should object to her attitude. Adding to this another two lady project leaders they get together plan things and always create trouble in the project we use work. <br>  <br>  Let me know how to tackle this menace, or is there any mens' sangh or forum or cell, where i can put my thoughts so that i dont get into trouble in my future because of this woman.

nQOaKiueaa	There's no such thing as you can't feel anything.<br>  Of course you have feelings and you feel stuff it's just that there is no one whom you can share these feelings and emotions with.<br>  And so you think you have no feelings for love, affection, or joy.<br>  People might be avoiding you because that's what they can see from the outside, and again, their loss since they don't want to get to know you. But so what? I mean, so what if that's what they think about you, it's not true anyway, so don't let yourself believe it! <br>  <br>  Hope this helps... :)<br>  <br>  And nobody knows anytihng about the future, especially their own.<br>  Just chill!|`|7cUDstdjaa	Take a step back - learn to like yourself again.

To me I thought it was the next week not 300 years later. There was a woman who explained that I had different DNA, and that's why I was the only one to be accurately cloned. And there was some agency trying to get my DNA so they could research it themselves, because there was something "special" about it, so they kept trying to kill me through sniper attacks and running me off the road... it was so weird, I didn't wake up till me and my were in another car race, when my friend jordy turned to me and told me to wake up... seriously weird, i've never had a dream tell me to wake up.<br>  I've been looking over my shoulder all day thinking someone was gonna run us off the road.|`|ptWHIVjZaa	I have vivid dreams fairly often, and it will generally effect how I feel for the rest of the day.<br>  <br>  The only vivid dreams that I've truly disliked are those in which I wake up, go to school, go home, do all my homework, stay up late finishing an essay, and go to sleep again . . . and then I wake up for real and have to do the whole thing over again!!!

xJqSrunEaa	I believe in assisted suicide in some cases. If it were ever to be legalized, it would need to have some heavy laws around it. But I have gone through two family members having terminal illnesses. One tried to kill themselves by overdosing. We were told that we would be blamed for assisted suicide if he was found dead at our home, whether or not we actually had something to do with it. And by the last few weeks, the doctors just drug them up so much that they're really not 'there' anyway. It's quite painful when they want to go in a dignified manner, where they can choose, but are told that they have to suffer through an untreatable pain until it kills them. I don't think though, that just anybody can go in and ask for help to be killed. And the whole 'doctors becoming corrupt because of it' deal. But in some cases... it's kinder to people. Just my two cents.|`|1y8Qrx0zaa	Though suicide is an answer, I take a firm stand that it is NOT the right one. And you won't be around to see that.<br>  <br>  Does it matter who helps? How is it better if it's sanitary or quick?<br>  <br>  If there is no way to save them, obviously you can't do anything.  But it should be either theirs or their families decision. However if it were <br>  me, I would want to suffer through it.  For personal reasons.<br>  <br>   They are trying to appease the needs of the injured or impaired, not their own.|`|aqeWwA71aa	Poor old Dr. Kevorkian is sort of like Jesus - he sacrificed his life for us idiots.  <br>  <br>  I assisted at a suicide once.  It was a real privilege to be that trusted - but for most of us there won't be any help when our time comes, and we'll die alone and in pain. The christians get all hysterical over suicide, assisted or not - and like it or not, they make the rules.|`|ZkrGttKaaa	The doctor had some strong arguments. But you might be surprised at how many people have family doctors they have similar unspoken agreements with. You know, that say, "here are some pills to help your back pain. Should you ever really need them. But be real careful... ten of these would stop a persons heart." (nudge, nudge, wink, wink...)|`|AA11579568	I'm all for assisted suicide. Each person has a right to decide if and when to end his or her own life, it's no one else's decision. Any one that is willing to help is a hero in my book, a doctor or anyone else. Why should a person be forced to live a life he or she doesn't want?|`|AA11324847	I wish someone would assist me with one....
EMmGFqgJaa	The detectives who investigate the case are usually good enough to figure out if a case of domestic violence is real or not.

That seeing something on the screen desensitizes you to it in real life.  If you see so much carnage on screen that you will be less affected by real violence.  I think that is probably so to some degree.  I am not sure that it translates to you actually becoming violent yourself.  It could in some people perhaps but that person may well have been likely to be that way from something that happened in their lives.  Folks don't live in a bubble so it is difficult to know for certain that something causes a behavior.|`|yMhJhPqjaa	Yes
2GNFQPdmaa	To give the simplest answer. in a command economy, decisions are centralized. Some authority decides what will be produced and consumed. This is predictable and orderly but creates much inefficiency. in a free market economy, consumers and producers each decide what they personally will produce or consume. This is efficient but very chaotic, and prone to booms and busts. A mixed economy is exactly what it sounds like: it is usually fundamentally free market in nature but there is a command structure that makes some decisions. A common kind of mixed economy is sometimes called a "planned" economy, because consumers and producers make almost all of the short-term decisions, but a planner makes almost all of the long-term decisions.|`|f6KTUW1maa	Mainly...<br>  A free-market system is where an 'invisble-hand' regulates the economy. There's little government intervention and the theory is that the invisible-hand sets fair prices on the laws of demand and supply.<br>  <br>  A command economy is where everything is planned by some central planners (or the government). Prices are set. Consumption and production is controlled by the command economy.<br>  <br>  A mixed economy is the United States. We have a free market system where prices/consumption/production are driven freely, but the government also intervenes to ensure safety - like child labor laws, safe factory equipment things like that.

But deep down in your soul, you know He does.  You are just exasperated because you have been seeking Him in the wrong way, and did not find Him; therefore, you are exasperated and conclude there is no God. This is not true.<br>  <br>  You feel empty because God is not a part of your life. He is what gives meaning to life.  I am not talking about religion. Religion is performance based and gets you no where with God according to the Bible.  So you are right, religion and rituals do nothing for you.<br>  <br>  Christianity is an intimate, personal, loving, real relationship with God.  It is not performance based. It is not based on religion.  It is not based on any specific church or denomination or creed.  It is not based on anything other than God's love for you and His desire to have a personal relationship with you.<br>  <br>  You enter than personal relationship with God by realizing that you are a sinner that has disobeyed and rebelled against God. I think you already understand this.  Then, we sincerely and genuinely pray to God without pretense, and ask Him to save our souls, give us eternal life, and forgive all of our sins.  It is that simple.  It is a free gift that God gives to anyone who puts their faith and trust in Jesus Christ's payment for our sins by His death on the cross.  <br>  <br>  We must personally invite Jesus into our heart and life to forgive our sins, to give us eternal life, and fill our life with the purpose and plans that God has for our life.  That is what give meaning to life.  Nothing else will.<br>  <br>  Get a hold of a Bible and read the following verses.  Meditate on them and you will see what I am talking about. Romans 3:23; Romans 6:23, John 3:16, 2 Corinthians 5:21, I John 2:1-2, Revelation 3:10, and John 5:24.  <br>  <br>  You have tried everything else, why not give this a try.  You will not be disappointed in God when you seek Him in the Bible.<br>  <br>  Jeremiah 29:13 says "And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart."

4BBjhHAnaa	I would probably say the Bible.<br>  <br>  A lot of people had very strong ideas about it, the message it sends, and what it stands for.<br>  These ideas cause a lot of hate, and consequently a lot of violence, death, and oppression.  It is the root of things like the Inquisition, the Crusades, terrorist groups/acts like the IRA, and many other wars and conflicts.<br>  <br>  On the flip side, it has done a lot of good. It gives people hope and brings people together, and also gives us a foundation for moral guidelines.  I don't know if it is enough to out weigh the bad-- it might be, I really can't say.  But I bet  that the second part of your question is what book has done the most good, and I would say the Bible for that, as well.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  On a lighter note, Great Expectations has caused a lot of high schoolers (myself and my roommate included) a lot of grief.  Dickens should never have been published.|`|ZsxbOXtzaa	the bible|`|D4ot0qLpaa	Considering the Crusades and their modern counterparts, I would have to agree that so far, it's the Bible. However, in all fairness, it must be said that it's not the book itself, but how people interpret it and use it, which causes the damage. <br>  <br>  For every group out there that is reading the Bible and seeing it as a source of justification for hate crimes, there's another group reading it as a source of inspiration for greater social justice. The Bible has been used both to justify slavery and to counter racism. It has done both great evil and great good - because the people reading it have used it that way.<br>  <br>  The particular danger of a book like the Bible lies in the fact that it is the official text of a mainstream religion (or set of religions), which makes people very comfortable with it, and yet it contains many parts which can easily be seen by extremists as supportive of rigorously intolerant and violent viewpoints and actions. <br>  <br>  Many, many people have grown up being taught that Biblical interpretation is an exact science, that it is possible to "prove" what any given line from the Bible "really" means. This leaves them susceptible to any charismatic person who claims to have a better interpretation and can back it up with arguments that sound "historical" or "scientific" - because in reality, it is easy to find many, many alternate readings of Biblical "truth". <br>  <br>  Because of its unique position in American religious sensibility especially, the Bible can be used to play on people's fears, and it becomes fuel for the fires of ambitious leaders who want to draw lines of war between one segment of society and another. (Remember that famous moment seven years ago when, two days after 9/11, an extremely popular television religious figure told the world exactly who was to blame for all this death and destruction - not the terrorists who actually did the deed, but gays, pagans, unwed mothers, and the ACLU?)<br>  <br>  Obviously, the Bible is not the only book that can be used this way. The Qur'an is clearly also subject to multiple interpretations, including both peaceful and violent ones, and certainly its most violent interpreters have done their share of damage in recent years. It is entirely possible that some other religious book will eventually outrun the Bible in this category. (And personally I suspect that only a religious book could ever have enough influence to do this amount of damage.) But at this moment in history, any contender still has a long way to go!|`|kAceP1pzaa	Mien Kamf<br>  Kuran<br>  Harry potter
WoA4MDj1aa	Your English is pretty good; you got your point across.  On your first point sometimes it is good to have some differences between a "public" and "private" self.  You should be more security conscious and not give a whole lot away in public or with others you do not know as well as your immediate circle.  Point #2 is a problem I have, too.  You can't think of the best lines or actions to use in a situation.  Do you know the old line, "If I had it to do over again I wouldn't change a thing."  It is total bull....; I always end up reviewing my conversations or actions with regrets and wish I could have changed some things here and there.  But don't dwell on these things; fix what you can and move on.  There is so much more to do.|`|lTUXdbCTaa	I totally know what you're going through.

You can do it :)|`|v4eBm6cMaa	Sounds like you might feel shy, or have a little social anxiety. A lot of people do, its totally natural. Your mind tries to keep you from saying the wrong thing, but you just have to learn to trust that people arnt waiting to laugh at you- that they actually want to be your friend and listen to what you have to say! The truth is, if their worth having as a friend, they aren't judging you. <br>  <br>  To come out of your shell, you might try taking an acting class- (they are offered at community colleges among other places). You can also just make an effort to smile and say hi to strangers, or ask them what time it is. Think of talking to people outside your circle of friends and family like you would any other skill, the more practice you get the better you will be. But as for the deeper side of it, youll feel so much better when you realize that there is nothing wrong with you, so you dont need to edit yourself... sometimes we close up so that nothing bad will happen, but the funny thing is that by closing up we missed out on life- so something bad did happen! I used to be soooo shy, but now there are only a few things that make me want to clam up... I took acting classes and speech classes in college, and they really helped me feel less shy. it just takes practice and self acceptance. Best of luck!

When you start to get older and date older men, you will see that men are not nearly as shallow as when they are young.  You keep taking care of yourself.  Remember that we all have our crosses to bear in this life.  This is just yours.  Just think....there are WAY worse problems that you could have.  I know it doesn't seem like it now.  You are just at an age where people are cruel, and if you aren't perfect (what Cosmo considers perfect) you just don't always fit in.  Things will improve and you will find your "group" to fit in with in college.  Keep your grades up and don't worry about that stuff that seems so important now...because very soon you will have a whole new set of priorities as you enter adulthood.  My one regret from high school was letting others hurt me the way they did.  It really messed me up in the head and took a lifetime of pain to get over.

Treat yourself like you would a really good friend. Don't be so concerned with fitting in, thinking with the crowd usually is the surest way to let yourself down, you've got feelings of your own and ideas of your own irrespective of what other people might have laid out for you, some even before you were born, take a little time to just be ALONE its not as bad as it sounds, don't beat up on yourself for a minute and you just might learn to accept yourself for the truly wonderful individual that you are and understand that you will effect this world one way or another without ever having to fit it or living someone elses lie. Take some time to just think about what your real needs are, and what your real wants are, notwithstanding what people might be pushing at you and telling you is best for you. You'll get by. it might seem difficult at first but thats a good sign youre going in the right direction. Just keep your mind open and be good to yourself. Good luck. Chin up.

Pigs like bankers who make $450,000 a year in salaries and they take 31 million dollars a years in bonus money.  That would not be the only big bonus HOG in the company, there are several HOGS at the bank trough.  These same HOGS want the line workers in Detroit to take pay cuts and congress agrees. This while the CEO'S of the auto manufacturer's take NO salary.   People used to invest in the stock market for retirement, that money was supposed to grow & multiply so you could have a lot of money in the bank to retire.  RARELY does a company pay a DIVIDEND any more which is what is supposed to make your money GROW, because stocks do not pay interest.  Today they DO NOT pay diddly for dividends, but they should be paying, and paying with  those several bonus's paid to the executives  worth about 31 million apiece.  Just one more way to cheat Americans.  How can they justify those bonus's when the stock for those companies is trading at less than $1 a share.  Because now all one could hope to rely on with the stock market for retirement is to hope the price of the stock goes up and you can sell it.  Not happening today.  So that kind of greed and cheating in the monumental proportions of the HOGS in the financial<br>   world and the Bush administration.<br>  <br>  When too much greed & theft puts all the money in one place there in none to circulate and we have recession.

No it would be nothing, or very little, to do with the outward attractiveness of the man, physically, or how he dressed or acted. Rather it would be after some careful observation over a period of time, a gut feeling and a woman's intuition. In addition I'd say that for me at least, one element of non-attraction would be the way he reacted with and to me in situations where there were several other people.

Simply because I don't date people that don't make a valid attempt to know me first, and be friends before it turns into dating.  So if I am friends with someone that I don't find attractive, and they want to date, then I tell them we should be friends.  Except I actually mean it.

Style, intelligence, personality, humor, etc.<br>  <br>  If I was single I might tell someone I'm not interested even though I'm attracted because I just don't think it would work out.<br>  <br>  If a guy was physically attractive I might be "interested" but may not pursue anything farther than checking him out.<br>  <br>  I could be not interested even if he was attractive and a great communicator because our belief systems could be totally off or he could be really dumb.

AA10662074	the answer is A. <br>  <br>  an increase in the number of people seeking credit raises demand, and in turn, raise interest rates. <br>  <br>  an increase in the opportunity cost of lending pushes more people to seek credit, which is exactly as the 2nd choice. <br>  <br>  a decrease in the number of lenders reduces supply, which increases interest rates. <br>  <br>  ALLOWING foreign banks to compete increase supply, driving down interest rates. the answer is the 1st one, A.|`|p1ySkjSNaa	A, the increase in foreign banks offers more lenders, which increases the supply which decreases the interest rates.
WPh4aAbeaa	If you only thought that everyone didn't like you, that's low self esteem. <br>  But since you say you think your best friend is conspiring with your worst enemy, that's paranoia. <br>  <br>  However, work through it as low self-esteem. Unless you're doubting everything people say, are seeing your best friend and worst enemy talking together and automatically assume they are cinpsiring against you, AND you are able to think up an entire plot that you think/believe is what they are doing against you (based, you may tell yourself, on perfectly sound logic because you can recall the bad things or even just things that don't give you any advantage, that have been happening lately), THEN you may be a bit more paranoid than having low self esteem with an active imagination.<br>  <br>  But I don't think you need professional help yet; if you feel like you maybe should try some professional help, you can talk first with your school nurse or guidance counsellor, or a trusted teacher, or even your family doctor, for advice etc, before dishing out the big bucks for something you likely don't have. <br>  <br>  Have more faith in your ability to gather the right sort of friends, more faith in your friends, and last but definitely not least, more faith in your own abilities (minus the ability to doubt people excessively ^___^) and attractiveness as a person. ^_^|`|jeYi7APraa	YOUR PARANOID!!<br>  <br>  just try not to worry about what other people think..<br>  cause in the end you can really only trust yourself..|`|ygGr1nX7aa	Paranoia is the word you're looking for.|`|cd8ff0f053ce1a2e1b3303ea5ec2f1c7aa	definitely paranoia|`|yV8fog7Paa	low self esteem.

Life is a gift.....enjoy it and all of it's beauty !  Please.|`|VpTUFKXiaa	You dont always have to cry to ge the sadness/ anger easily and healthily. But what helps me is keeping a journal and writing down your thoughts and when you got them all down on paper that no one can see, you'll feel alot better. This also helps like if you want to tell a freind or parent something and don't know how to say it. Writing it helps you clear your thoughts. Ask your friends for help too. They always help me feel better about my problems and hang out with them a lot to help. And if worse comes to worse and your angery and dont know what to do...Do NOT cut yourself but punch a pillow, write it down, even scribble it, and call a good friend to talk it out to. Hope i helped you alot!!! Good luck! :)|`|XUnsJ2xjaa	it doesnt matter that you dont cry. everyone takes things differently.
