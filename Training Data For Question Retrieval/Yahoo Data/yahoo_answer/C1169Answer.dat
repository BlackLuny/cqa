As long as you don't wear something ugly and stupid like baggy pants/tight jeans and the actual you looks good you'll catch girls' eyes.|`|nHV3sKJ3aa	For me...<br>  I like guys that dress like rocker/skater/emo/scene<br>  Skinny jeans, v-necks, band shirts, jewelry, tattoos, piercings, hair between the shoulders and chin<br>  :D|`|elbsvhHuaa	ok i say urban with a mix of his own taste<br>  fitted jeans not too baggy not too tight<br>  with a hat and maybe a scarf depending on the guy <br>  and who doesnt wear t shirts all the time but sometimes wheres something like a button down flannel|`|NgXTmjATaa	i love like, tight T-shirts and those really nice fitting jeans, not like, baggy. and i love short hair and when guys with dark hair have fauxhawks. hope i helped!|`|40dUfARwaa	depends on what tha guy can pull off<br>  i like the tight pants/snake bites/piercings/band shirts<br>  <br>  but the guy has to look good in them|`|kem9eTU4aa	there sexy eyes and longish hair <br>  how there shirt pop out at u <br>  abs  but not really <br>  emo,skater, rocker<br>  tattoos|`|x8inbQh5aa	I like Hollister, Abercrombie, and such on a guy. with LONG hair. short hair, for me, is just sort of yuck. but usually, we dont care what you dress like as long as its clean and you smell nice :) oh, & it sort of matches.|`|3y3O3xF9aa	ha ha ha <br>  a paisa is a total turnoff, all girls have different taste personally mine are skaters <3 :)<br>  but what catches a girls attention the most are eyes, smile, and smell ;D<br>  so get a nice Cologne|`|CNfvYUzGaa	i like casual always nice dressed. and i always look first at  the hair. i love guys with cool hair style. and then the eyes smile ... things like that|`|imjBDlFnaa	i like casual/rocker/emo. but no tight pants. haha.|`|GLpVyXD6aa	it just depends on the girl if you dress a certain way a certain type of girl will like you <br>  and make sure you're wearing good shoes <br>  please take that advice|`|fllm2ObYaa	As long as you look good wearing what your wearing :D<br>  but not saggy jeans or super duper tight jeans xD but only sum guy can pull that off not every guy can|`|zwPYKJBoaa	nice hair<br>  v necks<br>  skinny jeans<br>  piercings<br>  and if he smells good|`|gMh3liieaa	well, of course it's different for every girl.<br>  it sort of depends on what girl your trying to <br>  get to see you. what's she seem into sort of thing.<br>  <br>  personally i like preppy but not like stuck up ohh i'm<br>  a rich ***** sort of thing. i like skater looks. just looking<br>  like they are clean, clean teeth,hands and all that.<br>  <br>  clean clothes, and decent hair, smelling good are always<br>  a plus too.<br>  <br>  <br>  dont change your clothing style JUST for what girls like.<br>  do it because you feel comfortable in what your wearing.<br>  just try to be clean and come off as your atleast trying.<br>  sort of like how you dont think its so attractive when girls<br>  dont try, girls sort of feel the same way.

egOOi6Imaa	First of all calm down shes ur friend stop over obsessing with that I mean sure it may be very gross but yeah.<br>  <br>  Just have more of your friends tell her that its becoming a problem and try different stuff with her hair. It might need some treatment cuz she may have very oily hair and if she does she should switch her shampoo and conditioner. Also she  may be using to  much conditioner and for her to shower everyday might be a good thing. The ultimite reason why its not good to wash your hair everyday is cuz it will dry ur hair out but that doesnt seem like a problem she has.|`|AA11000207	I think you might be being a little mean to your pal you don't know what they do to their hair they might use lots of hair products or that might be how their hair naturally is if you have bangs they get greasier (and quicker) than the rest of your hair as your constantly flicking them out of your eyes i used to do that a lot before i grew mine out|`|dLSZ5noIaa	Invite her to a slumber party and insist on taking turns doing each others hair. <br>  <br>  ******THIS IS PREFERRED TO DO WITH A WET2STRAIGHT STRAIGHT IRON, BUT A NORMAL WILL BE OK******<br>  <br>  ***Put iron heat as high as possible***<br>  <br>  When you are doing hers, straight iron her hair to death!!!

If you work too hard or are stressed out it can make ur hair greasier, especially if you play with it or people touch it. just keep these tips in mind. personal hygiene is important and i'm sure your friend will come to realize it on her own! hope this helps! :)|`|pKLdgPT6aa	well.....  just tell her that you think it is gross.  and your just telling her that as a friend. maybe she should she try some other shampoo and conditioner. but just ket her do whatever she wants to do with her hair. most of my friends hair is gross too. she cant use some type of shampoo so ther e is only i brand she can use and she dont uses it. so her hair smells like a crappy baby diaper|`|68r8R2otaa	It is disgusting when people have greasy hair, why not get her some tea trea conditioner then it also stops grease getting to your bangs|`|fXjlWQO6aa	tell her to use a dry conditioner that you can just spray in. it takes the grease out<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ar6YVZJHKHdT44qHFn8Iytjsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090307164531AA9ngO4">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|OHfcGAgIaa	SO WHAT??

Poif4h01aa	You can buy them at most high end beauty supply stores and some select Targets also sell them. They are clip on style extenstions. If you buy the style that just adds length, you clip it underneath the rest of of your real hair at the base of your head. If you have thin hair it may hurt to wear them because the fake hair is held up by being clipped to the roots of your real hair. <br>  They are cute though and probally the best self applied hair extentions! Good luck|`|tX21M00faa	It's a piece of hair stuck to the part of a wig, they have 6 clips or so and they fasten pretty easily. I like it, but it isn't real hair, it's really cool for a night out or a party!|`|RoR05Gf3aa	i got those there bs. they suck soooo bad.

And I love hello kitty also but, I feel like you can almost dupe it with Heatherette Trios. but i LOVE the pink fish lip conditioner from HK.

A daily multivitamin (nature made multi for her is a good one) will help a great deal with the unhealthy look and dark circles and help your skin renew itself.  Vitamins and minerals are vital and even a slight deficiency will show on your skin...plus they will make you feel better.  When i remember to take mine, the difference is incredible.  Secondly, i am going to pass on a miracle that my friend told me about last year and i've been doing it ever since.  Coconut oil...make sure it is organic and extra virgin (it will cost around $11 for a jar and will last practically forever...i've had mine for a year and have barely made a dent in it).  The friend that told me about it always had such bad skin and now her skin has an amazing glow and is flawless.  I can also say that my skin is tons better and is so soft now and my complexion is back.  All you have to do is wash your face and then while your face is still slightly damp put a pea size amount on just like a regular lotion. I know this is kinda a lot to read but i still have more :).  What you use to wash your face is important too...i absolutely love Jason D-clog (its organic and will cost around $10 but also last forever because you only use a small amount) it has jojoba beads that nourish and also exfoliate. i also would suggest Burt Bee's tomato complexion soap....really it will depend on your skin type but the organic or at least all natural part is very important...chemicals will ruin your skin.  I hope that this helps you and good luck!
mtI3R2FWaa	it just kinda neutralizes the tones in your face and supposedly blends it, ive tried many toners before from high end brands as well, and honestly i wasn't really impressed.<br>  just stick with a moisturizer & primer, prime your eyes, face, and lashes.. thats all you need and well of course your makeup[:|`|dPsaYMOvaa	Applying a toner daily evens out your skin tone, to give your skin a smooth, softer look.|`|ujomB7iHaa	I would like to know as well|`|NZ5pOYJFaa	I use witch hazel toner and after one day my skin was BABY SOFT!!<br>  <br>  A toner is a liquid you put on your face that cleans the extra dirt, oil, and cleanser residue.

So you can try one of those<br>  <br>  but they are "fading" cream not "removing creams" so it might slightly fade it or fade it where you can barely see it or it might not work at all.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wreckingbalm.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.wreckingbalm.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.tatbgone.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.tatbgone.com</a>|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	No, wrecking balm only works to fade a tattoo in order to make it easier to cover up with another. If it removed a tattoo completely then people wouldn't be spending thousands on laser. Don't waste your money on it, it's a waste of time.<br>  <br>  There are a few other options such as dermabrasion which aren't common these days - they leave very bad scarring from what I hear, and I've no idea what the price difference is between that and laser.<br>  <br>  Realistically, your best bet is laser - and until you can afford it it may just be a case of sucking it up and wearing long sleeves for work - sucks I know but sometimes a necessity!|`|SwtENJdOaa	Its a very painful process of tattoo and it can be VERY expensive too! Can you just wear long sleeve shirts to work everyday? (I know that would kind of suck, but as long as its covered..?)

Either wear long sleeves or get heavy duty cover up like Dermablend.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dermablend.com/index.aspx?" rel="nofollow">http://www.dermablend.com/index.aspx?</a>|`|AA10008572	Other than makeup or worst cutting the skin off (drastic); you're stuck with long sleeves.|`|zDJ26bktaa	A cheese grader works, I keep telling people this but no one listens.|`|Xu8FHAQgaa	sorry, you're the one that wanted it in the first place :/, but sometimes beauty takes pain, so go get the laser treatment done when you have the $$, even though i heard it hurts like a bi*ch. I would say just use cover up makeup for now..not much else you can do..good luck :)|`|Ht18zkd0aa	Tattoo removal has worked for so many people already, but of course it just the way applying it.

s2sTMAy6aa	1: Use an anti-poof leave in conditioner. Herbal Essence has a really good one that has a reasonable price.

YWaUaPaSaa	Whatever you do, do not shop online. Since you are a teen you are not fully developed and you need to try everything on before you buy it. I suggest Kohls, TJ Maxx, Marshall's and Ross, stores like that. They sell designer stuff at good prices. I saw a Dooney and Bourke wallet at Marshall's for $40.00! Try it.

cdcc5bd1e7cd458a1cc4a95f146da288aa	yes it is possible. Normally I wear a 38C and I was at nordstrom's last weekend, and the person helping me thought the bra looked too big around for me and had me try a 36DD.  I fit me fine.<br>  <br>  generally when you go up a band size you need to go down a cup size.  the next size down from a 40C is a 38DD.<br>  <br>  also be aware that the bra should be fairly snug when worn on the loosest hooks.  Over time the bra will stretch and you should tighten the bra accordingly.|`|J1kJb98Maa	there is a big difference between a dd and a c cup<br>  are they different brand bras?<br>  i find there is a huge differences in sizes with makers but still a dd and c that seems a little too big|`|eHn5IWkaaa	maybe that brands are different so they fit different|`|gdGDvWTDaa	not weird...it  just means one doesnt fit right|`|MG9lw2d8aa	bras have sister sizes.  The basic rule is that if you go up a band size and down a cup size, it should fit about the same.  But that means if you are a 40C, you should also fit in a 38d... i dunno about this dd business.  Or maybe if the 38dd fits better, then a 40d would be the other size that fits.  Id go to a bra shop and see an expert to find out if you are wearing the right size.|`|AA12299772	no. they are relatively the same. it's like a girl who has a size seven foot in womens, can also wear a size 4 in men. those two sizes are almost the same. the numbers are how wide you are 38-40 isn't that much diff. your probably inbetween sizes.|`|9Q3wfQpPaa	not really. the number is the length around your body and the letter is the cup size. it sounds alittle odd. but im sure one of them is either marked wrong or you just can not see that one fits better than the other. good luck.|`|3866f8902aa539f737e362949ec4f25baa	depends on the cut of the bra, some do not seem to be the same size (just like jeans), make sure you get measured to be sure but it is very possible to have different bra sizes|`|eHWE79i8aa	Dam, you gotta be fat girl to wear freaken 38 or 40 of anything.|`|1O45sCxZaa	not really. especially if both bras are different brands, because some brands differ a little in size.|`|HdxXEPcSaa	Pics would help,  its probably just different styles|`|rHKW1CJJaa	no its wrong.<br>  <br>  you can fit into a C cup if its a big bandsize but you also have big enough boobs to fit a double d in a smaller band size?<br>  <br>  i know sizes varie by brands but WTF i dont think so hunny.|`|g2R7e2eVaa	PIC's?
meWkZnYnaa	yes... you can clip your bangs back (bobby pins). next you scrunch your hair with mousse and take a little piece of hair on the side (besides your bangs) and braid it then do the same on the other side. now you take all of your hair and put it in a bun and spray it with hair spray and WALA you have a hair style that is cute but sporty casual but can still wear it to church .thats the style that i do almost every day.<br>  <br>                                     tips:<br>                                     use bobby pins that match your hair color<br>                                     it looks more preppy when its a high bun and more serious with it lower<br>                                     you can use hair gel if you have shorter hair but i use hair spray and i have my hair a little below my sholders|`|FyEYarmqaa	I'm half black and half white.

xp6UVyj2aa	There's not much you can do other than wait for it to grow back. Take good care of your hair, and use conditioner. There are hair products you can find at even wal-mart for growing long hair. You can spike it and do fun things with it while its short. On average hair grows about 6 inches a year, if you take good care of it (Good shampoo and chemicals that are good to your hair, no hair dye) up to 8 or 9. I'm in the same boat as you growing it back, don't forget regualr trims split ends stunt hair growth.

5Wd6sIqbaa	I'm still single, in high school, and I've had people like me, but never dated. I don't know how to make you feel more confident, because you gain confidence from yourself, you just need to like who you are, which is hard sometimes. Also, it's true that the worst a crush can do is say no, it's hard to tell someone you like them, but once you do it you feel so much better, and it gets easier.<br>  <br>  Mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090309183756AA2mO6n&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|o5piRiBsaa	Aww, hun, junior high is the awkward stage for everyone (except for those lucky enough not to have an awkward stage).  I remember at that age I was chunky, had bad skin, glasses, and just all-in-all was a big mess!  I can tell you that everything got better around age 17; my body just seemed to sort itself out.  I know it's hard now (TRUST ME, I know!!!), but it really will get better.  You'll get older and not only will you like what you see, but boys will, too!|`|hdcrxbSTaa	you won't stay single forever. tons of teenage girls think that, and it's not true whatsoever. just talk to him, say hi in the hallways and stuff.|`|VLNwmoeQaa	Girl, women up!!!! The guy will come..just pray to God about out it!!!! You can use a makeover if you arent comfy with your look! good luck|`|qywgpkk2aa	your avatar is ugly.|`|0vlm2OZcaa	You're still young and you have your whole life ahead of you so don't worry about your looks.|`|Ti9tKWigaa	Get a paper sack.|`|Y6v0z1hvaa	Hard to say without pictures.<br>  <br>  But guys dig plain girls, truly.

EVERYONE, though they don't admit it. Your self confidence gets tons better in high school, just wait it out and it will get better. It does NOT get all fixed (not at all), or even closed to fixed in high school (you still feel ugly sometimes), but I was miserable in junior high and its a lot better now that I'm in high school. Trust me, just wait it out. <br>  <br>  In middle school I thought there was no possible way that a boy could like me,  I though I would be alone for my whole life, but really just wait it out and you will get tons of boyfriends. Yes, some may turn you down, but so many will be hoping for your affection. <br>  <br>  Advice that I give is to walk through the halls like you are the prettiest girl in the world. Shoulders back, back straight, the whole thing. Smile a lot and maybe get a new hair cut. Get your eyebrows waxed and buy a new outfit. Change your outlook on everything. You will feel so much better.|`|NWkPzcEvaa	The best thing to do is be confident in your self. A good guy likes an all natural girl, and the guys that don't like a true girl aren't worth your time.<br>  <br>  It's life, we all think we're ugly. I'm as skinny as a twig, people are grossed out by it, it's affected almost everything in my life, but it's what makes me me. I'm known to be the girl with not butt or boobs, and have the boney wrists, and I can't see my self not like that. But I've learned to focus on the positive things. =]|`|kUhcypC9aa	I am sure you are not ugly. Just gain confidence and you will become more attractive to the guys :) x|`|oWTXPtxwaa	picturee?

gWdzwaCyaa	Best advice I have for curling hair<br>  <br>  Don't wash your hair everyday because the cleaner it is the more likely the curls are to fall out. <br>  <br>  If I want to curl my hair Saturday night I wash it Friday morning and wear it either down or in a loose pony tail friday and Saturday. Then it is perfect condition (with a bit of grease for grip) <br>  <br>  I use KMS Curl up Spiral spray <a href="http://www.gorgeousshop.co.uk/shop/kms-california-19/curlup-47/kms-california-curlup-hot-spiral-spray-200mls-247.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gorgeousshop.co.uk/shop/kms-c...</a> <br>  <br>  I use my GHD's for the curls. <br>  <br>  Clip the top of your hair up out of the way. The remaining hair, take a section of hair spray on the KMS product, comb it through and use the GHD's to curl. <br>  <br>  Continue like this all the way through your hair. <br>  <br>  Curling your hair everyday for school must take ages! <br>  <br>  Sometimes I use my heated rollers but they take even long to do because you have to roll up all the hair and then wait 30-45 minutes before taking them out. But for a night out it's defo worth it because they are perfect curls and stay in long long time! <br>  <br>  You could always just buy clip in, wavy/curly hair extensions either of E Bay or I've used Jessica Simpson extensions before <a href="http://www.hairuwear.com/jessica.aspx?pgID=998" rel="nofollow">http://www.hairuwear.com/jessica.aspx?pg...</a><br>  <br>  Here's a clip from VideoJug - how to curl hair<br>  <a href="http://www.videojug.com/film/how-to-curl-hair-with-straighteners-2" rel="nofollow">http://www.videojug.com/film/how-to-curl...</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|93C2PZetaa	Ok heres what I do...<br>  Take a small piece of hair (maybe an inch) and put some hold gell in it.  Use a spiral (the kind with the ridges in it) and curl your hair, hold for like twenty seconds and then pull it out, don't unroll it.  once you've got your curls brush them out until they're not sticky anymore, it looks really good when i do it and it holds forever :)|`|JjdMvFN1aa	Try the Tressemme Curl Activator Spray. <br>  What You Do is spray this all over damp hair and start curling.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.blog.makeupmoxie.com/2007/05/big-sexy-hair-without-blowdryer.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.blog.makeupmoxie.com/2007/05/...</a><br>  go to that website --^ for more info.|`|6U4sl15uaa	buy a hair curling gel you can buy these at walmart or walgreens or any store like these|`|Rdjq7swEaa	You should use a curling iron and spray it well many buy shampoo for curly hair to make it curlier hope I helped! <br>  I love your name btw!|`|lgMZJQtwaa	heey i agree with all the other people!|`|f167e988cf95e16dc2862de8ec651915aa	Eat your crusts!|`|l6rSKl46aa	i agree with the other two dudes above|`|5WXuGX1faa	I have that problem too!<br>  I honestly have no idea. I just guess our hair doesn't like to be curly?<br>  Or maybe we just need a better curling iron.<br>  Someone[whos really good with hair] told me that the higher the temperature of the curling iron, the longer they will stay in. My conair curling iron said that i should use temps. from 1-5 for thin delicate hair[which is my hair] but when i do use that temperature, it doesn't hold my curls.<br>  So maybe try turning it up to a hotter temperature?<br>  <br>  Oh and don't listen to the people above mine. Especially the "put it in damp hair and curl" That will fry and burn your hair, believe me. you DO NOT want to do that. And adding extra products in your hair before you curl your hair is bad. It will make your hair look heavy and un-natural. It'll look totally fake!|`|GgBdQqrdaa	your a cutie|`|6aaCfPJiaa	put some mousee in|`|tXeqSv5Qaa	agreed with the first dude
jLnhnDjhaa	Palmer's is really cheap so why not use one every other night|`|9tLmtrp9aa	Hello there, <br>  Oatmeal is good to soothe the skin. You can purchase an Aloe Vera Leaf. Its natural, fresh and cost no more than $2 bucks. You can find the m at your local farmers market or Publix. If you cut it open and apply it to your skin it has anti-inflammatory properties that will help heal your skin very quickly, and minimize the appearance of dark spots. Trust me out of all of the medication I've tried, this is the only thing that I swear by. Its cheap and it actually works. Try this first before you go buying any spot medication, they are usually just gimmicks and people waste allot of money on them every year.|`|e9908650f50aa931662f755c59609eb5aa	I've heard many good things about Vitamin E oil reducing scars.<br>  Basically I would go with Vitamin E, you can take the supplements or get the oil and apply to your face.<br>  <br>  I have a few acne scars, nothing that I am horrified about, I am younger too and hopefully they will vanish soon. :D
JHEeoyONaa	I don't know about where you live, but Pagoda Piercing (usually one of those vendors in malls) pierces your ears for free if you buy a set of earrings. So it depends on which pair you get.|`|kt2i6eKXaa	Go 2 Claires. That's where I went. Plus, you get the cleaning supplies, and a whole bunch of other things that makes the company look more professional. If not, then you can go to Walmart or some mall that'll do piercings. If not, then you might have to do it yourself.|`|8e29d822ee2591d8c0d0032e70287c8baa	Zales for about 400 bucks
Ax4NnJDIaa	Congratulations on decided to get MAC Brushes! They are very high quality, and I have used a lot of brushes from drugstores like Target, CVS, Walgreens, Longs, all sorts of places! But MAC, the investment is waay worth it. Trust me!!<br>  <br>  It can be really very confusing to walk into the MAC store to take a look at their brushes. I think its a good idea that you decided on what types of brushes you want to buy, because MAC has all sorts, and different types for eyeshadow, eyeliner and such.<br>  <br>  A MUST for eyeshadow brushes with MAC is the 239. The bristles are white goat hair, and it is an excellent brush. Always good for a first MAC brush. Always always always. For Blending, you may want a seperate brush, and I recommend the 224. It is a tapered brush. You may see brushes like it, such as the 222, but the 224 is best for blending because it is slightly bigger. It can also give you a wash of color all over your lid, so it's kinda like a two in one brush.<br>  <br>  I like using the 231 for my cream eyeliners, and I guess you could use it for eyeshadow as eyeliner. After all, it is actually meant to be an eye shading brush, but i love it for liner. <br>  <br>  If you want a good angle brush for shading (I was unclear of what you meant with the eyeshadow as eyeliner, so i'm recommending another one) then the 275 is nice also. <br>  <br>  <br>  Blush, Creams and Powders. <br>  A nice starter blush is Melba. It is a matte coral-pink color, and it was my first MAC blush, and I used it for a long long time. You don't really need a ton of blushes you know? but Melba is a nice starter. If you don't like that color, just look around for a nice shade that catches your eye. Try it out on your hand a little bit, and see how you like it.<br>  <br>  Creams. I don't know what you mean by cream but, MAC does sell cream blushes and such. They are basically the same thing, so just search around for one you like.<br>  <br>  Powder. Mac sells loads of powders, from beauty power to ones that set your liquid foundation. If you're looking for one to set foundation, I recommend getting the Studio Fix Powder. It is a foundation in itself, but it sets your foundation nicely. Bronzing Powder is also an option, since we are going into the warmer seasons. Find one that compliments your skin tone. You'll know it when you see it. Mineralized Skin Finishes come in Normal and Natural shades. They brighten up your face, and act sort of as bronzers, but basically finish off your look. I love the Petticoat and So Ceylon Mineralized Skin Finishes. You can get beauty powder also, which is meant to basically give your face a better wash of color. You never want to put blush on right on top of foundation, so Beauty Powder is also an alternative there. It is also more luminous than blush, but not as luminous as a Mineralized Skin Finish or bronzer. You could get the Select Sheer in Loose or Pressed, which is a setting powder, though I prefer Studio Fix Powder.<br>  Go ahead and get the Studio Fix Powder in my opinion, because if you don't like it as a foundation, it's great for touch up during the day.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hope I helped you in some way. Don't be afraid to ask the Makeup Artists at MAC to help you. Be sure to let them know you're new to the brand, and they'll guide you in the right direction. They may set you a bit off track, so keep my answer, and the rest of the answers to this question in mind. Hope i Helped, and good luck!!|`|dGTCQKU8aa	my favorite place to go to is sephora; so, i recommend you go there.<br>  at sephora there are so many different make up brands & the workers are so nice!<br>  they'll help you pick the best things for you skin color & type|`|2AwKt8Peaa	If you go to CVS you can find cheaper versions of what the sell at MAC.  Just jot down the #'s that the people here will tell you to get. Good luck|`|os6OfNlaaa	Ask any of the workers, they are there to help you.|`|Hj6SFfK7aa	If you ask them about the brushes, they will definitely show you what you need. I'd find the brush numbers, but my computer hates the MAC site.<br>  <br>  As for blush, I prefer powder formulas for my oilier cheeks. If you have dry skin, use a cream formula.<br>  <br>  I hate to say this, but your most accurate answers might just come from a MAC counter/store. However, if you don't feel 100% comfortable with an answer they give you, do not walk away with the item you don't want. I did that once and I wasted $15.50.|`|LkOcJRRWaa	ask the mac makeup artist/specialist...they will help you...the mac brushes are a bit expensive though..I got one for over $20....crazy

6npsRIzUaa	Dear lord, don't put foundation on the holes unless you want an infection.<br>  <br>  Calendula spray, a homeopathic remedy, applied while they are healing will help them to heal amazingly fast and will minimize scarring.<br>  <br>  Arnica cream, another homeopathic remedy, works wonders on (healed) scars, it'll either completely get rid of them or reduce them to the point where you'd have to REALLY be looking to see them.<br>  <br>  I used both of these on my healing piercings, both worked amazingly for me.

"<br>  <br>  <br>  edit: haha thumb me down. wow|`|EVbExjIjaa	meh. i just hate uggs because of sheep killing and because the boots are ugly. i mean get some thinner, nicer looking boots you freakin FAGS THAT WEAR FUGGS.|`|0dyIrY8Gaa	i never started wearing them in the first place.|`|ZLdz3FYgaa	will u shut the **** up?|`|NOz2NIMTaa	Hey, smarter, they don't kill sheep for their wool. They SHEAR them, so in other words, they shave off their wool. This is a natural process that has benn practiced for years. If you don't shear the sheep, they can die from heat exhaustion.|`|XJ6RxMQIaa	Yes! Finally! People need to be educated! And most of the dead sheep are discarded (from what I understand) wasting food that could've saved millions of lives. to all you little bit**** who think you look "california cool" in your ugg boots, you don't. We've moved on from uggs, and now most (trendy) Californians try to wear clothes with a cause, not ones that promote wasteful slaughtering of millions of animals. All you girls out there wearing peace shirts, practice what you wear. Promote peace, not killing and mass destruction.|`|fIb6zHXxaa	I don't believe that they have to kill sheep to make UGGS. Sheep skin is skinned off of sheep without hurting them in any way. Yes, there is a strong demand for sheep skin, not because they are killing them but they are skinning it off of the sheep. And yes, the sheep skin is then refined under temperatures. I don't know where people got the fact that you need to kill sheep to make anything.|`|6GJumHfgaa	hahahahahahah. keep up with the demand? I assure you...the planet is not running out of sheep. Low availability and high demand creates higher desire for the product. its called a marketing tool.|`|qgDBnGhfaa	this is not a question<br>  no i will not stop wearing uggs.<br>  but will you quit wasting your time?|`|eoLYNoAYaa	ok. im sorry. but they dont kill the sheep. they just shave their wool off. and that doesnt hurt them. who told you all of this anyway?|`|OFhom4pEaa	Well, I think UGGs are tacky and awful anyways, so I don't wear them, but I sure love mutton and lamb.

190d0e2350e47a93ee950563d0fe8690aa	I would say maybe go to Lord and Taylor and try on Jessica McClintock dresses that are within your price range, they would definitely emphasize your best assets and cover up those you don't like. <br>  <br>  Or stick with empire styled dresses, but that would depend on you and your taste and the price range of the store. My suggestions for some main stores are Macy's, Lord and Taylor, Cache, Nordstrom, Ann Taylor, Charlotte Russe, BCBG Max Azria, Nordstrom Rack, Loehmann's, Filene's Basement, Neiman Marcus's Last Call and Saks's Off 5th. Double check with the last few stores when they get new shipments, like I know Nordstrom Rack has new stock every few weeks and that will give you a better chance of getting a great fitting dress for a great price. If you can find them in your price range, Nicole Miller and Jessica McClintock seem to fit this kind occasion well. <br>  <br>  I was about your size when I was trying on dresses for my 8th grade dance, one of the dresses was a Mary L Couture dress, (this one to be exact <a href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/2887752?Category=&Search=True&SearchType=keywordsearch&keyword=mary+couture+in+All+Categories&origin=searchresults" rel="nofollow">http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/2887752?Cate...</a> ) it looked great but it was too formal and a bit out of my price range for that occasion, and it seems it would be out of your's too. Try it on if you find it though [it is sold at Nordstrom, Loehmann's, Filene's Basement, and Cache] and see if it does work at all because I know you don't want anything too tight. <br>  I hope this helped!|`|irp7z1FMaa	1. <a href="http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/index.ognc?ID=357815&CategoryID=37475&LinkLoc=16904&LinkType=SiteAd&AdID=504281" rel="nofollow">http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...</a><br>  <br>  ^good with blondes, you never said your hair color. good with chest + shoulders<br>  <br>  2. <a href="http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/index.ognc?ID=356420&CategoryID=37475&LinkLoc=16904&LinkType=SiteAd&AdID=504281" rel="nofollow">http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...</a><br>  <br>  ^ i dont know if this is right for you im just showing you for an example-im getting it for this HUGE 8th grade black and white party soon<br>  <br>  3. <a href="http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/index.ognc?ID=357807&CategoryID=29854" rel="nofollow">http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...</a><br>  <br>  ^nice green color, it may be too short i dont know<br>  <br>  4. <a href="http://www4.jcpenney.com/jcp/X6.aspx?DeptID=50455&CatID=54692&GrpTyp=PRD&ItemID=157de9a&attrtype=&attrvalue=&CMID=50455%7c51280&Fltr=&Srt=&QL=F&IND=6&CmCatId=50455|51280|54692" rel="nofollow">http://www4.jcpenney.com/jcp/X6.aspx?Dep...</a><br>  <br>  ^just showing you- im getting this one for my formal 8th grade dance at the end of the year, the theme is circus<br>  <br>  5. <a href="http://www4.jcpenney.com/jcp/X6.aspx?DeptID=50455&CatID=54692&GrpTyp=PRD&ItemID=157dea2&attrtype=&attrvalue=&CMID=50455%7c51280&Fltr=&Srt=&QL=F&IND=4&CmCatId=50455|51280|54692" rel="nofollow">http://www4.jcpenney.com/jcp/X6.aspx?Dep...</a><br>  <br>  ^reaaaalllyyy preeetttyy<br>  <br>  6. <a href="http://www4.jcpenney.com/jcp/X6.aspx?DeptID=50455&CatID=51773&GrpTyp=PRD&ItemID=1650df8&attrtype=&attrvalue=&CMID=50455%7c51280%7c54692&Fltr=&Srt=&QL=F&IND=14&CmCatId=50455|51280|51773" rel="nofollow">http://www4.jcpenney.com/jcp/X6.aspx?Dep...</a><br>  <br>  ^cuuute<br>  <br>  7. <a href="http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/index.ognc?ID=357868&CategoryID=42769" rel="nofollow">http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...</a><br>  <br>  ^reaaally preeetty, shows off calves [same as the 5th one i thinkk]<br>  <br>  8. <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AgKRp8eCguu06iKVB9YTKyTsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090309152542AAZTtLU">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  ^ this is one of my questions where i showed 7 dresses that are black and white but a lot of them are really pretty-you might like them<br>  <br>  i hope i helped<br>  if you want more options you can ask<br>  <3|`|QWevnlTUaa	please don't buy anything and davids bridal or the goodwill.<br>  <br>  try forever21 and windsor<br>  <br>  maybe guess, marciano, black and white house|`|ZWJae0BJaa	definately stick to something black if your worries about how your figure will look, because black is very slimming. get a halter because it will compliment your shoulders, and they usually have a v-neck, and it should do for a school dance with a strap code. i would also go to dillards, they have amazing dresses around this time of year. and dont let anyone tell you you have to have a short dress or that long dresses are 'the style' this year. just get something that makes you feel comfortable.|`|ri4RCtLUaa	i shop at a store called Windsor for any of my occasions that need a dress...that have the cutest stuff for any occation and style<br>  <br>  but since i dont know ur specific style...here is the link to the dresses from 70-100 dollars but there are other catorgories too.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.windsorstore.com/shop_category.aspx?id=745&v=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.windsorstore.com/shop_categor...</a><br>  <br>  hope i could help [:|`|zahwGJh5aa	I am the exact same height as you but weigh about 125 (with curves galore).

I40zKVdkaa	Six years is a long time...I dont think that exercise will work if it hasnt up until now. I say go for the surgery- but only if you're willing to spend the money, and only if it will make you feel better about yourself. If it wont change the way you feel, then theres really no point in getting it is there? Also, if you're planning on having another child, you may want to hold off on the surgery until after the second child is born. But after six years I imagine you must be tired of the extra skin, make sure you get an accredable plastic surgeon to ensure the results last.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|hXYjkCGpaa	Maybe this will help you decide: <a href="http://best-cosmetic-surgeries.com/the-popularity-of-cosmetic-surgeries/tummy-tuck-surgery" rel="nofollow">http://best-cosmetic-surgeries.com/the-p...</a>|`|KZNVb7ehaa	i have it too!! I am only 21! i had a baby 8 months ago. i have extra skin. the plastic surgeon said that is the only way to get a flat stomach.  but i might have another baby some day so i  am going to hold off on it for now, but i did just get implants!!! i would totally get another surgery. if it really bothers you then go for it.. it will totally be worth it. I am only about 115 lbs by the way and i still have it :(
sLGehA4raa	Get the word "match" out of your formal vocabulary. Well-dressed men do not "match," they "coordinate." Fortunately for you, black and white go with everything.<br>  <br>  Black jacket and trousers, black cummerbund and self-tied bow tie, white turndown collar shirt. It's foolproof. Colors are not.|`|xJwPKtX9aa	well you could just wear a mandarin tie. that would be more fashionable.|`|xN5u1eRKaa	Black tux with a Mandarin vest. I love when the vest matches the dress. Soo cute!|`|pQKgJ5Woaa	black with a mandarin colored vest.<br>  if you don't want a vest, just all black would be fine.<br>  if you want a splash a color... just all black with a colorful tie. maybe mandarin if you want to match? or another color that matches mandarin?

vut2ZCApaa	i think any hairstyle will look good on you as long as you have the confidence to go with it.|`|JHEeoyONaa	Your hair should be proportional to your body. In other words, girls who are really skinny, shouldn't have big hair, because it makes them look even smaller (not in a good way). But personally, judging by the description, I don't think you'll have to worry about proportions or anything, just go for it. Just make sure you really want to cut your hair, or you might regret it. Good luck(:|`|ebgwqq5Naa	I don't like that combination at all. Most guys don't like it either and do make fun of girls with weird haircuts.

I know a lot of fat people who have short hair with some really nice cuts and they look good. just make sure the cut that ur getting has some definition and that will make all the difference.|`|sOO93u5Oaa	I'm sure it will be fine.

But  my friend did and I didn't really like it..|`|TuIzJiqNaa	sure a fat girl can have short hair, my mom too have it.|`|Xu8FHAQgaa	Hi. I don't think it'd make you look fatter, unless your face is chubby because then it will add more to the face, soo if your face is the right shape, then go for it..I'd say if you have a rounder face or oval then get it cut short like you want it. :)|`|z3uUtr33aa	i think short hair looks better on bigger people. my mom's heavy and when she wears long extensions they look horrible on me, she also has a big face so it's weird to have big hair with a big body to me. <br>  <br>  -tasha|`|MKYAgFOsaa	If your fat..

Qa3yKIoDaa	People just feel prettier with makeup.<br>  I think makeup should be only worn on special occasions.<br>  IMO, it's just a waste of time and energy in the morning..<br>  but people have different preferences...|`|35PQUYqraa	isnt make up on your body you dumb shitt!<br>  geeeez people these days skanky make up=most likely skany person you whoree:)<br>  <br>  you are welcomee:) i should deserve the 10 points for this answer definatelyy!|`|HzCBOwlyaa	well it doesnt have an effect on the body<br>  its not like if you wear lip gloss its going to make you look skinny or fat.<br>  it will just bring out things in your facial features.<br>  maybe give your face a younger or older look depending on what and how your using it AND how much you use!|`|d5t5XgfVaa	um in the future your gonna notice that your skin is gonna looker wrinkler and uglyier.. if you wear lots of it, i wuld say dont anymore cuz it does ruin it:)|`|9FOHmjN3aa	Makeup makes me feel more confident about myself.|`|sPDQIxJTaa	makes me feel pretty.|`|QsWZhc4baa	If you haven't started wearing make-up yet, don't. I started wearing make-up when I was about eleven and now I have the inability to be seen in public without it. I feel like I'm not pretty if I'm not wearing make-up. It's not bad to wear a little mascara, but don't over do it. Trust me, it's best to make the natural look work for you, that way you can look great and be confident with or without make-up on!|`|yUmYuP48aa	Wearing Make up makes you stand out. It does no damage to your eyes,or cheeks, but sometimes wearing too much foundation from a brand not very good can cause pimples. People usually try make up once, then they think they get to plain without it, It just gets addicting. Eyeliner makes your eyes pop, Foundation and blush cover thing, and  eyeshadow gives pizzaz to your eyes! Thanks !<br>  Please give me best answer.|`|jUuYMVqiaa	makeup makes me feel very pretty and emphasizes my eyes, eyebrows, skin everything.<br>  but i have to warn you i cant even go out in public without having on at least eyeliner or eyebrow pencil or bare minerals. i feel ugly.<br>  <br>  so makeup can hurt/help you.<br>  <br>  but thats for you to decide: do you want to emphasize your looks or feel pretty with or without it?<br>  <br>  maybe thats just me tough..|`|iUDrNbcxaa	i feel more confident when i know i look amazing.|`|a1KT2SQlaa	makes me feel prettier! that makes me feel better about myself
PaZYsgGRaa	they sound like they weren't serious, they might just prefer Hollister. It's clearly casual clothes and not high fashion and anyone could tell you that.|`|EVbExjIjaa	because they only want to wear hollister and abercrombie clothes because every1 else wears them. HAHA WHAT WANNABES :P<br>  <br>  i mean, who would spend like 30 bucks on a plain t shirt that has "hollister" on it?? i mean, buy a t shirt for like 5 bucks at wetseal or something.<br>  <br>  also, i think the "dressy" clothes at hollister/abercrombie are cute, but 40 bucks for it? You can buy it at forever21 or something for less!|`|l5zJ1bldaa	because they see everyone else wearing it.|`|EBKPbkj7aa	Hahahahaha, cuz they're idiots.<br>  I mean I don't have anything against Hollister or Abercrombie, but that's a total duntz move.<br>  <br>  I guess they NEVER heard of Versace, YSL, Valentino, Chanel, Dior, Fendi, Mulberry and all those high end brands. They must be WAYYY too into hollister/a&f|`|9LDGmQ4Aaa	Hahaha! Yes, they are brainwashed if they think that Hollister is "real fashion." I have nothing against Hollister, but next to Gucci and Valentino, Hollister definitely loses.|`|Hp6GLCopaa	Hollister is the BEST store ever!!!!!!!!!!!!! They have the best cloethes ever and they are seriously high fashion! They have the hottest cloethes there. I think YOU are the one who is brain washed!|`|cad424bdc12ca4e21c2f135d81a91d02aa	They are brainwashed by society. They like other girls to see their "labels" and brag. I hate it!|`|iaLVRwBnaa	because most middle and high schoolers consider it to be high fashion because they don't know any better. at that age those brands are considered to be "cool" ones to wear. when i was in high school i remember people used to want to wear abercrombie and hollister because everyone knew the logo. everyone know the stitching on the back pockets of jeans. if someone would've come to my high school wearing true religion jeans for example - which is much more pricey than abercrombie and hollister - no one wouldn't have cared at that time because no one at my high school even know what true religion was. <br>  <br>  it depends on where you grew up and what the affluency level is like in your area. most typical places abercrombie and hollister is considered the expensive and cool thing at that age. i didn't realize what nordstrom was and the brands they carried until i was in college where i was surrounded by more affluent kids who grew up wearing designer stuff and instead of bragging about their abercrombie shopping sprees in high school they were bragging about nordstrom shopping sprees since like middle school.|`|4a3082fdd27954f83d41c22c5367e1fdaa	Haha, I guess it's beacuase of all the porn they offer. All the sexy models are wearing it. It's summery, and chill looking, not to mention very preppy. It's for skinny people so it probably makes them feel better that they can wear it. Not to mention little girls enjoy it because they think they're cool for wearing what all the older girls are wearing, so they grow up thinking that's what makes them cool.|`|96LYhPOFaa	Are you brainwashed? anyone who pays hundreds of dollars for hideous clothing just because it has chanel or gucci on it is blantanly stupid. 95% of the time, people in high fashion clothes look just as hilariously pathetic as the ones with shirts that have ambercrombie stamped all over them.|`|opaMeWyIaa	I Love Hollister and Abercrombie..<br>  And I like all the other stores like you said above.<br>  (But I don't really get clothes there.. More Purses and Shoes)<br>  <br>  But I Know it's not High Fashion.<br>  <br>  Who would think that?.. It's just cute.<br>  <br>  = ]|`|Y64OGuTIaa	Well<br>  to most teens.<br>  Hollister , abercrombie, aeropostale<br>  are high to them cause<br>  at their age<br>  its their name brand fashion clothing<br>  and those gucci stuff wont occur to them in a bit<br>  :)<br>  i was there once.|`|hdcrxbSTaa	i don't know, it's stupid<br>  hollister and abercrombie are cheap compared to actual high fashion.
BwEN0hWAaa	that looks pretty cool in black and grey...maybe throw some red in there or something (not a lot)|`|8THz1sp9aa	Most of this has open space so I would stick to black and grey.|`|XjMJOt8Kaa	ask for grey shading that would look nice and make it look like its blended into your skin. You can also add white, or blue that would look nice to because they both kind of like heaven-ish colors. <br>  Good luck ;]|`|br1FB5rraa	I think you should have it black and grey. But wit a hint of light blue in there as well. If you add a bunch of color to it, I think it would make it look tacky|`|8FrUhGsNaa	well in the event down the line you regret your tattoo.. adding color makes it harder to remove. <br>  <br>  but to answer ur question i think just black would look good.|`|AA11489373	on the tips you should put may b some gold, and throw in a lill' gold in the script also

Really a lot can change in a few years you might not feel very pretty but a lot of people are way more unfortunate. A little makeup and you're good to go. Natural beauty is the best and most precious. <br>  Seriously you're not ugly or even plain your pretty.

You are a very pretty young woman. You can add a little color with some light make-up if you want to. And there a lots of things you can do with that nice long hair. You are only 15.

rGci1ehoaa	DANGEROUSLY DARK BY SWEDISH BEAUTY.. I FOUND A LINK TO A PLACE WHO SELLS IT FOR 20 BUCKS.. MY TANNING SALON CHARGES 40.. BUT I RECENTLY JUST BOUGHT MY OWN ESB TANNING BED...

I'm a freakishly pale redhead who would much rather wear leggings and tights year-round than blind passersby with my whiteness, but my mum talked me into trying this stuff out. I use the kind for Medium Skin Tones because the change is more noticeable (the Light Skin Tones branch does nothing whatsoever) without being obvious. No streaks, no nastiness, no orange hue...and even better, the scent is wonderful! It keeps my legs soft and glowing, no matter what. I put it on every three or four days in the spring and summer, and now I can't stop looking at my beautiful legs!<br>  <br>  I found a buy-one-get-one-free deal at CostCo / BJ's / Sam's Club, but I'm positive it's also at Target, etc. for a great price.<br>  <br>  Check it out here: <a href="http://jergens.com/Our_Collection/Product_Detail.asp?ProductID=34" rel="nofollow">http://jergens.com/Our_Collection/Produc...</a><br>  <br>  What I do is shave, dry my legs, then apply the lotion. I wait a couple minutes and then take a damp washcloth and wipe the tops of my feet, my ankles, the backs of my feet, and my knees (since those areas typically tan at a different rate). And then...voilá! You're lovely. (: (:

It keeps the heat from damaging your hair. I like Chi. You can get it from any hair salon. If you can't afford that, you can get generic from Sally's. Sounds like your sister needs to get her ends trimmed and use better products. Tell her to use leave in conditioner as well.|`|zoTdLkJTaa	get some thermal heat protecting spray for your hair - this will prevent heat damage by a ton ^_____^<br>  <br>  ucan buy it @ ur local pharmacy<br>  <br>  you can also think to get AUSSIE 3 MINUTE MIRACLE for your hair - it moisturizes and helps damaged hair

6SasHFPBaa	It's all the same.  Aritizia does own TNA, and the clothing is, of course, over-priced.  Same in Aritzia and the TNA store.  There are a bunch of Aritizias, though - Yorkdale, Promenade, Vaughan Mills, Sherway Gardens.... Once in a while one store will have some random amazing sale, but don't count on that.  Sorry not to be too helpful!|`|hnN1ibklaa	Dear people answering Aritzia owns TNA. It is true Aritzia is the owner of Talula National Athletic, but they do in fact have separate TNA stores in select cities.<br>  You will get much better selection at a TNA store, and in some cases a better price, although the prices usually don't differ all too much. Maybe ten or twenty dollars.<br>  I live in Calgary, so I've never been to a TNA store.<br>  But it couldn't hurt to do some comparison shopping, go to Aritzia one day, TNa the next.|`|yqVojuXVaa	Lol, Aritzia owns TNA. I think...Lol<br>  Same prices. But there's a slight chance that the TNA store will have more selection...|`|EBKPbkj7aa	TNA store has a larger selection and the store is more TNA-esque if that makes sense. The prices are generally the same but they have limited sales sometimes, it's like -$5 off.

WgeuYyd2aa	Blow your cheeks often with water, like how you do for rinsing the teeth while brushing and eat 2 tablespoon butter everyday in the morning in empty stomach.|`|LRGX1ximaa	I would say to eat a bit more than usual. For example, if you cap your calories around 2000 usually, then try maybe 2700.|`|66Sx6Troaa	adding 700 calories to your daily intake will add fat onto your butt cheeks let alone face cheeks as well as everywhere else lol... so think wisely!
jJLc6uG1aa	You should leave the same earring in for months in cartilage.  It takes forever to heal.  Just keep it clean and keep twisting the post/earring around so it doesn't stick.<br>  Changing it every few days just irritates it and it will take longer to heal.|`|Q9HzjDWZaa	maybe you didnt leave it on for the right amount of time before you could change it.|`|JfOuzOJGaa	You're not supposed to remove piercings within two weeks of piercing them, so that's why.  Additionally, cartilage piercings take way longer to heal than lobe piercings.  Generally about a year, so having them close while going to change the jewelry is pretty normal.  Get it done by a professional who will give you aftercare instructions since you clearly don't know what you're doing.|`|3QvHE3JZaa	you're not supposed to take it out. it needs time to heal first before you can switch out the jewelry.<br>  it takes way longer than 2 weeks to properly heal.<br>  <br>  had you gone to a professional to get it pierced, they would have told you that.|`|t9hU40hwaa	I would get a sterling silver half hoop and leave it in just clean it with alcohol.  It is going to take awhile my belly ring took almost a year and still was getting hard untill I put alcohol on it I ended up taking it out so just be patient and clean it daily.|`|JDmc46wBaa	thats cuz u should wait like 6 weeksn before you take it out.. then you wont have to constantly re pierce it

fQ0T2ZHfaa	You're questions tells me you're a nooblet to the tattoo scene. Yes you can get ripped off; but most of the time the fee and availability of the artist directly reflects the quality of the work that is done. <br>  <br>  e.g. Having to make an appointment, and paying more than the usual MRSA ridden AIDS shop.|`|l7E3EreXaa	If anyone gives you a price quote without knowing what it is you want, dont believe them. The prices can vary so much that to say "Well, it'll costs this much..." cant be trusted.|`|ka4hULq3aa	Depending on where you live and the artist who will do the work, you are looking at 80.00 to 300.00.  Also the amount of detail in your tattoo is taken into consideration.
jUuYMVqiaa	it could be a combination of weight and material. i have some rings that i can only wear when i am at like the beach or like if im only going to wear if for a few hours.<br>  i would try to leave out your belly button ring if you are arnt going to be showing it or what have you. (if this is possible to leave it out for long periods of time). i have found leaving it out and only putting one in when i want to have one showing (like in a bathing suit) is the best way to keep it from getting irritated from cheap jewelry.<br>  <br>  (edit) in the long run heavy jewelry can also make the skin over it thin out faster, thus leaving you with a belly button ring that has to much bar hanging out and what not. unfortunately i have this prob :\|`|8e29d822ee2591d8c0d0032e70287c8baa	You do sound like you have an infection and if you are not using the best quality stuff you are going to have some real issues there|`|Ym5jzEa8aa	Yeah, it is possible. It happened to me. I had mine done for almost a year with absolutely no problems and then I changed the jewelry. I could tell immediately it was too heavy, but I didn't really think it would hurt anything. But I had the same issues as you did. The only thing is, make sure it's not cheap jewelry either, mine was made of some alloy, and I had an allergic reaction going on down with it too :\ So definitely stick with titanium or surgical steel or something along those lines, lol. but if I were you I would change it back before it get any worse; mine ended up migrating too far because I didn't know what was wrong with it at first, and I had to take it out.|`|JfOuzOJGaa	It's possible to wear jewelry that's too heavy, but it sounds like it might just be the quality of the jewelry that's causing the irritation.  Do you know what the material is?  I'd switch the jewelry to one you know isn't going to bother you.<br>  <br>  I had bought a barbell I really liked and it was causing my piercing which I'd had for a few years to become inflamed and sore.  Once I changed back to my previous jewelry, it went back to normal.

The problem is with colors that are pink, purple, blue, etc. they are only semi-permanant meaning they will wash out after about six to eight washes. But usually the first wash the color will fade, and you must keep redoing it. If you are going to do it at home at least go to a beauty supply and ask how you can do it. Usually they will recommend bleaching cream. Ask and they'll be glad to help you. It should cost you about $30.00 to $60.00 depending where you live to do it at home.<br>  <br>  Btw Manic panic  lightening kit is good like they said, but get more then one kit if you have alot of hair.|`|Rj5bKD7Baa	Belive it or not using food dye works, it comes out when you wash it two, but sometimes it wont work on dark hair.

d36da7bbff05d23acceb010110cea63eaa	Eye makeup wasn't prevalent in the Middle Ages, unlike in the Ancient Middle East. Phoenicians and Eygptians rimmed their eyes with kohl but there is nothing in historical documents showing that the practice transferred to Europe in medieval times. Noble women and wealthy women did use makeup but it was to acheive the effect of languid paleness. Some of the items they used were lemons and saffron for the hair to make it blonde, and various plants to make their faces pale.|`|OeFNGqbzaa	from what i know cleopatra used crushed bugs as her makeup|`|IIIKFDOoaa	In medieval Europe all sins were considered be of devil and were forbidden, including, certainly, medieval makeup. However, it is known that manufacture and selling of the 17th century makeup and perfumery have been advanced already in Italy since the I-IX centuries and the center of it was the city of Kopje (near Naples). The development of the 19th century makeup flourished.|`|BxMInUUNaa	I don't think it was used in the medieval ages, such a thing was considered evil.

jUuYMVqiaa	1) really anywhere that is clean and knowledgeable.<br>  <br>  2) getting a nik is a diff kind of pain, but the belly button is just skin, so if it didnt hurt for you to get your lobes pierced then most likely your belly button wont hurt too bad.<br>  <br>  3) usually around $30-50, but 50 is a little expensive, i think mine cost 40, but it was years ago? so im not sure.<br>  <br>  4) really you can do things right after, but its good to stay out of pools, ocean, sun, tanning beds, hot tubs, (other dirty places) for a good week or two after you get pierced.<br>  <br>  5) belly buttons take about a month or longer to heal, up to a year to completely heal (like you can take it out for as long as you want and w/e)<br>  <br>  6) clean it twice a day with nonfragrant antibacterial soap. avoid cleaning it with alcohol, twisting it, touching it with dirty hands and irritating it by knocking it or pulling on it. warm sea salt soaks are good to do for about 15min 1-2 times a week. (fill up a cup about a quarter full of warm sea salt water and put it up to your belly button so that it forms like a suction cup and then carefully lay on the floor with the cup upside down over your belly button for about 15 min.) you clean it for about a month, but after that you just clean whenever it needs to be cleaned. ive had mine for about 5 years and i clean it maybe once or twice a year?<br>  <br>  good luck with your new body bling!|`|Op37pHd3aa	Most people told me it dosen't hurt at all but for me it hurt pretty bad.

Gew6pZhbaa	I've done my fair share of research on St. Ives Apricot Scrub, and I strongly advise you to stop using it. They're not micro-beads like more exfoliaters use, they're broken pieces of apricot seeds with jagged edges. They leave tiny cuts in your skin, and eventually cause broken cappelaries. I used the scrub for a while because it was cheap, and luckily stopped soon enough before any noticeable damage was done. It can definitely cause scarring if used long-term and the damage is severe enough.|`|JfOuzOJGaa	The only way the product clogs your pores would be if you didn't wash it off.  It doesn't damage your skin.  The beads aren't abrasive and neither are the other ingredients.  You just gently massage it on your face in circular motions, then rinse it off.|`|Ti9tKWigaa	I find that it doesn't work, and just hurts like crazy. <br>  <br>  The hard pieces are actually apricot pits, and if you swallow them, they react with stomach acid to form cyanide.

Or even consignment stores or boutiques (you can find original one of a kind dresses here) But since you have time...you can also look at dept stores for sales!  If your small than definately go shorter on your length.  I would stay simple with your dress and dress up with accessories.  Always remember you will be in this dress all night so get something that is going to be comfortable to you and flattering.

c6203fb410232a459c67af16360d28b5aa	They are right. A general rule of thumb: blonde hair/blue eyes should wear: browns, purples, silvers golds, greens, some pink and use blue sparingly, it can really make your eye color pop!!!! <br>  Brunettes with blue eyes: see above, avoid most pinks (ie: frosty pinks)<br>  Brunttes with brown/hazel eyes: any color, use browns sparingly, golds can make your eye color pop if used correctly, greens would also be a good choice...greens with a touch of gold would be hot!<br>  Dark hair and dark skin: no browns, avoid excessive cream colors (unless you are using them to highlight), golds, blues sparingly, highlight with silvers, purples with gold would also look hot!<br>  I hope this helps!!!|`|2b4add485bed0e999da671a57977906eaa	It is tacky to match your eyeshadow to your outfit.  Your eyeshadow should be a color that will bring out the color of your eyes.|`|47c3a366d862e382515baa2bb72ec387aa	I wouldn't match eyeshadow to my outfit, but I would use colors that match obviously.  I'm a big fan of the smokey eye look w/ a light glossy lip.  It's very now, and you can wear it with pretty much everything.  During the day less is more, but vamp it up at night!|`|55bc89e939225460d88061028b1e0df5aa	If you are wearing a lot of differnt colors wear the color that you are wearing the least of. At night always try to match you eyeshadow to your tops and you well be ready for any type of party. If you are going out during the morning or noon try to wear light colors browns, light pinks etc. If you are a teen just try and have fun with your make up but don't put to much on you could get pimples.

They want to bring out the outfit, the face has to make a statement. Of course, u not going put blue eyeshadow all over and u wearing blue, r do red eyeshadow and u wearing red. U could do something like an all over base color on eye. I choose from a light tan family or pink for a basis then i work on the highlight(under the brow), the crease shade and the lid shade. Sometimes I use 3, sometimes on 2. Look at Project Runway, how the designer chooses the colors they want to go with their outfits. Most time they ask do u want something simple or dramatic, dark or fresh..not sure at all get tips from make-up artist. Check out celeb mag. Their is a section showing hair style and make-up. Just like smoky eye effect, u don't have to use just black with it. U can use similar colors, like purple to achieve this. If it looks too weird, probable made a wrong choice. Good luck.|`|88ef899683eaf02b99ab949795d93e02aa	Your eye color and your skin complexion.|`|AA12073455	It's not that your NOT SUPPOSE to, you CAN if you want. Normally I use colors that compliment or in the same family of what I'm wearing, or yes, your skin complexion.

That way you'll look good no matter what you wear!
JJaNEsOBaa	you sound to be cool toned.<br>  which means obviously you should be staying away from peach! and orange.<br>  the best type of blush for you would be something brownish in color like a bronzer, since you already have  the pink in your skin.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Techniques you can use to find your natural blush color:<br>  <br>  Bend down and touch your toes with your fingers for two minutes and then stand back up. (You may need to climb a flight of stairs if this doesn't work). The color of your cheeks that is there at this moment is the right blush color for your face.<br>  <br>  Look to see what color your cheeks look like after you have been out in the cold or exercising at the gym.<br>  <br>  To find your natural blush color you can also pinch your cheeks and wait for a few seconds.<br>  <br>  Another helpful way to find the right blush color for your skin tone is to match it with your current lip color.  If you favor pink tones for your lips, it’s likely that a pink blush color will also work well on your cheeks.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you look best in these fashion colors: blue, green, aqua, plum, lavender, and other cool water tones, then you should choose a blush in cool tones of Crimson, Plum, Wine, Pastel Pink, Blue-Red, TerraCotta, Peach, or Rose.<br>  <br>  If you look best in these fashion colors: orange, pink, peach, red, olive-green, and othewarm earth tones, then you should choose a blush in warm tones of Coral, Bronze, Brown, Warm Red, or Hot Pink.|`|3cQNxsqHaa	GET A PINK ROSE OR PEACHY KIND OF BLUSH!

That's what makes it come off--its a really strong chemical and is not safe for your face. I wouldn't recommend using it at all!

KwNpyp3saa	You should not wash it everyday. When you do, you are reactivating the oils and it is making your hair oily. This happens because your head thinks it needs more oil because of all of the shampooing, it produces more oil. You should shampoo your hair about 3 times a week and condition it every time you shampoo. <br>  <br>  Try using V05. This is what my teenaged son uses.|`|VtWTWNFFaa	i suggest AXE.|`|pC2JTJgpaa	there is no difference between guys or girls shampoo and cond. it all depends on your hair type , oily, dry, colored, ETC...

If your hair is prone to get greecy, then you SHOULD shampoo everyday. Or like 5 times a week.  <br>  <br>   i like herbal essences for shampoo and conditioner.  Whatever scent you use for herbal essenses shampoo, just get the conditioner.  you should use conditioner every day, even if you dont use shampoo.<br>  <br>  When you use the conditioner, (the same one that you use for shampoo, dont try and mix and match, it just doesnt work)    your hair will be silkeyer and smoother.

It makes my hair straight!
zzp1o9mlaa	The condition of nails reflect the quality of tissue production in the body as nails are considered to be the waste product of bones (asthi dhatu) Healthy nails are pink,smooth and evenly shaped. Healthy nails are often a sign of good health, while bad nails are often a tip off to more serious problems. Dermatologists say healthy nails are an important part of overall health. The steps in cultivating and maintaining healthy nails are quite simple.<br>  <br>  Many less than desirable nail conditions can be avoided through proper care, but some actually indicate an illness that requires attention. But a little basic nail care can go a long way to keeping your nails in healthy condition. Keep nails on the shorter side, which are easier to care for. Soak toenails if they are thick or difficult to cut, if you are diabetic, you may need a health care professional to help with trimming diseased nails. Like a great new haircut or a terrific skin care regimen, healthy,well-manicured nails are an integral part of a neat, pulled-together appearance- one that can work as an asset in both the social and the business world.<br>  <br>  There are several nail problems that are caused due to hereditary factors, lack of proper care, negligence and vitamin and protein deficiencies in your diet. After diet, stress is the next important factor causing nail problems. Minerals, calcium, vitamins all are the essential components of our balanced diet. Consume a high fiber diet with plenty of green leafy vegetables and reduce your weight if you are overweight. If you are concerned that your diet may not be balanced and healthy you should consult a medical or nutritional professional.<br>  <br>  Toenails are a great indicator of the health of your feet. Toenails of people of all ages can undergo a range of changes, some of which are relatively common. Major toenail problem culprits are incorrectly fitting shoes, which press too tightly on the toenails. The main nutritional tip of nail care is to acquire plenty of vitamins such as vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin B12, as all these works on your finger and toenails. The fungi that cause onychomycosis affect the toenails about four times more often than fingernails and, like many organisms that cause disease, they grow where it's warm and moist. Most often, nail fungus appears in the toenails because socks and shoes keep the toenails dark, warm, and moist.<br>  <br>  Also nails can reveal a lot about the body's internal health like healthy nails are often a sign of good health that may require high protein diet while bad nails often shows sign of serious health problems. Toenail fungus is a living organism that thrives in dark, damp environments such as under and around nails. Nail Fungus is a tough condition to have, not only it damages your nail, but it is also an embarrassing problem that affects around 13% of people across America. Nail fungus is more popular among old adults for several reasons, including decreased blood circulation, much years of vulnerability to fungi and because nails may rise more slowly and thicken with aging, making them more vulnerable to transmission. Having realistic expectations about how long it will take to get rid of nail fungus is as important as following your doctor's instructions. In our view, Zeta Clear is the first and best option for natural nail fungus treatment.<br>  <br>  There are many natural remedies and supplements, which can be helpful for you to give natural nail care. These are some of the vitamins and proteins which can be helpful for you to get healthy nail care. There are many Herbal care products in the market, which ensures healthy nails. Zeta Clear Nail Care includes the concentrated essence of a substance, which creates a relieving effect on our nails and toes and brings about the desired effect. Apply the Zeta Clear with brush applicator to affected nail three times per day as or as your health care provide suggests.|`|sOkTUYq7aa	rub cuticle cream on them.  there's one by Burt's Bees called lemon cuticle cream ,  It smells awesome and it works great!|`|lG5Xl7UQaa	When you go get them filled or redone whatever you do they should have cuticle polish there for you to buy and apply it everyday! lol|`|4MqkgMzDaa	Moisturize your hands and nails all the time. Protect them when you wash dishes or garden by wearing gloves. Cut them then allow them to grow, then cut them and repeat for a while. I've found this actually makes my nails longer and less brittle.

JTjL9eD7aa	I once went through 6 CHIs in less than two years between my mother and I, which is insane, because we both take VERY good care of such things. CHI does a great job straightening and curling, however, it is not durable. From cords fraying for no reason to fuses blowing out of the blue, CHIs have proven overpriced to me. One flat iron that works just as well and is half the price is Solia, which is sold at Folica.com. They are $80-$90 and I recommend the 1" iron. DON'T BUY A CHI! Like I said, they do work well, but you can get the same results for half the price and, Solia's flat irons have lasted me up to 2 years... not 2 months like CHI. I've always been told that I have gorgeous hair, and it's usually straight... I will never buy anything but Solia again.|`|4aGoWKtEaa	Folica.com|`|ddXQeEvNaa	Your best bet is just going to Trade Secret. They're the only place I know of with a lifetime warranty.

fc3246ddfee6dfec5c6f69279255bd86aa	Before you Start <br>  Always apply makeup to clean skin (follow the routine appropriate for your skin type). <br>  <br>  Make sure you have all the appropriate makeup tools and products you need.<br>   <br>  Use a magnifying mirror to check your blending <br>  <br>   Eyeshadow<br>  All of the options for building an eye design are too numerous to list here. The following is a basic application that can be adapted to create a variety of looks: <br>  <br>  Typically, the lightest color is applied to the entire eyelid and to the edge of the eyebrow. (The general rule is that the larger or more prominent the eyelid area is compared with the under-brow area, the darker or deeper the eyelid color can be; the smaller the eyelid area is compared with the under-brow area, the brighter or lighter the eyelid color can be.) Select a deeper color from the same or a complementary color family to shade the crease. Practice your application and blend well; the goal is not to have obvious edges of color. Remember, lighter colors bring things forward and highlight, dark colors recede and add depth and shading. <br>  <br>   Eyeliner<br>  Position the brush, pencil, or applicator as close to the lashline along the eyelid as possible. Then draw a line from the inner to outer corner using one fluid stroke, following the curvature of the eyelid. As a general rule, do not extend the line past the outer corner of the eye or hug the tear duct area of the eye. At first, keep the line as thin as possible, and if a thicker line is desired, repeat the process either across the entire lash line or simply on the outer third of the lid along the lashes. <br>  <br>  Generally, the line along the lower lashes should be thinner and a less-intense color than the upper liner. Make sure that the two lines meet at the back corner of the eye. As a general rule, the larger the eyelid area, the thicker and softer the eyeliner should be. The smaller the eyelid area, the thinner and more intense the liner should be. <br>  <br>  For health reasons, avoid lining the rim of the eye. <br>  <br>   Eyebrow Shaping<br>  Use a color that closely matches the color of your brows rather than your hair color or a color you think would look better than what already exists. Apply powder brow color using a wedge brush, working in the direction the hair grows. Use a light touch, with short, quick motions, and avoid the temptation to exaggerate the shape of the brow by arching it severely or extending the brow into the temple area. <br>  <br>   Mascara<br>  If you use a lash curler, it is best to use it before you apply mascara. Squeeze gently with even pressure. Hold for a few seconds as you “walk” the curler along the length of the eyelashes, and release slowly. Apply mascara to the upper lashes using long, sweeping strokes. Be sure to begin as close to the lash root as possible and brush up and out. Use an old, cleaned-up mascara wand to remove any clumping that occurs. <br>  <br>  Apply mascara to the lower lashes by holding the wand perpendicular to the eye and parallel to the lashes (using the tip of the wand). If necessary, use a tissue to wipe excess mascara off the brush before applying to the lower lashes. <br>  <br>  FOR THE COLORS:<br>  <br>  Natural is best!<br>  If you are just hanging out and not doing anything special, natural is the better way to go! YOu also don't have to spend 40 minutes in front of the mirror doing make-up every day!<br>  If it is a special occasion, like prom, a wedding, darker make-up is ok! <br>  <br>  FOR WEBSITE: <br>  Check out this website.

There are 4 ranges that are possible to be sung.  Bass, Tenor, Alto, Soprano.  There is also alto 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and Soprano 1st, 2nd, 3rd.  I am assuming that you are not an adult, so you are most likely an alto.  Just sing what you have to in the notes that are comfortable to sing.  I am in advanced choir.  Just make sure that you have good rythm and can skip an octave while singing.  The day before your audition rest your voice and drink tea, it helps me before appearences.  And to be more dramatic, practice in front of a mirrorr.  This is good for facial expression.  we are more aware of ourselves in front of mirrorrs, Without seeing ourselves we think that we are putting more emotion into it when we are not.  and work on projection. projection in an extremely important part of theater.   GOOD LUCK!!!|`|6fc8795bd29f57b629bbd697f8cde61faa	hey my friends go through this alot. <br>  okay buy shoes that fit well and are comfy. then strech them about until the heel is a bit soft. <br>  never never try to stretch ur vocals too much.. they can cause ur throat a lot of pain and loose ur voice. just play scales up the piano repetitively. soon you'll add more notes to ur range. but don't try and sing notes too high for ur voice. (when u start to kind of shout)<br>  a good technic to practice ur voice  is to sing whenever you can. (bumblebee bumblebee up the scale) but not too much.<br>  give ur voice alot of rest for at least 3 days.<br>  remember don't stress too much and you'll do fine!<br>  oh and aviod dairy that day that makes it harder for you to sing

Different shampoo and conditioner sets will serve you better if you want nice curls, volume, damage repair, color protection, shine, etc. Of course, it is always better to go with salon hair products, even if you might pay twice as much. It's always worth the extra because although you may not be able to tell, many cheap products contain harmful ingredients that more expensive ones do not (some that strip your hair color, dry it out, etc.)|`|Tam4lYMdaa	if you color treat your hair, redken color extend shampoo and conditioner is awesome!! even if your hair isnt colored, this s & c are SUPER moisturizing and will make your hair very healthy :) if your hair is frizzy and dry u can try Redken Smooth Down s&c.

Redness may take a couple of weeks to disappear completely. Clear fluid, sometimes with a yellowish tint, may appear at first but should dry up over the first few days. However, infection can interfere with healing and make the site unusually painful. Here are some signs to look for: <br>  <br>  Increased pain. <br>  Increasing redness. <br>  Warmth greater than that of surrounding skin. <br>  Red streaks coming from the tattoo site. <br>  Pus or cloudy fluid coming from the tattoo area. <br>  A bad odor. <br>  Swollen lymph nodes. <br>  Fever. <br>  Occasionally, the skin on top will heal while a deeper infection forms beneath the tattoo. If the site appears swollen and/or feels painful even though the tattoo itself has healed, there may be a deep infection.

You can learn more about them and order them at www.spanx.com (make sure NOT to spell it with a K because it will take you to an unsavory unrelated website.<br>  <br>  You can find them at these stores: Nordstrom, Bloomingdales, Lane Bryant, Torrid, Chico's, Sak's 5th avenue, and at places like local bridal boutiques.<br>  <br>  My friend let me know they are made to be worn without underwear. Each product has a size chart on the site that will help you find the perfect fit.<br>  <br>  There is also a line called Assets that you can find at Target.

AA11591142	Bigger. It magnifies reflected images.<br>  <br>  Edit: Listen up, people. Simple common sense. A concave mirror reflects light from a focal point, such as your nose when you hold a concave mirror up to your face. You see your nose magnified. A convex mirror reflects a wider field of view than a flat mirror, so objects appear smaller. Because they reflect a wider field of view, convex mirrors are used on the right side of vehicles, and also in warehouses to enable fork lift drivers to see around corners.|`|bc2e83997314aae3b4ddef8f5ff8a553aa	Concave mirror magnifies objects.<br>  Concave lens reduces size of object.|`|4bd7a4416c59a1bde9e95e4e73219626aa	smaller.  convex mirror makes them bigger|`|3818167ac154551351613f47dcd24c42aa	SMALLER|`|c9c23a7a91ba166cb81c18e48b6c9917aa	Blurry and Foggy.|`|cd17eef9e55a780eeffa97bef8154beaaa	smaller. hense the 'cave' in concave. <br>  convex makes the image appear larger.<br>  just think, concave mirrors make things thin and look thin themselves.<br>  convex on the other hand make things look fat and are fat.|`|241053bafb89564156ff15e817d11c13aa	Bigger|`|f38781d6e1069dab538df7701de70140aa	Concave mirrors are shaped like a "cave" and reflect the light back towards you inwards so everything looks smaller.  Conves mirrors to the opposite, so everything looks bigger as if you'd looked through a magnifying glass.
Lmh3ybBTaa	OUCH I would never want to make my hair die. That sounds like it would hurt.|`|154dzJ1Faa	I'm not sure I'd want to get into the shower if you dyed your hair, because it would dye your skin too!  And I hope you didn't really use dye -- that is for fabrics, as you know, and it really doesn't do a good thing for hair.  It also interferes with anything else you do with your hair.  It is very difficult to remove from hair.<br>  <br>  If you want to change your colour, you should use a proper hair colouring product, made especially for hair, that works with your hair structure.  They are easier to work with, and look better.<br>  <br>  When in doubt, always READ and FOLLOW the directions -- that's why they are there.  Some require a short time, others a longer time.  But you need to do what they say for best results.  If you fail to do that, then they do not guarantee results.<br>  <br>  Tints are mixtures of the three primary colours: yellow, red and blue.  The blue is the last colour to develop in your hair, and if you wash it off too soon, you are left with quite orange hair!  It fades the first if not fully developed, and you are left with orange hair!  It's not the fault of the colour product, but impatience.  You need to follow directions!!  Tints exhaust themselves after a certain period of time, once mixed, and they do not get darker if you leave them on longer. You do not get a lighter shade if you take them off sooner.  You need to allow the colour to process for the required amount of time for best results.|`|Ykzx3OVfaa	However long the box says!<br>  You have to read the individual box. Some are 10 minutes, and some are up to 30 minutes or more.<br>  If you don't do what the instructions say, you could get some really damaged hair, an irritated scalp (flaky and red - bleh), or a funky color.|`|jcEtRUVZaa	The full processing time the instructions say.

X2bxkU2paa	I'm assuming you mean in your forearms.  Lean muscle and lack of fat will cause your veins to protrude and become more visible through your skin.  Repetitive arm curls with a dumbbell and using a ravel-bar** are two of the best exercises you can do to accomplish this.<br>  <br>  For your information, women typically find muscular and athletic builds of men attractive, not their veins.  Most women are OK with normal, healthy looking veins that protrude through on a man's arms when he's fit and tone.  But excessive veins are gross, and women typically don't like them.<br>  <br>  **(a bar with a rope attached to the middle of it with a weight on the other end of the rope - you twist your wrists and ravel the rope up until the weight is lifted all the way to the bar, then you unravel it back down to the ground)|`|HHnQyjFBaa	#1 - There is no safe way to do that.<br>  #2 - Why would you want to do that in the first place?

The ones with aluminum chlorhydrate complex are very good.  One brand name to try is Ban.<br>  <br>  I don't think it's necessary to get an expensive razor.  The disposable kind works fine, so long as you really do dispose of it when it starts to get dull.  You can buy a whole little bag of them.  Look for a cover on each razor, so it won't cut anybody when you do throw it away, or tape it  inside an empty toilet paper roll for the same reason.

I'm thinking of something rather close-fitting, with a V neckline, and either a short necklace or a colorful scarf.

The feathers were way more curly than the long part of my hair, and got wicked frizzy despite me throwing every product I own at them, but the under layer looked okay...

You can get it layered, and when you want to wear it in that style, just flat iron it and you can get a similar look.

And it will make your hair so much softer and sleeker.  if you do use conditioner, when your rinsing it out, dont rinse out all of it.  you know when to stop when you can hardly feel any conditioner left in your hair, and when you squeze your hair, just water comes out.  your hair will be wayyyyy softer if you do either of these things... =D|`|GKSlikxJaa	well what you do it you brush you hair real real well it might hurt and it might take a while but then you but it in a ponytail and you leave it you might want to carry a brush around but if you think it might get knotty take a brush but other than that it wont be knotty when you take your hair out<br>  <br>  <br>  Tip: when you take it out take it out slowly and dont put it up bith an rubber band put it up in an elastic|`|ON5xm0Jvaa	detangle spray|`|154dzJ1Faa	There is no reason for tangled hair.  You must be doing something wrong!  ANd you never ever pull so hard that it hurts!!  You never pull on wet hair if you want it to look good!  Horrors!<br>  <br>  You always brush your hair well before a shampoo.  You remove ALL the tangles first.  And Heavens, use a proper shampoo!  They all leave your hair easy to comb, unless you really have damaged it.  You should also use conditioners every time (good ones, not oil or wax), or even use a creme rinse, or make one of your own.  There is no excuse for having tangles.<br>  <br>  You always start combing out your hair (NEVER use a brush!) from the ends.  When the tangles are removed from the last few inches, you move up higher about an inch or two, and take those out right to the ends, and then move up higher still.  It takes time.  Any time you stretch your hair when it is wet, you will break it up inside, and it will hang there dead.  It will have no body, no shape, no bounce.  It will not curl, or straighten.  It will break off easily, or make split ends. Wet hair is more delicate than dry.<br>  <br>  Guys with really long hair that don't know how to look after it should have short hair.  It's easier to look after, always looks neat, and never gets tangled!  You know I'm right.|`|def913262af3ad74da15c66c2614ad09aa	a hair cut!<br>  <br>  getting a trim every 3 months will help keep tangles out of your hair.|`|kGkUG0fKaa	use a wide tooth comb<br>  buy something like a an oil sheen spray or some kind of conditioner spray to use when coming it out<br>  if your hair is really long, comb it in sections and hold the piec eyou are combing. start with a small chunk of hair with the wide tooth comb and comb slowly til you get to the ends. if it tangles, just hold the ends where it is tangled and comb starting from the bottom of tangle, outward, like if you were using a pick|`|liaUiZVgaa	After you condition your hair, comb, not brush, comb your hair.

GZKbvXLLaa	Real UV gel nails are not meant to be worn for a short amount of time, and then removed. Its too bad they didn't explain that to you when you had them done. Anyway, if they are real UV gel nails, they cannot be removed in acetone. They must be filed off. I suggest going to an experienced and highly skilled nail tech to have this done. An unskilled tech can and usually will do much damage to your natural nails. Whatever you do, be sure the tech does not attempt to force them off in any way. This will cause a lot of pain, and it will damage your natural nails. This method is most commonly done in the cheap salons. It is not the way to remove gel or acrylic nails. Neither should be forced, or pried off - ever.|`|lG5Xl7UQaa	well i got them on right now .. had them on for 3 months and when they grow out the ends start to rise and they fall off lol like two fell off i needs them filled! i only pay 28 to get filled but anyways your nail goes very soft when they are removed but it heals quickly .. my mom had them on for like 5 years and she hasn't removed them haha so god only knows how hers are . And you shouldnt have to go get them removed keep picking at them and they will come on just dont strub them on it willl hurt! lol <br>  hope i helped :)|`|V2ROdx72aa	You should soak them in soap and water to get it pretty tender and then soak your fingers in nail polish remover and they should break off pretty easily.|`|sOkTUYq7aa	go back to the nail salon to get them removed.  it's not painfully, but you'll probably have to pay a small amount.
rPFfDR7Laa	it takes lip piercings 4-6 weeks to heal so you should be all set for school to start again.  you can buy a clear labret stud for your piercing called a retainer.  it's not a ring, so your school probably wouldn't even notice.  it would just be a tiny clear dot on your face.  you can take your jewelry out for short periods of time after the 4-6 week healing period, but it will be harder to put the jewelry back in the longer you leave it out.  so to avoid irritation to the fistula (that's what the hole is called) you should leave a retainer in as much as possible rather than taking it out for school. good luck! and that's awesome your dad is okay with it.  my parents are not, but they don't mind my industrial or stretched lobes.  they just don't want me "doing permanent damage to my face."
58e7168731ee00dc31b69607d01a97f8aa	Stop picking at it, your fingers have all sort of bacteria on them that causes infections...especially in the cartilage around the ear..<br>  <br>  It's easy to say to stop touching it but try, use warm soapy water to clean it, scrub it gently and if you can stand it pour a little rubbing alcohol on it twice a day.  Warm the rubbing alcohol by sitting it in warm water first so it wont be so cold..  good luck.|`|JjmEYiDIaa	Go to a doctor and and get some antibiotics.

If thats it turn your pillows upside down every 5 days.  So thats 10 ten days with out washing your pillows.  After these 10 days wash them.<br>  <br>  I was breaking out a lot, i use neutrogena too, and my acne wasn't changing.

154dzJ1Faa	No, no, no...  you got this thing wrong here.<br>  <br>  You cannot "dye" dark hair blonde!  I wish you would learn enough to at least use the right words!<br>  <br>  To get from dark to light, you have to use bleach.  There is no other way, none whatsoever.  You can't even use paint to make it light.  Dye means to make darker, to add more tones and depth of colour.  Dye is used on fabrics, as you know, and really isn't that great on hair.<br>  <br>  So you applied it unevenly and made it uneven.  If you didn't want it like that, then why did you do it that way??!!?  I don't understand this -- if you had done it properly, you would have achieved the correct results.  It's that simple.<br>  <br>  If you have mixed up the bleach mixture, it is no good now.  It only lasts for a short time, and then is exhausted.  You need to mix up a fresh batch IMMEDIATELY before you apply it.  And of course, you need to apply it according to the directions.  If you haven't taken any classes or instruction, you shouldn't be playing around with it.<br>  <br>  I think it would be best that you go to a salon, or a school, and have this corrected.  At least, you would have what you wanted, without all these mistakes.|`|fmeuE91Paa	It's never a good idea to try and dye dark hair blonde. I would say either go to a professional and have them try to get to an even blonde. Or just give up and dye it all brown again (this would be the simplest,fastest, and cheapest way to fix this). Maybe try the second suggestion and just dye it all brown again. Then after a month or two of letting your hair rest and recuperate go to a salon and have them dye it blonde. Good luck!|`|ab164dcaaad15e522a63a627ac66360caa	You shouldn't attempt to fix it today wait a week and take good care of your hair till then a lot of deep conditioners because bleaching and lightening hair does a lot of damage and is hard to correct your self i would advise you to have a professional correct it. Trust me save your self some damage!|`|cQJGaUK4aa	My suggestion is to go to a salon and let the stylist get the effect you want, the  "store bought" hair lightening kits are not  strong enough to take you from dark  brown to blonde, to many shades  there, it's the volume of peroxide that will lift the hair and even 20 volume is not enough...<br>  Good Luck|`|ZH9OIfUXaa	dont dye it again! you will fry and do serious damage to you hair!you should never go from brown to blonde with the doit yourself kit! leave it to a professional i know you want to cahange the color but you will really damage the ends of your hai!|`|Ovn7040naa	the color or bleach has probably reached it's oxidation level so you will either need to buy a new color/bleach or go see a colorist.

AA11387618	okay, i have thick hair as well, and ponytails are like all I do. First, comb your hair back. Then, grab your hair back with your hands as if you were to put half your hair up into a half pony. Then, using one hand to hold your hair there, put your other hand under the rest of your hair at the nape of your neck and push it up to meet the hair you have already pulled back. now, holding all of your hair together, tie it back with a thick, strong hairtye. this is an easy style to maintain. ~|`|027efc9eeab19b924b8fc1183e701a24aa	Well, the way I do it is....lay on my stomach on my bed and put my head over the edge and just pull it together!.! hope it works! if it doesn't email me and i'll find something else|`|AA10745008	i have really thick hair too. and the way i do it is i comb my hair back. then i smooth it out with my fingers to get rid of the bumps. i hold my hair with one hand and use the other hand to put up the hair at the back of my neck. i twirl my hair to get it all together  and then i put a firm hairband to hold it.|`|AA10867693	You need to use some type of wax,applying it at the base of your scalp at least 1" in length throughout your entire head of hair, then starting in the middle(where you want your ponytail to be pulled up to)  began taking section of hair and brush towards the ponytail section with a bristle brush, continue taking 1" sections until you've reached your hair line then smooth that remaining part up towards your established ponytail section in the middle of your head... May sounds complicated but I Promise it works, and your hair strands remains in tact. Good Luck.

But, hair only turns green when you introduce chlorine to bleach, or ash to platinum hair.

Just wear them around the house first to make sure the tissue has shaped to your foot so that it's more comfortable to walk in.<br>  Or you can buy something to fix the problem. A thin insole, heel grips, toe inserts (essentially the same concept as tissue paper) to name a few, will all help the shoe fit tighter on your foot. Any good shoe store will carry these things, and they are very inexpensive.|`|01ef093d3aaa0dd29db791608d7ba010aa	exchange them, or refund them and go to another shop and get a pair that fits you

8ade0db30813886a484ead6a7a7cf0f5aa	As a hairstylist for 30 years I can tell you I hear this a lot.<br>  One reason could be your hair has gotten longer and the weight has pulled the curl down and looks less curly.<br>  <br>  Or you are now in a dry time of year such as Winter.<br>  Humid air will increase curl dry air closes the cuticle and makes it less curly.<br>  <br>  It can happen as well that the hair itself can change in the follicle.<br>  <br>  Now you would ask why? Well a few answers hit a bit on it but not all the way.  Depending on hair type condition and length many things can change and you wouldn't even know it till it has been going on for awhile.<br>  <br>  The real answer would be that it depends on your hair length and type and weather.  Also as the body ages the hair will change.<br>  <br>  To solve this problem as your hairstylist if your hair is too heavy is a haircut going to bring curl back and if not can you use products to renew the curl.<br>  <br>  This is the most logical reasons was your hair naturally curly to start with because when a perm grows out it can look like your curl is going and it does.  Even permed hair will lose it's strength.<br>  <br>  Protein bonds will create curl or straight hair not much you can do to control protein bonds as they come from within the follicle.<br>  <br>  Not seeing your hair all I can give you are these answers I hope that you figure out where you land in my answers.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|341daf560e1389fb74283d66267c236eaa	Well people have different changes in hair it's common<br>  When I was little my hair was curly like curly party stremers.<br>  After a while,my hair turned straight and wavy. <br>  So everyone has different changes.It is normal.|`|ed92e489a1031cb0d55cb9a18203b7eaaa	age. hormones. weather conditions.|`|478597eef4393d0f8227d858fc3ada3eaa	Maybe something you're eating or a hormone in your body.|`|ebf924eda2bea1930ed81157d90d4e0aaa	Be glad you still have hair.

946ac3ce13eb61e8e6cce5cf8cf5d5a1aa	Dry, frizzy hair has been the bane of my existance until I discovered Jessicurl products (hate the name, love the products). Right now the products aren't in many stores. You can check the website, Jessicurl.com to see if any salons in your area carry it, or you can do like the rest of us and buy directly from the site. She does offer sample sizes so you don't have to shell out a lot of money to give it a try.<br>  <br>  Another web site you should check out is naturallycurly.com. It has a BB and product reviews from other curly girls. It's great for weeding out the products from the hype.<br>  <br>  Good luck finding what works for you!|`|14fb9037c53f3eb52956bd31e43797e1aa	Scrunch it Garnier Fructise Style curl gel and mousse and hair spray works like a charm i do it cuz i have frizzy hair and no ppl who have frizzy hair and use it.|`|460ad2eecc6beba975d0c22de6c90076aa	i also have curly hair and i found that i HAVE to use leave in conditioner  and styling products .it took years to find the right one and i really like bed head curls rock amplifier .i wash condition rinse then leave in cond. then the curls rock and then alittle spritz while still wet air dry if it feels crispy just blow dry a little .it sounds like alot of stuff but my hair is frizzy if i dont use all that  .once you get used to it it aint bad alot easier than the flat iron and less damage!!!!!!|`|4bf80b5473375a4e853903b048398281aa	Either have it chemically straightened for a new look,or get a really good haircut|`|62bc02f428a8441888bf77c532f8006faa	in personal experiance, night before wet your hair towel dry it thourughly <(sorry never known how to spell that) brush it through then sleep on it, my hair usually is good enough just to leave in the morning, or if you dont particularly like to sleep on damp hair, buy some shock waves curling moose (or any type really, thats just the one i use) and then tip your head upsidedown and squirt a generous amount in your hand and scruntch it into your hair, hope this helps good luck x x x x|`|ba9af885ad3cd0e160601fd8abc1a275aa	Have you ever tried straitening it?

They should help keep the moisture content of your skin up whil looking natural and providing sheer coverage. After that, apply concealer only where needed. <br>  <br>  Eyeliner can be worn by any age group, but I generally think it's best to wait till you're at least 14 or so. Start out with brown so it looks more natural, keep it light and ask your mom's opinion, she'll tell it to you straight. ;)<br>  <br>  Finally, brown eyes can support any color, from earth tones like brown and olive to purple (which really highlights the brown). I recommend having a taupe or neutral around for most days, and using a "pop color" for special occasions. <br>  <br>  Hope that helped you!|`|272096268665f016bf544e03834fb5b1aa	Bare Minerals is really good.

If price is a factor you can book an appt at the local beauty school for a few bucks more than the over the counter dye with better results. If you are a do-it-yourselfer Go to sallys. The ladies (and guys) working in there are licenced cosmetogist. Tell them what you want to do and they will show your what to buy to do it and how to do it. I am not sure what color your hair is now but I would suggest buying some Quick Blue lightner from sallys and let the ladies help you decide what volune of devloper to buy base on the color your hair is now and the color you desire.

zCWcoFhZaa	Hi its a funny thing with black hair dye and the roots showing, even if its a dark brown most of the black is sill in your hair. Most likely if you tried to say bleach or prelighten it out you will get an orangey result, or end up with lighter roots than the rest of the hair and it could be patchy. <br>  I dyed the underneath of my hair black once and it was a night mare to get out, I was putting light browns on and they just wouldnt cover the black. So I decided to prelighten it out as its not as bad as bleacing it from staight off as I have done in the past and the hair just gets wrecked. But when I tried to put a dye on the deep orange colour after the black was prelightend it just went a dark auburn colour and looked worse still. <br>  <br>  As you roots are though and they are blonde no matter what colour unless you go black wil make you roots a total lighter colour than all the rest. <br>  If you went to the hair dressers they would probably strip out the colour and redye it but then you dont knoe if they will do it properly and how much more it will cost you if they mess it up.<br>  <br>  <br>  If I was you I would just let your roots come through and not put any dye on and let it grow out keep getting cuts so it doesnt seem to take that long to grow it out as the hair grows faster. Then once all your natural hair is out you can go whatever colour you would like.|`|7fI3ZV6Naa	im having the same problem. i dyed mine black and its faded to dark brown, but its only been about 3 weeks. i went to a salon cause i wanted to get it lightened to light brown but they couldnt do it. they said to let the color fade out more and come back in a month and they could do it then. if its been several months for you i would say its ok, but you might want to ask a professional just in case, because everyones hair is different.|`|Pi25zJ1maa	A cosmetologist can remove the rest of the color.  Then get some blond highlights while the rest grows in.|`|fKSvElOcaa	I don't recomend you to dye your hair a lighter color because the color will only stick to your roots. I had to wait about a year and a half to re-dye my black hair to a lighter color and it was partly because my hair grows extremely fast. If you wish to go lighter you should start off with highlights.|`|nBGHgSN0aa	the dark part will stay dark and your roots will take the colour youre putting on. Unfortunately to get  a unison colour, the existing one will have to be lifted(bleached up) and then the colour deposited on it. You cant just dye lighter even if you use a high lift colour, it will only lift a shade or so.

Some redness, small spots or bumps are normal and should subside within a few hours. A cool, damp towel may be applied to the skin, especially on the bikini line and upper lip or for persistent irritation. Apply sunscreen to areas that will be exposed after waxing. and For the least amount of redness after waxing, apply calming lotion, using a light circular motion and tap with fingertips.

If you want to do a major dye job I would suggest doing it in steps. For example, if you have blond hair and wish to dye it brown, don't automatically dye it brown, do a dirty blond then a light brown, eventually a medium brown, and keep working your way up the color you want. <br>  <br>  Wait a week or two before re-dying it if you're doing a major dye job.

IeBC9GLnaa	serum, and blow dry it smooth before straighteneing!! xx|`|e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	-  Wear it curly!  Read the book and visit the sites below about curly hair. I did and my once horrible curly hair is now virtually frizz-free ringlets. Now I get compliments on my hair all the time! Straighten your hair- be happy for a day, learn to manage your curly hair- be happy for life! <br>   - To style your hair using the curly-girl method you will need gel, a leave in cream, and conditioner at the minimum. Some less useful, but still nice stuff would be a blowdryer, a diffuser (reduces frizz in curly/wavy hair when used with dryer), and a microfiber hair turban (to dry wet hair while sleeping or in the morning).<br>   -The main philosophy of the curly-girl method is to not use shampoo. This may sound unhygenic but it has actually made my hair less oily and dandruffy. Most shampoos contain some of the same chemicals found in laundry detergent (sodium laureth sulfate, sodum lauryl sulfate, ammonium laureth sulfate, ammonium lauryl sulfate, etc.). They dry out curly hair. Also you shouldn't brush your curly hair dry because it damages the hair and makes it poof. <br>   - Massaging of the scalp with conditioner to remove dirt is all that is needed. It will clean everything but super clingy silicones (cyclopentasiloxane and dimethicone are examples). Then rinse and spread conditioner on the outside layer of hair and the hair at the nape of your neck. Gently comb tangles out with your fingers or a wide toothed comb and rinse with cold/cool water. <br>  - Do not brush/comb your hair after this point because it wil disturb the curl pattern (make sure you already have a part). It is also important to use gel on sopping wet hair and scrunch the hair with your fingers. Make sure gel is evenly distributed everywhere in your hair.  If you use too much you can always scrunch out the crunchy texture later. <br>  - Use paper towels or an old t-shirt  to gently scrunch some of the water out (generic towels can make hair frizz).  You can either let your hair air dry or wait ten minutes and then use a blowdryer with a diffuser. Dry until your hair is almost dry, and then let air dry the last bit.  Do not touch the hair while it is air drying or it will frizz!  <br>   - Use a moisturizing conditioner, such as Desert Essence Organics Italian Red Grape Conditioner (found at health food/organic stores) or Activate Hydrating Conditioner (drugstore). The combo of products that I use daily is L'Oreal Out of Bed Weightless Texturizer (comes in a black-colored tub) and then Herbal Essences Totally Twisted Gel  or Body Envy Gel, but there are more conditioners, gels, etc. on the websites. The products I recommended are my personal favorites and contain no silicones or drying alcohols.<br>   -   Your hair may seem worse at first, but it is just adjusting. This may take a couple weeks to begin working.  Before you decide to quit shampoo, do a final cleanse with shampoo and stop the use of any products with silicones in them.

vdEzgiC4aa	Tú piel? con hidratación y exfoliación. Es sencillo pero requiere constancía, te paso lo que yo hago. Todos los días antes de meterte a ba?ar date un masaje rápido con un guante de crin o un cepillo de cerdas naturales, no es necesario que sea vigoroso, por que puedes lastimarte. Despues, durante el ba?o, no uses agua demasiado caliente, lo mejor es la tibia, talla con un zacate o cepillo de ba?o firme las areas difíciles, como los codos, rodillas, pies, tobillos. Cuando ′quita el exceso de agua y con la toalla talla un poco todo tu cuerpo para que termines de secarte. Ya seca ponte la crema inmediatamente para que la absorvas mejor, escoje una que valla con tu tipo de piel (seca, grasa, mixta, reafirmante, etc.) Una vez a la seman has una exfoliación más profunda. Despues del cepillado (para retirar celulas muertas) con un jabón exfoliante liquido (lo encuentras en cualquier super, me gusta el de dial por que además huele muy rico y si quieres lo puedes usar todos los días) pon un poco de sal en grano. Con la piel humeda pero sin agua en exceso, talla por todo tu cuerpo esta mezcla, procura que sientas los granos de sal, que son los que estan quitando las impuresas. Enjuagate bien y sigue con el resto de la rutina. Es importante que no te lastimes la piel, puede quedar un poco enrrojecida pero no te debe molestar, si ago te lastima deja de hacerlo inmediatamente.|`|58401df3a96c4ac06b0b29b0c0a71d46aa	cuando te ba?es frota te con azúcar todo el cuerpo es un excelente y barato método para exfoliar la piel.

Todo depende de si quieres que parezcan mas grandes, mas peque?os, mas altos, mas profundos, dependiendo de como lo quieras existen ciertas formas de maquillarse para lograrlo, pero para resaltar el color cualquiera vale, pero si quieres un consejo utiliza ***** para la parte inferior del parpado, para la part media un azul claro; que tambien debes ponertelo en la parte de abajo del ojo, y para la parte superior del parpado utiliza un blanco difuminado o un dorado difuminado. Eso resalta la mayoria de los ojos.|`|IWoCZh5uaa	Hola, Si quieres lograr un efecto natural y muy luminoso, utiliza sombras en tonos neutros sobre la gama de los beige, topos, tierra y marrones. Si buscas un efecto contraste y más elaborado aplícate sombras rosas, malvas, violetas, y si te atreves incluso color ciruela. Busca siempre tonos complementarios tanto en las sombras como en el lápiz delineador, para que se fundan bien cuando los difumines. Huye de los naranjas y los rojos. <br>  En cuanto al lápiz, evita la raya interna en azul o verde agua, salvo que tengas unos ojos enormes; queda mejor en un tono blanco o rosáceo para así agrandar el ojo. <br>  Muy importante: aplica base de maquillaje antes de las sombras y no te olvides ni de las pesta?as ni de las cejas.|`|PiSxLm1Laa	lo ideal es resaltarlos con delineador *****, tambien para k te resalten viste con ropa azul.|`|TXrbFPg4aa	hola creo que usar poco maquillaje te ayuda para que el centro de atencion sean tus ojos y usando bastante rimel pero no vayas a exagerar puedes acompanar el rimel con un poco de lapiz para ojos en un tono cafe. tus ojos llaman mas la atencion cuando no los maquillas mucho ademas se ven super chic y enamoraras a mas de uno!!!|`|0c9c5306e2e0592efdec25504785c7b4aa	Los producto Almay tienen la linea Bring Out the Blue y Play Out Collection, especial para resaltar los ojos azules, consta de estuche con un trio de sombras, lapiz delineadores y mascara, de venta por separado.

Para que sepas sacarle siempre el máximo partido apunta estos consejos:<br>  <br>  La forma de los ojos<br>  <br>  Para conseguir una mirada más profunda tu aliada será la sombra de ojos:<br>  <br>  Para ojos hundidos: Usa una sombra de ojos clara o un corrector en el párpado. Esto te dará apariencia de un párpado más ligero. <br>  Para ojos caídos: Lo mejor es una sombra entre media y oscura. Dibuja una línea de color desde la línea de las pesta?as hacia las cejas. Extiéndela con una brocha suave a lo largo de la línea de las cejas y hacia el puente de la nariz. Acaba con un poco de sombra de ojos clara en el rabillo del ojo para abrirlos un poco más. <br>  Para ojos prominentes: Debes extender un tono gris o marrón suave en las zonas en las que la luz se refleja más. Se trata de crear una sombra artificial. <br>  Para ojos peque?os: Extiende el perfilador o la sombra alrededor del ojo. Así se hará más grande. Una sombra de ojos clara o un corrector entre las pesta?as exteriores los abrirá. <br>  <br>  El color de los ojos<br>  <br>  Ojos claros: Si tienes los ojos azules lo que mejor te puede combinar es un tono gris, malva o rosa. Para conseguir un toque diferente, te puedes aplicar una línea violeta debajo de las pesta?as inferiores. <br>  Ojos oscuros: Quedan muy seductores con tonos naturales como marrones, ******, almendra y melocotón. Para una piel madura, evita sombras oscuras que destacan la textura de la piel. Un color más claro será más favorecedor. <br>  Las pesta?as<br>  <br>  Si deseas tener una mirada profunda y seductora, el último paso durante el maquillaje será conseguir unas largas e intensas pesta?as. Con una mascara para pesta?as dotada de un cepillo de filamentos termoplásticos que se diferencia de los tradicionales al ser mucho más flexible y cubrir uniformemente las pesta?as de la raíz a la punta, llegando a las pesta?as más próximas al lagrimal.<br>  <br>  El resultado, la máscara aporta volumen, definición y separación que asegura que los ojos estén totalmente enmarcados|`|LSoUDfcRaa	mira ponle un delineador ***** y pintate con sombras azules obscuras te recomiendo que uses 2 tonos te aseguro que tendras una mirada hermosa|`|d2daecd648410d6a8f05cb9fa39b460faa	Pudes pasarte un lila suave que te de brillo o una sombra nacarada blanca.<br>  Saludos y suerte|`|1luR7wNkaa	Sombra blanca bastante difuminada en la zona alta del párpado (entre el párpado y la ceja). Después, para la zona del párpado, con unos ojos claros, puedes usar desde azules, lilas, verdes, marrones y beige. Creo que para noche, te irían muy bien los marrones, con un lápiz de ojos marrón, no muy oscuro o eyeliner si sólo te pintas la raya en el párpado superior. <br>  Para las sombras claras, tienes gamas de lápiceros de colores claros, que pueden destacarse en la sombra que lleves dada... Los hay en azul, lila, blanco... Una raya blanca, también puede resaltar bastante el color de tus ojos.<br>  Yo soy más partidaria de todas las gamas de color tierra... y del uso de perfiladores en marrón... Pero todo depende de la fisiología de tu cara, y del estilo que tengas de vestir.<br>  Un saludo|`|57b70db30847a1f76effd4bfd75c542baa	Los ojos azules son muy bonitos, por si solos ellos se resaltan, pero si usas sombras en tonos claros y te haces la linea de abajo obscura los vas a resaltar mas.  Suerte.|`|I7Ip3T3Gaa	Para que resalten unos ojos claros la sombra debe ser oscura para que haya contraste de color, si no se te van a ver muy apagados.<br>  Si no quieres tonos muy oscuros utiliza tonos medios, un color violeta te sentara muy bien.<br>  Tambien puedes probar a utilizar un poco de rimel ***** y un poco de sombra marron o beige, o en algun tono dorado.<br>  De esta forma se te vera maquillada pero no tanto como si te pintas con sombras mas oscuras.|`|NqXmzfIQaa	recuerda que los ojos se maquillan dependiendo es estilo de ojos que tu tengan .dicen que son azules pero pueda que sean grandes de pesta?as muy largas o muy peque?os .asi que lo mejor que te recomiendo es ir adonde venden los maquillajes y consultarle auna de las maquillistas ellaas te pueden haser resaltar tu lindos ojos azules de la mejor manera .suerte|`|d7qRirdwaa	Como tienes los ojos azules te quedaría muy bonita una raya azul lo más similar al color de tu ojo, aunque la negra le dara más intensidad a tu mirada; pero como buscas un tono más natural un tono rosa o marrón suave es lo más natural|`|f6973d96f94837a24e9bb959bace6a10aa	yo tengo ojos claros, siempre usé colores tierra de sombra y rimel y delineador *****, es lo q mas resalta.|`|hssFTjjUaa	si es pregunta para chicas, conteste solo para llegar al tercer nivel disculpa si. espero tengas solucion a tu problema. <br>  suerte. y dios te bendiga.|`|x3Z2CMGvaa	para resaltarlos, alrededor de ellos ponle sombra o lapiz deliniador oscuro, un ***** o un azul, celeste...algo ke kombine con tu pelo....  o un rosado, ese resalta igual

dQ6asVI5aa	If you are considering a drastic change, you are best to go to a professional.  When you go lighter, there is more than one step to it and it will require a color technician.  Going to the local drug store to do it yourself is NOT a good idea.  When you color your hair and make it lighter, that is a permanent color.  Semi-permanent colors or hennas only coat the hair.  They do not lift color lighter etc.  If you do decide to go a lot lighter, you will have to go to a professional every 6 weeks for touchups.  There is no possibility of doing this on your own unless you are a professional.  Seriously consider the cost of doing this as without touchups, it won't look so nice.  If you need any more assistance with this, let me know.|`|vbVzoD1Qaa	In my professional opinion you should just maintain what you got before that you liked.  YOU should not do anything.  But if you want a change, go back to the salon that did the job you liked.  The benefit of the highlights as opposed to all over light is of course that all over light grows out with a very hard line.  Highlights grow out too, but the line is softer.  <br>  <br>  You can not lighten your hair with a blond semi perm type of color.  Period.  Please save yourself the heartache- head to the salon.|`|jQHzRWZQaa	You should go to a salon and get your hair highlited with brown base and yellow clean strikes. If you do it by yourself it will not be as clean as others. It would stink to have bad highlites you didn't want. So let a professional do it. PLEASE.<br>  ( I think blonde would be cute becase its almost summer)|`|AA11694375	light brown to blonde isn't too much of a color difference. You could go and get it done at a salon. I personally do my own hair. Just make sure you get enough dye to color all of your hair. If it's longer than shoulder length, you may need two or more bottles.I haven't personally ever used a semipermanent color so I can't say anything on that. IF it's a pretty good color difference, you will have to touch up the roots every 3 weeks or so. They do sell touch up kits so you don't have to do the whole head of hair over and over. IF you're still having some trouble, get a friend that is experienced with dyeing her hair and make a party out of it! Have fun and enjoy being blonde! :)|`|RMhEe1m2aa	right...first of all it depends on just how dark your brown hair is basically only use l'oreal bleach if its not very dark, if you do this youll need to start applying the bleach from the ends of the hair and try and have the black touching your scalp for the smallest amount of time possible as it is very strong and will begin to itch if its on for too long, but if youve very dark hair use jerome russel, youll need to buy 2 packs and bleach it once then wash then bleach again and it should be very blonde to almost white :) i hope that helped

leGd5ZcQaa	Go to a Beauty Supply store---Here in the area where I live we have, for example "Sally's"----for hairdressers---but is open to the public.     REMEMBER this:   If using a hook to pull thru cap...pull small stands----otherwise she will NOT not like the  results.  One time my sister did MINE  ---she pulled too large of pieces thru and it was hideous!!!!!!<br>  Make sure you rub a piece with paper towel---  always look at stands pulled first--then those pulled last -----rather look for white ----or she will end up with "orangey" UGLY highlights!!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck.

It'll make your eyes stand out more and won't look like you have too much on! For the night life you can make a small line on top and bottom of your eyes and use black or navy blue mascara! Always go for the "dramatic" look at night!! You'll look awesome!

I thought that I was the only person that had ever had this happen! I have natural dirty blonde hair also, but over last summer I tried to go blonder also. When I went to a back to school party people kept staring at me. I didn't know why! But finally people started to come up to me and tell me that my hair was like orange & red. I had some people tell me it was strawberry blonde. Eventually (about 2-3 weeks later) it wore off! But it was soooooooooo embarassing.|`|nAwLPHHNaa	OK- what u need to do is go to a salon. tell them what has happened..have them tone it for you...most likely they will do this by depositing a cool toner shade with a blue base.<br>  THEN buy yourself some special shampoo (silver brights) or the equivalent..(ask your stylist).. don't be alarmed it comes out purple...|`|LErZpLmuaa	if you are using sun-in then you just need to keep using it. it will eventually come out you just need to strip more of the pigment out of your hair|`|Wv0bIBgyaa	OMG!! thats wat happened to me. i tried everything to get it out!! i just left it alone, and it went away. dont worry it will fade away, and u might have some cute hightlights. u should go to a hair salon and they will know how to get it the correct shade of blonde. good luck
JrnXCy49aa	No, my sister did that, it didn't lighten her hair all that much, but also didn't damage it.|`|kQOWiYbvaa	No it's good for your hair, unlike shampoo, conditioner, dye, hairdryers, perms, etc. It'll defrizz your hair and lighten it.|`|566JFfOwaa	It wont damage it, it only lightens it slightly but it can turn orange if you use it too much...|`|NFnhP7O5aa	My mom did this to my hair about once a week every week during the summer when I was younger.

(sorry)..but you should try somethin else...and try usin the new secret clinical strength..youll still sweat but it helps u stay dry|`|VxE46bSFaa	I used to have that too. If normal antiperspirents don't work, try something like Certain Dri Roll-On Antiperspirant. It costs about $5 and can be found at most drugstores. It completely stops the sweating. It is prescription strength, but you don't need a prescription for it. It doesn't have a scent though, so you might have to get a normal stick for a scent.|`|B7JziKqOaa	If I'm wearing a white shirt I usually apply Stainstick to the underarm area immediately after I've worn it.  It seems to help get the discoloration out.  For white shirts you can also use a bleach pen.  As for deodorant, I like Certaindry which is clinical strength.  You apply it at night and then apply a deodorant in the morning since Certaindry is only an antiperspirant.|`|QFriFbkwaa	eeewww!!!! but i will answer this as best as possible...ok???<br>  yes i was watching this trya banks show and their is thing called botoxs but it costed waaaaayyyyy ttttoooo much and u had to do more that once to help the sweat go away. sssoooo some one had asked how can it stop and the answer was wear girl secret deoderant their was a certain kind with olay in it wich stopped it i'm not sure is it will help but it is worth trying.|`|wkI9X4Hiaa	it is usually deoderant that causes stains on shirts, salt crystals work pretty well and dont stain. you can get them at most stores now for men and women

2e6b63593deee4333c524ac68cf22a52aa	This is so frustrating.  Five years ago when I weighed 100 lbs, I was wearing a size 3.  Now, at 108 lbs, size 0 pants are falling off me.  Surely women are wondering how they are 20 lbs heavier, but two sizes smaller.  Most size 0's are too big for me now, I've tried the kids sections, but the pants aren't cut right.  It's just catering to the majority (larger) population.  If you're from the US like me, over half the population is overweight.  I guess if I was overweight I would rather buy a dress that says 10 rather than one that says 14.  I'm trying desperately to gain weight, for the mean time I've mostly given up on shopping.|`|24cfb9540386b800bb43a544c412b806aa	Bloom beat me to it. I feel sorry for the women who are dumb enough to be falling for this--and they must be out there, or else the fashion industry wouldn't do it. Personally, I am just irritated when I can't figure out what size is mine, which happens all too often.|`|1c9b7ea62dd1c5ff92da5fae6dda8089aa	size inflation is a huge problem, particularly in the U.S. There is no more uniform size. i wear a 6 in levi's jeans and then a 10 in delia's jeans. in the EU, clothing comes in standard sizes. i think the US should adopt a similar program.|`|uEL0pkN4aa	I've seen a couple of articles on this.

3bnCY0nlaa	well im 5'8" and i've noticed that the length of shirts doesnt really change depending on size. a medium is the same length as a small, its just wider. just buy shirts that are meant for layering so they are a little longer|`|Emo8KkJmaa	Okay, don't worry hun i understand. I'm 5"9, 130 lbs, and size 7 long in Hollister jeans. It's back to school for me as well and I would say go for the medium. Reasons why: smaller shirts can be unflattering and show stomach creases and bulges. If you go a size up, it will flatter your waist line and elongate your torso to make you look a lot slimmer. If you are having trouble with jean sizes, also go one size up. You want your jeans to last a long time and if you accidentally shrink them in the wash then you wasted your money. Clothes will last longer if they fit you and even if you're still growing it's okay, but don't try and pull off an outfit that obviously doesn't work. I'm sure it fits but to be on the safe side just go with the medium and then layer your tops for a cute and comfortable look. xo Claire|`|rUEcND3uaa	yes because sexy lady|`|vbsXonOqaa	i had the same problem. first go to the store and try things on, you dont have to buy them there order them online after you tryed it on if you liked. or get a tape measure (u may need some1 to help!!) and look at the wesites size chart make sure you get everything right! good luck and member..<br>  <br>  ~me 4 best answer! plz! haha~|`|zKXz8ea9aa	You should really try them on.

fyjeoKXoaa	My suggestion is a polo or rugby style shirt (three button) with jeans that start at the waist, and not below.  <br>  <br>  Or, you can opt for the "school uniform" items that they mention. Everyone else will be wearing them too, so don't worry about looking odd. <br>  <br>  This also makes getting dressed in the mornings easy, as you already know what to wear.<br>  <br>  My son needed school uniforms or similar for the last few years, and we went through the whole thing ourselves.<br>  <br>  Short sleeved collared shirts and beige or blue pants for boys, and skirt and short sleeved collared shirt ; or jumper and shirt for girls.<br>  <br>  If you have any friends going to the same school, ask them or their moms what they will be wearing. Makes it much easier!|`|Up8sBpFMaa	wow<br>  don't limit yourself to Kohls...|`|c25bb4eeb8a23121abdbb64a43909abcaa	Here you go.<br>  It is a blue striped polo from forever 21 and a black skirt from the same place that looks long enough.

It hurts like crazy, but it will last much longer than shaving, wont give you annoying stubble as it grows back, and the hair will grow back thinner.<br>  <br>  <br>  ?Tiffany-Maria*|`|cYqaxwEHaa	It doesn't hurt for me. Apply shaving creme to make it less harsh? And if your just starting thats why it will hurt a little. but not that bad, suck it up and once your body gets use to it, it wont hurt anymore. Beauty is pain.
bjR7Xf55aa	Hola,  que gusto da que te preocupes por darle una hermosa apariencia tu cabello, las puntas abiertas y la resequedad del mismo pueden originarse a varios factores, por ello voy a darte  mis mejores consejos.<br>  En cuanto a vitaminas la vitamina E y B5 son las mas recomendadas. Puedes tomarlas y tambien puedes encontrar shapoos naturales que estan altamente consentrados en estas vitaminas y puedes encontrarlos en tiendas de autoservisio y naturales . Los que yo te recomiendo mas son:<br>  Radical y Keravis, si no encuentras estas marcas,  solo lee la etiqueta y busca en los ingredientes estas principales vitaminas. No olvides la keratina que favorece al colageno de los foliculos capilares, que aunque no lo creas son lo mas importante de nuestro cabello ya que desde ahi sabremos si nacera un cabello sano o deteriorado.<br>  Lo que  a mi me fuciona muchisimo es un bano de crema, las hay especiales para cabello maltratado y con orzuela, puedes encontrar unos hasta para danos severos. Humedece tu cabello y unta la crema  en todo el cabello siendo aun mas generoza en las puntas. Toma una toalla y mojala en agua tibia, y colocatela en la cabeza, espera media hora y  ahora si a banarte. Veras que tu cabello lucira muy mejorado. <br>  No utilizes cepillos de cerdas duras y plasticas ya que estos quiebran facilmente las puntas.Por un buen tiempo olvidate por completo, de fijadores y gomas para cabello (gel). Utiliza en lo mas minimo secadoras, rizadores  y  (o) planchas.<br>  Para sellar las puntas, cuando este seco sin rastro de humedad, coloca, silica o pomadas eso hara que tu cabello luzca brillante y nutrido.<br>  (Todo esto lo encuentras en tiendas de autoservicio en el area de shapoos y cuidados para el cabello).<br>  Suerte y a sorprender al mundo con un hermoso cabello!!|`|29d60ca2a0defed35288358b44e20106aa	Vitamina E<br>  y para la piel Vitamina A|`|8PPj3gIHaa	compra uno de esos champoos que anuncian en la tv, la verdad es que hay algunos que si sirven solo faltaria investigar cual te sirve  a ti|`|9373c1dac020c30fca6acf36ded6192eaa	hola!el cabello seco es genetico pero puedes tenerlo hidratado con algunas suegerencias:debes ingerir vitaminas del grupo b en forma oral,o sea comprimidos y si no puedes tomar levadura de cerveza que contiene muchas vitaminas del grupo b.<br>  por otro lado,debes usar champu y acondicionador para cabello seco,cortar las puntas cada 2 meses,evitar el uso del secador o planchita<br>  para las puntas vienen muchos productos que ayudan a mejorar la textura <br>  tambien debes hacerte una nutricion con calor,ya veras es excelente!!!<br>  de forma casera puedes usar unas gotas,solo unas gotas de aceite de almendras en las puntas con el cabello aun humeda,queda muy bien<br>  bueno,suerte!!!!|`|ZTqxR3F2aa	usa un shampu k diga puntas abiertas te rrecomiendo el pantene<br>  o un champu de chocolate

Además como paso de las modas y me compro lo que me gusta no tengo ningún problema...jeje.<br>  El que sea de marca o no me da igual, pq muchas veces me ha salido la ropa con la misma calidad que la del mercadillo, la verdad, y es vergonzoso porque es la misma ropa que el a?o anterior o unos meses atrás era carísima.<br>  Pero bueno, a veces en tan barata que compensa y siempre tienen algo nuevo...|`|hCgTGDR8aa	yo he comprado en outlet stores, solo ten cuidado pq en veces la ropa tiene pequenos defectos, pero algunos no muy notables.

e0d4c76eb9999423dcbfbc25a8799fb0aa	Para nada es cierto. Piensa que aunque estés morena, te tienes que continuar proteginédote de las radiaciones ultravioletas....<br>  <br>  Tienes que escoger una buena protección solar, nunca inferior a 8.<br>  <br>  Te recomiendo que visites esta web de los farmacéuticos. Dan muy buenos consejos sobre cómo tomar el sol. además de explicar perfectamente qué significa el factor de protección solar, tipos de radiaciones solares, etc...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.farmaceuticonline.com/cast/familia/familia_solar_c.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.farmaceuticonline.com/cast/fa...</a><br>  <br>  Zettagirl: también te recomiendo visitar el link, y verás qué pasa si no usas protección solar. Cuando seas mayor parecerás una pasa, eso si no tienes cáncer de piel antes claro!|`|13SmwojPaa	Si no estas bronceada y tomas mucho el sol sin proteccion te pondras roja. <br>  Si estas bronceada  y tomas mucho el sol estarás mas protegida, pero probablemente te saldrán manchas oscuras.  Lo ideal (si eres de piel clarita) es empezar a tomar el sol con una proteccion 30-40, e ir bajando a medida k pasen los dias, 20,15,10,8...|`|38d15e59f6e415df2b58853a3c6120edaa	Mentira!!!! tu cuerpo necesita proteccion contra los rayos solares todo el tiempo, el sol envia rayos ultravioleta (UV) y estos no los podemos ver las personas pero alli estan y el hecho de que tu piel este bronceada significa que eres inmune, al contrario la piel estara bronceada por estar expuesta al sol, es por eso que al ir a la playa o alberca, es preferible usar por separado un bronceador y un bloqueador solar (el bloqueador entre mas alto sea el nivel de proteccion te dejara menos bronceada pero es mejor que nada)|`|5W8H4pbwaa	No es cierto. Aunque yo nunca uso proteccion solar. Saludos!|`|8qPdLQQpaa	FALSO, siempre debes protegerte de sol.|`|p2AUQvgfaa	No, siempre se necesita proteger la piel de las radiaciones solares.|`|tVj734vZaa	no, no es cierto, aunque estes bonceada tienes que proteger tu piel del sol, por que la exposicion a este es malisima.<br>  El cuerpo tiene memoria y con el tiempo todo el sol que tomes sin proteccion puede salir produciendo melanomas (cancer de piel) protegete del sol siempre.<br>  Mas vale prevenir que curar<br>  <br>  ciaooooooo|`|eONkYaSlaa	noo, siempre tienes que protegerte y mas aun si estas bronceada, ya que el da?o es acumulativo y si te bronceas mucho, a largo plazo puedes tener cancer a la piel.|`|4de40a68eba60cecb966607ed9f31ab1aa	Siempre que te expongas al sol necesitas protección,la piel es delicada y debes cuidarla si cuando seas mayor la quieres tersa y bonita|`|6d258125cf3b7b831452b4805422903aaa	No, porque debio ponerse primero proteccion solar y luego broncearse.|`|cdbdb4a010c68faf0c2334a3aade0a1aaa	...falso...|`|fc3707ecf13fdf5658899ce637422ea9aa	Siempre se necesita proteccion, aunque si es verdad que dicen que entre la piel sea mas morena, resiste mas del sol.<br>  <br>  Saludos :)|`|9ECddamQaa	la gente de color tmb se pone proteccion sola y no por que sean muy morenos no se van a quemar aunque estes bronceada tienes ese riesgo no dejes de ponerte la proteccion solar que luego puedes tener cancer de piel|`|IRFrfTxMaa	Por supuesto que NO es cierto, aunque estes bronceada debes usar un protector solar para bloquear los rayos ultravioleta y que asi no le hagan da?o a tu piel, nunca dejes de usarlo, aunque no vayas a la playa, los rayos solares osn muy da?inos y a la larga provocan cancer y envejecimiento prematuro....|`|NfB8CPZvaa	no. La protección solar no es para que no te broncees si no para que no te da?en los rayos del sol.

Por eso la piel necesita de protectores que la mantengan hidratada, y protegida.|`|m8rqjdQOaa	Mentira|`|xf2tSdXCaa	noo por mas que estes bronceada los rayos solares te siguen afectando la piel, siempre se tiene que usar proteccion!

A friend of mine bought me some Ambi bleach cream and the lines and spots gradually disappeared. It works great on light people and dark people. There is also an Ambi soap u can use to cleanse with.

LA2GWBPHaa	Waxing is better for the upper lip because it hurts less, gets all the hair out, takes less time, and lasts longer than threading.<br>  No, threading nor waxing will leave a white patch behind. That is only left behind from hair removal creams or bleaching.<br>  Threading will get the hair to grow back darker and way thicker. Waxing will get the hair to grow less and less often.<br>  Threading will last about a week.

Waxing is convenient cuz you only have to worry about it once a month.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps your friend!|`|1z9ogUuEaa	threading is the best. it does hurt, but its worth it. and it won't be white. about once a month is fine. if your older, twice a month. it'll grow back normally.|`|e1a6eec6c5c157761693aa3b09da1523aa	1.

Don't worry, you're not alone. Millions of people from all around the world suffer from dry, brittle and weak hair. Some of the possible reasons for falling hair are: <br>  <br>  <br>  Tension <br>  Too much work <br>  Illness <br>  Poor diet <br>  Over-exposure to the sun <br>  Perming <br>  Amateur bleaching <br>  Too frequent and inexpert use of tints, rinses or other colourants <br>  <br>  <br>  Here is what you can do to prevent hair fall <br>  <br>  <br>  Shampoo regularly. Remember, a CLEAN scalp is a HEALTHY SCALP. <br>  <br>  Brahmi amla oil also promotes hair growth. <br>  <br>  A high protein diet with plenty of fruits, green vegetables and dairy products is a must. <br>  <br>  Drink 10-12 glass of water everyday. <br>  <br>  Use a very mild shampoo and condition your hair at least twice a week. When you do, make sure you rinse out the conditioner thoroughly, otherwise residue build-up will cause your hair to look limp and dull. <br>  <br>  Know your vitamins! IRON is important for healthy hair and brittle, limp hair indicates an iron deficiency. Spinach has a good iron content, so gulp it down! <br>  <br>  ZINC helps prevent hair loss and greying. Eat adequate zinc rich foods. Overweight people tend to have zinc deficiency, which is inversely related to the body mass index. Thus if you are overweight and if your hair falls too much, you may want to increase your intake of zinc containing foods. Recipes containing stone ground, wholegrain flour are rich in zinc. <br>  <br>  A shortfall in VITAMIN B may cause dandruff, falling hair, loss of colour and could encourage grey hair. So B group Vitamins are essential for gloss, colour and thickness. <br>  <br>  VITAMIN C ensures the health of capillaries supplying blood to hair follicles. Make sure your diet includes plenty of fresh fruits and veggies. <br>  <br>  VITAMIN E encourages hair growth. Switch from refined flours to wholemeal and wheatgerm, eggs, vegetable oil. <br>  <br>  COPPER stops hair from falling. Studies show that the copper content in the blood serum of people with falling hair is less than normal. Different types of alopecia (falling hair) are seen to have a deficiency of this important trace element. Include small quantities of nuts, especially cashews and peanuts, seeds, whole milk and beans in your diet as these contain minute but important amounts of copper. <br>  <br>  <br>  Homemade remedies for preventing hair fall: <br>  <br>  Apply almond oil on scalp and massage. <br>  Grind fenugreek seeds in water and apply on your scalp. Wash off after 40 minutes. Do this every morning for a month ?V if it suits you! Remember, different treatments suit different types of hair. <br>  Massage warm castor oil + almond oil into your scalp gently. Wrap a hot towel around your scalp so it gets absorbed into the hair. Do this twice a week for healthy, shiny hair. <br>  Add 2-3 drops of honey to a glass of water and use this as the last rinse after shampooing. <br>  <br>  <br>  Quick Hair Care Conditioner <br>  <br>  Mix 1 egg, 2 tbs castor oil, 1 tsp vinegar and 1 tsp glycerine. Beat until frothy and massage lightly into your scalp. Wrap your head in a hot towel, steam, then wash off. This conditioner makes hair thicker, shiny, soft and manageable. <br>  <br>  <br>  Honey Conditioner <br>  <br>  Beat 1-2 eggs (depending on the length of the hair), 1 tsp honey and 2 tsp olive oil. Massage gently into the scalp. Steam, and shampoo after an hour. <br>  <br>  <br>  Alcohol Conditioner <br>  <br>  Beat 1-2 eggs with 2 tsp brandy. Massage into your scalp. Leave for 10-15 mins. Rinse well. The egg nourishes your hair and brandy stimulates hair growth. <br>  <br>  Your hair is a vital beauty asset, requiring constant loving care. And with a little nurturing, lush, glossy hair will be yours<br>  <br>  ESSENTIALS FOR FALLING HAIR - <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Does your hair fall often Arm yourself with these tools to combat hair fall. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Wide-toothed comb <br>  <br>  <br>  Get yourself a wide-toothed comb. This is probably one of the most important yet underutilized of all hair tools. A wide-toothed comb helps you distribute conditioner evenly all over your hair while shampooing and conditioning. In addition, it also helps get rid of knots smoothly.<br>  <br>  The best time to get rid of knots is during conditioning. Apply conditioner and run a wide toothed comb gently through your hair.<br>  <br>  While untangling dry hair, do so in sections. Take one section at a time, and first, untangle the ends of your hair. Do so slowly, and don?t pull unless you want your hair to fall out in clumps or break.<br>  <br>  Don?t wait for the last minute before detangling your hair. Every night, while sitting in front of the television, run a wide toothed comb gently through your hair, until you have untangled it completely. Do this every night, and you will notice that your hair remains free from tangles.<br>  <br>  Leave-in conditioner <br>  Dry hair tends to tangle easily, and, needless to say, causes it to break. Make sure your hair is never devoid of moisture by always keeping a bottle of leave-in conditioner handy. The next time you feel your hair is dry and rough to the touch, simply rub a dollop of leave-in conditioner between your palms, and apply it to your hair. Comb through with your wide toothed comb. Your hair will be instantly rejuvenated and moisturized. Gradually, the texture will also improve. This is a must if you blow dry your hair regularly, or if it is chemically treated. Such hair constantly craves moisture, so get yourself a bottle of leave-in conditioner.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oil <br>  Olive, almond and coconut oils are all excellent for the hair. While you could apply oil as an alternative to leave-in conditioner, oil tends to make your hair sticky, and you cannot style your hair well after applying oil. Your only alternative would then be to tie up your hair. For better results with oil, apply just a few drops immediately after washing your hair, when your hair is still dripping wet. Oil doesn?t penetrate the strands as easily as leave-in conditioner does though. Nothing beats a hot oil massage followed by a steam treatment, as the steam helps the oil penetrate the hair strands, strengthening them and curtailing hair fall.<br>  <br>  <br>  Egg <br>  Egg is great for the hair ? there are no two ways about it! True, it causes a tremendous stink in the bathroom, and your hair may let off an ?eggy? smell, but the results are instantaneous and worth it! Egg strengthens your hair almost immediately, and the egg yolk leaves your hair shining. Whip an egg with two tablespoons of olive oil and apply it to your hair. Wash off after half an hour. Make sure you wash off with cold water though, or the egg will start cooking in your hair, and would be harder to take off! Use a scented shampoo to counter the smell of egg in your hair, and follow up with a leave-in conditioner. Do this for a month, and you will be amazed by the change in your hair texture and the reduction in hair fall.|`|YxjktxLbaa	you apply coconut in the night.  next morning apply yoghurt on your hairand leave it for half an hour or untill it is dry then wash it off.  It really makes your hair very shiny and soft.  I hope you live in India this way you can make yoghutrt from fresh milk.  Here in US it did not work for me because it is pasteurised|`|cAJPBIJraa	try amino acids at your nearest heath food store!
AA12072376	There are MANY things you could try. All of these work fairly well. Whatever you can get your hands on really.<br>  <br>  Ice<br>  Bikini Zone Cream<br>  Tea Tree Oil    <GREAT for bumps<br>  Aloe Vera       (like the after sun stuff- you may have some at home)<br>  Rubbing Alcohol     <Last resort (it will sting)<br>  Neosporn<br>  Deoderant (sounds crazy but I hear it works)<br>  Benzoyl Peroxide (or really any acne medication)<br>  Moisturizer (preferably one with aloe and vitamin E)<br>  Salacylic Acid (sp.) <This stuff works great because i helps renew cells<br>  Antibacterial Soap<br>  Exfoliating Cream (but DONT scrub hard)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Make sure to wear loose fitting underwear. (and maybe sleep without any for a while because you really need to let the area breathe)<br>  <br>  Use a loofa to rub gently over the area w/o soap, just warm water, lightly and then use COLD water to zap the pores shut<br>  <br>  Don't touch the area too much.<br>  <br>  Wait it out. With these tips you should be good in no time! Best of luck and I hope they heal soon! Bikini bumps, razor burn, ingrown hairs and all that comes with waxing and shaving are terrible. Since you waxed and didn't shave I'm guessing your bumps will be gone in 24-48 hours and quicker if you use the info.

c2b02e9ecd23f132f51e1510e98b8b8faa	apply lemon juice|`|GYFYUMffaa	I've had problem skin growing up. It sucked because no matter the brand of cleansers and washes I bought at the store, they NEVER helped (Neutrogena, Clearasil, Clean and Clear, Proactiv and even higher end stuff that cost $30-$75). I used to have red spots all over my face that were from previous pimples and even when my skin was clear my skin still looked like crap because it looked like I still had acne. Until I found Alpha Hydrox on drugstore.com! I swear by this regimen! I can guarantee you'll see results with these products and they're all on drugstore.com. Use this regimen once a day (AT NIGHT ONLY) and within a week you'll see change. I felt so helpless with my skin until these products. I will note that I've tried these products without the others and I didn't get results, so it's important that if you do try this system of mine you buy/use each product.<br>  <br>  <br>  ?Alpha Hydrox Nourishing Cleanser (this will shrink your pores in a week and blackheads are less noticeable), Biore's Triple Action Astringent (I love this stuff. It's the only toner that's ever helped my skin), Alpha Hydrox Fade Cream (this will make your skin really red for a little bit after applying it, but it will go away. It might even sting/burn slightly for a couple minutes after each application but that will go away within a few days and it's totally normal), and end it with an oil-free moisterizer WITH SPF. Alpha Hydrox has some that's good and so does Biore. The active ingredient in the Fade Cream WILL make your skin sensitive to sunlight so you have to use a moisturizer that has SPF or your face will turn red when you go outside. The Fade Cream is $11 but lasts at least 2 months. Remember, once a night and it's not recommended that you use the Fade Cream in the morning. I know this is long but I know how you feel and I really think you'd benefit from this stuff. Good luck!

wnnudNp5aa	Take it to your local dry cleaner and ask if they can get it back to silver. I have seen the dry cleaner work miracles with some of my things! I'm pretty sure that will solve your problem! <br>  If that doesn't work, you could try hand-washing it with Woolite (or dishwashing liquid) and lukewarm water. This might make it wrinkly, but if you're careful, you could probably iron or steam the wrinkles out. If that doesn't work, my last best idea is carpet and upholstery cleaner and/or spot remover. I have no guarantees on what this will do, so you might want to try it in an inconspicuous spot first.<br>  If all these methods fail, your only hope is to take it to a place that dyes satin shoes (some formal and bridal shops do, or they will certainly know who does!), and have it dyed. It shouldn't cost very much and should solve the problem. That might be your best bet after dry-cleaning, if you don't want to take any chances with home remedies! Good luck!<br>  Let me know what works for future reference! Thanks!|`|fbcU9xUAaa	Surgical spirit takes out discolouration. Just apply with sponge and let dry|`|jiE5iKIyaa	Can you dye satin?

I have naturally wavy hair and it enhanced my waves, gave me more of them, and gave me that back from the beach look. I went out the next day and bought some. You can get it at salons.

W87k9v34aa	it works awesome i'm a make up artist and when i do photo shots and stuff i put clear mascara in their eyebrows to keep them in place, some times i even put dark colors just to darken their brows, really it does work@|`|8858ea7544e1102468af6a6b1faabd25aa	Yes, I have used it before and it looks and feels very natural. <br>  <br>  If you're looking for one, I would suggest you get one from E.L.F. It's only one dollar and you can use one side for your eyebrows and the other side for your eyelashes.|`|AA11712061	NO NO NO!!!...<br>  stop and put the mascara down....<br>  dont put clear mascara on your eyebrows<br>  <br>  you know how you put mascara on your eyeLASHES and it makes it have the wet or clumpy look...yea...um..thats exactly what it is gonna look like...<br>  <br>  for my advice wet and shape..with a eyelashes/eyebrow brush.<br>  [=<br>  <br>  <br>  <3 Jessica|`|c25bb4eeb8a23121abdbb64a43909abcaa	it does not look like anything. so i guess you could. it is clear.|`|OAr2RXNvaa	id imagine it would be all sticky and gross looking...try wetting your eyebrows to set them...then take a toothbrush or eyebrow comb and spray it with hairspray and comb your brows down...ive been doing it for a couple months now after reading it in a magazine because my eyebrows are long and curly and can be all over the place...works wonders give it a try.|`|XBv0a0Zbaa	I have used like a special eyebrow mascara type thing.  All that it does is help emphasize your brows.  If you put on to much it looks like they have been gelled like old men hair.  So just watch it.  But I always would dampen my finger and rub over top my brows, to make it look much more natural.  But yeah, clear mascara will work to settle your eyebrows.|`|H3agEoBBaa	I've heard you can and I even bought some brow wax stuff, but I think that it would feel sticky and look wet/oily.|`|cegcGjQWaa	i do it..there is a slight tingling sensation but it doesn't hurt..may i suggest using a toothbrush and water...
uZe15gmOaa	Try DENIM THERAPY. They can repair your jeans for you and return them in a few weeks, but it's $7 an inch! You better be in love with those jeans!|`|0997885582bff396d2ba0dd5979c1626aa	can't you buy a new pair, same brand and style?|`|0qy3yYTmaa	Wow you really  did poke about in there. And it true they are a great fit. Let's see you can use a large motif starting Freon half way up your knee down to your calf.. No use trying to sew it up - it;ll show. You need a trendy embroidered motif to cover most of that leg. And  maybe the same for the other side to even things out. Or a different one as you prefer. i was going to suggest you tear the other knee till I saw the pics. I have  two or three pairs with motifs all down the leg and they look great.<br>  <br>  Now where to get the motif - I'm pretty sure there are shops or even stores which sell haberdashery. Do you know someone who can sew because they probably would know where to find these items.|`|UslrX3Kaaa	why do u want to fix it...it is the natural order of jeans to ripe eventually.....i suspect if you do fix it....it will not look good|`|flHmevCyaa	Well normally I would tell you to sew a patch over it, but its one the knee so I don't think it would be very comfy.  But its worth a shot!!  Good Luck!!|`|lIkbmV1kaa	umm well u could like put a patch under it of your favorite colors. or you could have someone sew it back for you. like maybe family or something. or if there is an embrodery place near you could ask them wat they can do to fix it...|`|fytRkuuhaa	Probably not, unless you find some denim and use it as a patch, they look kind of cool though with the hole, you might want to leave it that way instead of taking the chance of ruining them<br>  Good luck :)|`|lGyhKhv2aa	Um. Just leave it? I dont know ripped jeans are the fashion. You just made your own 60 dollar jeans feel proud!

Women have been much quicker to adopt practical clothing men use and have in fact raided the entire side of the men's wardrobe and have gotten away with it (Boxers, pants, jeans, boots, etc etc). <br>  <br>  Skirts are MORE practical for men than women if you stop to think about it :-  A mini skirt can easily take the place of shorts this hot summer... anyone have a problem with that? Kilts ARE skirts by definition but are expensive thus not very popular. With a little encouragement from the women skirts could be the key to break decades of boring boring fashion for males (they have only pants or shorts). Women have many options and this is one of the few garments men and easily adopt can reclaim. Nothing gay about it when worn with other male clothing. (Clothing doesn't make you gay so please don't use that to attack the guys). <br>  <br>  Watch out...polls show most women are fine with guys in skirts. Know any women that didn't go crazy over Brad Pitt in Troy? It takes a real man to wear a skirt before they are vogue...|`|XIBPEQ7laa	well it might have been a kilt. you never know. but if he wants to wear a skirt then let him wear a skirt. it isnt hurting anyone.

He also says to see a hair stylist monthly and to buy the best hair care products from a salon or a beauty supply store.|`|wOfPAEsFaa	The only cure for split ends is a trim.There is no way to repair the split because the ends of the hair are dead.The best way to prevent split ends is to get regular trims,use a good shampoo and always condition your hair.Do not rip tangles out,use a wide tooth comb to work out tangles.Don't tie your hair up too tight.Eat right,drink lots of water...your hair,nails and skin are a reflection of your over all health.

kRXNBwwHaa	Technically, nothing can prevent a person from becoming bald. Baldness happens when the hair follicle starts to thin or fall out of the skin. These things are usually not preventable and are passed through genes. <br>  <br>  I don't know if peroxide works (since it is just basically water with bubbles, like seltzer only you can't drink it) and with that said, I don't think so.|`|5fPqMPrvaa	No.|`|X0BrFsfSaa	It should just keep using it so don't stop because you don't want to go bald

PQXiXEZKaa	Conch or Rookk <br>  <br>  <br>  they are so much more origional and amazing looking :)<br>  <br>  google them they are great piercings.|`|RkgFw9Kpaa	definitely not.  Any piercing should be approached with care and thought.  Most people turn out disappointed with unplanned piercings.  You should know what you want for a couple of weeks before getting it, and you should consider it daily to make sure that it is definitely the piercing you want.  Decide what to get tomorrow and then wait about a month.  Make sure you check out the artists other work before choosing your artist also.  Make sure he uses safe and clean practices and talk to people to make sure that (s)he has a good reputation.  Check out his or her portfolio, and if you get the opportunity, talk to the piercer.  Make sure they are comfortable doing the piercing you like.  Make sure that your anatomy is compatible with the piercing (the ear surface area is different on everyone, and some people have less surface area to pierce in some areas, or thicker cartilage making piercing difficult. Good luck with whatever you decide to do.|`|tFSKpXGNaa	Yes :o)<br>  <br>  Get one on your ear rim, or tragus like you originally stated... cool !|`|JQC7o2J4aa	do what my gilly did went to prison and she got numbers tattooed on her there quite cute|`|0ef851000b538b263ac2c3058c608291aa	go for the nipples, both of them, looks awesome. but you might need more money. |`|J1stiMioaa	most piercings would cost more than ￡16 (average approx ￡25), why tomorrow? tragus hurts! i had 3 genital piercings in 1 go and i would rather have all of them done again than have my tragus done again!
7906ca32c7dc97ed9fdf40b123608e86aa	Plum/purple always look good with hazel eyes. I know because I have them LOL. Try M.A.C.

They have been #1 in Skin Care and Color Cosmetics for the last 14 years in a row. I tried them back in February 2008 and have been using it since. I wouldn’t exchange it for any other brand. They are quality to the fullest and they will even send a Beauty Consultant to YOU. They will teach you how to do it and you can try it before you buy it. You should check them out!|`|9nqgFP3Haa	ALMAY HAS ALL COLORS. WHO CARES WHAT'S IN, AS LONG AS YOU LIKE THE WAY IT LOOKS. YOU CAN GET IT AT WAL-MART|`|1bb92a5334f919a0ab27539b8256b8f5aa	Yes plum is very in this fall.  Not neccessarily in make-up, but I think it would look great with hazel eyes.  Just don't pick a color that is too deep b/c then it may look too heavy on you.  Go for a lavendar-plum and that should work out great.

JABmGMJjaa	go get them waxed closer to your holiday not now is my advice. normally people rebook 5 weeks later depending on how long it takes for there hairs to grow back some peoples grown faster than others remember they have to be long enough  for the wax to grip hold of so dont go shaving them befor you have them waxed. you may get what is called chicken leg which is just red dots on your legs but this will go down after an hour or so its just where there hair is taken from the root. <br>  i wax peoples legs alot im a beauty therapist|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	near holiday|`|wrCjfKdraa	do them on the 17th, nighttime. :)|`|h9kXo1HFaa	well that depends on your skin type if it's sensitive then wax then as soon as posible i'f it's dry wax you legs 2 3 days before your trip and if your skin type is nun of these and is normal you could wax your legs any time you want hair will not grow till 20 25 days. Hey you can also use veet hair remover it's no hurt and no pain. you can remove hair in just 5 to 10 mins only.|`|sKgm3dmkaa	Near the holidays so they'll stay smooth over the holidays :D|`|4dd433ffd713ff4b504195c5e67e8f15aa	wait|`|LbSRpWjmaa	u should wait.that way ur beautyful long legs will be smooth like a baby skin thru ur holiday|`|lHlFi0rwaa	yes. u shud wait. do it just before the holiday.

They have been #1 in Skin Care and Color Cosmetics for the last 14 years in a row. I tried them back in February 2008 and have been using it since. I wouldn’t exchange it for any other brand. They are quality to the fullest and they will even send a Beauty Consultant to YOU. They will teach you how to do it and you can try it before you buy it. You should check them out!|`|9nqgFP3Haa	IT CAN LEAVE YOUR SKIN FEELING HEAVY AND OILY. TOO EXPENSIVE FOR THE QUALITY. TRY ALMAY OR BARE ESSENTIALS
GbKxWlsWaa	I would book a day at the spa for you and her (pedicure/manicure; no facials) and also have your makeup done while your at it. Do some research into the spa, and find a makeup artist who has a diploma/degree, this way she gets her makeup done by a true professional. Have the makeup artist offer her opinions on your daughters eyeliner, and I'm sure she will say the same thing as you have been. Young women are less likely to argue with a professional, and they will probably take their advice in turn.<br>  Best of luck.|`|5L1njRNQaa	I say get her the Cover Girl outlast eyeliner. It lasts all day so she won't have to re-apply all day.  <br>  <br>  Then next time she wears A LOT and wants to flaunt it in front you.  Just tell she looks adorable. And leave it at that.  I'm sure you remember teenage girls want to look hot and sexy.  Not saying they want to have sex, but they want to look really good.  Adorable is not how they want to look.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|x8DmIjejaa	lol that ones easy my best advice is too just leave it but if not then you could give her some crap eyeliner and then ask why she's not wearing it or you could ask some one to tell her that she has an eye infecton and that if she wears eyeline it could seriously damage here sight or eventually turn her blind :) good luck|`|MzbZewb5aa	Theere really is no way unless you lock it up but she will hate you for that. I went through that fad and my mother tried to convince me not to wear it all the time but it never worked. She will wear it weather you like it or not! |`|LFdAuJlOaa	Show her how pretty a star or a model looks in the lighter way of eye liner, and tell her how gorgeous it is, or how its the new look.<br>  <br>  <br>  tell her how bad it looks, maybe that way she might notice.<br>  |`|9nqgFP3Haa	I'm with beautifuldiversity. Do your eyes the same way. Tell her if she doesn't lighten up on it, you'll be going out in public with her like that. When she says "no way" remind her that you feel the same way.|`|fPvK5Vjxaa	I would just try telling her again. But don't make it in  a mean way. I would rather my mom tell me to go lighter on eyeliner other than a boy. Or maybe you can talk to her friends about it. |`|G6yg6DPkaa	Tell her natural looks much more better than panda eyes.<br>  <br>  Tell her what people think of big black eyes and if shes trying to get a boys attention they much prefer a little amount of makeup! as that is true.|`|nzJD0xabaa	Try doing your eyes like that too and seeing how she reacts|`|ykP7I3caaa	yeah i went through that. im 16 now and i got over it . i just thought i looked good.. my mom tried to do my makeup for me and im sure now that it must have looked good but i just wasnt convinced. i thought i looked bad without it. just let this one play its self out. <br>  <br>  it also depends if s he's going for an emo look or a super sexy look. i thought i looked super sexy when i was in 7th and 8th grade and wore a ton. if she wants to be emo or 'scene' then thats just the style. <br>  <br>  dont make her think you dont approve of it. if she wants to wear it she wants to wear it. just tell her how nice she looks when she doesnt wear it. dont say oh you look so good without eyeliner on, just say you look really good today. and thats all. as her sometime if you can do her makeup before school and she'll probably get compliments on it. <br>  <br>  i also like the idea of  you doing yours like that and seeing how she reacts. i think that would work haha even go out in public with her.|`|ZuQUU50Gaa	just be honest|`|BtiZd7OAaa	I don't know , get people's opinions, and print it out and give it to her?. <br>  <br>  But honestly, if your daughter doesn't care about other people's opinions about how she looks, that's a good thing. It's probably just a phase..maybe. Or just take pictures of her, and show her how they look. and see if she likes how she looks. Sometimes people are unaware that they look terrible, If she still likes it..well Idk, just let her do it.|`|oy1bdedEaa	Show her pictures of hookers with their makeup like that and tell her thats what she looks like and if thats the reputation she wants. Oh and refuse to buy her more eyeliner, tell her you'll buy her some every ___ months and stick to it|`|ivZnw7KVaa	Tell her that if she uses it everyday her eyes won't look good anymore and her eyes will age faster. Because eyeliner can do some serious damage to your eyes and she will be forced to wear it everyday whether she likes it or not.|`|Z3NxpPL0aa	Pay the boy that she likes to tell her she looks ugly.
744368c4b8e408245a2cd2b9e2b34434aa	It depends on the look you want. To stay natural, wash it every two weeks and condition it. Once a month give it a deep conditioning treatment and/or hot oil treatment. Keep the ends clipped( the hair has to be DRY AND STRAIGHT--hot comb ran through before cutting).<br>  A texturizer can be applied to the hair if you want to keep the natural look, it will make the hair easier to comb and manage, it loosens the curls a bit. And if you choose at a later time that you want to go straight with a relaxer, you can apply a relaxer without cutting the texturizer out of the hair. <br>  <br>  If you want it straight you can get it pressed(hot comb) or you can put in a relaxer. What a lot of people don't realize is that ADULT relaxers put a lot of strain on the hair and makes it weak, an alternative is to use a kids relaxer(yes even if you are an adult...its ok) it straightens the hair so its manageable not to the point where its weak and breaks. Keep in mind that once a relaxer is applied it is a continuous process(every 3months) a touch-up is needed.|`|Hd5lvhqvaa	It all depends on the texture of your hair. Some people, like me, have tight curls, but it is easy to press and flat iron. In my opinion, if you're not the all natural type, then put some heat to it. Just make sure that you grease and condition regularly.

OvuMI50Maa	i suggest going with ingredients that are found at home: <br>  1) mix 1tsp honey w/ 2 tbsp olive oil then beat in 1 egg yolk. massage on hair in small sections, warp head with shower cap for 30min, rinse and shampoo.  <br>     or<br>  2) massage hair with warm avocado or olive oil, warp hair securely in a towel, leave oil on hair for about 8 hours, or over night. (if left over night but a shower cap, so it wont stain ur pillow)  wash hair, then rince with a vinegar/watersolution. <br>  <br>  ofcourse do this after cutting ur ends. so ur hair can grow, healthier.|`|6Tx8Opmraa	No offence, But don't use any Over the counter product cause theirs ingredinents that can hurt Chemically treated hair, and will build up in your hair.<br>  A Daily Conditioner just pretty much coats the hair and smoothes it down, Where a Deep Conditioner holds more protein and is healthier for your hair.<br>  <br>  Any professional Salon usually carries a Professional Deep Conditioner that they can recomend for your hair.|`|744368c4b8e408245a2cd2b9e2b34434aa	Ok, i hate to be the one that tells you this but.....nothing repairs split ends, nothing! the only way to get rid of then is to cut them off. Split ends are caused by the hair(ends) being dry, over-worked(hair dryers, curling irons, continuous brushing, washing...etc). Anything that stresses the hair pretty much can cause split-ends.<br>  <br>  Deep conditioners are used as treatment to restore the hairs natural oils. Depending on the condition of the hair is how you decide how often you need a deep conditioner. A lot of people use it to maintain and retain the oils and moisture in the hair. <br>  <br>  The difference between the two (daily and deep)....think of it this way; you wash your face every day and moisturize it(daily conditioner) and once a month you get a facial(deep moisturizer). Thats a simple way to explain it w/o getting a long drawn out summurization.|`|34DeSCpRaa	Deep conditioning does wonders for hair. But not only do you have to deep condition your hair for a difference in split ends, you also have to keep your ends clipped or they will split even worse and then you'll have to chop your hair off and start over to get healthy results....Me personally, I use Silk Elements products and I love the results....However , you have to try one and stick with it for a couple of weeks to start seeing a difference. Don't expect overnight miracles. The daily conditioner is mild enough to use everyday on some hair textures, but at the same time they will make your hair weak and easy for breakage which only adds to the split ends problem....Deep conditioning penetrates every strand of hair down to the root which is usually more beneficial in the long run. Also try a hot oil treatment after the deep conditioning. It helps with the repairing process as well. Good Luck!!!|`|36jdJCmaaa	Well in my experience leaving on any conditioner over night has the same effect if not better than those deep treatment conditions.. right now i have washed my hair with pantene ice shine and ive left on the conditioner, put a plastic bag over my head and a towel and will sleep like this till morn! lol then rinse off and style my hair as usual.. i did this last week and omg my hair was so soft i couldnt stop touching it so much in fact my friend asked me if i had knits!! lol it really does work.. why wouldnt it, its a good old soaking and our hairs just like a sponge! and obviously if its well nourished it wont become brittle and break so easily.. like a plant!.. do it tonight and u will see :) <br>  <br>  p.s i tried olive oil.. load of ssshhhh lol|`|9xazEhiXaa	-Herbal Essences Long and Strong.<br>  -You can also get a split end hot oil treatment form any drugstore.<br>  <br>  please answer mine<br>  <a href="http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080502182440AArvvDZ&pa=FYd1D2bwHTHzJLNhE.0zSVZJSGaKFm_E6.OAA0We_31NxQ--&paid=asked&msgr_status=">http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>

Gem?? der Mayo-Klinik ist ein BMI-Wert zwischen 18,5 und 24,9 am gesündesten. Personen mit einem BMI zwischen 25 und 29,9 gelten als übergewichtig. Ab einem BMI von 30 und mehr ist jemand fettleibig. Was sagt die Tabelle über unseren BMI? Vielleicht w?re es ja angebracht, den Hausarzt um Rat zu fragen oder ihn zu bitten, sich zu unserem Gewicht zu ?u?ern.<br>    Um den BMI zu berechnen teilt man sein Gewicht in Kilogramm durch die K?rpergr??e in Metern; das Resultat teilt man dann nochmals durch die Gr??e in Metern.

7tjKIhu3aa	You can start by changing something use most likely use everyday.... SOAP.<br>  <br>  Try to use natural handmade glycerin soap (bar) over cheap commercial brands. I personally use Lifeworks handmade Soaps. Here is the reason why:<br>  <br>  Glycerin<br>  <br>  One of the most important differences between handmade soap and commercial soap is Glycerin, a humectant, meaning it attracts and holds moisture to your skin. Glycerin is a natural by-product of the soap making process, and while commercial manufacturers remove the glycerin for use in their more profitable lotions and creams, Lifeworks handmade soap retains glycerin in each and every bar.<br>  <br>  Oils<br>  <br>  While most commercial soaps contain animal fats to keep production costs low, Lifeworks soaps do not. Our soap is made from high quality vegetable oils along with other exotic oil blends. We don't and never will use any animal by products in the makings of our soap. Not only for the love of animals, but also for the dignity of our customers skin. Who wants to bath themselves in lard? <br>  <br>  Chemicals<br>  <br>  After the use of cheap animal fats, and extracting all the glycerin out, commercial soaps are forced to fill in the gaps with chemicals. Cleansers, detergents, stabilizers, and other harsh additives. Detergents are great for dishes and clothes, not for your skin. These chemicals and the lack of glycerin mean that the soap often irritates, drys, and wrinkles people's skin or causes allergic reactions.<br>  <br>  I find Lifeworks soap to be relitively cheap considering they last 5 times longer then a regular commercial bar, and they also contain glycerin. So you save more money by not having to buy expensive lotions and creams to fix the damage commercial soap causes in the first place.|`|AA12371168	? did you have a baby about 3 yrs ago.. sometimes it will cause a rash to appear. you may want to try a moisturizer for sensitive skin. might have to try several brands to find one that will calm the rash.<br>  <br>  you can see a dr about it. i tried but they only gave me prescrip for rmore money that didnt work..  have had the problem for 15+ yrs now..|`|L0SC0YrTaa	yeah sounds to me like you legs are really dry!! just moisturize everyday, Before i go to bed i usually don't rub the moisturizer in properly so its still a bit moist, i put my pants on and jump straight into bed.. do this for a while and you'll see a big difference in your legs!! it should help heaps. Rub moisturizer into your legs straight after you shave aswell|`|l2nFkbNhaa	I think you should see a dermatologist.. I had more or less the same problem. I think you should moisturize daily with an odorless moisturizer like (cetaphil) its really good for sensitive skin and helps with the itch. also use oatmeal soap and shave instead of upwards, shave downwards ( with the hair ). If it still itches use calamine lotion ( it's pink ) and it stops the itching immediately. good luck!!!|`|Z2NLFBOFaa	Uh, don't use soap when you shave. Use shaving cream. A good thick one. Make sure your legs are DRENCHED before you apply it and then shave slowly and carefully. Make sure the blade of your razer is really sharp. Try to get a razer with those moisturizing gel tabs on the head of it. The more, the better. Then, after shaving, wash off your legs and apply baby oil. Then, towel dry and try some moisturizer if necessary.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped. :)! x|`|sqEI9H5Saa	It sounds like you have dry skin.  You should always use a moisturizer after you shave.  Since you have sensitive skin try something made without dyes or perfumes or something specifically for sensitive skin.  This should help with the itchiness.

You will get one small tube in any ayurvedic shop...at present i am not getting that name.. but if you go and ask in any ayurvedic shop they will give its hardly of Rs.40/- Rs. 60 or so... just apply that ointment while going to bed at night before sleep.. after washing your legs or any infected portion where its itchy... <br>  <br>   I am sure ... you will come out soon hardly by 15 days if you follow this correctly.. <br>  <br>  All the best.. take care
