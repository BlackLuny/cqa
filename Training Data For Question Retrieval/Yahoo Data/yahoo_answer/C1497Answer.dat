8O4ttgGMaa	me and my friends all picked funny resolutions one year.    I'm a horrible dancer, so mine was to crump dance (the dancing seen in Rize) at least one time, everyday, for 365 days. it didn't matter how long, I just had to do it to music. and I sucessfully did it. and I'm WAY better at it now.     my friend stopped drinking soda for a year and followed through with it    and my other friend decided to not eat oranges for a year, anything like orange soda, orange chicken, she didn't have. and she followed through with it too.    I think because we all picked silly ones, it was easier to go through with      and also, we chose them for eachother, we all sorta picked things that the other wasn't good at.
wR1XyyrUaa	Yes, Knowing facts is equally important to understanding concepts.    You can understand the concept, but if there are no facts to support it, it is only hypothetical. Likewise, you can know the facts, but not understand the concept, you can not understand the implications    You can know the concept that Europe is less religious than the US, but when you see the percentages (about 55% in Europe to 80% in the US) you can clearly see that there is a large difference, and the facts are supporting the ideas|`|H7L66ynJaa	Facts speak for themselves ideass and concepts do not.|`|Uj9cLwbpaa	No, but it comes in handy.|`|c85dfb73b5d99dcbc373b5a788901bc7aa	No.    Facts are not useful unless you can use your intelligence to apply them. You can know many facts and still be a very stupid and ineffective person. But if you understand ideas and concepts, you can apply them to new situations. This is what separates intelligent life from, say, cucumbers and hamsters.|`|WhUV9k6Jaa	No, our mind is capable of much more than simply functioning as a database.  The ability to connect ideas, imagine possiblities, and conceptualize are all examples of more sophisticated levels of intelligence.|`|fqLo4HvKaa	You cannot really understand or judge a concept unless you know and understand the facts.|`|mBLT51tiaa	yes because,,,  you have to understand it first.  you may get the concept but if you dont understand   wat is being said or taught whats the point,,,,|`|boaCjBUQaa	Was this an SAT essay topic?? jw....    Knowing the facts is probably just as important as understanding the ideas and concepts because if you know the facts, and you don't understand the concepts, how can you understand the facts? Then again if you know the ideas and concepts, but you don't have any real information or evidence (facts) to base your ideas on, then you are just making false accusations....
n6nSjHXBaa	Certainly countries like France and Russia have small monarchist movements, but I doubt that they will succeeding in bringing about a change to a monarchy any time soon.    There are, however, certain European countries where the monarchist movement is much stronger.  These include: Serbia and Georgia.      In Serbia, for example, there are some monarchist political parties that have actually won a considerable number of seats in parliament, such as the Serbian Democratic Renewal Movement, and the Serbian Renewal Movement, who had a combined total of nearly 10% of the seats in parliament.  Serbia also has a very vocal and popular Royal Family who are never far from the national consciousness.  Also, in addition to the monarchist political parties, there are several non-political monarchist associations that enjoy considerable support, such as the King's Youth.    Georgia also has a very vocal monarchist movement.  As with Serbia, a significant number of seats of parliament are occupied by monarchist parties.  Also, recently, the monarchy debate was reopened when the head of the Georgian Orthodox Church issued a call for Constitutional Monarchy to be re-established, amid the 2007 political crisis.    It should be noted that there have been cases in recent times where monarchy has been reintroduced successfully in a European country.  The best example of this would have to be Spain, which became a monarchy in the late 1970's.|`|O8qyhAegaa	No.   The New World Order will be a truly global empire of human enslavement with the antichrist as the sole leader.  There will probably be a type of feudal system utilized the entire 7 years.|`|bda465ikaa	Serbian monarchy is the strongest candidate. I would say no chance for Italy, Greece, Romania, Russia, or even Germany.   --------  Partly Serbia because the royal family are all American citizens now. I think Serbia would perceive it as a good way to bring American tourists to the country.|`|gPvOcB6oaa	Very unlikely, If the EU have there way Europe will become a federal state with no place for monarchies, the only ex royals who have campaigned for a return of the monarchy is ex king Constantine of Greece and although he makes regular visits back to his homeland the people of Greece have made it clear to him and his family they do not want a return of a monarchy in Greece|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Possibly.  Some of the deposed monarchs of Eastern Europe still have descendants.  And there has been a small movement from time to time to restore a couple of them...one hears rumblings.  But it's not super likely, either.      Spain DID restore theirs in 1975.  So it isn't impossible.|`|qcflj3umaa	I don't think the Romanovs Bourbons, Hapsburgs, Hohenzollern, or any other monarchies returning to their former power any time soon. Putting that aside, I agree that Monarchies should be restored as a Constitutional Monarchy. I as a HUGE fan of the Romanovs would probably move to Russia if they were restored (or at least go to the coronation and coronation balls.) I hope someday that the world returns to the way it was in the 1700s with powdered wigs, and Royalty being formal, even in the presence of their own families.|`|lGKq9NXbaa	I highly doubt Russia will go back to a monarchy.

And having a monarch with no power for "national pride" or for the purpose of tourism is too expensive.|`|AA12005609	Rumors continue to fly in Royalist circles that Rory Emerald, Baron of Sligo, will assume the tzar's throne in Russia. His great aunt, Duchess Maria of Sevastopol, bequeathed much of the imperial Russian jewel collection to him and Putin is eager to convert it to cash. The other rumor is that Putin wants to stand on the jewel boxes to increase his stature. Whatever Putin's motivation might be, look for our Rory to renounce his British title and pack his skis.|`|0SoVa5braa	No, monarchy is a regressive form of development, it can't function in new economical conditions effectively. Totalitarianism or authoritarianism are possible but not monarchy. And believe me there is no monarchy supporters in Russia maybe several crazy people.

bf4cc388616ba9cb48357f54373c609eaa	My ideal woman has matured through the years along with me. The field grew more narrow as the years passed because I realized how much understanding and acceptance my ideal woman would need. In the past twenty or  so years the field narrowed itself down to just one woman because I have grown to be so particular and choosy. I am so fortunate to still be married to my Sweetie because she is the ideal woman in my mind and in my heart. She fills the bill.|`|Uzzv4FYZaa	She is smart, self-possessed, dependable, and cute as heck.  Not much change, except she's cuter.|`|8G42oyydaa	Pbviously I am not  a man but where I live all the men in their 50's and 60's are chasing the decorative 20 somethings and seem to be willing to pay to look foolish and spend all their money on them.  Whenever I went anywhere with my daughter they never even glanced at me, but they were leering at her.  She thought it was disgusting, but then she has principles and would never "sell" herself to a sugar daddy.    Browsed classified in other cities and dont see the ones you do here, that read " 67 year old man, look and feel 30, wanting to meet women between the age of 19 and 28 for good times, romance"|`|EVnlDpPUaa	She hasn't, sweetheart i,m pleased to say.|`|Ti0q1Btiaa	Well, jany,  I'm old enough to be your grandfather, maybe great GF.    I lost my first two wives at a young age, both died in my arms, suddenly.    10 years ago, I merely asked a woman to dance.  She was/is quite a bit younger than I, and beautiful.    She came on so strong, for 3 years, and she talked about love and marriage.  I never considered speaking of my feelings.  This continued and then we both finally discussed it.    She got anything she wanted.  The marriage was really over in 3-4 months.  Long story short, I had life threatening surgery, I stayed 17 months and finally divorced her.  I left her well off.  (Is 400K plus, well off?)  (I still care, 10 years now)    How has my ideal changed?  Actually, I have no trust left in me, but, sincerity and honesty would be utmost if I were to do it again.  Ya, looks are important as attraction goes, but I would never trust, that, one with looks could be interested in me now?  I still feel young and can dance better than most men.  I've had younger women ask me to dance after watching me.   I've been hit on by a few women in their 40s-50s.  I brushed that off in a hurry, discarded phone numbers.    I have a friend 63, who has fallen in love with me, her words.  We dance like pros together.  She may be described as overweight but has a young, beautiful face.  I can't let myself.  Just can't.    It's over.  Enough said.    I can tell you that sex drive goes on, but I can't do anything about it, won't.    I love to dance.  Haven't for awhile but I will soon.  Hey, I can still rock, do CW, ballroom, love waltzes.  Maybe I look like an azz on the floor, with white hair, but I learned to not let it bother me as long as my partner is ok.    I spend some time writing musc, lots about my life.  I have written 5 but they need some tweaking.  "A place of love and tears" (CW)  "The ways I love you" (Waltz)  "You set my heart on fire" (Latin bossa)  "Maybe today (I'll forget you) CW  "A heart breaks so quietly" (Pop)  Starting new one, "Memory of memories", not much done.  This is about my memories, of her memories, of someone else.  No, none published.  Ah!  Keeps me off the street, eh?    This is more than you asked for, huh?  I've never told this before.|`|375432572adde7e904658c0aa0e5a4b2aa	My taste has always remained the same.

I am an older lady and while it seems to me that most men my age (50's) and even younger prefer women younger than themselves, the reality of it is that most of you want women are are self-confident, take care of themselves in general and are not gold diggers.      Thanks to all you gentlemen for your honesty in answering.  It is very refreshing.|`|c058a8802f5627063b81819d961b2c72aa	In my early years (20's, 30's, and '40's) I used to think an "ideal woman", was someone that could drink like a fish (without going "barf-o"), and do the "horizontal cha-cha" like a nymph.  But now (in my 60's) if she can just hold her flatulence until she gets outside, is a rare find indeed.....

bbpS3n9Waa	Hmm... I guess I think that it would be pretty hard to "intimidate ordinary people into political docility" by identifying them as sharing in the majority opinion. And the maps sound like an excellent boycott tool  do you know where I could find one? (Of course, this would probably mean that I'd have to shop outside of my county  three guesses which it is  and I'm anti- global warming as well as pro- human rights.) Donations by individuals should be left off, since it encroaches on their right to privacy, but businesses and organizations are fair game.      "Marriage is one of the 'basic civil rights of man,' fundamental to our very existence and survival...." (Loving v. Virginia)|`|TLLklriUaa	The businesses decide to put their money where their mouth was by supporting a bill that denied the civil rights to others.  I feel I have every right to put my money where my mouth is by refusing to do business with bigots.  They had no problem with interfering with the private lives of others, so I am not the least bit concerned that they feel that their privacy is now being violated.    Edit-   "Never has karma been so expedient"- I love you, Jeff!!!|`|2gyJUTzRaa	thanks so much for posting this!  i'm on eightmaps.com right now...i'm gonna boycott all these businesses and encourage everyone i know to do the same!    i think nothing is more morally wrong than intolerance.  these business chose not to tolerate, so it's fair play to do whatever we can to do them wrong.  they donated to injustice.  and if they honestly don't want people to boycott, they shouldn't donate millions of dollars to something like this.  they're stupid and i hope they all go out of business!|`|ulwXFrrJaa	I'm for boycotting these businesses and i'm for this map.      Its terrible business to be a bigot.  If you want to be one in the privacy of your own home, no one will ever find out.  If you want to donate substantial sums of money to suppress 10% of the population of your state's rights, you better be ready to lose more than 10% of your business.  many straight folks like myself see no point in supporting bigotry either.    I live in California.  And I will boycott all these businesses.  This information is available to the public.  you know why?  because the people voted that it should be.  i guess the people have also voted to ban gay marriage.  and the anti gay marriage folk love to push that in your face.  well, turnabout is fair play.  enjoy bankruptcy.  never before has karma been so expedient.|`|4807230affa1ab91b912bc7830a4b01baa	Imagine that. A minority that became upset because the majority voted they weren't entitled to equal rights under the law. I'm not defending the actions of criminals but why would you be surprised that they became upset and did something to let the rest of America know who it was that backed prop 8.|`|LJ6vHfgoaa	>>Understand that I am fully in favor of transparency in government donations -- it's nice to know who's getting money from whom.    Yes, but because of this, I've been too terrified to donate to any politician or political cause for years (well before Prop 8). I prefer not to be stalked and harassed. Is someone going to have to be murdered before our privacy is protected?    Eightmaps.com is about stalking people, not boycotting businesses. Why is it necessary to inform people that Ms. Mary Smith, homemaker, donated $100 if you just want to go after businesses?    EDIT: I see no one on my street donated, so hopefully one of you crazy stalkers won't be throwing bricks through my windows.|`|LQQAQDkIaa	Shoe can fit the other foot too you know.

In short, if it helps relieve the world from bigotry in peace, I'm all for it...|`|AA11503457	The response to prop 8 winning should make it painfully clear that, contrary to claims made during the campaign, the opponents of the measure would have tried to silence pastors/priests/etc. had the measure passed.|`|AxQmd4flaa	Personally, Im all for Eightmaps. I plan on boycotting those bigots myself, and this is a tool I can use to gain knowledge that I will not be giving my hard earned money to a person who is going to turn around and use it to deny rights to 10% of Californians...     But what I find hysterical and hypocritical is that, prior to the election, the Yes on 8 side was using this same tool to find the identities of supporters of the No on 8 side, and was writing them letters of extortion, informing them that they would be boycotted by members of the Yes on 8 side unless the company/person donated an equal amount of money to the Yes on 8 side. The Yes on 8 side then wins the ballot measure and promptly files a lawsuit asking that anyone who donated to the Yes on 8 side should be shielded from their identities being made public. HYPOCRITES MUCH?     They lost the case yesterday. HA HA!!! This is cosmic justice if you ask me.|`|AA10847209	As an alternative to Eightmaps (which I've not heard of before), as Rodney King famously said: "can't we all just get along" ? ( to begin with).

cDezCyOWaa	I am on Mysurvey.com. They don't charge you anything to sign up, but the part I don't like is that they send you a survey like every other day. As far as the points go, for every 1000 points you get $10.00, but its up to you when you want to cash in. So far my first survey was 35 points and my second was 10 points, I have only been on for about a week and have gotten 2 surveys, I wish they would send them more frequently, it will take me forever to get to $100.00 dollars. They have numbers and emails to get in touch with someone if you need to as well, so if you need to get your money I hope they will have no problems.  The thing I look for is a number to call, if they have a number to call, and its free I will go for it, but if they have just an email with no number to call if you have questions then move on.

2WfEo9ivaa	The question is not hostile to me, but so far some answers are.    Wazgud and Juvegirl, that is so unfair and exactly what this question is about. Once again, an unfair attack.    1. Many people have multiple accounts.    2. I have never tried to hide that I have multiple accounts, but rather have gone out of my way to make it obvious which ones are me.    3. I have even linked them all together before through their profile pages to let people know which accounts are mine.    You are confused, did you bother to write to me at any of my accounts and ask about it?     I got an email today from a name I don't recognize, so I have not answered, but at least the person could think to ask.    Joe, Prince of Persia, Akhenaton, Yusef bin Muhammad, Sunburn from Iran, American Idiot, and Imam Al Mahdi.    I have never made this a secret. Many people know who my different accounts are and many people also have multiple accounts. Again, an unfair attack on me.    Juvegirl, I'm especially surprised at you.    Juvegirl, I explained how they could know, I have Klinefelter syndrome, one of three conditions I have. It causes breast enlargement in men. I explained that in that question when the person asked.    Juvegirl, also I am allowed to ask the same question over again? Many people ask the same questions over and over again. Haven't you noticed? I've seen the same guy from Afghan post the same question about zakat repeatedly, and some just keep rewording their Sunni vs. Shia questions, but they are the same questions again and again from those people.    I am sorry that you do not understand the process I am going through. You do judge, you have judged very harshly and very unfairly. I do not reject all the advice, that is not true. Some of it I do not comment on, but some of it too does not answer the question or it demonstrates I need to elaborate. I can't take advice that won't work. I've been given the same advice about using islamfinder to find a mosque about 37 times. I know where the mosque is and there is none other in my area I keep saying.    I also give more details that will help the people be able not just to give me better advice, but themselves and other people in their lives too. That there are not easy solutions for the situations I face does not make me a bad guy, but I am an honest one and I don't pretend to feel well when I don't. That would be a lie and I'm not into that.    And finally, She Said made wrong assumptions and started telling lies about me. But once again, I am somehow the bad guy? How? Please explain it to me, please so I will understand. She Said admitted to finding a way to override the block user function so she can answer my questions and who knows what other hacker things she can do. She overrode the block user function to answer one of my questions! This is obsession with her and it is stalking, but somehow she is the believeable person? Golly gee, you know what, I've been through this before so I will just bow out of the forum now and never be back because I'm not going to have some pretty face tell lies about me and everyone believe her despite glaring evidence to the contrary and have my reputation completely and utterly destroyed by the liar when I try to defend myself and have others in the community -- such as you, Juvegirl -- stabbed me in the back and ignore the evidence in my favor. I've already been through that trauma in real life, not in cyber space, but I won't go through it again ever, not even here. I see it is happening again, though. Goodbye, I'm gone and I won't be back.    Juvegirl, you are clearly not my friend. You showed that with your first answer. Amirah is apparently the only friend I have here.    Rolly polly, I am not here to ask professional advice. The counselors and doctors encourage people like me to develop support networks. I am supposed to ask other people for help when I feel down so that I will not sink lower and so they can uplift me. It's a "that's what friends are for" mentality. I do this for other people routinely, though some on here (one answerer has said she has never heard me say one nice thing to other Muslims, to which I say, open your ears because I do it all the time, you are focusing on the negatives about me, Brigette, you are being unfair) don't give me credit for that, I don't care, I'm not here for those who are unfair to me and who have their ears and eyes closed.    As for the professionals, unfortunately the public mental health system is SEVERELY underfunded and the counselors don't actually help their clients. They want to, but they can't. It's just like how the public defenders cannot serve 50 clients at once, neither can the public therapists but they are asked to in the underfunded system. The system does not work and I do not have private insurance or pockets full of money to hire someone who only has 10 or maybe 15 clients at a time which would be reasonable and sane and could actually help those clients. The ones in the publicly-funded system are grossly overworked and do not have any possibility of doing their jobs correctly. They can often, in fact, cause more damage than good.    Brigette, I don't know who you are. I have responded several times now to your offers of help by explaining that I do not trust you. I have no reason to. Your answers which are grossly unfair and are attacks against me do not give me any reason to trust you. Please, if you want someone to trust you, you have to earn it. You have not earned it, stop blaming me for that.    Juvegirl, I went over all the things you said in your response that were an unfair attack. How did you not attack me? Am I wrong about the unfairness of those things? Which ones? You have only apologized that you did not know Prince of Persia was my account, but what about the other things you said? H|`|zBqt99avaa	I've got nothing against him, however:    it may be because he has a number of identities.  And that whole mahdi thing probably put a few people off.  Not to mention he keeps asking advice on the same topics, and doesn't take any advice, just bickers with anyone who leaves a loop hole.  Oh and getting in the middle of the Prince of Persia's business isn't my idea of cool.    We've all got our quirks on here, and I don't blame him for feeling really put out with the mosque in his town.  But at the end of the day, I really question a lot of this, I mean, in one recent question he mentioned that they knew he was inter-sex at the mosque...how can they know if he doesn't tell?  Why divulge that information so soon?  I don't know, I don't think he's helping himself much and he jumps at certain things, like he was really kinda out of line with She said recently...    I mean if I was upset I might do so as well, you know?  Like I said, I've nothing against him personally, but this might be what's putting people off.  But you're right, people ought to be trying harder to help.    EDIT:  Okay so I didn't know you WERE Prince of Persia.    Okay so I'm deleting my other responses to Joe or whatever, because he's obviously gone way off.  I didn't attack him, and if that's the way he want's to roll, that's fine by me.  I gave all the advice I could, explained myself and that's all I got.    I didn't mean harm, but some people are just desperate to be hurt.  Call me judgmental and your enemy if you want to, but you're wrong.|`|AYs6iFlLaa	Over the last 24 hours I have answered his questions and offered one-on-one help for him including giving him 2 of my personal e-mails and he has not responded, nor has he acknowledged the offers. I sincerely would help any Muslim that needs help and help many people all the time from many different cultures and situations. I am familiar with some of the problems he faces but he refuses to accept help. What more can we do? My husband offered to contact his masjid and speak to the Imam on his behalf. I have offered to do anything he needs to further his walk in Islam, but have had no responses from him only more posted Q's. He has about 7 other accounts and asks the same Q's over and over,but does nothing to help himself.    Edit: i gave my e-mail address in my answers so he was not contacted by me without notification. Anyone who knows me knows that I often offer my e-mail address to ones that need help. Also you see that nowhere in his above response did he mention that such an offer was made. He only has dumped on ones he feels are wronging him in some way, instead of seeking help from ones that will help him.    Edit : Trust? Ok fair enough,but you asked US for help. We can't help you if you don't want it.  Your being unfair to yourself by not accepting help that is offered you. I don't know you either, but I still offered my help, and all I got for that was a kick in the face so, My offer is still here. You make the efforts now. I'm always being hurt in the end for helping others and I expected you were no different, but was hoping that you were sincere. I haven't said one mean thing to you, or about you. I have stated the FACTS. Sorry that I offended you.    Only today did I realize that you had so MANY accounts, but it wasn't hard to put together after the similarity of the Q's and same old - same old. I was still willing to help.    I have not attacked you in anyway! I simply offered my help. I  don't think that anyone here can help you, nor do you really want their help. I won't answer any more of your Questions.|`|rG5G14UHaa	He says that the Quran is corrupt and all holy books have corruptions. don't believe me, then ask him.|`|5ofS2qQYaa	idk about the hatorade, but the dude has about...7 accounts?

wR1XyyrUaa	What exists does not have to be rational or reasonable.    Humans never evolved to intuitively comprehend the true reality of the universe. We evolved in the understanding that A tree is solid, air is empty space, the world is flat, there are no such things as atoms or molecules etc... all have been proven false, and as our Logic, Intuition, rationality and reasoning abilities are the result of life experience and evolution, it is hard for someone uneducated in these fields to understand.    These recent science are for the most part theoretical, but are supported by mathematics, and the scientists, physicists and mathematicians that are producing these are Atheists, and are going into it to discover just how things work, it is highly unlikely that they are all putting some spiritual bias in it.    Just because it is the traditional beliefs of Secularism are being challenged by new science, does not make the new evidence we are getting wrong.|`|lHg9ZqwJaa	All that is real is rational; Even if we currently lack the ability to comprehend it as such.|`|nhGIZE71aa	Are you saying that quantum physics is pseudoscience?  Because I can assure you it is not.  Not only has it been verified to extraordinary precision, but it also forms the foundation of our technology.  It also keeps me employed.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	No!!  You just need to broaden your intellect!!|`|AA11297267	I'm not sure what you're saying here...are you saying we should abandon quantum physics because ignorant, silly people make up things from it to justify their fantasies?    I don't care about pseudoscience.  It's as unsupported by evidence as religion is, and is as worthless.    What would really help the popular conceptions of science is enough education so that the majority of people would be able to rationally tell the real science from the pseudoscience.  And it would probably do in religion, too.    Let's face it:  quantum physics can be weird.  But it's *not* irrational, and it has served as an exquisitely useful means to predict and test natural phenomena at the level of the very small...and even some of it's most un-intuitive predictions have been proven by experiment and observation.  Until (and if) better explanations are found through research, quantum physics is the best and most accurate description we have about how the sub-atomic world works.    Peace.|`|QVO9b0a8aa	Well, pseudoscience is not really a problem, because if it really threatened anything, and the threat was big enough, it would be taken care of, don't worry.|`|feBJEgcgaa	We live in a very, very rare part of the Universe. What seems normal to us is, in comparision to the Universe, not normal.|`|aj5IBTuXaa	I'll wait for the ideas to be corroborated and better explained.  Then - and only then - will I worry about any possible metaphysical issues that seem to stem from these discoveries.    You probably don't know about this, but when Heike Kammerlingh Ohnes discovered superconductivity at the beginning of the 20th century, the fellows of the Royal Academy of London first thought he had committed some form of magic.  Because, of course, any sufficiently advanced technology seems like magic if you don't understand it.    Remember that the first Native Americans wouldn't allow their pictures to be taken because they were afraid the cameras were capturing their spirits, not their images.    Remember that Galileo Galilei was afraid to discuss what he saw in his telescope when he looked at Saturn.  And many folks thought he was dealing with the Devil.    So, OK, the stuff is way out there.  Speculative explanations in the early phases of any discovery are like that.  So what?  It happens all the time.  When it settles down and develops into a consistent theory, then let's talk again.|`|IhzeHAx4aa	science is not irrational by definition.|`|66ae930022bf29f4c8379012ac4ae691aa	Rational is ultimately a person's method of interpreting something.  This method is always derived from a person's personal experience.  Our personal experience, however, is inadequate in terms of understanding a Universe much bigger than what the human being experiences in a lifetime.  Therefore, common sense isn't enough to understand the Universe, and is even detrimental to our understanding of it.    The Big Bang Model (not theory) was originally dismissed as "pseudoscience" and completely unintelligible.  I probably don't have to remind you that the term Big Bang was a derogatory term, meant to make this model of cosmic expansion look suspect.  It is now the accepted cosmological model.    Dr. Neil Degrasse Tyson has a great saying on this subject: "The Universe doesn't care what you think".|`|AA11602341	Quantum physics is not a "pseudoscience".    As for an explanation as to how an intelligent designer could be omnipotent, yet not visible to us is due to dimensional mathematics. We are locked in 3 dimensional space, but if there were beings that are 4th, 5th or higher dimensional, then they could survey EVERYTHING in the 3rd dimension and be perceived as being in multiple places at once. Read the book "Flatland". It's really short and can help you visualize what I'm talking about.|`|v7Wflu78aa	Actually, no real quantum physicist believes/thinks that there is a spiritual implication in string theory.  The notion that quantum theory or string theory supports reincarnation is silly and wrong.    However, if you write a book saying that science supports your religious or spiritual ideas, you'll sell a lot of books, and feel really good about how smart you are.|`|C1SOqQSkaa	Scientific enquiry has reached the point where we are breaking into territory that is deeply counterintuitive. Quantum physics is so weird that even though calculation can be made to an exquisite degree, nobody can really feel it at gut level because it simply doesn't fit 'common sense'.    But this isn't really surprising: we had to get through all the stuff that *did* make sense before we could reach things like wave/particle duality, Schrodinger's Cat and objects being in two places at once.    It's still possible that in time we'll find ways to envision this stuff in the way we do simple mechanics - plenty of people are working on it.    But even if we don't, this by no means throws open the door to any whacky notion that anyone can dream up. People have tried to extrapolate from the Observer Effect to the idea that we can bend the universe according to our will, but there's simply no evidence for it.    If the progress of science has taught us anything it's that we are definitely not special in any way: we're not the centre of the universe; we're not even the centre of the solar system. Nor is the solar system at all unique.    Nor are we the special pets of the creator of the universe. We have no special powers, and are simply a species of primate which has developed a hypertrophied cerebrum. Our only other outstanding characteristic is our hideous hubris.    This overweening sense of our own wonderfulness tends to mean that whenever and wherever science's frontiers happen to lie, there are always hosts of morons claiming that just beyond the horizon of the known are magic, monsters and the ultimate vindication of humanity as the rulers of Reality. So tenacious is this conceit that even when its bases are demolished, they refuse to acknowledge it.    So we have creationists grimly clinging to the idea that we were designed by a superman, woo merchants swearing that they can see into the future, quacks claiming to unblock our 'energy' streams, and god-botherers assuring us of eternal bliss in return for self-denial, prostration and a percentage of our salaries.    The facts are in - it's all balls. Getting this through to the willing dupes is a slow process.|`|KT7cllsLaa	This sounds weird  I do  agree the feelings are indeed a result of amount of chemicals present in our brain..  But the other stuff..i think, it is a hoax and no cool, educated scientist would fall for it  It feels like scientology, i you ask me|`|XDRRg5o4aa	"science and religion are both telling the same story, but science is too young to understand"  People are going to try and incorporate their religious beliefs into science to keep faith alive, it is inevitable.   Science can answer how but it will never answer why.|`|x3ZpztsVaa	Rational?     I'll give you "rational":    It's "rational" to believe that the Sun revolves around the Earth...    It's "rational" to believe that the Earth is flat...    It's "rational" to believe that languages spoken by people other than your own sound "barbaric"...    It's "rational" to believe that stars are affixed to that black thing the night brings about...    SCIENCE is about helping humans overcome the hurdles of "rationality" by putting that rationality to work through careful observation, experimentation and recording...|`|ab5eb6c79489fdbbacde1ce1372f5f98aa	Quantum physics is real science and string theory is based on mathematical models.  The people who use these to justify their beliefs simply don't understand these concepts or have some kind of understanding and justify their assumptions with this.|`|AA11120822	The science itself isn't irrational. People distorting it and using it to justify their dogmatic religious beliefs is.  But honestly, I see nothing wrong with contemplating the "spiritual" (for lack of a better term) implications of the theory that all matter and energy in the universe is connected on a quantum level. Just don't alter the facts to fit your pre-existing notions.|`|8e4506c476b48324af970127ad5cd76faa	Through unrelenting scientific scrutiny - the truth shall be revealed.

AA10259854	The equality of the Manifestations of God is in their Message to us, not miracles.  Miracles are claimed for many who did not come from God.  The importance of Jesus Christ was not that He did miracles but that He came here to save us and lead us back to God.  Baha'u'llah did the same.  Yes, He also worked miracles, but both Jesus Christ and Baha'u'llah told people that they should not tell others, so They did not consider the miracles the most important part of Their work.|`|8e4506c476b48324af970127ad5cd76faa	I once turned FART into FLAME!

5f4qvGLKaa	This really sucks to hear I thought I gave amazing advice!! lol    Looks like he is though|`|pYn2L2DHaa	Try getting to know him so you can tell if he's the kind of person you'd be interested as a friend or a romantic relationship.    Keep this in mind:  ? He might be straight but if he's taking a big academic load, he might not have time for dating.  ? He might be gay, which nixes a romantic relationship but brings in the possibility of having a gay best friend -- and best friend relationships between straight women and gay men tend to last longer than romantic relationships between straight men and women.    You will not know for sure either way unless you take a chance and get to know him.|`|N73oZyY8aa	He's got to be gay to pass up some adorable creature like you!    :))|`|hZiwiboRaa	Bummer.

Since his friends say it, I would probably believe it|`|cuqHAp8Qaa	Oops|`|uvOhOUllaa	well if they didn't say he's gay, what did they say that made you think he was? he might be, or he could just be shy like you said. even if he is gay, you should still be his friend.|`|evEYVoqMaa	yes|`|FF4J59pMaa	Honestly idk. If you really like him talk to him and that will help you see if he likes you back. You can tell if it is a friendship or sumthing more later but become friends with him first. As for is he gay you never know and unless you heard it from the horses mouth you need to find out yourself. Rumors go around and they change very time so you can't really trust rumors.|`|g7gvzhkpaa	no I don't think he's gay , your friends are bring judgmental you said he was shy , can't you meet him at lunch or after school, send him a text or a valentine|`|VpTxqL2Aaa	He could be gay, but then he could be just really shy or even bi. If i were you i'd just start talking to him and ask him if he is... just tell him some friends said he is. it may seem to forward but you wont know for sure until you ask. hey maybe he is straight and the only reason people have said he is gay is just because he is so shy. Maybe he likes you, you never know until you find out. Take a chance. the worse thing that can happen is he either says he is gay or he is not interested.     If it turns out he is gay, dont worry too much. Lots of gay guys i know are super cute and it doesnt seem fair lol. even if he is gay just hang out with him... gay guys can be fun to hang with.|`|fHpPgMlZaa	Until you actually meet him and get to know him you won't know for sure if he's gay or straight.

Jesus will appear in the clouds of Heaven with a shout and 5/6ths of the armies will be destroyed.  So don't be fooled watching your pulpit.  watch the European Union and watch for leaders trying to cozy up to Israel; and coming up with fancy peace speeches.

WEEIySqRaa	For an English speakers, Spanish and German are easy to learn because a lot of the vocabulary and grammar is similar if not the same. Languages that are difficult to learn are those that have a different alphabet (or no alphabet! They may have a syllabery - where there are no individual letters, but sounds). Chinese, Japanese, Korean and other iconic languages are very difficult for English speakers because:     1) they are tonal languages (meaning your tone can change the meaning of the word)     2) there are seperate "icons" for each word (the average Japanese child cannot read a newspaper until they're about 12 yr. old)     3) some of these languages have sounds that we do not have in English (some have 2 sounds for the letters T, D, P, K, three sounds for "TH" etc.)|`|AA11066202	An artificial language like -Ido- or a little harder Esperanto.

AyEkA6Flaa	It can't be "just the sex" that defines one as gay, because a fair amount of curious teenagers experiment with each others of the same sex, but that does not necessarily mean they are gay, since they go on to happily mate with the opposite sex and are truly content and fulfilled in that.    Likewise, I know other gay men (besides myself) who were married to women for many years and were able to do the sexual deed with a female...but deep down they longed to be with a guy.    I believe "gay" has to do with high attraction towards others of the same sex, and yearning to be romantic with someone of the same sex.    If a guy is physically a virgin, but yearns to hold, kiss and snuggle naked with another guy, I'd say he is gay.    If a guy craves a mate of the same sex, I'd say he is gay.    When it feels right and natural for someone to kiss, make out with, and enjoy sex with someone of the same sex -- and they get their high energy and passion from someone of the same sex -- I'd say they are gay.    Sexual acts are the outward expression of an emotional urge to fall in love and connect with someone of the same sex.    If the preferred love object is someone of the same sex, then one is gay.|`|3afb1a9998ec7ae77d5dc07fa7abfe2aaa	think about it - its the sex for virtually 100%.|`|CDft5bscaa	its not sex, its simply the attraction    in an adolescent (the only age at which most people would really even consider questioning their sexuality) its just the sex drive i.e. for whom is a boy getting erections    the emotional stuff is important too but an adult feeling that sort of desire for someone and not just confusing friendship or admiration would already know their sexual orientation|`|SdxAJNRmaa	I agree with Dickey, to be sexually attracted to the same sex. Its not all about sex, but its also about finding a partner of the same sex.|`|4kqvnQtUaa	Well I would say no, it is not about the sex, But more of the connection between 2 men or 2 women, As in comparison between a guy & a gal.
eeHrcxjEaa	You've been watching a little too much South Park.    No, he didn't stick his head in a hat and have a stone tell him what to do. He was not practicing spiritualism. The Urim and Thummim are seer stones.  This is not like a crystal ball. They only helped him translate.  God gave Joseph Smith revelations, through the stones, as to what to write down. To have anything revealed to you using a seer stone, you can't just have the "stones".  They are not "magic" by themselves.  To use them, you need to put all your faith in God and trust that He will show you what you need to see. This is what Joseph Smith did.    And there was never a hat involved.    Thank you for asking rather than just assuming that this is the case. :)   ---------------------  EDIT: Also, if you want to be saved, common sense would tell you not to listen to someone whose nickname is The Christ Puncher.    EDIT 4: What should we have done instead? Allow blacks the priesthood right away, and have all our members be slaughtered by the government for our over-the-top, radical ideas? Remember that if all the members were slaughtered, that would include the new black priesthood holders.  Would that be "moral courage"? It would be pointless.  Better to simply wait a little while to give them the priesthood than to have everyone killed (including them).  Also...moral cowardice? Mormons = moral cowardice? Could you live even half our moral standards for even a month? Go ahead, try it.  Mormons are some of the most morally strong people I have ever known, along with Orthodox Jews, and Jehovah's Witnesses.  Consider this quote:  http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/show/993...  It's by C.S. Lewis.  Not even a Mormon.    I'm deleting my Edits  2 and 3.  If you would like to discuss more, feel free to email me. I think we should keep this discussion off this question as we are discussing things the asker never asked.|`|FDVuAiHOaa	Many think he perpetrated a huge scam, concealed in that hat of his...|`|lHg9ZqwJaa	That would be your sense of reality telling you not to fall victim to a long-dead fraud.    *Edit: If you want to lead a good life, following someone that refused the entry of black people to his church isn't the way to start...    *Edit 2: Plenty of excuses, but I'm not talking about slavery... I'm talking about not allowing blacks into the church (nice atttempt at the straw man though.)    *Edit 3: Excellent justification for moral cowardace.|`|ZtEVlc0yaa	I think we (Everyone, myself included.) tend to focus too much on the Urim & Thummim and forget that it was by the power of God that Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon.     And to the best of my knowledge (Which by no means is impressive.) there was never any hat. :]|`|93fc57ca1c692acd2bd8f1bc7a446e6eaa	No.  The Urim and Thummim was a tool prepared by the Lord for translation purposes only.  Yes, it is true that we are promised a personal seer stone in the Celestial Kingdom through which all things of a lesser kingdom are made known to us.  I have no idea how this works except to say that it is by faith.  The world, and Satan, love to make up false immitations of God's tools and programs.  Thus, Satan uses soothsayers or fortune tellers to try and duplicate prophets.  He uses wizards and sorcerers such as the oned in Egypt, to duplicate the miracles of God.  Thus, Satan uses crystal balls to try and duplicate the seer stone used by God.  The outward appearance seems similar but the power and application are very different.  Don't be deceived by the false duplications.  Joseph strictly went by the spirit in doing the work God sent him to do.  It had nothing to do with what is known today as spiritualism.|`|IqPz1PZOaa	I have no way of knowing if you have yet been made aware of the many strange belief systems that popped up in America during the early nineteenth century and especially between the years of 1830 to about 1850.  The second great awakening appears more like some unfit hourly night watchman sleeping on his clock and unfortunately includes the LDS (Mormon) Church.  Google easily suggests that in order to be involved in something like spiritualism, one monotheistic God is worshiped, something not possible in the Mormon plural gods and plural (many) wives system of conjured beliefs.  Answer - NO -|`|7d16b3b33c15681f9d53425cac12ac67aa	No. The fact that it is mentioned throughout the bible.     Exodus 28:30     30: And thou shalt put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be upon Aaron's heart, when he goeth in before the Lord; and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel upon his heart before the Lord continually.     Numbers 27:21     21: And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the Lord: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him , even all the congregation.     Deuteronomy 33:8     8: And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and they Urim be with thy holy one, whom thou dist prove at Massah, and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah.       And these are only some of the verses mentioned     Others include     1 Samuel 28:6     Ezra 2:63     The point is that the stones were a functional part of the Bible. The Children of Israel used them. Are they guilty of Spiritualism as well?     As for Joseph Smith people rely way too heavily on South Park.     Another factor that is intresting to admit that the Anti- Mormons continue to use this as claims against the Mormons.. It slightly contradicts their claims that Joseph "wrote" the Book of Mormon, as they are basically stating that some sort of 'seer' stone was used. Now they are clearly admiting that something was used by Joseph Smith.|`|24H5tznkaa	People can give you as many answers as they want, referring to the Bible and how it's okay that there were prophets and that the 'seer stone' is okay because God put energy in it...of course there was energy in it, it was from the Earth.     That's why certain stones hold certain properties.     Long before the Bible, long before Christianity, there was Paganism in many strains. These kind of things were going on long before Christianity came into play.     If you can be okay with the fact that Christianity has Pagan roots and take from it the wisdom and guidance that you can, go ahead. But obviously you are smart enough to see the contradictions glaring at you.      Whether or not you choose to be Mormon, you will still have to face that fact in any form of Christianity. It all comes from Pagan roots.    *edit*    Moses turned his staff into a snake. He used his staff to split the red sea.     Druids used staffs to and directed energy with them.     Jesus healed a man from blindness using dirt and his own spit.     Those kind of things have been going in tribes long before Jesus was born.    And Jesus is quoted in the Bible as saying "You can do this too."    He was crucified because he wanted to show people that they could have a personal relationship with God, heal themselves and others, be free thinkers and not judge others.    That is why he was killed. Those things that Jesus spoke of are contradictory to some of the teachings in the Bible.    Maybe you should take a class on religious history/study...or go to a library and read some books on it. Maybe it will make your path more clear to you.    For the record, I'm not saying not to be Mormon, I think we all have to make those kind of decisions for ourselves.|`|nhnmhbxoaa	Don't do it. The elders are great guys and they do a wonderful job at making it very appealing.     You get baptized. You receive the base level priesthood.     Then you get to go to the ward 3 hours on Sunday    You have mandatory family home evening     You home teach     You get a home teacher     Baptize the dead     After 6 months you will realize that their is no lie outside of the church. It is a cult. Do not do it.     You should be more worried that there is not one shred of evidence to support a 14 year old boy and his brother ever had Golden Tablets.     Spiritualism is nothing to be scared of. It is the church you should be worried about that.|`|3bc6709f9978822792e144f5259dd14baa	It really depends on what your definition of "spiritualism" is.      Is Jesus turning water to wine "practicing spiritualism"?  Is healing the sick "practicing spiritualism"?  Is receiving revelation from God "practicing spiritualism"    I think the question is "was he doing things that were authorized by God or was he trying to utilize Satans power or another power".  To me that is what differentiates between spiritualism and true Godly power.|`|8ipxhmNTaa	Good grief, don't the LDS ever listen to their lessons? The church now admits that Smith indeed used his seer stone and his head was in his hat when he dictated most of the Book of Mormon. Look it up guys!    He used the U&T and plates in the beginning, but after he lost 116 pages of the first translation, Moroni took the  U&T back. When Smith started translating the second time a few months later, he didn't get the U&T back and used the seer stone.    He had the seer stone before he started up the church. He used it for hunting buried treasure. He was hauled into court 3 times for fraud when he took people's money for doing it.|`|Kwfo0aRvaa	Now, most historians, Mormon or not, who work with the sources, accept as fact Joseph Smiths career as village magician. Too many of his closest friends and family admitted as much, and some of Josephs own revelations support the contention.  (Richard L. Bushman, Mormon historian, Treasure-seeking Then and Now, Sunstone, v. 11, September 1987, p. 5)      Yes, Smith really did 'translate' the Book of Mormon by putting rocks in a hat. Church Apostle Russell Nelson admitted it:    The details of this miraculous method of translation are still not fully known. Yet we do have a few precious insights. [Oliver Cowdery's brother-in-law] David Whitmer wrote:    Joseph Smith would put the seer stone into a hat, and put his face in the hat, drawing it closely around his face to exclude the light; and in the darkness the spiritual light would shine. A piece of something resembling parchment would appear, and on that appeared the writing. One character at a time would appear, and under it was the interpretation in English. Brother Joseph would read off the English to Oliver Cowdery, who was his principal scribe, and when it was written down and repeated to Brother Joseph to see if it was correct, then it would disappear, and another character with the interpretation would appear. Thus the Book of Mormon was translated by the gift and power of God, and not by any power of man." (David Whitmer, An Address to All Believers in Christ, 1887, p. 12.)  Elder Russell M. Nelson, A Treasured Testament, Ensign, July 1993, 61

If she has loved you and only you then she deserves the same in return even if you are not the man to give it to her.

If you lock a adult in a room for a week, if you lock a kid in they will go crazy too. Porn is very easy to find on the internet these days.

Before they hit puberty without some good talks with their parents or someone they trust, then porn may confuse them a bit.

When you say porn, I'm taking it to mean magazines, and videos for viewing.  If this is what you mean, then there is no difference.  Adults don't need to be looking at this smut anymore than a child.  If you won't let your children look at then you don't need to be either.

AA11297267	I've called upon the christian god to prove himself to me quite a few times -- nothing.    You're absolutely right, god doesn't come and prove himself when called.

BaalBabbies?) were :)    Peace.|`|yNMc5g7paa	Is God so beneath you that he has to prove himself to you, and everyone else every time someone has a doubt in his mind?    That is just ridiculous.    Another thing to note is that the message that God sends to us from the old testament is completely different than the message from the New testament.    The times of the old testament are over, and all God asks of us now is to accept Jesus, and live a good life.    If you don't want to be a christian, that is totally fine.

Little was known about Baal worship aside from the many Scriptural references to it until excavations at Ugarit (the modern Ras Shamra on the Syrian coast opposite the NE tip of the island of Cyprus) brought to light many religious artifacts and hundreds of clay tablets. Many of these ancient documents, now known as the Ras Shamra texts, are thought to be the liturgies of or words spoken by those participating in the rituals at the religious festivals.    In the Ras Shamra texts, Baal (also called Aliyan [the one who prevails] Baal) is referred to as Zabul [Prince], Lord of the Earth and the Rider of the Clouds. This harmonizes with a representation of Baal, showing him as holding a club or mace in his right hand and a stylized lightning flash with a spearhead in his left. He is also depicted as wearing a helmet with horns, suggesting an intimate connection with the bull, a symbol of fertility.    Normally from late April to September there is hardly any rain in Palestine. In October the rains start and continue throughout winter and into April, resulting in abundant vegetation. The changes of the seasons and the resulting effects were thought to come in cycles because of the never-ending conflicts between the gods. The cessation of the rains and the dying of vegetation were attributed to the triumph of the god Mot (death and aridity) over Baal (rain and fertility), compelling Baal to withdraw into the depths of the earth. The beginning of the rainy season was believed to indicate that Baal had awakened to life. This, it was thought, was made possible by the triumph of Baals sister Anath over Mot, allowing her brother Baal to return to his throne. The mating of Baal with his wife, presumably Ashtoreth, was believed to ensure fertility for the coming year.    The farming and cattle-raising Canaanites probably thought that their engaging in a prescribed ritual, a sort of sympathetic magic, helped to stimulate their gods to action according to the pattern enacted at their religious festivals and was necessary to ensure productive crops and herds in the coming year and to avert droughts, locust plagues, and so forth. Hence Baals coming to life again to be enthroned and mated with his consort apparently was celebrated with licentious fertility rites, marked by sexual orgies of unrestrained debauchery.    Undoubtedly each Canaanite city built its Baal sanctuary in honor of its local patron Baal. Priests were appointed to conduct the worship at these sanctuaries and the many shrines on neighboring hilltops known as high places. (Compare 2Ki 17:32.) Inside the shrines there may have been images or representations of Baal, whereas near the altars outside were to be found stone pillars (likely phallic symbols of Baal), sacred poles representing the goddess Asherah, and incense stands. (Compare 2Ch 34:4-7; see SACRED POLE.) Male and female prostitutes served at the high places, and besides ceremonial prostitution, even child sacrifice was practiced. (Compare 1Ki 14:23,?24; Ho 4:13,?14; Isa 57:5; Jer 7:31; 19:5.) Worship of Baal was also carried out right on the housetops of the people, from where sacrificial smoke to their god was frequently seen to rise.Jer 32:29.    There are indications that Baal and other gods and goddesses of the Canaanite pantheon were associated in the minds of their worshipers with certain heavenly bodies. For instance, one of the Ras Shamra texts mentions an offering to Queen Shapash (the Sun) and to the stars, and another alludes to the army of the sun and the host of the day.    It is, therefore, noteworthy that the Bible makes several references to the heavenly bodies in connection with Baal worship. Describing the wayward course of the kingdom of Israel, the Scriptural record states: They kept leaving all the commandments of Jehovah .?.?.?, and they began to bow down to all the army of the heavens and to serve Baal. (2Ki 17:16) Concerning the kingdom of Judah, it is noted that right in the temple of Jehovah there came to be utensils made for Baal and for the sacred pole and for all the army of the heavens. Also, the people throughout Judah made sacrificial smoke to Baal, to the sun and to the moon and to the constellations of the zodiac and to all the army of the heavens.2Ki 23:4,?5; 2Ch 33:3; see also Zep 1:4,?5.    Each locality had its own Baal, and the local Baal was often given a name denoting his being attached to a specific locality. For instance, the Baal of Peor (Baal-peor), who was worshiped by Moabites and Midianites, took his name from Mount Peor. (Nu 25:1-3,?6) The names of these local Baals later came to be transferred through a figure of speech (metonymy) to the localities themselves, as, for example, Baal-hermon, Baal-hazor, Baal-zephon, Bamoth-baal. However, although there were many local Baals, officially, among the Canaanites, it was understood that there was actually just one god Baal.    A different Baal cult was introduced into Israel in King Ahabs day (c. 940-920?B.C.E.), that of Melkart, the Baal of Tyre. (PICTURE, Vol. 2, p. 532) Ahab formed a marriage alliance with the daughter of the king of Tyre, named Ethbaal (meaning With Baal). This resulted in Ethbaals daughter, Jezebel, importing this more virile cult into Israel, with many priests and attendants. (1Ki 16:31-33) Finally, a famous showdown came at Mount Carmel between Jehovah and Baal.    Likely because Baal, believed to be the owner of the sky, was regarded by his worshipers as the giver of rains and fertility, a drought was ordered by Elijah in the name of Jehovah. (1Ki 17:1) After three years and six months of drought, Baal having proved unable to bring an end to the drought in answer to the many appeals undoubtedly made by his priests and worshipers, Elijah summoned all the people to Mount Carmel to witness the great test as to who is the true God. The tes|`|BQ6WmoHiaa	I think you confused the use of the word "test" here with the scientific use.  These are not tests that are repeatable for validation of a theory.

The responses are a good read.  I have nothing to add to any of this, but I thought I'd recommend a few books that tend to "explain" the evolution of (the) "god(s)".  I'm not claiming that these works are THE answer, but they certainly do raise some interesting points.    "Genesis Re-visited"    " The Earth Chronicles"     Both written by Zechariah Sitchin|`|UfNG9umXaa	Baal was (is) a god (false) of Rain,Thunder and fertility. Or any false God. There is but ONE God|`|2ieiGIhTaa	All Hail the Mighty Baal!|`|AA11232725	But instead we find that God does not come and prove himself when called.    Actually God does come and prove Himself when called, if He determines that proving Himself is in accordance with His will for a situation. He doesn't come at the beck and call of people who are testing Him like some lackey.    In the story that you mentioned God had one prophet against a group of false prophets in from of His people who didn't know which way to turn.    1 Kings 18:21  And Elijah came to all the people, and said, "How long will you falter between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow Him; but if Baal, follow him." But the people answered him not a word.  22  Then Elijah said to the people, "I alone am left a prophet of the LORD; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men.    God honored the faith and courage of His prophet in order that His will for His people might come to pass.    God does the same thing today only not usually in so dramatic a fashion. When Christians honor God with their time, talents and treasures even when it looks like they will come up short, God comes through for them and gives them a testimony that glorifies Him and encourages others to trust in God also.|`|p6wwiQG3aa	a statue of Baal fell down before the ark of the covenant every day it was in the posses ion of the Philistines|`|NlzlBV8Haa	"With a story like this in the Bible, you would think that God could not be proven false in this way, But instead we find that God does not come and prove himself when called."

AA10311549	As far as i can see from reading history and observing current events all my life, the institutions of "revealed truth" religions have brought by far more unnecessary grief, fear, repression, tyranny, oppression, pain and misery than from any other cause.    It is only the advent of secular governments and its concomitant support of scientific development which has brought an end to much of the world's hunger and fear and brought a greater quality of life to mankind.  Almost every social and civil rights advancement this world has seen has been bitterly fought by institutional religions.    Both the "golden rule" and to love our "neighbor" are good proscriptions for peace and justice, however, many times they are overcome by selfishness and greed.  Especially of governments and institutions.      But before one can love one another correctly, one must understand truth correctly.  And "revealed truth" religions have fought against the discovery of truth through the ages.    ======================================...  One person replied:  "if the world followed christianity, TRUE christianity, not all the crap thats has been made up, then the world would be a paradise"    Well, bud, we have had Christianity for 2000 years and it has not made any difference.  In fact Christianity condoned slavery for 1800 years, resisted every effort for human rights, conducted 500 years of the Inquisition, murdered millions od people in the name of religion and for heresy, and still resists all real social advancement.    " how about the seven sins....imagine all of us not commiting any sins."    "after the bible stopped being taught, the amount of child pregnancies, children taking drugs, homocide, and suicide have gone through the roof"  What a load of pure nonesense.

Do you even know how to read?    " no war, under the laws of the bible"      Have you actually even read the Bible?    And Institutional religions were frequently the instigator of many of our wars.

QYu8KrXTaa	Hi, Yes, even this material world isn't to solid. It is a writhing mass of atoms which are really only electronic forces. The outside of atoms is electrons which are doing billions of orbits per second. This applies to the cement and steel and gold and bananas etc all made of the same protons, neutrons and electrons arranged in different numbers. The Bible says God(Jesus) put it together out of nothing(actually His energy) and is holding it together. This energy is what is released in atomic explosions and is the heat source in the sun.

4QizPDQNaa	okay, wow. these answers are wild. anyway, i can think of  a variety of reasons 1.) the media often casts black people as the funny, sarcastic ones who make racist remarks seem clever. 2.) some white people make "racist" jokes about themselves so it seems okay--for example: i can't dance--i'm white! i have a redheaded friend whom i love dearly, but he thinks it's funny to refer to himself as a cracker. 3.) blacks truly were oppressed for many years and it wasn't just by racist remarks, so a white person might feel awkward openly criticizing a racist remark made by a black person 4.) many black people feel justified in saying such things, and if they're supported and encouraged by their friends and family, who's going to stop them? of course, black people aren't the only ones who get away with saying racist things. most non-hispanics aren't criticized for making awful "mexican" jokes. or what about people who make racist remarks about people of middle-eastern descent?  nobody should say racist things (i certainly try not to), but most people do so without reproach. for those who seem to think that the ball is in our court and all blacks expect special treatment and we are a ridiculous group of people who need to realize that times have changed: maybe we aren't being lynched anymore, and no, you weren't the ones enslaving us, but the attitudes towards minorites have been passed down from generation to generation, just as the attitudes of black people toward white people have been passed down. "get over it and move on" doesn't quite do the trick. racism isn't like a trend-- "oh, blacks being mad at whites is soo last year"--it's a mindset and it hasn't gone away. i think it's safe to say that most answers on this page--from blacks and whites-- reflect that fact in their assumptions, criticisms and insults.|`|cLgghhuXaa	1) Because it is seen as vengance or bitterness from history when it is racism against Whites.    2) Because when Whites accuse us of being racist, we can just throw the past 400 years in your face.    *** Not saying it is right... but those are two reasons.

And usually nobody cares cause 90% of racist words are used to insult blacks.|`|a3adecd468f8217562e162004a849a7faa	Getting a taste of your own medicine? Now you know how bad it hurts?|`|VEoURHoCaa	like what??|`|REqcgQB1aa	Okay whites say racists things also. Come on now why can't we all get alone.. It's just a color.|`|0ugOTc5Kaa	wow so when someone asks this completely legitimate question most of the black people are all "get over it, whatever or stop whining"  well, eff you guys  next time someone's racist against you, all you deserve is the whole effing world saying "get over it"  fxcking idiots i swear|`|X23Ttl6Faa	becaues theres no laws protecting white people|`|y5HQIRcAaa	...people tend not to mind of the poor, uneducated and raging bull temper
PuWucUs3aa	it happened to me one time. i advice you to forget about her, think of every hurtful things she's done to you so you can get over her soon. throw away all your memories. i know its hard to do but it works with me, try if it does to you.    that kind of girl doesnt deserve to be loved nor respected/trusted.|`|d956b5a86c3910ccc374a8987ce51194aa	Forget about her...she treated you badly and you deserve much better...you can e-mail me and we can talk about it if you want...hope i helped...  =D Cheers|`|EMEpr7Fcaa	She's obviously not good enough for you. If she really loved you she wouldn't have dated her ex behind your back, or lieing or doing anything like that! Forget about her and move on to someone who loves you and cares about you.|`|uEBuNRY8aa	I do not understand a word you just wrote.    My advice:    Just move on.|`|KszocgnSaa	Sounds like a current situation of mine. I say she cares but was confused and its long distance relationship so thats hard/near impossible. I'm sure she is honestly sorry for cheating. She may be just as conflicted as you. She isn't worth your time tho.
BQ6WmoHiaa	Who cares how wikipedia was founded?  It's not like they wrote it - it's written by anyone who wants to write and be peer reviewed.    FYI, your Mom's sister is egregiously ignorant based on that little Obama factoid you just dropped.    As for the Golden Compass, it is true that the author's intention of that story (and the two that follow it to make the trilogy) was to promote the idea that there is no such thing as God.  However one wants to take that is obviously up to them.  Personally, I don't care about the content of that message, what bothers me is the intention of this person wanting to try and communicate this to children and bypass their parents.  There's something dark about that.    God bless you.|`|5WbJvBdeaa	omg no. my parents are nothing like that! lol|`|GW8LVWT8aa	I think you're aunt is a bigot.|`|v6vYmceSaa	Not yet but now I will, if this is true.|`|gOKi1dcVaa	This sort of thing makes me want to cry.....|`|08Ksc5Oiaa	lulz.  Obama's African.  African is not Arab.  Not all Arabs are Muslim.  Not all Muslims are terrorists.    Oh, stereotypes.  How you make me giddy with laughter.|`|bc46dad1b25f4cb2ef6fc328aa43d25baa	Tragically bigoted... poor you to have such an awful aunt|`|TLLklriUaa	I am sure some do. My favorite was the Christian mother in Georgia who wanted Harry Potter books banned from the schools because they promoted witchcraft even though she admitted she had never actually read any of them herself.     No word on if she was going after The Wizard of Oz and Macbeth next.    And your aunt is against Obama because he is black, not a Muslim- trust me.|`|bEeozqacaa	First I am an Atheist, although my parents are Christians.  There is nothing wrong with Atheism.  I do not know if Wikipedia was founded by an Atheist.  "Happy Holidays" is a better term than "Merry Christmas" as there are people who do not celebrate Christmas, although I celebrates Christmas's commercial side, not the religious side.  Golden Compass is a fiction movie, there is supposed to be disbelief.  Obama is a Christian, not a Muslim.    My parents would not ban Wikipedia.|`|lHg9ZqwJaa	That's why I stick to Encyclopedia Dramatica.|`|SGSl5yeAaa	It's possible... there are lots of parents that restrict their kids from using any but a select view websites.    The Golden Compass thing, btw, is because the book was written by an atheist who admitted the book was written to undermine God.|`|ridu0Rtwaa	Who cares who founded it?    We all know that it relies on non qualified posters and that there is a huge problem with people editing and changing entries!!    Time it featured as the most unreliable source of reference in the Guinness Book of Record!!|`|1TYZDRUqaa	Your mom's sister, Your Aunt, needs to seek professional help right away.|`|9mLjDa5kaa	"Wikipedia" is so inaccurate anyway, that it's no loss if someone does ban it.|`|ulwXFrrJaa	Your aunt should boycott the United States of America.|`|p6wwiQG3aa	No, I eat corn grown by Atheist farmers too.    If it was solely promoting the Atheist view I would, but it has thousands of authors|`|ebbe742a1d8629f5a2fa4466f3367c64aa	That's ridiculous. I've never heard of anyone doing that, although I know some schools ban Wikipedia because some of its facts are inaccurate.|`|v7Wflu78aa	I put up an abbreviate quote from Wikipedia (about Meher Baba) a few days ago, and it was deleted!    I included the link so that users could see I was being accurate and honest, yet is was still yanked.|`|eZbkg3BWaa	Why would it matter..?    And are there SERIOUSLY people who would do that?!  Wikipedia still has the same functions, no matter what its founder was (ir)religiously. What is atheism..? Contagious through the internet? Do we ALL have transferable web c00ties now?    *Scratches head*.|`|KgYIYXEtaa	It's telling that the American home-schooled are so cocooned, their parents think they need their own pathetic little version (Conservapedia).
LFwQPrxbaa	You need to take a step back... SHE'S WORKING RETAIL!!  If she were really so successful, she wouldn't be working the floor.  Times are really hard for retail stores right now, next time you're in the store, tell her that things must be rough if she's working the register and that you wanted to help support her family by buying there instead of amazon and then just let her respond/ fill the silence.  No need to say anything about yourself, she'll be on the defensive.    Good Luck!|`|AA10064810	Unless you want some reconciliation or have to spend time around them, you say nothing.  I wouldn't shop there anymore.    As for being better off, she has to work for her family.  It is the parents' generation which built the business, inherited the money, etc.      The only control this person has over you is in your mind.  You read her every expression as a put down.  You decided she as better off, luckier, etc. because she is thinner and blonder than you are.    One thing to remember is that most people have all that stuff because they are willing to have huge payments due.  Of course they can have a bigger house, newer car, etc.     Watch how you think about yourself.  You say you are educated but not lucky.  Get lucky by choosing a career where there are actually jobs.  If the jobs are somewhere else, move there.  And, the fact that your siblings got an education and are doing well isn't something that should make you stand out in her eyes.    I think you need some career counseling and to do some work on your self-esteem to work out how you feel about yourself and the way you are living now.    These are hard times.  This is not the time to compare yourself to a bully, no matter how golden she appears to be.|`|lwG6tvOqaa	I hate when things happen like that. You work hard in school, and then some lazy loaf who just barely made it is doing better than you, and KNOWS it.     IF she was that mean to you, then i wouldn't shop there again unless you have NO choice. If that is the case, then try to get rung up by a cashier who is not her. IF probably gives her some pleasure in knowing that she has more money than you, and seems to have the better life.    However, even though it LOOKS like she is doing better than you, that might not be the case. Who knows what she had to do to get in that position. She might have had to do things that she would be ashamed of if they got out. That is what i think about whenever i see a popular kid doing better than me even though i work hard.|`|dPULl5hjaa	First, I would return the purchase to the store!     Right, who gives a rat's butt about this ex-bully.  There was no excuse for her to act so pathetic back in high school.    This is my take on the issue:  I think the older we get people (we graduated with) are way too anxious to speak and have conversation.  Once again, who cares?  That was then and this is NOW 2009 and you can't forget what happened - which I don't blame you!  If you want to say something to the pathetic people in high school, say Hi with an attitude and walk away.  Also, you could just walk the other way.    This is what I do.  I look at it this way.........there was nothing wrong with me in high school and hardly no one talked to me was was bullied.  Now, I'm 50 yrs old and you want conversation?  If these people were the last ones on earth, I would pass.  I'm very rude to them verbally.  I don't go to class reunions because the "clicks" were still there after 5yrs, 10yrs, etc.  The reason I'm this way is what I mentioned above:  I'LL NEVER FORGET!  One last thing, I do look so much younger than the "other" high school people!    Stand tall and be fortunate for what you've done in your life!|`|vs5rK3iRaa	Wow, you can really hold a grudge!  Let go of it and be grateful for the life that you have instead of clinging to a chain link fence gazing at her life.  Be proud of your accomplishments, not envious of hers.  Oh, sure, never go into her store again, but if you live in the town where you grew up, you're bound to run into people you knew back then, and not all of them will be your favorite people.  If you really need something to say to them, why not something like, "I remember you. You were a real bit(h in high school. Hope you're doing better now."|`|4PQOiSfZaa	Don't feel embarrassed about it. Just move on.
efb24eedcf484b875157731a08fef57aaa	He's a wise brother, he is following the word of Allah (SWT).    "Hold fast to the Rope of Allah, all together, and be not divided."

Very important.|`|k1skxCuEaa	It is hypocrisy!|`|rdoPeWnzaa	That's pretty smart. I want them to unite too. In the end we are all muslims so what's the problem.

VpTxqL2Aaa	yes! and actually that what happened... its how i came out lol. people kept saying hey he is cute go ask him out.... which i could have cuz im bi but i wanted a girlfriend.... so i kinda just screamed it in class lol.    if worse comes to worse dont scream it in a class just tell these people who kept saying that, that u are gay.|`|AfVSH3ghaa	yes i just say i dont want one|`|FJPKtZN5aa	yes all the time|`|wvJxtmJTaa	Lol no..i started wearing boy clothes at 11 but noone asked if i was gay until i was 16..but if they keep asking just say..im "more into school" or something as such if you're not ready to come out the closet|`|B667elmWaa	Yea we've all been there, got the T shirt.|`|s0rrkt9Uaa	yeah...|`|PuWucUs3aa	that happened to me before. but after i confessed to my mom my real sexuality,i never heard of that question again. lol|`|JknwX64saa	Me sometimes.

o0I5YXMNaa	..and what happens when you refuse?|`|AhO0Uoppaa	i think its rude if i didnt ask and they dont take there shoes off|`|foKxdNeTaa	...You're lucky, you have to take off your underpants to get into my house.|`|lynmeenmaa	no i think if ur going into someones house u should live by their rules, if they dont wear their shoes around the hosue to keep it clean then why shouldnt they ask u to take urs off? unless u offer to hoover before u go.|`|913fb8ceffd6a8e7aea30ec81720fd2eaa	In most Asian countries, and a lot of European ones, you are asked to remove your shoes before entering someone's host.  It's not meant to be offensive - actually, it's a sign of respect that you're not tracking in dirt.    Back in the day, people slept on their floors.  Why would you sleep on a floor that you've had people tracking in dirt and mud and who knows what else?  You wouldn't.      While the raised furniture and generally cleaner streets we have now may seem like a good deterrent, the tradition still remains.|`|dPULl5hjaa	Well, I say it - let me explain.  I don't say it to family members because we all take off our shoes in each others house.    Delivery people:  Heck YES - It snowing here, do I want to clean up after them?  HARDLY!  I tell them to "remove" the shoes!    No, we don't have OCD.    Wait until YOU OWN A HOUSE - you don't know what you may do.....|`|61ZtWyqKaa	some people keep religous icons in their house and in their religion they do not wear shoes to places of worship    for others it may be a cleanliness thing after all your shoes go everywhere and no one wants the whole worlds dirt and germs on their floor or carpet     it may be that shoes will dirty the carpet and how many of you know that shoes especially mens shoes can damage wooden floors that have have poly coating on them       and lastly some ppl have small children in the house and as we all know babies crawl on the floor we would be horrified if a baby was crawling in a public place where ppl have walked all over so this applies in our homes too|`|bfjs9wSLaa	nope, it's ok.  it's not being controlling it's either a religious things or a preference.  don't hate =)|`|TtOCh3JSaa	No, I don't think it's rude. Some people are fussy about their carpets and floors and for some people it's more of a cultural thing. I would prefer not to take them off but I wouldn't hold it against someone for asking me too.|`|VDvdrCjmaa	Hah, I never though of it that way, I always take my shoes off, and ask my guests too, I never really knew it was controlling, I honestly don't care what people's socks look like either :P|`|i2ZAVM2aaa	If your Shoes are not Clean you should leave them outside|`|shaO0coWaa	No,my best friend's parents do that.In some cultures also,it's a sign of respect to the person's home.I normally don't take off when entering someone's home unless I'm told to because I don't ask people to remove their shoes when entering mine.|`|AA10077992	You've been watching 'Come dine with me' haven't you ? LOL!  I've had kids back and fore all day today . I gave up telling them to get their snowy shoes off first !  Eventually it was time for tea and they left their shoes by the front door. They walked across the shiny tiled floor with wet socks and left foot marks and then when it was time for them to go home I noticed white marks from the salt/grit and an astro turf  residue on the wooden floor.    WHAT THE HELL ! they had a brilliant day and it only took me 20 minutes to restore the shine !|`|vs5rK3iRaa	Carpets are expensive and hard to clean.  Would you want to assume the responsibility for cleaning or replacing their carpet if you stain it?  Hardwood floors scratch easily if there is gravel, or even grit on your shoe.  Do you want to pay to have it refinished?  Just take off your shoes like your host asks and be a man.  It's not like they're asking you to empty your pockets into a basket, get undressed and put on a robe.|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	In some cultures, and with some people from various cultures, it is customary and only polite not to track outside filth into someone's home.  Often you'll be provided with inside-the-house slippers of some sort but not always.  A little warning in advance would be nice but, hey, if they didn't warn you and you had holes in your socks or your feet reek, that's the chance they take when they ask folks to leave their shoes at the door.  I would ask people to do that when they come into my home except they'd probably step on cat spitup or scattered litter or cat claws or whatever on the floor--I try to keep the place vacuumed but the cats are better at distribution.  However, should your shoes go AWOL, I would expect the homeowner to pay for replacement--it is their home and they are responsible for their visitors' possession since they asked the visitors to leave it at the door.|`|Ld1vLH8Kaa	My feet would soon offend them, let me tell you lol|`|4PQOiSfZaa	Shoes track in dirt and other bacteria that trail throughout the house because of the grooves in the shoe. It's just sanitary to take your shoes off when you enter a house.|`|v6yEkCvHaa	my thoughts are that u r a joker to the highest level 'You may be poor with a hole in your sock!' HAHAHAHAHAHAHABHA|`|Iqco1PcQaa	i always wipe my shoes on a mat before leaving someones house|`|uxvskU7Xaa	its there house - no its not offensive - didn't ur mom tell u wear clean underwear|`|4uB0bbhnaa	I always take my shoes off when I come into the house, as do my family,and so does anyone who visits    Most of my friends do this too    Floors are for walking on, yes, but not with dirty shoes from outside    We always supply spare slippers ,if required    To be honest we picked up the habit when we lived in Sweden   as it is common practice there, for most people|`|DGFc8TbLaa	No its a good thing, think of all the dirt and dogshite and spit lying all over the streets, do you really want to walk that all over your friends carpet.?|`|25d446cf62508e0d3ad669755f76bfb8aa	I don't expect people to take their shoes off in my house and if I went to someones house and they asked me to remove my shoes, that would be my last visit. Floors are made to be walked on and unless a persons shoes are obviously muddy or caked with something really gross, there is no reasonable explanation for expecting people to remove their shoes. Ignorance about what is brought in on the shoes as opposed to what might be hiding on the bare or socked feet of visitors seems to be the norm for some people today. I've had a foot fungus and I wouldn't wish that on anyone or want another one, so keep the shoes on, please!|`|AA10064810	My sister asked people to take off their shoes because her house came with white carpet.  She did not force them to do it.  Do as my mother said, wear clean (not holey) underwear because you never know when you might be in an accident.    My sister did not let in strangers, neither do I and neither should you.    There is nothing wrong with being poor or having darned or holey socks.  If that's you, that's you.  Why be embarrassed?    How people comport themselves in your house is up to you.  You might have rules (coasters) that others think are silly, too.|`|HKNbWjtOaa	no just go with the flow. would be quite funny if you asked for people too take just one off though wouldn't it !|`|rDs2e1Nhaa	I never wear shoes in my house and I expect people to take theirs off  when visitin. My carpets are light in colour I do not want tar  grit or dog poo trodden. It's  also to do with Hygiene.|`|aZjZyccsaa	No, I ask people to take their shoes of when they come in to my house, why should my carpets get dirty?|`|xXWSpw5Saa	they are neat freaks, i tell my friends to keep their shoes on if they want, but i take my shoes off anyway to be polite|`|KBVAbwUXaa	obviously your house is dirty and you've never lived in the comfort of a clean home. Just don't go to their house anymore. Go hang out with your  buddies with the cold hardwood floor and gritty dirt all over it.|`|hVuPqHzsaa	I don't think it is offencive. It is respectful of someones home.|`|bSqzbDPFaa	not really some people have a no shoes in house policy especially if they just got new carpet.|`|69b91f42927e8e3de27734e3a92e06f6aa	I agree.     I went to a Christening once, everyone was in suits and posh frocks and when we went back to their house for the reception they made us all take our shoes off! We looked ridiculous!|`|P0uh2Ckiaa	I always saw it as a polite thing to do. Usually i check the area around the door when i enter. If i see shoes there I'll ask if i should take mine off as well. Usually it's not that they think I'm dirty, but up here in Wisconsin it's much MORE rude to track snow and salt into someone's carpet (doormats can only take off so much). I've never been offended when people ask, and seeing as i have light beige carpet in my own house, I consider it polite for visitors to remove or offer to remove their shoes.|`|RgbARcJTaa	OMG ARE YOU CRAZY  i would never allow someone to come into my house with shoes on  and yes i kind of do have OCD   but thats not the point   the point is if you have a carpet you hover it ... right?  whats the point if you hover and someone just walks in and brings in dirty in to your house  or if you mop you floors and someone just brings germs right back inside   and its not because they control you its becuase its CLEAN  you live in a house not the streets  you dont have a **** in the toliet and not flush it again and again and again  you have a piss  and wash your hands    so you clean your floor|`|f419df7a7a06e14dfdf6ab874c949c5baa	for some people, houses are things to be presentable, and not necessarily look lived in.  this isn't great, but it isn't bad, and you just have to accommodate peoples idiosyncrasies.    if you new some people that DID spit on their carpets at home, you would expect them to follow your no-spit rule at yours, right?|`|V7ho7Ihlaa	I don't think it's offensive at all.  My house isn't like that (partly because it's mainly hardwood flooring), but I've been in plenty of houses that are.  Nothing offensive about it.  By walking into a house with your shoes on you're dragging every other dirt and bacteria you stepped on with you.  Be it dog piss, human spit, dirt, whatever bacterium is in the dirt, etc.  Some people just don't want that embedded inside their carpet.  Why would that be offensive?|`|lwG6tvOqaa	Sometimes it is, because it makes me feel dirty and weird, and it makes me a little uncomfortable if my socks arent as clean as they should be.    IF i went to a strangers house and they demanded that i take my socks off, there is a good chance that i wouldnt go back, and if i did, i would probably just sit in the car and wait for the visit to be over. Or i would meet them somewhere else.    Some people are poor, and they can't afford to keep the carpet clean with those fancy services like Stanley Steamer or Molly Maid. Or they just got fresh/clean carpet, and they know how much hassle it took to get it, so instead of watching it get dirty/messy all over again, they would rather just you take your shoes off.    Try to always keep an extra pair(s) of clean socks in your car or with you at all times, so that you can avoid the embarassment of holey socks.|`|VyZkbi8Daa	I don't think soo  Like someone saidd  Its religion, and plus you shoes came from outside, it could track drit or bacteria into the house.  I wear slippers in my house o_o|`|JODVNkU8aa	I don't mind but I find that some do it because they are mean and don't want to spend the money on cleaning and that means they keep the heating turned down and my feet get bl**dy cold !!|`|PShlj7Lxaa	LOL!  "Hole in your sock."  Better for them to  remove their shoes off at the door then to see they have dirtied your floor.  It would be irritating to have to clean that up later yourself and it would be even worse for you as a host, to ask your guest to get down on their knees and to clean up  the mess they made.|`|jpAzVmG0aa	Of course it isn't. People like keeping their houses clean. If I hadn't denied all my brother's friends in the past, I wonder what my carpets would be like. It's shoes for OUTDOORS, so it's only right to take them off inside where you don't need them.|`|wig4qCeJaa	In some cultures, it's expected.  So why not respect it?|`|uzi5lvkcaa	It's not meant to be...I suppose it would depend on where you were raised.  I live in Hawaii, and we have so many different cultures, and many of the traditions have been adapted to by other cultures.  It's usually out of respect for someone else's home that we don't track dirt from the outside into the house.  If you had a white carpet, or a beautiful laminated wood floors..it doesn't matter whether you have a doormat or not, ..constant trampling over the carpet or flooring with your shoes on ..brings the outside dirt and grime into the house, and can scuff up the shine on the floors.    It has nothing to do with people being controlling.  When I visit the mainland, I automatically remove my shoes upon entering someone's home, and if the people that I'm visiting don't mind the shoes,..they usually just say, it's ok you can keep them on.    Most people that have lived here a long time usually take off their shoes outside, and come in.  When a visitor comes that doesn't know the custom..it's alright to politely ask...Would you mind removing your shoes before coming into the house..it is customary and much more comfortable.  I sometimes think that when people walk in my house with their shoes on, I say, why don't you take off your shoes, relax, ..stay a while. because it makes me feel like their in a rush to go somewhere else so they keep their shoes on.  In Japan, they usually walk into the house backwards out of their shoes or slip ons, so that when they walk back out, their shoes are in the ready to leave position.
9O3prIUpaa	Wow, that's so me.  I'm in foster care, 16, on Seroquel, bipolar, controlling, manipulative... the whole deal.  Weird.    Listen, he probably has BPD too.  Look into the symptoms and see if it seems to fit.    Don't nag him, but let him know you love him.  If he's as up and down as me, you'll never know if he just wants to see you grovel, or if he really needs space, so you should probably go for the balance shot.  When dating someone bipolar, the most important thing to do is take care of yourself.  If they see that you have boundaries, that you won't beg, or cry, or fall apart, or over-react and run away - if they see that you respect yourself and them while still understanding... they'll learn to respect you too.    Understand that he's sick, not an asshole.  Their's a chemical imbalance in his brain that's making him vicious or cold.  Take care of him when you can, but always love yourself first.      Good luck.|`|LOSfacl5aa	It sounds like he needs more medication. There are other medications that can be added to help the seroquel. Many doctors do not want to add the other meds because they can stack up and have harmful side effects.  You need to decide if this relationship is worth it. Your boyfriend has a health problem, do you want to put up with the grief of supporting him or not. I am also bipolar and I understand that it can be difficult to put up with us, but remember we cannot help it.
QenW1Ok7aa	T- You've said nothing nice about this person.[actually, you said some really mean things, but hey, it's stressful to deal with people who have mental health issues, I know]    My point is this-It doesn't sound like you like this guy AT ALL. So maybe you should rejoice in this 'silent treatment', and be glad he's out of your life now?    Seroquel-I'm very familiar with it,I have two people in my home on it. It is a pretty expensive drug- drs. only prescribe it for severe cases. It does not completely 'stabalize' a bi-polar person- NOTHING does that. It only helps.    I don't think this guy is being a jerk. People with bi-polar disorder go through major ups and downs, even when their meds are just right.If he needs to retreat and stay isolated for a while, he is not doing it to hurt you, or because he doesn't care for you. It is just too hard for him to interact with anyone right now-even the people he cares about most.     If you enjoy spending time with him when he is healthy, then you will have to learn to accept these bad times, EXPECT these bad times, and accept him for who he is. But if he isn't that much of a joy in your life when he IS present and all there, then, don't bother. He isn't trying to hurt you though, I promise.|`|dPULl5hjaa	He's a "f....ing" loser.    Bipolar people will never to cured and only their meds are changed throughout their life.  They are pathetic people to date, get married to, etc.    And you "do it" - yuk!

Even when they are "under control" with their drugs, they still don't seem to have a great deal of social skills and become overly sensitive about things so fast, yet are too fearful to ask for explanation and get all twisted up inside about what the motive is and end up making a bigger deal of something that is almost meaningless to you.  And turning silent is their way of dealing with the situation without storming around.  Their judgment is often off too which makes it very hard for other people to be around them.  Your bf also has more then simple bipolar problems and he'll never be able to really care and share and be responsible to someone else until he gets himself straightened out.|`|jLFCXJwtaa	And this guy gets laid?  Seriously, dumb him.  No one deserves to be treated like that, and its deplorable that he can hide behind his "disorder". It doesn't matter if you have a chemical imbalance, common sense and good morals tell you not to treat someone who cares about you like that.  Hell, he has basically wasted his life and sounds like he'll never amount to anything.    Leave him, get into a good college, find a nice young man who can respect you, treat you the way you deserve, and won't be a total loser.|`|RgbARcJTaa	give him the silent treatment right back  your too good for him  leave him and find someone that will love you
FyHaU0D6aa	32.    Sentence no. three is correctly punctuated.    In the first sentence, there should be no commas surrounding Stairway to Heaven, since the commas serve to indicate exclusiveness (i.e., that there is only one classic song in existence, and thats Stairway to Heaven).    In the last sentence, its the exact opposite: there is, by definition, only one person who can be Bills first wife, therefore Helen Hobbes should be surrounded by commas.    In the second sentence, ?War and Peace for example? is a parenthetical sentence and should be surrounded by commas.      33.    The first sentence is correctly punctuated. The exclamation mark here serves to prove that this is not merely a statement, but an exclamation!    The other ones are not technically incorrect the way they are, but they would flow more naturally (unless we allow for non-generic situations) if punctuated differently:    Oh!

Thanks!|`|6qsTmMQaaa	I don't know how old you are, so some of these might seem a little too young, or a little too old for your age, but here are some suggestions:    1. Make them a clay coffee mug, one for each parent. To make it very personal, you could engrave a message into the mug for each of them. Maybe you could paint them in your parents' favorite colors.    2. Make them a collage, and use their favorite colors.    3. Draw them a nice picture about something they both like, or, if you want something for each of them, then draw them both a picture, one for your mom and one for your dad. You can make each drawing something they like.    4. If you want to do something cute, you could write a poem for each of them. You could make it like, "D is for... A is for... D is for..." and vise versa for your mom. That would be a cute idea.    5. If you want to do something a little more "adult", maybe you could try baking them some cookies, and then personalize them, and decorate them with frosting and sprinkles.    6. You could make a fake coupon book for each of your parents. Like, the coupons could say "One free dinner with me." There could be like five coupons per book, or more if you'd like.|`|5AWjZcbRaa	i am making my mom a trivet (pot holder) in my metal shop that is shaped like a heart. find someone who has metal shop in your school if available.|`|9115964b2db13924284e9352d93c154baa	I did this for my mom for mothers day but it can work with both parents.

bK5MJCxhaa	Fabricated letters of reference are very foolish.  I check every reference.  Their deception would be very quickly discovered.    If I were in your position, I would have told my boss that the daughter had a letter of reference with his name on it, and left it to him to handle it.  After all, it's not your problem to address.  It's his.    You have to be very careful only to disclose what you actually know, not what you suspect, and to be very clear about what action is yours to take, and what actions others should take for themselves.    It's time to distance yourself from these people.|`|8e4506c476b48324af970127ad5cd76faa	You have to find that line between being the "accomplice" by not reporting anything even though you know about it, and being the "rat" by reporting things that don't matter and ruining people's careers over trivial things.    Obviously you are operating in a gray area where the answer is not quite clear between which of the two paths is better.  In your case I would say do whichever would advance your career the most, or help you personally the most.  Since it is such a close call which path to take, you should take yourself and your interests into account and decide based on that.  Forget loyalties because the friendship and employer loyalties cancel each other out.|`|9qUnD0sBaa	Wow , that is a problem!  The correct thing to do if you see someone stealing is to alert the authorities. Their kindness to you doesn't make their crime any less. They choice to act the way they did you cant do anything about that .The only person here you need to keep on the right path is you.  If you do the right thing then your job is done.   Whistle blowers are not favored by the public in general because dishonest people don't want to be caught.  The employer that is giving you a job and trusting you to be honest with his money deserves to know that he is being robbed, no less than if a person broke into his home and took his personal belongings.   I might be prejudicial in my answer ,as I employee people and put my trust in them and sometimes they take things from me ,and Im always disappointed and hurt , I am always honest with them.

o0I5YXMNaa	I don't know the answer to your question but you made me think.    On the underground, I put my handbag on my knee so that a black lady could have the room to sit down.  She looked at me, sat down without smiling and moved as far away as she could on the long side seat.    A week or so later, I read a letter where a woman asked why white people moved their bags out of the way of a black person.  She wrote: "do they think I am going to steal from them?"  When I moved my bag that thought never occurred to me at all.    Which leads me to think that sometimes we misunderstand other people's actions.  On the other hand, we may give offense without intending.    Don't give up on being friendly and don't be oversensitive.  I know all my friends and family would sit next to you without hesitation.|`|lynmeenmaa	are u thinking these things while ur on the bus? if so u are probably giving off a serious paranoid vibe , shifty eyes, almost daring people to sit near u?!! haha dont be so worried, when i sit on a bus i dont really pay attention to who i sit next to i prefer to siton my own. get someone u know to smell u just in case! and smile!|`|dPULl5hjaa	That's why people are people!

And this is just in general (no science behind it.)  Women prefer to sit next to women.  Men prefer to sit next to a woman (for fear of being thought of as gay) and will avoid sitting next to another man if at all possible, especially if he has to squeeze between two men (on those bench-like seats).  And everyone (except me) leaves the lone black man until last to sit next to.  Good for me 'cause I can have a seat when everyone else has to stand.  I think it's a blast too when they avoid the black guy and sit next to the anti-social psycho who's going to start yelling at them.      My problem is just the opposite.  The whole train can be empty except for me and someone always (ALWAYS) sits next to me even though there are a whole lot of empty seats elsewhere.  I almost never ever get to have a whole double seat to myself and usually end up with my legs going numb from having to hold my groceries and work I'm lugging around and my lunch and everything else on my lap.  I mean, even when I have some huge ackward box and my shoulder bag full, someone inevitably has to sit next to me and I have to sit with my feet on top of my box and my other luggage in my lap.  There are times I want to say "hell, go sit somewhere else--it's not like there aren't a whole lot of other places to sit.  Why do you always have to sit next to me????"|`|4PQOiSfZaa	I actually prefer to sit alone. I feel more comfortable.

It can be pretty awkward when your taking a route where none of your friends live. They aren't not sitting with you because of the way you look, but because they are accustomed to the same. Same friend, same person, same sea. Everyday. If you want to take the initiative, go up and sit with someone else. Strike conversation. They'll accept you for who your are. Be assertive and don't despair!|`|LFwQPrxbaa	First thing to know is.. it's not about your nose!  Everyone has a some weird "flaw" that they think everyone stares at, but generally speaking, people see the whole picture when they look at you.      Do you ever make eye contact with the people?  Maybe smile or move your things in an effort to "invite" them into that space?  That might make a difference.    Watch others on the bus and see what kind of body language the use to get people to sit next to them.    Good Luck!|`|2ZAzoKfraa	You should be GLAD that you don't have to sit next to anybody on the bus. I always end up having to share the same space with 300+ pounders.|`|KgK8z6tNaa	It could be your cologne. You did say it was one of the finest. And people do tend to like to sit alone or with their friends.|`|lwG6tvOqaa	If there are empty seats on the bus, i would choose to sit in them than to sit by another person unless they are too far in the back of the bus. If they choose to sit by someone else rather than you, and there are plenty of available seats, then there is a problem.    Maybe you look like an intimidating person, and just don't know about it, or maybe they just don't want to sit next to a stranger. Maybe they have heard bad things about you, and automatically want to avoid contact with you. Or maybe you are just riding the bus with people who are just random, and sit wherever.     If i were you, i wouldn't really worry about it, because you seem like a nice guy, and if you are a good person, then one day, someone WILL talk/sit next to you on the bus. Maybe you should take the first step, and talk to them first.|`|IpwsYe2kaa	Some people may actually be intimidated. I feel so uncomfortable if there is only one spot left in the break room or cafeteria when I go to luch during work or school and it's by someone i don't know I like freak. I don't usually sit there still unless I'm like really tired and in a bad mood and I just feel like "say something about it" You know?     I have walked all the way to the break room with my lunch, realized that's there's only one seat and that is' by someone I don't know. and I actually walked all the way back to where I came from to go eat where there's a spot I can eat alone. or with someone I know.     It probably isn't anything personally towards you.

216d90e6aa749da6fe51585ee054ef87aa	The simplest and most effective way to make an introduction is to speak to the more important person first. Example: Grandmother, I would like to introduce you to my friend Jane Everts. Jane, this is my grandmother, Mrs. Smith.    Mr. Client, I would like to introduce you to my manager, Mr. Jones. Mr. Jones, this is Robert Client, Vice President of XYZ Corporation.    Traditionally, in social situations, men are introduced to women.    "Mrs. Barrett, I'd like you to meet Mr. Farnham."    Except for members of your family, no woman is ever presented to a man unless he is:    The head of a country    A member of a royal family    A church official or    An older man in high position, such as a governor.    In business, which is gender neutral, follow the rule of speaking to the more important person first:  Mr. Jones, please meet Ms. Anne Smith. Ms. Smith, this is Mr. Robert Jones, the President of our company.    A younger person is introduced to an older person:    "Professor Johnston, I'd like you to meet my niece, Mary Cox."    "Aunt Ruth, this is my roommate, Mimi Citron."    A person of high rank or special prominence is named first and receives the introduction:    Bishop Gordon, may I present my husband, John?    Outsiders are introduced to family members if they are the same age and rank.    Jeff, Id like you to meet my brother, Steve.    nfd?|`|RWgjnwl9aa	Ans  1 is correct always intrduce the main person first|`|AA10064810	Introduce younger to older, less prominent to more prominent.  Otherwise, just say their names clearly and possibly say who they are.  Mrs. Jones, this is my friend, Johnny...I want you to meet...    Then, don't abandon the new guy to go off to see someone else you know.|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	According to etiquette, you should introduce the elder or "superior" person first:  "Mr. Bossman, I'd like you to meet my new colleague, Ms. Jane Smith.  She'll be doing all my grunt work.  Ms. Smith, Mr. Bossman."    If it's more casual, then you can just go, "hey, Joe, where ya goin with that gun in your hand?  I want you to meet my girlfriend, Jane.  Jane, meet Joe, who's woman been goin out with some other man."

Show me one Rich and Wealthy person that is Really and totally HAPPY with what they have in life,they are always craving for MORE..and that is no good for any person!!!!!xxx|`|NQFV2AdZaa	I believe it's a double edged sword for people with wealth. Of course they can have a lot more material things than poor people, however the downside is that they attract a lot of shallow users, who only like them for their money. I know of an bad mannered, fat, unattractive grandad who has women saying they "love" him because he's rich. It's obvious they'd never look at him twice if he was poor, it's shallow but sadly true. He's never had a long term happy relationship, and doesn't seem to care.|`|B1GjfOUdaa	Money will never buy you happiness but it can certainly make things a lot easier.|`|StRaKUf6aa	I believe that it can't be denied that everyone is born into a particular situation.  Some are born into families where they are capable of earning a hefty inheritance.  Others are born into families that literally have nothing.

That being said, it's not impossible to achieve these things.|`|q0Dg8a1haa	Wealth is meaningless if you're not going to do something useful with it.|`|7DtfYx20aa	i think like you|`|QXhfiYanaa	Money is evil,wealth is not money.|`|AA11598210	~~Anything is possible for anyone if they want it enough.

908baa284d556d80de872cddb6de0ecaaa	I don't know if you an English or foreign, but is a very difficult to learn.  I've always asked myself how it is for children to learn spelling in english    Just the names of the vowels are crazy:  in other languages are so simple  a (sound of  "a" in "car")  e (sound of  "ea" in "dead")  i (sound of  "ea" in "leave)  o (sound of "a" in "watch)  u (sound of "u" in "food")    It's crazy: so many words that is pronounced the same but spelling differently    Spanish is much more easy compared to english or french, tough the grammar is difficult, if a tourist is lost with a guide book, he opens his book read it out and people understand, but in english it is impossible if you don't have an intermediate english level.    Although it would be very difficult to put it easier, because their are many accents in english and any try to approximate spelling and speaking wouldn't satisfy everybody.    English is hard not just because of the spelling, but also of the pronounciation and phrasal verbs...    The words have usually one or two syllables. The words with more syllables comes from French and Latin but are not always used in informal conversation.    But if the beginner learner is in England learning English, I think that they can take advantage from it|`|z6Eqgzpyaa	i didnt think it was very hard just the accents which at time are impossible to interprete if you already know another european language it should be even easier|`|bibIAhN9aa	it depends if your mother tongue is latin based or not. English is difficult for Japanese/Chinese people for example.|`|026ccc37bd36bd551332232d59c0c4a2aa	Any language is difficult to a beginner.|`|GxEjOj02aa	ty|`|UnMLa6r8aa	well i came to the us when i was 5 years old  and only spoke spanish.   I was in full english classes by second grade.   It just depends how quick of a learner you are.    good luck though (:|`|7HMNeRvsaa	Yeah, as a second language it is one of the most difficult ones out there. As it derives it origins from Latin, Anglo-Frisian and Norse it makes it all the harder to learn how to speak, and even harder to write. What's more US English and UK English have different spellings of some words as well. The best thing to do is to keep trying and trying. If you are playing a video game, look at the instruction in your native language and then look at the English section, same with anything that is translated. Same if you are watching a film, get a film you know well and then set the language to English, this is just little things that can help you along.|`|Jwk7Ib2vaa	God yes! For most foreigners, English is one of the hardest dialects of to master. Due to the fact that we have many colloquialisms, different spellings of the same word, and slang terms, it's not terribly simple to get our language down pat.   More power to the immigrants who took the time to learn English, tisk tisk to the ones who won't even try.|`|XAAF7R23aa	why would you ask that question, when it is obviously not a problem for you|`|AaXl3vcCaa	its supposed to be one of the hardest to learn because we have so many words for the same thing and the same word can mean lots off different things, i do not know from experience but know people who have learned it as a secondary language and say  its hard|`|A039XVnJaa	its supposed to be one of the hardest because there are so many different accents.|`|akEA02Ataa	Oh.. gosh...   I am from Korea.   I started to speak English since 2008.  Now, 2009... still difficult when speaking and writing.    One thing I know is it is up to you.  It won't take long if you study Eng hard and make strong efforts to make native friends rather than making those from your own country.    Another way to improve English is to post your journal written English here on Yahoo Answers and you will definitely will be a quick learner of English.    Good luck..|`|gzAjhBeFaa	YES. I've been learning since I was born, and I still find it the most difficult language to master.|`|u25R7XIGaa	It's my first language, but I didn't learn to read until second grade because it's so...

At some point, though, I got a knack to it; possibly because I already speak the language, and after a while you can get a sense of what the word should sound like by what words it's similar to, and what language it's from, etc.|`|hNN2f5Saaa	uh yeah, english is often given the name of the hardest second language to learn    it takes roots from many different languages, and it's sentence structure is unlike most others    i have seen many people attempt to learn english and it is not an easy journey to set upon if you are not up to it    so to answer your question: yes, it is hard, and i have|`|uU9JjX3Iaa	english is usually pretty hard for beginners, sorry to say  my parents are both italian immigrants, and they always say that the hardest part about learning english was that either the same word had very different meanings, and that people generally do not speak perfect english and therefore it is very hard to learn a language that doesn't follow its own rules
aIZfiU6Kaa	The Americans starting with Noah Webster are in my opinion simplifying an extremely complicated English vocabulary, it is much simpler and makes a lot more sense.    I see no reason why the Americans can't change the English language, after all we changed Latin, Greek and French to form our own.    The letter Z for instance can only be pronounced one way as a rule while S can be pronounced in two.    Your example of colour is a good one, the Americans spell it color, what do we want a U in it for? also if we add colour to something we 'colourise' it, the Americans would colorize it, much more sensible and only one way it can be pronounced.|`|b1256d852b56b556e6bb26806d1c64eaaa	Recognise - Recognize  Realise - Realize    It's probably for the same reason they take the letter u out of words like colour, flavour, etc. It's just to stamp their identity on the English language.|`|Ld1vLH8Kaa	Can't think of any|`|7i6qj4OXaa	I just think 'why shouldn't they'.  It's their way of separating from English rule.|`|GO7tZtPxaa	Yeah! I've always wondered that, Im afraid I have no idea. Maybe their attempt to make the language more their own??

Try to say it with an s at the end- doesnt it sound awkward?|`|WEEIySqRaa	During the revolutionary war, the "Americans" changed their language to differentiate themselves from the British. They wanted to have nothing in common with the British. Same reason the Australians and Irish developed their own accents. Both the Irish and Australian accents were developed within the last 100 years to separate themselves from the Brits.     Interestingly enough, towards the end of WWII, after the British and Americans fought along side each other and the Allied force eventually won the war, the British accent made a huge comeback in the USA - everyone wanted to talk like them.|`|de0824ae062901a9dca5250dad4a5072aa	Noah Webster compilled a dictionary of English in 1806 in which he changed the spelling of many words in order for them to be easier to spell. Therefore the "s" in many words that really sounds like ''z" was changed e.g. "realise" vs "realize".     He also changed many words containing  the "ou" combination to "o" e.g. "colour"= "color".     There are various other "american spellings" similar to these for the same reason.    Because the dictionary became so popular the spelling of the words changed for the people using the dictionary (American people).     Its very annoying when you're using microsoft word and its telling you your words are spelt wrong!|`|VUdaZUpwaa	Hi,     Typical such words are organize, recognize, realize (all USA spellings.).  As you may know, Noah Webster made most of the spelling changes from English to American English.  He reportedly made the changes --according to him--for logical and esthetic reasons.  As I understand it, both the Greek and Latin base words had the -ize spelling.   I further understand that the   -ise of the British spelling comes from a French rendering of the base word.  Webster said that both etymologically and phonetically -ize  was better.  So, he changed the -ise spelling to -ize.  Webster was a very clever guy, so if you plan to challenge him, you're dealing wit
2gyJUTzRaa	pro-life legally means you want abortion to be illegal.  i think "pro-life" is an ironic term...it should be "anti-choice" because most people who are pro choice still are opposed to abortion, they just think the woman should get to choose.    and to the fundie above me...look at the countries where abortion is illegal - all of them are 3rd world hell holes.  this should say something about the mentality (or lack there of) about people who are anti-choice.  i'm assuming you're uneducated, and i'm not being stereotypical...if you look at demographics, pro choice people are, in general, more educated than those who think abortion should be illegal.  same with pro-gay marriage, and pro-keeping religion out of schools.  you're rediculous middle aged mentality is getting smaller and smaller among the general public, thanks to education.  please, learn something.    and i hate when people equate "pro-choice" to "pro-abortion".....i mean seriously only sociopaths are "pro-abortion"|`|mMo2hwUBaa	Most Pro-lifers, know that before Roe, abortions were performed on rape victims etc. on request.  It was listed as a simple D&E, or D&C.  They used to do alot of these.  But not for routine birth control.    The problem with a time frame is where do we draw the line.  And what about for sex selection, eye color, skin color.  What if suddenly we decide Hitler was right?  If we declare someone non-human (which is what Roe vs. Wade decide re: the unborn) then what if we decide as Hitler did that Jews are not Human, or Asian, or Caucasians, or black or fill in the blank with your own race.  Remember, in Germany it wasn't a crime to kill a Jew, because they were officially sub-human.    We feel it is of the utmost importance to speak for those who have no voice.  If the unborn could vote, how do you think they would vote.  We as Republicans spoke for the slaves when they had no voice, women when they had no voice and now the unborn.  Someone has to speak for those who the government and the hate mongers refuse a voice.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	In cases of incest and rape, I do not think that God would require such a victim to deliver and raise the child UNLESS OF COURSE SHE ELECTED TO.

Trying to stop other women from having the option is ridiculous..|`|9961a4fda02d0241974fd4e74d5ad8aeaa	There seems to be a lot varience in the pro-lifers.  I've heard some pro-lifers who apply their principles only to themselves and think the option should be left open for others to decide on their own.  On the other opposite pole, I've also heard some pro-lifers say abortion should be completely banned unless the mother's life is clearly in danger and then those who would have or carry about illegal abortions should be prosecuted as murderers.  And then there's there a large middle ground with people disagreeing on how situations affected by rape, age, mental illness, poverty etc. should be handled.|`|bOiAHI8paa	i think it should be absolutely illegal|`|ypVQlOJvaa	I am pro-life, but feel the option should be left open.

IJR feels that abortion, when used solelyy as a method of birth control, is nothing short of legalized murder andshouldd be outlawed.  Other casesshouldd be judged on the merits of each case, not by somegovernmentall standard.|`|Rn4GXoJAaa	In the case of rape, as terrible as rape is, the baby is not the one to blame or punish. Punish the rapist.    An unborn child is a human being, with its own DNA. It should be protected at all costs, just as it is after birth.     However, I understand that laws must change slowly, and any law that gets us closer to zero aboritions gets my vote.    If the mother's life is literally in danger, and a doctor can varify that birth will kill her, maybe that would be a POSSIBLE exception, but only if there is truly no way to save both lives. Only because I could not ask someone to die, that would make me a major hypocrite.      Edit: Yes I have heard it called "Pro-death" but i have also heard people use the term "anti-choice", including my local newspaper. Word games are on both sides. Words are powerful. Knowledge is more powerful yet.    And yes Angela, I would be delighted to talk about this if you want.

Your position -- pro-choice but anti-abortion -- is rather nonsensical, I am afraid. Do you think it's a human life if a person was careless about birth control, but not a human life if the fetus was conceived in rape? That's just ridiculous. If it's wrong for the careless teen to abort and right for the careless teen to have the baby and put him/her up for adoption, then the same goes for ALL unwanted pregnancies.     Also, your time frame suggeston is equally nonsensical. Do you suggest that the human fetus is not human before some point in time, such as the 12th week of pregnancy, but magically becomes human after that point? Science says otherwise -- science says the fetus is human all along.|`|AoACu48daa	We already do limit the time frame, and few if any people who are pro-choice have a problem with that.    That problem is the nutters who believe that life begins at conception; as if a clump of cells in a test-tube somehow has the same merits as a living breathing person.    The difficulty comes in determining at what point between clump and person rights should be granted. I think we have a pretty good happy-medium right now.|`|bK5MJCxhaa	Here's an interesting article on the subject entitled "The Only Moral Abortion is My Abortion".|`|TSCfQTw3aa	There are no 'moral excuses' for murder. Murder is murder no matter what spin you put on it. (Rape/Incest make up for less than 2% of all abortions.) There should not be a choice. We don't justify murders in our criminal system when the victims are outside the womb, but somehow we justify them if the victim is completely defenseless. There is no appropriate 'time frame' for an abortion. A human being is a human being no matter what age they are.|`|NI0cNU22aa	I support banning abortion except in cases where the pregnancy would endanger the woman's health (I believe the psychological ramifications of rape and incest fall under this category) and comprehensive sex ed. The kids who are going to have sex are going to do it whether or not the school teaches them about pregnancy prevention, and the kids that aren't going to have sex won't suddenly decide to because they learned about it in school.

Yes, I understand that rape is a horrible, horrible, horrible act, but that does not take away from the birth of a child.  Sure, I understand that the woman may not want a constant reminder that her child is half the product of a man that she did not love.  But on the flip side, she needs to realize that the other half of the child is her as well. So to kill a child, is killing part of yourself as well.    On a continuing note, pro-choice and pro-life cannot logically co-exist.  There is too much grey area in a situation like that.  A teen could be irresponsible and then turn around to say it was rape.  What happens then?  Hence, Pro-Life constituents must be on one side, and one side only....    Respecting life, from conception to natural death.|`|AA11466759	the reason this issue is so difficult is because of all the gray areas of our world.

6064bd72a9d33a8f2e618cc79b0f9629aa	Scientology, which questionably calls itself a new "religion", is the brainchild of 1950s science fiction writer & occult enthusiast L. Ron Hubbard. The organization, by means of Hubbards self created psychotherapy technique called Dianetics, claims to be able to help rid members of any & all mental constraints including but not limited to emotional scarring (from this & "past" lives) due to "engrams" (past negative experiences stored in our unconscious mind), psychological disorders & chemical imbalances (the solution is to convince members that these things don't actually exist) & drug dependence (including legally prescribed psychopharmaceuticals which counteract the effects of psychological disorders Scientologists believe to be nonexistent). Their treatment of substance abuse includes little more than massive, often dangerous doses of vitamins and unhealthy extended sessions in a sauna.   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dianetics S...   Dianetics review: http://dir.salon.com/story/books/review/...   http://www.time.com/time/magazine/articl...   http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Narconon/deto...   http://www.nypress.com/20/22/news&column...     Scientology is most certainly NOT a religion. In fact, one of the only reasons they enjoy "tax exempt status" on religious ground in the United States is because they bullied the IRS into a "deal" through extremely aggressive barratry (which is the offense of persistently instigating groundless lawsuits) against said government agency & its officials, & arranged to drop all 2,500 frivolous lawsuits only when an "agreement" was reached. In addition, Scientology's lawyers hired private investigators to dig up any "dirt" on IRS agents which was then used to blackmail or publicly smear all "vulnerable" agents. It was an all-out WAR that Scientology had waged against the IRS, & was even described as such by Scientology's "CEO", David Miscavige, in his 1993 speech to the International Association of Scientologists.   http://legalminds.lp.findlaw.com/list/fe...   http://www.lermanet.com/scientologynews/...   http://www.factnet.org/headlines/give-aw...   http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Cowen/essays/...    The official Scientology organization is composed of a number of levels. One begins as a preclear & works their way up. One must purchase virtually every service crucial to advancement directly from the "church" & at staggering prices. "Auditing", for example, is purchased in 12? hour blocks, costing anywhere from $200-$750 for introductory sessions to between $8,000 & $9,000 for advanced sessions. Basically, Scientology claims to possess exclusive knowledge of the path to religious redemption & then charges obscene amounts of money for every tiny incremental step towards this end. Visit this link to see how $380,000 is a conservative estimate for the total cost of moving all the way up the Scientology hierarchal ladder:  http://www.xenu.net/archive/prices.html   These are the total costs for auditing alone:   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientology...   Heres an explanation of what auditing is:   http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...     At level OT III (Operating Thetan Level 3), some very strange & fiercely guarded secrets are imparted upon worthy members who have paid enough money to advance to such a level (and no, this isn't a joke): The evil alien ruler Xenu killed millions of aliens (Thetans) from around the universe by kidnapping them, bringing them to earth in golden DC-8 space-planes, stacking them around volcanoes & blowing them up by dropping h-bombs into the volcanoes. Scientologists believe the souls of these aliens (these souls are "Body Thetans") were captured, brainwashed & released; they then attached themselves to our ancestors (and according to Scientologys belief in Thetan immortality, they also attached to us during past lives) & cause many of our mental & physical ills to this day.

Financially and mentally, you belong to them.|`|0bYcYz2jaa	From what I've seen and heard about it, it is NOT a religion and they do not encourage either recruiting (like Jehovah's Witnesses) or ascribing to any religion while you are a member.  It was created by a Sci-Fi writer, who says some of us are higher life-forms (aliens) trapped in human forms until the mothership comes for those lucky few.  Oh, and they prefer to recruit celebrities and the wealthy.  The poor are not restricted, just not encouraged.    EDIT:  I visited some of Dreamstuff's links.  Holy Crap!!! These people are scarier than I thought!!|`|D1BNSf5uaa	It's not very specific. Try the website. It somewhat explains.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	STAY AWAY FROM THESE PEOPLE.    It's an evil cult designed to make money and nothing else . Its effects on believers are destructive - Check out a partial list of victims: http://whatstheharm.net/scientology.html    Please read about:    * Its blatantly illegal and immoral activities, as illustrated by Operation Snow White and Operation Freakout.  * Its "fair game" policy of harassing and destroying critics, as illustrated by the stories of Keith Henson, Frank Oliver and Paulette Cooper  * Its fatal abuse of its members, including Lisa McPherson, Heribert Pfaff, Josephus Havenith, and others  * Its brutal, illegal treatment of members who the Church considers in need of rehabilitation or punishment using private prisons  * Its tax-exempt status in the United States, which was gained by blackmailing the IRS  * Its practice of breaking up families.    Read "the road to xenu" for an account of a girl who escaped scientology after 12 years!  http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Library/Shelf...    The cult's core belief is that we are all reincarnated aliens, and all of our problems are because of other alien souls haunting our bodies. That's the big secret - but it's only revealed to scientologists after many years and over $300,000 - so most of them have no knowledge of it. Read the alien story yourself - in Hubbard's own handwriting: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/OTIII/    Everything about scientology is dishonest, from recruiting gullible folk using fake "personality tests", through collecting dirt on individuals using "auditing" in case they ever want to leave, to claiming everybody who criticizes them is a criminal, probably a child molester.

Dianetics is a technology developed by Ron Hubbard to free a person from automatic reactions coming from the unconscious mind.     Anyone can be a Scientologist (one who practices Dianetics) Agnostics are perfect for being a Scientologist because you're open enough to learn what they teach. Theist are good, too, because in Scientology personal beliefs in God is left up to the individual. Scientology doesn't dictate what you believe.  One of Scieintology's tenets is "what is true for you, is true for you", so they would never invalidate whatever you believed.|`|gOKi1dcVaa	A scam|`|esqt7P9saa	Crap|`|Wo5ztzzvaa	Another christian-based delusion|`|Dea2ZJyAaa	Stupid crap. Gotta pay like 1000 bucks to get in.  Plus, according to them, evil aliens can sneak in through your butt crack and possess you.|`|wB3AbJyLaa	Allow me to display some brief history. We're talking about a fairly simple history here. L. Ron Hubbard was a guy who wrote some really popular books, magazine articles, and movie scripts. He wrote a lot of different topics because he traveled all over the world and saw all kinds of interesting things. You've heard of the lowest common denominator in math, right? Well, that's what he was looking for, but in people. Everywhere he went he tried to figure out what connected people, what about them was the same. Scientology at its best is a self-help religious system. In 1938 he wrote a book called "Excalibur" that was never published. But while he was writing it, he got his idea from another book, "Dianetics" which he wrote in 1950. With this book his ideas gained popularity, and people started believing what he wrote. In 1951, he founded Scientology as a religious philosophy. The first Scientology church was formed in 1954 in Los Angeles. Scientology means knowing how to know. In case you haven't noticed, I just answered your question right there. Here's the scoop, according to L. Ron. You are a spiritual being. Basically good, not a sinner by nature. You have a mind and you have a body, but they are separate from the spiritual part of you. See? The spirit. The way the see in Scientology is that there is this spiritual life force, known as Thetan, that is in all living things. And the ultimate goal of all life for all beings is to survive eternity. There are eight ways, called channels, you can do this: Through your individuality, your family, groups, mankind, all living things, the physical universe, spirits, and God. Check how they get bigger as you go, from you up to the Universe. The best way to survive is to do the most good for as many of these dynamics, or relationships, as you can. Okay. That was the spirit. Got it? Now let's look at the mind. The mind is a recorder. They believe it keeps track of all the good and bad moments from this life and all your past lives. So, your mind is keeping track of all this stuff and, like a good mystery novel, give clues, these recordings, to figure out what's wrong with your spirit. Your mind also records painful moments in your unconscious mind, called engrams, problems you didn't know you had. These engrams or spiritual growth can mess up your thinking at nay time, kind of like a computer virus. Auditor, people who listen, help you find and understand these traumas by using this thing called an E-meter. It's kind of similar to visiting a shrink. They believe you'll be a lot happier when you get rid of this engrams and live life without their side effects. God exist but His identity is a matter of personal awareness and conviction. Jesus was one of many great teachers. You're on a search to understand yourself, others, life and God. Your job is also to help others and make the world a better place. Scientology churches are places where people get together to study and receive counseling. Scientologists are actively involved in their communities through things like drug rehabilitation, park cleanups, revitalizing neighborhoods, fighting AIDS and more. Remember, their philosophy is that to survive for eternity you have to help out as much as you can.|`|bTh3NNpSaa	Scientology is a cult made by a sci fi writer. And once you join that's it they'll never leave you alone if you get out of it some way they'll start spreading lies about you. They're a group of people you don't want to mess with. If you want any info to get an Idea on what they believe just Research it on wikipedia click on all the words in blue and read the essay about it and then click those blue words. Also look on youtube for the BBC special panorama me and scientology ep. Hope this helps.|`|GqEqFSdpaa	I'm not a Scientoligist. But know more about the tech then I ever wanted to learn. Every thing I'm writting is true and what happened to me at one of there rehabs called NARCONON.    Scientology has nothing to do with Religion or Science. It is a Scam and a Cult!    It is a bunch of twisted facts and some bull crap tech on how man should live his life. Their idea of Ethics is nothing as you and I would want to follow.    They believe that any problem you have from a bad marriage to drug addiction can be cured by their tech. This includes getting a better job and coming out of a deep depression. They claim to fix it by using the same tech on everyone.    Here is a one of their dangerous beliefs:    They believe that "All illnesses to a greater or lesser degree and all fowl ups stem directly and only from what they call a PTS (Potential Trouble Source) condition." To be PTS means you are being supressed by an SP. An SP (Supressive Person). 1)So if you get sick they believe that it is caused by an SP, find out who the SP is and dissconect from that person and you will not be ill. You will not need a doctor or meds.2) Let say you work for them. You are driving one of their cars. You back up and hit something like a pole that was out of your veiwing range. This fowl up has been caused because you are PTS.Not because you just couldn't see it. Now you are put in one of their conditions. This would probably be The Condition of Treason. Treason definition: Betrayal after trust. They trusted you to drive the car and not hit a pole. You are now going to be put on an ethics cycle and relearn what you already paid for them to teach you. Manual labor and humilation. That's only part of the proccess to get back into their good graces.      Then the higher levels are right out of there founding fathers (LR Hubbard) Sci FI books. In order to learn that stuff you must pay lot of money to go through the classes to tell you this crazy secret.    Never take one of there personality test. That is how they tell you what is wrong in your life. A 200 question personality test that everyone takes. Same test for every problem. It is a money making scam that will turn you into a penniless cult member    I was scamed into one of their drug rehabs(NARCONON). They took   $ 30,000 from me and my family. They told me my family disowned me and I tried to killmy self three months later. My family loves me now and always have. Stay away from these people|`|2RzyYh0Paa	ill tell u what it isnt....many people have the rong idea of what scientology is and they beleive that it is about aliens and xenu which is not true...i have scientologist firends who dont beleive in this at all...personally if that was true id think that was pretty weird and creepy as well,,, but people seem to be illinformed by the media who critisize it.....scientology is not something to fear and nobody has any proof to say that it is about aliens......  i think u should pick a few things about scientology that u do not like and ask yourself where u got that information from because u may be misinformed......the media have made up stuff, critised it and put it down for years

By then, you should be able to tell them you have a problem with it anyways.     Here's a another option, ask them to give you a call when they get there. Or vice versa, tell them you'll call when your at the front of the house.|`|rThIVk2maa	Yes, it's rude. I would let him know not to do it again.

I mean its kinda inconsiderate, considering ringing the doorbell is much more appropriate. Its kinda rude but if yall were in a rush or something it woulda been okay, like if this is anywhere beyond your 5th date its okay but if it was your first date, not so much, because the guy wants to make a good impression.|`|SsB7aRExaa	Yes.  It's disrespectful.  If you have to convince him of this, don't.  Move on.|`|dPULl5hjaa	Rude - doesn't cover it.  Guess his parents didn't teach him any manners!    Flat out tell him:  I would appreciate if you would come to the front door.  If he should look at you perplexed, then he's a jerk and should be dumped!|`|vs5rK3iRaa	As the father of a teenage daughter, I would consider it extremely rude.  I would not allow my daughter to go out to the car if that happened, and I might even not allow her to go out with that boy at all, at least for that night.|`|AA10241709	Yes, very rude.|`|4PQOiSfZaa	Yes, to me that is rude. It's kind of like saying "hurry up!"|`|03e31964ea48bacd64475706a14630b1aa	No. I don't think it's rude at all.

You should definitely not do this, especially if you and your date are in high school, whereas many parents despise this practice.  Besides, being willing to come to the door and meet the parent(s) really quick before going out (if she still lives at home) is a good gesture.|`|Eoshn4pyaa	Yes. That is extremely rude for a date to do. Now, if y'all were carpooling to work and you were running late, I understand. But if you are dating, that is not acceptable.|`|AA10064810	Yes, absolutely unless you are both 16 and you can see the car from your living room window.

If those who work and pay the bulk of the taxes (low and middle classes) can support the country why would they want to change it to have to put their own money to support us.  Everyone thinks that only Republicans want to keep their money, the truth is that the Democratic party is supported by plenty of wealthy people who don't pay taxes too.  At least the Republicans view holds that if you can make it you can keep it.  Democrats don't want you to make it too well, if you did, you wouldn't be relying on the government so much and they wouldn't be able to control what you can and cannot do.|`|RKhSRMlZaa	Obama never claimed to want to socialize the United States nor did democrats.|`|ZN5nkM0waa	2012 FEMA CAMPS, HAARP, RFID CHIP, NWO!!!

Shall I go through the republicans in congress who've had tax problems and had to pay back taxes and penalties?  Or can you accept my stipulation that taxes are complicated, and lots of folks screw up?    Nevertheless, yes -- it is a bit embarrassing.

The past & future are unknown to us but the scientists are proving that they know something about that.

A fact is a proven conclusion that any unknown things does exists. Ask this yourself: Do I have a spirit?  And can you prove that?
AA10625552	I don't think that you should "strive" to get a boyfriend by Christmas.  You might end up getting desperate by the time Fall rolls around, and end up with someone that's a real jerk, then you'd be worse off than you were before.  Just be yourself, and if that special someone comes along, then it was meant to be.  If not, then it wasn't.  Surround yourself with friends and try not to feel sorry that you don't have a boyfriend.|`|VBeFzAV1aa	yes|`|8Ddb4OQfaa	hey whats stopping you|`|0bc986861c0e5afae15d606bc6b9fbc4aa	Boy friends are not just for Christmas.

PBYYIl9Maa	I'm a pro-life, pro-choice, anti-capital punishment, anti-war Christian. I don't think we should kill anyone, BUT I also don't think people should divorce. However, I DO think America is free and we should have to right to disagree. If someone wants to terminate a pregnancy, and it's legal, go for it. At least it's safe. I wouldn't do it, but I don't judge others. This is also why I am a democrat.|`|8e4506c476b48324af970127ad5cd76faa	Not to mention they elected a guy who was borderline retarded.  AND he didn't even get rid of abortion like they wanted!|`|mMo2hwUBaa	Not to be condescending, but without the Holy Spirit dwelling within a person, it is impossible to understand the Christian perspective.  The Bible says that the Gospel and the cross is foolishness to those who perish, but the power of God to those who believe.    So, what seems perfectly logical to a believer is not perceptible to the non-believer.  You have reasoned from the non-believer perspective all your life.  Why not accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour, be born from above by the spirit of God, and then afterwards, if you don't begin to understand, leave the faith.  But I have never known a true believer, born from above who ever left.   And for the record, there are no innocents.|`|HdmlZdyHaa	We believe in saving innocent lives. Well at least I do.  To me people getting the death penalty they are guilty, they chose to kill a kid or someone. Fetuses don't have a choice over anything. Shouldn't we at least give them a chance like we gave the convict who got on probation 3 or 4 times.|`|l1ctIW7eaa	seperate issues, stop putting them together|`|eAMq1iBWaa	National self defense is absolutely necessary. Abortion on the other hand is murder in the name of convenience. God will avenge.    BTW what is the difference between a woman having a partial birth abortion (all but the head delivered) and a woman that delivers the child and then promptly stabs it to death? In the second case she is guilty of  murder so why not in the first case?    So what's the difference? Th emotive? The means? the reason? WHAT?|`|78a004f4953e767d0c2c36ffd1bf1c39aa	Well, actually no one is innocent in the eyes of God.  But, to get back on target.  The President has to look after the common good of the Country and if their moral convictions get in the way they should not be in the Presidency.  We understand that "innocent" life can be lost in war.  It is the casual killing of babies because they are inconvenient and the parties involved, for the most part, did not take the necessary precautions to avoid the condition.|`|LnoyylQ7aa	sure...    ok    1. one dead fetus or 1 starving child, take your pick  2. one dead fetus or 1 unloved child, take your pick  3. you can proberly see where this is going so i won't say another 3 or 4 of these  4. can you plz define when life actually starts? cause no one has a firm answer  5. nuclear weapons (or at least i think this is what your going on about) are a deterrent, and very good at that, they have stopped a few bad wars expanding.  6. if you are talking about capital punishment its a great deterrent (sometimes) and they made a choice to comit a crime|`|B667elmWaa	Hummm ..... I see what you mean!|`|Y3Z6B7dHaa	"almost instantly kill every person on this planet" no way. it would take at least 45 min to launch nukes, and way longer than instantly to kill every person on earth.|`|lh8Tn02Naa	The conventional answer to this is that the threat to kill millions (with nukes) is made so that it never has to be carried out; but the fear that it MIGHT be carried out prevents war. The theory is that therefore the "deterrent" protects innocent lives.    I happen not to believe this, and from some of his pronouncements it sounds as if Obama doesn't either.  But unfortunately, abortions get carried out regardless, so your parallel is not all that strong.    I'm a pro-choicer who would like to see abortion rates come down drastically. I'm also a nuclear pacifist ....|`|NLinPsyhaa	First of all, your talking of M.A.D. Mutually Assured Destruction. I don't want to know how many times we came to nuclear war during the cold war, but it didn't happen because both sides knew all would die. There would be no winner. With abortion, there is only one loser, the child.    The second failure of your question is that nuclear arms were for defense of this country. Even when they were used against Japan, it was to defend and save American lives. It was estimated that to take one of the islands of Japan, it would have cost more American lives than the entire World War Two conflict.    Your argument could work if the fetus were able to defend itself. But they can't so someone has to protect them.|`|ebbe742a1d8629f5a2fa4466f3367c64aa	In my personal opinion killing someone in battle in the defense of our country, although regrettable, is nowhere near as ludicrous as the idea of killing an infant before he/she is even born (unless an abortion would save the mother's life).     By the way, more people have been killed from abortion than from the war.|`|nT0w6VIKaa	Sorry, but your 'accepted point' isn't a 'given'...and you're comparing apples and breadsticks again...|`|71c6c3d26be7dbca2bd5e204e344e5f6aa	That's a very convoluted supposition.  Leaders are voted in based on their percieved ability to run the country, and not based on their ability to destroy the world or increase the body count.  Leaders diverge from the popular political platform as soon as they take office....what they say to get elected is meaningless in the light of what they actually do.  Point is...the votes go to the person with the most charisma and promising the most gifts in return for your vote, not to the person who will ''instantly kill every person''  - I have never seen that included in any political platform.  The killing of babies is a 'local' issue, and one that we pretend the elected officials will resolve to the satisfaction of the majority.  Both camps of this issue are passionate about their beliefs...with one side trying to protect those who cannot protect themselves, while others wish to exterminate the innocent before they can voice their choice.  Ironically, those who wish to terminate fragile innocent lives are the same people who would protest against, say, Russia, exterminating them with nukes in ''an instant'' -  their life would be gone without any choice in the matter...and they dont like that idea now, do they.

But, I think it's way too expensive.

I mean if we were in the class room and our teacher were to ask Sally a question Jimmy is not suppose to answer.|`|OT4SrmDXaa	Yes they are sicking, I like the oens that say they know what the scripture means when they reject it. They are the worst.|`|AA11124121	Since there is a lack of a guiding force in their lives..they leave life to chance.    Do i type? do i not type.   Do i make a point?  Do i type gibberish.    I think the 3rd is probably more to the   "cause and effect" cycle I've just heard here.    More "dude-where's my atheistic car-isms" spoken here.|`|WRyHOEjSaa	> You yell at us to leave you alone and we're wrong and blah blah blah.  But you're sharing what you believe just as much as us.    So you really dont see any difference between offering ones opinion on a public forum, versus  door to door proselytizing and governmental enforcement of religious rules? Really?    > I think it's unfair that you think we shouldn't be able to share the word of God but you can attack Christians saying THERE IS NO GOD!    Ive yet to see anyone say you cant share the word of God here. I have seen people claim youve done so poorly or in a way that makes no sense, and Ive seen people disagree that there is in fact a God whose word you are sharing.  Its not an attack to say There is no God.  Its an honest opinion, and its as least as valid as your opinion to the contrary.|`|QYu8KrXTaa	Hi, I'm Christian and I like Cyanide's answer. It's by presenting views that we learn. But I see some Bible critics never learn. They still bring up the flat earth and unicorns accusation against the Bible. This has been answered so many times but I'll repeat it. The Bible never teaches a flat earth and unicorns was the best known word when the KJV was translated and has been corrected in most new translations. Likewise for most of the other Bible criticisms.So please don't blame the Bible for what religious people have said. Read it yourself and get it right. nev r|`|gOKi1dcVaa	Because you guys type too slow?|`|gD86SIWeaa	hi five sista.|`|GW8LVWT8aa	Why so serious?    The difference is that Atheists don't take offense when you say there is a god but Christians take offense when atheists say that there is no god.    Why are you so defensive?|`|Agl9ZpnEaa	This is so true.  It's a one way street with some people.  They can give the criticism but can't take it.  I think subconciously it's because they think they might be wrong and they have to come up with an answer.  I'm not real sure, but good point!|`|i46ta7ygaa	because theyre loud mouths|`|X5quBhTHaa	Its a matter of difference of opinion between people who are passionate about their opinions. You're asking questions about religion, and no matter what religion you subscribe to (or don't subscribe to) there will be people that passionately disagree with you and stand eager to express their views. It works both ways.|`|9dOfxwuIaa	There is no god.|`|Dea2ZJyAaa	Well they don't scream at us, because we cannot hear them. But you do have a point. Because most "atheists" on this site are dumb-@$$ twelve year olds.|`|x3ZpztsVaa	"...You yell at us to leave you alone..."    Do we??|`|2OmvzvLoaa	I think the only reason why Atheists are so quick to respond is because it has been 4000 to 5000 thousand years since the beginning of christianity and I guess Atheists feel like ....That's enough.  I mean Christians just want everyone to believe that Jesus is Magic...Walks on water, turns water into wine, raises the dead, makes blind people see and all that junk and Atheists want everyone to believe that there is no god and life has no spiritual afterlife and everything is about the facts.  Well,  I think no one is right.  No one is wrong.  If you really sit down and think about it, What would you rather believe, the things you see and hear with your own eyes and ears or do you want to believe that some cosmic Jewish guy named Jesus came to earth through some virgin's birth canal to save us of from some "original sin" curse that is somehow inherent in all humans because some rib woman named Eve was tricked by a talking snake to eat some fruit from a tree.  Then they kill this guy Jesus and he turns into a zombie (cuz he comes back to life) then he floats off into the sky and now everyone is waiting for him to come back?  Hmmmmm  Honestly, what makes more sense?  Who's word would you believe more? Chris Angel or Albert Einstein.|`|TLLklriUaa	Actually the last question I answered directed at Christians in here was one about a confirmation name.    I gave her the names and bios of three saints I thought would be of interest to her.    If I know the answer to a question, I answer it. I really don't care who it is directed to.|`|l1ctIW7eaa	disagreement is not an attack    also, most of us don't do that.  This question could easily be turned around and asked about the Christians.  So I guess to answer your question:    it's just human nature          EDIT:  look I'm right! Morganie was first....ha|`|lXu5cJd1aa	It's not hypocritical. You christians want to make laws based on values the bible teaches and you want to teach your religion in school when it isn't the only religion out there.     You're complaining about us throwing our opinions out on an online Q&A program?|`|M5XjqI40aa	Because it's a free country.    And there is no God.|`|IdlaZQ8Jaa	the entire world is calling for religious freedom and religious tolerance.  Why are atheist so dead set on prohibiting (specifically christians) rights to freedom of religion and speech?|`|tl2pMkOcaa	It's called snatching the seed before it has a chance to grow.    Hey!|`|NlzlBV8Haa	It's called snatching away the seed before it has a chance to grow.|`|lVSDB0Hwaa	THERE IS NO GOD!|`|LnoyylQ7aa	fastest fingers in the west|`|ViZH5twNaa	Your argument is invalid. As proof I offer the first poster of this question. Good day.    *edit*  "Atheists take offense when someone says there is a God."    1) Really? I have never met one that dose. Do you think I take offense when people say unicorns exist, or bigfoot?     2) Don't capitalize atheists. It isn't a proper noun.|`|WF085j2Daa	because christians are slow|`|ridu0Rtwaa	Open your eyes!!  Read your own post!!    Ask yourself why it is only Christians that get attacked and not the other religions?!!!!    Do you not recognise that Christians are provoking retaliation and repudiation for their terrible attitudes?!!    Perhaps if Christians stopped their intolerant, egotistical, hate filled and bigoted postings things might change!!     Perhaps if Christians stopped eschewing education, science, evolution works of fiction and much, much more things might change!!     Perhaps if Christians stopped being the only religion opposing human rights and persecuting gays, pro choice and so much more things might change!!     Perhaps if Christians stopped demanding freedom of religion whilst they deny it to all non Christians and persecute them things might change!! !!!    If Christians rediscovered the god of love and forgiveness and put aside all those terrible human emotions things would definitely change!!!!    Why are Christians so afraid of people who simply do not believe in any god?!!!! Surely it can only be because they are so afraid that atheist are right and they are wrong or it would not bother them!!!!!!    As soon as Christians rediscover the loving god and start acting like it the problem will cease!!!!|`|1TYZDRUqaa	IJr doesn't tell Christians to leave IJR alone, all IJR asks is for Christians to stop preaching at him.  Expressing an opinion is a good thing.  This is a public forum, and no matter who you address your question to, everyone can, and does, answer.  You want a private answer, use email.

My wife finally understands that the lack of flowers and other items on that particular day does not mean a lack of devotion.  The day a bunch of candy, flowers and pink card stock means more to her than my undying devotion 24/7 is the day we go our separate ways.  Besides she has control of all the money if she wants something before the sales she can go get it with my blessings.|`|ebbe742a1d8629f5a2fa4466f3367c64aa	Probably watch chick flicks with my friends..erm...spiritually speaking. :)|`|esqt7P9saa	absolutely nothing.|`|0DlCIjmcaa	valentines day is scary!|`|Ynsow6qbaa	My wife|`|M2VneBW3aa	Spiritually speaking, nothing.|`|bK5MJCxhaa	Kill my husband if he spends a lot of money on flowers.    |`|ttCkz39aaa	I am gong to massacree some mafia folks|`|Lk4aCBACaa	Spiritually speaking, on Valentine's Day I honor Ares & Aphrodite and Eros & Psyche.

yzgS5KiQaa	I don't know about physically dangerous. But you should not date someone who is incomplete, and hates themselves. Always stay away from people who can't (or I should say won't) accept themselves, love themselves, make themselves happy, make themselves complete. Because if you do date them, they will expect You to do it for them, it's not pretty.|`|HH90Eghaaa	In most cases no, however there is a possibility!

HGadAqG9aa	Jesus is omniscient because he is God. John 1:1, Rev 19:13.|`|AA10493307	The Father created beings called watchers, for the purpose of monitoring the activities of the human trainees.  They report back what they see.      Daniel 4:17|`|A01w1dHqaa	He got that ability after ascension.  That's what it means to be at the right hand of God, everywhere in His consciousness.|`|4sUek7ugaa	Wait - so he became a deity after ascension?    Christianity makes less and less sense the more you hear about it.  I swear you guys just make it up as you go along - every time some contradiction is brought up, you make something up to answer it, doesn't matter how far-fetched it is.|`|AA11002471	Jesus is not omniscient.|`|d28818ca3ea9f1e4bc17f8831d8f7ff8aa	The word I is very emphatic. Jesus will personally search the hearts of the people at Thyatira. The word searches expresses an accurate tracking down of who the person is.    The word minds literally means kidney. The ancients viewed feelings and emotions as abiding in the kidneys. Jesus searches emotions. Emotions are not the primary means of spirituality except as manifestations of the spirituality that is already there. Great spiritual blessing cannot help but flow into the soul. However, that emotion is not spirituality per se.|`|WJqL8Tglaa	Mary fed him the information like Peter Popoff's wife did to him.

He can because He is the Son of God? perhaps?|`|EFjrJmdXaa	Well to be omniscient means to have total knowledge. Searching someones mind is more psychic. It is very possible that Jesus can read peoples thoughts and feelings. I am not saying that I believe that for a fact just offering up possibilities.|`|QYu8KrXTaa	Hi, Jesus is the eternal WORD who became God in the flesh. So Iainiebs this is nothing new. It is original Bible truth. New strange ideas come and go but basic Christianity has not changed. So He knows our thoughts. In Matthew it says a day is coming when all our secrets will be shouted from the housetops. Our only hope is when we accept him as saviour all that is erased from us and transferred to Him. We receive His righteousness. This is the only way to be accepted by the Holy God. nev r
Mnm35sjNaa	EVERYBODY believes what they want to believe.  It's called free will.    It's interesting that, as children, we recognize at an early age that supernatural entities like Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy and magical unicorns are all nonsense.  Yet, so many adults cling to supernatural beings (God) and places (heaven) and books (scripture) -- despite the lack of any evidence whatsoever.    The question isn't, "Do you believe?" -- it's "Do you want the truth?". Like everything else we humans do, it's a matter of free will: you'll believe in the supernatural if you want to.|`|8e4506c476b48324af970127ad5cd76faa	Yes, I believe my Kung Fu is stronger than your Kung Fu.|`|mMo2hwUBaa	yes, with all my heart, all my soul, all my mind and being|`|bEeozqacaa	Believe what?

I also believe that He instructed the Holy Spirit to prepare believers for righteousness, holiness and perfection.|`|AA11440601	Yes.    I believe in God,   the Father Almighty,   Creator of Heaven and earth;   and in Jesus Christ,   His only Son Our Lord,   Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,   born of the Virgin Mary,   suffered under Pontius Pilate,   was crucified, died, and was buried.   He descended into Hell;   the third day He rose again from the dead;   He ascended into Heaven,   and sitteth at the right hand of God, the Father almighty;   from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.  I believe in the Holy Spirit,   the holy Catholic Church,   the communion of saints,   the forgiveness of sins,   the resurrection of the body and life everlasting.   Amen.

I'm a woman of color, and I noticed that when I lived in rural areas, white and Asian men were not likely to approach me.    However, when I moved to a more metropolitan area, I didn't have this same situation... probably because it's more socially acceptable.    When it comes down to it, why would you be so concerned with individuals who aren't attracted to you?  Preoccupy your mind with those who are attracted to you - they are out there and of all races and cultures.|`|PShlj7Lxaa	LOL.  I don't think that colour has anything to do with it.

Sounds like puberty to me. Hormones and such. Don't worry just play safe and be smart about how you release it.|`|NPAQxqgNaa	Marry me!|`|zGtELDrnaa	maybe you should get someone to do it with you....kinda strange|`|H1ZuIlBTaa	maybe your body and your sexual desire is telling you to follow your dreams.most strippers make alot of $$$$$$,especially if you need money for college.|`|d8DqZblcaa	Don't judge yourself, speak to a doctor. No harm in asking!|`|R8yelFG7aa	I've been there.  At least once a month, and more often during the winter- cabin fever translates to nonstop hornyness.      Hormone fluctuations can occur based on your menstrual cycle, but if you've had your period for a while now and have not experienced this before it could mean just about anything.    If it goes on a lot longer you may want to see a doctor- hormone changes can be signs of health issues.    Don't be afraid to talk to someone.  School counsilor, someone.    You can try masturbating to take the edge off.|`|9O3prIUpaa	If you'd rather not masturbate, you're kinda ******.    Not be weird, but masturbating really is a good and normal thing.  It helps you get comfortable with yourself, and its totally healthy, and satisfying.  It's nice to know what you like and what you don't, so that when you finally do find someone to help you out you know what he/she can do to make you feel amazing.  Where to touch you... how hard to press... all kinds of stuff.    If you just want it to go away, start taking cold showers and wait for it to ride out.  But if you want to satisfy it, you always can.|`|XHFj2IVhaa	Hormones. Happens to me from mid-month on to the start of my menses. Then it goes away.

ZtEVlc0yaa	I'm take things for granted.  I'm selfish.     That's not to say that I don't try to be better.  I'm human. :]|`|H2IqzG12aa	No, just inherently lazy and it's easier that way.  The same for accepting stereotypes.|`|bEeozqacaa	It appears you take spell check for granted, "and only car about..."  It is "care"|`|8j7FCEOraa	Some people just dont see things the way you do    It's all about perspective.|`|D1BNSf5uaa	or not paying attention. Sometimes you finally realize what you had after it's gone. :(|`|42cQpxviaa	It's because they don't know what kind of bad things are always possible. They take things for granted, assuming that things will always be fine and won't ever change and nothing bad will ever go their way. It's not selfish, just naive. I might be moving away from all of my best friends. I know it will be devastating, I haven't told them yet, and I always catch them saying things like "oh I wish I could move to Arizona" or something like that. And I'm thinking in my head, no you do not. So don't say it. enjoy what you have.|`|4z0Lo0qTaa	because there selfish people and they have nothing to look forward to in the future.|`|AoACu48daa	It is because to most Christians, it is granted that God put us here for some unknown reason. And as long as you survive this life without screwing up too bad, you will be promised eternal bliss. Naturally.    Atheists tend not to take things for granted. Life means a great deal more to an atheist than it does to most religious people, contrary to popular belief.|`|uIfbWdsvaa	i think its just human nature, and we do this becquse of the world around us there are people who will have more thn you and you will want these things, and if you want these things people tend to forgt the baic appreciation of life and risk it all for luxury.|`|rhuDGMlzaa	We all die in the end, so ............|`|QWr0mocnaa	An example is a healthy young, caucasian girl growing up in a 1st world country who is not in poverty not appreciating right about everything she has.|`|XBYiHaWIaa	We all take things in life for granted because we're used to it, for example we take food for granted cause we don't know what it's like to be without it whereas poor people don't...we can't fully appreciate stuff until we have to go without it for a while...it doesn't make us bad people though it's just human nature. =/|`|LUGCxeuNaa	Because people get used to things.    If someone opens the door for you everyday I'm sure it won't seem like a big thing eventually, as opposed to someone who only opens the door not so often.
EXurNsB4aa	I would spend time with my mother, sister, and my dog.  Or maybe I would like to walk out into the wilderness to be alone.  That sounds like it could be cool, but I think the softy in me would want to be with people I love.    And the time spent with them would be full of eating and drinking, because you can't eat when you're dead!|`|wlgRsZpfaa	uh, i would simply eat a cheesburger and fries and soda, sit down, and just relax while i swallow. thats wut i call relaxin'!!! (especially for the last hour!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!)|`|uxvskU7Xaa	well if i was home i'd spend it with family and friends but then maybe not - i wouldn't tell everybody cause they would be sad --- i'd just go hug a tree|`|QHx95iZDaa	I would tell my family all the things that they never let me do like dance then I would tell them all the things i did without them finding out like drinking and ya then I can die peacefully.

Not only is surviving embedded in my genes through eons of evolution, but it's also a fear of just not knowing, which is a very precarious position to be in as a completely conscious being, unlike any other forms of life that, while they mechanically run away from a possible threat to their lives, don't really think about not existing and not knowing what will happen to them. I don't think sub-human forms think at all. So as humans, we're stuck with being able to think and not knowing what will happen to us. Not a good position to be in.|`|h1eBWehMaa	no, i do not fear death. fearing death is for panzees|`|AA10696542	Dying is just as natural as living. Before you were born, you were dead.|`|Ynsow6qbaa	It is gonn happen, why fear it|`|rn7UAtYJaa	No just think of it as going to sleep after a long tiring day. Very relaxing.|`|ESzlhwoDaa	No. I'm not afraid to die. I'm ready for anything.|`|dNSvlc6caa	Not at the moment.  When it comes the time for me to die, and I'm on my deathbed then we'll truly see.  It doesn't scare me though because I don't think there's anything bad that could come after it.  Hell is a ridiculous idea, so I don't believe that will happen, and reincarnation is fine.  Ceasing to exist is also fine.|`|sknSVTGnaa	crazy christian answers on here jeez ha. but no it does not. i know its gonna happen so i dont worry about it. i think of myself as pessimistically optimistic. ha i just see things in a bad way but just dont care =D|`|rMtS7jNuaa	Absolutely not most christians aren't cause we all no that we are going to a way better lace then earth. a little place we like to call heaven|`|E3pvPh3Xaa	Why would it?

I have been a prophet for some time and no one will listen my friends have taken to calling me Jeremiah!  And yet I am never wrong!  Wouldn't you want to leave a world where this is your life?

Of course, I've been clinically dead three times already, so I am not as unprepared as some others are.|`|QI74CxD0aa	Death does not scare me nearly as much as dying does.

But if you're not going out with this girl yet - perhaps you are jumping the gun ;-)    The natural progression would be... get to know her, go on dates, get to know her some more.... then see if you want to be exclusive and in some kind of relationship.... and see where sex fits in to all of that!|`|007d0df708a440b4c3e8cdecdc32f3ebaa	you could just be very good friends just take your time if its right for you then go for it if not dont be presured into doing something you dont want to|`|t0uIgY08aa	Well if your not sure then just wait..

4PQOiSfZaa	You need to tell her that you don't feel comfortable with her touching you. Or you can nonchalantly say, "I don't feel comfortable when people are too touchy feely with me, it makes me feel uncomfortable."|`|SsB7aRExaa	Its really simple, Tina.  If you're uncomfortable, she's out of line.    I do suggest you draw a firmer line with others in your company, though.  It's not wise to allow such familiarity with co-workers.  It's too likely to lead to misunderstandings, AND it undermines  your position with  your supervisor.  If THEY can, why can't SHE?|`|AA10064810	It is totally inappropriate to make someone uncomfortable like this in any setting.  Now that she has stopped touching your employees, you have to tell her to stop touch you.  Step back.  Brush her hand away. Screw up your face and then step back.  If that doesn't work, talk to her again. Give her a reminder when she reaches out.  Maybe wave your hands, smile, and say, no, no, no as if it is a joke.    No, you are not overreacting.  Mommy teaches you to keep your hands to yourself.  Work with her on this.  If necessary, keep a log of that/when/how you responded and take it to her supervisor.      Even if she has some sort of social problem, she has to learn how to behave appropriately before it gets her into trouble.|`|xXWSpw5Saa	she weirdo does she have aa bf or isshe a lez?|`|JGGbQhCaaa	Unless your job description calls for it, the touchy stuff is not something you have to tolerate. Tell the woman you are sure she means well but you are not one who goes for the touchy stuff, that you would appreciate it if she wouldn't do it. "If there is something about my clothing that needs attention, just tell me and I can take care of it myself. Thank you."  Peace.|`|lwG6tvOqaa	I don't think she means anything bad about it. Some people are just naturally like that.  If it makes you that uncomfortable, then tell her that in a nice way, and i mean the nicest way possible, so that you won't hurt her feelings. MAybe she is lonely, so that is why she is she seems SO desperate for human contact. That might be the only way she knows how to get it. Maybe you should be her friend. She seems like a nice person, but just doesn't know when she should keep her hands to herself.    Or maybe she is a lesbian and that is why she is giving off the energy that she is. She could just want you to know that she likes you, but doesn't know how to show it in any other way besides being physical.|`|YSuc7L8taa	She is doing something wrong- a lot.    There should be no physical contact (other than a handshake) between a boss and an employee.    I believe she is physically attracted to you and is testing you for a reaction to her actions.|`|bb06GQ5Paa	Well, if you have a problem with it, you have a problem with it.  Period.  Tell the woman to lay off.  Some people are touchy-feely like that but if it seems a bit more than that, you know what I mean, tell her to keep her paws to herself.  Well, be a little nicer than that seeing that she is your supervisor.|`|na9nG47zaa	Since its bugging you and you told her it was, this is rude. Like the person above me said, some people are just touchy feely and like to touch people and have no knowledge of personal space. But since you told her that you didnt like her touching you, this is pretty inconsiderate and you should try to avoid her touchiness. if she moves in on you just walk away or something

grYkoDaraa	there is still a chance that he is not gay so i wouldn't just tell him that you know because what if he is not gay.   but you could tell him you saw the video and see if he says anything about it.|`|Mry1PfdGaa	I think you should tell your friend. And it's good that you still accept your friend even though he is into the same gender.    If he finds out that you saw that and know that you didn't tell him, he might get mad. I mean... I would!!    Good luck and I hope I helped!!! =)    P.S. And you know what?! He might not even be gay! Everyone is curious.|`|vJqPsEsWaa	There are two ways you can go with this. The first is laying low & pretending none of this ever happened. The second is telling him what you saw & that you're OK with him being gay (if he really is). But, he might be pissed off that you were messing around with his phone, but if that's what you guys do, then he must've forgotten about the porn. If you do decide to tell him, & with no complications cause of the whole phone thingy, then he'll be happy that you know & that you support him.|`|k9gp11PMaa	U should let ur friend know that u know, and tell them they u r ok w/ them being gay.|`|HgRYP3cJaa	Tell him and tell him you're there for him. It'll make his life easier.    Wish more ppl were as accepting as you are.|`|lPPgMKibaa	halle's right, just let him know and see what he says.|`|tN6JA7IQaa	I think you should just wait for him to tell you.

216d90e6aa749da6fe51585ee054ef87aa	There are unwritten rules of fishinggenerally accepted forms of etiquette you should be aware of when you begin freshwater fishingthat you wont find in a regulation booklet. Keep in mind the following:  Dont start to fish right next to another person who has been fishing in a spot before you.   Keep quiet and dont disturb the person or people fishing near you.   Most important, kill only those fish you wish to eat, provided they meet the regulations required by your state. Revive and return to the water any other fish that you catch.      nfd?|`|rThIVk2maa	Yes, keep your voice down, don't litter, don't eat peanut butter and don't set up your fishing stuff right next to another fisherperson.|`|16EYP0Xiaa	This page has a pretty good summary [aimed at fly fishing but generally applicable to other types of fishing]:      http://www.fly-fishing-colorado.com/fish...|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	Yes there are "rules" and courtesies and it depends on what kind of fishing you are doing.  If someone fishing close to you hooks a fish, everyone nearby reels in and gets out of the way so the fish doesn't tangle in anyone else's line and the fisherperson can play his fish without having to worry about who he's stepping on or whatever.  You don't mess around doing anything that'll scare the fish--like slapping the water or peeing in the water or kicking your feet in the water.  You don't use someone else's bait without asking permission, and then you only take a bare minimum--if you haven't planned well enough to cover your bait needs, then you shouldn't fish.  If you're bored, too bad, sit still and read a book, don't disturb the other people who are engrossed in fishing.  If the stringer with all the caught fish on it isn't yours, you don't touch the thing unless the owner says it's ok--and then you only pull it up long enough to look at his catch (not so long you kill the fish).  Look behind you and around you before you cast so you know who is where and avoid hooking them.  Any fish you catch you also have to unhook yourself (you can't assume someone else will do it); the exception is if you are fishing for really large fish to which you will need at least one other person to help net it or gaff it and haul it in.  If you're in a boat, you don't barge in on another boat already in a spot--they have first rights, you have to go look for somewhere else to fish.    There are more but you only learn these things by watching and learning.|`|na9nG47zaa	no clue i dont fish|`|vs5rK3iRaa	Why does Schzelle say "Don't eat peanut butter"?

12404275a6e62a47f2d36bd0fb0e6886aa	I'm an atheist who defines herself as *spiritual* rather than *weak*.    I do not believe in the existence of a supreme deity, and really don't even consider it. Likewise, I don't believe in a devil, Heaven, or Hell.    I do, however, believe in souls, spirits, angels (as guardians, not Biblical) an afterlife... All those things.    I don't have any difficulty reconciling these beliefs. I feel that our souls are our consciousness --our life-force. I believe that all living creatures possess such a life-force, and that, when we die, our life's energy changes form, continuing on in the hereafter. What we do in the hereafter, I haven't a clue.    I do feel that, in some ways, the dead are able to interact with the living. That's why we see ghosts, why strangers just "show up" out of nowhere to help stranded women or small children ... anyone in danger, or needing assistance. Then, these strangers mysteriously disappear. These would be the angels, or guardians of whom I spoke.    I realize I sound like a nut case, but I have my reasons for believing this. To me, these reasons are very convincing, and my beliefs -- strange as they are -- as valid as anyone's.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	Atheism is just not believing in a higher power. They could still believe in souls, reincarnation, and supernatural things not directly related to a higher power.|`|AQPmrsVSaa	It means they believe in the existence of a spirit or spirits, but not in a deity.|`|uBW5xrK1aa	it means they're only half-off.|`|bfc89f589815084b39b6bf5e03429630aa	Atheists are just people that are rebelling against God because of the catholic Church foundation for society.

This does not always include a deity.    Spirituality does not have anything to do with a god, unless the person believes in it.  Atheism is ONLY the non-belief in a god. It has nothing to do with anything else "out of the ordinary".    So a spiritual atheist is a person who does not believe in a god, but has a deeper meaning in life. Things such as metaphysics, ghosts, reincarnation.. etc.|`|2OmvzvLoaa	Well first you have to be raised by a bunch of drunk hippy Jews that converted to Christianity...that plants the seed of confusion then you actually have to start reading books and becoming smart.  Then you witness a world full of war and desperation and of course you have to be American.   Then you try and make yourself unique and say crap like "I'm a spiritual atheist"  so that a bunch of morons will be like, "What's a spiritual atheist?"   Either that or I guess Spiritual atheist might just be someone who does not believe in god but meditates and has some sort of deep connection with the etherial mystical parts of his mind that he or she can't explain.  Then they cultivate their belief in godlessness and spirituality. TADA!!!! There it is.|`|u48Wzj3yaa	A person is an atheist if they do not believe in any gods, or god.    This means that they can believe in anything from fairies to reincarnation to an afterlife. Anything but a divine being, or divine beings, essentially. You can also be a religious atheist, because some religions are atheistic (like Buddhism) which would make you both spiritual and religious, but still an atheist.

ejbSFv0caa	Well I was an evolutionist in exactly that position.  So one day I was challenged to go and read the stuff for myself.  I did.    After a year or two of researching a variety of subjects such as the development of the horse [Eohippus] I came to the conclusion - you can't trust the easy to read books!  The guys that wrote them tell lies sometimes!  You don't believe me ... read on...    I started reading the hard stuff - like scientific Journals and was surprised to find that, so long as I had a good couple of dictionaries nearby, I could actually understand them.  But what surprised me more than anything is how over the years so many books have been published stating this and that as fact when really it is hypothetical [unproven] and based upon some spurious arguments that in them selves often don't hold water.  With the book on Eohippus I was told the development of the horse went from small to large.  The 'scientists' writing that book neglected to tell me that they deliberately mixed up the fossil records to fit their argument as the fossils were not found to be dated conveniantly.    There were many more such things.  So now I ask my self does the science hold up?  What SOLID evidence is there and what guesswork is needed to make the hypothesis worth looking at further.     Often I get Carbon Dating thrown at me.  Yet no consideration is given for fossils that may have been subjected to unusual background radiation [bumping up or down the apparent age] - Such radiation blips that are known to occur around volcanoes.  Nor is the reality that rotting corpses do not become fossils unless under extremes of pressure and temperature [common sense if you think about it.  There's always some hungry crittur will nibble on the corpse]  Seen the fossilised Angler fish about to scoff the other little fish?  Fossilisation is fast!    So keep ignoring the real evidence and stick to the pseudo-science of the classroom, until you qualify to do your own research THEN go for it - hard science ;]  You might grow to like it -I did ;]    LOL TD's eh?  nice to see the scientific method applied  - not!

The Harpies were employed by the gods to punish crime on the Earth. Their names were Aello ("the Stormswift"), Celaeno ("the Dark") and Ocypete ("the Swiftwing").    Description  In earlier versions of Greek Mythology, Harpies were described as beautiful winged maidens. Later they became winged monsters with the face of an ugly old woman with crooked, sharp talons.  The Harpies were fierce, filthy, winged monsters who had characteristics of a bird and a woman, similar to that of the early Sirens. Their hideous faces of women with sharp claws mounted on the bodies of vultures inspired both horror and disgust. They could fly as fast as a bolt of lightening. The Harpies were depicted as winged women, sometimes with ugly faces, or with the lower bodies of birds.   The Harpies were frightful flying creatures with hooked beaks and claws who always left behind them a loathful stench. A winged beast, with the head and breasts of a woman, and the body of a bird.    Features Noisy, filthy,  and always hungry.  Described By: Homer        Origin   The three daughters of Thaumas and Electre called Aello, Ocypete, and Celaeno were originally goddesses with beautiful hair and wings until they were reduced to such fearsome monsters.They were also referred to as "robbers," "snatchers," and "those who seize," meaning that they would steel anything that did not belong to them. They snatched food from their victims or left a loathsome stench rendering it unedible. They were also referred to as the "hounds of Zeus." In Hesiod: "(ll. 265-269) And Thaumas wedded Electra the daughter of deep- flowing Ocean, and she bare him swift Iris and the long-haired Harpies, Aello (Storm-swift) and Ocypetes (Swift-flier) who on their swift wings keep pace with the blasts of the winds and the birds; for quick as time they dart along.     Role  They serve Zeus. They are sometimes represented as demons of death carrying away the souls of deceased persons (see the Haryp tomb in the British Museum).The people feared them for it was said that they stole small children and carried away the weak and the wounded. The Harpies were probably the personification of storm winds. They were represented carrying off persons to the underworld and inflicting punishment or tormenting them. Those persons were never seen again. THE HARPYIAI (or Harpies) were the spirits of sudden, sharp gusts of wind. They were known as the hounds of Zeus and were despatched by the god to snatch away (harpaz?) people and things from the earth. Sudden, mysterious dissappearances were often attributed to the Harpyiai.          Stories   One of the most famous stories involves Phineus, the King of Thessaly, who had the gift of seeing into the future. Phineus told Zeus' secrets to others and Zeus took away his sight and sent the Harpies, the "hounds of Zeus," to come after him. Zetes and Calais, sons of Boreas, who were amongst the Argonauts, delivered Phineus from the Harpies. The Strophades (`Islands of Turning') are here supposed to have been so called because the sons of Boreas were there turned back by Iris from pursuing the Harpies because they turned there and prayed Zeus to seize the Harpies. But according to Hesiod... they were not killed.   The most complete description in in the There Phineus, son of Agenor, had his home by the sea, Phineus who above all men endured most bitter woes because of the gift of prophecy which Leto's son had granted him aforetime. And he reverenced not a whit even Zeus himself, for he foretold unerringly to men his sacred will. Wherefore Zeus sent upon him a lingering old age, and took from his eyes the pleasant light, and suffered him not to have joy of the dainties untold that the dwellers around ever brought to his house, when they came to enquire the will of heaven. But on a sudden, swooping through the clouds, the Harpies with their crooked beaks incessantly snatched the food away from his mouth and hands. And at times not a morsel of food was left, at others but a little, in order that he might live and be tormented. And they poured forth over all a loathsome stench; and no one dared not merely to carry food to his mouth but even to stand at a distance; so foully reeked the remnants of the meal." When Jason and the Argonauts visited Phineus, Zetes and Calais, sons of the North Wind, pursued the Harpies through the sky. Iris or Hermes convinced Zeus to remove the Harpies from Phineus. When the Argonauts came to visit, the winged Boreades gave chase, and pursued the Harpies to the Strophades Islands, where the goddess Iris commanded them to turn back and leave the storm-spirits unharmed.|`|IKyITYICaa	Watch 'The View'.  There's lots of them.|`|lDEGaK7Laa	Harpies are from Greek mythology. They were generally birds with women's heads, and they were repulsive and filthy. There were usually three of them, though their number varies: Aello, Ocypete, and Podarge. They tormented Phineus, who was blind, by snatching and defiling his food. They were eventually driven away to the Strophades by Zetes and Calais when the Argonauts visited Thrace.|`|zOX3bunMaa	They shreik to deafen their enemies. And they have hideous human faces.

The literal meaning of the word seems to be "that which snatches" as it comes from the ancient Greek word harpazein (??), which means "to snatch".    The harpy could also bring life. A harpy was the mother by the West Wind Zephyros of the horses of Achilles    Though Hesiod (Theogony) calls them two "lovely-haired" creatures, harpies as beautiful winged bird-women are a late development, in parallel with the transformation of the siren, a "creature malign though seductive in Homer, but gradually softened by the Athenian imagination into a sorrowful death angel|`|uHKzLFIgaa	One of several loathsome, voracious monsters with the head and trunk of a woman and the tail, wings, and talons of a bird.

They had to do the drill with their hands over their heads in a crouched position against an interior wall.  As teachers, we had to go through the bathrooms and stairwells to make sure they were empty.  Our principal at the time always said we could lead the children into song or prayer to comfort them.

One of my classmates and her family lived in a bomb shelter as an experiment for about a month.  I was terrified that we would be bombed from that point on.  So I was never quite sure if the alert was real or just a test.  I found every bomb shelter in my area, full of canned goods.      We still have a siren alert once a month, because of the proximity to a nuclear facility.|`|LQ52bOFFaa	Yes and the TV and radio interrupting service for a civil defense broadcasting test.|`|gCAJaFnyaa	We would go to the basement and sit in the hallway during these practice drills.

You mine as well kiss your asp. good by.  I also lived in San Francisco, so we would have our earthquake drills, again the duck & cover. I remember having to stand in the door jam,  at home, during several of our quakes that we had.  There was one earthquake, air raid shelter in a parking lot in San Francisco, that I saw first hand. All it had in it was barrels of water, and crackers. Like we could live on that, if something did happen. I might add that several of the barrels were dented, and some of the crackers boxes, the use by date had expired. Lot of help there.|`|IWyrJ7o3aa	No that is so funny because, I was in school in the 50,s & early 60,s and we lived pretty close to an atomic plant. but nothing was ever said to us, maybe  because we were so closed they were afraid we would be scared to death>
AA11616515	First  stop confessing your shy, call yourself reserved   Shy paints a picture in your mind that you automatically adapt to.    You can move from reserved to outgoing by confessing that you are. You already know that once you get to know me youre really fun, and you believe that. So start by forcing yourself to act like youre outgoing, and picturing yourself as an outgoing person, and soon you will become that.   Perception is reality to us, how you perceive yourself is how you will be.|`|ReSEVVDyaa	theres no quick fix  this may sound weird or bad or whatever but  try pretending your really outgoing  you dont have to walk up to someone,   just talk to someone around you  even is you're scared stiff, don't let it show  kinda like a dare  eventually you'll get used to it  and you wont have to pretend anymore  also, its always easier to approach someone who's alone  try talking to someone in the elevator   or someone sitting next to you|`|5xDcnlKxaa	Tell me about it, I am so shy. It took about 2 school years until I finally open up to people.    One day, just get really cute, i.e. dress sexy [not slutty] and look beautiful [not dolled up]. Convince yourself that you KNOW you look good. Don't let it get to your head.    When you are in front of people, build up all this confidence, but don't be concieted. Confidence will help you.    I've done all this before and somehow when your opportunity arrives, you choke.    SO to that I would just say, "If you don't do it know you will regret it."  I don't know how many times I think back & wish I would've spoken up..|`|lQg2Ccbjaa	I have the same problem too, and I struggle with it to this day, even though I'm in my 20's.  The only suggestion I can give you is stop thinking about what other people think.  Just tell yourself that I'm fun and smart and people like, and if they don't, then I don't have to know about it and it won't affect me in any way whatsoever.
sgRJRuvgaa	Seriously does the world really need proof of something we THE GAYS already know is unconrollable genetically or not. My grandmother nearly died from cancer now she has no breasts because of not knowing a cure.|`|h1eBWehMaa	i have no idea...|`|oVeGMNsLaa	You might as well ask why scientists are studying the big bang theory and why Steven Hawking is working on the theory of everything.    Scientists try to answer life's questions.  Such is science.    Moreover, understanding sexuality in a scientific sense can help have practical applications elsewhere.  There have been so many times when scientists are studying one thing and end up discovering something incredible that is only slightly related.|`|XjLvbfTZaa	Because some people believe finding a "cure" for homosexuality is more important than finding a cure for cancer?|`|JgNMqaPmaa	yeah and they should also look for std curs but on the other hand it would prove that people are born gay or bi or whatever|`|758f1c16f8aa9b1d1195f3f7d3415ca4aa	Because the two go hand in hand. Both are linked to the DNA, a cancer is a genetic mistake and "the gay gene" is thought to be genetic as well. You may as well kill two birds with one stone.|`|rxQ4wtnkaa	I don't know some people think being a homo is contagious|`|kgAmVqqzaa	i dont know, because they want to figure out whats "wrong" with us? they want to fix something that theres nothing wrong with. its stupid and they could be doing so much more important things with that money.|`|5EvoGuQDaa	The answer is because the cure to cancer has been around for a while. The government hid it because there would be a loss of jobs if it was made they need to create medicine to keep u buying it to make money health doesn't make money sickness does what good would it be if everyone was healthy? What they dnt kno scientifically is homosexuality because its a spirit! Not a problem. Every sin that u act out causes an effect on ur life and it gets inherited by ur children that's y a child knows how to lie when nobody has taught it to him. We are born into sin because of generational curses passed down the same way u can inherit money and debt in the spirit its the same. Homosexuality comes from traumatic events in a persons life a rape, molestation etc there are consequences for sin and there's nothing scientific about that.|`|xuuaMTmtaa	I'm a scientist. I don't "waste my time" with ANYTHING I do.     I do what I do, because it all serves a purpose to SOMEONE. Every culture I do to look for bacteria, every blood specimen I process, every unit of blood I verify for transfusion, every chemistry test I run, every lipid panel I do, goes to help SOMEONE.      This is the nature of science.  We do what we do to benefit a greater good.  Scientists do research.  We don't just concentrate on one area.  We research everything that needs answers and/or cures and solutions.      Lots of geneticists study all kinds of genes, not just the possible "gay gene".  What if those scientists just quit looking for say...a genetic marker for brain tumors, or parkinson's disease, or researching new methods for detecting things like crytosporidium?  These advances in research, and the naturally curious nature of scientists, is what has led us to the advancements we have today.  It was AIDS research in fact, that led us to have the ability to use DNA probes for diseases and ELISA testing for others things besides just the HIV virus.      So, more than likely, in this quest for a "gay gene" other new improvements and technologies will be developed out of that as well to be used for other genetic research.  The same thing will probably come about from cancer research as well.  We already have been able to predict tumor markers for breast cancer now, that we wouldn't have been able to do before if we hadn't invested in cancer research.|`|wbfw04xPaa	Well because they don't study cancer. They decided to stay in the closet and try as hard as possible to "cure" themselves so they can finally be NORMAL, and earn their parents love.|`|7b1f8172d4a9ac10c23b5f3870728bb8aa	because some people think being gay is also a disease.  which is totally stupid.|`|UndOg7yeaa	well i personally think if they do find a gene people may be more accepting.|`|IAXhu2tuaa	Are you doing cancer research?

RZetcwalaa	OK im doing my First year of AS levels now, i took chemistry, physics, maths and psycology, im really enjoying chemistry at the moment but i love all science. Maths is by far the hardest, you gotta study and awful lot, physics is also pretty tough. Psycology i find quite easy but this is most probably because i took a GCSE in the subject last year.     I also have a lot of freinds who have finished their A levels and the consensus is maths and physics are hardest, but the pay off is that these are also the most valued by employers, i hope i helped but the most important advice is to take subjects you are interested in you are far more likely to actually enjoy them them, good luck.|`|hcu9wBFmaa	I took Biology, Psychology, Physics and Chemistry    Enjoyed Psychology and Biology the most    Physics was the most difficult and I ended up dropping out    Didn't regret any|`|dvY6UfiYaa	I'm in the midst of taking Physics, Biology and English Language.

(it is a degree I promise!!) am doing what I want now but still regret my choices and wish i'd of thought harder.    I always knew i wanted to do design, was never hugely academic... I started off doing maths, art, design tech and psychology, I meant to drop psych. at AS level and continue with the rest but unfortunately i flunked maths, much harder at a level than gcse!!  I chose maths as i wantd to take atleast 1 academic subject, art I did as i it had always been my fave subject at school and i considered it an 'easy' fun course to do - which due to its practical nature ie. lack of SA writing, it was - chose design tech for obvious reasons and loved it, learnt a lot of practical, design, presentation and business skills, great course... and psych. i didn't know much about but just thought it would be interesting, it was but has not been greatly beneficial to me since...    I really regret not taking a science, my dad recently told me that for someone with a physics A level there are pages and pages of jobs compared even to something like english which has almost half the amount... saying that I also regret not taking english, as an academic subject is always good.    basically i'd say do either english or maths for a start, then physics or something that opens many career doors (economics or business studies is always a useful one) then a subject that you enjoy and have fun doing (maybe a creative subject like art, drama or photography), just so that you dont go mad with essay writing and equations, etc...    hope this has been some help,  work hard, you'll regret it later if you dont   x|`|6fFNdlNfaa	Applied science, IT diploma (l2), ASDAN. cause it sounded interesting    ok    applied science    IT was the easiest and science was hard

SsSIbFhcaa	Sorry Ben the bible is real, fact and God is real and present.    http://www.comereason.org/exst_god/defau...    http://www.godandscience.org/    manuscript evidence for the "New Testament" is also dramatic, with nearly 25,000 ancient manuscripts discovered and archived so far, at least 5,600 of which are copies and fragments in the original Greek. 4 Some manuscript texts date to the early second and third centuries, with the time between the original autographs and our earliest existing fragment being a remarkably short 40-60 years. 5     Interestingly, this manuscript evidence far surpasses the manuscript reliability of other ancient writings that we trust as authentic every day. Look at these comparisons: Julius Caesar's The Gallic Wars (10 manuscripts remain, with the earliest one dating to 1,000 years after the original autograph); Pliny the Younger's Natural History (7 manuscripts; 750 years elapsed); Thucydides' History (8 manuscripts; 1,300 years elapsed); Herodotus' History (8 manuscripts; 1,350 years elapsed); Plato (7 manuscripts; 1,300 years); and Tacitus' Annals (20 manuscripts; 1,000 years). 6     http://www.allaboutthejourney.org/bible-...    and    http://www.bible.org/page.php?page_id=40...    Historically and archeologically the bible has been proven time and time again.    Example: Among the many supposed mistakes of Luke that have since been vindicated was the mention in Luke 3:1 of Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene in the fifteenth year of Tiberius (A.D. 27- 28). The only Lysanias of Abilene otherwise known from ancient history was a king who was executed by the order of Mark Antony in 34 B.C. We now have archaeological evidence of a later Lysanias who had the status of tetrarch. An inscription recording the dedication of a temple reads, "For the salvation of the Lords Imperial and their whole household, by Nymphaeus, a freedman of Lysanias the tetrarch." The reference to "Lords Imperial," which was a joint title given only to the emperor Tiberius and his mother Livia, the widow of Augustus, establishes the date of the inscription to between A.D. 14 and 29, the years of Tiberius' accession and Livia's death, respectively.5     http://www.grmi.org/Richard_Riss/evidenc...

This is some stuff I made:  Some arguments against the christian god:  My hypothesis on why most people are christian:    Throughout history there have been many wars about religion. Usually, christianity won. After a while the christian army began being feared and people started to convert to christianity out of fear. Over time, it got worked into families and the reason for why they believed it was forgotten. They were lost in the delusions and lies of christianity and got entrenched in the beliefs. So many people are christian not because it is the one true religion, but because it eliminated the competition.    If he tries to pull the "You can't prove something doesn't exist" on you, then reply by saying you can. For instance, you can prove that no even number higher than two that is prime exists.   Here is what I think about the bible:  The bible is a load of BS! It's full of plt holes, contradicts itself constantly, and was changed by hundreds of different writers over hundreds of years and they took out and added what they wanted. They CLEARLY weren't prophets to god and haven't witnessed Genesis, so what they wrote CAN'T be true. Just the fact that it's an ancient book changed over and over again should prove the bible isn't true.     Christianity is very childish. Believing in god is like believing in Santa Claus. Believing in the bible isn't LIKE believing in a book of fairy tales, it IS believing a book of fairy tales.     The christians say that god gives you free will. Sure, techinically you choose to be a christian and believe in god, but it's not really that fair. Suppose I put a gun to your head and said "You have a choice to give me your wallet, but f you are defiant then I will shoot and kill you."  Doesn't sound like free will to me. And that's exactly what the bible is.  You either vow not to kill and love thy neighbor AND discriminate gays and those other religions while frequently sacraficing animals and other humans (doesn't make much sense, does it?) wasting your life doing that OR you burn in a fiery pit of doom for all eternity.   Free will?  Yeah, right!    I have more but I don't have the time to type it out. Some of this I took into my own words from www.evilbible.com    You can message me.

This is what you need to do:      Get an easy to understand bible, such as the Living Bible or the New internation version.    Read the New Testament, or at least the books of Luke, John, Romans, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians. Most of those are only a few pages.      Why? Because if you don't know the Bible, you shouldn't be arguing it at all.     NEVER get your information from propaganda websites. This will only make you look VERY foolish, especially if your friend knows his Bible well and will put you to shame when you give inaccurate information. You want ORIGINAL sources.    Read it first, and then make an educated decision about what it says.        PS: If you aren't saved, you will find that you have incredible difficulty understanding the Bible.     2Corinthians 2:11-For who among men knows the thoughts of a man except the man's spirit within him? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. 12We have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit who is from God, that we may understand what God has freely given us. 13This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words.14The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned.|`|ViZH5twNaa	Radiometric dating (tracking the amount of radioactive decay unstable material within rock has undergone since formation) shows the Earth is much older than the Bible suggests. The Bible suggests a few thousand while dating methods say over 4 billion.    There was no global flood. Such a flood would wipe out every land species and many sea species by messing up salinity and pressures of the sea floor. Not to mention every species on Earth could not have possibly fit onto a single ark.    The Bible says rabbits chew cud and insects have 4 legs.    There are no giant fish that can swallow an entire person and keep him alive for days.    It was created by people, not God, people. It says in the Bible that pi is exactly 3 and not 3.14. That sounds a lot like it must have been written by men instead of a perfect being.    Jesus never says he is God, only God's son which for all intensive purposes we are all God's children if He exists. Why do you think Christians say "Father who art in Heaven"?    We don't know who wrote the Gospels and where written decades after Jesus died thus we have no first hand accounts of even Jesus' existence. All non-biblical sources make no mention of Jesus except of Josephus who's accounts where altered by the early church.    Generally the Bible reads more like a bunch of mythological stories rather than the perfect book.|`|YOWnMp0Xaa	I think the trick is to stop trying to think of such things in terms of "true" and "false". because from a non-subjective viewpoint, the bible is neither.    If you study much of the bible, you'll notice that it is often up for interpretation, and I suspect it may have been written simply to make humans think. And everyone's interpretation is different, so who is right? Not everyone, surely....but does that mean the bible is wrong? No. It is simply text, written for a particular reason.    Here's an example. I had a discussion with some Jehovah's witnesses about a particular passage they quoted: "The way to eternal life is narrow"  Now, they claimed this passage meant "Only a select few can travel on the path to heaven, because it's so narrow". Essentially implying thhat there's a limit on the door count. Which made no sense to me, because I saw the passage as meaning "the path is narrow, so it's easily to fall off and lose your way".    When I brought my interpretation up, they seemed stunned....clearly they'd never looked at it that way, and had always assumed their interpretation was not only the right one, but the ONLY one.    So don't get bogged down in whether the "Bible is True" or not, start thinking about what people actually think the bible means, and whether THAT'S true.|`|cNniG2L0aa	The bible is not the inspired word of God.

Then again there are websites that prove that the Jewish Holocaust didnt happen either.  there are websites that prove that aliens run the United States.  If you want the truth of the Bible you cannot learn it from those that hate it.  .  The Bible was written in a vague cryptic style as not to be understood by those that oppose it but of those who advocate it.  For the skeptic gleans from the text what may be invented against itself and the Bibles design provides ample fodder for them to choke on.  The truth of the Bible isnt to be found in "one liner scriptures"  but of a greater context which can only be recieved through study and the power of God.  The truth of the Bible is found in the conveyance of Gods message to His children and not from a literalists quest for error.  For the Gospel of Jesus Christ is foolishness to those that are perishing.   They are  never satisfied, never coming to the understanding of the truth.      1 Corinthians 1  21  For since in the wisdom of God the world through its wisdom did not know him, God was pleased through the foolishness of what was preached to save those who believe. 22Jews demand miraculous signs and Greeks look for wisdom, 23but we preach Christ crucified: a stumbling block to Jews and foolishness to Gentiles,     Matthew 11:25  At that time Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and learned, and revealed them to little children.    2 Corinthians 4:4  The god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.     Luke 8  9 His disciples asked him what this parable meant. 10 He said, "The knowledge of the secrets of the kingdom of God has been given to you, but to others I speak in parables, so that,     "though seeing, they may not see;  though hearing, they may not understand.'    John 1:5  The light shines in the darkness, but the darkness has not understood it.|`|rjbisHLOaa	Titus 1:14  Do not give heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.    Best approach: tell him you worship Odin. Explain that the Eddas say that they are the words of Odin, and they say that Odin never lies, so they must be true. Tell him that if he does not repent and pray to Odin that he will be denied entry to the heavens and will be sent to Nilfhelm after he dies.    Then tell him that Odin allows homosexuality, but hates black people. Make up a verse to justify it. Explain that this is not racism, because it comes from Odin.|`|4Za1utmCaa	As a Christian who believes that the Bible is real (though not to be taken literally as the word of God in all circumstances) I can tell you that no one can prove the existence of God. This is because proof is based on a testing methodology rooted in science, and the existence of God is not scientifically testable. That is why Christians are suppose to rely on faith that God is real, not logic. Remember, for thousands of years, those who believed the earth was round, could not prove it either. They relied on faith as well, until the proof came.     As far as the Bible goes? Ethically speaking, you can prove that many of it's moral laws (murder, theft, etc) are true even if you remove religious faith. This is backed up by the shear fact that many Biblical morals are cited as law in every culture. You can also scientifically test that if many of these morals are broken, a negative affect will occur. As far as historical claims of miracles occurring as part of the stories told, they cannot be proven. Once again, as a Christian, you must have faith to believe in their truth.    And BTW, Spazzy Magee is wrong when he says the Bible claims that the Earth is only a few thousand years old. The Bible makes no claim of the Earth's age. It simply isn't there. There are some kooky Christians that believe in what is called dispensationalism, which includes a mis-guided interpretation of the Earth's age via a silly attempt of trying to estimate a time-line to the Bible. The Bible does not mentioned the Rapture either. Much of the end times prophecy is a gross mis-interpretation.

yFX0mdOhaa	I think it is a big turn on.  I think it's the idea that everything is new and fresh to you.  Every little act seems a little more special as opposed to someone who has done everything hundreds of times.  <br>  <br>  The difference is, I would be in NO hurry to rush into bed with you.  I would want the moment to be very special and memorable.  I would want to take everything super slow, and enjoy every sensual moment.

JTu1cLkYaa	I've wondered what the use is of having your number on a do not call list because I still get calls. I screen all my calls on my answering machine. Most the time the caller just hangs up, but I do get those repeat recorded messages for the credit cards, car warranties and mortgage payments. I don't press the button to be removed anymore since I was told that while they do take your number off from their list, they forward your number to about 5 other lists. Then, if you press the button to removed from those lists, your number gets sent back on the original list and it starts all over again.|`|E7SUmqrqaa	Mine are pharmacies!!

6SwaWSoyaa	You aren't going to die and lets hope you aren't considering anything stupid.  You aren't alone, there are many other gay people and almost every gay person feels alone at times.  You are what a junior or senior? So am I, except I live 2 hours north of Nashville in Indiana (which has nothing to do with much but you were talking about tennessee) anyway what I was saying. Realize if he is an upperclassmen making asshole jokes, he isn't going much anywhere in is life if he is immature, and it sounds like he is.   Also he could be a closet gay who just likes to hit on guys, or wait......nvm that is the definition of jock. A "straight" athletic man who hits on other men.  If I were you I would punch him in the face (last resort), make him feel stupid about something, or just ignore him and realize you can do a lot better.  Don't listen to the d-bags saying "just be straight" because that isn't going to and can't happen.  Don't fall for someone who is a complete asshole to you.

GC4NRW15aa	SEMICOLON  Between closely related independent clauses not conjoined with a co-ordinating conjunction: "I went to the swimming pool; I was told it was closed for a routine barnacle husking."     between independent clauses linked with a transitional phrase or a conjunctive adverb: "I like to eat cows; however, they don't like to be eaten by me."     COLON  syntactical-deductive: introduces the logical consequence, or effect, of a fact stated before     There was only one possible explanation: the train had never arrived.   syntactical-descriptive: introduces a descriptionin particular, makes explicit the elements of a set   I have three sisters: Catherine, Sarah and Mary.     appositive: introduces a sentence with the role of apposition with respect to the previous one   Luruns could not speak: he was drunk.[2]   segmental: introduces a direct speech, in combination with quotation marks and dashes. The segmental function was once a common means of indicating an unmarked quotation on the same line. The following example is from Fowler's grammar book, The Kings English:   Benjamin Franklin proclaimed the virtue of frugality: a penny saved is a penny earned.     It is commonly used to introduce speech in a dialogue (such as a script):   Patient: Doctor, I feel like a pair of curtains.  Doctor: Pull yourself together!     COMMA  In lists - I spoke to the boys, Sam and Tom.    Separation of clauses - I cut down all the trees, which were over six feet tall.    Parenthetical phrases - Once upon a time, I didn't know how to use commas|`|BeAVEk2yaa	The semicolon is used when one complete thought is added to another. The second thought must add to the first one.   EX: Call me tomorrow; I will give you my answer then.    To gauge if a semicolon is appropriate, it helps if you imagine the word furthermore.  EX: Call me tomorrow. Furthermore, I will give you my answer.     Sometimes (in addition to commas) semicolons will be used in stating a series.   So instead of this:   I visited Los Angeles, California, Miami, Florida, and Memphis, Tennessee.   It would be this:  I visited Los Angeles, California; Miami, Florida; and Memphis, Tennessee.       You use a colon when you're restating an idea in a different way.  EX: John Doe was an unhappy fellow: a poor man, out of touch with life's joys.     You also use a colon to clarify something.   EX: Jane Doe was unhappy; she had eaten too much candy and was now paying the price.     Colons are also used when introducing a list.  EX:  Unable to ascertain the exact cause of death, the doctor turned the body over to a team of forensic experts: Janice Trico, the county coroner; Gerald Sota, the county sheriff; and Michael Jesperson, the head of the county crime lab.    Colon can almost take the place of the words 'is' + 'and'.   EX: My little dog: a heartbeat at my feet.  In this case, the colon takes the place of the word 'is'.       A comma can be used to combine two sentences.   EX: My friends are going to Europe this summer. I am planning a trip to Mexico....can be turned into....My friends are going to Eurpoe this summer, but I am panning a trip to Mexico.   (The word 'but' in this sense is a conjunction. Other examples of conjunctions are and + or)    Commas can also be used after introductory words.   EX: After eating, the male lion rested in nearby shade.  EX: In the meantime, we continued to photograph the playful cubs.    Commas are also used in series.   EX: The manager met with her office staff, departmental heads, and technical advisers.    Hope this helps. It took me a pretty long time to type out. :)

b0c36350d835d81614a99e05c0418bf5aa	enablers are usually co-dependent. The person needs someone to take care of, and the addict needs them. It's an unhealthy relationship at the very least.     Being concerned is one thing and enabling is another. Concern is asking if he's okay, enabling is buying his drugs or making it easier for him to use. Back off his girlfriend because you will be the bad guy no matter what. Let him know you will be a friend to him, but also make it known that you don't like what he's doing. As far as his addiction he has to be the one to want to stop. No matter how much harping you do, that's what it comes down to.|`|AA12152549	Enabling in this way is not helping your friend.

LoOBJ6RTaa	It's not a choice that you can make. The sex that you are attracted to is not your choice, it's how you feel. I can't help the fact that I'm into guys just the same as lesbians can't help that they're into women, and gay guys can't help the fact that they're into guys. I can't believe that people are saying that it's a "choice" because it's not. And you can't do studies to figure out if IS a choice or not, because, like I said, it's what you're attracted to. It's human nature.|`|wig4qCeJaa	It seems that many religious people believe that gays are that way by choice.

Most older people are more traditional christians, and weren't areound homosexuals in their day.  They don't understand it like young people do.  More people are understanding of homosexuality now than ever, since times are changing.  I think most modern christians like me know it's not a choice and accept people for it.  :]]|`|7e2dad446deb31af0e15a02d4e75fc9caa	I cant speak for every church ... but yes I do and for those of our congregation, If I am asked that is what I tell them, I believe that homosexuality is a choice, if someone disagrees with me that is their right and they can do that but when I preach on the topic I preach from that standpoint and will not change it to pacify men.|`|SnqZcQIgaa	It seems to me that a lot of religious people claim that it's a choice because it makes them feel better about condemning it.     Personally, I think it's inhumane to dismiss it as mere 'choice'. I don't believe that it's any more a choice than heterosexuality is.    There was a time when left-handed children were forced to write with their right hands, because that was believed to be a choice. That ridiculous notion has been largely dismissed these days; hopefully the idea that 'homosexuality is a choice' will go the same way.|`|0bYcYz2jaa	It is a choice.  The theory of evolution actually may help prove that.    According to evolution, creatures adapt and change to further their specie's ability to survive and thrive.  Homosexuality provides no biological purpose, being that it does not make one a better provider, protector or raiser of young, or actually enable one to produce offspring at all.  Therefore, there is no biological purpose for homosexuality which means we would not naturally be inclined to anything of the sort unless we were an aberration of our species.  I'm at least giving the gay community the courtesy of saying they are not animals, natural aberrations, or anomalies, but that they choose their lifestyles as they see fit.  I don't agree with their lifestyle choices but I do appreciate that they are my human kindred and able to choose.    EDIT: for those who say it's not a 'mere' choice, that freewill and ability to choose our paths is what makes us human.|`|2gyJUTzRaa	not all religious people do.  not all religious people are stupid.|`|QLDMmp6Taa	Not all jump to such conclusions.

I am genetically born a warrior, but that doesn't mean society forgives me if I decide because I am born that way  I can kill people at will.  Would you look the other way and just say oh, it is okay.  Not likely.|`|XmJZkFuMaa	I have never heard anyone argue that it's simply a choice.  Even back in the 70's when it was listed as a mental disorder, it wasn't seen as a choice.  I think part of the problem of miscommunication happens from people hearing someone saying "homosexual behavior is a choice" and assuming that what religious folks mean is that the homosexual impulses are also a choice.  Or that "you're not born that way" and people assuming that what they just said was that you chose to be that way (not the case, usually people who believe that believe there are other causes other than genetics or in addition to genetics that caused it.)    The problem is partly that the studies that you believe are conclusive actually AREN'T.  There is no way to run a bloodtest on you or me and tell us how 'homosexual' we are.  Or even that we have a 20% more likely to be.  People point to twin studies without realizing that twin studies also prove that since every time you have identical twins you don't always have identical sexual impulses, while there seems to be a biological component it also does not seem to be the sole cause of the behavior.    But one of the biggest myths out there is that most people in religion who believe that homosexual behavior is a sin believe it's a choice.  Like I've said, I don't know ANYONE who says that every homosexual was driven only by the choice they made to be homosexual.  That's ridiculous.    What is a choice is the behavior.  Unless you want to say that genetics are SO in control that they're like animals and will have sex because they can't control it.  I prefer to think of people as people who can resist the temptation and urges they naturally have if they decide to.    Add:  Actually the theory of evolution says that in a hunting-herd-pack type family (like humans) there are members who should not reproduce, help to provide for the existing children, and homosexuality helps to provide this.  Evolutionarily, homosexuality makes sense.|`|Kfv2UP6Aaa	Most that I know do. Silly, isn't it?|`|eAMq1iBWaa	Gay BEHAVIOR undeniably is. Ever hear of self-discipline and self-respect?

I have a few friends who are not "GAY" (they definitely prefer women).    But during college, they did some gay hanky panky with DUDES!      Believe me, it was a choice!    Also for girls it is waaaaay more common!    It's hard to find a girl these days who has NOT "hooked up" with another girl.    (so hot)!|`|pw4Cb45Kaa	NO!       GOD BLESS!   AMEN!    SHALOM!|`|IdlaZQ8Jaa	Nature has a natural order and will do what ever it takes to preserve itself. Tolerance of homosexuality indicates that world has produced and over abundant amount of people and it is naturally seeking out a predator to reduce over population.  So if it isn't a choice or a disease(like alcoholism), it's because the homosexuals have some sort biological defect similar to down syndrome.|`|29X6EEsKaa	They must think that, even tho they never did this, during puberty homosexuals said "Hmm.

It is clearly a choice to have sex with that person.  Unless it is rape, it is a choice to have sex with any person.  Nature has undisputedly won in this case over nuture and all studies have proven that.  They still, however, have a choice in which lifestyle to live like an alcoholic has a choice to drink or not.|`|b6rBHPMlaa	No, not at all. There are an awful lot of homosexual people who are also religious, and also a lot of of people who are religious and believe that homosexuality is a biological trait. I would be the latter.|`|jBYxEX8taa	It's a choice. How come many gay people turn straight, get married and have kids? Interesting...|`|TSCfQTw3aa	I believe that we are all given temptation to sin, and each of us are tempted in different ways. Homosexual acts are sins. You have a choice whether or not to participate in any sexual act. I would like to know what biological component you are talking about? Or did that just sound good? Instead of looking at Biology to try and find an answer as to why homosexuality is so rampant I would like you to look at Psychology and the undeniable evidence that exists, linking sexual molestation as a child to feelings of homosexuality later in life. You will always have a way to overcome sin if you look towards the man Jesus Christ who died to allow you forgiveness for your sins.|`|E3pvPh3Xaa	Homosexuality is a question of being and not a question of doing. Gays can't just decide to be attracted to women and not men, just as heterosexuals can't decide to be attracted to the same sex.    But yes, they could stop having gay sex, but why should they? Whatever floats your boat I say.|`|PPvk105Caa	Being ignorant is a choice, being gay, being white, being black, being crippled is not a choice.|`|cNniG2L0aa	They do BUT if you ask them if they remember making the choice the honest ones will admit they don't remember.  ~|`|AA10192697	I honestly don't know if it's a personal choice, if it's genetics, caused by childhood trauma, or what.  But I think it's unnatural and goes against how God created mankind to be together.  I think either way, it's a temptation that can be dealt with.  Like any temptation, you can be attracted to the same sex but don't have to act on it.|`|592517cb7a38eb4f9614445c37df538aaa	I don't believe that anybody can help whom they are attracted to. I couldn't tell you why I fell in love with my spouse and some other guy -- it just happened.    But I do believe that ALL people regardless of their sexual orientation are capable of choosing when, where and with whom they have sex.     Oh, and my church does not teach that people choose their sexual orientation.|`|flrOp5YLaa	I do not believe it is a choice.    Some people refuse that man miss undrestood the original language of God's word.  They believe that the Bible they have is perfect.  A little bit of research would clear that up.

Z1NSMOywaa	You have a couple misconceptions here. The first is that the African slaves were tribal Pagans before they were captured. Most of the population of the west coast of Africa had converted to Islam long before the Portuguese slave-traders arrived there. So basically the African slaves were forced to convert from one middle-eastern monotheism to another, which wasn't that big of a stretch.  Second, while "Christendom" usually refers to western Europe, Jesus himself was not European, 2000 years of paintings to the contrary. The Sinai peninsula connects the Arabian peninsula with the African continent; so Jesus was as much "African" as anything. He was in fact a Palestinian Jew, neither "white" nor "black" as Americans usually mean that.  Many African Americans have returned to Islam to reclaim their African heritage. Some African Americans have returned to African forms of NeoPaganism, and some smaller number of African Americans have turned to Wicca and other forms of "white man's NeoPaganism", because it is beautiful and speaks to truths deeper than skin color. I remain Christian, because that is where I am called to remain.|`|dcWGYBfYaa	Christianity is an African religion.

Mankinds Creator was the one to choose the men whom he would inspire to write the 66 books of the Bible. And if he chose to use people with light-colored skin, that was his responsibility. But the Bibles message was not to be confined to white people.  Interestingly, Acts 13:1 speaks of a certain man named Niger, which name means black. He was one of the prophets and teachers of the congregation of Antioch, Syria.  The Bible is from our Creator, and he is impartial. (Acts 10:34,?35)  Gods Word holds out to people of all nations and tribes the opportunity to live forever here on earth under his Kingdom. (Rev. 7:9, 10, 17)|`|ZOifSvNhaa	I am an African American and a Christian. For starters Jesus is not a white man's god. He is the son of god. The same god that Moses and Abraham prayed to. They were not white. Being a christian is a way of life and that way of life directs me in what kinds of things are acceptable in worship      Christs teachings moved his followers to follow Bible teachings, which meant avoiding fornication, uncleanness, loose conduct, idolatry, practice of spiritism, enmities, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, contentions, . . . drunken bouts, revelries, and things like these. (Galatians 5:19-21; Ephesians 4:17-24)     The apostle Paul reminded Corinthian Christians that some of them had once practiced these very things. Then he added: But you have been washed clean, but you have been sanctified, but you have been declared righteous in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.1 Corinthians 6:9-11.      The tribal religions of my ancestors was and is based on many of these things specifically spiritism and the occult. These things are unclean.     E. W. Barnes relates in his book The Rise of Christianity: In its early authoritative documents the Christian movement is represented as essentially moral and law-abiding. Its members desired to be good citizens and loyal subjects. They shunned the failings and vices of paganism. In private life they sought to be peaceful neighbours and trustworthy friends. They were taught to be sober, industrious and clean-living. Amid prevailing corruption and licentiousness they were, if loyal to their principles, honest and truthful. Their sexual standards were high: the marriage tie was respected and family life was pure. Such were aspects of being a Christian in the early days.    The laws of Christianity protects me from sexually transmitted diseses and evill spirits that can be conjured up through many of the religious rights my ancestors practiced.|`|vNGjgygCaa	Don't blame them Delusion has no Race or Creed.|`|FByBcUeeaa	Psssst, Zen Jews are African Americans, Ghetto is a Jewish word.

However it did spread to majority of whites, since its in europe, so on tht your already wrong.  Also jesus says love thy enemy, not to mention jesus never said chrisitanity was made for whites, he opened upa religion to every person, including blacks, whites,indians and chinese.    Then the whole african follwing white mens values is wrong bcuz as said jesus wasn't white as people potray him to be, its like siddhartha, he was indian but most ppl think of him as chinese its cultural diffusion.

SEE: * Romans 8:14-23 *<br>  <br>  SECOND OF ALL: HE WILL RETURN *FOR* His people, as per the First Resurrection and the Rapture of the remaining Church at that same moment.<br>  <br>  THIRDLY: *after* the Wrath of The Lamb against the Beast and the antichrist & his kingdoms, JESUS WILL RETURN *WITH* His people to rule and reign forever with them upon the earth and through ALL creation, Heaven included.<br>  <br>  * At the end of the Millennial Reign: there will be a FINAL PURGING and sifting. ... then: Eternity will dawn *without one trace of evil or willful sin & rebellion.* ... at that time: EVERYTHING will be restored to pristine perfection and glory.<br>  <br>   ALL glory to The Lamb.<br>   =================|`|qT3GrDRDaa	1= Acts 2 tells of the Holy Spirit coming to fill the believers (sorry about the Muslims that think that Mohamad is the comforter he promised in John 14-16th chapters which is told to be the Holy Spirit as well.<br>  <br>  2=the rapture of the saints/believers  Acts 1:11 that he shall appear in the clouds as we have seen him go into heaven.<br>  <br>  3= from the book of Revelations and Daniel<br>  the comming at the end of the great tribulation and the battle of armagedon and continues through the millenium, when satan is released, and final judement comes, and heaven comes to earth.|`|8cuPVvYnaa	Yes, this is what I see in the word, as you have stated. The only thing I am unsure about is what you said about it being in a matter of months. Not denying this is true however. The Bible says no man knows the hour but the Father. But it also says that those living in the light won't be taken by surprise as others. So I believe we should have a pretty good sense about the times we are in. And I don't mind at all you wording it such. Whatever encourages me and others to be ready. Thank you brother! I'd like to hear more.|`|HDbMh2YBaa	Jesus will come back at the right hand of the Father accompanied by the Holy angels to defeat the antichrist. He wont be coming back in three separate events. <br>  <br>  Jesus will return at the end of the 7 year tribulation period. Some things I dont quite get but here it is. At the end of the 7 year period he will destroy the throne of the antichrist and set up his kingdom. All those who followed the antichrist will suffer rath and be held in hades until the great white throne judgement. But after Christ returns there will be one more battle in which God devours his enemies with fire. Now where these enemies come from I dont know. But satan gathers up these armies to surround where the New Jerusalem will be. But it really isnt a battle because they all will be destroyed. Then satan will be condemned to eternal punishment and all who followed him will be subject to the great white throne judgement. What I dont understand is after Christ destroys the antichrist's throne, where does satan find these people to stir up and attack the city of God?|`|09NVlpQPaa	When Jesus comes back there will be two comings, if that makes sense. 1st, will be for the believers and the dead. He will sound a trumpet and the dead will arise and we will be taken up in a flash. The 2nd coming is after the 7 yrs of tribulation to call all of the final believers. Then the devil will be chained up for 1000 yrs and we will live for eternity. <br>  Jesus is a spirit, so I'm guessing that is what the author meant. The thief, as I said earlier, "and we will be takin up in a flash". We will be taken like a theif takes stuff in a flash. The Bible says that when Jesus comes He will be like a theif in the night. We will not know when He will come. The third i sort of answered. I hope this somewhat answered ur question.

So to me, that means in like 1-2.5 seconds. They say as a "thief in the night" meaning that the people will be taken away from their loved ones suddenly and unexpectedly. I'm honestly not sure where Jesus will be between the time he comes to pick up his believers and the time he comes back to reign his 1,000 year kingdom (in heaven, I assume?) but his 3rd coming on the Earth, he (according to Tim LaHaye & Jerry Jenkins) will head a great heavenly army -- complete with those of the angels and saints/believers -- and come destroy Satan with the sword of his mouth (meaning, the word of God). Then Satan will be locked in a dungeon-liked thing while Jesus rules the Millenium Kindgom for 1,000 years. And then what? I don't know, you tell me.|`|pSCHJJ7raa	According to 1 Thes. 4 when Jesus comes it will be with a shout and the trumpet of God will sound so loud it will wake the dead. The dead in Christ will rise first then we which are alive and remain will join them in the air. Revelation says that when He comes every eye shall see Him. It is the time of His coming that is as a thief in the night not Jesus acting as a thief. The unsaved will be destroyed by the brightness of His coming. The earth will be desolate according to Jeremiah. Satan will be bound a thousand years on this desolate earth with no one to tempt because the saved will be in Heaven with Jesus during that thousand years. The unsaved will be dead. The bottomless pit Satan is cast into is the same word that we get our word abyss from, the same condition the earth was is in the beginning on Genesis (the Spirit of the Lord was upon the face of the "deep"). Acts says that this same Jesus will come in like manner as you have seen Him leave. His coming will be literal, He will come physically in the body He left with, He will come in the clouds. Thessalonians says it will be loud. Revelation says it will be visible. There is nothing secret about it. At the end of the thousand years the New Jerusalem will descend from Heaven and God  will make His home here on the New Earth with His redeemed for all eternity. The last chapters of Revelation tells how the earth will be restored as it was before the fall.|`|9YMLsk7Taa	It has absolute merit, the Bible is incapable of lying because it is the word of God, all these things are in the Bible.|`|TMb076n6aa	There will be 2 commings and I like your questions

It's an identifiable pain that you can associate with physical hurt rather than dealing with the mental hurt that you're going through.

Also I do suggest talking to a therapist, you could also talk to a school counselor. I used to talk to mine all the time in high school...if that's not an option- seek professional help.

eb4e977a0cb9ce50b08bf74f0f3a0c61aa	Here is truth - read and understand. Vampires, defined as a humanoid being that MUST consume blood or energy to survive, and Werewolves, defined as a humanoid being that changes shape to that of a wolf, or half-human hybrid, do not exist. Cut and paste time, as it is too much work to type this out over and over and I "recycle" my own answers instead of retyping them so here goes.    The humans who profess to be vampires are victims of an all-encompassing self induced delusion. They are as human as you or I, regardless of their claims, and if they ingest HIV tainted blood they can most certainly contract the disease, esp. if they have any cuts, sores, or lesions in and or around their mouth. It is a very dangerous delusion to be laboring under. Note that there is absolutely no scientific or medical proof that these people derive any benefit at all from the ingestion of blood, and even worse are the so-called "psychic" vampires, because their delusion is one that they cannot substantiate with any concrete evidence at all.     There is no "vampire" gene. People are not "born" as vampires. When a woman goes to the hospital for prenatal care there are many tests done on mother and child, even while still in the womb, to check for many things, including genetic anomalies that result in deformities and birth defects. If such a gene existed, in today's world with today's technology it would have been found - we have already completely sequenced the human genome. It would also have to follow Mendel's law of dominant/recessive gene theory. Again, the odds on that many "vampires" all escaping the notice of the medical/scientific community are so low as to be almost nonexistent.     There is no "vampire virus" - as I have already pointed out, HIV is a virus, and look at how fast it has spread - virtually everyone knows someone with the affliction. According to the "vampire websites" there are "thousands" of vampires running around. If that was so then at least one of them has ended up in a hospital for bloodwork when they became pregnant, had a bloodborne infection, was injured in a car wreck, etc, etc, ad nauseum. The anomaly would have been detected and medical science would have isolated it, studied it, applied for research grants on it, published papers on it, and turned it into the talk of the medical and scientific community, as well as making its "discoverers" celebrities and rich beyond their dreams. A virus cannot alter your DNA in such a radical fashion without killing you.    Werewolves do not exist. For a humanoid to drastically alter his form and shape in so quick a time would require miraculous reshaping, growth, and loss of bone and skeletal structures, a complete rearranging of all vital organs and the circulatory system that supplies them, a redistribution of the neurological system, growth and loss of heart and brain tissue, a total repatterning of the DNA in every molecule, and a genetic change in every hair follicle to produce fur, as well as the spontaneous generation of millions more hair follicles. Such a change would be so excruciatingly painful it would kill the person changing, probably by a heart attack as the person went into systemic shock.  The brain tissue point is most important, because once you lose brain tissue, you lose the memories stored there, as well as impairing normal functions. Once a werewolf changed back, he would still only have the mental capacity of a wolf, and would be a drooling idiot at best, and a homicidal animal at worst.    I am a Nurse, real education, real experience. My answer is completely based on my knowledge and training, and is not copied from any outside source.|`|Qa3yKIoDaa	UGH twilight has brainwashed you all!|`|AA10810835	The answer is yes, but no, because you can be born a werewolf, but it isn't required to become a werewolf.    You wanna know the real truth, I know it may sound far-fetched but that's the truth (in biological language...).    Never seen a vampire, but when it comes to a werewolf, you have to note werewolves are half-lives, which means they are part-spirit and part-biological beings (trapped between life and death, Earth-bound spirits).  The half-kinds are infected by a DNA virus (possibly) that turns their bacteria into spiritually (via electromagnetic brain-waves) controllable DNA, this provides alteration, when the werewolf wants to turn into a werewolf, or something makes them shape-shift into one, the DNA reforms their body and brain in a normally short-period, and then back again after a certain time, or due to a trigger.  The mind can send signals via the brain, into the body of DNA via ether-bound electromagnetic waves, enabling transmogrification to and from one or more kinds, we are not too sure whether ectoplasm is a good word for it, but it suits description, if so, the ectoplasmic reaction via spiritual / electromagnetic wave enables the DNA to metabolise, enabling metamorphosise to take place.  If the half-kind DNA can travel in reproduction, you can be born as a werewolf. I guess vampires could also be half-kind, so bare it in mind.    echo javascript . thumbs(0,4);|`|jLL7sDILaa	Yes. At least for real vampires, you must be born one.|`|12xkgxYdaa	yes you have to be born one but being around one can bring about your awakening if you are one at least for vamps not sure about weres|`|T0E8BOSzaa	I am a vampire, i first awakend at 13 years old but was born a vampire.    Iv heard of turnings but have yet to see one. I dont think its possibal. Its something you have to be born into as far as i know.
97f3e02ea0c61fb5033e4520729f2781aa	It's the product of someone who isn't as smart as they think they are.  In order to not have a dying society - it's necessary to have some 2.7 children per family - any less than that and the population begins decreasing.  It's one of the reasons many European nations are looking at having muslim majorities in the next 20-50 years.  The natives are not keeping the birthrate high enough to replace the population and the immigrants have 2-3x the birthrate... and that's just the non-religious perspective.    From a religious perspective - it's abhorrent and evil to restrict the agency not only in regards to reproduction, but to force those families to participate in murder [aka abortion] is beyond words.|`|c85dfb73b5d99dcbc373b5a788901bc7aa	Tough question. I want to say no, but there are exceptions to every rule. For example, what if you had a couple who had six children already, and it was discovered that all six were being horrendously abused? What if the population of an area is so high that there's an infant mortality rate of 98% due to starvation?    Children are a gift from God, but so is common sense.|`|vNGjgygCaa	If they are a Gift from God then why do Children grow up to die?    They don't teach you that at Church now do they?    Also if Children are a Gift from "god" then why do Christian and Catholics against having sex before marriage?|`|bnPPrJY1aa	If you can support a lot of kids, no problem.|`|AA11636949	if we were limited to 2 children I wouldn't exist. I am the 3rd born of 7. I have 5 children of my own. My perspective is this. If you can support your children and be able to feed, clothe and shelter them without the assistance of the government(i.e. food stamps and medicaid) then have as many as you want. It's no ones "right" to tell anyone when enough is enough.|`|yN3fWUCuaa	Of course it should not be compulsory, but I think the "gift from God" line wears a bit thin when a couple is on their 4th or 5th kid.  Why not adopt some of the other "gifts" no one appears to want?|`|6106bf75a443c7ad47b50d9b2b1cadc6aa	I think the Government should only give Child Benefit for just  "Two "   children no matter how many more you go on to have. I feel it would bring on a Sense of Family planning to  the Newly weds .Then no one can complain of .............|`|EAjTiYj0aa	I think it's tricky.     I don't like the idea of governments telling people how many kids to have.     On the other hand the world population is too high - nearly 7 billion now -  and the worlds agriculture system and economy already can't keep everyone fed and housed and so on and we're devastating the environment and other species we share the planet with more and more each year. The worlds population is still increasing fast. So something does need to be done to cut the human population quite a bit.|`|86Pctmyvaa	The world is overpopulated! All countries should make it law that once a man has fathered 2 kids he should be forced to have a vasectomy. Once a woman has had 2 kids she should be forced to have a hysterectomy. Implanting more than one embryo during fertility therapy should be banned. People who commit violent crime should be made to have a vasectomy or hysterectomy regardless of whether they have had children yet.    That will cut the population a lot and maybe save the world.|`|KRTPJP2baa	God has nothing to do with it. We are just a particular species of animal on this planet that at the rate we are going will run out of food and habitable areas if nothing is done to curb the population rise. Unfortunately contraception is not supported by the RC church that has a considerable influence in some of the World's poorest areas. Actually the RC church has done nothing for the advancement of humanity and probably never will. All religions are based on fear of the unknown and the sooner the human race accepts we are a result of physics, chemistry and evolution then possibly we can all face up to the fact that a calamity is waiting to happen.|`|2gyJUTzRaa	we shouldn't force people to limit how many children they have.    what we should do is have public servace announcements about population control run regularly on TV.  also have it taught in schools that people do need to stop having so many kids.|`|QLDMmp6Taa	Nope.|`|D1BNSf5uaa	Yes, I'm sick of paying taxes that go to people's 16-year-old daughters who refused to use birth control.|`|KWwW7N49aa	Not generally, but if they are irresponsible something should be done.  Like the single lady who delivered 8 babies (fertility drug) recently and already has 6. That is 14 kids.  Her parents say she just loves kids.  I hope she has someone who can help her take care of them.|`|q5rTjkjgaa	it is a tough question but soon we will have to we are overpopulating the earth now there are over 6 trillion people and if we keep having nine children we will HAVE to set limits so i would be for it|`|WUjlEuTtaa	I don't think anyone should have the right to limit or decide a persons reproductive choices...|`|rhuDGMlzaa	People should have and do what they want. That's why we have so many problems everyone trying to control everyone. Why can't we all just live the way we want to.|`|Y3Z6B7dHaa	it's a lame idea. in first world countries birth rates are low enough that it's not an issue.|`|Rn4GXoJAaa	the pro-choice camp will stop at nothing, you can be sure of that.     children are no longer seen as a blessing, but as a burden, largely because of the fall out of the "womens rights movement" which told women that motherhood is a curse.    God forgive us.|`|315e05cc268b43fe093093a9e96280b8aa	No person or government should be able to limit procreation, but common sense should.  The world is overpopulated as it is and we as individuals should take this into consideration as we were given the responsibility to care for it.  Children are no doubt a gift from God.  Thanks for sharing.|`|GWB1R0jQaa	Wow, that would be horrible - being forced to kill your own children!! When I grow up (I'm gonna be a fireman!! Sorry, it came out, ignore that) I'm going to adopt all my children. It's a personal choice, of course, but I leave there are already enough children who don't have someone in this world, why bring more in??|`|3GAiVmEAaa	I am pro choice, and that goes both ways. I am not pro-abortion. I think it is wrong to force women to do anything with their uterus, whether it is force them to carry a child for a full term (I do think it is reasonable to have them make up their minds in the first month or two), and I don't think someone should be forced to have an abortion.    I think people should be smart about it though. If they have a bunch of kids and they can't care for another it is time for sterilization.    But again that is a personal choice. I just don't see any way to support that without someone sacrificing their rights.
4INE794zaa	They already are, they just don't advertise it. What does the US think all the other countries are doing while they are wasting billions of dollars in Iraq and Afghanistan.........building their National Defences. Stockpiling, gathering resources. The world is going to be in for some big surprises very soon.|`|TEsq9K54aa	Nope, we won't let them.  But we'll use them to take out China when they, China,  become too dangerous...the Japanese owe us that.  .|`|SwKPJRNvaa	It is still the second biggest economy, but its economy has not really grown since the 80s, and its population is declining.    Japan is at its zenith of power now, and will not become a superpower.  The USA is often called the lonely superpower. China is becoming one too, but has a way to go before it rivals US and is called a superpower.|`|61ddfb6410cdb1fde97533401cf0a601aa	will be nothing without us.|`|ooCvJWPHaa	Yes.|`|EXurNsB4aa	Japan is already an economic superpower.|`|GzJOW8NWaa	Japan has been (and still is) an economic superpower. The fact they've been in economic decline the past decade or so may be sullied that image tho..|`|AhO0Uoppaa	china  india  then japan
EXurNsB4aa	Right, but when Portugal was at its peak, hugely populous countries like the USA and China weren't empowered by globalization and trading and consumer societies and stuff.  The USA didn't even exist yet.  Brazil was once its colony, now it's a huge player in the world.  Portugal was a power because it allied with other nations and because it colonized 'new' lands and had control of the wealth of their natural resources.  It didn't really have much to do with its size in area or its population-- all of the colonies it occupied multiplied its amount of land and subjects/people.    A small nation won't be able to overpower huge ones with enormous economies and military power alone unless something drastic changes.  So yes, it's /possible/, but I don't know who I would finger as the next David opposing the Goliaths we have now.|`|5esm3e1Baa	Smaller nations will not need to defeat larger nations in a military sense, as there are other means of 'conquering' other nations.    To truly conquer a nation, you simply have to send wealthy migrants to the target country, whereupon they buy up or set up businesses, initally employing locals.  Over the next ten-twenty years, you then bring in poorer migrants and offer them work, in place of locals.    As the migrants establish themselves and begin to integrate more, they then spread out into the rest of the country and begin to exert more influence.    Within 50-100 years, migrants could conceivably account for up to 70 percent of the population of the target country.  Given further expansion and a reduction in the former indigenous population, the migrants would eventually be the majority (at all levels) and the goal of conquest would be achieved.|`|ToztjpAsaa	Portugal was powerful at a time when military might was measured by the size of a country's navy.  Empires were built by the British, French, Portuguese, Spanish, and others on the back of their large naval and merchant fleets.  Also, at that time, a population of 1 million would have been quite respectable.|`|l3EVUl91aa	depends on the weapons and technology i guess, but i doubt it, not in the forseeable future, smaller countrys just take sides.

For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone; but each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed."<br>  <br>  James 4:7 says, "Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you." <br>  <br>  Why would our Father in Heaven, who knows all things, lead us into temptation? <br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 10:13 says, "No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it." <br>  <br>  God doesn't tempt us, but He allows us to be put into situations where our faith is tested and strengthened.|`|ftnMEAv6aa	Miss Friendly: The Devil is truly real and by saying that, it's him deceiving you.<br>  <br>  -------<br>  <br>  <br>  I will definitely pray for you!! Just as a reminder, if you read the bible, which I'm sure you do.<br>  <br>  Matthew 5:30:<br>  And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell.<br>  <br>  So if there's a certain thing in your life that causing you to sin, then you need to cut it out of your life completly. Like for me, it was music that had cussing, sexual terms and just talked about ungodly things and God showed me that it was causing me to sin, cuss and I was falling into temptation so I only listen to praise music now and I don't feel tempted anymore... from that subject. Haha, just always remember, God is bigger than the devil so always go to Him! :))|`|bADza5pRaa	The Devil putting thoughts in your head is natural. Its when you start to act on these thoughts is when you have to start worrying.  Just pray to God to keep you strong.|`|d3P8dE4naa	i will pray for you!! and may God not lead you into temptation!<br>  <br>  may God bless you!|`|1329f1db299d1eef26b268070f628aecaa	Of course, I am free of that. Only Christians fall into temptation. And all kind of believers too.|`|LYIsfJJJaa	sure|`|AA11849917	Jesus taught us how to pray, and part of His "model" prayer included these words, "Lead me not into temptation, but deliver me from evil ... "<br>  <br>  But God will not force anybody to obey Him.  This would be tantamount to "spiritual rape."<br>  <br>  God wants us to join Him in the struggle against sin.<br>  <br>  It's like the story of the flea and the elephant who wanted to break down a man-made bridge into their part of the jungle, so they got into the middle of the bridge and both of them started jumping up and down as hard as they could until the bridge started to collapse.<br>  <br>  Back on their side of the bridge, the elephant told the flea, "We did a great job together."<br>  <br>  That's the kind of cooperation God wants from us.  While the flea's efforts amounted to absolutely nothing, the elephant worked with the flea to accomplish the task at hand.<br>  <br>  As one evangelist once said, "Work as though everything depends on you, then pray as though everything depends on God."<br>  <br>  God bless you in your efforts to follow Him and obey Him.<br>  <br>  And, by the way, yes.  I do, even now, pray that God's grace would be sufficient for you to overcome the temptations, and that you would fall on His Love and stand in His grace.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	I hear that.

Even if this guy completely resembles the first jerk, he is a different person.    You should confront this situation, and if you are concerned about a negative response do so tactfully.    perhaps "Hey, I don't mean to be rude, but it makes me uncomfortable when you stare at me."  Say it when you catch him, that way he can't deny that he does it... at least logically.    Have your cell phone handy, and if he yells at you or makes you feel intimidated in anyway, call the police.  Intimidation is a form of harassment.

d0945a07b59dce3ca7393bc610216aa9aa	I'm so very sorry about your loss. You obviously love your husband very much, and your love was surely a very important part of his life: you were his partner, his support, his strength. I believe you were chosen to be his companion in a life that tragically would be cut short: you are the one he needed to sustain him through his pain and suffering. You're very special indeed.    There's no doubt in my mind that the two of you have a past history in other times and places, and that you have future lives ahead - happier ones, longer ones. Don't let anyone try to convince you that love doesn't live forever: it does, and we do, too.     "I have been here before, but when or how I cannot tell:  I know the grass beyond the door, The sweet keen smell, the sighing sound, the lights around the shore. You have been mine before - How long ago I may not know:  But just when at that swallow's soar, your neck turned so,  Some veil did fall, - I knew it all of yore." - Dante Gabriel Rossetti    "When I see nothing annihilated, and not even a drop of water wasted, I cannot suspect the annihilation of souls Thus finding myself to exist in the world, I believe I shall, in some shape or other, always exist; with all the inconveniences human life is liable to, I shall not object to a new edition of mine; hoping, however, that the errata of the last may be corrected." - Benjamin Franklin    "The idea of a succession of lives for each human creature would be no more debatable to the average Hindu than a Westerner's fixed belief that the continuity from childhood to adulthood exists in a single life." - Nancy Ross    "Rebirth is an affirmation that must be counted among the primordial affirmations of mankind. The concept of rebirth necessarily implies the continuity of personality. Here the human personality is regarded as continuous and accessible to memory, so that, when one is incarnated or born, one is able, potentially, to remember that one has lived through previous existences, and that these existences were one's own, ie, they had the same ego form as the present life. As a rule, reincarnation means rebirth in a human body." - Carl G. Jung    "Know, therefore, that from the greater silence I shall return Forget not that I shall come back to you A little while, a moment of rest upon the wind, and another woman shall bear me." - Kahlil Gibran    "A person whose life's vision is limited to this one fleeting incarnation is like the plow horse which views it's life's work as a single furrow. Not able to appreciate how one furrow blends with the many others. Not able to understand why there are rocks in the furrow. Not able to why the furrow is so hard to plow." - Bryan Jameison    "I have been born more times than anybody except Krishna." - Mark Twain     "So as through a glass and darkly, the age long strife I see,  Where I fought in many guises, many names, but always me." - General George S. Patton    "I am certain that I have been here as I am now a thousand times before, and I hope to return a thousand times." - Thomas Huxley    "As far back as I can remember I have unconsciously referred to the experiences of previous existences." - Henry David Thoreau    "... I am the same personal being who in old times upon the Earth had those experiences." - William James ("Human Immortality")    "Reincarnation is implicit in the manifested universe and is a basic and fundamental." - Alice A. Bailey    "It is no more surprising to be born once than to be born twice: everything in nature is resurrection." - Francois Voltaire    "The most promising evidence bearing on reincarnation seems to come from the spontaneous cases, especially among children." - Ian Stevenson    "It is a strong proof of men knowing most things before birth, that when mere children they grasp innumerable facts with such speed as to show that they are not then taking them in for the first time, but are remembering and recalling them." - Marcus Tullius Cicero    "Have you never observed that children will sometimes, of a sudden, give utterance to ideas which makes us wonder how they got possession of them? Which presuppose a long series of other ideas and secret self-communings? Which break forth like a full stream out of the earth, an infallible sign that the stream was not produced in a moment from a few raindrops, but had long been flowing concealed beneath the ground?" - J. G. Herder    "You would know the hidden realm where all souls dwell.  The journey's way lies through death's misty fell.  Within this timeless passage, a guiding light does dance.  Lost from conscious memory but visible in trance." - Michael Newton ("Journey of Souls")    "Every new born being indeed comes fresh and blithe into the new existence, and enjoys it as a free gift: but there is, and can be, nothing freely given. It's fresh existence is paid for by the old age and death of a worn out existence which has perished, but which contained the indestructible seed out of which the new existence has arisen: they are one being." - Arthur Schopenhauer    "Why should it be thought incredible that the same soul should inhabit in succession an indefinite number of moral bodies? Even during this one life our bodies are perpetually changing, through a process of decay and restoration; which is so gradual that it escapes our notice. Every human being thus dwells successively in many bodies, even during one short life." - Francis Bowen     "As long as you are not aware of the continual law of Die and Be Again, you are merely a vague guest on a dark Earth." - Johann Wolfgang von Goethe    "He who fears death either fears the loss of sensation or a different kind of sensation. But if thou shalt have no sensation, neither wilt thou feel any harm; and if thou shalt acquire anot|`|DRSv6SOLaa	Sorry. No such thing as 'reincarnation'.|`|4WqvTAfmaa	Please accept my condolence on your loss.    As for reincarnation, there is a very reasonable chance you will have another opportunity to complete your mutual tasks and love in another lifetime. There seems to be a tendency for groupings of people to end up more or less in the same time and place in life after life. This is fairly well accepted among most people who are not engaged in the Christian, Jewish and Islamic worlds.     I have two very good friends who were kept apart by a first marriage for one, during which the other waited patiently, in this lifetime. They had both been born on the same day, in the same city. Finally, they came together again, married, and had 5 wonderful years together. I believe they brought much of their love forward from a previous life.     The husband had a serious stroke about 5 years ago, and he has not been the same since. Only part of him is there. We all miss the rest, but still value what remains. I am certain they will come together again in another life. They work hard for what they feel is important, spiritually, and their work will not be completed in one lifetime.     Best wishes in your continuing quest for love, hope and life.|`|NqOxQzlraa	There is no reincarnation (I don't remember my previous life, also see Hebrews 9:27 from a Christian perspective).  However, if you're of the same religion I'm inclined to believe you'll be in the same place after death.|`|8rbQBaIeaa	Reincarnation, literally "to be made flesh again", is a doctrine or metaphysical belief that some essential part of a living being (in some variations only human beings) survives death to be reborn in a new body. This essential part is often referred to as the spirit or soul, the "higher" or "true" self, "divine spark", or "I". According to such beliefs, a new personality is developed during each life in the physical world, but some part of the self remains constant throughout the successive lives.[1]    I personally don't believe in reincarnation as I believe that we will all be reunited in Heaven. Being cheated by the death of your husband? OR Were you blessed to find someone who you connected with, devoted to, and totally in love with. Were you blessed to have the moments you had together and to have found a love that was and still will always be cherished. Death is not fair, death hurts those who were left behind.  Death is a part of life. Your husband passed, but the memories will always be alive. Keep those memories alive .....|`|7mhRDbvsaa	its a 1 to 50 000 chance|`|sW6lxVFOaa	Life is like that.|`|cZcLjTLgaa	If any knew they would be a higher power  If any claim to know they are a puffed up self important dumbass

It sounds like you do really like her but you need to talk to her  and let her know that you care for her but you are gay/  you don't like her "that way".  She obviously likes you a lot willing to take you back even at this point.  Even though you may want her when your broken up  maybe you just want what you can not have.  I know your trying to figure things out  but your hurting her feelings and probably confusing her.  If your  her friend be honest to her and let her know   because you don't want to hurt her or have her   still wanting you when your not even interested.  good luck :)

At the end of the month I'm moving to a safer location to weather the storm, (so to speak).  Crime will increase for awhile until Government stimulus kicks in.  I'm still somewhat in shock that I saw this coming and no one else did.  I don't understand why they didn't.  All the signs were there.  I seen them.  Am I to understand that all these great leaders don't know how to read the future?  Wow.  I guess I missed my calling but, if I had tried to warn anyone, I would have been called a fool.

The greatest preparation is to have a relationship with the Lord Jesus!  Being used to His ...(sometimes), still small voice!    No matter what challenges we face... we are reminded, (as Christians),  (Jesus wants us to be anxious for Nothing)!  He said to "Fear Not"!  We that choose to follow Him will have our path illuminated!  When I have concerns...I remind myself that Jesus is my "sustenance!  (Not the place where I work, not my husband, not my relatives, etc.)!!!  Jesus will not leave us or forsake us!  His grace and mercies endureth forever!  He will go through our trials with us!

Daniel 8:19-25  19And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be.   20The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of Media and Persia.   21And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn that is between his eyes is the first king.   22Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his power.   23And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.   24And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise, and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.   25And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.     History will show you that the only 4 nations to rule the entire world was the Babylonian, Medo-Persian, Greek and Romans. The 1st 3 are gone and the military side of the Romans, but since the Romans had their own religion(Catholicism) they never really died. Now in the EEU the Roman Empires deadly wound is almost healed and Great Tribulation is rapidly approaching.    Daniel 2:44  44And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.     2 Timothy 3:1-4,7  1This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.   2For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,   3Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,   4Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;   7Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.    2 Timothy 4:3-5  3For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;  4And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables.  5But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.|`|D1BNSf5uaa	Wow, I thought you got suspended.

Some of us are cautiously hopeful, and actively working to insure that we won't get into this same situation again.  Frankly, I think that's better than any of your three options.    A glaring problem with your "queston" : if the "holy spirit"  guides us, then how is it that we got into this mess in the first place?  With a president that said he talked directly to god (and god to him), with so many so-called "leaders" that are christians...?  Did the "holy spirit" lead us right into this "continuing disaster?"  Or gee, maybe it was greedy people (most of them avowed christians) and lax regulation?    That's some hopeful attitude you have -- things will get worse.  Guess you really *don't* believe the "holy spirit" is going to lead us, huh?    Me, I prefer to rationally conclude that with hard work, efficient government, and fairness for all people we can work our way out of our problems...without needing mythical spirits or made-up gods.

This is what all this mess is about, in order for us to be on the same page as other countries we need to be a third world country and we are heading there now with all the big debt the government has given us. Then they will want to change our money again, to comform with the world paper money. They are just waiting to install that chip in our bodies and then they will know every move you are making. And what about everyone having to have a box in their homes in order for them to be able to watch TV. Why is that and it has been pushed on everyone. What is in this box that we need it in our homes? No one seems to question anything the government is coming out with. We are like sheep being lead to the slaughter. My question is will all these so called government officials have the chip also? I really want to know! God bless you.|`|EBGdlo35aa	1) Do you see a One World Government happening as the Bible Speaks about?     Just the opposite - increasing division.  For example, the Chechnyans, the Kurds, the Scots (there is a movement to remove themselves from the United Kingdom), the Quebecans (ditto, from Canada), etc. etc.      2) "global governance"    This term does NOT refer to the idea of "one world government" but, rather, certain particular regulations that might be applied worldwide - much the same as the international crimes court or the world bank are already.  This concept does NOT usurp or replace the authority of any existing government.    There just talking about funding international projects with international tax revenues - not running the entire world with a single government.  Any nation who wants to get it on such a plan will have to sign on voluntarily.  They're not going to arrest Obama if he decides not to pay international taxes.

We are headed in that direction now.  The stats and information that you have provided speaks to that very thing that will happen.  It is the sign of the times we are living in.  However the one world government won't come into place until after all Christians are raptured when Jesus returns for the 2nd coming.  The evidence is clear.  Look at our current economic situation.  Money such as the dollar has lost massive value over time.  A couple of months ago when the stock market crashed it hit world wide.  What does that tell you?  That lets me know that money is all connected.  In order for the one world government to be implemented money such as the dollar, yen, and Euro will have to be done away with.  When the anti-christ sets up his reign during that period of the tribulation time, he will have the mark of the beast.  It will be a symbol which no man can buy or sell without.  That is how the one world government comes into play when our government fails and banks continue to fail now.  So the signs are there, we just have to make sure we are ready and informed.|`|5M0FBU89aa	Yes,  and we may see it in our lifetime.  But man, if you think law is complicated NOW....    It would probably go more towards separate unions, EU, NAFTA (with teeth), and Asian Union.    THEN - Pan-Asian union (which failed some time ago) and then towards a world union.

kZ8jIStBaa	Yes, I pray for you people, always.<br>  <br>  But look at the positive side.<br>  The exiled Tibetan leader Dalai Lama has caused a revival of Buddhism in places that no one thought possible. More and more Europeans are converting to Tibetan way of Buddhism. Perhaps so much popularity of Buddhism would not have been possible if he would have remained in Tibet even after 1959.<br>  <br>  Also look at the Uyghur Muslim population (Xinjiang). Their land too was occupied by China in 1949, they are as much persecuted lot as Tibetans, but not much of global voice has been raised in there support. Most don't even know about them.<br>  <br>  Dalai Lama is really a great leader, a great spiritual Guru, and even though I am not much of fan of Buddhism, I respect him.<br>  <br>  And always believe in the power of miracles.<br>  Who could predict that Soviet Union will disintegrate? But it did.<br>  Who could predict that Jews against all the odds will get their homeland in the form of Israel? But Israel happened.<br>  Who could predict that Berlin wall will come apart? It did.<br>  <br>  Surely a miracle in Tibet is not impossible, no matter what time it takes.

AyEkA6Flaa	I agree with Dust1n's take.    As a friend, he certainly is caring if he took care of you when you were sick.  But the move into the slow dance is really suggestive to me.  He is either totally unafraid of what others think, or he put some thought into that transition, hoping to hold you close.    He may be unsure of his orientation, curious, and wanting to experiment with you.  Or he may realize that he loves you more deeply than the girls he has been with.  Or he may just be hoping for some friendly sex.    But...slow dances are romantic.  That implies to me he does have romantic feelings about you.    Ask him if he wants to practice the slow dance with you again.  =P    But before doing anything romantic, be sure to talk it out, and make sure you are on the same page as to what this means.  Is it an experiment?  Boyfriends?  Does he want the same kind of sexual contact you do?  Is this a fling or could it grow into a long-term relationship?    If you thought he was going to kiss you, you are probably right.    OMG, you just put down the part about holding you all night.  Wow, he really does love you.  I've known only one straight guy my entire life who is that secure in his sexuality -- and I'm not even sure he is totally straight.  I'd say your roomie is likely bi or even gay.    He's either as close as any brother, or kinda in love with you.  Our life and culture being what they are, I'm leaning toward him being kinda in love with you.|`|fbBNdmF1aa	first of all, i think thats adorable!  and i think he does.  maybe hes gay or figuring out hes gay and sort of in denial  or it could be just a sorta guy crush  i know a lot of girls have girl crushes but aren't bi/lesbian  so give it some more time and you might find out for certain :)|`|BAf9SMULaa	Sounds like he does. Maybe. If situations like the one you just described keep popping up, he probably likes you.|`|6SwaWSoyaa	This is a really adorable situation.  When I go to college, I hope I have a similar roomie.  Here's the deal...it could be one.    a) he just really likes to dance  b) he likes you and thought he would try to make an inadvertent move on you.  c) all of the above and in that case you could try to make a move on him, especially if he knows you are gay, but don't go too far unless you know for sure.  d) you should have hit the friend who knocked on the door for ruining the moment.    *throws an apple at the interloper*|`|9O3prIUpaa	Omg.  I ******* love stuff like this.  He definitely sounds gay, but I wouldn't talk about it with him out loud.  Just... try to get him alone again.    Let me know what happens for sure.|`|wbfw04xPaa	I'd say so, any straight young guy willing to slow dance with another guy "seriously" is either the most secure person on the planet or definitely looking for more. He may just be confused too..  But if he knows you are gay, and still did the this then he is definitely looking for something whether it be something strictly physical or more I couldn't say.     Also at this point i dont think you need to be worried about making a move, judging by the experience I would bet he will be making his own soon enough.|`|gayOzkdYaa	An opportunity where you end up with a roommate that might like you doesn't come very often.

That should over come the shyness. Then once you start talking to her on a more intimate level u can flirt with her, and show her that you like her, cause trust me she flirts with you cause she must thinks something of you, so show her that you think something of her too, she cant read your mind.

Because from my point of view. When a girl told me she had a crush on me, and I dont really like her, i would still messing around and flirting with her even though im not very interested. It just gives me this feeling of being more superior. Sorry! just speaking from my point of view and the possibility.

The Supreme Lord can be preliminarily perceived by His different energies, and in this way He is realized impersonally. As the demigod in the sun is a person and is perceived by his all-pervading energy, the sunshine, similarly, the Lord, although in His eternal abode, is perceived by His all-pervading, diffusive energies. The taste of water is the active principle of water. No one likes to drink sea water because the pure taste of water is mixed with salt. Attraction for water depends on the purity of the taste, and this pure taste is one of the energies of the Lord. The impersonalist perceives the presence of the Lord in water by its taste, and the personalist also glorifies the Lord for His kindly supplying water to quench man's thirst. That is the way of perceiving the Supreme. Practically speaking, there is no conflict between personalism and impersonalism. One who knows God knows that the impersonal conception and personal conception are simultaneously present in everything and that there is no contradiction. Therefore Lord Caitanya established His sublime doctrine: acintya-bheda and abheda-tattvam--simultaneously one and different.<br>     The light of the sun and the moon is also originally emanating from the brahmajyoti, which is the impersonal effulgence of the Lord. Similarly pranava or the omkara transcendental sound used in the beginning of every Vedic hymn to address the Supreme Lord also emanates from Him. Because the impersonalists are very much afraid of addressing the Supreme Lord Krsna by His innumerable names, they prefer to vibrate the transcendental sound omkara. But they do not realize that omkara is the sound representation of Krsna. The jurisdiction of Krsna consciousness extends everywhere, and one who knows Krsna consciousness is blessed. Those who do not know Krsna are in illusion, and so knowledge of Krsna is liberation, and ignorance of Him is bondage.|`|AA11946554	Meditation is a 'quiet time' for yourself...you're supposed to let your mind go blank. <br>  'Om' or 'Aum' is (from what I know) a word to describe the 'perfect' sound.<br>  I don't know a lot about ity but I do know my grandmother does it at least once a day and everyone I've come across loves t and think it helps them to stay more focused and/or relaxed in high stress times.

Unfortunately, it didn't fit every culture -- some are virtually vegetarian or perhaps meat is so expensive that not eating meat on Fridays has no meaning. And of course, the act would have no meaning if one was a vegetarian.<br>  <br>  Since Vatican II, we are called to choose for ourselves, individually, an act of penance. So, the obligation to perform a penitential act every Friday, year round, remains though no specific act is determined. You'd be surprised how few Catholics are aware of this prescription.<br>  <br>  Of course, during Lent, no meat is eaten on Ash Wednesday or on Fridays. This allows the universal Church to observe a universal act of penance during the holy season of Lent.|`|bVHnNqzBaa	Most people take things too literally.

So u r probably thinking more about ur sexuality when around this girl, just cuz u r thinking about the possibilities of having a different sort of relationship with someone, so at the moment u r probably bi-curious, and its perfectly normal.

Right now, she doesn't seem to care about life too much, so i would just let her know i love her, and i would leave alone.|`|eZDoQPg8aa	It might sound cold, but I think you are making the right decision.

This just doesn't make any sense.  She cannot drown reality in a sea of alcohol.  But she must admit this to herself.  That is the first step on the road back to sobriety.  It would help if she'd seek out AA meetings in her area.  That would be the best thing to do since she will have a built-in support network.  You are under no obligation to make your sibling stop drinking.  She must do this by herself.  What you can do is to suggest these things to her and let her take it from there.  She's an adult, after all.|`|16EYP0Xiaa	I agree with you, she needs professional help. At this point there is not much you can do.|`|vs5rK3iRaa	No, you are absolutely correct, you cannot make her stop drinking.  She is beyond anyone's help at this point.  She must make the decision to stop if that's what she wants to do.  If not, then she will surely drink herself to an early grave.  Will your family blame you for that?  Perhaps, but you must not blame yourself because you are just an observer.  All the power rests in your sister's hands. Your power in is taking care of your husband and children and living your own life.  Good luck, and may God be at your side.|`|913fb8ceffd6a8e7aea30ec81720fd2eaa	I actually grew up in a similar situation.  Personally, I would not drop everything and fly out to your sister.  You as a person can only deal with so much.  You mentioned you have a full life, and don't want to be burdened, which is absolutely understandable.  It's certainly not your job to fix your sister's problems.    People make choices in life for one reason or another, and we'll never really know why they choose what they choose.  I've gotten to the point where I've realized that a) you cannot change people and b) they have to want to change to actually change.  Your sister has fallen back into old patterns, demonstrating that she no longer wants to keep her sober status.    As cold as this might sound, I sever contact with those kinds of people.  It's not worth your sanity.  More importantly though.. her life is her life, and she will do with it what she wants.  You can only support her if she explicitly asks for it.|`|NuqtamRFaa	You sound like you are making safe boundaries for yourself and your own family. She does not have the tools of AA, so it is very hard when a crisis happens. Your family may want to look into a intervention to get her into a rehap for detox and some help. It sounds as though she may just die from this disease if no one reaches out a hand. But if she is not willing of coarse, nothing can be done. I wonder if there is anyone in her area that is in recovery that could talk to her?|`|y3sXZGTWaa	I'm totally with you on this one.    If your family wants to "enable" her, let them.  Make it clear to them that unless she asks for help, there's no point in wasting your time.    I've also got many members in my family that are addicts, plus an ex-husband and I've seen all the enabling and co-dependancy for one lifetime.    Live your life and do it well!|`|AA10275485	With your plate being as full as is is, you obviously can't just leave town to be by her side. But that doesn't mean you can wash your hands completely of the situation, She still is your sister. You do have a moral responsibility. Even if you show your love and support via telephone, you need to do the right thing. .  You may regret it if you choose to completely ignore her.
E047GSKdaa	Sorry, but it is her room too.  If you want alone time, you need to find a private place.  Many of us went through the adjustments in college.  It is part of the experience, sucky room mates make us better able to appreciate adult life.  You actually have it pretty easy compared to some.  I had a lesbian room mate, which I didn't care she was a lesbian, but she brought homem a different girl every night and loved having sex in front of God and everyone (exhibitionist).  Plus she smoked pot all day long and stunk up my clothes.|`|N1qKXDs2aa	tell her you think you saw her car gettin towed, or their serving free pizza in the student union. when she leaves just "go to sleep" and lock the door! Lol|`|r9s0VyJgaa	Dropping hints about needing space and alone time is only half the message -- you also have to be honest with her and tell her that you need for her to spend some time **elsewhere** so that you can have the room to yourself for awhile.    Are your class schedules identical? Surely there are times of day when she has class and you don't?  That could be alone time for you.     See if you can sit down with her and work out an agreement where she agrees to leave the room -- maybe to study at the library? -- for certain specified hours of the day.    Its **your** room, too -- you're entitled to some time to yourself in it, just as much as she is.|`|xXWSpw5Saa	say,  umm so n s can u please get me aaaa shamppoo bottle? thankz, hen lock the door lol :-D|`|0c23df02aa982b654d80dcf290df51dbaa	It's her room too, get used to it.|`|lwG6tvOqaa	Wow i wanted to college, and have a dorm room, but now that you mention it...    Anyway, she sounds like she has self esteem issues, so i would politely ask her to leave the room, and make up some excuse, so that it will give her a reason to leave. If you tell her that you just want alone time, that might cause her not to want to leave, because for crying out loud, it's a dorm room, and youre not supposed to have alone time! That is why you are sharing it.    Anyway, if you are not the type of person who would not feel right just putting her out like that, then try to make friends with her so that you will feel more comfortable putting her out when you need to. That is what i would do, because i wouldn't want to hurt her feelings.|`|69c729bbc40865df57b81abf4bbab3caaa	It's her room as well, and technically she has every right to be there whenever she likes, but with that said you also have a right to be there whenever you like as well.  Have you tried talking to her directly about it?  It doesn't have to be a pushy or rude conversation.  "Hey, I've noticed that you spend a lot of time in the room, which I understand, but I feel like you get all the alone time in the world and I never seem to have any time here to myself.  Would it be possible to work out some kind of schedule so we can both have a little time to ourselves?".  I had 2 room mates like this in college and we were able to talk it out.  Encourage her to join clubs, mention great places on campus to eat or study, even mention greek life if your campus offers it.  Just have a frank discussion about your need for space.|`|AA10355768	why don't you try just asking her nicely if you can have the room to yourself. You can also try talking to yoru RA about it, they can also helpp.|`|c3e28d1de34738af175ecd2df41d3be5aa	I have to agree with the other person, it's her room as well so she's free to do whatever she wants.    However, perhaps you can encourage her to participate in after school activities, like join a club so she can make friends and get out more often.|`|3fdae78a1420cd1cabe15faff2f61fcaaa	well try doing something embarrassing.  i know this is gonna be hard but it should work.  put on a porn and do your thing.  if she doesn't leave right away, ask her to join you.    that or give her money and ask her to go get you some hard to find medicine because you don't feel well.  you could take up smoking.  start using the bathroom an leave the door open.  hope that helps.  or you could say hey, you might want to leave while you got a chance to. john doe is coming over an he likes to drink and grab onto anything that,s cute.

67e4501c0c56a505b86d4b14fc9a8330aa	One of the purposes of abstaining from meat on Friday is so that you become aware of what you do in life.

If you ever ate meat on the day decided by humans to be the last Wednesday in February, despite that our calendar is flawed and we have to add a day once every 4 years in compensation for our error, you'll go to hell. Get ready for it. Because it totally matters. Meat, that came from an animal, if it goes past your lips, on this day, hell.

I am considering converting to Pastafarian. this religion, you can do what ever you want (legally) eat whatever..its a pretty "do what you want" religion. <br>  <br>  i dont think a religion should tell you what to do what to eat how to do things a certain way but thats just me. if you believe, you believe, if you don't then you don't|`|mwW4zIwIaa	You're not religious, so why even try?<br>  Do what you believe in. Don't do it because everyone tells you to. Religion is not something you can force someone into.|`|CssyQVD0aa	Your headed to see the scary bad man in the red suite my friend.|`|DS4x6nnaaa	If you have time to post here and get other people's "thoughts" then maybe you could take the time to read up on why this is done.  If you do not want to be "Catholic", then don't.  Giving up meat for Friday's, during Lent is nothing!  The Vatican Part Deux did away with "every Friday no-meat days"...now that might be tougher.  Then again, HE gave HIS life for our sins...the least we Catholics can do is abide by the watered down rules to show penance and recognize his sacrifice.  Another poster said it best...this is the least of your problems...be Catholic...or be whatever you decide will get you to the promise land.<br>  <br>  ybic
4Vmlf902aa	They don't call Karma a b1+ch for nothing......|`|kLNhAEVpaa	I'm not a very strict believer in karma. What happens happens to me.|`|GPznIhzMaa	I believe in karma and I have a lot of examples. Here's one of my favorite personal examples:<br>  <br>  When I was 18, I had a huge crush on a guy I worked with. He wasn't over his ex but he led me on anyway. He agreed to go with me to my prom, cancelled on me a week before the prom, and ignored my calls. Fast-forward 5 years later. He contacts me out of the blue, asks me out, shows interest... Three months later, I get into a serious relationship with my current boyfriend. This guy still calls me even though I've told him to leave me alone. I've told him, "Hey, at least I'm being upfront with you. That's more than what you gave me before." Ha!|`|28qmqsySaa	I used to believe in that<br>  but the way I have been treated for so long and no one is getting what they give to me back at them I believe it does not work<br>  I keep my temper and thoughts to myself when I get verbally attached and hurt by others adn nothing every happens to them ever<br>  so I think it takes time off from certain people and maybe it works for others but not for sure for me<br>  <br>  good luck<br>  smile|`|EV1Z1AWCaa	Ditched my friend to take my sister to a concert. The next day I went to hang out with the guy I was seeing.  His ex girlfriend came knocking on the door.  Since he still had feelings for her and didn't want her to know about me he asked me to hide in the closet.|`|5P3cHR4Taa	I think so.|`|q5wcJZEOaa	Karma is an universal law of nature which also governs mankind, animals, ghosts, hell-beings and fairies, gods and goddessess.<br>  If U r really interested , please train in Buddhist good meditation, then U will be very happy to see the above, and joyful because the universe is so just and fair<br>  This is the only way U open Ur eyes or inner eyes to see your true self and the true faces of this modern world- full of falsehood and evils, and heading for destruction - just as the Buddha predicted 2,500 years ago.|`|0tNCtgzbaa	yes, I used to help people with no foods now I always have foods sometimes I don't have a job but there's always someone to help me with food and shelter.

That sounds like a difficult assignment to give people. It's not the time to be modest though, sell yourself man!<br>  <br>  I think you are a genuinely nice and caring person. You really picked me up out of the dumps once Daoie!<br>  It probably didn't feel like anything to you, and that's what's great about you. You are smart, silly and your questions make us smile.|`|AA12158476	From what I do know of you, you have an open and giving heart (proof being that you always ask an honest question and are not pretentious) you seem to very sensitive about those around you and even though you don't need their "approval" you would like to know their opinion. And the fact that you ALWAYS give us all (((HUGS))) no matter what shows you are not judgmental toward others. You allow us all our flaws and are still accepting. You are a good person.......but this is just my opinion.|`|po4j4xhAaa	I agree 100% with that quote.<br>  <br>  You are strong, resilient, intelligent, you will persevere through adversity, you have principles and you stick to them, you have goals and you work hard to achieve them....  that's all I can come up with before coffee....LOL<br>  <br>  Good luck honey, I hope you get it!|`|FhHklqkhaa	you know yourself better then I do<br>  on here you seem helpful, intelligent and sensitive plus caring|`|rkC443vnaa	who knows. we cant get to know you that well just by ur answers and questions.|`|SZdVYrSSaa	OK, <br>  <br>  I have only been here for a few weeks, but in that time, I have become completely addicted to your questions. If there is an option (many colleges use this, so I'm just trying) to write your own essay prompt and answer it, take that route.<br>  <br>  You write insightful and very different questions, and when you answer people or write a question, you often give an experience from your own life. If I were to give it a go at first chance, I would say that you are a caring and innovative person who is willing to share himself honestly with others to support their plight. You have become addicted to a site used explicitly to help other people, and as an out homosexual in high school, you are also obviously quite sensitive to your own feelings, and capable of standing tall in a short crowd.<br>  <br>  So I think, if I were you, and I wanted to choose a quality, a single word to describe my status in the world, I'd be writing about courage. Partly, I believe in an essay on personal courage because I think this is something a college hears little of, often due to a student's fear of boasting. Partly, I believe that it will benefit you because you are writing from the point of view of someone who has courage not only in himself, but who has the courage to be giving to others, which is a very humble perspective. And partly, because I think an essay on why you're tragically cute is not going to fly with the admissions councilors, regardless of how true ; )<br>  <br>  Just remember, the more true you are to yourself, the better. They ask this question to get to know you, these people don't want a scholarly researcher from 1827(until you get there :P). Most schools are looking for modern perspectives and diversity over your stereotypical Trans-Atlantic WASP (there are a few exceptions, email me if you are applying to Harvard, Swarthmore, or Princeton, and this will all change).<br>  <br>  Best of luck, and don't hesitate to ask me for anything, if there is one thing I will admit to being good at, it's getting in to schools.<br>  <br>  <br>  MP: This is one of my favorite quotes of his. There is a similar belief from August Strindberg. I think it is brilliantly put, though, I am trying to believe that you can at least be intelligent and content. (That's probably not possible either though).|`|QlCopFqyaa	I think you're a very outgoing guy.  Very creative with your minipolls!<br>  You seem to get along with everybody... cept those hater of trolls. :)<br>  <br>  I disagree with the quote, if you go beyond it...doesnt it take an even more intelligent person to overlook all the negatives and unhappiness and to always look for the positives?  Its way too easy just to give into it all...|`|uky2nsh8aa	all the stuff i know of you i don't think could be put into a mere essay, simply summed up as who you are. ^_^<br>  and i agree with the quote. >.<<br>  <br>  lol, i have gov. 5th. <br>  <br>  hmm.... i think resilience would work nicely if you want a trait. you're really strong, and in a somewhat unacknowledged way. <br>  *shrugs and gives you cookies*

I wasn't even allowed to get out of bed for the first 10 days.<br>  <br>  Somehow, I don't think this was quite what you meant, though.  :-D<br>  <br>  But it sure did give me a different perspective on simply "being" outdoors, when I finally did get out!  It helped that this was in late spring, so no snow, and lots of flowers growing.  So I do understand that kind-of freaky feeling you describe.|`|aHlpWFVhaa	A week or so.
oY4vwdjVaa	No. But it's sad to say that some overly religious couples might. That's what god wants. Using science to mutilate his children. Where in the bible is that? I must have missed something.|`|pYn2L2DHaa	Treatments are wonderful for treating something which is actually *wrong* -- but being left-handed, or having a second toe which is longer than one's big toe, or being gay are *differences* where nothing is actually *wrong*.    No, I would not subject a child to a treatment to make them "straight".  We need diversity within our genetic pool (including homosexuality) to survive as a species.|`|wbfw04xPaa	Any gay couple would of course have the child gay or not. If the option were to choose gay or straight on the other hand that's a different story i suppose that there would be a lot of people who would want the child to be what it would have been naturally vs. "pill to choose"    BUT im sure there are plenty of loving parents who would choose to make their child's life as easy as possible which would probably be the "normal" path (straight).    Personally I'd have the child as is with out checking its sexuality, and definitely not choosing it for him/her.|`|bRAmXcowaa	i wouldnt drug my child into mutation. I wouldnt medicate my child into a more sociably acceptable form. I wouldnt remove or change any part of my child. If i did want to do so, it wouldnt really be my child would it?|`|7b1f8172d4a9ac10c23b5f3870728bb8aa	no. i want my kids to be who they are.  there is nothing wrong with being gay anyways we dont need treatment|`|K6cHlzAkaa	I wouldnt even take a sneak-peak on his/her sexual orientation. I would accept things the way they are.|`|OsxQNDHzaa	Homosexuals do not need "treatment"!!  They are not sick!!  :@)|`|KXZj1ZPNaa	I would keep them the same. and I wouldn't change it for one bit. :)|`|ynZvIh2baa	they are what they are, i woudln't even what to know until the child got old enough. So i wouldn't find out, same with which sex it is. It would just come as it comes. That being said, I think unless the world continues to get better, i would want a straight child, because it is still difficult for homosexuals, even now adays. so i would definately rather them be straight, because it will be easier on them. either way i would love them anyway and support them.|`|IUlIixJLaa	I wouldn't mess with that childs life in any way...Let him/her grow up and make their own decisions, if they are gay so be it, we all have freedom of choice|`|HH90Eghaaa	No way!  I don't believe in genocide or whatever this would be called! Its still the same thing!|`|8ae38a2ac6a77dd4a25ba0e15d91e256aa	i would want a healthy, well adjusted, happy child. i wouldn't give it's sexuality much (if any at all) thought.|`|GJFBsG62aa	I would refuse to know what sexuality my child is, they are my child and thats all that matters.
OpkBvRIaaa	More importantly why is this justified in this section. That's like me asking about batteries in the bullfighting section.    Also does anyone know if there is still a bullfighting section, that was ridiculous.|`|MK5Ddtiiaa	Culture.|`|r9s0VyJgaa	The younger ones wear them too.      They don't wear belts so if they need something to keep their pants up, they wear suspenders.|`|LOSfacl5aa	They believe in having simple clothes, no belt loops in the pants so they use suspenders. Young men wear them too|`|0fdcff8e3af9032c593e6e389f890730aa	Well, the reason for that is mainly for tradition and to keep themselves separate from the world.      However, lots of these older men used to belong to groups that would require suspenders.  These groups would dissolve but they would keep the tradition.

I've been naked on the clothing optional beach many times, surrounded by hundreds of other naked people, so nudity isn't a problem.

Screw the stereotypes.
GqfiRXu3aa	You are correct -- when someone says, "Hi, how are you?" it is a greeting, NOT a question.  So simply saying, "Find, thanks, how are you?" is fine.  If the person has time to say, "Not bad," that's fine -- but if the person doesn't have time, it really isn't a matter of being rude, it's a matter of time, or lack thereof.|`|AA11185479	You're overthinking this.  Just answer whatever seems natural to you.  Anyone that would take offense at this isn't the sort of person you want to talk with anyway.  "I'm good, and you?" and "Fine, thanks" are both perfectly acceptable responses given this in-transit situation.|`|vs5rK3iRaa	Just skip trying to answer the question, because it's probably not really a question but a greeting.  Instead just reply, " Hey, good morning (afternoon, evening)" or even "Hi , nice to see you".|`|jWBikTSjaa	Like you said - it's just a casual greeting.  One step beyond "Hi." I do it all the time...  "Hey!  How's it going? "  Keep walking.  But thinking about it, I guess I usually say it enough in advance when approaching them, that they have time to get out the obligatory, "Good.  You?" reply.    I wouldn't stress over it.  Imagine if you stopped someone and got into a long conversation about your knee injury or the stomach ache you had yesterday.  Let's face it - they probably don't want to know.|`|xcxtNao0aa	Simply say fine thanks and u? That would be polite,but don't expect much in return cause manners r not taught like back in the old days.U can't expect something from ppl that they don't understand, and u do know better!Besides I find getting out of the habbit really sucks when ur in a place where it's common to know the niceties and u forget and come out looking like a hillbilly!|`|YLezctqpaa	That bothers me x_x  But If the person I'm talking to  gets into a good conversation,   Then I wouldnt bother at all!|`|wuDcLEzKaa	just say "Im fine how are you" in a more enthusiastic way than they said it to you!|`|el8yX5q3aa	Just say fine thanks..and go on.  They aren't waiting for a conversation...|`|xXWSpw5Saa	say, hello i am fine so n so|`|gFRtc52Baa	say im doing good and your self ?|`|JtMoUpJIaa	you should answer fine and u? because if u doesn't u may sound "self-absorbed" as u said and if the don't answer just try to make conversation but don't wait to long|`|272b4b9f1dbb02370331a991e15d7432aa	When they smile they are just trying to say that they are good as well.  They're not trying to be rude.|`|gfhN4CXBaa	I always say "Fine and you?"  If they don't answer i just smile and keep on going.|`|Tf0WM1WMaa	yell and run the opposite direction|`|4htIOhx6aa	I always say "I'm fine, thanks, and you"?  It just seems more polite to me to ask it back, but if they don't answer, don't worry about it, they might just not have heard you.|`|mr5qcM3Laa	Just be over the top and hyper that's what I do. say like "HI I'M GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!! AND HOW ARE YOU!!!!!" Really hyperly|`|874e9ed8d38f4753f6cca93e708cd95baa	It depends on the person you are talking to.  Some of them really do answer you, others only ask the "how are you" part because they are on autopilot.  That sounds like what you're experiencing.  As long as you acknowledge them, it's not important that they acutally tell you how they are.  I think the 'how are you' response you think might be weird might actually be the best way for you to go in this case.  It means you are acknowledging their greeting.  There's one woman I've worked with for years, and every time I see her the first time in the day, I'll ask her how she is, and she'll say "Just fine, and yourself?" but doesn't hang around long enough to hear the answer.  BTW, she'll answer "just fine" even when she has the flu...|`|lwG6tvOqaa	If this happens in the hallway, then they are just trying to let you know that they  acknowledge you, so that you won't feel like you are being dissed. That is not the place to be starting a convo because of all the people, but some people do it anyway.    If they just walk up to you and say that, then they are trying to talk to you, and you should respond back.

A 'looker' that is impossible to get along with has no place in my life.<br>  Common interests mean we have things to do together; also very important.<br>  Physical appearance does matter some.  It's true.  Attention to looks says something about how she values herself.<br>  <br>  Two other big items for me are: <br>  generosity - a desire to give back<br>  mindfulness - learning and growing; being awake and aware of more than just what's happening day to day|`|mUSzHFeWaa	I'm not going to say that looks don't matter at all, but that's a distant second to personality. Soooooo much of what makes a girl attractive is her personality, sense of humor, self confidence, etc.|`|CdJtH0xdaa	Personality and interests|`|wMunBQ9Oaa	Body, personality, and down to Earthness.

Yay for perpetual charcoal!|`|FhHklqkhaa	nota ll are bad - it's just christianity/catholics that use fear to achieve their aims|`|YyEEAJBkaa	Because of your lack of knowledge of them.|`|89MKzLl3aa	It's only in the head of those who think that way, such as yourself.|`|6lJuKKMHaa	That would be your 'fake religions' you are referring to.
H41u0B8Jaa	I do!  Up until grade 7 girls had to wear skirts or dresses.  I remember walking to school in the winter and wearing pants under my dress to keep warm but having to take them off when I got to school.  Seems so strange to think of that now.|`|rJJhMQ37aa	Yes!  We lived almost 2 miles from the school, and I had to walk to school.  No car.  This was in Michigan, and it was sometimes way below zero outside.Very, very cold.<br>  <br>  Our school board would NOT allow girls to wear pants, not even just to walk to and from school.  No way could a girl go into the bathroom and take off pants she'd worn under her dress.  No pants. No way.  No how!<br>  <br>  Mama went to the principal many, many times on my behalf.  She went to the school board several times.  She tried to get other mothers to agree and protest with her.  No one wanted to stir up trouble.<br>  <br>  And so, Mama bought me these long, heavy, brown stockings that went all the way up.  She pinned them to my underwear.  I was the only little girl in school in these ugly stockings.  How I hated them!  Everyone else had dainty little socks.  Terrible thing to do to a sensitive child.|`|KWwW7N49aa	Yes.  We got to wear jeans (pressed and clean) when I was in my senior year of high school in the late 1960s. What a thrill!  No cut offs or hot pants allowed like that allow today. We would not have worn those anyway as we were taught to be lady-like.|`|IWyrJ7o3aa	We were never allowed to wear pants to school, when I was in grade school we were allowed to wear pants under our dress when it was real cold out.|`|Dmaahsc3aa	I never could until I got to college. . . Catholic school for the first 12 and all I wore were uniforms !   = (|`|mQZDizMVaa	Absolutely-unless it snowed. Wore them under your skirt, then took them off in school.<br>  <br>  I remember having to wear white blouses, dark skirt for Assemblies. As someone stated before, teachers dressed professionally-men: shirt/tie/jackets, women; dresses. <br>  <br>  Jeans (aka "dungarees") were worn weekends or after school.<br>  <br>  Even had gym uniforms: short jumpsuits. Still have it.|`|28eea98fddd54ae673d51f8522541419aa	The year after I graduated was the first year pants were allowed for girls at my high school.  And in the sixties socks of any kind were not fashionable so we wore panty hose. Now that was annoying.  We were also required to wear our skirts a certain length--- when you kneel on the floor the skirt must touch the floor. They would actually make you kneel!   They thought they were making us dress as ladies but no lady could walk up and down all those stairs carrying a pile of books and not flash someone .|`|71VRvldJaa	Absolutely!  I was in highschool in the 60's and pants were not allowed!  When I graduated and started my first full time office job, they weren't allowed in the office either!  Female teachers only wore skirts or dresses and male teachers wore suits!|`|rxScdXM4aa	yeah i went to one of those schools. i'm 23 now and i wore pants for the longest but i'm getting back to dresses and skirts|`|7xGtL1vxaa	Yes, I was in the 9th grade before we could wear a Pant suit. It had to meet the guidelines, later that year we could wear Pant dresses and they were really strict about those.|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	yes.  our skirts were measured when we got there to make sure they weren't to short.<br>  boys could not wear sandals unless they wore socks.  and no necklaces on boys in his school.<br>  then we moved to california with no dress code.|`|4uike3ARaa	Not just the girls not wearing pants.<br>  We (guys) could not wear jeans or t-shirts. Slacks and a collared shirt were required.<br>  And that wasn't even the Jesuit school I later went to!|`|80lWqRFiaa	Yep and we wore pants underneath until we got there, and then put them on for the return trip when it was cold.|`|IS7Xubkfaa	I remember they couldn't wear pants in class, but girls could wear pants at recess and other activities. All teachers dressed professionally. <br>  <br>  Woman dressed smartly and all men wore suit and tie. Only the custodian wore regular clothes or a uniform. The cafeteria woman all wore white uniforms and always had head nets in place.|`|5d93feba60a6599e3f77941fe4be59d6aa	Yes I do. I also remember when I was in high school, a bunch of us girls decided we were going to all wear pants to school one day. That way maybe we wouldn't get in trouble if we all wore pants. Most of us wore pants that day but the other girls brought skirts with them to school and they decided to change into their skirts at the last minute chickening out! One of the girls didn't bring a skirt, so she was the only girl in pants in the whole school all day. Yep! It was me! No one said anything to me about it! Not one word! The very next year they changed the dress code so we could wear pants. Not because of me. They changed it all over!|`|aEeCCHVlaa	Back in my school days (after horse and buggy days), we did not have a formal dress code at my school, but rather one of wanting to look presentable.  Girls wore skirts, sweaters, blouses and dresses - no jeans, cut-offs, or shorts (except for PE), and bobby socks. Boys wore jeans/dress slacks, shirts w/buttons, no tee shirts, shorts (except for PE), always wore white socks and definitely no hats/caps.  All wore clothes that fit them, not 3 sizes too large or 2 sizes too small.  Exposing the midriff was a no-no.  There was no mini attire at the time, so that was not a problem.  And we carried our books, no matter how many - no book bags/ knapsacks.  Except for the students who had part time jobs, no students were allowed to have vehicles on school grounds - either walked or rode the school bus.|`|AA12185428	Yes. Sure do. I remember one evening, in grade school, we had an art display at school and my Mother put me in pants to go. I was so worried about standing there with pants on and it felt so weird. Even upon graduation going into the workforce, I had trouble wearing pants. It was nice to see my Mother go from house dresses to pants too. Funny, she still kept a slip on and tucked it in her pants(she was thin and it was hardly noticeable).|`|AAgX0SDcaa	Yes, we had a protest and wore pants to school one day during 8th grade.  We figured if we could get a majority of girls to wear them one day, the principal would not send us home, because the school loses money for each student who is not there. Short, short dresses and skirts were in style then, not modest and when the wind blew in the winter they were miserable. I wasn't about to wear pants under my dresses like they allowed us to do in Missouri, at least on the playground at recess.  I was wearing my jeans and the basketball coach walked by and remarked  "Girls should wear dresses, they will be more behaved than when they are wearing pants."    I looked at him and replied "well maybe you should make the boys wear them then, they are the ones that are always acting up at school."  Nobody got sent home, good thing because I lived about 10 miles out in the country. Our student council took a vote, even the most of the boys voted to allow girls to wear them, and gave the recommendation to the office. They changed the rule that week and said it was OK as long as we didn't wear ragged jeans.  I still wore dresses and skirts sometimes, made some scooter skirts and a maxi dress, but jeans were my favorite.|`|1VaH8D3Raa	And you would never see a bra commercial on TV<br>  .<br>  And when you would never see a married couple sleeping in the same bed lest see them almost totally naked as you see common place today<br>  ;<br>  And the seen commercials of a male sex problem and some guy<br>  By the name of <br>  Smilen Bob in a swimming pool with his shorts kind of on the bottom of the pool<br>  And all the people there in amazement as Bob smiles and waves<br>  .|`|BC3oQiIhaa	I sure do remember that - freezing my skinny legs off!  I, too, went to Catholic schools for all 12 years and wore uniforms.  We wore pants under our skirts in grade school until we got there.  Once in high school though, we wore our skirts as short as possible without the nuns coming down on us.|`|vOYyFqxRaa	It was not until my senior year in High School that we got the right to wear pants suits to school. I live in the frozen North and had to walk to school.|`|zXDVn4BQaa	Yes and we couldn't have long bangs either.  Boys had rules too.  No blue jeans, dark colored slacks only. One day a boy came to school wearing beige pants and was sent home to change.|`|8000008da995a7f2941cb90d17250013aa	Well, around here, pants are what you wear under your trousers....lol...<br>  <br>  So I first thought you were asking when girls were forced to go "commando"...|`|59Wg2cI3aa	nope, as a matter of fact girls worn slacks under skirts in the winter time|`|hallarIxaa	yes way back in my youth.|`|FcZU29W6aa	I do!!!  It was awful in the winter -- had to wear a dress or skirt and freeze to death walking to school.  Girls could wear leggings (sort of like a pair of pants made out of coat material).  Of course, we chose to freeze rather than wear pants that made you look like you had gained 20 pounds!!!  And, I lived in Massachusetts at the time.  Burrrr. . . . .<br>  <br>  I do remember mini skirts becoming popular when I was in 10th grade.  There was a discussion of how short they could be and one of the teachers suggested 6" above the knee.  And the Principal blurted out "Some girls don't have 6" above the knee!!!"  I was in the student council and that was why I was present at that meeting.  I still remember all the laughter and that was many, many years ago.

Have fun!|`|TKMuD3TPaa	First of all, quince means "fifteen". Get your facts straight. Secondly, a masquerade party is just plain lame.|`|lwG6tvOqaa	That sound like fun even though i am not Latina. Just make sure that you have great music, food and entertainment for your guests to enjoy.|`|ZjpVlm9Gaa	Yea do it!!! I'd have fun at least. And no its not lame at all.
qWu5F1O2aa	In any latin american country, native american (regional indigenous ppl) will face discrimination by a large number of the population. This is bc the "developed" society considers them low class, uneducated, dirty due to lack of "proper" hygiene and not advanced socially and physcally (im sorry, i dont like saying stuff like this but it falls true to other individuals' thoughts). A name they're usually called is 'indio' or 'india'. Though this means indian, it is said in a derrogatory way to emphasize low class bc of their ancestry. Aside from being unable to find stable and good paying jobs bc of "lack of education", they also face racism everyday, even by their own people who have seemed to have prospered in the "outside" society. I saw it a lot in Argentina with the Guarani and Aymara indians. While some individuals may insist they're not racist towards them, they are "indirectly" and some are open about it. Sad but true. I love Argentina and Latin America but this is one thing they could change|`|tEIGR2vFaa	The white Guatemalans? You might think it's racist to say that, but look at Mexico and see how the Native Americans have been marginalized by European Mexicans throughout the nation's history and today. It's a definite possibility....
bMgjyKceaa	Without context, it can be a bit tricky, but I'll try guessing what you are trying to get at below.<br>  <br>  Love is hate - Liebe ist Hass.  The word Hassliebe means love-hate, like a relationship.<br>  <br>  Till we die - "Bis Tod" would mean until death.  Bis wir sterben literally means until we die.<br>  <br>  Killing death - "Tod abt?ten" would be killing death, but that one requires heavy context.|`|njrKjJVwaa	Love is hate  - Liebe ist Hass<br>  Till we die - bis wir sterben<br>  killing death - t?tender (vernichtender) Tod|`|uEZwoUGCaa	Liebe ist Hass=Love is hate<br>  Bis wir sterben=Till we die<br>  m?rderischer/vernichtender/t?tender Tot=Killing death
EmOnt7FIaa	Well, because believe it or not the U.S. economy will suffer greatly, especially the Southwestern States. Even though Mexico may be  considered a "poor country" by American standards, it is still a major trading partner of the United States and cross border commerce is very important to the U.S. economy.|`|StRaKUf6aa	You wouldn't know what to do with your American self if that happened.|`|eIwj9a3yaa	the border is closed, they cross anyways|`|tlUihEOvaa	It's called business, that's why.|`|qmpoGK5Gaa	don't worry cuz usa sucks and someday you'll be crossing the border to work in mx. hahahaha
0lnamekJaa	If he is or if he isn't... It is up to HIM to come out...     Don't make comments about how you will still love him even if he is gay...    Don't treat him any differently at all...    He is your brother and who he takes to bed is no business of your or anyone else but him...    Wouldn't you be upset if he started to get all in to who you take to bed?    I figured out that I was in to girls when I was 9 or 10... But I didn't come to terms with it until much later... in my 20's...    Just treat him like a human and he will come out on his own terms.|`|Kz2n6P1Vaa	To be honest I think his gay|`|KDst9z5Naa	I think he has gay tendencies and looks gay .|`|e158WyFGaa	Yes..i think he is gay.|`|NQ3eETlYaa	He could be. Sounds like me (with the dancing and the sitting, lol) and I'm bi. So maybe he's bi or something.    BTW, he's pretty hot. :P  You can tell him I said that. ;)|`|LN9FXnKPaa	who cares if hes gay or not. stop trying to turn him gay. if hes gay then let him be gay.|`|SqWJCZyeaa	He may be gay. He sort of looks gay... if he complains about all the boys loving sports and talking about sports, he probably is.|`|zkovxRseaa	i'm happy to say that i am convinced YOU are the gay one|`|77d8d8cd21849a9ea42ffd10b55a0c29aa	awww he's cute...but there's a difference in gay and feminine|`|aPcw0sz7aa	no offense but he does kind of look gay but like you said, he is only 12. you never know, it doesnt matter anyway, hes going to be your brother no matter what right??|`|AzZZuxdRaa	dang..he's pretty cute..it wud b a shame if he waz gay.. have u asked him about it? if he keeps bringing it up to test ur reaction, then maybe he wants to c wat u'll say wen he does actuall tell you. I cant giv u a definite answer, cuz he jus myte b feminine, but u shud ask him 2 b sure.|`|fbBNdmF1aa	well first of all  AWWWW HES ADORABLE!!! XD  but he may be, you never know.  he may just be figuring it out and or questioning and finding himself out.  and hes still young, so i wouldn't expect him to come out any time too soon.  maybe within a couple years he'll figure himself out  just be there for him and let him know you support him  :)|`|rDsKB0uXaa	I don't think so hes young so the dancing makes sense|`|RXS9K18Faa	idk but i love So you think you can dance. its a great show. but i wish katie won instead of justin :P. she so deserved it more lol anyway    idk he might just be experimenting a bit trying things out.|`|4N7uERy1aa	how iz he 12 and already in high school?|`|YNKyEk4faa	Why dont you talk about it with him?  Awww hes really cute lol.....  but i would just talk to him and not just throw it on him real fast...  good luck!|`|3PEQAUT9aa	He does a little.    But some guys act very feminine and still are straight.|`|jTVbjyghaa	Oh yeah. He's gay.|`|BILIAKSOaa	He looks a little gay by the way he is smiling. There is nothing wrong with being gay though. Your parents and you should completely support him. If he is gay, he can't change it. It's like you don't get to pick the hair color you are born with. It just happens. Defiantly support him if he is because he is young and it could effect him at this age if you don't. There is a chance he might not be gay. I mean he is a guy, but young so he could just be learning about things. Not sure what's happening.   Hopefully I helped. (:|`|4f9vyUEoaa	He sounds gay, but he could be feminine and don't assume he is wait till he come out.|`|AAZTO16baa	ya i think he is|`|c3e28d1de34738af175ecd2df41d3be5aa	It is possible that he may be gay, but it appears that you are simply stereotyping him. If he's only 12 then let him figure out what sexual orientation he has and when he figures it out he'll let you know he's gay.|`|pKr77Vqiaa	I really just dont no (Beats me) He looks pretty normal I guess, but he has a few gay traits.|`|rxQ4wtnkaa	Yeah he is i seen the pic he is smiling very weird and holding his hands kinda gay so yea and he is trying to hide it from his dad and also he shouldn't be gay for dancing Feminine but i dance to lady gaga and i'm not gay|`|AyEkA6Flaa	It's true that sometimes even straight boys act a bit girly.    But his reaction to your dad's arrival...and his dropping the words "gay" and "lesbian" in conversation...suggest to me that he thinks he is gay and wants to know if it's safe for him to come out to you.    You need to do some gay-friendly talking so he knows it's okay.    Hmm, he's a very cute boy!  Did you tell him to hold his hands like that?  If not, my gaydar is definitely pinging, my dear.    I'd say there is a good chance he is gay.  And he seems very nice.  Support and encourage him, definitely.|`|bvt9kvS8aa	Maybe his gay, maybe his not..  you should love him regardless.|`|89SJCvclaa	We have a winner!!!!  :)|`|30de87c5ec5765c6c07c6e06550ecd5daa	well he does a little bit I mean I'd go out with him and im guessing by you asking this question you are either in the closet or half way and so what if he is it just means you will have other things to talk about BTW your brother is hot|`|PvJdZcZTaa	Based on my own personal experience, he's gay. When I was younger I was relatively the same way. I was pretty masculine as a kid but even so I would freak and try to act as manly as possible whenever my father came around. I was terrified of my father disowning, which he did later but that's another story. Lol.     He probably needs some support, I would have LOVED to have had someone in my family to support me or to at least be able to tell my secret it. It's quite a load when you know you're gay as a kid. Constantly thinking you might not have a family if they find out that your "different".     So my suggestion to you is to confront him about it so you can help him. Take him somewhere private and ask him to tell him the truth and that he can trust you with your life. And of course don't lie to him when you tell him that. If he trusts you with that kind of information you could be betraying him completely if you told your parents. You don't want to risk that.    90% sure he's gay by the way.

(UGLY ON THE INSIDE AND THE OUTSIDE)|`|iWaU76T5aa	Ok so you want us to say Hispanic girls in order to apply for best answer?    That is rather an egregious approach to asking a question.    Anyways, I will say White girls since     1. Hispanic girls (the real pretty ones) throw  A LOT of tempers and are extremely conceited    2. Most Hispanic girls in the US like it or not are hoodrats who will get violent in a matter of seconds if they do not get what they want.        I love Black girls a lot and I am Half Black. I usually prefer light skin (Yellowish Skin color) for them though, mix being my favorite. I have met some GREAT Black women who would make good role models fo our society. Also, why not include Asian girls in there?|`|yS9a9jk5aa	This is based on taste. But why us black women got to be in it? lol      I say all since no pure race exist and by picking on over the other were really putting part of us down.    I am a black women and found out I have white, black (duh) Spain, and Iran in my dna..............am done with this I will never put down another race no matter how hateful they are.  We have one life, one body.....enjoy it when you still can.

Ow6lKFXiaa	The Catholic churches' activities during the war and since towards Jews is deplorable.  They still have Jewish artifacts and personal belongings obtained during the war that they refuse to return to the Jewish people.  For instance, the oldest known Torah, is being kept by the Vatican.  They claim to have the right to it because Jesus may have used one in his studies as a child.  This is the most sacred text in Judaism, but the Church claims priority because Jesus "may" have used one like it?  Preposterous!  Yet they get away with it.<br>  <br>  I find it very disturbing that the current Pope served in the Hitler Youth.  But I also understand that youth is impressionable and easy to manipulate. And most young men had no choice, they were conscripted into the Hitler movement whether they wanted to be or not.  In fairness, he has done several things to apologize to the Jewish people for what happened and is trying to change the way the world views them at the expense of dissension among his own. <br>  <br>  People change. As we mature and experience life, our views and beliefs change.  We've all made mistakes in our younger days that we now know were wrong and we regret them and wish they never happened.  I think he is honestly regretful of his naive, and most likely unwilling, participation in such horror and I appreciate his courage to admit this and I more so appreciate his courage and attempts to change things despite the oposition against him.  We are lucky to finally get someone of such compassion willing to admit the flaws of the Church.  I only wish he'd consider returning the Torah to its rightful place.  Now that would be a gesture of good faith!<br>  <br>  We must NEVER forget.  It is imperitive to keep alive the memories of those who perished, not just the Jews, but all the 12 million who suffered and died under Hitler.|`|cdc288ac537ecf1efe5ace9f795fe44aaa	The Pope did not like the Nazi Jugend meetings and did not attend many sessions. He also ran away from Camp duty as he felt what he was doing was wrong. and God was with him. he could not also run away as his parents and Brother Georg and Marie Ratzingers were waiting for him<br>  He also said it was God's will for him to live because No actionw as taken when a Nazi Officer came to their family house to recuperate and ask his Father if he was eligible for conscription and He said Yes. No further action was taken. It was this moment that Pope benedictrXVI(formerly Cardinal Josep Ratzinger) that the grace of God and the Blessed Mother that protected him<br>   He was small then and also did not see teh Nazi attrocities. It was later as a priest who realise the murder of the Jewish people was a grave mistake and that they were killing endlessly the People of the Covenant that God that God established<br>  He even cried out when he was at Auschitz that he sometimes wonder why would God allow such a horrible thing to be done against humanity<br>  He even cried To show much  he loved the Jewish race  who are people of God|`|AA11212224	It WAS compulsory.  He, along with several million other youths, were forced to join.  But he was only in it for two years (1941-1943).  After that, he was drafted into the military, but wasn't able to serve because he was too ill.  He completely deserted in 1945.<br>  <br>  Even if he had joined willingly, I wouldn't hold it against him.  Everyone makes mistakes.  Why should the Pope be any different?|`|IogJBs2Naa	I think it's scary that someone who particpated in such a hate group can be one of the most influential and powerful religious leader in the world.  But on the other hand Catholics, at least in my experience, have been more open and less judgmental toward Judaism.  <br>  <br>  Yeah I knew I would get thumbs down on this.  I guess when you aren't part of one of the groups the Nazi's persecuted it wouldn't bother y ou.|`|FkwU07iDaa	Well i think he's a bit old for a youth movement of any kind.  and are you absolutely sure that there still is a Hitler Youth Movement?<br>  <br>  Apart from that i think the Pope should be allowed to serve wherever he likes - behind the counter in Starbucks, at my local diner, in a shoe shop ... Absolutely wherever.|`|Ne9rXERpaa	Completely ambivalent -- membership was compulsory for boys his age in Nazi Germany, so we have no way of knowing whether he would have joined voluntarily.|`|AA10034051	At that time all German male youths were FORCED to join Hitlers Youth camps, they had no choice in the matter.

He had no choice, he HAD to join Hitler youth, whether he was left wing, right wing or whatever, it was compulsory!   The main thing to look at is that Hitler was not part of his beliefs.  His beliefs are what he deliviring to the Catholic Faith just now.|`|jN5SXl5Caa	No, and he just kinda looks evil. At least my boy Pope John Paul look nice and was.

AA10952386	I have friends on there that used to hang out with on a regular basis and talk to on the phone all the time - and after a few correspondences with them on FB, they stopped communicating with me. <br>  I think the idea is how many friends you have. It's really just about collecting people if you don't actually talk to them on the phone or get together with them - they're called FRIENDS for a reason.<br>  Also, there is the "friend finder" on FB, which people just put out there to initiate a friend request. Too many people have no intention of keeping in touch with those on their FB page. Older people do it, too - perhaps because their lives are so busy...the few moments they're online, they see your little picture and that's it? <br>  Some people just add a bunch of people and don't intend on sending messages or apps...I don't see the point of it, that's why I've been on  there for 3 months and only have 25 friends...I choose them wisely.|`|js2TUHFdaa	That's why you make them talk to you.<br>  <br>  <br>  XOXO|`|yuBuNoPDaa	Solution - Defriend them.

RNyEQUQDaa	Sad 2 say, most of what Catholics (Cc) practice isnt Biblical so the Cc isnt Christian. Ur partly right about the Roman's motives but it doesnt mean Jesus isnt God's Son. I almost became Catholic & found it no better than Protestant churches I grew up in.    The Bible severely warns us not 2 trust humans, not even ourselves, clergy/churches (Jer 10:2-5,23; Is 2:22; Job 12:11; Prov 14:12; Acts 17:11). So carefully think over what I say. Dont just believe or dismiss what I write. It might save u from making the same mistake many made, getting caught up in religious beliefs that hv nothing 2 do with knowing God (poisoned tree & its fruit).    Rituals hv no meaning under the NT Covenant. The Hebrew rituals were by instruction of God the best 1 could do under God's Law (None in NT). Other religions (even many Christian) either copied or invented rituals (the best humans could do within the limits of being human). Jesus' perfect sacrifice canceled the need 4 any rituals (doing them calls God a liar as it makes it appear Jesus failed His mission). The closest thing 2 a ritual is Communion but it shouldnt b treated as a ritual as its 2 b treated most seriously (Its not 2 b presented as Jesus' actual body & blood - Catholic [Cc] belief).    Many dont know the difference btwn a ritual done as a ritual & genuine "rememberance" - not possible without following Jesus' actual Biblical instructions - absent in Cc teachings (the Cc didnt write any part of the NT [not a Cc text or their writings - NT was written in the 1rst century by Apostles {NT Gospels/letters preserved the truth 4 all people not the Cc}, full Cc possession was not until 3rd century] which contradicts their teachings/practices & God's will, 1 in truth & Spirit not rituals - **God allowed them 2 produce the Bible dispite their wrong teachings like He allowed the Romans 2 fulfill prophecy without their knowledge [happening again today).** A teaching can hv a truth in whats written but the action taken can b superficial - The Cc/others, like the Pharisees, know how 2 clean the outside of the cup but dont understand how the inside is 2 be cleaned with respect 2 Jesus' actual message. The fact that the Cc & other religions retain an altar @ the center of their religious pracrtices is 1 sure sign of their being about religious rituals not the truth.    The problem is theres many religions & different varieties. 1 day I realized they cant all be right (i.e. theres 1 Bible, why so many interpretations? - II Pet 1:**19-21). Most religions came thru people who thought up things for a God they & others liked. Some realized religion could be good 2 control the masses & 4 other agendas. However, religion cant teach u much about God (they cant teach what they dont know). Who knows more about a house the Builder or he who moves in later?    For Christians, the trouble began when the Apostles/disciples were killed off or died during the 1rst century (Christianity was illegal for most of that time). Over the next century others, whom either didnt know Jesus or were less informed than Jesus' 1rst generation of believers &/or (un)intentionally added in their own ideas/agendas, replaced the original believers. By the time the Catholic religion became a "state - Jn 18:36" recognized, organized religion around the time of Constantine (about AD 325), most of what Jesus taught & original Apostles practiced were no longer present.    The Cc mixed in things of Pagan & religions practices 2 please & draw in people, thus, creating a new religion they decided 2 label "Christian/Catholic". The Cc's, like other religions' agendas (some mayve been well-intentioned), was mostly 2 control masses & 2 influence politics (II Tim 2:*4; I Jn 2:*15-17; Col 2:*8; Jer 10:*2-5). The Cc claims they didnt distribute Bibles 4 over a century b/c people couldnt read so why didnt they just teach people 2 read?    God & Jesus have never been about pleasing man. In fact, the Cc RCc & Oc had made religions just like the Pharisees, which Jesus emphatically stated was an abomination b/c they were about pleasing man not God (Mt 23:15; LK 16:15). Even when others like the Protestants split off from the Cc they retained the same wrong Cc format structure.    Even though these churches got rid of some of the Cc nonsense they still didnt know much about Jesus (most ignored or skipped over Biblical instructions due 2 various agendas) nor did they go 2 the Bible 2 find out all of Jesus' instructions [a huge mistake, as they're fulfilling prophecies against the core of their practices (Amos 8:*11; Jr 12:*10: Is 5:*9 (large houses r churches - Mt 24:*1-2); Hos 4:*6: Mk 7:1-23 (John 3:*3,5 & Ez 36:24-27,*26); Lk 16:**15 (see Rv 21:27; Jr 10:**2-5; Is 1:*11-15)].    2 Major Cc lies:    1. The CC claims 2 b the 1rst church & since they r the longest existing church, they r the only "official" church. Jesus' Apostles never named their church catholic (not in the Bible nor in line with God's message that never changes) nor did they ever practice Cc religious rituals. There was nearly a 250 yr gap btwn Jesus' original Apostle's church & the start of the official Cc - there4, the Cc was never a part of or the true 1rst Christian Church (Neither a label, title, name, its history, no. of members, amount of time it existed or claims made about them means anything (u can name anything anything). Its whats practiced that makes them either the whole truth or a lie. A dictionary definition doesnt necessarily encompass God's full definition or usage of a word (or His exceptions thereof). I.e. neither Jesus nor the Biblical prophets were ever muslims no matter what Islam's definition application 4 the word muslim is & the Cc's claim of veneration of saints/Mary is a form of idolitry no matter what they claim (calling a dog god doesnt make it God).    2. Peter was never a pope nor was he or other Apostles ever a member of the |`|QLDMmp6Taa	No.  Read Church History.  Don't just take some conspiracy nut's word for it.    Careful now.  Next thing you know you'll be wearing a tin foil hat, because you'll think the Pope can read your mind.|`|eAMq1iBWaa	Basically yes. The Roman Empire grew so huge that it was unmanageable. Constantine stepped in and decided to use relgion in conjunction with the military to unite the empire.    Bad move. Christianity never makes such church-state alliances.|`|29X6EEsKaa	All hail the flying spaghetti monster, and may they be touched by His Noodly Appendage.|`|4sUek7ugaa	Well, the history is a bit messed up but there's some truth to that.    Christianity and paganism were blended long before Rome got in on the act.  It was Paul that combined pagan mysticism with the teachings of Jesus to invent a new religion.  It had nothing to do with the Roman gods.    After a few centuries, the proto-orthodoxy had taken over and eliminated most of the other forms of Christianity.  That group taught obedience to authority, so it was quite attractive to Constantine, who wanted to blend church and state as a way of consolidating power.|`|AA11622701	Considering that for the first three centuries of its existence, the church was persecuted and its members executed by that same state, that hardly seems like it was created to marry them.    What the church did was to step in following the collapse of the Roman empire, and preserve what was left of western civilization, acting for a time as both church and state.      Hopefully your friend realized that we have still existing today over 2,000 copies of the New Testament books that date back to before the time of the "Catholic church", and the Nicean fathers that are word for word identical to the text used today.  Some dating with 30 years or less of the originals.  So if Christian "evolved" from pagan religions, it did it in less than 20 years.    In the early 50s AD (less than 50 years after the time of Christ) the Jewish exiled nearly one million Jews from the Jerusalem area because of their Christian, most of whom relocated in Egypt and began the Coptic Church.  Here are thousands and thousands of people who were alive when Jesus taught, walked and did his miracles.  They would have know first hand whether he did the things in the gospels or not.  They were there when it happened.  Yet the preserve the same stories of miracles, the resurrection, etc as the Catholic church, of which they have never been a part.      Sorry, the history simple does not support the evolution of Jesus myth.      As far why they are so many Bibles, it is because so few people read ancient Hebrew and Koine Greek, but dead languages, so it has to be translated in the languages that are used each generation.  And then retranslated a couple generations as those languages changes.  Ever tried to read the King James as it was original printer in 1611 instead of the 18th century revision used today?    Some time actually do something radical, like compare four or five of the major translations (not the paraphrases), and you will see the differences are not ones of meaning or doctrine,. but of style and technique.|`|yQNit56Qaa	1) Did the romans invent the catholic church to marry church and state so that they could control people better?    Clearly not.  The church that was first approved by emperor Constantine was the same that was persecuted by previous emperors.  I'm not sure when you consider the Roman Catholic Church to have begun, but clearly - no matter what moment you believe that it began - it was not the invention of the Romans.      2) He said that the christians and catholics spread the bible everywhere    Sort of like the way that chevys and automobiles are driven everywhere, right?      3) so that more people will fall into the trap of believing in this Jesus character.    Well, it is certainly true that this is the reason why bibles are given away.  It's the kind of trap we Christians like to be stuck in, though.      4) He said they connected the government and the church together and renamed all the roman gods and called them saints...    Nope.  You won't find any Roman Catholic saint hurling thunderbolts, inventing the lyre, riding a chariot that moves the sun across the sky, bringing spring with them every year when they return from Hades, etc. etc.  Your friend is not very well-educated in Greco/Roman mythology OR in Christianity.      5) so they blended christianity with paganism to control more people than ever before.     That's one way of looking at it.  You can also look at it in the following way:  "They adopted inoffensive (to Christians) pagan practices into Christian worship so that pagans would feel comfortable worshiping the only true God.  By this means, they saved the souls of thousands that would otherwise rejected the saving power of the gospel."      6) Then I said the only reason why there are so many bibles is because they keep making crap loads of them cuz christians are supposed to spread the word...    Well, you have a slightly mistaken idea about what "the word" is, exactly.  The gospel - which is what those called to preach are instructed by Scripture to preach - is not the bible, but only a very, very small portion of the bible.  It is true, though, that many organizations believe that distributing the bible will result in more Christians.  However, the largest Christian organizations spend most of their effort evangelizing by word of mouth and by funding charitable work, not by distributing bibles.      7) Who woulda thought that In general, anything written in the bible is just like a fable.    Well, a few would have thought that.  Christians, Muslims and Jews, to name just a few billions of people, tend to think differently.      8) It's designed to make you fear the future and force yourself to believe the impossible like walking on water and raising the dead and 7 headed dragons and crap like that.    You've clearly never read the bible, nor do you know its history.      9) It was all a bunch of ancient propaganda to trick people into believing stuff that would make them easier to brainwash.    So, instructions like, "we should follow the commands of God, not men" (v 19)  http://www.studybibleforum.com/htm_php.p...    was propaganda produced by the Roman officials in order to brainwash people into doing what the government told them to do, right?      10) Everyone knows that people are easier to brainwash if they are trained to believe impossible things    Wow!  For some inexplicable reason, that piece of common knowledge was never presented to me at any time during my education.      11) Now really! Does that make sense to you?    As it is actually told and explained in Scripture, it makes sense.  As you paraphrase and twist it without explanation, no, it doesn't make sense.  But, if I were to say  "Newton said that when you start moving, you'll keep moving in the same direction until something stops you or turns you, and there's all sorts of invisible things that can stop you or turn you even though you can't see them or feel them."    Now, really!  Does that make sense to you?    Jim, http://www.bible-reviews.com/selector_rc...|`|AA11466759	no.  that's just a load of trash there in your detail.

When you see a classmate of yours, speak Japanglish with them [English with Japanese tossed in there]. You can also watch the movies you'd normally watch in Japanese [if that's an option] with english subtitles. This is how I've learned to keep my french fresh.

T939btrHaa	omg.. tha is so so not fair.  she should trust you cause   you were being honest   about why you were sneaking out.  ugh if only parents  knew how to compromise  and understand your side =P   im soory hun. =/   try talking to her about it?  thats what i do...|`|Mry1PfdGaa	I honestly think she did the right thing. I think it was a little crazy to bolt up the door and stuff.  But you should at least get your phone back! If you are not allowed to go out, tell her that if you get your phone or computer back, you wouldn't have to sneak out because it is a way to communicate.    Good luck and I hope I helped!!! =)|`|MK5Ddtiiaa	I can't believe your Mom said bj. That is weird.

And make sure if she does let you out again  to answer your phone /texts  Just gain her trust   And don't lie.  And 17 ,make sure you can handle that . He could be with HS girls  Be careful and gain her trust|`|r9s0VyJgaa	Yes its fair.    You've been sneaking out to see a boy your parents don't want you to date, you lied to your mom and tried to use your dad as your excuse to get out of the house.      If your mom took your computer, how did you get online to post this?|`|A5gfxSyzaa	I think if you want privilages back you'll have to earn them.

You have to remember that she's your mom and she thinks she's protecting you. Talk to her about it and make sure you don't lose your temper or else you'll get nowhere. Be calm and tell her why you think it's not fair.|`|rxQ4wtnkaa	No this isnt really fair u should be allowed to go places but u just cant go to someones house and have some one say get out and say that isnt fair it isnt yo house so no it is not fair in my opinion|`|uYQetMBpaa	Maybe you should really think about what would happen if you do get your freedom...

mMo2hwUBaa	Churches are private organizations and they can ban whomever they like.  It is called freedom of religion.  Only trouble makers would go where they aren't wanted.  Or someone planning a terrorist attack.  Which are you?|`|jdRKZe18aa	I doubt that is legal or possible - unless there is some violent behavior that a judge would give someone a restraining order to avoid....   BUT NO, churches are public places and open to ALL - you can't BAN someone from a church.    And, just for the record, when someone is excommunicated they ARE NOT banned from church.|`|Kfv2UP6Aaa	That wouldn't be very Christian, now would it?      Well, most things they do aren't.|`|QLDMmp6Taa	Well if they are harassing people at a congregation or causing problems, there can be a restraining order issued.  Kind of weird someone would want to belong to a church that doesn't want them there though.|`|78a004f4953e767d0c2c36ffd1bf1c39aa	There is Biblical guidelines for the removal of someone from the body of Christ.  Other than this they are not to do so.  I do not believe the First Amendment law can be applied to a Church with all that harping on separation.  You have a right to religion and even free speech, but if you are disruptive or out of  the will of God why would you wish to be there?|`|806025c44dd8e27b6c1d544348b087c0aa	It depends.      What if the person is harassing another member who already has an order of protection against him/her, but this person keeps violating it.    Keep in mind that churches are PRIVATE property owned by PRIVATE organizations, and therefore are allowed to ban anyone from entering.  You might not like it, but they do.  People might have a right to their own personal religion, but they don't have the right to membership in any particular group.  Just like I can't go to a Mormon temple because I'm not Mormon (even some Mormons can't go to their own temple).    If you don't believe me,  just try to go walk through your local public elementary school and see what happens.|`|vNGjgygCaa	The day Churches start banning or excommunicating people is the day we need to tax the little farts.|`|c85dfb73b5d99dcbc373b5a788901bc7aa	If the person is a genuine threat, the leader of any organization can legally have him banned from the premises.    A similar argument might involve sending someone to prison. Does it violate someone's rights if they get sent to prison and thus can no longer go to the church of their choice? No, because their behavior caused them to lose that right.|`|WQvqLnnhaa	The church has the right to put someone out of the church. They do not need a court to determine this.    Ted Haggard was excommunicated....    Excommunication is not used very often any more in the church... they have become way too tolerant.|`|b5b22241b72a751e94c18311e3dd0dddaa	It IS private property|`|tLGbtmGsaa	Only if they were considered a big threat like they were going to harm or kill someone otherwise no I don't think right to ban anyone from church.

Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!     Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead.

Haec enim est tyrannorum vita nimirum, in qua nulla fides, nulla caritas, nulla stabilis benevolentiae potest esse fiducia, omnia semper suspecta atque sollicita, nullus locus amicitiae."     "53. Quis enim aut eum diligat, quem metuat, aut eum, a quo se metui putet? Coluntur tamen simulatione dumtaxat ad tempus. Quodsi forte, ut fit plerumque, ceciderunt, tum intellegitur, quam fuerint inopes amicorum. Quod Tarquinium dixisse ferunt exulantem, tum se intellexisse, quos fidos amicos habuisset, quos infidos, *** iam neutris gratiam referre posset."     "54. Quamquam miror, illa superbia et inportunitate si quemquam amicum habere potuit."    'Who, by the faith of gods and men, would wish to overflow with wealth and to live amid an abundance of all things on condition that he should neither love anyone nor be himself loved by anyone? This, of course, is the life of tyrants, in which there can be neither confidence, nor affection, nor firm reliance on the kindly feeling of others: their whole life is full of mistrust and anxiety, and for friendship there is no room."    "53. For who could love either a man whom he fears, or a man by whom he thinks he is feared? Yet tyrants are courted through hypocrisy, at least for a season. But if, as usually happens, they chance to fall, then men see how poor they were in friends. And so Tarquinius is related to have said when in exile, that he knew at last which of his friends were faithful and which unfaithful, since then he could show gratitude to neither."     "54. And yet I am surprised that a man of his haughtiness and perversity could have any friend.'|`|6ybAFZuAaa	Anyone is quae skirmish upon omnium rerum abundance and so vivere when worthless diligent quemquam worthless himself counting from ullo diligatur|`|0835d5aaaff88c49c30c004c7854c920aa	Yeah, Latin teachers shuffle the text up so the students can't just copy the translation.

If you meant "another chance", change it for "otra oportunidad    any doubt, write me back  Good luck!

839be5UKaa	In Irish if you want to say "will do X for Y" (as in willing to do X for Y) you say "T m ssta..."

0cc161ff5c4a48e6e463a279c916b3d0aa	Your rule is that you have to get married in the catholic church. You can marry a non-catholic if he agrees (not just if you intend) to raise the children catholic.<br>  <br>  If neither of you are willing to abandon your faith, there is probably not much chance of this working. Your best bet would be to discuss the idea of god and come to a universalist understanding - all religions worship the same god and make up silly rules to distinguish themselves from other religions.<br>  <br>  Actually, your best bet would be for both of you to become Agnostics or Atheists but that doesn't sound like an option at this point in your lives.|`|E71jweytaa	yes you can be married in the catholic church, under the provision that all your children be baptized and raised catholic|`|JTu1cLkYaa	My neighbors, when I was growing up, were a Mormon/Catholic couple.

Just Acknowledge Him!  :)|`|KWwW7N49aa	You can do it quietly at home.  I did.  Just talk to God and tell him that you believe that he sent his Son to pay the penalty for my sins and that you are very sorry that you were rebellious towards him.  Ask God to forgive you and give you a clean heart.  He will come because you invited him into your life.  Then if you have a Bible, start reading the book of John first and really study it. Ask God to open your eyes and heart to receive his Word.  If you have a Christian friend, talk with him/her when you have questions or come on Yahoo.  Eventually you will want to go to church.  I know what you mean about the attention and that will go away too.  Let me know if you need any help. God bless you as you search the truth.|`|E9chZY74aa	You can not be saved alone.  Someone has to baptize you as you are dead and are buried in a watery grave and then resurrected.  Remember, Peter said in Acts 2:38 that you must do this in order to have your sins washed away and Paul said in Romans 6 that you must be resurrected from the water or you will not be resurrected in the last days.  Another Christian must do the baptizing.|`|OhhnWvjuaa	If you want Jesus to save your soul all you have to do is accept him.

A man came to my door witnessing to me, and everything he said just touched me in a way that I had never been touched before, so I went into my bedroom and got on my knees, and just started praying to God, and that was the day that I really realized that Christ had paid my sin debt at the cross, and that I for sure was unworthy of his love. So that is my story of the day that Christ found me. I didn't find him, cause Christ was never lost. I was the one that was lost.|`|Ar80Ri8eaa	Just accept Jesus Christ if that's what you mean by "saved". <br>  <br>  Invite Christ into your life, commit to living a life where you try to avoid sinning, ask for forgiveness of your sins and accept Jesus and that he died for you to be forgiven. It doesn't matter the exact words that you say, you just have to accept Christ, acknowledge that he died for you, for your sins to be forgiven, ask for forgiveness, and commit to living as righteously as you can. <br>  <br>  <br>  I am not a bible thumper or a religious kind of person at all but I do believe in God and this is all you have to do.|`|jg5Ii27Vaa	Romans 10:9-10<br>  <br>  9 That if you confess with your mouth, "Jesus is Lord," and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved. <br>  10 For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.<br>  <br>  that's all you need to do.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|0FxsiVHnaa	i wasnt at church when i got saved. i dont think it has anything to do with where you are. it was simple for me; i just asked God to forgive my sins and to save me. honestly, i dont think there is a specific way to do it.|`|sebhK7r7aa	Being saved doesn't involve going to church.

Lust is like adultery. We are born with sin, and there is no sin that we can be without. We are just merely sinful.|`|HBp5r76haa	Yours is a convoluted question... let's try to answer in fe words:<br>  <br>  Remember that we are not sinners because we sin, but we sin because we are sinners. And that, apart from the grace and mercy of God, through the redeeming sacrifice of Jesus Christ, our LORD, we are all lost and on our way to Hell. But we have been declared righteous by His blood, and for this we must rejoice!<br>  <br>  Upon repentance, and believing in the WORD (i.e Jesus), the Holy Spirit came dwelling in us - therefore we are now new creations - born again from above. So our "old" nature, the sinful one, had died to our new self. Therefore, if you are a believer in Jesus Christ, no sin should be in you. It does not mean that you will never sin, but it should mean that your relationship to sin and to a worldly life has changed.<br>  <br>  I am not sinless, or perfect - but I am being perfected, purified and sanctified by the Spirit of God. And for this I thank Him|`|uFAoq4idaa	I have many sins in me. I am proud, I am selfish, I am self centered and I use to curse people when I don't like them. But God rebuked me every time I sinned and that I admit my fault immediately. God is compassionate and always forgiving. He doesn't want me to go to hell. So He used  to rebuke me when I committed sins.That's the beauty of being a child of God. God rebukes and discipline me as His own child. And I welcome His rebukes and disciplines. Praise His Holy Name.

I would not wear a doo rag in any of these situations:<br>  <br>  -Weddings<br>  -Funerals (unless it's the funeral of your very close homeboy - haha)<br>  -Going to the movies<br>  -Going to the store<br>  -Plays and concerts that are NOT rap concerts.  <br>  -A poetry reading<br>  -To meet your significant other's parents or other family<br>  -family reunions<br>  <br>  Why is it so bad?  Doo rags are obviously very informal.  They are not dressy in any way, and they are associated with rap/hiphop/gangster culture.  This scares and repulses people (especially middle class white people, but can you blame them?).  It's rude to scare and repulse people!<br>  <br>  Doo rags are similar to using swear words.  Yeah, they're cool, they're fun. But they make you out to be of lower intelligence, lower class, poor manners, etc.  They're appropriate in some situations, but they're not made for anything more than the most casual.  People judge us based on our clothes and our words. If you want to be respected, and not prejudiced against, make your words and clothing respectable.<br>  <br>  Who do you think would be more likely to get a job?

(9) Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.<br>  <br>  ????????So, actual conviction is to come from the Holy Spirit.  However, if we know our brother is sinning, we are required to mention it to them -- not try to convict them, but we are to mention it so that they can begin thinking about their sin and the Holy Spirit can work on them while they think about it.  We are not to turn a blind eye to sin on the excuse that it is not our job to convict others of sin.  That is the devil's lie.<br>  <br>  EDIT: In short, those whom have turned a blind eye to God's Truth, such as yourself, need a human voice to speak to them because they will not hear the Holy Spirit anymore.

4uike3ARaa	In the best Will Roger's style, I usually ask a question in a humorous way, trying to elicit responses along the same vein, but with an eye towards current events.<br>  Usually my questions get deleted. Reported. Whatever. Yes, I have a left-leaning slant, but I really, really want to engage in real discussion of the issues, rather than of the parties.<br>  Anyone who feels the same way, feel free to email me. Let's discuss current events!
3OZgcntfaa	"I am a man who was born with a condition at birth the doctor's didn't notice.<br>  <br>  My body doesn't produce enough testosterone without assistance to promote masculine features, therefore when my body was told to go into puberty feminine features developed.<br>  <br>  I am under the supervision of medical professionals to adjust the situation so I can live comfortably in my own skin."<br>  <br>  That's my speech for when someone isn't going to understand what I mean by "trans". I'll bet with modifications it can be used for transwomen too.|`|swkhohjgaa	A lot of people have a problem with the word defect. I don't care for the word myself, a variation is probably nicer word. <br>  <br>  But to be honest I don't care what word is used as long as it gets the point across. I believe the general population would better understand that its not a choice, that is the way we are born, if they hear a word they can relate to.  <br>  <br>  In my humble opinion. I dont care what they call me or my condition if it gets the point across. I'll worry about the finer points later.|`|VRsu7c3Paa	I wouldn't say defect...typically (from what I know about biology which isn't much) FtMs have increased testosterone vs "female/woman" in the womb. This increased testosterone level can change the person to feel more masculine, and male.<br>  <br>  I believe it's the opposite for MtFs...I might be able to source it if I can remember where I heard it.|`|766d5b80d7a637c2204d9d127fb86200aa	I'm not transgendered but my brother is. He's told my family that he's been secretly cross-dressing since he was about five. I'm not sure if it's a birth defect or not but he REALLY wants the operation so something tells me it's a since-birth thing.|`|4ab8439e5bb68131be2c8b6ff9ed3557aa	As far as science can tell right now, being transsexual is a birth defect and I explain it as such. Basically, hormones in the womb got messed up and the brain was wired as one sex while the body developed as something else.<br>  <br>  Of course, that's the current theory and seems to make the most sense. It's what I believe, though I fully admit that it might not be completely accurate and I am aware that others likely believe differently. Still, a biological mistake would explain why some trans people have physical issues... for example, a lot of transmen seem to have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome and naturally high levels of testosterone. Not sure what might go on with transwomen, but it's interesting nonetheless.<br>  <br>  I also sometimes say that I was male in a past life and was supposed to be this time, too, but someone fell asleep at the factory controls and I got mixed up on the assembly line. :P When I'm in a more mystical woowoo mood, anyhow.<br>  <br>  Cheers.|`|XkE36LDgaa	I'm not trans, but I think I can answer some.<br>  <br>  It's hard to explain and a lot of people won't understand...but there are some who do. Not only other transexuals but just others. I could understand....but that might be because I'm interested in psychology.<br>  <br>  It's not a birth defect. It's just the way you are. Some people hate or call you a freak or messed up for feeling that way but it's not really a defect. After all; trans can live fine and be working and good people in sociaty.|`|EfIXhZdqaa	To call it a "defect" I think is very harsh. But yes, it is caused by some sort of prenatal mixup when the baby's body develops as the wrong gender.|`|2RzEaod9aa	I didn't know, either, until I became friends with a transgendered person.

Science is constantly contradicting itself, scientists want to pat themselves on the back for such long winded answers that have no real evidence to back up their theories. They claim "time and pressure" over billions of years could only produce the results we have...what about the flood? Imagine how much pressure water of such depths could produce on the layers of earth that we dig up and study in mountain rocks and sediment? (which by the way, all show proof of a flood at the same time in history). Crushing pressure...just 2 miles down, water pressure is 3 tons per square inch, try to imagine another few miles deeper. That's just one convincing argument...|`|6ec55368aa773b05b3b9440af5f7fc50aa	One guy centuries ago tried to come up how old based on genealogy of the people in the Bible.But what he forgot.How long is a day to an immortal being?So it would be older then 6000.|`|TnYNGZiLaa	They lied to force their believers follow their dogmas.<br>  No basis.|`|j4j8TXSVaa	We have an unbroken timeline from Adam to Jesus.

When I want to learn about the physical world, I read a science book.  <br>  <br>  peace|`|sebhK7r7aa	Here's a good article for that:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c012.html" rel="nofollow">http://christiananswers.net/q-aig/aig-c0...</a>|`|NZ0mRaG3aa	Only creationist christians think that way. Probably because they are not very interested in Science, and men like Dawkins argue incorrectly that evolution disproves God and they don't want to waste time arguing so just take all theBible literally.<br>  <br>  The 6000 years orginally estimation comes from Bishop Usher (4004 BC according to him!) and I think is based on genealogies, and guesses at how long people were living at different times.<br>  <br>  Many christians regard the very early chapters as not literal, but with very symbolic meaning, a meaning that gets developed later in the Bible. But we don't believe men are just animals and that evolution explains everything, since the experience of salvation is very real, and one can encounter some very supernatural manifestations that certainly can't be explained if one just thinks humans are animals and there is no God.|`|I3rjYVUFaa	The Bible says so:<br>  <br>  Genesis 5:3 And Adam lived 130 years, and begot Seth<br>  Genesis 5:6 Seth lived 105 years, and begot Enosh<br>  Genesis 5:9 Enosh lived 90 years, and begot Cainan<br>  Genesis 5:12 Cainan lived 70 years, and begot Mahalalel<br>  Genesis 5:15 Mahalalel lived 65 years, and begot Jared<br>  Genesis 5:18 Jared lived 162 years, and begot Enoch<br>  Genesis 5:21 Enoch lived 65 years, and begot Methuselah<br>  Genesis 5:25 Methuselah lived 187 years, and begot Lamech<br>  Genesis 5:28 Lamech lived 182 years, and begot Noah<br>  Genesis 5:32 Noah lived 500 years, and begot Shem, Ham, and Japheth<br>  Genesis 11:10 Shem lived 100 years, and begot Arphaxad 2 years after the Flood<br>  <br>  Add all these up and you get 1,654 years from Adam until the Flood + 2 years and Arphaxad was born. We continue in Genesis 11:12 Arphaxad lived 35 years, and begot Shelah<br>  Genesis 11:14 Selah lived 30 years, and begot Eber<br>  Genesis 11:16 Eber lived 34 years, and begot Peleg<br>  Genesis 11: 18 Peleg lived 30 years, and begot Reu<br>  Genesis 11:20 Reu lived 32 years, and begot Serug<br>  Genesis 11:22 Serug lived 30 years, and begot Nahor<br>  Genesis 11:24 Nahor lived 29 years, and begot Terah<br>  Genesis 11:26 Terah lived 70 years, and begot Abram, Nahor, and Haran.<br>  (Abram's name was later changed by God to Abraham--see Genesis 17:5) So, if you add up these numbers, you get 290 years from the flood to Abraham.<br>  Now, if you skip over to Matthew 1:17, you will see that it was 14 generations from Abraham to David, 14 generations from <br>  David to Deportation to Babylon, and 14 generations from Bablylon to Messiah. This is 42 generations from Abraham to Jesus. If we make an assumption of 36 years per generation, this places Jesus birth at 1,512 years after Abraham.<br>  So, to summarize, we have 1,654 years from the beginning (Adam) to the Flood, then 290 years to Abraham, then 1,512 years (give or take a week) from Abraham to Jesus. Jesus was born in 4 BC, so from then til now is 2,013 years. This adds up to 5,468 years for the age of the earth; based on an assumption of 36 years per generation. You can rerun the figures based upon a strict 40 years per Biblical generation, but you won't get millions or billions.|`|uAMzmAwaaa	i don't and some people say the Bible says it, but it doesn't in fact it gives way too many holes in the time line to give an exact amount of years, or even estimate.|`|JH6oCuUZaa	There are trees alive right now over 6000 years old....look it up.

3DjUX8etaa	I will give you two different answers. The first is the Christian answer.Yes, God knew he would rebel. But like mankind, God would not stop him due to his free will to decide for himself. Now I will give you the Jewish answer. They do not believe Satan ever rebelled. They do not believe angels have the free will that humans do, so rebelling would be impossible. Jews believe Satan is still in heaven obeying all of God's commands. A bit confusing, isn't it?

Why did he create humanity?  He created it because that small percentage that would humble themselves and follow Jesus were worth it.<br>  <br>  John 3: 16 "For God loved the world in this way: He gave His One and Only  Son, so that everyone who believes in Him will not perish but have eternal life.<br>  <br>  Jesus is the son of God and the Saviour (Messiah/Christ) as written about 700 years before Jesus was born in Isaiah,<br>  Isaiah 53<br>  5 But he was pierced for our transgressions, <br>         he was crushed for our iniquities; <br>         the punishment that brought us peace was upon him, <br>         and by his wounds we are healed.<br>  6 All of us like sheep have gone astray,<br>      Each of us has turned to his own way;<br>      But the LORD has caused the iniquity of us all<br>      To fall on Him.<br>  <br>  God's mercy and love gave us the freedom of choice and Jesus took the blame and payed for the sins of humanity that are willing to follow him,  and he also gave Satan the choice to follow or rebel but with no second chance for him.<br>  <br>  Henry Drummond talks about love and our relationship with God in his book "The Greatest thing in the World", I think it is a good read and here is a link where it is available for free online.  <br>  <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/16739" rel="nofollow">http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/16739</a>|`|N6cCc9dOaa	God knows everything that will happen before it happens so yes He knew what Satan would do.He created Satan so that the unfaithful servants(Man) would be punished.|`|1zqepxAaaa	Honestly, I couldn't agree with you more!

wcOq60Hhaa	The simple answer to your question is that you are making an assumption that is perfectly "logical" in common parlance but has no basis in scientific fact:  human laws and scientific laws are not the same.  <br>  <br>  That is, human laws require a "designer" (a human) to create and enforce the law.<br>  <br>  Scientific laws are (working) descriptions of the way things work.  They are not "laws" that require enforcement nor do they need a designer or "writer."<br>  <br>  For example #1, if the law of gravity is found to be wrong in some way, science would not say that the law of gravity has been broken.  Science would say the definition of gravity is wrong and it would amended the description to take into account the new, more accurate, data.  This is exactly what happened when Einstein's theories challenged Newtons assumptions.  They were not Newton's laws to "break;" rather we say that Newton's descriptions were flawed in part and Einstein's descriptions corrected them.<br>  <br>  For example #2, would you argue that red+blue=purple has a purpose?  That seems highly unlikely to me.  It is a very narrow description of what we observe (at a very high level) in nature.   It is not a law in any meaningful sense; nor -- when you get right down to it -- does it have much meaning to "science" outside of elementary school.  For the most part, I think you will find the same is true with the populations general understanding of evolution.  In the first part, it is a description, not a law; In the second, it is a simplified presentation that has less to do with science than with education.|`|QQ2rTaPdaa	"if it was not under any law as stated by you the Atheist,"<br>  <br>  We've never said that. All atheist recognize the laws of science. Its you Christians who insist they can be broken at random.<br>  <br>  Its not random chance. Due to the laws of science (which boils down to the way atoms and molecules interact with eachother) life was inevitable. Odds are there are, have been, and will be many more forms of life in the universe that arise from the laws of science.|`|hmU2udmRaa	what are you trying to figure out?  evolution or the laws of the universe?  your problem is you're trying to condense too much information in hopes of simplifying (or rather oversimplifying) what has taken our brightest minds the better part of their lives to figure out.  my suggestion to you is to study one thing at a time.  if you want to know about universal constants, i suggest you speak with a physicist.  if you want to know about chemistry, i suggest you speak with a chemist.  if you want to know about evolution, i suggest you speak to a biologist.  eventually you will see that all the different fields of science do agree with one another.|`|X548yCR6aa	Who claims "all is random chance" except ignorant people?<br>  <br>  The cosmic forces (gravity, magnetism, strong and weak nuclear) are the basic constants of our universe.

"<br>  <br>  Life itself has no purpose, it just is, but we humans find our own purpose in life.<br>  <br>  "all is random chance, then how come there is laws governing the universe, known laws that can not be moved but are perfectly balanced?"<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what you mean by 'perfectly balanced', that seems like a leap you've made there. But it's a moot point, anyway: if there were no laws you wouldn't be here asking this question. We have no way of knowing how (or if) chance comes into it.<br>  <br>  "Is not the law of evolution a standard that requires strict adherence<br>  too ?"<br>  <br>  No, evolution is not a law. The Theory of Evolution describes how life-forms adapt to their environments. It is not a law in any sense of the world.<br>  <br>  "if it was not under any law as stated by you the Atheist, then life could not exist, the universe could not exist with out these laws, all that would exist would be chaos."<br>  <br>  The laws of the universe are properties of the universe, but they have no effect on it's actual existence. The universe is defined as the dimensions of space and time, dimensions are not laws.<br>  <br>  "So which is it, chance or design?"<br>  <br>  Neither you nor I have any idea how chance comes into play.

Using these laws "physics" we have determined that there are alternate dimensions that do not adhere to our laws of physics. Before the singularity our known laws of physics did not apply. Also there is a reason for evolution. The survival of DNA. That is the rule. WHo wants it more, who is willing to do what ever it takes to get there DNA to the next generation. And how can we help that next generation survive. Maybe it's lungs instead of gills. Or 2 legs instead of 4. Though we may not understand all processes of nature and our universe that does not mean there are not scientific explanations. At one point all we knew was there were 5 planets, then 6 then 7 then 8 then 9 then 8. Science is an ever flowing system (as religion SHOULD be). Religion is rigid and this is why I feel it causes so many problems.|`|5urfAbazaa	Evolution does not have a goal, it is linear. Definition of evolution is the change in ALLELE FREQUENCY in a population.|`|AA11297267	Let's start by dispensing with all of your false assumptions:<br>  -- "all is random chance" nope. Chance is involved, but not all.  Natural selection keeps the good "chance" things and gets rid of the "chance" things that hurt reproductive success.<br>  <br>  -- "there is laws governing the universe"  no, there aren't.  There is just the way the universe is.  When we discover some constant in the universe that always works a certain way (like the inverse-square falloff of gravity's strength), we call it a "law" -- but that's entirely a man-made concept.  The universe has no intelligence or concept of "law," it just is the way it is.  And by the way, if many of those constants were considerably different, there would still be a universe, and possibly even life.  Gravity's falloff could vary considerably from an inverse-square value, and the universe would still exist and there could still be life.<br>  <br>  -- "are perfectly balanced" no, they're not.  They're just the way they are.  If the universe didn't allow for life, you wouldn't be here asking questions about it.  That doesn't imply design, you're working backwards from the end result to draw incorrect conclusions.<br>  <br>  Chance and design aren't the only two possibilities.  It's false to say it HAS to be EITHER chance OR design.  While chance plays a role in many cases, once a chance event has happened natural processes (such as natural selection) can take advantage of a chance event and apparent design can emerge - naturally.<br>  <br>  Your major failure is to assume that the universe or life "needs strict laws."  The laws you speak of are just names we've given the constants of nature, and we don't "need" any of them -- we're the product of them being the way they are.  If they had been different, life still might have evolved but been very different...and then beings who make incorrect assumptions would be asking about the apparent "design" of a very different universe.<br>  <br>  You're here *because* the universe is the way it is and allowed your kind of life to develop.  The universe isn't the way it is because you're here.  You've got it backwards.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|4sUek7ugaa	What an incredible list of lies!<br>  <br>  We do not state that life has no meaning or purpose.  That's just one of the lies you guys spread about us.<br>  <br>  We do not state that all life is the result of random chance.  That's a combination of a lie and a misunderstanding of evolution.  (Evolution is a combination of random and non-random processes.)<br>  <br>  The fact that there are laws governing the universe does not in any way prove your sky daddy.  In fact, it's further evidence that natural laws and processes can govern all the things you say Sky Daddy did.<br>  <br>  It's a creationist lie that science says that the universe and everything in it is complete chance.  It's also a lie that everything must be either complete chance or micromanaged by your sky daddy.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  I just went back and checked your last question.  Not one single person said what you claim they said.  You must have some special filters on your monitor that makes the words change.  Or maybe you're lying.  I'm not sure.|`|KfG4cv6Yaa	It is not necessarily chance or design.  It could be that there have been a sufficient number of 'proto-universes' for this one to have been necessary.  Since it is currently impossible to know about the other universes (if they existed), the question is difficult to answer.  This fact, however, is not in any way at all proof of design.|`|8urFS6RMaa	You have just crossed over into the "Poe's Law" Zone...|`|wwdllMzYaa	an orderd chaos and a chaotic order formed from existence of the universe, probably long before this universe<br>  where it leads to a stability, a balance, and things created in that balance, also have a balance,  if you notice most if not all things, have an oposite side, light dark, good bad, happy sad, soft hard, etc etc<br>  <br>  the laws formd this, or they formed from the laws, of balance and order, based on chaos,<br>  if thee was no chas, there woudl be no order<br>  <br>  things are not 'perfectly designed'<br>  they just work together<br>  <br>  evolution has no 'strict adherance'<br>  if it did there would be no mutations, and hence no evolution<br>  <br>  evolution is based on mutations, changes, adaptations<br>  ergo, again, order, and chaos, workign together<br>  to form a law of the universe

mVsWyu0yaa	Yes...and if you go to Israel you can see three different tombs from which he was resurrected. lol <br>  <br>  The 'empty' tomb myth was as essential to Christianity, as the 'hidden tomb' myth of Moses was to Judaism.  Mythical characters HAVE to have empty tombs or tombs that no one can find. <br>  <br>  You can't disprove something that is not there.<br>  <br>  p.s. Why, in the name of common sense, would Jesus NEED a body in heaven???? <br>  <br>  All anyone, with a mind , need do is read the ridiculously contradictory "Easter" events in the gospels to understand that the entire Resurrection scenario was a MYTH. <br>  <br>   The alleged eye-witnesses could not agree on anything...not the number of 'angels', not the time of day, not the first persons to arrive, not whether the stone was in place or rolled away....just a silly mish-mosh of hear-say.|`|U51pBeLfaa	Crucifixion was one method to kill the leader of a movement in order to stop the movement.<br>  <br>  The fact that Christianity is a full grown religion means that the crucifixion did not work for some reason. Jesus survived the crucifixion. Perhaps Jesus resuscitated rather than resurrected. Perhaps there was a switch as the Muslims believe. We don't know.<br>  <br>  Today anyone who has seriously studied the facts on Jesus' death agree that Jesus resurrected.<br>  There is nobody going around saying that Jesus resuscitated as far as I know. There are plenty of people going around dismissing historical evidence which I think distracts from their credibility.<br>  As for Muslims, Allah bless them, they keep insisting on divine revelation where what I want is at least some continuity with written scripture during the intervening years between the event and the record. I could only account for their version as being true if it was accurately passed on by word of mouth which they deny was the means of transmission.<br>  <br>  So on the balance of probabilities it is most probable that Jesus resurrected.|`|gHSarVD1aa	I will answer your question because there is a one in a million chance you actually want to know.<br>  <br>  We can trace the Apostles who walked with Jesus through the fellowships, some of which are still standing in Israel and Iraq today.

And if you think you are doing good, think again. If you believe that you are superior to anyone because of what you say, you are very wrong and could be very close to blasphemy. People do not respond to any person telling them what to do (Jesus Christ was the only exception). Paul was not a prophet, nor was he anyone exceptional. He was an ordinary man with many physical and mental health issues and was in jail the entire time he wrote his words that are in the New Testament. <br>  <br>  Even if our bodies are 'lowly' and get sick and die, and even if it is true that if people follow a believer's life, they will receive a "glorious" body in the after life, each individual person decides for themself what they want.

lNtwpzpOaa	You know, you used to ask decent questions, now it seems like you're just trying to come up with anything against Catholicism. <br>  <br>  Is it that you are trying to find a reason *not* to become Catholic that you are now grasping at straws? You should read "Born Fundamentalist, Born Again Catholic", I think it might help you.<br>  <br>  Onto your question. <br>  <br>  <<”Most rightly", says the Catechism, "has the Holy Church of God added to this thanksgiving, petition also and the invocation of the most holy Mother of God, thereby implying that we should piously and suppliantly have recourse to her in order that by her intercession she may reconcile God with us sinners and obtain for us the blessing we need both for this present life and for the life which has no end.">><br>  <br>  Very true.<br>  <br>  <<That last sentence basically gives Mary the powers that only Jesus the Christ has since Paul said that there is only One Mediator and One Holy Spirit that gives us intercession.>><br>  <br>  This says intercessor, not mediator, there is a difference. <br>  <br>  A mediator is one who interposes between parties at variance for the purpose of reconciling them. Only Jesus Christ can do this. No one else could. <br>  <br>  But mediator and intercessor are two separate things. Yes, they are related, but a mediator (Jesus) brings together two disputing parties (God and Man) that would not have been able to be brought together otherwise and an intercessor speaks for someone (Mary praying to God for us).<br>  <br>  Yes, St. Paul says that Jesus is the only Mediator between God and man, but St. Paul also says in 1 Timothy 2:1-2 that we are to pray for each other, ask for prayers and to intercede and ask for intercession. <br>  <br>  Jesus Christ is the only person that could bridge the gap between God and man, it is only by His constant mediatorship that we can even fathom a chance to spend eternity in Heaven with Him. Jesus is the only Mediator between God. But we can intercede for each other and St. Paul actually tells us that this is PLEASING to God, not against God. <br>  <br>  As we believe in the Communion of Saints and as St. Paul teaches we are part of the mystical Body of Christ that transcends from Heaven to earth, we know that those who are no longer living on this earth are still alive in Christ. As Christ destroyed death, all are alive in Him, including those who have passed into the next world. <br>  <br>  <br>  <<So why is Mary seen as God when Mary was just a woman??>><br>  <br>  First of all, Mary isn’t “just a woman”, she was chosen from the very beginning of salvation to bear the Son of God. This can be seen in Genesis when God prophecies about “the woman” who will bear the Savior. <br>  <br>  Secondly, Catholics understand Mary to be the Ark of the Covenant. The first Ark carried the Word of God and the manna from Heaven. The second Ark (Mary) carries the Living Word of God and the Living Manna from Heaven. The first Ark was overshadowed by God’s “glory cloud” and only Mary is overshadowed by God’s “glory cloud” when she conceives Jesus. <br>  <br>  So she’s not just a woman, but we do not see her as God. She is certainly not God and any Catholic that claims otherwise is not Catholic. The Catholic Church will be the first to claim that Mary is the handmaid of the Lord and that she is not God nor could she save humanity, only Jesus could. <br>  <br>  But, we do not deny that as the Mother of God, her prayers are certainly heard. She works with Jesus to reconcile sinners to God, not independently. <br>  <br>  Think about it this way, when you and your wife (I’m assuming you’re a man) create a child, you are co-creators with God. Not because God needs a co-creator (He created us), but because it is pleasing to Him to work with us. Without God, no child could be conceived, but God works with us so that we may create a child with Him.<br>  <br>  When we bring someone to Christ, we are co-redeemers with Him. It is Christ who redeems that person, but we are working with Christ to bring someone to Him. And this is pleasing to Him. We are to work with each other and help each other, this includes the Communion of Saints as they can help us more than our earthly brothers and sisters because they have been perfected in the Blood of the Lamb and share the glory of eternal life with God.<br>  <br>  It says by her intercession, that is praying for us, may we be brought back to God and grace obtained for us by her prayers. She cannot grant us grace nor can she save us, but she can work with God and obtain for us blessings in this life and the next. <br>  <br>  She is not God, nor do we ever believe her to be such. But she is certainly the highest of the Saints, she is the first Christian and she is the Mother of God. As St. Gabriel said, “Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee!” She is special and always will be, but she is not God.|`|fcf19f1cefff180142fdd088f485f67baa	She is not seen as God.  Period.

Will you all please take a course in English and realize that to ask someone for help, is just that. We are asking our Blessed Mother for help. How else can we put it. Just like we petition the Saints in heaven for the same thing. What is it with you that you keep harping on the same subject all the time. Don't you get it at all.<br>  You may not have any friends up there in heaven, but we do. And if you want we are willing to share. It's not a monopoly, they will help you too, so won't Mary our Mother. God bless you.<br>  <br>  BTW She is not seen as a god in the catechism of the Catholic church, how ever we do honor Her for She is the Mother of God. Don't you honor your mother. And you don't have to be Catholic to ask Her anything, She'll listen and bring all your wants to Her Son Jesus.|`|zHle6Paqaa	Because Paul said so ;)<br>  <br>  LOL!<br>  <br>  BTW "Sarcasm"<br>  <br>  Scripture teaches we can be subordinate mediators or intercessors in Christ because this is what God invites us to be. <br>  <br>  *Paul says our mediation is “good and acceptable" to God (1 Tim 2:3). I am encouraged that Mr. Lion of Judah acknowledges we can be mediators “in a limited sense."  We, along with Mary, are only mediators because of the one mediatorial role of Jesus Christ. <br>  <br>  Thus, our mediation is “limited" to the mediation of Christ. We cannot act as mediators independently of Christ, nor will God grant our petitions if they are inconsistent with the will of Christ. <br>  Theology is about making the proper distinctions. Mr. Lion of Judah is bent on elevating Mary’s mediatorial role to equal or even above Jesus, but he knows quite well that the Church teaches no such thing. Let’s try to be honest in this discussion.<br>  <br>  ADD:<br>  <br>  God promises that the woman's seed will "strike" or crush the head of the serpent.<br>  <br>  To crush the head of a serpent is to kill it. So what we have here is the promise of the serpent's death under the foot of the seed of a "woman", that is under the foot of the woman's child. <br>  <br>   <br>  First, it forsees a new "woman," a new Eve, and her "seed," Jesus. This passage is the source of the description of Mary as "woman" in John's Gospel (see John 2:4; 19:26).<br>  <br>  This "woman" and her child were the focus of Christian expectations for a messiah, <br>  <br>  as Paul says:<br>  <br>   "when the fullness of time had come, God sent his Son, born of a "woman" . . ." (see Galatians 4:4)<br>  <br>  St. Paul too testifies that Jesus Christ "was made to him [God] of the seed of David, according to the flesh" (Romans 1:3). <br>  If Mary were not of Davidic descent, her Son conceived by the Holy Ghost could not be said to be "of the seed of David". Hence commentators tell us that in the text "in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God. . .to a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David" (Luke 1:26-27); the last clause "of the house of David" does not refer to Joseph, but to the virgin who is the principal person in the narrative; thus we have a direct inspired testimony to Mary's Davidic descent.<br>  <br>  EDIT: YES HE DID.|`|WNWKDw4uaa	I don't see where it says Mary is God.  You're wrong.  Stop bashing Catholics.|`|02c88162bffef072e5382461e8afc7f3aa	I'll be darned if i read what your reading in Marys Role in the Catechism or any Church statements.Asking us to ask Mary to pray for us is no more her being our mediator equal to Christ than if i asked for your prayers and petitioned you to be some one to watch out for me and pray for me.Nice try Lion but once again it's your failure of not understanding Catholic teaching.How do you know Paul never spoke of Mary as we only ended up even then with some of his letters and i'm certain every thing he talked about and practiced was not written down.And jesus is the only Mediator between GOD and man so then why does Paul instruct intercession or prayers for each other as they can not intercede.Get the idea Lion?Your Problem on this is you do not understand the communion of the saints.

Uac9AXmDaa	When God speaks to me, i feel a warm sensation that is caught in my chest, that works its way to my head, I feel butterflies in my stomach that moves to the throat like true intensive love.

It seems that i think i have life all figured out, but then i would be shown a different view and realize i was wrong. It seems the Holy spirit is at work to humble me more and more. So i do not walk proudly but humbled.<br>  <br>  This sometimes happens when i am alone, especially when i walk in an empty church. Leaving all the time and space for God and me. Sometime he speaks when i walk through an open field, or when the wind blows. <br>  <br>  Sometimes when God speaks through others i will get a Chile. Or warning of evil i will feel the Chile as well. <br>  <br>  Sometimes i feel like somethings is drawing me in a positive way. Like an energy or connection leading me somewhere.<br>  <br>  Sometime i feel as thought he wants something from me, but i don't know what it is.

In the old testament, most of the saints could not understand God's heart except for a few, like Moses and David. Moses knew God's ways are ways of mercy and grace. (Psalm 103:87-8) David was a man after God's heart, and he often sang of His lovingkindness, goodness, faithfulness and mercy.<br>  <br>  Jesus said that he who has seen Him has seen the Father. Jesus is the express image of the Father. We always see Jesus lifting up the downcast, restoring health to the sick, forgiving those who have fallen, protecting the weak and rescuing the lost. Jesus is the same yesterday, today and forever. (Hebrews 13:8)<br>  <br>  Today, we believers have the Holy Spirit dwelling in us forever. His voice is gentle, warm and friendly. That's how our Father speaks to us when He guides us in our daily decisions. He does not condemn nor nag at us. Instead, He assures us we are His children and He remembers our sins no more. God accepts us unconditionally because at the cross, He had rejected His own Son for six hours when His Son was carrying all our sins.<br>  <br>  God has a genuine interest in us - He cares about every little detail of our lives. He is like a loving father who always wants to outdo himself by giving his child pleasant surprises and presents. He knows the very number of hair on our heads - no detail escapes his attention. Jesus said, "If you, being evil, knows how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give good things to those who ask Him!" (Matthew 7:7-11) <br>  <br>  Jesus also said that it is our Father's good pleasure to give us the kingdom. His kingdom is "righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit". (Romans 14:17) God's style of giving is never stingy nor grudgingly; instead He loves to give good things to us cheerfully, freely, lavishly. Our God is an extravagant God - He doesn't seem to know the meaning of the word "enough". He always blesses us with more than enough. His grace is superabundant whenever we fail or fall short of our expectations - He gives grace to the humble - to those who know they are undeserving and are bold enough to take from Him. Great givers are great receivers. The more we receive grace and healing from our loving Abba Father, the more we will end up giving grace and healing to people around us. "Freely you have received, freely give". God bless you, brother Gary.|`|zp7aW6o7aa	If you hear Gods voice you will know it's God, if you are one of his chosen. You may think I'm a nut, but my testimony to you is this.  A little over five years ago, while searching for truth and reading the bible along with a lot of other books, I went to bed and my first of many spiritual experiences began my path to change.  God said my name.  His voice had so much love in it, I remember saying I wanted to come home  Then he covered me with his light and in that light I felt love I can't describe as his spirit flowed from the top of my head through my body and out the bottom of my feet.<br>  <br>  I awoke with no pain and a feeling of newness, which no water baptism or laying on of hands could ever do.

4ab8439e5bb68131be2c8b6ff9ed3557aa	Firstly, same sex marriage and polygamy are two entirely different battles. Just because one is legalized doesn't mean anything else will be legalized.<br>  <br>  However, if polygamists made a move to legalize it, I would support them. Throughout history and in most cultures, polygamy was the considered the norm. Monogamy only became popular after mainstream religions began to spread, Christianity specifically.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with more more than two people being in love. It happens all the time, only most people choose to break up with the first person to go after the second... aka, "serial monogamy". I have seen plenty of people with more than one partner have happy, healthy relationships based on openness and honesty. No cheating, no deceit, all love. I myself am polyamorous, and I have dated two people at the same time-- both knew of one another, and it only ended because one of my partners went psychopathic and was a danger to the rest of us.<br>  <br>  Sure, sometimes it falls apart and there have been scandals over the years involving it... but that happens with plain old one-on-one heterosexual marriage, too. <br>  <br>  No one should really be telling people who they can love and how many they can love. As long as it's consensual all around, then it should be allowed. Besides, they always say two heads are better than one... can you imagine the benefits there'd be to having two or more incomes, and the reduction on consumed resources like housing and all that?<br>  <br>  Cheers.|`|OLnmXeWDaa	These are totally different issues.<br>  <br>  No rational adult wants polygamy to be legal.

6Q4xh4F1aa	The Bible plainly states that the New Covenant applies to all men.<br>  <br>  "For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, a man, Christ Jesus, who gave himself a corresponding ransom for all" (Timothy 2:5,6)---<br>  <br>  Not surprisingly the Watchtower Society has an opposite view from the Scriptures.<br>  <br>  Regarding those who are not of their 144,000 anointed "Class" of people they say:<br>  "Christ does not act as Mediator of the new covenant toward them..."  (Watchtower of 2/15/1991 p.18).---<br>  <br>  Their second president, Judge rutherford speaking for the Watchtower taught that only 144,000 people make up the New Covenant, and that Jesus is mediator for them and them alone. Of the billions and billions of people that have ever lived, the New Covenant is only open to that special class of 144,000 people, of which 50,000 lived in the first half on the 1900's. <br>  <br>  By saying that the jw's can only have a relationship with their Savior if they are united with the Slave Class, Rutherford usurped tremendous power from Jesus onto himseelf and the following leaders of the Watchtower Organization, effectively creating the structure necessary for and indicative of a cult.  If Jesus is the Intermediary between God and the 144,000, then the Watchtower Society is set up as the intermediary between Christ and Men (Watchtower 11/15/1981 Page 21 Paragraph 18).<br>  <br>  Biblically speaking however,  there is no intermediary between humanity and Christ; Jesus is both our Mediator and High Priest. <br>  <br>  "But I want YOU to know that the head of every man is the Christ" <br>  (1 Corinthians 11:3).  <br>  <br>  So if they believe that the New Covenant is not applicable to all, then they are following a false teaching that betrays the truth of God's Word the Bible.|`|VJnuDRR9aa	New Testament Covenant applies to the heavenly class of 144,000 the majority of Jehovah's witnesses do not look forward to a Heavenly life but to a paradise earth  .They are not under the old law covenant they are under what the FDS teaches from excerpted verses of the bible which they have been taught applies to them "The Meek will inherit the earth" and  Thy kingdom come thy will be done "ON EARTH " and a few others like these all put together to say that they will live on a re established earthly paradise .I am not saying that they are wrong here I am just stating that although they believe in the covenant (NEW) and they feel that they will also benefit from it  but they do not believe that THEY  who consider themselves the "Other sheep" are IN the new covenant .|`|bTA5ndeMaa	You have hit the nail on its head here.  The great majority of the followers of the Wt are in no covenant relationship with God --<br>  <br>  Their baptism is forfeit -- why?  Because we are told that our baptism is for this : (Acts 2:38), " . . .let each one of YOU be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for forgiveness of YOUR sins. . ."<br>  <br>  Forgiveness of sins can only be had through the covenant of the blood, the new covenant. (Matthew 26:28) "for this means my 'blood of the covenant,' which is to be poured out in behalf of many for forgiveness of sins. . ."<br>  <br>  This blood of the covenant - is the blood of the new covenant. Thus all who are baptized are in this covenant -- unless, they claim not to be, in which case they are illegitimate sons of God and Christ.<br>  <br>  So, what we have is the trinitarian churches making a major sin with their teachings and the Wt committing a major sin by excluding their adherents from this must-be covenant if we are to have forgiveness of sins.<br>  <br>  How sad.|`|tManvxfQaa	I don't think the JW teaching follows any covenant of God and His Word, from what i understand from their writings and teachings....They follow only what some guy they call an elder or whatever he is and refuse to read and study Gods Word for themselves .|`|OlHFq87waa	Google Judge Rutherford to find out.|`|sDfBDXpXaa	I believe you are asking about jehovas witness' and no they do not follow the Tenach (old testiment). They, like other man made religion, have a hint a truth (such as not celebrating the pagan holidays like christmas) but they are mostly confused and living in a fantasy land.<br>  www.familybible.org|`|NWa45ZDIaa	You already know the answer, Nina. You know that JW's believe the entire Bible, both the Hebrew Scriptures (often referred to as the Old Testament) & the Christian Greek Scriptures (Often referred to as the New Testament). You know that JW's believe the entire Bible was inspired by God. (2 Timothy 3:16)<br>  <br>  Here's a link to an article that explains more about this, in case you REALLY want to know the answer to this question: <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/e/20070901/article_02.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/e/20070901/art...</a>|`|n5AXfWEfaa	This scripture is the only one I can think of that applies to the Watchtower:<br>  2nd Peter 2:1<br>  "But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will secretly introduce destructive heresies, even denying the sovereign Lord who bought them—bringing swift destruction on themselves."|`|5OucqEzFaa	According to Jehovah's Witnesses, the New Testament Covenant is ONLY for 144,000 people. Indeed, the entire New Testament was written for the benefit of this elite number, those who are anointed and have a heavenly hope. That means that 99.9% of Jehovah's Witnesses today are excluded from the New Testament Covenant because (as of April 2008) they only had 9,105 anointed Jehovah's Witnesses left. Only this tiny number of Jehovah's Witnesses can claim to be in the New Covenant and have had their sins forgiven. Only they can say Jesus is their mediator and can cry out "Abba! Father".<br>  <br>  Tragically, if you're not in the New Covenant and you attempt to live by the Old Testament Covenant, you're doomed to failure. The Law is perfect and sinful people cannot keep it, therefore they are condemned. Jehovah's Witnesses don't even attempt to live by the entire Old Testament covenant - they do not keep the Sabbath or the Leviticus laws about food and cleanliness.<br>  <br>  So the answer to your question is that the New Testament Covenant applies to only 9,105 of them (but there may be more after April 9) and they do not follow the Old Testament Covenant. This organisation is in the business of keeping people OUT of the New Covenant.|`|lQaLifTfaa	Are you talking about Jews? <br>  <br>  If so, they do not recognize the New Testament. They don't believe that Jesus was the Messiah. If I remember correctly, within the Torah, they go a little farther than the Old Testament, but even their Old Testament is a little different than what is found in the Christian Bible.|`|EJHhCDcaaa	You will see many different answers on here.  The ones that I laugh at is the ones that say they follow the whole bible.  This must be taught to them by the Watchtower magazine.  However, if you understand what they teach, you would have to say that neither apply to them as they don't follow the bible.  But for the most part they follow the old testament.  The new testament is a convenant with all of us and Jesus through Faith and Grace.  Salvation is through Jesus Christ.  However, even though it is spelled out pretty clearly in the bible, the JW's choose to ignore the new testament salvation and Grace through Faith.  They still believe that they must work for their Salvation and that Salvation is through Jehovah. God of the old Testament and through their Organization.  This is not in either testament of the bible.  During the Memorial, the only JW's that partake of the bread and wine are the spirit anointed, that are part of the 144,000. The rest are forbidden, as is written in the Watchtower rules and regulations.  For a sect that looks so forward to the kingdom of God, it's going to be known as the great disappointment of the Jehovah's Witnesses and what a fitting ending to such a great cult.|`|te9y6MQkaa	The JW's teach that it applies only to their 144,000.

Lutes, Meths, Bapts, Evos are all denominations of Christianity.<br>  <br>  Mormons (LDS) and JWs are not Christian.  They are pseudo-Christian cults.|`|AA10471679	Would you care to provide documentation for any of those assertions, or should we just use those assertions to establish who you are?<br>  ---<br>  <sigh><br>  "Tolstoyevsky" is a pseudonym created by the Soviet satirists Ilf & Petrov.<br>  Next?|`|yz6qXwUiaa	It's all just human behavior? God has nothing to do with it?  Is this what you are saying?<br>  <br>  On the contrary  Jesus told us that BY our behavior we would be recognized as God's people or not.  He said that many would say to him "Lord Lord" but that even though they did "many powerful works" in his name, that he would NOT recognize them.  This means that many claiming to be Christian are simply NOT Christian by the standard that Jesus himself set up.  He also said "by their fruits" you will recognize who is and who is not truly Christian.  He told us that a good "tree" doesn't produce "rotten fruit" and a bad tree doesn't produce "good fruit".<br>  <br>  He told his disciples that "by this all will know that you are my disciples, if you have love among yourselves".  He also told his disciples that they were to be "no part of the world".<br>  <br>  So if a Christian actually follows these commands, remains separate from the world, does not get involved in its politics, its wars, its immorality, if he has so much love for his fellow Christian that he would rather DIE than go to war and kill his fellowman (and even others of his same denomination or faith), then THIS one is actually a Christian (according to Christ's teachings).<br>  <br>  How do we know this?  Jesus said "I am giving you a new commandment" and he went on to tell us that this NEW commandment involved loving one another as he loved us.  How much did he love us?  Enough that he was willing to sacrifice his own life for us.<br>  <br>  Jehovah's Witnesses in all countries of the world refuse to fight in this world's wars.  We refuse to go to battle against our brothers to fight and kill one another.  We have endured vicious persecutions, imprisonment even death over our Christian stand.  We were incarcerated in Nazi Germany's death camps, sent to Siberia in Russia, tortured, hounded, and thrown off bridges to waiting crocodiles in Malawi, all because of our neutral stand politically.  Because of remaining "no part of this world".<br>  <br>  In Nazi Germany a sister Elsa Abt and a group of her female witness companions was accidentally sent on to another city while being transported between one concentration camp and another.  She and her friends could have easily escaped and run off.  Most people would have done exactly that.  But she and her friends took the time and the trouble to find the camp they were being sent to and to report there.<br>  <br>  The guards LAUGHED at them saying "only Jehovah's Witnesses would voluntarily come here".  Seems a foolish thing to do doesn't it?  Her reason?  "We knew that it would be harder for our sisters if we didn't show up".  Love.  Love was her reason.  Genuine love among her brother and sisterhood.  THIS is the mark of true Christianity.  It isn't about someone's underwear or how they baptize. It is how much a person LOVES and puts Jehovah first in their life.  How much they put Christ's teachings to the fore in how they deal with their fellowman.<br>  <br>  Sister Abt, later gave her small meager rations to a brother who was very ill and he told her that she saved his life.  THIS after both of these people had been through the worst of the Nazi camps.  As the German government was collapsing and the prisoners had already endured a long time.  I'm sure you've seen pictures from those camps, how skinny all of them were.  Can you imagine YOURSELF giving your last meal to someone else under such circumstances?  Those who truly love one another can.<br>  <br>  True Christianity isn't about quibbling over words.  It isn't anything near so trivial.  True Christians should be able to say that if everyone in the world lived by the standards that THEY live by that the world would be a better place.  That there would be no war, no hatred, that people would share and that all would have enough food, clothing, shelter and that in general would help and assist one another.<br>  <br>  They need to not only be able to SAY this, but they need to prove by their actions and by how they treat their brothers and sisters, even strangers, that this is true.<br>  <br>  As one of Jehovah's Witnesses I genuinely KNOW, genuinely feel, that if the whole world were Jehovah's Witness that we would have no war.  We would build a better society of people who genuinely care about others.  I've seen the evidence within my kingdom halls of people who DO offer help and love and friendship and caring and who refrain from war or fraud or any other thing that would be harming to one another.<br>  <br>  A Christian is one who follows Christ's teachings. Jehovah's Witnesses are living proof that it is possible to follow his "NEW commandment".|`|y2VcJ0t8aa	Agnostics, the atheist religion says you are on the fence and are dishonest.<br>  <br>  The Atheist Religion follows the denominations of the Rev Dawkins.

YmbMpS0caa	Let's allow the Founding Fathers to speak for themselves on this issue:<br>  <br>  “The government of the United States is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion.” - John Adams in the Treaty of Tripoli<br>  <br>  "The way to see by faith is to shut the eye of reason" - Ben Franklin<br>  <br>  "I had hoped that liberal and enlightened thought would have reconciled the Christians so that their religious fights would not endanger the peace of Society.” - George Washington<br>  <br>  "Christianity neither is, nor ever was a part of the common law." - Thomas Jefferson<br>  <br>  “Religious bondage shackles and debilitates the mind and unfits it for every noble enterprise.”  - James Madison<br>  <br>  “Lighthouses are more helpful than churches.” - Ben Franklin<br>  <br>  "Each of those churches show certain books, which they call revelation, or the word of God. The Jews say, that their word of God was given by God to Moses, face to face; the Christians say, that their word of God came by divine inspiration: and the Turks say, that their word of God (the Koran) was brought by an angel from Heaven. Each of those churches accuse the other of unbelief; and for my own part, I disbelieve them all. " - Thomas Paine<br>  <br>  “But how has it happened that millions of fables, tales, legends, have been blended with both Jewish and Christian revelation that have made them the most bloody religion that ever existed.” - John Adams<br>  <br>  “Millions of innocent men, women, and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been burned, tortured, fined, and imprisoned, yet we have not advanced one inch toward uniformity. What has been the effect of coercion? To make one half of the world fools and the other half hypocrites.” - Thomas Jefferson<br>  <br>  "The Christian religion is a parody on the worship of the Sun, in which they put a man whom they call Christ, in the place of the Sun, and pay him the same adoration which was originally paid to the Sun." - Thomas Paine<br>  <br>  Most of the Founding Fathers were deists.

zOU5fNHWaa	A dude is an individual, typically male, particularly somebody well dressed or who has never lived outside a big city. The female equivalent, which is used less often, is "dudette." However, "dude" has evolved to become more unisex to encompass both genders[3], and this was true even in the 1950s, when the word was used in its more traditional sense.[4] It can alternatively be spelled "dood."[citation needed]<br>  <br>  The word dude is an American English slang term generally used informally to address or refer to somebody and was once used primarily by adults but this has become a common slang term used in various age groups.<br>  <br>  History<br>  The term "dude" was first used in speech in 1873. It was first used in print in 1876, in Putnam's Magazine.[7]<br>  <br>  One of the earliest books to use the word was The Home and Farm Manual, written by Jonathan Periam in 1883. In that work, Periam used the term "dude" several times to denote an ill-bred and ignorant, but ostentatious, man from the city.<br>  <br>  "Dude ranches," to which wealthy Easterners came to experience the "cowboy life," began to appear in the American West in the early 20th century.<br>  <br>  It became prominent in surfer culture in the early '60s, but it wasn't until the mid-'70s that it started creeping into the mainstream. Some usages in pop culture have contributed to the spread of this word.<br>  <br>  Usage<br>  Historically, the word usually has been used as a noun describing a type of man, or as an interjection. The tone and inflection of the word "dude" are used to convey the various meanings. For example, someone may be a "surfer dude." "Dude" is considered to be slang, similar to the phrase "man."<br>  <br>  "Dude" is also used alone in a sentence as an interjection denoting a feeling of surprise, happiness, disappointment, amazement or other emotions.[5] As an interjection, a short, clipped "dude!" might be used to convey annoyance with someone, while a long, drawn-out "duuuude" conveys amazement. The word might also be used almost anywhere in a sentence in order to convey such sentiments in conversation, as in, "Listen, dude, we have to go."<br>  <br>  Other, older definitions include those of a well-dressed male, or one who is unfamiliar with life outside a large city. These definitions may go hand-in-hand, hence the phrased definition "an Easterner in the West" (United States).[6]<br>  <br>  "Dude," can also be referred to as "mate," or "bro."|`|lQR9fYGhaa	A dude is an individual, typically male, particularly somebody well dressed or who has never lived outside a big city.

The word as used in contemporary culture, typically American, may have had its origins in the Irish [3], and indeed, dúd in modern Irish is a derogatory term for a foolish person [4].<br>  <br>  The word "dude" may have also been invented by Oscar Wilde and his friends as a combination of "dud" and "attitude".[5]<br>  <br>  One example of this use is "dude ranches", ranches built in the western states of America for "dudes", or city folk to experience "cowboy life". "Dude" was also used in the 1870s by cowboys to describe a newcomer to the West.[6] Tombstone Sherriff John Slaughter was thought to be a "dude" when he first arrived in Tombstone.|`|nVh0Ut5Gaa	Well, I'm like no genious or anything like that so don't think I am.

AA10083573	No, I've never been to one formally, but I've heard of them and think they're a wonderful idea. Many of us live in a noisy world, with things pulling at us from every side. Often, we don't spend as much time with God as we'd like to. So taking the time to do so is a wonderful thing. There have been times when I'd close the door to my bedroom, get on my knees, and spend as much time as was needed talking to Him, and just being quiet. I'd open my Bible, open it and lay it on the bed. I'd page through it, looking for what God wanted to speak to me about. Sometimes He'd give me a word or a line of scripture. I'd read it, and it would be just the thing I'd need at that time. Sometimes I'd just play some quiet Vinyard music, and allow His songs to wash over me, soothing me and causing all the noises in my life to disappear. What I learned during these times, is that God would never leave me or forsake me, even when I didn't "feel" His presence. And that He always had the right words for me, just when I needed it most. He's got a way of getting to the heart of the matter, cutting through all the excuses, and shedding Light on what's really important. I always come away refreshed, and stronger in my faith. It's never a waste of time. <*)))><|`|0YQRbq9faa	Isaiah 50:10 has the answer.  There are times when believers walk through dark times; and it appears God is giving them the silent treatment.  However, that is when faith is required.  Faith in God and the reality presented in His Word is what takes you through the dark times of life.<br>  <br>  "Isaiah 50:10 Who among you fears the Lord and obeys the voice of his servant? Let him who walks in darkness and has no light, trust in the name of the Lord and rely on his God."|`|ojkKmAGCaa	Yeah.  I learned that I like silence, and I learned that God doesn't exist.|`|p1BLbINuaa	what the **** is a silent retreat?|`|bf4262c79c463ef538ce7d73ba7ea9c0aa	I learned that God is of my choosing and that I must take responsibility for what I think or in the case of the quiet retreat, dont think.
AA11440601	No.<br>  <br>  You probably would have no problem attending someone's wedding or funeral because you loved them.<br>  <br>  Love also allows you attend Mass with your partner.<br>  <br>  I think it is great that you love him so much that you are concerned for his spiritual welfare. <br>  <br>  With love in Christ.|`|AA11785060	If the guy was really religious and thought it was his duty to attend church, he'd go. That's his business anyway--- and if he ever throws in your face that he doesn't go because you aren't religious, that is all Bull-Sht.  My wife is very religious, I am atheist, she goes to church, I don't go just to make her happy.   Your comment "spiritual fulfillment is an important part of life" is either misplaced, or you really have some religious beliefs or are feeling pressured by society that religion is a requirement.  Let him live his life, and practice or not practice his religion. religion is a deeply personal thing, not something someone else should push on another person.|`|31e0283ff8bc957ec9168709f61d5bf0aa	It is even more wrong to claim you are a Catholic and disregard your obligation as such. Non-believer who attends the church may gain something from it than the believer who never takes time to consider going. You lose nothing except your time that you think you should have done something else important.|`|k5X78IM3aa	It would not be wrong for you to go to be with & to support him.  Everybody should be welcome at church...for whatever reason.<br>  <br>  I wish my husband had gone to church with me.  He was not a believer so I went alone...before I just stopped going.  Maybe we would not have gotten a divorce if we could have shared that part of our life.|`|ucuP0boCaa	I have done that with my wife.

The two of you may be able to bond during the process of answering those questions.<br>  <br>  I wish you well.|`|AA11389157	Church is just a building where people gather to discuss God.<br>  Nothing more.<br>  You won't disappear in a puff of smoke by going there,<br>  though I wouldn't recommend a Cathlic church.<br>  They are masters of deceit and illusion.|`|NrzxtivLaa	I don't see an issue with it......I've gone to church a few times at the request of my mother, as well, I'm to attend easter service with a lady friend of mine as well.......|`|Mwo1CNGRaa	No. Everyone is welcome to attend Church.<br>  It is the house of the Lord and everyone is welcome.|`|sebhK7r7aa	Maybe you could be more open-minded?

You could also limit yourself in the church, by not taking communion and the kneeling.  Im an atheist, my gf is catholic..when we go to church, i just dont take communion and kneel for prayers..coz i wont be praying.  I go to church for her...and nothing more.<br>  <br>  I sometimes listen to the homily, but at times it really is repetitive.<br>  <br>  All in all, its ok.

Therefore making a hazard to other motorists.<br>  <br>  Some bikers should also learn how to drive with caution, and not always think that someone driving a car will have to drive extra careful, just because they ride a motorcycle. Sharing the road with others is always a good thing to remember.  <br>  <br>  I also think people that pushed for the no helmet law here in FLA, is completely out of their F'N minds and are complete a'holes, but  that is just my opinion also.|`|TFdKrkP2aa	It is a very small minority. I ride all the time and kids wave, girls stare and guys always check out my bike.|`|ggQLK1Mqaa	You've gotta wonder why a non-biker is taking the time to go to a biker forum just to post stupid sh*t like that.  The motivations of that sort of person aren't really worth worrying about, because they're probably illogical and silly and the product of various unrelated stresses or pent-up rage anyway.<br>  <br>  For my part, I have no problem with bikers; I will note that it can be frustrating to drive around bikers on the road because of the worry that, if there's an accident, you could end up doing major or even lethal damage so you have to be extra-cautious.  As a very aggressive driver, this is a thorn in my side.  But, I have no issues with bikers in general, and don't really see why anybody would.|`|0s0oVnngaa	I ride my bike to.

She taught this child who humbled himself to be born. He already knew everything but, He let Her teach Him anyway.

I had crutches and had to wear a cast. <br>  <br>  I was still getting used to using the crutches when in my science class, I had to go out in the hall while the class corrected a test I missed. I guess I was either making too much noise or taking too long because the teacher TOOK AWAY my crutches! He made me hobble out in the hall on my cast! I wanted to punch him.

Usually, I was teacher's pet in most my classes but then I would come across a teacher who just really rubbed me the wrong way.  My algebra teacher in junior high insisted on calling me by the wrong name.  My name is Monika, pronounced like Monica.  She always pronounced my name like Moe-ni-ka with the stress on the middle syllabal.  Drove me absolutely crazy.  I would tell her how to say my name on a daily basis to no avail, I mean NO avail.  So, finally I stopped answering her and then we got into it and she threatened to call my mother and I told her, Good, call my mom and make sure you tell her that this entire year you have refused to call me by name.<br>  <br>  At my high school, my algebra 2 teacher was a stickler for correct English which she should be.  But, you get a bunch of black 16 year olds together and, I'm sorry, the ebonics will flow!   LOL!  So, somebody asked this boy, Keith, to give him some paper.  Keith said, man, I ain't got no paper!  My teacher said, "Ain't got no?  Students, we aren't going to talk like slaves in here!"  LMAO!  We all hit the floor, oh my God.  So that wasn't really annoying but it was too, too funny!|`|IsxB0Qi7aa	This one substitute teacher was calling role & was starting out with Mister or Miss before our names & I guess he thought my name was a boy name because he called me Mister Ronice in front of the whole class & they started laughing so hard, I hated my name for the longest time so I would go by nicknames like Roni or Neicey which sounded more like a girl's name.

HoYvAueuaa	Laughter is vital to happiness in my opinion. If people never laugh then how happy can they be. If I were surrounded by seriousness then I would try to get people to laugh as best I can if it were appropriate to do so. I wouldn't laugh while a house was on fire but I would make a joke about someone at a funeral to make people remember the good times. Can't always be serious.

I prefer a masculine body/features/physique, but a bit more of a feminine mentality.  I love emotional and sensitive guys.

Everyone goes through life looking for something, even if that something is nothing (as in atheist). Believing is of the moment. I recall as a child as my mother was "saved" as I was holding onto her in tears because at that time I was a "true believer." As I grew older, a lot of questions and conflict came to pass, and I saw the world around me much differently. I am now comfortable with my "non-belief."<br>  <br>  From your perspective, you serve what you believe in. I admire that and support you 100%. Conversely, I do not believe in a deity, so to that end I cannot walk away from what I do not believe exists.<br>  <br>  So that you know, I was in the Baptist Church until I was 15, Catholic til Viet Nam, and atheist since. I do not go around antagonizing Christians, Jews, Muslims, et al because if there is one thing I DO believe in is that your right to believe as you do gives me my right to do the same and vice-versa.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|ccf1380d8076cbe37300f50ef722bbf2aa	Yes, you can walk away from an imaginary creature. <br>  <br>  Your logic is as good as "Can you be an Ex-Santarian?

If you follow that logic, it would be true of any religion's God.  In addition, you can't say that there is not evidence that God is real.

I'm pretty sure nothing short of a similar experience would ever convince you.  But it did happen.  You have the scriptures and the witness of millions of Christians.  You can see God's hand in the universe.  These sure didn't convince me, and I suspect we are alike in that.  But you've overstepped in this question.  Some of us have been given proof.  Now I've shared it with you.  It's not even a matter of faith for me.  I know God exists.

You are a physical being.I am like as you are.If you show kindness it is invisble in quality till you apply it. If you show unkindness,it is invisible untill you apply it. One is good and one is evil. These are spiritual qualities. What more proof do you need? That is spiritual becoming present.becoming tangible.<br>  This is one way the spiritual force works through the faithful..This is also how evil becomes present and tangible too. The soul is the temple of these invisible qualities and so what we embrace in our heart we apply in our lives and is what we are,- good or maybe evil or both. This is proof of the spiritual forces. It is from the heart of the soul that we do God's work through us who believe and we who believe should do the will of God.<br>  You have heard of the spiritual war in the heavens.Well the Kingdom of God is within you,or if you like, the Kingdom of Heaven. I believe too the Kingdom of Hell dwells within your soul,if God is not with you ,in you. That is the truth of the proof you ask of me. this is what Christ tried to teach his people in Israel,is what i believe. Christ did not create the christian church's per say.The christian church created its self. Christ said to those with him,those who followed,go and teach what i have taught you,and so much did Christ teach about the nature of God and the nature of the heart  and it is the nature of the heart,in each of us that really matters for how else does the Holy Spirit work if not through us? The heart is the true temple of God. i hope this makes some sense to you. <>UMIE|`|Mwo1CNGRaa	NO. <br>  Can you disprove him? No.<br>  <br>  <br>  -What is faith like?<br>  <br>  Faith means believing in and obeying God, which requires relying on what we cannot see---God's promises, provisions and concern for us. An inner attitude alone does not define faith, though. For faith to be present, action is required. Faith proves itself by obedience to the Lord.<br>  The writer of Hebrews expressed faith in two directions: faith toward future things (what we hope for) and faith toward invisible things (what we do not see). When we are certain God is in control of these areas (and we live like he is in control), that's faith.<br>  The two sides of faith---assurance and expectation---can be seen in the lives of those listed in this chapter. They had strong convictions about unseen present realities. They also had a strong assurance that God's promises would be fulfilled---even in the face of evidence that seemed to suggest otherwise (see, for example Hebrews 11:11).<br>  Ultimately, the way we see God will determine the shape of our faith. If we see a big, faithful, all-powerful God, then our faith will rise to those levels. <br>  If, on the other hand, we see a smaller God, a distant or less active God, then faith will plateau at those levels.|`|b32jC7pGaa	There is absolutely no credible, tangible, verifiable, or irrefutable evidence that would support the existence of any 'god'.

Saying something like "Are your memories real?" is abstract and meaningless. You could have hypothetically been transplanted here today, and all your memories implanted by aliens. However, there is proof of memory. To this day, there is no direct proof of God, except for a mysterious book. There is evidence of evolution: fossils, analogous structures, genetic similarities, etc... There is evidence of the Big Bang: the singularity, reverse expansion, M-Brane particle expansion, etc...

You might not be ashamed to acknowledge a cute baby per say. You may be affectionate w/ guys(i.e. not afraid to have a guys arm around your shoulder, this has nothing to do w/ sex people lol). OR JUST MAYBE, comfort a girl during her downtime. Give her a shoulder to cry on and show compassion w/ her.<br>  <br>  If you are artistic-you might embrace it by going to art museums and not be afraid to admit that you like some music by female singers. <br>  <br>  If you care about your appearance-maybe you might not be afraid to use scented lotions or really creamy lotions. Or baby oil(omg, that will make your skin ooh so soft).

jcL7gDMKaa	Yes its a brilliant charity. I work as a volunteer for a Barnado's Bookshop in Scotland. We raise money that helps kids who are homeless or cannot stay at home because of family problems. There is a unit in my town where the kids can go to gain refuge from their current situations (be it, parents who are drug abusers, or violent drunks) these kids can be assured of safety when they go to these units. They can be around other kids in similar situations and watch dvds and do things that kids are meant to do, instead of having to tolerate problems that are caused by adults and are not in any way their fault.|`|T2C6hqaAaa	Yes, they're a good one.

Theologians have ascribed a variety of attributes to the many different conceptions of God. The most common among these include omniscience, omnipotence, omnipresence, omnibenevolence (perfect goodness), divine simplicity, and eternal and necessary existence. God has also been conceived as being incorporeal, a personal being, the source of all moral obligation, and the "greatest conceivable existent". These attributes were all supported to varying degrees by the early Jewish, Christian and Muslim theologian philosophers, including Maimonides, Augustine of Hippo, and Al-Ghazali, respectively. Many notable medieval philosophers developed arguments for the existence of God, attempting to wrestle with the apparent contradictions implied by many of these attributes.|`|hQDapmICaa	YES! in your mind, you belief and think that God is NOT real.

Let me ask you a question.  Would you respect or even be afraid of a person who, for a punishment for everything that their child ever did was to put their hand in the fire?  I wouldn't respect that person a bit and I would be afraid that they would do that to my children if they got the chance.

I think thats one of the reasons you see other countrys celebrating it more than we do. We live here, and we are irish and therefore we just dont appreciate our country as much as the others.

FR5gJLseaa	the rapture thing isn't what caught my eye, the 2012 statement did. what a beautiful question! of course the world is doomed, but who are we, to give ourselves an expiration date! sure, religion and cultures all have their idea on this because for some cultures, their calender ends at 2012 but how do they know whoever made it wasn't just lazy huh? anyways don't stress out about that assumtion of our end because if it happens it happens. we aren't going to be here aafter it does to say "i told you so" so quit bringing it up and keep moving. were all dying anyways, slowly but surely!|`|qjdX24Rbaa	I don't see how people don't want to believe that they are being taken care of, that all they have to be is a better person.

This is when the believers will be lifted up;  the tribulation times.  I am ready to be raptured for that is the end of times and not sure if its 2012 for no one knows the end of time so whoever believes the concept (seen in the history channel where the Aztecs developed a calender and if read the major effects on earth are in deed marked, the end---2012 was not inscribed on this calender therefore many--explorers believe it shows the end of earth) so I 'll just be ready and stay pure, and ready for His return.

Many people misinterpret this. according to the Mayans, Aztec, and even I Ching, the world as we know it will end in 2012. That is to say that many changes huge changes will happen that will remake the world into something much different. <br>  <br>  This could be earthquakes, volcanic activity, massive hurricanes, all of which science is pointing to; or political, which could mean the abolition of the union (USA) due to the insanity that our current president and his cronies are involved in, nuclear war (if Iran gets its hand on them it has stated that it will use them to destroy Israel), or all life being wiped out by a rouge comet. <br>  <br>  This could mean a great many things but it gives no real answer.

It can't because I am still here. First the rapture has to occur, second, there will be seven years of tribulation here on earth after the rapture and third, after the tribulation period, God will come back to earth with his bride to rule and reign, and to reign with the tribulations saints for one thousand years. After the thousand years he will have this great war with satan and his people and he will cast satan, the false prophet, the beast and all unbelievers into the lake of fire, and then he will burn up the Heavens and the Earth, this will be the end of this world. Then there will be a new Heaven and a new Earth.

If the rapture took place today and the seven year tribulation period started tomorrow, that would put us at 2016 at least.|`|E9chZY74aa	The word "rapture" was coined by a man who wrote "The Late Great Planet Earth" and picked and chose things that were not meant for the end of times.<br>  When Christ comes again, there will be a loud trumpet or shout, an angel with a flaming sword will come to take vengeance on those who refuse God as Lord and we will rise to meet Christ in the air, all who have had our past sins washed away in baptism and are living a life of worship toward God.  All the earth and everything physical will be burned and eternity will yawn before us. On that day, Judgment Day, God will separate Good from Evil forevermore.  No one knows what day and certainly not 2012 for certain.  Man has always though that he knows, but no man knows.|`|aZUszuqLaa	Oh it's such a positive word.  I believe it means exactly how the dictionary defines it:  Rapture:  An experience when the Spirit is exalted to a knowledge of Divine things.  It will be the beginning of the "Golden  Age."   A state of bliss that will occur where we will be "changed."  The world will only end AS WE NOW KNOW IT.

But we are not an independent country either. We are... something weird. More commonly known as a colony.<br>  Right now we are ruled by something called "Estado Libre Asociado" (ELA) which literally translates to "Free Associated State". That's what the politicians say, but if you analyze it, its not true. We are not Free. We are not a State. And to be Associated with anything, we have to be at the same level, which we are not. Therefore, its just a silly title to keep people happy. <br>  If you make research, PR is the ONLY COLONY LEFT IN THE WORLD. The UN has pointed this out, and has been harassing the US for years to resolve PR's status. Either they make us a state, or they give us our independence. Obviously, we have received neither. The only reason PR is in the economical status that its in right now, is because we are only allowed to export to the US, so we can't make business with the rest of the world. But even so, we still don't get all the benefits official states get, so to keep us on bay, they let us participate in american things like american idol :P <br>  In general, we are just something weird that's not one thing or the other. So we technically are americans, but we officially aren't. I hope this answered your question ^_^ sorry if I went on ranting and said unnecessary stuff ^_^;;|`|39yiT45vaa	I saw that too!

The drop in temperature will be more than offset by the Sun expanding until it's diameter is at least 100 times what it is now. Even before the the Sun expands into a red giant, Earth will be a dead planet because as the hydrogen in the core is depleted, the core contracts and gets hotter. In 500 million years, the Earth will start to heat up and a runaway greenhouse effect will start eventually. The increasing heat will drive the water into the upper atmosphere, where UV radiation destroys it. Carbon dioxide will build up, and the oceans boil away. Earth will then be like Venus, a Hellish place with hot enough to melt lead and a crushing carbon dioxide atmosphere full of acids and toxic gases. When the Sun does start expanding into a red giant, the increasing heat will drive off the Earth's atmosphere into space, and the surface of the planet will turn into a sea of lava. As the sun passes through the red giant stage, it will lose huge amounts of it's material and the planet will spiral away from the Sun, which will fill the sky. The helium fusion starts and the outer envelope shrinks, and the luminosity drops. The Earth will not benefit much because the surface temperature will still be a blistering 1,300 degrees or more. After a couple of billion years, the Sun will expand again, and may swallow up the Earth, which will spiral into the Sun's interior and vaporize. If not, the Sun will pulsate and then cast off it's outer layers, leaving a dead core of carbon and oxygen that will fall inwards until it's electrons stop the Sun from collapsing any further. The outer layers will become a planetary nebula, the tiny but still very hot core will become a white dwarf hundreds of times fainter than the Sun is today. If the Earth is still around, it will freeze up and become a dead, cold ball of fused rock and metal. We will be extinct well before the Sun becomes a red giant, because if we don't leave the planet, the relentless increase in energy output will destabilize water here and kill off all life.|`|dR9UyP6naa	Pretty much like it is now.

and what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?<br>  <br>  4And Jesus answered and said unto them, Take heed that no man deceive you.<br>  <br>  5For many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.<br>  <br>  6And ye shall hear of wars and rumours of wars: see that ye be not troubled: for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet.<br>  <br>  7For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom: and there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.<br>  <br>  8All these are the beginning of sorrows.<br>  <br>  9Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.<br>  <br>  10And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.<br>  <br>  11And many false prophets shall rise, and shall deceive many.<br>  <br>  12And because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.<br>  <br>  13But he that shall endure unto the end, the same shall be saved.<br>  <br>  14And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall the end come.<br>  <br>  15When ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation, spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place, (whoso readeth, let him understand:)<br>  <br>  16Then let them which be in Judaea flee into the mountains:<br>  <br>  17Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:<br>  <br>  18Neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes.<br>  <br>  19And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days!<br>  <br>  20But pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, neither on the sabbath day:<br>  <br>  21For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.<br>  <br>  22And except those days should be shortened, there should no flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened.<br>  <br>  23Then if any man shall say unto you, Lo, here is Christ, or there; believe it not.<br>  <br>  24For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall shew great signs and wonders; insomuch that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.<br>  <br>  25Behold, I have told you before.<br>  <br>  26Wherefore if they shall say unto you, Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not.<br>  <br>  27For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.<br>  <br>  28For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the eagles be gathered together.<br>  <br>  29Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:<br>  <br>  30And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.<br>  <br>  31And he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.<br>  <br>  32Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer is nigh:<br>  <br>  33So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.<br>  <br>  34Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.<br>  <br>  35Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.<br>  <br>  36But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.<br>  <br>  37But as the days of Noah were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.<br>  <br>  38For as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in ma|`|7422ddf097669bd7b6e3d48e56258b87aa	<a href="http://www.askmeaboutgod.org/passionfinawebl/Passionndx187.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.askmeaboutgod.org/passionfina...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://askmeaboutgod.org/antichrist.html" rel="nofollow">http://askmeaboutgod.org/antichrist.html</a>|`|F4R4RJVcaa	for saved people wonderful for unsaved people hell|`|WsQ8Ua1zaa	idk, something cool, like a black hole|`|K7qVTt7raa	There are many books in the Bible about prophecy.

You can NOT become better ONLY in one area e.g. speaking, you MUST improve your skills in ALL dimensions of the language!<br>  <br>  Learning language well requires being as active as possible and making the learning fun for yourself. Taking lessons is always important, but equally important are these:<br>  <br>  1) Listen/watch: Listen to internet radio stations like BBC, watch TV shows in English (use only subtitles, NOT voice dubbing!), etc.<br>  <br>  2) Write/communicate: Try to find discussion forums from the web about things that you find interesting (music/various artists, hobbies, etc.) and start communicating there with other people using English. Start using instant messaging systems in case you find some new friends or start emailing them.<br>  <br>  3) Buy yourself a proper dictionary, and each time when you see a strange word that you do not understand, look it up.<br>  <br>  The main point in ANY language learning is to make it as fun as possible for yourself. Try to find topics that interest you, read online newspapers, listen to BBC/NBC and other radio stations online, if you find a discussion forum for e.g. your favourite hobby or your idols in music do participate there, etc. <br>  <br>  I'm sorry there is no easy way out with this, you must develop your skills in ALL these language "levels" or dimensions in order to reach better language skills!! <br>  <br>  Last but not least: NEVER EVER use ANY online translators, they are nothing but utter rubbish!! English is practically EVERYWHERE these days, especially on the internet, so you just have to use your imagination to find it!<br>  <br>  Good luck!
AA11220299	First the word Jew comes from the word Judah, as does Judea. Jesus was of the tribe of Judah so He is Jewish.

FLAtdWrmaa	I wish I could remember the ad, but the message in it kind of applies to your case:  it's on the National Geographic channel, and it's a list-with-"visual aids" of the time that average people spend in their whole lives doing various things:  9 years looking for the remote control, time spent brushing teeth, sleeping, waiting in lines, etc.  There's one pair of stats that say that we have an average of 20-something good friends (I think) when we're 16, but by the time we're 40, the number of good friends drops to 2.<br>  <br>  You may get down to your 2 best friends a little earlier than the average.<br>  <br>  Obviously, some of your problem has to be how these friends perceive you, what the part is that they want you to have in their lives.  They're not writing you out completely, so each of them must see something in you that they value.  It's just not as large and wide a value as *you* wish they had.<br>  <br>  Don't knock the fact that people come to you because they know you will listen.  This sort of relationship is actually an honor for you, something you can be proud of, in a quiet way.  Clearly, your friends like knowing that *they* have someone who will listen to them -- good listeners are few and far between, and some of us out here in the real world never do find a good heart who will be that for us, in any relationship.<br>  <br>  There are degrees of friendship and lesser friendly relationships, from "lifelong best, best friends" all the way to "friendly acquaintances" and "friendly neighbors."  I doubt any of us, you included, could actually manage to have 50 best-best friends -- it'd be just too exhausting!  And you'd never have time for family, romance, work, school, or anything else life offers.<br>  <br>  The fakery would be in either you or they expecting that many people to treat you as a best friend when none of you really, sincerely are.<br>  <br>  So, value the real friendships you have, and I hope that all of them are durable friendships, too.<br>  <br>  And on to what I suspect is the real problem for you:  You have a large group of good-enough but casual friends with whom you'd like to socialize more, but they aren't responding:  they're leaving you out of their social plans, possibly quite deliberately.  I doubt the deliberateness would be everyone, btw, but it only takes a couple of people setting the tone for the "guest list" for each occasion to curtail your chances of inclusion.<br>  <br>  So you need to mentally review what you know and like-and-dislike about each of the individuals in this larger group.  Write it down if that helps you organize your thinking, but don't keep any paper like that -- burn it as soon as you're feeling organized.  What you're looking for is 2 to 5 trustworthy people in this group who you might broach with a question or two about being included in some of these get-togethers, if they come to talk to you one-on-one sometime, or who you can contact for a one-on-one chat.<br>  <br>  I don't know your age or other social circumstances, so I can't make too many suggestions.  But you can consider finding out if people generally have a problem with you in large groups -- maybe you're just naturally more likeable in small gatherings.  Maybe you "get lost" in large groups because you're very quiet, or shy, or just don't contribute enough conversationally -- so people organizing happenings simply and honestly forget about you.  Maybe the opposite is the case, maybe you dominate too much at gatherings, without tuning in to the wishes of people around you -- so you get left out, maybe more than anyone meant to, but they haven't noticed yet. These are personal characteristics that are only problems in a few specific situations.  You can always work to improve your sociability, but it's important that you only do such work as a way of growing, not as a way of trying to mold your personality to the shape others design for you.<br>  <br>  Have you seriously offended someone in the group, or several someones?  Maybe this is being held against you.  In which case, you may or may not have much chance of making amends.  You'd have to decide how much effort you want to put into trying to mend matters with the offended one(s), and then letting the rest of the group know that all is now well.<br>  <br>  Have you had disagreements or personal problems with anyone in the group?  That may be affecting how much they all want to see you and this other person at the same time.  Meetings between ex-girlfriends & boyfriends are a classic situation, but rivals in sports, jobs, romance, or academics might also face this.  And social groups commonly take sides, gradually pushing out the less-favored friend, or sometimes dividing between the two, splitting into two new & smaller circles of friends.<br>  <br>  There could even be a situation where one or more members of the larger group is a nasty piece of work and has decided, for whatever reason (including random, vengeful, irrational, or bored-and-vicious reasons) to make a social target of you.  You could be the subject o|`|aHlpWFVhaa	I know how you feel, that's just how some of these <br>  young kids are.<br>  <br>  That's why when i was in High School [I'm 19] i had a lot <br>  of associates and was really popular, but i only made <br>  1 VERY good REAL friend out of them all and we still are <br>  tight today.

D4jZM26Paa	Khmer.|`|jfcrxSSBaa	I would probably say the Thai alphabet.  Here are some details about it:<br>  <br>  - This is a syllabic alphabet consisting of 44 basic consonants, each with an inherent vowel: [o] in medial position and [a] in final position. The [a] is usually found in words of Sanskrit, Pali or Khmer origin while the [o] is found native Thai words. The 18 other vowels and 6 diphthongs are indicated using diacritics which appear in front of, above, below of after the consonants they modify. <br>  8 of the letters are used only for writing words of Pali and Sanskrit origin. <br>  <br>  - For some consonants there are multiple letters. Originally they represented separate sounds, but over the years the distinction between those sounds was lost and the letters were used instead to indicate tones. <br>  <br>  - Thai is a tonal language with 5 tones. The tone of a syllable is determined by a combination of the class of consonant, the type of syllable (open or closed), the tone marker and the length of the vowel. <br>  <br>  - There are no spaces between words, instead spaces in a Thai text indicate the end of a clause or sentence. <br>  <br>  Here are examples of what the alphabet looks like:<br>  <a href="http://www.omniglot.com/writing/thai.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.omniglot.com/writing/thai.htm</a><br>  <a href="http://th.yahoo.com/">http://th.yahoo.com/</a><br>  <br>  A close second might be Burmese: <a href="http://www.omniglot.com/writing/burmese.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.omniglot.com/writing/burmese....</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_language" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burmese_lan...</a><br>  <br>  Chinese, both traditional and simplified, and Japanese are very complex, but they follow a definite system, using its radicals, and japanese kanji can be converted to kana or romanji if needed.<br>  <br>  Arabic, despite what people say, is actually not that difficult to learn.

Even within the same sound, there are 4 different tones. So this means that for a word in 4 different tones, you will have to learn at least over 20 ways of writing the characters, of each represents a different meaning. <br>  <br>  Well, interestingly, not forgetting that each character comprises of many strokes. If you miss any stroke, the word is considered as written wrongly!|`|RoLcpujNaa	chinese is not hard to write when u understand the basic<br>  the symbols they use are repetitive <br>  symbols with synonymous meaning contain the same parts <br>  木 - tree<br>  林- wood<br>  媾 - this one means marriage, 女(female)<br>  遘 - this one means meet unexpectedly <br>  道- dao (way) has the same beginning  <br>  逃- to run (away)<br>  <br>  and hebrew writing is very simple - it took me a few months to read newspapers - arabic is a little harder for me but not fatal<br>  for me the hardest is russian, i am still making MANY grammatical errors :(<br>  despite the fact that i read more than a hundred books in russian<br>  <br>  and korean symbols look all the same to me - but i never actually tried to learn it<br>  <br>  as for websites - behold the power of Wikipedia!<br>  if you type in the search bar <br>  "X* language writing system" <br>  you'll got many examples<br>  <br>  to Wikipedia --> <a href="http://wikipedia.org/" rel="nofollow">http://wikipedia.org/</a><br>  <br>  X = instead X put a language you want to look up|`|X3TH21Mvaa	I think it's Thai <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thai-language.com/character_styles/THAI8.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.thai-language.com/character_s...</a><br>  <br>  and Arabic<br>  <br>  <a href="http://scripts.sil.org/cms/sites/nrsi/media/ABSsample_LateefReg.png" rel="nofollow">http://scripts.sil.org/cms/sites/nrsi/me...</a><br>  <br>  Gosh I can hardly distinguish the those symbols (characters).|`|P5AgKF9Yaa	hebrew|`|015UIOXlaa	It's got to be Chinese.  There are just so many characters, and the characters are so complicated!  To read a newspaper you need to be able to recognise over 3000 characters.  Even that is probably not really enough.  Chinese proficiency tests expect up to 7000 or 9000 characters worth of knowledge at the highest level.  Compared to 26 English letters and a similarish number in other languages such as Russian and Thai it's not even close. <br>  <br>  So lets go back to the complexity of the characters.  For each of those 3000 you need to learn to write, you need to write them correctly.  They can be made up of between 1 and over 20 strokes, and each stroke has to be in the right place, and ideally all the strokes should be in the right order.  Basically, learning to write Chinese is nightmarishly difficult.  But don't just take my word for it ...<br>  <br>  China exported their writing system to lots of countries, such as Vietnam, Korea and Japan.  However if you go to any of those countries today you'll find that they have all dropped Chinese characters in their writing system either entirely or partly, because it's considered too difficult to learn.  For example I was in Korea recently, and discovered that the King of Korea, at least a few hundred years ago, replaced the existing Chinese based writing system with one essentially of his own invention.  The reason being that the difficulty in learning to write (and read) Chinese was a hindrance to the educational and economic development of his people, because the ability to read and write afforded too much privilege to the few who were lucky enough to have access to such a high level of education (for those times).  The Vietnamese have a similar story, although I think they replaced the Chinese system much more recently.  As for Japan I'm not really sure but I think they have a mixture of the Chinese and their own writing system for everyday use.  I'm pretty sure they don't have anywhere near as many individual characters though.|`|pBfIG6Rxaa	hebrew?<br>  I have jewish friends, they read and speak hebrew and i have seen them write it and it is VERY complicated and intricate.

The term "shoobie" originated in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s, and it allegedly derives from the habit among tourists of bringing everything they needed in a shoe box, or because the train companies offered pre-packed lunches that came in shoe boxes."|`|r9yowD2Iaa	I think it's a clear shoe box.

I find this hard to believe.  I was in a situation a few years ago where I had to leave my husband.  I encountered nothing but a loving, caring attitude and support from the elders.  The congregation also supported me and it was not a traumatic endeavor to do what was right.  <br>  Unless you live with her and have seen, first hand, what took place then all you have is hearsay.   There 3 sides to each story, his, hers, and the truth. <br>  Your knowledge of us is tainted.  Elders do not scream, nor do they take anyone outside and scream.  They don't counsel us except in private with scripture.  In other words, if one has reason to go to the police then that is their business.  <br>  You are judging the elders as corrupt on the word of this person.  If she was truly a sister then she would have never gone to another man, let alone moved in.  That right there speaks a lot about her spiritual state.  <br>  You may be stating the facts, but I highly doubt this woman was a sister or that she felt what she did was wrong.|`|15017428de404442efe6fff34a4dd6edaa	What you are describing is exactly what happened to my mum.

You didn't say whether her husband was a professing JW or not - that would have a bearing on matters, for if he is a baptised JW, the elders would want to keep the wraps on any wife-beating. If he is not a JW, the elders would want to bend over backwards to keep lines of communication open with him, in order to win him round to becoming a JW. It's a no-win situation for the poor woman. Yet if her husband was deemed to be "a spiritual threat" to her, the self-same elders would be very keen for her to separate from him. If he objected to JW doctrine, or tried to get his JW wife to take on board non-JW ideas, worship, the wife would get 100% support from the elders to leave him.|`|CyFLDrgQaa	Im also confused about what a Jehovahs Witness is?<br>  Im a Christian and stuff..<br>  but this sound terrible.

God views marriage as a serious life long commitment. <br>  <br>  The Bible says the the only way you can have a divorce and get remarried is on the grounds of fornication. Matt 19:9<br>  <br>  <br>  However, there are extreme circumstances where a marriage does not work. One is abuse. Gal.5:20 A person can get disfellowshiped for such conduct. <br>  <br>  I know THREE cases in different cong. in different states where the husband beat up his wife and the wife divorced him with no consequences on the elders part. My grandpa (elder) was one of the ones who encouraged her to leave and helped get that jerk booted from the cong.  <br>  <br>  We are also admonished to go to the police if this occurs or if a fellow christian does commit rape etc <br>  <br>  That was the second case the husband was abusive and molested his adoptive daughter. He got arrested. They got divorced and he got disfellowshipped as well. However, she KNEW his temper BEFORE they got married. But he still got what he deserved.<br>  <br>  Yes JW aren't perfect they're are bad people in ANY religion or group of people. But they do get taken care of. I'm sorry our fellow sister is suffering. But we don't know the full story of what really happened either. <br>  <br>  And then again maybe you're right the elders are corrupt I've seen that to the Bible says that there will be wolves in the flock that won't treat them with tenderness Acts 20:29.<br>  <br>  That's what happened in the third case (these are all between my grandpa's, my folks, and my cong.). She was abused and told to work it out (1Cor 7:11) and she divorced him anyway. They gave her a hard time but she stuck it out and went to meetings and moved in with her folks so she wouldn't be tempted by another guy. She waited 5 YEARS he slipped up that jerk has also been taken care of. But she did things in the proper order and she didn't stop going to meetings or studying and she took temptation away from her by staying with her parents. (eventually those elders did get replaced)<br>  <br>  Trust me if my hubby EVER hit me it's over. There is the Bible based info from our Society that backs an abused spouse.<br>  <br>  We do take care of our own even if it means replacing an elder, disfellowshipping, or taking someone in. It does get done.<br>  <br>  Ps. If she was a sister I'm sure there was someone else she could have moved in with than another guy. This confused me.|`|AA10589243	First off , what a load of rubbish many of these answers are.<br>  <br>  Secondly ..Jehovah Witnesses do NOT hide crimes, of ANY sort.<br>  <br>  Thirdly...If a woman , any woman , is being beaten she can leave her husband if she wants to.<br>  <br>  Jehovah's Witnesses have written MANY articles in their publicly available magazines about spousal abuse , and nowhere is there found any recommendation for a victimized partner to put up with and take beatings.<br>  <br>  ANYONE that says otherwise is simply a lier.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Bible says this to husbands.<br>  <br>  1 Peter 3:7.?.?.''YOU husbands, continue dwelling in like manner with them according to knowledge, assigning them honor as to a weaker vessel, the feminine one, since YOU are also heirs with them of the undeserved favor of life, in order for YOUR prayers not to be hindered.''<br>  <br>  But , of course some men are not interested in following the Biblical way of life.<br>  <br>  <br>  As marriage is a bonding union between a man and a woman before God it is not something that is recommended to break.<br>  <br>  Matthew 19:5-6 .?.?.‘For this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and will stick to his wife, and the two will be one flesh’? ?So that they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has yoked together let no man put apart..?.---''?.<br>  <br>  The Bible says that the only reason acceptable for divorce is on the grounds of fornication.<br>  <br>  Matthew 19:8-9 .?.?''He said to them: “Moses, out of regard for YOUR hardheartedness, made the concession to YOU of divorcing YOUR wives, but such has not been the case from [the] beginning. ?I say to YOU that whoever divorces his wife, except on the ground of fornication, and marries another commits adultery.?.?.--''<br>  <br>  <br>  This being the case ,, you will NEVER find the Jehovah's Witness elders recommending divorce EVEN for spousal abuse.<br>  <br>  Doing otherwise would be against what the Bible says is the right course.<br>  <br>  <br>  'Separation' , is a possibility under such a case , but again , the elders will NOT recommend such a course of action.<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 7:10-11.?.?''.To the married people I give instructions, yet not I but the Lord, that a wife should not depart from her husband; ?but if she should actually depart, let her remain unmarried or else make up again with her husband; and a husband should not leave his wife.''<br>  <br>  <br>  So the goal even when separated , is that both work through their problems and get back together.<br>  <br>  If however things are EXTREME and perhaps a life or death situation exists for the victim , they may chose to remain away until a later time.<br>  <br>  <br>  Marriage was made to be a permanent bond , and all those thinking about separation or divorce should consider matters very seriously before acting.<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 7:39-- .?.?.''A wife is bound during all the time her husband is alive. .?.?.''<br>  <br>  <br>  Jehovah's Witness elders may be very simpathetic to the innocent parties problems , but they often UNABLE in many cases to offer suggestions to a course of action that may go against Bible teachings.<br>  <br>  Ultimately it up to the individuals involved to make good and balanced decisions in their lives.<br>  <br>  <br>  For more Bible based info please feel free to email me.|`|BzrUWCsDaa	Because I've noticed that you've asked anti-Jehovah's Witness questions before with a view to incite negativity toward us I can only assume that your question is a work of fiction.<br>  <br>  If you are a religious person or a believer in the scriptures maybe you should read the following verse & reflect upon it...<br>  <br>  Proverbs 3:32 - "For the devious are an abomination to the LORD; But He is intimate with the upright" NASB<br>  <br>  And for further research - Proverbs 6:16-19|`|EsvJ9ji3aa	Please don't just a whole religion on the way a group of imperfect men (even though they are elders it doesn't mean they are perfect this is something that we are taught to remember) I don't know the details from both sides so I can't judge but from what you said I would say I don't agree with the way the are handleing it. We recently had an awake on domestic abuse and it was wonderful. If what is said is exactly the situation them I feel bad for her and I hope Jehovah works things out. As far as moving in with another man, the odds that nothing has happened are slim to none, as a JW she should no better than that. I'm sure there was someone else she could move in with, family maybe,  or you and your family. Plenty of other JW would have taken her in. I'm sorry she is going through this and I hope it works out.

It should be rubbish that they would not take any notice of you because you are not a witness.<br>  <br>  If this elder really did do this, then it is disgraceful and it should be made known.<br>  <br>  I recently met a sister who said that she had been in a similar situation as your friend.

They say God hates it.|`|g8EViy1Raa	Stuff the elders - if her husband has beaten her she should have him prosecuted.|`|GPU4YLraaa	I know I'll just get ignored, or others will chime in telling me I don't know what I'm talking about, but none of the claims I've seen here accurately represent what the witnesses would do in real life - in your imaginations or delusions, maybe, but not in real life.<br>  <br>  If her husband is just a jerk, the elders won't likely tell her to do anything but keep trying to be a good wife.  However, IF AT ANY TIME SHE IS PHYSICALLY THREATENED, SHE WILL BE ENCOURAGED TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT.  This is especially true if he has gone so far as to abuse or assault her.<br>  <br>  My wife had a best friend in school, a mutual acquaintance.  This happened to her mom, and the only reason the elders could not do anything is because SHE refused to press charges.  When she finally did, it had been to long for any legal action to be taken (a fault of the statute of limitations, not any one person).  Even so, she was supported the whole way.<br>  <br>  Another friend of my wife had this happen to him, though none of his family was witnesses.  The elders were the ones to tell his father that THEY would be pressing charges if the boy didn't.<br>  <br>  If there's evidence of abuse, the elders will take action.  If there isn't, then there's nothing anyone - elder or otherwise - could do about it anyway.<br>  <br>  So from experience I know that:<br>  <br>  1. You're lying,<br>  2. You're contacts are lying, or<br>  3. There's not enough evidence for legal action to be taken.<br>  <br>  If you believe there is enough evidence, then take some initiative and talk to the police yourself.  This guy is not immune to the law because he professes to be a witness (he has the wrong impression of what that entails, if this is what he espouses).  No real witness is going to lie for this guy.  Don't sit around here asking for advice.<br>  <br>  Edit:  So, by your own admission, SHE is the one not going to the police.  How, then, can you blame the elders?  Or any other person on the face of the planet for that matter?<br>  <br>  And I'll concede one final possibility: You don't have all the information you need to make a completely informed decision.  Have YOU spoken to the elders to see if what you've heard is correct?  I'd wager the answer is 'no'.  That's not meant to hurt; just realise that you don't have all sides to the story.<br>  <br>  Like I said, if there's proof, the elders will support her 100%.  If there isn't, or if she's not willing to do anything about it on HER end, no one - not even the elders - can help her.  The only thing you can do is try to convince her to go to the cops.  You'll see then (if she does) who's backing who.

UO3i8BqVaa	The real question is ... <br>  WHY would a perfect 'god', in need of no thing, create anything?<br>  ~|`|Zgs4RncIaa	God has always existed<br>  <br>  God created us and earth<br>  <br>  It's truly that simple.|`|55nophEPaa	www.urantiabook.org<br>  <br>  this book will tell u everything u need to know about everything.|`|0EkJQEV9aa	no one created God, he just was. this is called a supernatural mystery, he created earth by his power, and He did the same thing when he created us.|`|hQDapmICaa	Thanks for manifesting your foolishness. You lost 5 points for asking this foolish question. This show that being foolish doesn't pay.<br>  <br>  Peace!|`|vDr5aROwaa	No one created God. He has no beginning as  we know a beginning, and as for how did he created the earth and us? Read the first chapter of Genesis.|`|I0aosHnuaa	there is NO god ... there is NO father xmas ... our parents made us ... WAKE UP !!!|`|c6mG9bIiaa	First of all, God always existed. He was always there. As humans, we try to form a theory for how God was created. He wasn’t though. We, as humans, cannot understand God’s ways. We don’t know how he created us or the earth. He just did. With God, anything and everything is possible.|`|qjdX24Rbaa	Dang Atheists. <br>  <br>  These things are beyond our mind. The methods God uses are beyond imagination. This may sound stupid... but that is why there is faith. You either go with our self and believe that you came from a dumb animal, or you believe that there is more to life then crime and living for your own pleasure. It all depends on your morals.|`|jNQ0BhODaa	people were scared that someone might not watch over them show they imagined god|`|xUXpfKyIaa	Man created god, god didn't create us. God didn't create Earth either.|`|yA3WJaViaa	Man created god.|`|RYWCrY59aa	no one knows . uhh he just created us|`|nvGBmYvsaa	i don't know!
6f812b070bb6a7494447f70abb1119fdaa	Frankly, Christians are NOT supposed to publicly display their faith.  It's part of the "preaching on street corners" that Christ taught against in the Sermon on the Mount.  It's done for the sake of being seen as faithful to other people and gain status as appearing pious and faithful on earth, and there they have all they wanted.  Christ said they get nothing from god for it.  He doesn't like it.<br>  <br>  That said, since atheists do not have a spiritual entity telling us what we should and should not do, and we aren't claiming to follow anything, there's no reason for us to shy from showing or not showing our mental clarity.  It's the hypocritical Christians who are all wrong.|`|qcEzJDY6aa	What are you going to display when you said you are lacking all those things to display?|`|gGmMw2vDaa	Low self-esteem makes religionists the way they are. Forgive them their sins.|`|3ibsZ4mTaa	There are buses in London that say "There's probably no God. Now stop worrying and enjoy your life."|`|1aa8b20a9151f0263c0e250dfc8c3448aa	That is a very good point.|`|31M2IDw2aa	Have you ever watched that little thing they call a TV?  What planet do you live on?|`|pbTtiPqOaa	I'm not trying to be ignorant, but why would an atheist care, since Christians are primarily concerned (with some exceptions) about the next life not this life. An atheist cannot be concerned about the next life because (as far as I know) they don't believe in such a thing.|`|oGRsxfBiaa	I agree with what Crystal said, if you go around telling people how you think they are somehow less intelligent than you just because they believe and tell them how you think the idea of God is stupid or whatever then understandably they would be upset. However if you simply state that you do not believe in God in a respectable manner I don't see why anyone would be upset with you.|`|hQDapmICaa	How do you display your lack of Faith? Do you quote religious scriptures and say I don't belief this and I don't belief that?<br>  <br>  Peace!|`|sebhK7r7aa	I don't have a problem with an atheist displaying their lack of faith, it's when they start to mock and insult others that I have a problem.|`|wTB9xTvDaa	probably cause fundamentalist dont like it.<br>  But, people are not supposed to be radical about their position on religion, cause then people are offended.|`|b32jC7pGaa	Whenever a 'christian' tries to convert me, I reply with a polite, "Piss off, buggar!"|`|dLsx3fKuaa	If they look down on you, you must look down back on them. Neither of you have any right to judge each other because of your humanities.|`|AA10471679	LOL!!!<br>  <br>  Come on.  When was the last time an atheist couldn't do anything he wanted to do?<br>  <br>  Or are you upset because people don't like you?  Awwwwwwwww.|`|5CtneNPvaa	if you don't see anyone saying anything, perhaps you should say something.  i always here someone say something because that someone is me.<br>  <br>  if the only common denominators in your non-hearing of protest is you, it makes me wonder why you are too afraid to speak up.|`|cWEo1lgcaa	I've been there and have been done exactly that. The best thing to do is to try to show that you're a good person. Manners, politeness, good etiquette, etc. My friends really changed their perspective about me once I showed my selflessness. Good luck!|`|YLW7cEjkaa	You're going to offend someone no matter what you say. I face it too, I'm a Christian. If you want to see people getting offended at Christians, read any question in this section...|`|Qc6MqcpWaa	The majority usually wins. I can sympathize.|`|Ba5PVgHMaa	If you say it in a respectable way, i dont see why or how anyone should judge you.|`|NuXv6YLWaa	ignorance|`|X2HWMPfWaa	Atheists still have a faith in what they believe|`|X0iWlj8raa	As a "Christian" myself, I just want to apologize for all of the people who attach the 'Christian" label to themselves as a way to tell people they are better than anyone who isn't a "Christian." <br>  <br>  Jesus taught us to love all people. We are all the same, we are all sinners, nobody is above or below anyone else in this world in terms of God's love for us. He loves us all, and some of us choose to love Him back, and some choose not to. It's the decision of every single person to accept God's love or reject it. God made it clear to every human that He is God, through all He created, as creation shows His work (Romans 1:20). <br>  <br>  The world we live in is a confusing place sometimes. It is a fallen, sinful world that is full of lies, and it is also a world that can be full of absolute beauty, wonder, love, etc. <br>  <br>  It is very easy to overlook God when our daily lives make life feel worthless, too busy, etc. When we see all the bad in the world, it is easy to ask God why He allows this to happen. The answer: This is not how He designed it. The fact He gave us free will, the ability to love God or not to love God is the reason the world is the way it is. We chose to disobey, and this world is the consequence of that.<br>  <br>  He gave us free will in order to CHOOSE to love God. A forced action is not a choice. If God created us without free will, just to love Him, that love would be false. How much more beautiful is it when one of His children CHOOSE to love Him? <br>  <br>  I am sorry for all of the people trying to "convert" people into Christians, as we all should know... a person cannot change the way another lives or thinks, it is up to that person and God. <br>  <br>  Those who believe in Jesus, live their lives for Him, and want to share what has changed their lives to others, should be doing so the way Jesus taught us. Not pushing our beliefs on others, but sharing in love what has changed our lives.<br>  <br>  "When we confront sin in the right spirit, we are acting in love. When motivated by love, we won't be self-righteous and feel that we are better in the eyes of God. A loving heart is humble, knowing that before a holy God all people are equal ( Romans 3:9,23 ; Galatians 3:22 ; 1 John 1:8 )."

Is that acceptable?<br>  <br>  You must know that from the moment a line of research is introduced to the moment of being able to use such research for medical purposes years of studies, analysis, trials and errors pass by. And most of these experiments are not even envisaged to "cure" illness, but just to have a better understanding of the whole field. And for some pieces of knowledge you would sacrifices human lives?<br>  <br>  I spent too many years in a lab to worship Science or scientists. Most researchers are not as nobles as they would like you to think.|`|AA11297267	Actually, it *doesn't* require cells from a human fetus.<br>  First, the cells come from embryos -- just-barely fertilized eggs, done outside a woman's body through in-vitro fertilization, allowed to divide a few dozen times, then frozen to stop them.  It's a couple thousand cells, not a fetus.  There are also lines of research being done on adult stem cells, though those cells are not as flexible as embryonic stem cells.<br>  <br>  When in-vitro fertilization is done, usually only one to three of the fertilized embryos are implanted, though a dozen or more are "made."  If the woman in question becomes pregnant, the remaining embryos are *thrown away* in most cases.  Destroyed.  Wasted.<br>  <br>  If taking a few cells from a barely-fertilized egg could result in cures for alzheimer's, spinal cord injuries, and a host of other ills...don't you think it would be a better use of those cells to use them for that instead of just throwing them away?  I do.<br>  <br>  They aren't a fetus.  They aren't ever going to become a fetus. They aren't ever going to become a child.  They're no more a child than a few of the hundreds of thousands of skin cells that flake off your body every day -- they just happen to be undifferentiated at that stage, so in the right conditions they can grow into any kind of cell in the body.  It's not like we're making babies just to kill them and steal their cells...<br>  <br>  Perfectly moral and ethical.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|tI1NHwfBaa	Gee, you don't have any bias there, do you?  <br>  <br>  Speaking as a "crotchy bastard," I have to say that I'm concerned about the devaluing of human life, regardless of how we do it.  I don't think it's healthy for a society to end the lives of those who are difficult to care for like the handicapped and the elderly, and I don't think it's healthy for a society to feed on the carcasses of unborn babies to make itself stronger.<br>  <br>  It all sounds a little too much like the Nazis and the Stalinists to me.|`|148565275a23799bf1e9924c8a505d97aa	Oh please, well-traveled (if you are one, indeed!) - what difference does it make if we are talking about an embryo (up to 8 weeks from conception) or about a fetus? It is still human life - or you think that life "suddenly" appears in the fetus at a later stage? <br>  There are ways of getting hold of embryonic stem cells without using unborn babies or IVF embryos - for example the umbilical cord is full of pluripotent cells that could be used in research.<br>  <br>  So stem cell research is not morally wrong but beware of what you sacrifice for it.|`|yBXLgHbmaa	Of course it's okay!<br>  it's saving lives and making them better.|`|gxWYcxa3aa	I think there's nothing wrong with stem cell research. Parents are making the choices.<br>  <br>  Not that I don't feel sorry for the kid-that-will-never-be, but hey. Your parents decided to axe it. I can respect that.|`|lNgGphHOaa	There are adult stem cells available. Embryonic is wrong. Adult stem cell is not. One cannot employ evil to accomplish good. There is danger in our trying to decide who has the better right to live.|`|jQXza1aSaa	I say that we should allow stem cell research, why should we let people die just to save a parasites life?

You can use the same arguments that people used against inter-faith and inter-racial marriages, it leads to incest, bestiality, polygamy, the fall of the Western Civilization, and the coming of the Anti-Christ.|`|z3uUtr33aa	lmao to maggie " i dare you" nothing except the fact that people have a huge problem with it!|`|VmLZFN4Taa	There are no cons.

Luckily, there is adoption for those of us who do want kids. :)|`|ZSlXrXsCaa	The only con I could possibly think of is that we can't create children, but then the opposition could just say that the world already has too many children without care. I agree No Cons|`|fm2ba4ubaa	no reproduction :(|`|zF6zkFfbaa	Perhaps you can say same-sex couples could adopt children which might be teased or that it cost money giving benefits to gay couples. You can of course take the bigot route and say their an abomination but pray there is not a gay crowd in the class.|`|GGf3XRBCaa	The only cons are living with the bigotry, hatred, violence, and murders done to gay and lesbian people by narrow minded heterosexual people. <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|hyYWX82Eaa	...there really AREN'T any. <br>  <br>  but there are some bad ones.

If they were to give it to homosexual couples, the government doesn't really get anything back because same sex couples don't naturally reproduce.  The government wants traditional family units.  It's not just about being able to reproduce.|`|z2xRXM5Laa	First off, there are NO reasons why same-sex couples shouldn't "get to share benefits the same way hetererosexual couples do."  (Those were your words from your question)...I am a lesbian.  I have been one ALL of my life, and that's nearly 39 years.  I've never been with men in any way other than friendship.  It has been my own experience that the "cons" of same-sex relationships is that we are subjected to a lot of unfairness and mistreatment.  Jobs, relatives, government laws, military...There are many areas where it is  difficult for homosexuals.  But that doesn't mean that heterosexuals lives should be described as easy.  I am just answering your question in my own opinion about the cons of same sex relationships.  We are often stared at or ridiculed, even physically attacked or killed - just for being openly gay in our relationships.  There are often religious people who verbally attack us and/or put church flyers on our cars or in our mailboxes just because THEY think we need this.  Because they don't agree with who we are.  But do the religious people send their flyers and nagging to the heterosexual couples who have horrible relationships?  No.  There are heterosexual couples who cheat, lie, rape, marry for money or for citizenship, molest children, have threesomes, beat each other...All kinds of horrible things.  Yet it's the homosexuals who are accused of ruining the sacred bond of marriage.  What a joke!  And YES, homosexuals can procreate, of course.  Just because we don't desire heterosexual sex amd heterosexual relationships, doesn't mean that we are unable to produce children!  Gay people often have children through a sperm donor or other means.  I hate when people say that gay people shouldn't be together because we can't have children.  We can.  Shouldn't their ignorant theory also mean, in fairness, that heterosexuals shouldn't be together if THEY are unable to have children?  It all sounds ridiculous.<br>  Gay and lesbian couples share true abiding love, share financial responsibilities, take care of one another in sickness and in health, raise kids together...  We shovel out each other's cars in the winter, we are there in that hospital when our spouse has an emergency, we help each other pay bills, rent, buy food, do laundry together, share banking...We have ALL of the same things going into our relationships that heterosexual couples do. There really is NO reason why homosexual couples should not be entitled to the same benefits as heterosexual couples.  Good luck with your debate.  I hope you educate those people on this subject.|`|4ab8439e5bb68131be2c8b6ff9ed3557aa	Here's a major con: Having to deal with idiots who think we shouldn't have rights... And teachers who make people argue against same-sex relationships.<br>  <br>  REFUSE TO ARGUE THE SIDE. <br>  <br>  No, seriously. Start out listing cons people state, and then at the end just say "But after further investigation, we have come to the conclusion that all cons are fabricated by homophobes, ultra-conservatives and the religious fundamentalists, thus we concede our arguments and admit defeat".<br>  <br>  DO IT. D: Revolt!|`|Ge7MnE5Eaa	putting all the moral issue aside, I would say that they should not receive the same benefits as heterosexual couples for a couple of reasons.<br>  <br>  1. if homosexuals are allowed benefits, then what is stopping other people who might be simply roommates from demanding benefits, and "working the system" ...<br>  <br>  2. they're called BENEFITS for a reason, not RIGHTS... they are BENEFITS, and a PRIVILEGE..<br>  <br>  <br>  basically, there are no good reasons without including the morals of this issue.. without morals, anything goes, and you can't say anything against anything, really....... <br>  personally, I believe in only heterosexual marriage, because I follow Jesus Christ and believe in what He has taught through His word, the Bible, and that anything else is wrong.  I'm not the one judging homosexuals, it's in God's word... that's the standard.|`|FfMv8pipaa	WoOt! Maggie M!<br>  She's right, there are no cons.<br>  Gay, bi, and lesbian couples should be allowed to share benefits!<br>  <br>  Along with Maggie M-I dare you to put that in the debate.|`|4tmiXC4Iaa	BULL ****!
gfmTgLDKaa	There is some signs of insanity going on around your friend's boyfriend. Young love isn't true love, as time flies by they'll realize that they don't truly love each other...and bam it's already too late. That's why you should, as her friend, reassure her to rethink about this boy. But once her mind is set, you can't change that no matter how hard you try, but you do have to try before such events are enacted. <br>  Just tell her this, if you marry him and you have kids, guess how they're going to be like? o.O|`|Dd24GFSHaa	Well, unless they plan on running away together, the only thing you can really do is just keep talking to her, telling her your opinions of him, and let her make her own decisions.  And don't call her crazy if she insists that she's a vampire- just tell her that vampires are dead people and that she looks pretty much alive to you.  And that you're pretty sure that she doesn't drink blood.|`|oi6eHkPzaa	First of all, your friend is just seeking attention.<br>  Secondly, there is no such thing as vampires.<br>  Third, even if they were real, how is it possible to be a reincarnated one? Aren't they supposed to be immortal?<br>  Also; there is no proof of reincarnation either.<br>  <br>  Just don't indulge them. They're acting very immaturely (imao).|`|eeb898bd256e45f62aa2f9354d7b958baa	Hose them down with water.

In time they will get bored and move to the next attention grabbing novel/game.|`|RrQNJsVsaa	geeze, of coarse 14 year olds would believe in vampires! I'd suggest you... Well it may take a peice of your body but the only way out is to show off her drinking someone's blood, eating gore!|`|HmKY6qZDaa	Have either of you read Twilight? <br>  Well you can't do anything and she's going to a shrink<br>  GIver her time to tell you<br>  If she doesn't tell her you found out<br>  and that you're there for her but give your opinions about her bf<br>  and be honest dont try to make it seem like you are trying to break them up

AA11700517	The first thing that came into my mind was "Mulan", but the way Disney portrays Chinese people is very stereotypical and ignorant. They practically depicted all the Chinese characters with slanted eyes, yellow skin and flat face. But I'm not suprised though. This shows how racist people are, even in cartoon Industry. Not only are Asian under represented, they're also stereotypically represented.<br>  <br>  BTW, Samurai Girl is also one of the only Disney Asian film/movie.<br>  <a href="http://editorial.sidereel.com/Images/Promos/samurai_girl_poster.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://editorial.sidereel.com/Images/Pro...</a>|`|CBKjEvp5aa	I was going to say Mulan.

NWa45ZDIaa	JW's do not "argue." We don't need to "argue" or debate. We as JW's are serious Bible students, we follow in Jesus footsteps as he proclaimed to everyone about God's Kingdom & commanded his followers to do the same. He often removed himself from situations that were unproductive, he didn't come to the earth to argue about God & when those who wanted to argue pressed the issue with him he either gave back a kind, humble & knowledgeable answer or removed himself from the arguer's presence & even in the case of his trial before being put to death, he remained silent when it was obvious those opposing him didn't want to do anything but argue & find SOMETHING to accuse him of. He had nothing to be accused of, so they made up lies & slandered him. This happens to JW's all the time. We are not all eloquent speakers, we are always learning, but like his apostles who were considered "ordinary & unlettered" at times, we politely & respectfully talk to anyone who wants too discuss the Bible, about Jehovah God, about Jesus & his ministry, about the hope for the future that God promises us through the scriptures & even about JW's beliefs. We do not go out to look for arguments, sadly argumentative people come looking for us.<br>  <br>  Does this answer your question? <br>  <br>  I'm curious why you asked this question FOR Jehovah's Witnesses & yet NON-JW's are answering for us? I'm also curious if you actually believe these people? I hope you don't.|`|AA11025703	I am a Christian, one of Jehovah's Witnesses.<br>  <br>  In general I've found getting in any kind of argument, ends badly for both parties.<br>  <br>  That said, I'd say I am rather good at explaining, and if need be, defending my beliefs.<br>  <br>  Is EVER Witness equally good at explaining everything equally??

We don't argue, we reason by using scriptures from the Bible.  Without God's Word, we cannot do a single thing.  When we are out door to door sharing the good news of God's Kingdom, we pray to Jehovah for courage and ask for his holy spirit to help us to recall the right scriptures to use, the right words to say so that we can have conversations with our neighbors about God's promise for mankind in the future, or to answer people's questions regarding the truth about God and his son Jesus.<br>  <br>  Isaiah 50:4: The Sovereign Lord Jehovah himself has given me the tongue of the taught ones, that I may know how to answer the tired one with a word. He awakens morning by morning; he awakens my ear to hear like the taught ones.<br>  <br>  The Bible works like a dictionary.  The dictionary has reference of synonyms; Bible has cross reference of scripture(s) to help us to understand God's Word for what it is, to understand his will and do it.  That's all.|`|3aVxJYf6aa	Yes......we study the bible very much...and our answer are bible based.<br>  <br>  For example...NINA BAC.....have more than 2 years....attacking JWs.....according to her God commanded her to HELP JWs.....if you check her profile you will see the answer of JWs ...normally extense....logical...and full of verse of the bible.......seem that the only important thing in the bible is to believe Jesus is his own father...YES....Jesus been Son of God almighty...and god almighty at the same time ...Which is illogical..but many people believe that.|`|BzrUWCsDaa	I don't argue.<br>  If someone isn't interested then that's up to them, their decision.<br>  I make a defence for my faith but it doesn't degenerate into arguing<br>  <br>  When we go on the ministry, it is our decision. ..our decision how & when we go & how often etc. If someone didn't feel that they could do that then they wouldn't.<br>  There are all different personalities among us & some are more shy than others or find it harder to converse with people than others. This is where holy spirit helps. Jehovah gives his holy spirit where it is needed most. Some need it more than others in this aspect of their worship<br>  <br>  Interesting question<br>  <br>  Would you like to study the bible with me?|`|yz6qXwUiaa	Jehovah's Witnesses are taught the Bible extensively.  We know what it says, and can usually "argue" if you like that word successfully on a subject we know well.<br>  <br>  In reality it isn't supposed to be an argument and when the conversation deteriorates to that point we will usually excuse ourselves and leave.  However as the apostle Peter said Christians should be "always ready to make a defense before everyone that demands of you a reason for the hope in you, but doing so together with a mild temper and deep respect."<br>  <br>  Certainly each of us Jehovah's Witnesses will be at different levels of our knowledge and spiritual maturity.  Sometimes a person might not know the exact answer to every Biblical point and we are urged to not "guess" or "give our opinion" if we aren't sure, but to do research and learn more fully what the Bible teaches before replying on a subject we aren't real certain about.<br>  <br>  How many of these subjects there might be would depend on the individual, their years of studying the Bible and their memory (or lack thereof).  Normally though new students of the Bible are not encouraged to go door to door.  They must have a basic knowledge of it and believe it before they go with us in the ministry.<br>  <br>  So all Jehovah's Witnesses learn the same things, and we can all defend our faith.  New students might not be able to at first, but they are trained in what the Bible really teaches, so in time they know how to defend the truth of the Bible as well. but no I don't think any were ever refused the privilege of preaching because their ability was "poor".  We train our ministers.<br>  <br>  You have to understand that our meetings aren't lightweight as far as Bible truth is concerned.  We are constantly studying and DEEP Bible truths at that.  Most people who go to church don't get more than a small fraction of the Bible education we get.  Many of them know what they "believe" but can't show it to you from the Bible or if they can, they can't answer you when you show them other texts on the same subject that perhaps they've never seen before.  These other texts ofte present a totally different idea than the ones they are expounding, and they can't really explain that.<br>  <br>  Jehovah's Witnesses on the other hand tend to look at all the scriptures on various subjects and so when something may seem unclear we can explain why one scripture may seem to contradict another, but actually doesn't.|`|MSHxYrLEaa	well, i don't claim to know the entire bible back to front. its a big book and i often forget stuff :p to be honest i can usually remember scriptures, but not where they are >.<<br>  <br>  if someone asks me a question i don't understand, or know, then i will tell them that, then do some research, and come back with the answer. it will teach me something as well :p

He exists eternally in three persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (Matthew 1:18-23, Mark 12:29, John 14:26, Matthew 28:19)  There is one God (Allah).

Like I wouldnt go to a salon or anything. However I enjoy a true tan around summertime. <br>  I dont mind people that are into tanning at all. Just not my preference.|`|16EYP0Xiaa	Don't need to, my Southern Italian ancestors gave me a nice olive skin complexion.<br>  <br>  So, I don't have to deal with sunburn like most white people, but [because of heredity and a good Mediterranean diet] nor do I have to deal with the much higher rate of heart disease, hypertension, strokes and diabetes, and 10 year shorter average lifespan, like most black people. [Chris Rock was right "fried foods have killed more black people than racism ever has"]<br>  <br>  However...if I had to choose between the white peoples' sunburn problems or the black peoples' health problems, I'd take the pasty white skin, thank you and you could laugh at me if you want, because sunscreen is a LOT cheaper and easier to work around than dialysis. Sorry if the truth hurts, but I'm just keeping it real here!|`|82av0TbQaa	I like tanning in the summer.  Having color in your skin is nice and refreshing looking.  It makes it look like you care what you look like I guess, to white people anyway.  In the winter I do not tan because it looks silly.  I don't think the ones that tan dislike their skin color, they just like a glow in it.  However, it is horrible for your skin especially for a white person because our skin is not made to handle the sun light as a black or hispanic person is.|`|EgsE5RFaaa	I used to when I was a teenager because I was teased immensely as a child for having very pale skin.

I vehemently reject anyone, including the media, telling me that I am "too pale."<br>  <br>  The reason why whites tan is because these days, being tan is a status symbol. It shows that you can afford to go to tropical places, and/or that you have a lot of leisure time to just "lay out by the pool" Most whites do not actively seek tans, although there is this, I'd almost call it a subculture, of whites who find pale skin disgusting.

I don't go outside without jeans and a hoodie and sunscreen (at least SPFT 75)<br>  I love my skin tone. The paler the better.

Has she confirmed this, or do you just have 'strange feelings?'

That is against the code of ethics. If she actually is doing something to you, that is considered psychic attack - not 'white' magic.<br>  <br>  I am going back to my first statement though - I really doubt that she's doing anything to you in the first place.

It is not a "real" grimoire and even people, such as chaos magic practitioners, who use it for magick or psychonautic techniques know that it is not a "real" grimoire. Magick ranges from all different flavors of post-modern magic to ceremonial magic to  folkcraft to New Age fluffy stuff to shamanism to goetia. How does a person "abuse" "white magic"? If you think someone is "playing with you," you are being paranoid or are easily manipulated and suggestible. If someone really is "playing with you" through magical means, that's not "white magic." If you play back, you are practicing magic--and isn't that against the Christian ethic? Ceremonialist perform something called the Kabbalistic cross and the lower rite of the banishing pentagram to keep themselves protected from negative energies. Look 'em up.  There are other ways to perform banishing, purifying, or deflecting rituals and spells. Don't they  teach you those things in Christian exorcist school? <br>  <br>  And what is the 3X law in action?

Trust your instincts- you are feeling a little creeped out for a reason. You may think you know this guy but you only know him in a certain context and you have never been alone with him. For safety's sake, meet him in public places and make sure that people know where you are.  Better safe than sorry. If this guy is legit and to be trusted then he will understand and respect your wishes and boundaries. Run away from any guy who doesn't.|`|GvBtoKsqaa	I would suggest you don't go over to his place until you know him better. But come up with something better than coffee. Just ask him what he does for fun and the first thing he says that does not involve being at his house ask him if he wants to do that.|`|sEPjAHX4aa	thats disgusting. he is too old.|`|drzN1kkuaa	RAAAAAAPE|`|2404nDvSaa	maybe but sure to be aware in case of stuff...|`|a6a5ee67f2bc70e723086b11422d4c3daa	hes too old dont do it|`|JV0i77uiaa	He should invite you for a cup of coffee or a dinner, not to his apartment.  By all means don't go to his apartment until you know him well and be sure you tell your friends where are you.  Don't feel bad because you agree to say yes, we all do that.  We have the right to change our mind.  Tell him the true, that you rather go to someplace else.  Meet in him in a restaurant or your friend's place but not in his apartment.  If he likes you why had not invited you at least for a cup of coffee?|`|qL3dGTXDaa	HE is not the same person off the rink. I am not saying he is bad but your relationship is not the same as it is at his place of business. Coffee shop meeting is the best way to go. guys with manners would never invite a girl over until a relationship was established. Way to awkward.|`|YSuc7L8taa	Do you want him as a friend or as a boyfriend?<br>  Make your intentions clear to him. If you want to be just friends, decline the home visit and suggest an alternative place to meet.<br>  Now is the time to lay your cards on the table!|`|9u4MQWHNaa	What kind of loser thirty-four-year-old works at a skating rink and hangs out with teenagers?<br>  <br>  Ewwww.  Aim high, I guess.|`|6jrv0MWTaa	Always make sure someone knows where you are.<br>  <br>  Ask him out for coffee a few days before going to his place.|`|8OREBeRdaa	- when in doubt, DON'T.<br>  - It does sound pretty creepy.  Trust your gut instincts.<br>  - I suggest you meet him publicly first.<br>  - if you insist on going to his place, let other people know where you're going AND bring a friend.  Safety first. <br>  - The guy sounds like he just wants to bed you and be done with you.  What kind of 34 yr old kisses their 18 yr old friend on the forehead?  I'm getting the "willies" here. This has 'ulterior motive' written all over it. <br>  <br>  I believe in the "1/2 your age + 7" guideline when it comes to dating.  That means if he's 34 divided by 2 (that's 17) PLUS 7- means he really shouldn't be dating girls younger than 24.  Now, if you're still insistent, then it's ultimately your decision but you need to be VERY forthcoming with him.|`|O4jGlC2caa	If you feel strange in the slightest, then hold off.  Go out for coffee instead for a few times.  Right now the only environment you know him in is the skating rink.  Go out to dinner a few times.  Get to know him.<br>  <br>  It's good that you are being cautious.  That is a big age difference, and at 18, you are still learning about the world.  He may have a strange fetish for "barely legal" girls.  Then again, he may be a great guy.  I say get to know him first in a public forum before you go over to his house... and if you do go over to visit... do so in the daytime as to not send the wrong signals.|`|ZYCRkgawaa	He is interested and if you say yes then he will think you are interested. Guys, especially because of a lack of maturity, like younger uncomplicated girls. And girls like guys that are more mature than their age group.<br>  <br>  But....the difference in age is too great, even when you are 28 and he is 44. I know a lot of couples where there is a large age difference and it is a problem in later years. I have no doubt he could be interested in you and vice versa. It is just too much of a difference now, and later it will be worse. It could be a great teacher-pupil experience for both of you but I still say resist. <br>  <br>  I once dated a girl 10 years younger than me and figured she couldn't be interested in me long-term. Then she married a guy 20 years older than her. They are still together!!!! But I know he has to be on medicare by now. If you date him you and he will be mostly alone because neither of your age groups will think you fit.|`|MxyTWnMyaa	Don't go to his house alone - you should get to know him  better. Go somewhere public, maybe with some friends. Then, once you are SURE he's not a crazy guy, you could probably go listen to some music at his house.(:|`|Qtgrx3Ywaa	Well, I think you should set some boundaries first.  Like meeting places like a theatre of a cafe before moving onto his or your house.|`|05693f2757616086485caa4b97205935aa	Tell him you are too young for him and he should date women his own age, the perv.|`|E638ukebaa	He wants to get into your pants.|`|vWZHeoJ1aa	He wants to bang you|`|BRVNx6ZPaa	if i were you i wouldnt. i dont want to turn on the tv and see a raped dead girl that asked if she should see this guy|`|gLlJpqUvaa	dont do it he might be expecting something else if you go he might have the picture that you like him and might even try to come on to you be very careful you dont need to be with someone that old or even hanging with an older man enjoy your childhood have fun and enjoy life but dont jump into things that might jepordise your safety be careful..hope this help and if you have a close bond with your mother talk to her and see how she feels about all this parents know best even though we dont appreciate them the way we should but they always know best|`|lct6XftFaa	34 and 18..hey if you like older guys go for it. in the end its your decision  who you are with. For him having a 18 year over is cool. For others it might be a bit creepy. But just let him know how you feel. He would probably understand and everything will be cool. If he doesn't understand then he is definitely up to something else. But just let him know how you feel its the only way to make things clear between you and him. You are in you adult stages....

BhzCW1rYaa	I have had close encounters of the 3rd and the 4th kind... Here is a previous answer...<br>  UFOs per se, have been visiting the earth since the dawn of our time, that is well documented in many ancient cultures..<br>  The big cover-up is because of mainstream religion, you don't have to be a genius to work out why they want it covered up, do you ??...<br>  The Church is the biggest money institution on the planet and the government, anyone's government will do all they can to keep a lid on it, even murder people who have absolute proof..<br>  I am an abductee and a very out spoken one at that, all the seminars I attend, I bring up this question... <br>  If you had 3 questions you could ask an ET, would one of them be about religion and God ?!?!, well you can bet that question has been asked and they didn't like the answer, so to keep all the sheep grazing in their perspective paddocks they cover it up vehemently... <br>  <br>  I have seen perhaps 30-40 UFOs, possibly more, as I stopped counting years ago.. I saw my first UFOs through my bedroom window when I was 8 years old, they were in formation and there were between 5-7 of them, and that night changed my world forever..<br>  When I woke up in the morning I shot straight upright in bed and felt different somehow, and I went and informed my mother that I was no longer going to Sunday School as I no longer believed in any of it..We were not a religious family and my father had died, so that was that, I had no argument from my mother..<br>  Over the next X amount of years I searched for something that I believed in, and at age 13, I discovered Wicca and that felt right to me.. I tried to join a Coven, but at my age and the year being 1970, well, I was a minor and Wicca and Witchcraft was only whispered.. By age 20 I was a 3rd degree Wiccan Priest..<br>  Back to the UFOs, I spent many years as a Diamond Driller in the outback of Australia and I saw may unexplained things, both in the air and on the ground..In 1984 I saw a UFO on the ground, and the only reason I could see it as I was 40 feet in the air, up the mast of my Drill Rig doing a minor repair on night-shift.. I have a witness to this one as my off-sider saw it too..It would take me ages to explain all of that, so I will skip a few hours..When we knocked off at 5:00 AM, I grabbed a torch and a 6 pack of beer and went to have a look for it, and my off-sider said I was mad and no way was he coming with me..The next thing I remember is waltzing back into camp at about 11:00 AM, and I still had 5 beers left, no real memory as to where I had been for the last 6 hours, but I wanted to take the Toyota and go back and have another look, but the Boss said no, so I went to bed, that was in Sth Aust...<br>  About 3 months later I was Drilling in Western Aust, and I woke up about 4 -5 miles from camp on the track that lead to the homestead.. I was stark naked, no real idea where I was, and no idea of the time..I took a guess and walked off down the dirt road, with the moon high I could see OK..<br>  I spotted our camp at almost day-light and wandered in, much to the surprise of my work mates..<br>  I would like to say this, the country I was in was desert country, quite rocky and lots of spinifex, very prickley..I was unscathed, when I began my walk back to camp, I only hurt myself on the walk back, so how did I get to where I was in the first place ?? No I don't sleep walk, no drugs or beer were involved.. You see when they abduct you, you always have what we call "missing time", and they don't always put you back from where they took you... <br>  That is only 2 of my abductions, I am a multiple abductee, and would not have any idea as to how many times they have taken me, as you don't always remember the missing time..<br>  The last time they took me was about 4 months ago, as I was driving home from the City, as I still live in the bush..<br>  This is a first for me as far as I know, I have 4 hours missing time, and I woke up in my car parked on the side of the road on the wrong highway, to get to my town, as a matter of fact I was about 45-50 Kms from where I should have been..<br>  The clock in my car, was 4 hours slow and my trip meter didn't add up when I did the calculations the next day...<br>  <br>  The above events are true, and I have many more, and there are many I would not remember as well..<br>  One day I will go under hypnosis and have the last 43 years of my abductions put on tape or CD...<br>  I am 51 and they have taken me since I was 8, and my baby sister has confided in me, she thinks she has also been taken... Please take this seriously, they are here, and for whatever reason, they take us, millions of us share this experience, and I am not afraid of them, I don't think they mean us any harm, if they did, I think we would know by now..<br>  In Light...)O(|`|ed658ab54221fdf8e76c9f6718308484aa	Yes and I have the scar to prove it|`|gHrzn6CXaa	itz ur angel telling you yo relax...its just making sure ur ok!|`|HnMJtjjZaa	Well all this is very seventies and thing have moved on these days There is something very "Telling" in your photo and being a Photographer yourself You will know a picture is worth a thousand words<br>  To answer your question Yes I have more than once and those experiences were important learning for what is now happening to our world <br>  As you can see I also know how the email works on here<br>  <br>  edit<br>  <br>  As you can see there are facilities  [Added Detail] for updating your question I don't respond to emails while answering a question If you care to update  I will have no problem in responding accordingly|`|MqoOPi9Xaa	I'm not too much into UFOs and I don't really believe in them that much, but if you read the "Barnie and Betty Hill Case" your story and that one have much in common.

If I converted through a Chassidic group and went to a non-Chassidic group later on, they'd make me at the very least re-do the Beit Din and mikvah. I wouldn't base things on the Chassidic viewpoint, at least not for a general Judaic stance.<br>  <br>  That being said, while some Orthodox circles may believe this, no liberal - and I'm sure many individual Orthodox people feel the same way - Jewish group I know of accepts ultimately that G-d controls all events. People are supposed to care about other people.<br>  <br>  However, in Traditional/Orthodox Jewish belief where one DOES believe G-d is behind everything, they also believe G-d can do things that cannot be agreed with at times. In fact, some Jews flat out refuse to pray on Yom HaShoah (Holocaust Remembrance Day) to show just how much they disagree with what has been done.<br>  <br>  Jews have never had a problem arguing with G-d. Abraham did it, Israel did it (hence is name) and plenty of other figures in the Bible as well. We get good arguments going on all the time during or after shul. There's no understanding, and argument is perfectly legitimate. We just try.
PEUwnGHraa	No, for by one man's sin, ADAM'S, we were all made sinners. <br>  <br>  Adam [and Eve] lost life for us so we ALL have inherited sin from him. When humans were first created, Adam and Eve, they were made PERFECT --- PERFECT HUMAN BEINGS and God gave them a paradise to live in "The Garden of Eden". He gave them free reign over all creation in the earth, the animals, plants and vegetables, etc. God also gave a direct order and if they rebelled, disobeyed, they would surely die in that day. They did disobey and both died within the day they sinned; Adam was about 935 years old when he died, and Eve about 880 years old though the Bible is not exactly pin-pointed on how old she was when she died. <br>  <br>  Remember what 2 Peter 3: 8 - 10 tells us:<br>  <br>  ...One thousand years to us is but one day to God, and one day is 1,000 years"...<br>  <br>  They both grew old, rotted and died. We have inherited their imperfection, but one day soon, God will make all sins go away and the last sin to be removed from mankind is "death" itself.<br>  <br>  We were created perfect but were made sinners through one man, Adam. When Jesus came in the 1st Century, he was the perfect ransom, that perfect sacrifice to give us back what Adam lost for us: LIFE. Jesus was "the 2nd Adam". <br>  <br>  At Armageddon he (Jesus) will return once more to destroy all wicked humans in the earth and then death will be the last sin removed from mankind. We won't die anymore and there will obviously be a lot of room within the earth because most now in the earth are wicked; very evil and live outside of God and his standards.<br>  <br>  Psalms 37: 8 - 11 tells us:<br>  <br>  ..."And the meek shall inherit the earth in the abundance of peace... forever... and the wicked will be no more for we will certainly give attention to their place, but they will not be"...<br>  <br>  There's more, but I hope this has helped.<br>  <br>  Bless You.|`|flGXcxwGaa	you are reading it wrong.<br>  <br>  When Paul says that by ones man's disobedience many were made sinners he means that that everyone born of Adams seed are born sinners.

If I say there are many people on earth, that could mean that all people are on earth, but not necessarily; some may be in space.<br>  <br>  Although by the context, you can tell that Paul means that all were made sinners; he is just using the comparison of one/many to show the consequences of sin.|`|EAix5Av9aa	"All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God".<br>   "For all in Adam die and all in Christ are made alive<br>  Jesus paid the price of sin and died for us an drose again from the dead after three days.<br>    Yes we are still under the curses of Adam and Eve.<br>   That is notabily the original sin of man<br>     Focus on the redemption through obedience.<br>   Moses and all the saints of the old testament and new testament obeyed God and were blessed with obedience and cursed with disobedience.

There is no difference, 23for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,|`|YLW7cEjkaa	Romans 3:23- "for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God"|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	we are sinners saved by God's grace|`|Lt41tqwZaa	This verse is actually referring to “the many” as in everyone. If you read the rest of Romans 5, this would be abundantly clear:<br>  <br>  Romans 5:12-19 (NIV):<br>  <br>   12Therefore, just as sin entered the world through one man, and death through sin, and in this way death came to all men, because all sinned— 13for before the law was given, sin was in the world. But sin is not taken into account when there is no law. 14Nevertheless, death reigned from the time of Adam to the time of Moses, even over those who did not sin by breaking a command, as did Adam, who was a pattern of the one to come. <br>   15But the gift is not like the trespass. For if the many died by the trespass of the one man, how much more did God's grace and the gift that came by the grace of the one man, Jesus Christ, overflow to the many! 16Again, the gift of God is not like the result of the one man's sin: The judgment followed one sin and brought condemnation, but the gift followed many trespasses and brought justification. 17For if, by the trespass of the one man, death reigned through that one man, how much more will those who receive God's abundant provision of grace and of the gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ. <br>   18Consequently, just as the result of one trespass was condemnation for all men, so also the result of one act of righteousness was justification that brings life for all men. 19For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners, so also through the obedience of the one man the many will be made righteous.|`|k4d57dvJaa	Romans7:14 says " for we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin" Carnal means relating to the flesh. therefore any man walking is carnal, this would make us sold under sin. Romans 7:18 tells you that in the flesh there is no good thing. Galatians 5: 15-21 talks about the spirit vs the flesh. it says to walk in the spirit. and that the flesh is contrary to the spirit. verse 19 tells you that the works of the flesh are adultery, fornication, and ect. The book of John 6:63 tells you that the spirit quickeneth, the flesh profits nothing. we are all sinners because none of us reached perfection. If we did we would no longer be walking on earth, because when you reach perfection god takes you as he did Enoch in Genesis 5:21.<br>  <br>  If we were perfect we wouldn't die. Romans 6:23 tells you the wages of sin is death, meaning that because of sin we die.|`|Ekg4H6HQaa	Many means most people. We have seen a few people who have been able to live a sinless life.

To help you "not sin" I have a photo of Ann Coulter you can borrow while doing the deed :)|`|AA11227341	wow it is a good Q but we--believers know that it is not wise--sin. yet if your sister wanted to have a child and she went to a sperm bank would it be wrong to make a withdrawal (not yours but still how would she know it was yours) so rethink it.   not being mean but is it helping a woman to become a mother when her husband cannot give her a child, if we turn to the Bible we must trust in God to  answer our petition. so its wrong.|`|hj76FSKdaa	That would depend on what you are thinking about when you provide the sperm.

Actually, it is science.  It meets all the criteria of science, the scientific method, and hypothesis testing.  On the other hand, Creationism does not.  Therefore, it is little more than a religious opinion.<br>  <br>  Wise Duck:  The ineptitude of Creation scientists  in defending their theory is breathtaking.<br>  <br>  <br>  Paul H:  Seriously?  Wow.  Denial of the facts won't change the reality of those facts.|`|B7TFX4wUaa	That's why the professional creationists dropped the intelligent design label.  Now they want "academic freedom" to "teach the controversy."<br>  <br>  Creationists are a slippery bunch.  We should be thankful they are also largely incompetent.|`|daf653722b9a000bcaed6ea65b1dc5e6aa	I see no reason why evolution should not be taught in schools and why creation should be -- and I am a Christian, born again, et. al.<br>  <br>  I believe the Bible, so I teach my children the way they should go, and based on God's promise, they will.<br>  <br>  You really think a teacher in school, with little or no interest in your child's life beyond her class really has it in her to indoctrinate my child with evolution? Highly doubtful, not that it cannot happen, but highly doubtful.|`|50c1d92064fa2b7852c7d54f841b22d9aa	Not a creationist, but I found this interesting enough to post. When I took ninth grade biology many students said inappropriate and crass things to the teacher regarding the state of his soul. It was disgusting. The students knew little about evolution other then what they had been taught in church or by their parents. <br>  However in 11th grade when we were able to take bio II and anatomy in 12th grade no one argued. We had learned so much since that first day in 9th grade that we knew evolution had scientific validity where creation or ID (which we didn't have way back when) did not have the same validity it was a matter of faith and was not applicable in school.
nhZWAt8laa	I'm sorry for your loss , these things are never easy , but your family must try to trust God in times like this , for healing and encouragement.<br>  <br>     Please don't think that I'm being preachy , we've also lost several loved ones to cancer.<br>  <br>     And I sincerely hope that I can be helpfull , but mostly that you'll put these matters in Gods hands and trust Him. <br>  <br>  <br>    Find time alone with your dad and just Give your dad a big hug often and cry for him tell him that you love him and need him and that your greatfull to God for giving Him to you. <br>  <br>      ( Give him yourself as a reason to heal and go on with life ).<br>  <br>    And above all pray ,,pray with Him and pray when your alone for him.<br>  <br>     And if you share a hobie like fishing or something ask him to take you .<br>  <br>     And ask him to go to church with you if he doesn't already just for some special time together and with God in worship ,it's good for you to be in worship in tough times.<br>  <br>     I hope that you and your family will be blessed and that you will have many long years to enjoy life together.<br>  <br>     But mostly that you know Jesus and then you'll have each other and see your grandfather in Gods kingdom and live together forever.<br>  <br>     May God richly bless you and heal your home.|`|cXXJVz64aa	He may have cried when he was alone. Most older men don't want others to see them cry. Ask him how he feels about his dad's death. It may bring out his feelings.|`|5AbCtkWFaa	I'm so sorry for your loss.  When my grandmother (father's mother) died three years ago, I did quite a bit of cooking and baking for a week or so, as she enjoyed baking.  I found some comfort in that, especially as I wasn't able to afford to fly down for the funeral.  Is there something your grandpa enjoyed that you and your father could do as sort of a remembrance?  How is your grandma holding up?  Maybe you could tell her you're worried about your father.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry about your father imagining his dad working in the barn.  When my mother's father died of emphysema a number of years ago, there was a brief gust of wind while we were at the cemetery, and my mom and aunts all said it was like he could breathe again.  This is why I can't completely disbelieve in ghosts.<br>  <br>  But talk to your grandmother, talk to your mom (if she's still married to your dad), and any other family members.  They're probably all grieving in their own ways, and maybe you can all help each other through the grief.|`|emP32pjeaa	They can hallucinate but I had an incident when my grandmother passed away, I swear she was with me at her house that night she died.  Grieving takes time...all I can really say is just be there for him if he wants to talk, as when my grandma passed away, my father needed a lot of time to just vent and reminisce.  My dad is also the type to never cry...only seen him cry twice, when his parents passed away.  He will eventually, most likely slowly, gain his life back...but don't force him to get over it quicker than he is willing to.|`|XPjLYYC8aa	You're a wonderful child to want to help your father like that. Spend more time with him, and make sure that he has plenty of company. Take him to upcoming community events, and maybe see a movie with him, just you two. Have a family fun night with your "small family" by playing games, and just having a good time. Eventually, he will be good and happy again.|`|4e5c321b3099a1f6ff699e8cd693bc94aa	I'm sorry about your grandfather. I have a brother who is dying from lung cancer.  Try to encourage your dad to do things with you. Go fishing or go see a movie or just go for walks with him. It takes awhile to get back into the swing of things so you have to be patient. Just let him know how much you love him . Time really does help to heal wounds. Good luck.|`|jLi2Q3bMaa	you can not help him, he hasn't cry because he just died a month ago, He will cry and miss him in the family gatherings, on his b-day, fathers day, just be patient and when the time comes be there to cath him.|`|wNJetCLEaa	Be an excellent daughter to him, it will make him feel reassured about the life he has now, as well as confident that he succeeded in his life.  That is a thought that is probably heavy on his mind.|`|xhOw5yTmaa	honey, my better half's father passed away unexpectedly last year, and let me tell you, it wasn't easy. Grieving is the hardest experience we endure during life--no matter what anyone says, grief comes in a variety of styles--and the best possible thing you can do for someone who is grieving, is to let them. Will your father ever get over his father's death, NO! He never will, but each day will get a little better. Each day the pain will dull, but never go away. But it's what you do during that process of the intense pain that matters the most, and helps the most. Offer to listen if he wants to talk. Sometimes the best therapy that we can offer someone else is just a silent ear. <br>  <br>  I would also recommend that you ask your father to sit down, and write a very long, detailed letter to his father. I personally believe that our loved ones are very much present with us, even after death, but regardless of that fact, it WILL help your father by allowing him to get his emotions and feelings out, instead of having them bottled up inside. He can tear the letter up, burn it, or throw it away later, if he doesn't want anyone else to read it, but it's definitely something that will help with the grieving process.|`|ZJ2k7Ynqaa	Pray for him. <br>  <br>  Philippians 4:6,7<br>  Be anxious for nothing but in everything, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.  And the peace of God which passes all understanding will keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.|`|GJS3hTK5aa	Tell your Dad to stop worrying and instead, to pray for the departed soul. If you are a Protestant believer, you can't do this, since it is considered a sin to pray for the departed souls by them. It is their 11th commandment that "thou shalt not pray for spirits". <br>  <br>  Anyway, tell him that death is in fact our entry to another world. Your Dad can join him in the assigned time. We will all be there once. When a person is born on earth, everyone else becomes happy except for the person born. He or she comes out with a cry. The same way, when a person dies, everyone else cries except the person who dies. He laughs and becomes happy since he is entering a new world.
AA11232725	Go to the local Lutheran church and ask to talk to a Pastor or someone who can tell you what their requirements are for becoming a member.

I am aware that because of the forgiving nature of this story some scholars who do not like forgiveness sought to have it removed from the Bible.  It is also true that it is ommited from some of the oldest scrolls we have.  To say it is missing from the oldest documents is not accurate because the oldest documents do not exist and have been missing for years.  The oldest manuscripts we currently have are the Dead Sea Scrolls.  I cannot comment on their content because I dont have that information.  The King James considered the story acceptable historically and so have most of the later translations.  The story is suspect by many Bible scholars because it contains no direct rebuke to the man who must have been involved in this act of adultery.  Its pretty hard for a woman to commit adultery by herself.  It is felt by some including myself that the story is edited and this part left out.  Would God download all this sin on the backs of women and let the men involved remain guiltless?  It was not very many years ago that women in this country were charged with prostitution and the tricks were allowed to go free.  This is mans way not Gods.  God is just, and loving.  Consider also that this story was once found in Luke 21:38 as well.  If it was later  ommited from Luke was it also edited for content in John?  The first Bible commentary I picked up was Ungers and it covers this possibility P 257.  Halley does not comment on the origen of the story at all so to say it is branded as a late addition in all comentaries is innacurate.  You will find that some textual critics say some pretty unchallenged things including that the bible was all written around 200 AD by spurious fakes so I wouldnt stake too much on what they say as you will usually find someone else to say the opposite.  Sadly many of these students could survive in no other field.   I have a lot more on this chapter.  If you want it just ask.  Love Kent|`|ade88a86096da6caf982d633e21cd939aa	but you're wrong.

Aa6XHuENaa	sexual reproduction allows for greater diversity throughout the species<br>  <br>  And sex (as a pleasurable experience) not only encourages reproduction, but also serves to increase the pair bond between mates, which assures a greater level of parental investment (PI) in the male.  This is particularly important for the female (whose PI is considerably larger than the male's in terms of the physical toll that gestation takes on humans) because our young remain dependent on their parents for a very long period of time, so it is beneficial if the male sticks around.  <br>  <br>  It also serves as a defense against cuckoldry, but that's kind of a separate issue.<br>  <br>  If you would like to know more, I encourage you to message me and I'll get some sources together for you.|`|AA10057370	I'm a christian:<br>  <br>  only sex between a man and woman will produce more people.|`|B7TFX4wUaa	*sigh*<br>  <br>  "I do not think it means what you think it means.."|`|AA12059478	Lol.<br>  Have sex for pleasure and the reproduction will take care of itself.<br>  Even if you use contraceptives they're not always accurate.|`|wwdllMzYaa	that is evolution "taking care of reproduction"|`|LSJ8BmHVaa	Evolution doesn't follow a "why".|`|434cdba191b138eb36e563b9ef737a76aa	If you are an American and if you are the future of America then this country will surely go down the tubes in no time.|`|jard50Yiaa	Reproduction is the biological process by which new individual organisms are produced. Reproduction is a fundamental feature of all known life; each individual organism exists as the result of reproduction. The known methods of reproduction are broadly grouped into two main types: sexual and asexual.<br>  <br>  In asexual reproduction, an individual can reproduce without involvement with another individual of that species. The division of a bacterial cell into two daughter cells is an example of asexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction is not, however, limited to single-celled organisms. Most plants have the ability to reproduce asexually.<br>  <br>  Sexual reproduction requires the involvement of two individuals, typically one of each sex. Normal human reproduction is a common example of sexual reproduction.|`|3GAiVmEAaa	What does this have to do with evolution? Sexual reproduction allows for more varied genes, which is good.

We don't think about how vital food is from a biological perspective, we just know we have to fix the pain in our stomach. We don't think about how important sleep is for the body, we just know we want to lie down and close our eyes for eight hours. Everything the body needs is based on a pain/pleasure instinct.|`|HwquRlQ6aa	Actually, many organisms do not have sex to reproduce, nor do they need other organisms.  For humans it makes sense because it allows us to diversify our DNA through mixing it with others.<br>  <br>  That's why incestuous offspring can have genetic problems.  Inbreeding multiplies a person's genetic deficiencies while reproducing with non-relatives works to reduce the risk of genetic defects by making up for them with the other parents' DNA.

4f53edbce16f4673f58a9dcccc9dfddfaa	I'm no longer in high school, but in my junior year at a university, but has it occurred to you that some people take up these subcultures simply because they're attracted to the music and fashion?  That's why I'm goth and nothing more.  I like goth music and I like getting dressed up in a dark aesthetic, that's all.  It has nothing to do with "having it bad".<br>  And oh, although I say that, you act like all people who are goth or emo or whatever haven't suffered ever.  I don't bring it up usually because it was a brief few month period of my life last year (well, I had it for more than a few months, probably a couple years before it was diagnosed, but from diagnosis to treatment to getting back to normal was about four months), but I've had cancer and the few months I had treatment for it were definitely suffering, so yes, I'm a goth and I know what suffering is.  Although I was goth long before that, so I suppose in this case it's irrelevant.  It's also irrelevant, because as I said, my reasons for being goth have nothing to do with "suffering" or "having it bad" as you say, so even if it had happened to me when I was younger, I can't see becoming goth because of it.|`|kL8BzsBNaa	He was quite right about suffering being the only way to happyness because if you didnt ever feel suffering you would not know what happiness is. Now when i say suffering i dont mean it in the way that it brings you excruciating agony it could be as simple as being bored waiting for the bus then becoming happy when the bus comes. Also, did you know that the suicide rates for people in developed countries is usually higher than those in non developed countries. This i believe has something to do with the way our society is set up. People in our countries are so use to only a certain way of life and this way of life doesnt always appeal to everyone, eventually this turns into a broken record and when you have a repetative life it tends to lead to depression. people in other countries have dramatic things to live and die for. Everyone has an equal balance of good and bad moments in their life (for the most part except in slavery and such cases) we just think some people suffer less because they seem to be doing better than other but this is not always the case.<br>  <br>  Now that ive said that i would like to point out that i hate the emo trend and those idiots need to stop glorifying their own pain.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I never said suffering guaranteed happiness.

ctOge9SLaa	You would be surprised how very much each believer needs to know the difference between these two. I am so thankful to the Lord that we are able to be taught to discern between the two and know when we are in our soul and being lead about by the self and when we are in the spirit.<br>  The bible reveals in 1 Thes 5:23 that man is a tripartite being. Made up of a spirit, soul and body.  <br>  <br>  The soul has three faculties.<br>  The Mind to consider and think on this. <br>  The Emotions to feel many things.<br>  The Will to choose on the side of God, or his enemy. Man's will is the middle man, always presented with the choice.<br>  <br>  Man is considered a soul, a person. We are filled with personality and our soul contacts things on a psycological level.<br>  <br>  Our spirit is the deepest part of our being and has been made with a wonderful abilities and capacities.<br>  For one, it is the part of us that is made to match God.<br>  God is Spirit and man was made with a human spirit within him ( Zech 12:1)<br>  Upon hearing the gospel of Jesus Christ, and believing on the Name of the Lord, it is our spirit that is regenerated and reborn.  This spirit is joined to the Lord, to be One spirit with Him.<br>  1 Cor 6:17<br>  "But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit"<br>  <br>  Our spirit has the capacity to contain God. It has the ability to know God.  Just as a glove is made in the image of a hand, our spirit is made to contain God as our content and life.<br>  <br>  Our spirit has three main faculties.<br>  The Conscience, which is the leading part  of our spirit approves or disapproves of things in our lives. It is with our conscience that God directly speaks to us concerning all things in our lives. How we desire to have a good and pure conscience void of offences ( Heb 10:22).<br>  <br>  The next faculty is the Fellowship ( Phil 2:1).<br>  It is in our spirit that we worshp God ( Jn 4:24), where we commune with Him day by day.  The communion is not only with God, but also with all the dear brothers and sisters who are also joined to this Lord to be one with Him.<br>  <br>  The third faculty is the Intuition.<br>  This faculty is very dear and precious in that through the intuition God is able to reveal matters regarding Himself to us. Our spirit has the ability to know the things related to God, He is able to show us who He is, teach us, guide us, even when things do not seem logical, we have this sense in our spirit, this intution, that we should do a certain thing, or say a certain thing.  Learning to obey this kind of sense from the Lord is very important ( Acts 16:7).<br>  <br>  One thing, in closing, is that when we believe into the Lord and receive Him, He has intended that the spirit, and not our soul, be the leading part of our tripartite being.  Our spirit should be the source and it is our spirit that should govern and rule our soul. Using it as an organ to express God in what we think, feel and choose.<br>  <br>  The spirit we have received is not one of fear or cowardice.. but one of Power.. Love and of Sobermindedness ( 2 Tim 1:7).<br>  Power for our Will<br>  Love for our emotions<br>  Sobermindedness for our minds<br>  <br>  Our spirit has the ability to take care of every aspect of our souls.<br>  May the Lord be given such a way to spread into all our inward parts.<br>  He has come into our spirit with the intention to spread into our mind, emotion and will of our soul.  It is here that people contact us, and there is something different about us. They are seeing Birdy, but they are actually seeing Christ being expressed out from Birdy.  <br>  <br>  Keep abiding sis, as we learn Christ together may our hearts be encouraged and kept in Him.<br>  Your sister<br>  sandy|`|raDmxGpjaa	The core aspect of the human tripartate nature is the spirit.<br>  Wherever you see "heart" in the bible, it actually means spirit.<br>  The heart or innermost body of man being his spirit.<br>  The spirit is the part of man responsible with reason, or mind. Human mind is divine, since it is joined to the mind of God. The reason we feel God's guidance in our hearts, is because that guidance is coming into our deepest place, which is the spirit. This means that strictly speaking a mental illness has it's roots in the spirit, since mind is non-physical.<br>  <br>  Soul=spirit+emotions+cognitive processing. Soul is also the part of man where sin resides. That is, Satan's kingdom in man lies outside the spirit and in the territory of soul. Very often when people receive guidance from God they perceive it as inner voices, which strictly speaking means that they are walking with in faith according to soulish guidance which is not from God, because God guides the spirit.|`|knOdcrDkaa	Can't say that I do, unless the soul is individual and the spirit is more like the social feeling in the air, the "Zeitgeist" if you will.|`|TXaAsy4Kaa	no one will ever no. cause alot of people have a good sence of what they are but alot dont. its in our minds about what we have.|`|kTc3bfrRaa	spirit  is  HOW  you  feel...   <br>  <br>  soul..  is  what  makes  that  feeling  possible!!|`|aGRJ6MPdaa	The first answer sounds most accurate from where I stand...|`|yCTxg4t5aa	I suppose everyones interpretation is different.<br>  I would say that Spirit is like having passion for things, it's emotions, the things that colour our thoughts.<br>  While Soul is Me, I am a soul, my consciousness, my energy, It is what passes from body to body.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	According to the creation story in Genesis, man doesn't have a soul, he is a soul...

I believe the spirit is the life force of all living things. When we die, that life force leaves the body and continues to exist until it returns to the creator. The soul on the other hand is specific to humans and is the part of us that is of God's image. The part that is superior to other living things due to our intellect, emotion and free will. It is the aspect of humans that seeks God and in the end will know God once our spirit reunites with God.

AA11785060	All religions can usually be traced to a man originating the tale, (like Buddha or Mohammad or L Ron Hubbard) or to earlier cultural beliefs.  The jewish religion, for example, borrowed heavily from Sumarian and Egyptian beliefs of earlier times, and folklore just gets passed down and embellished and taken as fact.  <br>  <br>  I read recently that if there was really a god of the whole universe, why would he be concerned about some insignificant mammalian species on our little planet in our little galaxy.  There are estimated to be over a 100 billion GALAXIES in the universe- and each has thousands if not millions of star systems.   When the universe is larger than comparing the earth to a grain of sand, why would humans be so important.  Frankly I think it is just personal human arrogance that many people have to believe we are better than other mammals (granted most humans are smarter, though there are exceptions) and that since we are better, we must be chosen by some god somewhere that we must worship. <br>  <br>   I think our cats and dogs laugh at us a lot.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	2 Timothy 3:16<br>  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1:11-12<br>  I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up. I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors.

Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

Here's God on God:<br>  <br>  "And the LORD passed before him and proclaimed, "The LORD, the LORD God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abounding in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, by no means clearing [the guilty], visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and the children's children to the third and the fourth generation."

6064bd72a9d33a8f2e618cc79b0f9629aa	It's possible that some young men were intimate with older, more powerful men in order to live a better, more comfortable life, but it certainly doesn't explain anything about ACTUAL homosexuality.<br>  <br>  Having sex with men in the interest of politics or social status doesn't have anything to do with sexual orientation.  They were basically prostitutes if they did what this author describes, but it doesn't make them gay.|`|AA11785060	Certainly has some merit as a theory but in actuality guys just like guys. Way more than ever act on it.  Other mammals on our planet freely express their sexual attraction to other males by mounting them or licking them or being mounted.  Just nature. Humans just happen to be about the most oversexed mammalian species, so we are horny all the time.  Guys over 40 tend to "turn" or come out as bisexual, and that's probably nature's way of moving the old farts out of the way for younger more virile guys to breed  the females. Same with younger sons--- usually the older brothers are straight, and younger ones will lean to or actually be bisexual or gay--again nature at work. The mother already produced adequate breeding stock with the older sons, so the younger ones will be less likely to reproduce.  Nature's way of limiting population growth.  <br>  The ancient cultures worshipped their own image, so to speak, and were so wrapped up in themselves that self admiration often led to admiration of other males.  And of course, guys on long journeys and military excursions need to let off steam and will do anyone handy even if it is another guy.  That happens today, just considered taboo.|`|PM23RDycaa	Its pretty much the wife and mistress argument. You had your wife to bear you heirs/son and to improve your standing but you had your whore/mistress to have great sex with.  You didn't marry the woman who'd let you fold her up like a pretzel and ream the hell out of her anally.<br>  <br>  In Rome it wasn't thought of twice for a young man to be lovers with a much old man, usually their mentor. Wives were for heirs, that's it and if she couldn't give you a child or a boy you divorced her and found someone new. Depending on how nice you were she may or may not have ended up as a social outcast. You would have set her up with a fair amount of money to live a good life. If you were an *** you divorced her and tossed her on the street with the clothes on her back and no servants or gold.<br>  <br>  Male and male sex amongst the armies was encourage to better the bond between soldiers. the thought was you'd protect someone you were intimate possibly cared for to the best of your abilities rather than some fellow soldier you couldn't give two sh*ts about really. If everyone is looking out for everyone, more survive the battles, More battle survival means more battles won, more battles won more glory for the army, their general and for their rules and in the case of Rome, Cesar. you were Cesar as long as the people wanted you to be. You either inherited the title through death and being named heir or because you killed the last Cesar.|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	True<br>  <br>  In some warrior societies, such as ancient Sparta, men engaged in homosexuality so they could avoid the feminizing company of women.<br>  <br>  The reality is they had no such terms. People were just sexual. Many, many authors have used this to suggest that human nature us actually bisexual, and all other forms of sexuality are deviations. I don't know what work has been done to seriously study such hypotheses.|`|E9chZY74aa	Authors come and authors go.  The best answer of both is from the Bible.

That's the weird part, that any man would desire sex with a man, and that it would gain one favor with that man. You know? <br>  <br>  Yeah, I'm sure some guys would give BJs in return for a better life, however, why would a wealthy man even want to trade his wealth for a homosexual BJ, when he could have many women??? It would have to be some sort of weirdness that kicked it off you know...<br>  <br>  I can only think that it was our complicated brain and in an early stage of higher thinking, that some sort of sexual depravity made some powerful man, with many beautiful women, want to sexually dominate another guy..<br>  <br>  UNLESS there was a shortage of ladies, OR these guys went gay because they were so horny and no chicks wanted to mate with them, you know??? But this wouldn't apply to wealthy dudes, because they could no doubt get girls...

45Mmu3SFaa	Jesus is the way the life and the truth....|`|qPbKJeXzaa	Islam is the second largest religion in the world after Christianity. As a monotheistic faith that originated in the Middle East, Islam holds many beliefs and practices in common with Judaism and Christianity.<br>  <br>  Judaism, Islam and Christianity are collectively known as "Abrahamic religions" because they trace their history to the covenant God made with Abraham in the Hebrew Bible.<br>  <br>  The Prophet Muhammad met both Jews and Christians during his lifetime, and Islam has come into frequent contact with both of its fellow monotheistic faiths throughout most of its history. <br>  <br>  Therefore to convert between any of these three religions is not particularly surprising as they have so much in common.  It would be harder to convert someone of the three monotheistic faiths to Hinduism or Buddhism in theory, unless of course either of those religions makes more sense to you than the one instilled by the culture of your country....|`|e30cd21479ba61083d65bb804d7193edaa	:-) <br>  <br>  Some other good videos:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFEvuTqbmo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFEvuTqb...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uguiV5zyUxs" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uguiV5zyU...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IttJH2d9pk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8IttJH2d9...</a>|`|YnGIccE8aa	If you can spell "video" I may be inclined to watch a vedio.
r8rykCkGaa	Really some are demon possessed and it's like the devil has possession of everyone in the religion, but God has given us a free will in spite of all this, and this is why many manage to convert to Christianity.  However, because it is a satanic religion, those who convert will be persecuted by the Hindus.  But once they go through that and recover they are stronger for it and hopefully bring others to Christ also.

Hinduism is SANATAN Dharma. It is a Dharma and not religion in strict sense of the term. Religions are founded by some one, indoctrinated and ritualised. All organised religions have a beginning and an end. The days of all organised religions are numbered. They have out lived their utility. Hinduism is to stay on this earth and universe till infinity. So they need not be insecure.<br>  <br>  Hindusm is based on database and logic. Hindus do not follow blindly what some stupid paedophile has said some 1500 years ago. Hinduism is a sea of belief systems. Everybody has a vast variety of choices to follow some belief system within ambit of Hinduism to match their logical potential. So they need not convert to any obscure religion and need not feel insecure.<br>  <br>  It is true that being logical people Hindus are justifyably concerned towards dangers towards life system on earth due to misdeeds of other religions.

New supercedes the Old. He is still Yahweh and all that, yes, but we are saved through belief in Jesus.<br>  <br>  "For God was manifest in the Flesh, and believed on in the World." <br>  <br>  Humans doudt and turn away from God. In Faith in Jesus and a good life that bears witness to his name (NOT the same as ONLY good works, although good WORKS can be a PART of living in his image,) we have salvation and eternal life.|`|e30cd21479ba61083d65bb804d7193edaa	Maybe its the other way around.

Aa6XHuENaa	Although your scenario is admittedly hypothetical, it is equally as likely to be true as any religious dogma in existence, or any unforeseen possibility about what traits/values our "creator" would choose to reward.<br>  <br>  Someone being rewarded for using reason is just as likely as someone being rewarded for faith.<br>  <br>  Someone being rewarded for being a redhead is just as likely as someone being rewarded for being double jointed.  <br>  <br>  When it boils down to it, if there is a "creator," then it is incredibly presumtive on our part for any religious group to claim to know what he/she wants us to do with our lives.  <br>  <br>  The best you can do is be a moral person (as you perceive the notion of morality) and hope for the best.<br>  <br>  Good question.  Star for you!|`|l6mKwFb7aa	I would find that to be hilarious.<br>  <br>  I still find George Carlin's idea to be funnier:<br>  <br>  "If a guy says 'I'm going to hell with all my friends,' he's going to hell. All his friends will be there. He'll probably have a good time. If you think you're going to heaven, you'll probably get into heaven. Just don't look for your friends there."|`|fNw4wJSGaa	Treating us like toys, putting us through awful things and then, according your scenario, purposefully leading people down the wrong path?<br>  <br>  Either way, God is a jerk then isn't he?|`|AA11138696	Atheists will not go to heaven because they do not believe in it any more than they believe in God.  Would you want to surround yourself with people that did not believe in your existence?|`|gQEFy4BVaa	If life on Earth is a test, what is the point of life in the first place? I didn't ask to be tested!|`|ZA48CbNvaa	Then alot of people are ******.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	Then God could not be trusted because his  holy word says other wise|`|hAXDWhiVaa	Why would God want atheists in heaven specifically because he thought  they were logical about not believing in God? That doesn't make sense. But there's nothing wrong with questioning things. The truth is, we're not meant to know the re son for everything. We don't have the mental capacity to handle it. I also don't believe that God sends everyone to hell who doesn't believe in him, just to throw that out there. But if you've ever had a spiritual experience then you would know that there couldn't not be a God. life is too beautiful to not believe that. It may be chaotic but he created everything perfect in it's entirety. Think about the human body, how perfect everything works. Your telling me that was all chance? I know there is a God because i've seen and felt things before. Have a little faith, you might surprise yourself, honey.|`|GLMiQUcGaa	Why can't your idea be true its completely reasonable. Wars have been caused be economics for all time but god and religion is what motivates the common person. Each person prays for god to be on their side yet almost all the soldiers no matter what side you are on will probably die or be hurt, therefor god is on no ones side if he is real. Also science disproves the idea of god made by man but it was made by man not god so god could have made dinos and evolution. So in my opinion your idea is much more reasonable then many religions today.|`|SzybqjFxaa	I know a lot of people are taking this too personally, but I for one find your idea pretty interesting.  I'm a devout Rastafarian, and take my faith seriously, but this is definitely an intriguing theory.|`|H5tL0Sf9aa	Well, you decided that atheism is rational, any religious person will tell you that rational thinking concludes that there must be a god.|`|hfSKP0ZVaa	Well your question is really simple, look everything beside you with or without religion. It's God's Creation -_^, so basically people will have an idea that ther's a GOD.|`|2cfhTKhVaa	NO TEST|`|Zw9uJxOSaa	that would be very ironic and funny if that were true.|`|kQ1vPKe3aa	if it was, id get into heaven no prob... im surrounded by people who continually try to "bring me to the light"|`|cPjEXQ3uaa	A lot of people would be very upset for one thing!<br>  <br>  That is an interesting question, and you are correct in saying that it is irrational to believe in God, which, I believe is the way God wants it to be. If we could just look at tangible evidence and say,"OK, God is real, so I'll follow Him." Then we wouldn't be trusting God fully or putting our faith in Him for real. If your situation were true and I was an atheist, I don't think I would want any part of a god who would trick so many people like that. Or, being Christian, I might just be a sore loser :-)|`|d0ca08303a6076d12501f8124465e62faa	I believe that life on Earth, that our very existence, was created by him, and you see, all the evidence is already here. Why are we here? He made us. Why do birds sing? He created that too. All the evidence is here, all you have to do is open your eyes. Trust him, rely on him, you will not regret it. As for your idea, I do not think that he would allow the people who were most sensible into Heaven just because they were rational. Religion is no distraction. IF it was, he wouldn't have sent his son to die on the cross for us. It takes a lot of believing and trust to be a christian. I will pray for you. Maybe someday you will finally understand what I believe to be true. If you just happen to have a bible laying around, look up John 3:16 - 22|`|NaM4ZT64aa	Well, seeing as how and omnipotent God would already know who would fail and who would succeed, that seems pretty pointless.  He could also just create people as rationals in the first place.<br>  <br>  And do agnostics, humanists, pantheists, deists, existentialists, ignostics, etc. get in?  Those are pretty much as rational as atheists.|`|D8SpQAgLaa	That actually would make a lot of sense. The test, while on Earth, is will a person learn to think for his or her self, or just mindlessly follow a religion and what other people say is truth, without objectively examining or questioning it. It's not what I believe, but it would still make sense if it were true.|`|gr6e1WZEaa	Having faith in God and obeying his laws will mean that you are obeying laws that have worked sucessfully since the begining. If in the end you find out that there is no afterlife, you have lost nothing.|`|UyDkYaXuaa	More rational than the un hypothetical. Interesting!|`|UJtUpWO0aa	Remember!  You're an atheist...You're not allowed to believe in God!  right?|`|5tMCDu8gaa	Wouldn't make much of a difference to me really. I'm an atheist anyway.
oPQAPfYXaa	You are going to get many more different suggestions than you are answers; in other words, everybody has their own opinion of what an easily read Bible version is going to be.  <br>  <br>  I would suggest hitting your local bookstore, Christian or otherwise, and taking a look at the English Standard Version, New International Version, the New Living Translation, or the New American Standard Version.  Browse each of them and make up your own mind.  Try some others.  <br>  <br>  Myself, I use the RSV everyday, and I am more than a little fond of the Douay - Rheims, but I wouldn't recommend either of them as an easily read Bible.  <br>  <br>  So, in short, you would do best to try reading a small sample from several different versions, and then make up your own mind; after all, the very best Bible for you is going to be the one you are willing to read.  <br>  <br>  BibleGateway.Com is a fairly good site to read various versions online, and there are other good sites as well, so don't hesitate to try them out online before you shop for a paper copy...|`|ORDjVHY4aa	The King James Version is the best translation from the original Greek and Hebrew, all other versions are either translations of it, or translated from corrupted text.  And the King James Version is written at a seventh grade reading level, so if you truly want to understand it, you can. Maybe take some more time while reading or read less in one sitting. If you are honestly searching the Scriptures, God will reveal the answer, even if you don't think you can understand it.|`|d23c24d7902c41047cb2dd2259761c25aa	I prefer the KJV and the NKJV but if you want plain English the best choice is the ESV.<br>  <br>  Read it and you will understand why I make this proclamation.<br>  <br>  If you can find a good parallel Bible that include the KJV and the ESV with a solid paraphrase like the NLT, go for it..<br>  <br>  agapefromnc|`|8IHfytEvaa	NIV = New International Version<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  ESV = English Standard Version<br>  <br>  NIV is translated thought by thought making it very easy and smooth reading.  They didn't try for a word for word translation.  NIV was completed in about 1980 so its in very modern up to date English.<br>  <br>  ESV is a word for word translation which then tweaked up to make it read smoothly.  It is a bit more precise to the original languages and a bit less easy to read the NIV.  ESV was completed in 2001.<br>  <br>  Based on what you have said I'm guessing you'll prefer the NIV.<br>  <br>  Here is a link where you can compare them online for free:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/versions/" rel="nofollow">http://www.biblegateway.com/versions/</a>|`|fb32217e975ff5844cd7200fbf61284caa	If you really want to study the Bible, I suggest the NRSV in a scholar's edition such as the Oxford Annotated Bible.  The footnotes help, and the text is a lot more flowing and understandable than the two you have tried.  Get the edition which states on the cover "with the Apocrypha."  Even if your church does not accept those extra books as part of the Bible, parts of them are quoted in the New Testament, so they are necessary to a full understanding of the cultural and religious background into which Jesus came and to which He reacted (often with disapproval).|`|3KD6RRhPaa	I use the NKJV and the NIV. But I find that many of the meanings in the NIV changed putting one on another path. This is the problem with newer versions that are being printed. The guys doing it really unsaved, are sinners and read the Bible literally.|`|597c2cb57b5dd60ca91e8fdd1a7325c6aa	NIV, Living Bible, Bible in Living English, Revised Standard, American Standard, New World's Translation, and Today's English Version.|`|iAXmdQOEaa	If your not going to do major bible studies, then I would go with the ESV.    It is close to the Hebrew bible which is what you want.|`|deqX4oQQaa	Try a Parralel Bible, I have one myself.

That way you can sample before buying.<br>  <br>  I also like a parallel bible which has 4 versions printed side by side but those are hefty to tote around!|`|OKClYfDQaa	Either the New International Reader's Version or the Century English Version will do. They're simple enough. Nice move!|`|eO2rnf7yaa	I recommend The New Jerusalem Bible.  It is translated into English from the oldest available ancient texts.  The English is beautiful and contemporary without changing the meaning of the text.   It is written in what I would call "plain English".  In my opinion it is written so well that you will actually be more inclined to read it.  <br>  <br>  The edition I recommend was published in 1985, and has 21089 pages.  That edition includes some excellent bible history and translation notes. The New Jerusalem Bible is available in hardcover from Amazon.com for about thirty U.S. dollars.  The hardcover version is nice because you can lay it on your desk or lap and it will stay open by itself as you read.  <br>  <br>  The New Jerusalem Bible is approved for liturgical use by The Catholic Church.<br>  <br>  I am Roman Catholic.<br>  Peace be with you.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:  The website below does an excellent job of explaining how different translations were developed.  It includes brief samples from lots of different bibles,  including my recommendation - The New Jerusalem Bible.

I hope mine is more informative.<br>  <br>  We have 4 categories to consider here.<br>  a) moderately easy-to-read bibles<br>  b) very easy-to-read bibles<br>  c) extremely easy-to-read bibles<br>  d) paraphrase bibles<br>  <br>  These are in order of preference.  By that I mean:  the more difficult-to-read bible you get, the more precise it is likely to be.  The easier that a bible is to read, the less precise it is likely to be.<br>  <br>  <br>  a) moderately easy-to-read:  generally have a reading level of 7th-9th grade.  I recommend the English Standard Version (evangelical) and New Jerusalem Bible (Catholic).  The NJB is by far the better of the two translations (more accurate), but the ESV is more literal and therefore less accurate but good for original language word study.  The ESV is more similar to the KJV than is the NJB.<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385493207?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwjimpettico-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0385493207" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385493...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195289102?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwjimpettico-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0195289102" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0195289...</a><br>  online<br>  ESV<br>  <a href="http://www.gnpcb.org/esv/browse/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gnpcb.org/esv/browse/</a><br>  NJB<br>  <a href="http://www.catholic.org/bible/" rel="nofollow">http://www.catholic.org/bible/</a><br>  <br>  b) very easy-to-read bibles - reading level from 5th-6th grade.  I recommend the Contemporary English Version - which has won awards for its English language and comes in a "complete" version (with apocrypha)<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/158516173X?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwjimpettico-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=158516173X" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1585161...</a><br>  It also comes in a surprisingly excellent "easy read" study bible (with only 66 books)<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1585160172?ie=UTF8&tag=wwwjimpettico-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1585160172" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1585160...</a><br>  online<br>  <a href="http://www.biblija.net/biblija.cgi" rel="nofollow">http://www.biblija.net/biblija.cgi</a><br>  <br>  c) extremely easy-to-read bibles:  are really designed for children (reading level 3rd to 4th grade), but they are actual translations.  The New Century Version and New International Reader's Version make up this category.  I have not evaluated either of these personally, but have not read anything particularly good about either.<br>  <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/versions/index.php?action=getVersionInfo&vid=78&lang=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.biblegateway.com/versions/ind...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/versions/index.php?action=getVersionInfo&vid=76&lang=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.biblegateway.com/versions/ind...</a><br>  <br>  d) paraphrase bibles - are actually rewrites of the bible.  The idea is the author rewrites the biblical account in a flowing, almost novel-like fashion, frequently using very modern language.  This makes it much easier and less boring to read but much less accurate.  A paraphrase is sort of like a story, where each paragraph of the paraphrase tells you *about* each paragraph in the bible.  The Message appears to be the most popular paraphrase currently available.  I only recommend these for people who are not comfortable with any actual translation.<br>  <a href="http://www.biblegateway.com/versions/index.php?action=getVersionInfo&vid=65&lang=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.biblegateway.com/versions/ind...</a><br>  <br>  Feel free to e-mail me with questions<br>  <br>  Jim|`|WjRqYf6naa	I recommend the English Standard Version, but the NIV is more popular.|`|k7FD3rt5aa	New KJV|`|uAMzmAwaaa	the 2 i prefer are the NIV and NAST, they are both written in pretty modern English and the only real difference is they use different translation techniques so they are worded slightly different though they are both about just as accurate.<br>  <br>  if you can i would get a study bible of either of those versions as a good one not only gives you the verses but also gives you bits of info on the verses.|`|CjRfJbncaa	The New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures <a href="http://www.jw.org/index.html?option=QrYQZRQVNlVlYR" rel="nofollow">http://www.jw.org/index.html?option=QrYQ...</a>  {audio MP3 <br>  <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/e/bible/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/e/bible/index....</a>  {read on-line<br>  <a href="http://www.watchtower.org/e/publications/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtower.org/e/publications...</a>  {printed copy<br>  <br>  Choosing a Modern Translation, consider:<br>   - It Must be Accurate<br>   - The Virtue of Consistency<br>   - Faithful Translation<br>   - Is It a Helpful Translation?<br>  <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050524004052/mysite.wanadoo-members.co.uk/newworldtranslation/choosing.htm" rel="nofollow">http://web.archive.org/web/2005052400405...</a>|`|3DjUX8etaa	I often get asked this question.

And the Bible explains it in Matthew 1:18-25<br>  <br>  "This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit. Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly.<br>  <br>   But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins."<br>  <br>   All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: "The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel"—which means, "God with us."<br>  <br>   When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife. But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus."<br>  <br>  So he had originally wanted to call of the marriage due to what he thought was infidelity, but and angel appeared and told him what was going on. After that, he obviously accepted it.

The prophecy said that he would come from the tribe of Judah, which both Mary and Joseph were.  The prophecy didn't give an exact date of when the messiah would come, but it did give a.... kind of a ballpark range of time when he would appear.  So Joseph would have known to be on the lookout, so to speak.<br>  <br>  When he first found out Mary was pregnant, he did doubt her fidelity.  He planned to quietly break things off with her.  This actually said a lot about his love for her.  Under the law at that time, the punishment for an engaged woman who cheats is to be stoned to death - Joseph didn't want that to happen to her, so he planned to keep everything hush hush.<br>  <br>  He changed his mind about breaking up when an angel appeared to him and confirmed that Mary was telling the truth, she hadn't been unfaithful, and the promised messiah was coming through her.  He was probably pretty excited at this point.  How would you have felt?  Your God had promised a messiah, all the people were anxiously waiting hundreds of years for it, and now, not only is the time finally here, but he's in your house, and your God is trusting YOU AND YOUR WIFE to raise him from infancy.  How awesome is that????<br>  <br>  Jesus, at 12 years old, had extensive knowledge of scriptures, so Mary and Joseph must have made extra sure to teach him all about his purpose.  That's gotta say something about how serious Mary and Joseph took their responsibility.<br>  <br>  Later in Jesus' life he was referred to as "the carpenter" and "the carpenter's son."  So, he was a carpenter, like Joseph.  It was common in those days for a father to teach his son his line of work.  Joseph did this, so he must have been OK with Jesus.  <br>  <br>  He and Mary went on to have at least 6 other children - 4 boys are named in the Bible, and there are at least 2 girls.  Joseph passed away sometime before Jesus did, but the Bible doesn't say exactly when.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!!!|`|2zd9OjeMaa	As an atheist, I can tell you that the text of Matthew says that he was angry at first and was planning to privately divorce her until he had a dream-visit from an angel who explained it to him.

In that culture, you just did not marry a girl if she was not a virgin. It meant a lot more back then. He almost called it off, but was talked into going on with it by an angelic visitation. Still, I can only imagine that he always wondered what the other men of the town thought of him for taking her. It apparently did not kill his reputation, though.|`|AA10460376	I know the story.....Believe me Joseph was not "FEELING" that at all but an Angel of the Lord appeared to JOSEPH and told him what had taken place so JOSEPH calmed down and was obedient to the word of the LORD. He stuck by Mary and after Jesus was born, thereafter, they consemated the marriage and went on to have more children. A little extra history, Mary had a Brother named Lazarus and a Sister named Martha. The stories in the Bible are great reading. I pray that you read some because you will be Abundantly Blessed.!|`|3a3e942c6ad42563faecc58bad4ee235aa	In the beginning, Joseph did not understand and was going to give Mary a divorce.  When the angel of God spoke with him, he no longer seemed to have any doubt.<br>  <br>  Since Joseph was much older than Mary, he probably died while Mary was still young.  There were at least 7 children that Mary had to care for after he must have died.  They were all younger than Jesus, of course, so since Jesus died at about 33 years of age, some were probably still young. <br>  <br>  There is no evidence Joseph ever questioned her nor doubted Mary in any way.<br>  <br>  Mary and Joseph were in a state similar to an engagement in the world today.  They were betrothed for a year before marriage and they did not come together to have sex and consumate the marriage during this year.  According to some sources, Mary probably was serving in the temple at the time she became pregnant.  She was about 13 years of age, or that was the average for the era of time that a lady became a wife.  They were married when the girls were between 12 and 15.  Joseph should have been over 30 years of age at the time of the betrothal.<br>  <br>  Both of the genealogies of Jesus were of the line through Joseph.  Mary was not descended from David, but Joseph was.  Mary was of the lineage of Aaron, the priestly line.  (found in Luke when talking about Elizabeth, Mary's kinds person.)<br>  <br>  Jesus was not the son of Mary of Bethany, whose brother was Lazarus and sister was Martha.  The person reporting this is in error.  The brothers of Jesus were ----      Matthew 13:55   "Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?"|`|au2o1GD5aa	The basic answer, I suppose, is yes. He likely did have such feelings, and was at first of a mind, as the Bible says, "to divorce her privately."<br>  <br>  You can read all about it in Matthew, Chapter 1, beginning with verse 18 (which I'll cut and paste for you):<br>  <br>  18. This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about: His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit. 19. Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly. <br>   20. But after he had considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. 21. She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins." <br>  <br>   22. All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: 23. "The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel" —which means, "God with us." <br>  <br>   24. When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary home as his wife. 25. But he had no union with her until she gave birth to a son. And he gave him the name Jesus.<br>  <br>  <br>  Footnotes:<br>  Matthew 1:21 Jesus is the Greek form of Joshua, which means the LORD saves. <br>  Matthew 1:23 Isaiah 7:14 <br>  <br>  Hope this help you out. It is pointless to say how Joseph "might" have felt. All we have to go on is what the Bible says. But after being visited by the Lord (that is a manifestation of God the Creator of all things), it is reasonable to assume that Joseph was specially chosen for this task (of parenting the God/Man) as was Mary.<br>  <br>  Good question. Hope this helps.

You can imagine how betrayed he felt. Plus, he knew it was not HIS child, so what would this say about the girl of his dreams???<br>  In Matthew's Gospel (ch 1 &2) Joseph was unwilling to expose her to the riggers of what the law suggested (that Mary be stoned to death as unfaithful), so he decided to divorce her quietly (the Jewish Law allowed this loophole). Then in a dream, Joseph was told not to have any fear about taking Mary as his wife. She had conceived through the power of the Holy Spirit. <br>  Notice the beautiful parallel between this Joseph and the Joseph of the Hebrew Scriptures (sometimes called Old Testament). They were both dreamers, that God worked with and worked through.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  Jim|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	yes it did mention to him about not being happy at first but an angel came to him and told him not to worry it was immaculate conversion. i mean there are so many stories out there telling of this. he was alot older then mary in those days that is how it went. she would hvae been stoned if they had found out about her and he kept the child to be his. he was a very descent man. he did not feel robbered or nothing he understood his role and loved her.I am not well educated but a graduate i am not bible scholar but if you would talke to any priest they would talk to long and hard about all this mess.

Perseus (a hero) had to go on a quest to kill the gorgon, Medusa.  When he cut her head off, Pegasus and his brother came out.  He is a winged horse.  Bellerophon (another hero) accidentally killed his brother and so he went to be purified.  The wife of the guy that was purifying him tried to seduce him and when he rejected her, she lied to her husband and sent Bellerophon to die at the hands of the woman's father.  Her father didn't want to kill a hero, so she sent him to kill the Chimera (a beast with the head of a goat, serpent, and a lion).  Bellerophon rode Pegasus to kill the Chimera.  Later Bellerophon tried to ride Pegasus to the gods in heaven, but Pegasus threw him off because people aren't supposed to do that.  So Zeus made Pegasus immortal and used him to carry his thunderbolts.|`|p8RWKtxyaa	well it's a greek myth.<br>  It's heard that pegasus was born when medusa's head was cut off.<br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S. are you choosing a best answer?

NbmnWwqEaa	I do believe in God . . . BUT, I believe in a more metaphysical/New Age approach. And besides the churches teach us that God loves us UNCONDITIONALLY, which means . . . there are no conditions!<br>  <br>  I am not "God fearing" . . .I am "God loving"; we shouldn't fear love; for it is pure and beautiful in this form. Unconditional . . .no conditions, at all.<br>  <br>  Fear human, living people with knives, guns . . . and only when they are coming towards you.<br>  <br>  Love yourself . . . your God . . . and know, if you are generally a good person (and follow the Golden Rule "Do Unto Others As You Would Have Them Do Unto You"). You will do well in this world.<br>  <br>  Of course, you shouldn't kill . . . or cheat on your spouse . . . those are a given. Nevertheless, we are human and make mistakes. And if God loves us unconditionally . . . well . . . <br>  <br>  I will not and do not believe in a God that punishes us with a burning fire and brimstone hell, just because we say a curse word or make a mistake  . . .  any mistake! The love has no conditions.<br>  <br>  Everyone is welcome on the Other Side . .. not just Christians. My Jewish friends, too and my friends of other non-Christian beliefs. For that is unconditional . . .|`|wx2UfKOdaa	absolutely right...|`|SsB7aRExaa	Well, since that is EVERY PERSON WHO HAS EVER LIVED (except Jesus), then every person should fear God.<br>  <br>  "If we say we have no sin, we make Him a liar, and the truth is not in us."|`|J4lfOSPiaa	I do not want to give a flippant answer to this because obviously you have given this some thought.  Christians do believe you should follow the 10 commandments, but it is both simpler and more complicated to answer this fairly. You have read the New Testament in the Bible, correct?  When Jesus gave his life on the cross he opened up a whole new way of thinking.  Jew and Gentile alike were given free will to chose his sacrifice as payment for our sins ergo that is why you see people at sporting events holding up poster board that has John 3:16 written on it.  Basically it asks each individual to repent of sin and accept Jesus Christ as the son of God.  For many people such an easy premise as accepting Christ as Lord and Savior in addition to following the commandments and living a Godly life seems too simple ergo you are branded by some in society as not a free thinker or a sucker!  However when you walk daily with Christ in your heart, I personally think it makes you a better human being in society as a whole, but this is a curbside quick answer to a very difficult question you have asked.  I feel I have failed to give you a 1, 2, 3, easy answer and that is my fault, but this forum is a little more difficult to explain Christian discipleship and often more easy to give a short meaningless answer.  Sorry, but if I were to break it down and answer your fear question, I would have to say that yes a margin of fear would be in keeping with the Christian belief that the only way to receive life eternal is by accepting Jesus as your Savior.  Now Jesus did not come to erase the old laws in the old testament, but to fulfill them, and he says in his teachings so many things like following the commandments plus much, much, more.  The best advice I feel I can give you to help you not fear the coming of Christ is to read Scripture and I am afraid my friend that means the whole Bible! That is a lot of reading but worth the effort!|`|VrRndNVbaa	well...no,you!

This is just what I know to be true. You need to be evaluated to see what sort of speech problem you have. If you have a speech delay, then yes. Speech therapy would help you. If you have a lisp, it may not. In fact I would say no.  The lisp may be something you're stuck with. Make an appointment to see a SLP (Speech & Language Pathologist) and they can make the correct diagnosis and point you in the right direction. Best of luck!|`|X3GGhtWhaa	Well lol that's exactly how i feel about my voice. I've been in speech therapy for as long as i can remember, and I still have my crappy voice.

No you did not cast a spell without knowing it...<br>  In Light... )O(|`|yCTxg4t5aa	Actually you may have. That is all spell casting really is, a physical act that directs you energy at something, though i wouldn't blame yourself for them staying together because spells only work to a certain point, your ex and his partner still have free will, magic cannot take that away from anyone. What it does is like subliminal messages, it puts the thought there but can't MAKE anyone do anything.|`|dFBccLExaa	Still asking this?|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	Well, casting a spell is a deliberate action you take to work magic, so technically you couldn't have "cast a spell without knowing it".<br>  <br>  But did you direct some of your energies to that situation with your thoughts and emotions?  It sure sounds that way.<br>  <br>  I would suggest you study up on karma and what it actually is according to the religions the philosophy originates from, such as Hinduism and Buddhism.

wB3AbJyLaa	First of all, he did create a world where people don't hurt each other. At least, that's what the Bible said things were like at the outset of human history. If God didn't create evil the where did the evil come from? Once God chose to create human beings with free choice, then it was up to them, rather than to God, whether there was evil or not. That's what free choice means. Built unto the situation of God deciding to create human beings is the chance of evil and the suffering that results. Then why didn't God create human beings who were unable to choose to hate, destroy, or do all the other things that cause pain or suffering? Why didn't he create people capable only of being kind and loving? Think of it this way, if you push a button on one of those talking Barbie dolls, and it says, "I love you." how meaningful is that? If love or goodness is something programmed into you, something you have no choice about, is it really love? Real love must involve a choice. Think about your own relationships. God gave people free choice because that's the only way one could experience love, which is the greatest value in the universe, but then humans abused their freedom of choice by rejecting God and walking away from him. And that's how human suffering came into the world. God did not create evil and suffering. Now, it's true that he did create the potential for evil to enter the world, because that was the only way to create the potential for authentic love. But it was human beings, with our free choice, who brought that potential into reality.|`|AA10057370	freewill.<br>  God allows free choice.Each person is responsible for those choices.|`|B7TFX4wUaa	Since he is supposed to be omniscience, yes.|`|uFAoq4idaa	No, God hold Satan responsible for this.

Through everything we do while we're alive. And considering the fact that God is in us and we are in God, accountability becomes very easy to achieve since we are all accountable for our own acts. Maybe not while we're still alive. But eventually, we'll face ourselves and everything good and bad we've done in life. And since God experiences through us...|`|6b24cf642defa808f4e13cc745076453aa	I prefer to leave gods and the supernatural out of it, and take personal responsibility for what I can act on, myself.

In Genesis, when Cain is jealous of G-d's acceptance of Abel's sacrifice but unhappy with his own, He says that Cain can improve and that "Sin crouches at the door yet you can be its master."<br>  <br>  Now, not believing in any such story literally, or being atheist, that people want to use the Bible as an excuse for human's atrocities or as a reason that G-d can't exist but at the same time use science to pardon people of huge atrocities all the time. <br>  <br>  I'm not saying it's INCORRECT, seeing as I believe in science. But we have all sorts of sociological and psychological or physiological methods of explaining how all sorts of tragedies occur. <br>  <br>  It seems like no matter what you do there's some excuse for people being awful to each other.|`|QF4W5aYRaa	No. He loves us so much, He gave us free will. Also, we have the devil, who's job is to "steal, kill, and destroy", which, he does very well. When we sin, we give place, "legal" right to the devil to do his thing in our lives. God holds His Word above His Name, Too many folks are too lazy, blinded, etc., and do not read and study The Word, therefore, it is our own choice, option, fault, etc., that we wind up in the spots and trouble that we do.

FjiRPKp2aa	I am with ya on that toogirl. I am a registered donor|`|5AbCtkWFaa	I have donated blood in the past, and I just did again yesterday after a friend told me about a "snow day" blood drive.

8yE2sYGeaa	We don't.<br>  <br>  keep in mind that the Bible only REPRESENTS the word of God. when was the last time God came down to edit His galleries?<br>  <br>  We are held captive at the whim of people who decide what the Bible is to say|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	Honest theists admit they just believe and not *know* - unless they're delusional and believe their god is talking to them.|`|ZJ2k7Ynqaa	The Bible changed my life. <br>  2 Corinthians 5:17|`|BY02DhfWaa	these people that wrote the bible lived so far apart they could not have compared notes, most of these people that wrote that bible had no schooling. i did have some other notes about the bible and i cant find them if i was a pastor i could help you more but i cant it is hard to explain  i can feel him all around me i can feel him working in me i believe the bible is true because i have faith in GOD my father my creator it is by grace through faith we are saved .|`|OKClYfDQaa	Just one example:<br>  <br>  Job 26:7 - "He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth the earth upon nothing."<br>  <br>  Ask yourself: Correct or wrong?|`|nw0fqXj9aa	<a href="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/donald_morgan/inconsistencies.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/d...</a><br>  <br>  Far from perfect.|`|AA10057370	pray with faith.|`|e834d8db36b13de567ab48eb9cdaf267aa	1.Amazing unity - This book was written by about 40 different men, over a period of 1500 years and it all fits together like a single work.<br>  <br>  2.Prophecies and fulfillment. - There are prophecies known to have been written hundreds of years earlier than they were fulfilled and they all came to pass exactly as prophesied. Many of these prophesies were in great detail.<br>  <br>  3.Scientific foreknowledge. – The Bible is not a book of science, but whenever it mentions something, it is always correct. For example, Moses was raised as an Egyptian and trained in all of their ways. Egyptian medicine called for putting donkey dung and worm blood on sores for healing. Donkey dung carries a high amount of tetnis.<br>  <br>  You would think the things Moses wrote would be along the lines of his Egyptian training, however, the laws in the Bible are drastically different. These books do contain numerous regulations for sanitation, quarantine, and other medical procedures that were to govern the daily lives of the Israelite nation. Missing entirely from the pages of these writings are the harmful remedies and ingredients prescribed by other ancient civilizations. The Bible does not make the mistakes that were made in this area by many ancient civilizations. In fact, the Pentateuch exhibits an understanding of germs and disease that much “modern” medicine did not grasp for 3,500 years after the books were written.<br>  <br>  4.The change exhibited by Biblical characters – Take Paul for example. He went from killing Christians to being one of the most active in promoting Christianity. Many of the earliest Christians were tortured and killed. If the things they taught were not true – just a hoax- then why would they suffer so much for it?<br>  <br>  5.Archeology – No archeological find has ever disproven anything stated in the Bible. Some ridiculed the Bible because it spoke of the Hitite nation and for years there was no record they ever existed, however, in 1906 an extensive library was found that detailed the Hitite history and many details supported things already known from the Biblical record. Some ridiculed because there was no evidence of David and Soloman, but such evidence was discovered in 1993, again proving the Bible was accurate.<br>  <br>  I hope you will look at at least some of the videos and articles at the links below. The video series "Out With Doubt" is excellent!|`|IqqaA2wIaa	CUZ GOD NEVER LIES SO ITS NO PROB FOR US CUZ WE KNOW HIM AND WE HAVE HIS SPIRIT...|`|Rt4bJfVAaa	Well what other book is there for believers to go to?<br>  <br>  Law students get their education from law professors and books.<br>  Medical students were educated with professionals that dealt with taking care of people that needed medical care. (My new wife and daughter are too)<br>  <br>  You name it, teachers of all professions and disciplines have been teaching students from authorized books of education so that the student can start to work in that profession.   And if not work at least be exposed to what goes on and decide they may want another career choice.<br>  <br>  The same is true for politics or philosophy etc etc etc<br>  <br>  Religions that have been spawned in different regions of the world over time have their teachers with their books and its teachings also.<br>  <br>  In all of the other disciplines of man besides the religious ones.  We can choose to accept what is there or deny it.  But to question if it is correct about one main book the Bible is for me is not a common sense arguement.  For if I put this question about this book. Then do I start to question all books of all professions?<br>  <br>  Where do we get our knowledge from if they are not the answers.<br>  <br>  And especially about the Bible.  Whose stories in ancient times were oral before they were written on documents made of God knows what?  Whose stories were not changed because the truth of what was told could not be changed.  Because their knowledge of God would not allow one generation to another generation to another generation forget the knowledge of God.  <br>  <br>  Especially like the Israelites of old.  Their whole drama before the birth of the Messiah is written in the Old Testament before the days of the first wold empire in Iraqi to the time of the Birth of Jesus Christ under the Roman world empire.   <br>  <br>  I can go on but what good are my words.  Really?  When people do not stop to think about how the Bible got here.  When people do not consider the epic stories of true men.  Where the cities and places are mention and proven by archaeology.  When the people are still there from the anscestors.  When the major religions of the world are Christianity, Islam, and Judaism.  <br>  <br>  When I say it is correct.  After 55 years I hope I have given more thought about this that meets some form of intellectual threshold where a reasonable person would say to himself.  Yeah I can understand why it is correct for you.   <br>  <br>  Later.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	I say, "I don't know if the Bible is 'inerrant'."<br>  <br>  But I also don't tell them they have to believe in what I believe.  <br>  <br>  The "Good News" is this: John 3:14-21.  The Good News is NOT this: "There is a hell and you are headed there IF you don't do this."<br>  <br>  If you don't believe in God in the first place, the Good News won't matter to you.  But for those who are spiritually hungry, who are searching for God, living in fear due to their religion, tired of never feeling "righteous enough"...Jesus provides relief.  <br>  <br>   "Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest."  (Matthew 11:28)|`|8pQrIL90aa	When you read the bible it tells you about life. It is relevant even to todays lifestyles.<br>  <br>  Truth is truth. Pray and trust in what you believe.

The Bible is verified, and proven to be the ONLY prophetic book with a 100% track record. The stuff that hasn't happened, hasn't happened-yet! It is not the "fullness" of time-yet. True, pure science validates The Bible at every encounter,, which, isn't hard to figure out, since it was all written in The Bible, before man had a clue. Where do you think man came up with all the ideas to search out?? One other fact, man has NEVER had an original thought. Hmmm!! There are so many, but this is one of my favorites, NASA, using the "laws" of planetary motion, found several historic events which occurred in the past,which, oddly enough, are ONLY documented in the Bible. So, I have no problem showing how The Bible is correct, because it IS!!|`|tOh85To7aa	The Spirit of God in me let's me know the Bible is right,remember Father,Son & Holy Spirit the 3 are one and the Holy Spirit is God's witness.

Once you know God, Jesus Christ thru an intimate relationship, then you have the Holy Spirit indwelling you to show you who God is, to understand His Word and to change you into a new creation. Without the Holy Spirit, all of this seems foolishness to the natural man (scriptural).  Thanks for asking. God bless|`|cn0ALwwLaa	Faith, by definition, is that which cannot be proven.<br>  <br>  Yet we do not dispute the Old Testament. Even the Jews believe it as truth. PS: Jesus made the New Testament his covenant, and the bible is New and Old testament now, not just Old. Jews miss this, as well as certain other control freak basically cults. They refuse to accept Jesus. No basis for this but personal gain.<br>  <br>  THe translations were done to King James because nobody in the new world could read them. Much care was taken to preserve the words. Translations like NIV - New International Version - are marginally acceptable for beginners, but lose meaning. It is still right, though. Just not 100% corect compared to KJV, all the time. (It loses one verse and meaning of actual words. Important in the Bible.)<br>  <br>  <br>  The Bible is right. No contradictions in it. Ask yourself Who is speaking, and WHo is being spoken to, and you can see the 'contradictions' "An Eye For An Eye" = statement by God to Israelites preparing for war vs. "Love thy neighbor as thyself" = Jesus, see?) are not contradictions.<br>  <br>  Those that try to prove it physically are challenged by non-believers. If you accept Jesus of the Bible into your heart, you will be saved.<br>  <br>  All these things come into play in the question.<br>  <br>  As well: Noah's Ark was found on Mounr Ararat. the Government there knows it and tells us to stay away.|`|46zwfDpNaa	This website has some interesting information:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.clarifyingchristianity.com/b_proof.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.clarifyingchristianity.com/b_...</a><br>  <br>  There is actually an entire discipline of Theology called "Apologetics" which deals with intrinsic, as well as empirical evidences for the Bible's veracity.|`|cdFqekzZaa	The bible does not say"the bible is correct."No sir.

9NKUw5cqaa	Wow, sounds like me: Shy, Awkward, Acne, Home schooled. Only I'm working my way through these things. Life always gets me down, and when I think someone is laughing at me, that doesn't help. But don't wish you were dead, and please don't kill yourself. Someone laughing at you really lowers your self esteem and the rest of the world drags you down. I know these qualities of your personality must really be a drag, but there must be something your good for. When I'm down I try to point out all my good qualities. There's always something your good for. Don't let the rest of the world drag you down. When you feel like everyone is laughing behind your back, keep pushing forward. Look at life and everything in it as a game. You can't lose this game. You have to win, even if your shy, you can still do it. I'm shy as hell and I still try my best because I'll never let life win. I'll fight it to the end and I hope that you can to. I've learned to laugh at myself sometimes because we all make mistakes and even though it sucks when it happens, it's can be funny to others, and not funny to you. But sometimes, it helps to laugh at yourself. Ya know, we screw up, make mistakes, we're born goofballs. It's all apart of life. Ignore the mean and wrong people, and keep moving forward.|`|bljEhh86aa	have you ever heard this song:<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHAGdYXZL_s" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHAGdYXZL...</a> wait till the man stop rapping and list to the words.<br>  <br>  also this song she's very good with feeling like this<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw7M25zbxKo" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uw7M25zbx...</a><br>  <br>  eminem is a good person to listen to when you down certain songs of him, find an artist that have your feelings.|`|AA11788494	Yes.  People will always do that.  We all laugh at someone at times.  Some people do it to be mean and others make fun of fools.  There is a difference.|`|EwUcmfoFaa	I was the same way, then I accepted the fact that not everyone will like me. Try not to take things literally, because especially your family is not laughing to try and hurt you. And don't wish you were dead! I felt that way at one point, but after it passed I was so glad I did nothing reckless. As you go on through life, your social skills will improve, dont worry! And anyone who does laugh at you intending to be mean, they arent worth your time so forget them.|`|qK91Vd2Eaa	I think your just paranoid and that's probably because you haven't been around a lot of people you may have serious social issues you should talk to a professional about it work that out and be joking whn you say you wish you were dead life gets better trust me you just have to way make it better talk to someone please!|`|vg9OYsKFaa	i always feel like people laugh at me but at least u are being paid attention to. maybe u should try doing some activity where u can be around people. im very antisocial but im gettin over it too. i know how u feel when u say u wish u were dead but i now know thats not the way to go. never think that of yourself. and sometimes u might think people are laughinat you but u are so insecure of yourself that u can be imagining it. keep your head up and talk to someone. im sure if your family loves u they would not laugh at you. and if they do let them know how u feel.|`|QHBuH39jaa	I dunno, some people dont and some people do.

nBERj16Eaa	To me,<br>  belief is not a matter of choice,<br>  .<br>  it is a matter of DISCOVERY.<br>  <br>  <br>  We use the word "choice" here in the USA,<br>  I think, because we pride ourselves on having freedom of choosing where we worship.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  Jim|`|O7w6XGqPaa	That is why it is called faith. It is not a choice at all.<br>  Many believers think they made a choice,  because otherwise they would have to admit that their beliefs are not a choice at all but a mere accident of birth and parental upbringing which in turn depend on accidents of history. The rationale of choice is why they think God can justly punish wrong  belief, as if folks in China or India or Iran had much choice in the matter.<br>  <br>  Many countries in Asia and Africa are Muslim because of conquest. Others are Catholic because of choices made by dynasts who wanted to accede to thrones. The dukes of Lithuania famously converted to Catholicism so that they could inherit the vacant crown of Poland. After the Thirty Years' War, each German prince decided which religion his state would follow.  The conquistatdors made Latin America Catholic.<br>  <br>  Choice has very little to do with it. In many countries, no choice is possible. It is illegal to proselytize in Muslim countries for Islam or to proselytize Jews in Israel to give up Judaism. In Muslim countries, changing religions if apostasy, a capital crime. Even in the West, most folks have little opportunity to change religions, never getting a fair explanation of their differing doctrines. <br>  <br>  Mostly it is for social or psychological reasons. A Jew marries a Christian and agrees to convert to the faith of his prospective wife. Naturally he does not demand proof of the new doctrines he is supposed to accept. He may take a course for converts but the outcome his already decided. He does not convert because of evidence. Indeed he decides to accept a new faith not only without evidence but even before he really knows what those beliefs really are.|`|ETZbKDOqaa	Because belief is a matter of choice.

You truth is only long as you are alive, it is not eternal nor does it spawns the births of new suns, nor can it even extend your very life.

Your truth cannot stop anything that will take place after your life on earth has expired.<br>  <br>  Truth is, there is but one truth, yet the world loves many options. Gays blame God but why not Satan? You see how it works? Your truth cannot create nothing, nor does your truth have power. Gods truth is given to those who believe, and his truth endures. You are trying to explain what is spiritual with carnal eyes. You are trying to be GOD by declaring that there is no GOD.<br>  <br>  God made choice, and the devil gives you options.|`|kkO87h0Xaa	Choosing not to believe in either/something is also a choice, btw.

My entire belief system hinged on your opinion *snickers*|`|rz4AUvbaaa	nope  :)|`|7mhRDbvsaa	tell me something that i don't know|`|XN0cYCATaa	Sometimes atheist assert that there is no proof that God exists.  The only problem is that an atheist cannot logically make that claim.<br>  <br>  In order to state that there is no proof for God's existence, the atheist would have to know all alleged proofs that exist in order to then state that there is no proof for God's existence.  But, since he cannot know all things, he cannot logically state there is no proof for God's existence.<br>  <br>  At best, an atheist can only state that of all the alleged proofs he has seen thus far, none have worked.  He could even say that he believes there are no proofs for God's existence.  But then, this means that there is the possibility that there is a proof or proofs out there and that he simply has not yet encountered one.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, if there was a proof that truly did prove God's existence, would the atheist be able to accept it given that his presuppositions are in opposition to the existence of God?  In other words, given that the atheist has a presuppositional base that there is no God, in order for him to accept a proof for God's existence, he would have to change his presuppositional base.  This is not easy to do and would involve a major paradigm shift in the belief structure of the atheist.  Therefore, an atheist is presuppositionally hostile to any proofs for God's existence and is less likely to be objective about such attempted proofs.<br>  <br>  <br>  Now consider yourself defeated|`|jFqWYC4uaa	I am not sure about god.

It doesn't have to be some big web of lies and misery.<br>  <br>  If you feel that you're the type who can love more than one person at the same time, or that situation is popping up, you need to make sure that you are honest with yourself and everyone involved. Communication is key to having a relationship with more than one person, and sometimes it takes a while to find the right people to live that sort of a life with you... but it's worth the wait.<br>  <br>  Cheers, and don't let people tell you it's wrong.|`|gspTDufpaa	Yes that happens all the time.

There was a great variety of scripture written about Jesus; the current Bible is a selection of those parts, combined with the Old Testament...which is itself a selection of Hebrew scripture.  Most of this was rejected from the Bible because it was just repetitive.  Some was fragmentary - only parts survived.  Some conflicted with accepted facts, or was contradictory with the intentions of the Bible. (eg., The longest scripture not in the Bible - The Gospel of Thomas - has no crucifixion, and portrays Jesus as over-demanding, some say 'downright mean.')<br>  <br>  What else do they say?  The MOST IMPORTANT things they say are Christian beliefs that are not included in the Bible, such as the names of the three Magi.<br>  <br>  (The 'missing parts' should not be confused with the Apocrypha - THese are the parts of the Catholic Bible, that were taken out of the Protestant Bible by Martin Luther.)<br>  <br>  A good introduction to this topic is 'THe Lost Bible', a brief book (under 200 pages) well-illustrated with famous art; which discusses the 'missing' parts of both the Old and New Testament.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=The+Lost+BIble&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=com.ubuntu:en-US:unofficial&client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.ca/search?q=The+Lost+B...</a>|`|ZYrQXiwBaa	Thousands of books written by early christians where not added to the Bible.|`|d529cebfe13576f3ddee3e55b4cd08ffaa	I've heard that there are many 'books' that were kept out of it.

The texts are of great religious and historical significance, as they include some of the only known surviving copies of Biblical documents made before 100 C.E., and preserve evidence of considerable diversity of belief and practice within late Second Temple Judaism. They are written in Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek, mostly on parchment, but with some written on papyrus. These manuscripts generally date between 150 B.C.E. to 70 C.E.

Aa6XHuENaa	It sounds like you're agnostic<br>  <br>  Agnosticism is the philosophical view that the truth value of certain claims — particularly metaphysical claims regarding theology, afterlife or the existence of deities, ghosts, or even ultimate reality — is unknown or, depending on the form of agnosticism, inherently impossible to prove or disprove. It is often put forth as a middle ground between theism and atheism, though it is not a religious declaration in itself. Agnosticism does not preclude religious belief; that is to say, an agnostic can be a theist or an atheist, but can be 'agnostically' so.|`|FmazIF6Maa	Belief is not a choice... you sound agnostic to me. A lot of Pagans/Wiccans are agnostic and it's perfectly acceptable in those faiths. <br>  <br>  Also, Unitarian Universalists can be agnostic-- or atheist, or Wiccan, or liberal Christians and Jews, or Buddhists.

He is the Sustainer of all creations. The universe is one of the most outstanding witnesses to Allah's existence. How many starts, in all, are there? How far away is the farthest star? Is there any end at all to space?  Astronomers say that Earth is one part of a Galaxy that is known as the Milky Way.  About one million galaxies are detectable through a large and powerful telescope.  The sun is only a medium sized star; yet its diameter is 109 times greater than that of earth.  Then there are numerous comets, meteors, shooting starts and planets.<br>  <br>  The Earth orbits the sun at an average distance of 150 million km.  Pluto's distance from the sun is the greatest --more than 5 1/2 billion km.  You know that light travels at 1,86,000 miles per second.  Even at that speed, it takes eight minutes for the sun' light to reach Pluto.  Still the scientists are learning mor and more every year about the universe.  Not until 1930 did anyone know for certain about the existence of the planet Pluto.  Scientists still guess at the limits of the space.  It has, in fact, no end!  Have all these things come about by mere chance?  No, never, it is all Allah's doing.  A study of the creations of Allh compels one to believe in His Might and Majestry.  The signs of Allah are manifest everywhere in the nature.  The Holy Qur'an reveals that: "Really in the creation of the heaven and the earth, and in succession of night and day, there are indeed messages for men of understanding, who remember Allah; when they stand, and when they sit, and when they lie down to sleep and thus relect on the creation of the heavens and the earth."<br>  <br>  The greatest of all nature's wonders is our own body.  Allah has made us in the best shape.  In fact, Allah made man so special that there is nothing more wonderful than he on earth.  Just consider!  Our body is composed of bones and muscles -- of a number of highly complicated systems: the digestive system, the blood circulation system, the respiratory system, the nervous system etc.  Just think about<br>  the human ear.  A part of it is a series of some four thousand minute and complex arches.  Our brain contains 10 billion cells.  It communicates with the rest of the body through millions of nerve tracks.  Can you think of something more wonderful than man on earth?  From what source could come so perfect, mathematically precise, an order?<br>  <br>  The keys of life and death are in Allah's hand.  Man's power is nothing.  Time is nothing to Allah.  He exists.  He is One.  He Alone is the Creator, Lord, Master and Ruler.  The universe exists because Allah wills it to exist.  He views the whole universe.  He Alone is truly Wise, All-aware.  He commands the whole creation.  He grants life and deals death.  He has full knowledge of everything.  He has no 'past' nor 'future', the Most High, the Most Near.  He has been there always and will be there always.  Whatever exists besides Him is His own creation.  He Alone is eternally Present.  He is the Master of man's destiny.  No one can interfere with his fate or with the fate of others.  He responds to man's prayers.  He Alone has the power to accept or reject them.  Man's hopes and fears, therefore, must be directed to Him Alone.  Therefore, the most fundamental thing in Islam is the kalima (words), "Lailaha Illallahu, Muhammadu Rasulullah<br>  There is no diety worthy of worship except Allah and Mohammed (peace be upon him) is His slave and Messenger".<br>  <br>  Allah sent more than one lakh Messengers/Prophets to earth. Adam (peace be upon him) the first man on earth was the first Prophet.  There after Allah sent Prophets to all parts of the world from time to time.  Prophet Mohammed (peace be upon him) is the last Prophet and there is no Prophet after him.  He was sent to this world when the human race was in its peak.  He is a perfect model to human being to follow till the day of judgment.|`|xZet9Dunaa	Read Catechism of the Catholic Church.

And I know women and girls I have never seen in a dress--mostly sweats or shorts. <br>  <br>  I was shocked the first time I saw people going to a Catholic church in shorts and sandals. <br>  <br>  We like to go to better restaurants and even there, people next to us are often in jeans and sportswear.  It takes the class out of a fine meal. <br>  <br>  You didn't mention cussing and swearing, but that is so out of line nowadays. I am sure glad I don't have kids in public hearing this stuff or I'd have to hurt people--especially language in music blaring from cars and people who can't say a sentence without several F-words in it,|`|vxeMZXrgaa	~continue to be respectful. yes, our society is too laid back.

Nothing someone as polite as you are should worry about. I agree that our society is getting sloppy. People walking around slouching and at school I see a lot of student going against dress code during free periods. It's sad to see our country slowly turn into what I would call a 'lower class'.

If you want more formal, polite conversation, find group who talks that way.|`|GqfiRXu3aa	I don't think society is too informal.  Many offices now have business casual dress codes.  It's so much nicer and comfortable wearing khakis and a button shirt rather than a suit (and so much cheaper!).<br>  <br>  As far as calling people "sir" or "ma'am" most people today just weren't raised to address people in that way.  Those terms were popular back in the days of "Leave it to Beaver."  The only exception I can think of is when you're asking for help in a store and trying to get someone's attention.  And in those occasions I would say, "Excuse me, Miss" (not "ma'am) and I have said, "Excuse me, Sir," but that's the extent of it.<br>  <br>  That said, I think people are much ruder today and don't care.|`|qL3dGTXDaa	I would consider porn as a truth to your question.

Ong8SIijaa	Peter was neither first pope,nor bishop of rome.Early church never had a pastor who was in charge of more than one church.Each local church was led by group of pastors and deacon and every church was fully autonomous.The early church never interceded to saints or used statues/images(idols) in prayer and worship.Jesus was their only intercessor.Women were not allowed to have authority over men and was not allowed to teach men be it in church or in socio-political setting which is in sharp contrast to what we see in modern protestant churches.There women wore modest clothes unlike in modern churches.Only men were allowed to become pastors and deacons and they wore clothing was not in priestly garb but same as that of common man.All this was changed when constantine made christianity a royal religion.Many pagans entered church without knowledge of jesus,they only wanted money and power.They 'christened' their old pagan idols into jesus,mary,joseph and many others.Thus catholicism was born.They wanted power for this posts of bishop,pope and vatican and many monasteries were started in the old pagan fashion.The only good thing they did was they didn't give women authority.But catholics used feminism to impose this ungodly practice of women teaching and having authority over man,to destroy protestant churches.Look at the state of protestant churches in many traditional protestant countries,they succumbed to feminist lie of catholic church,imposed on them by suffragist and feminist movments by free mason and jesuit secret agents and are today dying off.Jesus asked us to be clever against the tactics of devil.Women teaching and having authority over men can lead to a whole lot of sexual perversions including homosexuality and bdsm.Many protestant nations have a history of female authority right from the start like queens of england,denmark etc.This surely has a negative effect on the sexual health of those communities.|`|2hX0tLzIaa	I belive people met in houses as opposed to actualy chuches.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that the Romans where agaist christainity ( and catholics) and fed christains to the lions.|`|YnGIccE8aa	Answers with evidence?

XN0cYCATaa	What does the Bible say about homosexuality?<br>  There are those who like to say that the Bible does not condemn homosexuality.  Various verses are cited (out of context) and the verses that people use to show that homosexuality is wrong are explained away.  The world wants to change God's words and meanings into something more suitable to its sinful desires.  Nevertheless, the truth stands:  The Bible condemns homosexuality as a sin. Let's look at what it says.<br>  <br>  Lev. 18:22, "You shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination."1 <br>  <br>  Lev. 20:13, "If there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act; they shall surely be put to death. Their bloodguiltness is upon them" <br>  <br>  1 Cor. 6:9-10, "Or do you not know that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, 10nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, shall inherit the kingdom of God." <br>  <br>  Rom. 1:26-28, "For this reason God gave them over to degrading passions; for their women exchanged the natural function for that which is unnatural, 27and in the same way also the men abandoned the natural function of the woman and burned in their desire toward one another, men with men committing indecent acts and receiving in their own persons the due penalty of their error. 28And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer, God gave them over to a depraved mind, to do those things which are not proper."<br>  <br>  Homosexuality is clearly condemned by the Bible.   It goes against the created order of God.  He created Adam and then made a woman.  This is what God has ordained and it is what is right.  Unlike other sins, homosexuality has a severe judgment administered by God Himself. This judgment is simple: They are given over to their passions. That means that their hearts are allowed to be hardened by their sins (Romans 1:18ff). As a result, they can no longer see the error of what they are doing. Without an awareness of their sinfulness, there will be no repentance and trusting in Jesus. Without Jesus, they will have no forgiveness. Without forgiveness, there is no salvation.<br>  <br>  What should be the Christian's Response to the Homosexual?<br>  Just because someone is a homosexual does not mean that we cannot love him (or her) or pray for him (her). Homosexuality is a sin and like any other sin, it needs to be dealt with in the only way possible. It needs to be laid at the cross, repented of, and never done again.<br>  <br>  As a Christian, you should pray for the salvation of the homosexual the same you would any other person in sin. The homosexual is still made in the image of God -- even though he is in grave sin.  Therefore, you should show him same dignity as anyone else you come in contact with. However, this does not mean that you are to approve of their sin. Don't compromise your witness for a socially acceptable opinion that is void of godliness.|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	It's no sin and there is no need to "repent" any more than people with green eyes need to repent for that.<br>  <br>  <br>  The bible was written in an age where tribe size was of the utmost importance. All sexual energy was directed towards filling women with babies as early and as often as possible; all other sexual behavior was criminalized.<br>  <br>  It was a practical matter, and had nothing to do with morality. In fact, quite the contrary; homosexuality isn't immoral - it hurts nobody. Homophobia hurts and sometimes kills - that's what's immoral.<br>  <br>  Christians can't reconcile the idea of a fair god with those barbaric laws, so they have to pretend that homosexuality is an immoral act (it isn't), a choice (it isn't - if you think it is, can you tell me about when you made the choice?), and unnatural (it's not - it's observed in many animal species).<br>  <br>  You could argue that in today's overpopulated world, heterosexuality should be the 'sin'.<br>  <br>  P.S. When the priests came to arrest Jesus, a young man who was with him dropped his linen cloth and "fled from them naked" (Mark 14:51-52). Need I say more?|`|c0KKHMsAaa	right next to the part where is says shrimp and poly-cotton fibers are bad|`|TyRfv0eoaa	In the Hebrew and Greek Bible, there is no actual mention of homosexuality. There is a record of same-sex marriage, but it doesn't go into sexual details. There is one place where it deals with people who ignore their innate sexual orientation in order to be what their society wanted them to be, and it was called an error.<br>  <br>  English Bibles, on the other hand, are a whole different ballgame. Depending on the translation, you'll have homosexual rape in Sodom, Sodomites in Israel, gay men being murdered under the Law, effeminacy and homosexuality given as reasons for people not getting into the Kingdom of Heaven. But none of that nonsense is in the Hebrew and Greek.|`|MeFeazFiaa	Don't know.  Don't care.  All I know is the buy bull is a book compiled from the plagiarised texts of ancient religions by bronze age sheep herders; edited by the Catholic Church and translated  and re-edited in the rule of King James.<br>  <br>  Xtians hate homosexuality because the main character in their fictional buy bull was probably gay.|`|oihouY7Naa	You shall not lie with a male as with a woman. It is an abomination. (NKJ, Leviticus 18:22)<br>  <br>      If a man lies with a male as he lies with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination. They shall surely be put to death. Their blood shall be upon them. (NKJ, Leviticus 20:13)<br>  <br>  ----<br>  It seems to me christians can't face the holy words coming out of their bible.|`|Aa6XHuENaa	In Leviticus, three lines away from where it says that we should stone disobedient children to death<br>  <br>  My interpretation?<br>  <br>  When the bible was written, herd size (for lack of a better term) was of the utmost importance.  The Old Testament laws reflect this.  They are not "moral" or "divine" guides for how man should live, but rather guidelines aimed at promoting a fruitful and stable society.  <br>  <br>  Think about it, two men in a monogamous relationship with one another does nothing to increase the following of your church, right?<br>  <br>  So when a church is in its infancy, it doesn't make any sense for them to condone such a relationship, as it in no way benefits the group, and the survival of the religion.   The same is true about the public stoning of disobedient children.  While at first it seems counter-intuitive to increasing "herd size," you have to keep in mind that this punishment was rarely carried out.  It served as a reminder of who was in charge of the family, and promoted stability by encouraging young people to not speak out against their fathers.<br>  <br>  Now we live in a time where the earth is overpopulated and "herd size" is not a concern.  The laws of Leviticus are woefully outdated and do not serve the purposes of today's society.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	if he repents which means has a change of heart, mind and actions then yes they can go to heaven.

Read 1 Corinthians 3:16; 6:18; and Romans 1:27. Very clear, plain, and to the point. God knows your heart, if you know The Word, you would not behave in such a manner, providing you want to go to heaven. God holds His Word above His Name.Remember, the job of the devil on earth is to "steal, kill, and destroy". When you sin, and live in sin, you give place or "legal" right to the devil to mess with your life.Why do you think that there are so many "incurable" sexually transmitted diseases??

Alexander the Great was not a Greek. He was just an Albanian. Albanians at dhat time were callet Illiryans, and Masedonians were just one of so called, tribes of Illyrian people. The Hunza people are descendants of about 6000 Illyria (Albanian) soliders who were dividet from the Illyrian army whiq was led from dhe Alexandre the Grate, because off the conflict between Alexandre and Kliti, which result with the killing of Kliti, and then dhose who were angry about that walket away from the army.<br>  So if you want to now about those people, I sugest You to compare their language with the Albanian language, because there is no ather explanation.<br>  <br>  There is still a tribe in north Albania called Kalash. Kala in Alb means castle. <br>  <br>  It is true that some soldier veterans of Alexander the great decided to remain in that part of the world. They married local girls and their descendands are the Kalash tribe. There are some other tribes that also descend from Alexanders soldiers, like Burusho. <br>  <br>  I found it so interesting when I listened to the story of Alexander told by the Kalash member. He was talking about Iskander Azem (Alexander the Great). <br>  <br>  Albanian National hero is also called Iskander (Skender-beg)<br>  <br>  But, what really striked me was the god the Kalash believe. That is di ZAU. Basically ZA is a north albanian for ZE=voice from which ZE+greek particle US becomes ZEUS. Instead of ZEUS, the Kalash believe in his brother ZAU, again the northen albanian for SOUND. <br>  <br>  I looked at the Kalash dictionary and found few words that are instantly recognized by albanians. <br>  <br>  KALASH-ENGLISH-ALBANIAN<br>  <br>  TAT-Father-AT<br>  NAN-Mother-NANA<br>  THUL-Fat-TUL<br>  TU-You-TI<br>  UGH-Water-UJE<br>  WAKHT-A time-VAKT<br>  TAZA-Fresh-TAZE<br>  TAN-One's own-TEND(south)TAN(north)<br>  TABUT-Coffin-TABUTI<br>  PI-Drink-PI, <br>  KUY-Where-KU<br>  DUKAN-Shop-DYQAN|`|RgymoiIQaa	No, they do not look white.

These are white pakistanis, but they are minority.|`|msNXomjTaa	Technically, there are three races: Caucasoid (white), Negroid (black), and Mongoloid (Oriental).  <br>  <br>  Some recognize Australian Aboriginals and North American natives as sub-races (along with a few others).<br>  <br>  So, Arabs, Indians from India, Pakistanis, etc., are all "white," in that they are not black or Oriental.  White is the only other choice.<br>  <br>  Clearly, they tend to be browner in Pakistan than in Western Europe, and some would have South Asians and Arabs as a sub-grouping of white (as would be Western Europeans, and others).<br>  <br>  So, by this definition, the kids are definitely white.|`|PM32r1rPaa	They definitely look Caucasian, but probably not European.  As a group, I would guess that they look Middle Easter (i.e. Iranian, Iraqi, etc.). Middle Easterners (Iran, Iraq, etc), North Africans (Morroco, Libya, Algeria, etc) and South Asians (Indians, Pakistanis, etc) are ussually considered Caucasian, but not White. Whereas, Europeans, are considered to be both White and Caucasian. I don't think they can pass as European, except maybe one or two of the people in the group could pass as Southern European (Spaniard, Greek, Italian, etc). Overall, though they do not look like White Europeans, they look Middle Eastern to me.|`|4sh2oRR7aa	Pakistani people are a caucasian race. They're white. They're the same ethnic group.

Totally fair and just. Not us. No church I've been in has denied a gay to enter and hear the message. However, an actively gay person cannot be involved in the functioning of the church. Only a participant to hear the message, get prayer, talk, and things like that. There are even many straights that are not allowed to be part of the "body" until their sin is confessed and they commit to abstinence. After a commitment, anyone could be given an opportunity to serve.|`|b1b878f58acc81bc1bb563fc7ab6432caa	Anyone may come to my church.

They have paid their debt to society, and are free to attend a church.<br>  But if a homosexual comes in, then he or she must be identifying himself/herself as such to be rejected. <br>  <br>  Keep it under your hat, rather than announce it publicly. Why would someone take on the identity of their sin, unless they were happy and proud about it.|`|50c1d92064fa2b7852c7d54f841b22d9aa	As Christians it is their moral duty to save all souls. Ex cons have already paid their debt and if they're attending church have probably "made amends with God." If a church as a whole feels that homosexuality is a sin then being in love is a continuation of that sin. If you never turn from a sin then you can not come to Christ. However lots of churches are waking up and realizing that being Gay isn't a sin it's just another person. <br>  God is the finial judge according to the bible, but people forget that sometimes and try to sort things out themselves. There is always a community of faith out there that is the right fit. For many people it may be the church you mentioned (though don't like or agree with their practices as you say they are) but for many others the right community is elsewhere. Don't worry about those who don't accept and try to find the right fit.|`|nzdDdKtyaa	If a person has repented of their sins and walks the righteous path, there is no reason to deny them a church.<br>  <br>  However, churches cannot accept a person who knowingly and willfully lives a publicly sinful lifestyle.|`|Mwo1CNGRaa	The Church is open to all. <br>  Yes, God is the the Judge and HE is Just.<br>  Everyone is welcome to the house of God. <br>  <br>  Yes, we are all sinners, but it is about making a choice to keep sinning or to turn away from sin.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Another example:<br>  <br>  -What is blasphemy against the Spirit?<br>  Jesus gave solemn warning in these verses to people whose hard-heartedness placed them on the brink of disaster. Blasphemy against the Spirit evidently is not just a one-time offense; rather, it is an ongoing attitude of rebellion - a stubborn way of life that continually resists, rejects and insults God's Spirit. This is what makes it, in effect, an eternal sin (Mark 3:29).<br>  <br>  Some other helpful hints to keep in mind:<br>  (1) Mark notes that Jesus gave this teaching because his opponents claimed he had an evil spirit (Mark 3:30). The Pharisees were so hard-hearted that they could observe the miraculous works of God's Son and then accuse him of being Satan's co-worker -- a tragic calloused contradiction of the truth.<br>  (2) Many people expressed honest uncertainty about Jesus during his earthly ministry because his identity as the Messiah only gradually dawned on them. Words spoken against the Son of Man could therefore be forgiven. Since the day of Pentecost however, the Holy Spirit's ongoing ministry through the revealed Word offers people the opportunity to repent and accept the gospel. Thus, to blaspheme the Holy Spirit is to reject all that God is doing to bring us to salvation through Christ. <br>  (3) Blasphemy against the Spirit is not unforgivable because of something done unintentionally in the past, but because of something being done deliberately and unrelentingly in the present.<br>  Jesus' warning was motivated by love. If we are willing to repent,<br>  God is willing to forgive (1 John 1:9).<br>  <br>  -1 John 1:9 <br>  9If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.<br>  <br>  <br>  Scripture:<br>  <br>  -James 5:20<br>  remember this: Whoever turns a sinner from the error of his way will save him from death and cover over a multitude of sins.<br>  <br>  -John 3:20-21<br>  20Everyone who does evil hates the light, and will not come into the light for fear that his deeds will be exposed. 21But whoever lives by the truth comes into the light, so that it may be seen plainly that what he has done has been done through God."<br>  <br>  -Acts 3:19<br>  Repent, then, and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped out, that times of refreshing may come from the Lord,<br>  <br>  -1 Corinthians 15:34<br>  Come back to your senses as you ought, and stop sinning; for there are some who are ignorant of God—I say this to your shame.<br>  <br>  -1 John 3:9<br>  9No one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God's seed remains in him; he cannot go on sinning, because he has been born of God.<br>  <br>  -1 John 5:18<br>   18We know that anyone born of God does not continue to sin; the one who was born of God keeps him safe, and the evil one cannot harm him.|`|N53y9qohaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  The Church may well disagree with all these sins but all the sinners are welcome in their eyes.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  <br>  Michael Kelly|`|Jt565VJxaa	Because God loves all those things.

Only Christ is able to do and has done that. I assume you mean people who are gay and don't have a problem with that. Repentant sinners are welcome, yes, even gay people are welcome at church. The difference is: repentant sinners have faith; unrepentant gay people don't. Unrepentant gay people and every other unrepentant sinner have essentially said to God that they don't care what His Law says. Notice that in I Corinthians 6:9-10, St. Paul makes no distinction between the different types of sins in the list. Murderers are not specifically mentioned in the list but St. John tells us that murderers are deserving of eternal death (I John 3:15).<br>  <br>  One may say "Jesus never said anything about homosexuality." One should not argue such, because it is an argument from silence that is not backed up otherwise. Jesus never said anything about bestiality either. Does that make it okay? I don't think so.<br>  <br>  Christ has told us that He will send the Holy Spirit to remind us of everything He taught. (John 14:25) Sts. Paul, John, Luke, Matthew, Mark, James, and possibly someone else (book of Hebrews) wrote the New Testament. They were sent by God to record what He wanted them to record. Nothing is irrelevant. <br>  <br>  There are three types of Law: Civil, Ceremonial, and Moral. Only the last is in effect for today (Colossians 2:16-17). The civil law is no longer in effect because the nation of Israel (as it originally was) no longer exists. (The current state of Israel is not the same Israel in the Old Testament.) Both the Civil and Ceremonial Laws were in place to picture the coming Messiah. Since the Messiah has come, it no longer is needed. The Moral Law, however is God's will for all people. (Romans 13:8-10) <br>  <br>  Yes, God will judge us, based on our lives. Christians merely point out what God says. The Law condemns us. It shows us that we are sinners. The Gospel shows us that a Savior has paid the price required of those sins. Christ has done it all to appease God's anger toward mankind. Those ex-convicts and murderers have heard the Law. They have seen their sin. They realize that Christ has paid for it all. The unrepentant sinner has not or refuses to hear God's Law. They don't understand the Gospel. Christ died for them, but they refused. My prayer is that the Holy Spirit works in the hearts of all people to enlighten them with His gifts of faith and eternal life.|`|xwjmBLbiaa	1 Corinthians 5:9 - 9?In my letter I wrote YOU to quit mixing in company with fornicators, 10?not [meaning] entirely with the fornicators of this world or the greedy persons and extortioners or idolaters. Otherwise, YOU would actually have to get out of the world. 11?But now I am writing YOU to quit mixing in company with anyone called a brother that is a fornicator or a greedy person or an idolater or a reviler or a drunkard or an extortioner, not even eating with such a man. 12?For what do I have to do with judging those outside? Do YOU not judge those inside, 13?while God judges those outside? “Remove the wicked [man] from among yourselves. see 1 Corinthians 6:9,10 also.<br>  <br>  (quit mixing in company with anyone called a "brother") the brother in this case must be a dedicated babtised worshipper of God. This is reasonable because Paul said "not entirely with the fornicators of this world or the greedy persons and extortioners or idolaters. Otherwise, YOU would actually have to get out of the world."  <br>  <br>  So this brother must be a dedicated servant of God in which case if he practices the sins mentioned is really not pleasing God and could corrupt the other members of the congregation.

Conversely, I have met people of many faiths and I have found Mormons to be the best example of Christian living of any religion out there.   From a social perspective, I think these people do an incredible job of raising their children.   If I had to make a hiring decision, I’d probably give some preference to the group.  They are hard working, totally honest, and completely dependable.  More than any Christian group, the Mormons live out their faith.  And I think statistics (for example, on divorce and drug use) would back me up.<br>  <br>  I’m not too worried about the Mormons going to Hell.  As long as they have a personal faith in Jesus Christ (and Christ alone) they will be in Heaven.  When I talk to Mormons, that’s what I focus on.<br>  <br>  One key thing I like about the Mormons is that they value higher education and the acquisition of new languages.  They also are pretty open-minded.   They will honestly consider opposing viewpoints.

Even to Jesus Christ.|`|3624c3f93031a4b0388f2bb2bf751883aa	There are plenty of books on this in the local Christian book store.<br>  There are Christians who go to the Mormon Church. But that is because they are being disobedient Christians.<br>  The Mormon foundational doctrines are skewed so they don't actually get saved at that Church. They are more a pre-Christian. Disciples of Christ, but prevented from receiving the 'gift' of Salvation (through being born of His Spirit, cleansed by His blood). To believe that Jesus shed blood is sufficient for our salvation. He paid a high price.<br>  For those who find this difficult to believe & believe instead that Jesus shed blood isn't sufficient alone for salvation, the Mormon Church is for them. So they can add works to attain salvation after they realized that Jesus died on the cross so they could be saved, if they do all they can do.<br>  <br>  The religion/Church, itself isn't Christian. Because it preaches a different Gospel than the One that is in the Holy Bible.<br>  So their way of salvation is to be baptized into their church & do all they can do to then earn salvation<br>  It is written in the Holy Bible, that if someone preaches a different Gospel or has a different Jesus or has a different Holy Spirit, let them be anathema, separate from God.<br>  <br>  Christians who have been saved in a Christian Church and are born again, sealed of the Holy Spirit unto the Day of Redemption, the Holy Spirit shows them the error of the Mormon Doctrines. The Holy Spirit won't let me leave my Church to go to their Church. I would disobey God if I would do that.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also they think that to be saved you have to be baptized into their Church. So they do baptisms for the dead, for those who die & was never baptized into their Church (They believe their Church is the only right Church with the right authority to do water baptisms. So baptisms in any other Church doesn't count.). <br>  If a family member requests a name (of their loved one who died) for baptism; Then the soul in hades has an oportunity to receive Mormons baptizing for them to be saved then. This is dead works.<br>  <br>  <br>  Their Trinity view is scewed. They believe Elohim is the Father. Jehovah is Jesus. The Holy Spirit is Gabriel. And Jesus is first born son of God in pre spirit form.<br>  Actually, Our Creator is God the Father, Word & Holy Spirit. In the beginning, Jesus is the Word of God. Not one of the Sons of God.  Sons of God were a reference to Holy Angels. And 1/3 of these sons of God rebelled. God the Father, Word & Holy Spirit is the LORD God (Yahweh Elohim) who created the Holy Angels (who have wings). Mormons don't believe Angels have wings.<br>  Jesus is the Word of God in the beginning. Not one of the sons of God.|`|oVHFz52Laa	No, they are NOT Christians if they do not believe in Trinity.

This DOES NOT MEAN you have to let him back into your life, but as long as you're carrying anger about your issues with him around with you, HE IS in your life, whether physically present or not.  The reason to forgive people who transgress against you is not altruistic, it is self protection.  As long as you hold the grudge, you are granting an unworthy person power over a part (however small) of your life.  Generally, these people are not worth nursing a smoldering anger for.  Forgive him, but the move on, once you've established the boundaries.|`|f3nwI8ytaa	You can go to church without forgiving your brother.  But if you decide to become christian, you will have to.

5yFnjp56aa	No, It is a unique religion. There is no mention of Jesus in Sikh Scriptures. Sikhs do not believe in idol worship. They do not believe in Christian festivals like christmas or easter. Sikhs do not believe in heaven, hell, evil spirits or Satan. Sikhs also do not believe in superstitions like miracles. They also do not believe in Adam and eve as first humans and story of their expulsion from heaven. They do share some beliefs with Christianity like service, remembering God, no caste-ism, having faith in Gurus and God etc.  To know more about Sikhism you may visit www.sikhnet.com|`|SMqEGqPSaa	No , Who told you that !!<br>  We dont believe in Jesus or any Christian figure ;<br>  We are followers of Guru Nanak , look up in wikipedia ;<br>  Sikhism is neither a Hindu- Muslim amalgam as many say ;<br>  & neither is it Hinduism, as many Hindus claim ;<br>  Sikhism is a path on its own ;<br>  Its NOT Hinduism, its NOT Islam also|`|c44646a18c8896be726212ea99b06820aa	Sikhism (Pronunciation:  /?si?k?z?m/ (help·info) or  /?s?k?z?m/ ; Punjabi: ?????, sikkhī, IPA:  [?s?k??i?] ), founded on the teachings of Guru Nanak and nine successive Sikh Gurus in fifteenth century Punjab, is the fifth-largest organized religion in the world.[1] This system of religious philosophy and expression has been traditionally known as the Gurmat (literally the counsel of the gurus) or the Sikh Dharma. Sikhism originated from the word Sikh, which in turn comes from the Sanskrit root ?i?ya meaning "disciple" or "learner", or ?ik?a meaning "instruction"[2][3].<br>  The principal belief of Sikhism is faith in Vāhigurū—represented using the sacred symbol of ēk ōa?kār, the Universal God. Sikhism advocates the pursuit of salvation through disciplined, personal meditation on the name and message of God. A key distinctive feature of Sikhism is a non-anthropomorphic concept of God, to the extent that one can interpret God as the Universe itself. The followers of Sikhism are ordained to follow the teachings of the ten Sikh gurus, or enlightened leaders, as well as the holy scripture entitled the Gurū Granth Sāhib, which, along with the writings of six of the ten Sikh Gurus, includes selected works of many devotees from diverse socio-economic and religious backgrounds. The text was decreed by Gobind Singh, the tenth guru, as the final guru of the Khalsa Panth. Sikhism's traditions and teachings are distinctively associated with the history, society and culture of the Punjab. Adherents of Sikhism are known as Sikhs (students or disciples) and number over 23 million across the world. Most Sikhs live in the Punjab in India and, prior to India's partition, millions of Sikhs lived in what is now Pakistani Punjab.[4]|`|YLW7cEjkaa	No, sikhism is a combination of hinduism and islam, mostly found in India.|`|RVsl8ZKfaa	No, I believe that it's a combination of Islam and Hinduism.|`|vl3jH9oHaa	not at all.|`|0hdo4WORaa	No

See Jer 6:2, II Cor 11:2, Eph 5:23-27, Hos 2:5 etc<br>  <br>  So we know the whore is a religious institution.<br>  <br>  Next, Revelation 17:9 says "Here is the mind which has wisdom: The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits."<br>  <br>  Almost any European can tell you that Rome, Italy is known historically as "The city of 7 hills" or "The city of 7 mountains".<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_hills_of_Rome" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_hills...</a><br>  <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Rome:-City-of-Seven-Hills&id=361128" rel="nofollow">http://ezinearticles.com/?Rome:-City-of-...</a><br>  <br>  So now we know that the "Whore of Babylon" is a religious institution that sits in Rome. <br>  <br>  Third, Revelations 17:4 says "The woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the filthiness of her fornication."<br>  <br>  Please see this pictures linked:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.adishakti.org/images/cardinals.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.adishakti.org/images/cardinal...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://s30.photobucket.com/albums/c305/benodette/june%202006/Spring%202007/august%2007/Quater1%202008/?action=view&current=April17MassNatStadiumGetty.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s30.photobucket.com/albums/c305/b...</a><br>  <br>  Rev 17:6 "I saw the woman, drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus."<br>  <br>  Tens of thousands were killed by the papacy during the dark ages, who refused to pay homage to the Catholic church.<br>  <br>  Revelation 17:3 "...And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast which was full of names of blasphemy...:<br>  <br>  The pope claims to have to power to forgive sins, and to make changes to the Word of God, which He has done over the years, even to the 10 commandments.<br>  <br>  Respectfully, the Bible calls this blasphemy.<br>  <br>  On a personal note, I have nothing against Catholics, and believe that there will be many in heaven.

7f19096dfc203109750db707ef0faeedaa	Le coming out, contraction de l'expression coming out of the closet (littéralement : ? sortir du placard ?) désigne principalement l'annonce volontaire d'une orientation sexuelle ou d'une identité de genre. Ce fait de ? rester dans le placard ? tend à diminuer au regard d'une acceptation grandissante de l'homosexualité comme une caractéristique privée. Le coming-out peut se faire dans un ou plusieurs milieux : la famille (proche/éloigné), les amis, le travail, les voisins, etc.<br>  <br>  être in désigne des personnes qui s'autodéfinissent gay, lesbiennes, bisexuels ou trans(genre/sexuel), mais qui ne l'annoncent pas par peur du rejet ou de la discrimination que cela peut engendrer. être out, à l'inverse, signifie ne pas dissimuler son orientation sexuelle ou son identité de genre. être outé, c'est voir ces caractéristiques rendues publiques sans son consentement, voire contre sa volonté.<br>  <br>  L'outing est un procédé, contesté, de déclaration publique de l'homosexualité d'une personne qui souhaite la garder secrète, souvent dans un but politique (par exemple, dénoncer une divergence entre style de vie privée et propos publics). Act Up a notamment menacé en 1999 d'? outer ? un député, homosexuel et présent à la manifestation anti-Pacs du 31 janvier 1999 où ont été entendus des slogans homophobes, mais ne l'a pas fait.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	Excellent question!

Too bad she's stuck with a crazy like Sarah Palin.|`|tI1NHwfBaa	Utter fail on so many levels.<br>  <br>  I assume by looking down on Bristol Palin, you're suggesting that you're morally better off than she is, is that right?<br>  <br>  Secondly, no one says that you have to be Christian to be moral.  If that were so, then the need for Christ would be obvious.  Instead, the fact that we all have an innate sense of morality that transcends culture and time is actually proof that a God exists and cares how we behave.<br>  <br>  Third, anyone can find an example of a sinful human, regardless of their values and beliefs.  That you would build an argument on one individual is so inane it's not worth even commenting on ... but you should be ashamed to be so obviously foolish.|`|xUXpfKyIaa	This made me laugh, thanks.

D1i4zdpgaa	Segregation is a broad term.<br>  <br>  I will go with the assumption that you are referencing segregation based on race, as was common practice before civil rights reform.<br>  <br>  Racial segregation is flawed, on the premise that an individual's worth can be defined by color of skin or heritage, instead of by the content of their character.<br>  <br>  It assumes that one's worth is predetermined by factors outside of their control (skin color, hair color, height, place of birth), instead of being created by their actions.<br>  <br>  People are not defined by how they look or where they were born. They are defined by what they do. Racial segregation is antithetical to this truth.|`|qK91Vd2Eaa	Because were into 2009 and plus what they do with all the mutt/mixed/bi racial kids lol|`|2xaVpnNNaa	because it keeps us close minded about other races....|`|6NEPcZFfaa	There pretty much is still, I went to a few schools with a 1% black student body in it.

A world without it would be scary and wrong, for me.|`|gBGuyVgUaa	Sex is the natural instinct of all living beings just like hunger or thirst. Hence, the truth is that sex needs no marriage and thus no priest or God. <br>  But, (unfortunately) for the humans, the marriage became a license issued by the society so that societal order is well maintained.  The institution of marriage is basically an artificial way of controlling anarchy in the society. While, sex is the way to continue the progeny, society wanted it to be controlled so that the children born do not become helpless and uncared for. <br>  Thus, in reality sex is never a crime - whether it is pre marital or post marital between two consenting adults. But, may be as a sacrifice, you must adhere to social norms to keep the society under meaningful order.|`|jBTBMzPpaa	I'm still a virgin. I'm not going to wait until marriage.

Apparently, sex outside of marriage and all that is some horrible, evil thing. It's worse than clubbing baby seals, even.|`|HqHM1jZCaa	Sex is sex disregarding of the forms it is connected. People have to be married by a priest in order to have sex is according to the beliefs of their religion or culture but moreover today people does sex before getting married or not. and yeah some knights of the altar told me that nuns and priest do have sex with each other. jeezz.. they feel hot too..ahahha|`|Q3aZkl9zaa	Any pre-marital sex is sinful.<br>  Gays who can't leaglly get married should get the best the can get like civik unions, domestic partnerships, etc. before having sex.|`|UV7zs9Wzaa	God did join Adam and Eve together,true.But priests have to do it for Him now,as the time when God could walk upon a sinless world is LONG gone.|`|sMoAqV7Jaa	I personally believe that the world would be a better place if people wouldn't have pre marital sex.

d2d6d1d2d206350f4858f15ffbfaafa3aa	It is probably just you.  After all, you have no way of knowing whether you are more depressed than other folks or not.  Only you know how you feel inside and you have no way of knowing how other people feel inside.<br>  <br>  I have heard that the most depressed people are the ones who hide it the best.<br>  <br>  But it sounds to me like you are having a hard time dealing with the desire to please your parents and the desire to please yourself.  I recommend that you pursue that which gives you the most satisfaction and maintains your interest.   <br>  <br>  If you were truly emotionally or physically abused as a child (and most of us have been to one extent or another), you need to accept this and also understand this is in your past and doesn't have to control your present or your future.   If you can't break out of this rut of feeling you have to sacrifice your happiness to please others, you should get some good counseling to help you work thru this.  YA is not going to do the trick for you, no matter how good the advice may be.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|kL8BzsBNaa	Indian (with parents who have traditional moral) + gay= almost guaranteed depression<br>  <br>  Have you ever thought of being around more gay people.

I love my life!|`|oYiAX12Xaa	We all go through rough times and we all have our different types of problems. Obviously, it may be hard for you to connect with your straight friends because you're gay and they're not. Hopefully, they care about you enough to be comfortable with your sexuality. Honestly, I think you should talk to maybe a counselor so you can get "real advice" from a professional. Don't be miserable forever because everyone deserves to be happy.|`|SIFyxFFpaa	ditto for me to what bill c said.<br>  <br>  being gay can make you feel as if you do not fit in.<br>  <br>  plus, you had a rough childhood.....<br>  <br>  you may benefit from gay group therapy.<br>  <br>  i don't know your city, but i am in los angeles and there are all sorts of help groups.<br>  <br>  just an idea.|`|OoNivmTlaa	I think its normal to feel disconnected from your straight friends.

I have a couple of other gay and bi friends, and some seem happy and some are depressed. <br>  Im in the same predicament as you, and it's just peer pressure. Everyone goes through it. I don't have good connection with my parents. Just know that they love you and it's just pressure they are putting on you. Don't let anything stop you from doing what you REALLY want.|`|gcNEb1Tpaa	i understand.... but maybe thats just in your head.<br>  Honestly your probably not any more sad|`|273vsUezaa	I'm trying to make this not sound as mean, so bear with me on this...<br>  <br>  <br>  Stop feeling so sorry for yourself. If you're proud of who you are then don't worry so much about your parents or the kids you went to school with. After you were called a fag, Some other kids were called fatass or had their buck teeth pointed out... Just think of school as a sort of Boot camp where you can't control the people you hang with<br>  <br>  <br>  Be yourself, by yourself and with others. <br>  <br>  <br>  Then change your avatar cuz you totally have a chick avatar lol|`|KhnfO5kAaa	self esteem issues are always hard to get over. yahoo answers wont help much but i can give you advice. first of all, you SHOULD NOT be working at where ever it is if you dont like it. life is too short to be wasting time. Do something that you want to do, something your good at, whatever it may be as long as your happy. You also need to think positive. After awhile you get used to it and it becomes natural. If something bothers you, dont let it get to you, you cant take things too seriously. I was the same way a few years back but then i just stopped thinking about the negative. Its easier said than done but its true. And you should never be afraid to show who you really are. I know what you mean, i was the same way. but after a while i got so tired of trying to hide myself. You also cant go through life worrying about what other people think about you. What are they gonna do about it? Kill you? i dont think so. Anyways, i havent really answered your question yet, so the answer is, its more common for gay people to be more depressed. Only because since being gay is still "controversial" that they find it hard to be themselves and are always thinking about what other people will think about them. But you should always be yourself, otherwise, whats the point?

UinOWcMUaa	The power of the evil eye is sometimes held to be involuntary; a Slavic folktale, for example, relates the story of a father afflicted with the evil eye who blinded himself in order to avoid injuring his own children. More frequently, however, malice toward and envy of prosperity and beauty are thought to be the cause. Thus, in medieval Europe--and in popular superstition today--it was considered unlucky to be praised or to have one's possessions praised, so that some qualifying phrase such as "as God will" or "God bless it" was commonly used. <br>  <br>  Measures taken to ward off the evil eye may vary among cultures. For example, some authorities suggest that the purpose of ritual cross-dressing--a practice that has been noted in the marriage ceremonies of parts of India--is to avert the evil eye. Asian children sometimes have their faces blackened, especially near the eyes, for protection. Among some Asian and African peoples the evil eye is particularly dreaded while eating and drinking, because the soul is thought to be more vulnerable when the mouth is open; thus; the ingestion of substances is either a solitary activity or takes place only with the immediate family and behind locked doors. Other means of protection, common to many traditions, include the wearing of sacred texts, amulets, charms, and talismans (which may also be hung upon animals for their protection); certain gestures; and the display of ritual drawings or objects. <br>  <br>  The existence of a demonic kingdom was accepted by the rabbis without question. Evil spirits are invisible and fill the nether world. They avoid sunlight and concentrate in waters and deserted places. They also mingle with people, trouble them, and help them. They have passions and are born and die like people. However, they also have some of the traits and powers of angels. The evil eye was considered as dangerous as evil spirits. It was thought that for mysterious reasons some people have the power to injure others by looking at them and that it is generally jealousy that triggers this effect. The rabbis, however, repeatedly emphasized that all of these strange powers are under the divine government and, moreover, that they cannot hurt the pious.|`|SGNfTcGHaa	Im American and neither do I.

Having realistically recognized others' kindness as well as their faults, love is always focused on the other person’s welfare. We have no ulterior motives to fulfill our self-interest, or to fulfill our desires: we love others simply because they exist. Attachments, on the other hand, exaggerates others' good qualities and makes us crave to be with them. When we're with them, we're happy, but when we're separated from them, we are often miserable. These selfish attachments are linked with expectations of what others should be or do. Is love as it is usually understood in most societies really love? or selfish attachments ? Let us examine this a bit more. Generally we are attracted to people either because they have qualities we value or because they help us in some way. If we observe our own thought processes mindfully, and carefully - we'll notice that we look for specific qualities in others. Some of these qualities we find attractive, others are those our parents, or society value. We examine someone's looks, education, financial situation, social status. This is how most of us decide on whether or not the person holds any true value to us. In addition, we judge people as worthwhile according to how they relate to us! If they help us, praise us, make us feel secure, listen to what we have to say, care for us when we are sick or depressed, we consider them good people, and it is this type of people we are most likely to be more attracted to. But this is very biased, for we judge them only in terms of how they relate to "us", as if we are the most important person in the world. After we've judged certain people to be good for us, whenever we see them it appears to us as if goodness is coming from them, but if we are more aware, we recognize that we have projected this goodness onto them. Desiring to be with the people a lot who make us feel good, we become emotional yo-yo's - when we're with these people, we're up, when we're not with these people, we're down. Furthermore, we form fixed concepts of what our relationships with those people will be and thus have expectations of them. When they do not live up to our expectations of them, we're very disappointed, or may become angry. We want them to change so that they will they will match what we think they are. But our projections and expectations come from our own minds, not from the other people. Our problems arise not because others aren't who we thought they we're, but because we mistakenly thought they were something they aren't. Checklist: "I Love You if __________ " What we call love is most often selfish attachments. It is actually a disturbing attitude that overestimates the qualities of another person. We then cling to tightly to that person, thinking our happiness depends on that person. Love, on the other hand, is an open and very calm, relaxed attitude. We want someone to be happy, and free from suffering simply because they exist. Attachments obscures our judgment and we become impatient, angry, and impartial, helping only our dear ones and harming those who we don't like. Love clarifies our minds and we access a situation by thinking of the greatest good for everyone. Attachments are based on selfishness, while Love is founded upon cherishing others, even those who do not look very appealing to the eyes. Love looks beyond all the superficial appearances, and dwells on the fact that they are just like us: they want inner peace, happiness, and want to avoid suffering. If we see dirty, unattractive, ignorant people, we feel repulsed because our selfish minds want to know attractive, intellectual, clean, and talented people. Love never evaluates others by these superficial standards and looks much deeper into the person. Love recognizes that regardless of the others' appearances, their experience is the same as ours: they seek inner peace, to be happy, to be free from sufferings, and to do their best to avoid problems. When we're attached, we're not mentally and emotionally free. We overly depend on and cling to another person to fulfill our mental and especially our emotional needs. We fear losing the person, feeling we'd be incomplete without him. However, this does not mean that we should suppress our emotional needs or become aloof, alone and totally independent, for that too does not solve the problem. We must simply realize our unrealistic needs, and slowly seek to eliminate them. Some emotional needs may be so strong that they can't be dissolved immediately. If we try to suppress them or pretend they do not exist, we become anxious, insecure, falling into a depression. In this case, we can do our best to fulfill our needs while simultaneously working gradually to subdue them. The core problem is that most of us seek to be loved, rather than to love. We yearn to be understood by others rather than to understand them. In all honesty, our sense of emotional insecurities comes from the selfishness obscuring our own minds. 'We can develop self-confidence by recognizing our inner potential to become a selfless human being with many, magnificent qualities, then we'll develop a true and accurate feeling of self-confidence. Then we'll seek to increase true love, without attachments, to increase compassion, to cultivate loving-kindness, patience and understanding, compassion, generosity, concentration and wisdom. Under the influence of attachments we're bound by our emotional reactions to others. When they are nice to us, we're happy. When they ignore us, or speak sharply to us, we take it personally and are unhappy. But pacifying these attachment doesn't mean we become hard-hearted. Rather, without attachment there will be space in our hearts and minds for genuine affection and impartial love for them. We'll be actively involved with them. As we learn to subdue our selfish attachments, we can have successful friendships and personal relationships with others. These relationships will be richer because of the freedom and respect which the relationships will be based on. We'll care about the happiness and the misery of all human beings equally, simply because everyone is the same-wanting happiness and peace of mind. However, our lifestyles and interests may be more compatible with those of some people more so than with others and that is alright. In any case, our relationships will be based on mutual love, mutual interests, and the wish to help each other in life".|`|2TavF36Daa	Wisdom.<br>  <br>  If one is wise, they know the value of Love.<br>  <br>  If one is wise, they will seek education.<br>  <br>  If one is wise, intelligence is respected.|`|tLARGcr9aa	Love, wisdom, intelligence, education in that order for both.|`|oGRsxfBiaa	Love, always.. because I could be educated, intelligent and wise, but without love I would still be lonely and miserable.|`|BPO6roTOaa	Intelligence|`|uK3tkaOJaa	Love, in both cases.

You shot yourself in the foot because you let your emotions and desires have reign over your intellect and will.  Start promoting the gospel and help other young people out of the same situation that you fell into.  So basically, the Lord isn't hurting you, you are hurting him by disregarding his loving logical limits that he sets for romantic relationships.  You should repent and make it your aim from now on to be useful for the gospel instead of trying to get God to be useful to you.  God has rights as our creator to require us to be wholly His, without conditions on our part.  You are not His unless you are His, UNCONDITIONALLY.  You are in for a rocky ride emotionally, but I would pray all the more if I were you but for the right reasons and for the right objects.  If God ever wants you to get married, he'll help you find a suitable wife, but only when you climb off the emotional rollercoaster and start using your head in his service.  I'll pray for strength for you if it helps, but keep what I said in mind.  Many young people's lives have gone off the track permanently because they allowed their feelings to get involved in relationships that God didn't intend.  Don't end up a backslider who hates God for not taking away your free choice.  You must own the hurt you feel as something you have done to yourself.

Most pedophiles are known to have been abused as kids in a sexual manner. One thing has nothing to do with the other. Pedophiles CHOOSE to be that way, they know theyr feelings are illigal and wrong and they can CHOOSE to get treated by a psychiatrist. Now homosexuals, there's no known cure. <br>  <br>  (:<br>  Take care|`|fdMKpXCHaa	Most of those things you mention are very different from one another and can't be all lumped together.  They certainly can't all be blamed on biology either.  If it's all biology then you can't really hold people responsible for anything.  It's in someones biology to molest someone?  Then they certainly couldn't help it.    Why should they be punished then?  If it's genetic, why aren't there whole families of molesters, etc?  To answer your initial question, "What are people thinking"?  It seems clear that not a lot of people are thinking.|`|EmV1Kojyaa	I am not of the same opinion that you are. I believe that people who are gay or become drug addicts or become a pedophile, are definitely NOT born that way. A lot of gay people insist that their condition is genetic, but I do not believe it. If human beings have DNA that cause them to be homosexual, eventually there would be no procreation. God created us to be heterosexual. Therefore, I think the homosexual condition is "self-influenced". Drug addicts experiment with drugs that are hard usually because they are chasing away pain and emotions which cannot be removed with just a "talk". People who live these lifestyles, more often than not, engage in activities that are opposed to society to prove themselves, to others as well. The person who becomes a pedophile has their thinking altered in whatever way (severe emotional abuse or physical abuse) to project their anger toward someone helpless and innocent. It gives them superiority. Their crimes are usually not sexual in origin, they are serious, unresolved control issues. Pedophiles are actually intense cowards who have no discipline over their own lives. Some pedophiles have mental illness, but is not always the case.<br>  <br>  My own husband is a recovering cocaine addict. He told me he started this drug because "nothing else chased the pain away". He was severely physically abused as a young boy. He's been to counselling, psychologists, psychiatrists, pastors, and nobody can help him. I do not begrudge him this part of his life, nor do I judge him in any way. You don't understand that kind of pain, neither do I. However, I watch my husband struggle every day to stay away from that damn drug. He uses his faith in God to keep him strong.<br>  <br>  There is nothing to be 'fired up' about. What do you consider a NORMAL human being? Just because it doesn't fall within your own parameters, doesn't mean you have a right to judge. I've never drank or done any drugs in my life. I did smoke briefly, but it doesn't mean I have an addictive personality. I have a mental illness. I'm apparently "missing connections in my brain" which makes me very sad and emotional. So are you going to judge me too?

He revealed God to His disciples in a way that wrought in their hearts a special work, such as He has long been urging us to allow Him to do in our hearts. There are many who in dwelling so largely on theory have lost sight of the living power of the Saviour's example. They have lost sight of Him and as the self-denying, humble worker. What they need is to behold Jesus. Daily they need the fresh revealing of His presence. They need to follow more closely His example of self-renunciation and sacrifice.<br>  <br>       We need the experience that Paul had when he wrote, "I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me."

Their reform movement helped make Unitarians what we are today. Here is the lead from the Wikipedia article:<br>  <br>  Transcendentalism began as a protest against the general state of culture and society, and in particular, the state of intellectualism at Harvard and the doctrine of the Unitarian church taught at Harvard Divinity School. Among transcendentalists' core beliefs was an ideal spiritual state that 'transcends' the physical and empirical and is only realized through the individual's intuition, rather than through the doctrines of established religions. Prominent transcendentalists included Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Orestes Brownson, William Henry Channing, James Freeman Clarke, Christopher Pearse Cranch, Convers Francis, Margaret Fuller, Frederick Henry Hedge, Sylvester Judd, Elizabeth Peabody, George Ripley, Amos Bronson Alcott, and Jones Very.<br>  ====================|`|cdFqekzZaa	Each individual church is different.

If you wake up every morning and brush your teeth, is that not a ritual?  As a Catholic, you might be better suited for kaballah.  Rituals in the beginning are tools to be used.  As you progress down your path you will find 'ritual shortcuts' that can be used instead of long drawn out rituals.  For certain things, you will always need rituals, but for others there are shortcuts.  As far as what rituals to do, you should find ones that just 'feel right' to you.

The Bible, in fact, does not teach the Trinity.  That's a doctrine that has it roots in ancient Babylonian religion, where they worshiped triads of gods.  There are a great deal of pagan customs that were introduced into the church many many years ago as a way to make Christianity more palatable to people of other religions.|`|TyRfv0eoaa	The doctrine of the Trinity states that one God eternally exists in three persons. If that is the case, why is there no verse of scripture that refers to God as "persons"? (Although there is scripture in Job that refers to His person... singular.)<br>  <br>  And why is the only verse that uses the number three in relation to God a fraud? (I John 5:7 as it appears in KJV. This verse is not present in ANY Greek manuscript earlier than 11th century, and even then, it was only scrawled in the margin. It first appears in late manuscripts of the Vulgate. Many modern translations leave it out, because it is without scriptural authority.)<br>  <br>  Scriptures says over and over that God is one. It never says God is three... three persons or three anything else.<br>  <br>  Father, Son and Holy Spirit are not persons in the Godhead, but just the ways the one God has revealed Himself to man. His essence is Spirit (John 4:24). He is our Father in Creation. He took on flesh as the son for our redemption.<br>  <br>  Edit: If Matthew 28:19 teaches trinity, why did the apostles never repeat those titles in baptism? Read the book of Acts. They baptized everyone in the name of Jesus. Why? Because Jesus is the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.|`|luwBPdE8aa	What the Quran says has nothing to do with this.  The main thing is that no Old Testament writer and no apostle ever said "God in three persons," not one single time.  I find this strange if that is what God wants us to believe.  The Bible does emphasize that God is one.  Read Deuteronomy 4:35-39 and Isaiah chapters 43 to 46.  It says God stretched forth the heavens ALONE.  Jesus explained in John 14 how that he is in the Father, and the Father in him.  Also if the Holy Spirit is a separate person, why does he not have a name, and why do we never read about the Father speaking to the Holy Spirit, or the Holy Spirit speaking to the Father?  It does say the Father will send the Holy Spirit; if they are separate persons, equally God, then one could not send the other; it would have just said the Holy Spirit would come; but God is sending his own substance.  The Father is who God is; Holy Spirit is what God is.  There is no "third person."  Also in Revelation 1 Jesus is the first and the last.|`|EBGdlo35aa	1) Does the Bible teach the Trinity?<br>  <br>  No - but there are several biblical passages supporting this doctrine.<br>  <br>  <br>  2) Since the trinity doctrine cannot be explained<br>  <br>  This is simply an untrue statement.<br>  <br>  <br>  3) according to many we cannot really know or understand God<br>  <br>  You interpret this claim much too broadly.  It does not mean (clearly) that "we cannot know or understand *anything* about God".  It merely means that "we cannot know or understand God *completely*".  You can know and understand automobiles without *really* knowing how one works or how one is constructed.  We *can* know and understand God in a limited fashion - in the ways that he has revealed himself to us.  However, we can never really *fully* know or understand God.<br>  <br>  <br>  4) how could Jesus tell the Samaritan woman at the well: “We worship what we know,” (John 4:22)<br>  <br>  Because the Jews knew more about God than the Samaritans, who accept only the Samaritan Pentateuch as Scripture.  The Jews have a much more complete understanding of God than do the Samaritans.<br>  <br>  <br>  5) no one fully knows the Son but the Father, neither does anyone fully know the Father but the Son and anyone to whom the Son is willing to reveal him<br>  <br>  THERE you go.  Notice the word "fully".  *That* is the important point.  Clearly, the doctrine of trinity does not explain the nature of God in its entirely - that is, every detail, every nuance of the nature of God.  It is, quite the contrary, a very broad sort of "overview" description of the nature of God.<br>  <br>  <br>  6) why is the Holy Spirit no included in this statement?<br>  <br>  Because the Holy Spirit is not identified as a "person" until later in John<br>  <a href="http://www.studybibleforum.com/htm_php.php3?do=jump_to_chapter&refstr=John+14%3A26&trans=NASB" rel="nofollow">http://www.studybibleforum.com/htm_php.p...</a><br>  <br>  Jim, <a href="http://www.bible-reviews.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible-reviews.com</a>|`|WdAuncq9aa	O followers of the Book! do not exceed the limits in your religion, and do not speak (lies) against Allah, but (speak) the truth; the Messiah, Isa son of Marium is only a messenger of Allah and His Word which He communicated to Marium and a spirit from Him; believe therefore in Allah and His messengers, and say not, Three.

It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. 5It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. 6Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. 7It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres. <br>  <br>   8Love never fails. But where there are prophecies, they will cease; where there are tongues, they will be stilled; where there is knowledge, it will pass away. 9For we know in part and we prophesy in part, 10but when perfection comes, the imperfect disappears. 11When I was a child, I talked like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I put childish ways behind me. 12Now we see but a poor reflection as in a mirror; then we shall see face to face.

While your at it, analyze whether or not you would be able to have sex with that person.<br>  <br>  Only then will you be able to figure out what is happening.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|aWPmvPpfaa	you re a young dude, its impossible to control your penius, it controls you.|`|2lim0SHvaa	Allow me to wear you out.|`|n0LgFJ6laa	It happens because you are a big boy now.

White history is taught throughout the school year and Black history is only taught in one small month. Majority of teachers are White and know next to nothing about Black history.<br>  <br>  Nearly all of my students are Black. We celebrate the month by going somewhere BIG. This year was to see one of the world's greatest Stepping teams. Instead of focusing on just February, we learn Black history throughout the entire school year. Making, not to brag, a long list of Black parents trying to get their kids into my class because there are only 2 Black teachers in this school.<br>  <br>  As for White history, of course we study it too in my class when possible because of the extreme demand for standardized testing in literacy and math. I tend to focus more on eastern and southern European history as schools focus only on western European history.<br>  <br>  Next, I wish I knew more Asian American history. I am learning.<br>  <br>  PS. Sorry to say, my students (elementary) are the only students learning more than just Rosa Parks and MLK.

fgxajTiBaa	If you recognize that you have pushed down feelings for girls in the past then you haven't only wanted just this girl.<br>  <br>  You might not be a lesbian, but you're probably at least bisexual/pansexual. I liked a lot of girls growing up but I ignored it until I met one girl when I was about 14 and I acknowledged that I had a crush on her. I felt like crap about it and pushed it way down. Two years later, I finally admitted to myself I was gay and I am so much more confident and happy. Loving and understanding who you are is a wonderful thing.<br>  <br>  Whether you're gay, straight, bi or whatev, I hope you figure it out :)|`|7IogJOgBaa	Your probably bi, unless you have no feelings at all for guys.

The very thought of it seemed so unreal and impossible. You see I knew I had a crush on the girl but I would tell myself after that one I would never feel that way towards a woman again. After that one came another and another, and now that I'm comfy with my feelings I've realized I knew since the first "girl crush" I was just in denial with myself. I hope my little story helps some. If you've had crushes on other girls chances are you are in fact bi/gay, but don't sweat it, you'll learn to accept what you feel. (Whether its towards a male or female. After all why should love be limited to gender when there are beautiful, intelligent and sweet women at the turn of every page? )|`|0lnamekJaa	I realized that I was "Different" from the other girls in my class when I just couldn't understand what they meant when the would talk about how "Cute" a guy was... How "Hot" a celeb was...<br>  <br>  When I looked at a male, I felt NOTHING... While they would blush and have all sorts of physical and verbal reactions.<br>  <br>  Yet when I saw chicks in swimsuits... I felt "Tingly". When I saw hot chicks on TV I felt a twitch in my stomach...<br>  <br>  I realized by the age of 10 that I was in to girls... <br>  <br>  It was through watching how other females reacted to guys that I realized that I didn't act anything like they did.
CWWoISqkaa	a. Aphrodite send Eros/Cupid to stuck Psyche with an arrow to make her fall in love with an ugly man for her husband. For she was very beautiful and was a threat to Aphrodite (people started to like Psyche more)<br>  b. He didn't complete it cause he fell in love with her himself. One version he pricks himself with his arrow, in other versions he just falls in love with her b/c of her beauty.<br>  c. Ummm, his mother wasn't happy with this, so I guess Eros/Cupid was afraid of his mother's wrath. <br>  d. The problem was that Psyche could never really see Eros/Cupid face to face, she could only talk to him at night too.<br>  e. Her sisters were jealous that Psyche had a magnificent house (& sort of, husband) Eros/Cupid was supposed to be a "dragon" so they were able to persuade Psyche to sneek (at night) and see if he was really a dragon (had a lamp + knife)<br>  f. umm, Eros/Cupid woke up and ran away, Psyche wandered the Earth until she finally came to Aphrodite's house. She made Psyche do these difficult tasks, but she got help from people/animals. Once she had to bring back an ounce of Persephone's beauty in a box; but she was curious & opened it (kinda killed her) Eros/Cupid found her, live happily ever after (=<br>  <br>  NEXT TIME DO YOUR OWN HOMEWORK !|`|mTvsuaxYaa	Oh, I LOVE this myth. Let's go...<br>  <br>  a. Aphrodite was jealous of Psyche because everyone said that Psyche was more beautiful than her. So she sent her son to make Psyche fall in love with a terrible monster in revenge.<br>  b. Well, he nicked himself with one of his golden arrows and fell madly in love with Psyche.<br>  c. I don't believe I understand your wording on this one. Sorry.<br>  d. Well, he can't tell her he's the god of love, nor can he tell his mother that he failed in his task. So he pretends to be a monster instead.<br>  e. They think that she is a fool, and say that she has a monster who will kill her.<br>  f. Do you mean at this point in the story? Because the ending is happy. She gets to stay with Eros.

wM7pprr1aa	The fundamental difference is that bodies interred in cardboard coffins ARE NOT EMBALMED, they decompose naturally, like creatures in the wild do.  It is embalmed corpses that endanger the environment.  <br>  <br>  We've only been embalming corpses for the last hundred years or so, and for pretty much that entire time, they've been buried in steel or aluminum caskets further encased in concrete boxes, like the sarcophogi of the ancient egyptians.  The fluids from those corpses aren't expected to make their way into the water tables for another 150 to 200 years.<br>  <br>  By ending embalming practices and allowing more natural decomposition, we're limiting the environmental harm out remains will cause future generations.  Sadly, far too many individuals would rather send toxins down through time to their descendants.|`|eO2rnf7yaa	The truth is that many inexpensive steel caskets rust through in only a few years in wet soils.    I am Roman Catholic.  The Catholic Church used to prohibit cremation.  It is now permitted, so long as the cremation is not engaged in with a denial that resurrection will include the body.   For believers,  this is simple - resurrection is miraculous no matter what,  so God can raise us bodily from the dead even after cremation.  I think cremation makes a lot of sense,  but I don't know if I would choose it for another person - or even for myself.   Most cemeteries will permit two cremation urns to be buried in one cemetery plot.  For some couples who have very little money,  this can be a very sensible and practical choice.<br>  <br>  Peace be with you.|`|Z5TuccoIaa	another incredibly stupid decision by the FDA|`|AA10945101	Haven't heard about this but I doubt the FDA could overrule local or state ordinances related to burial.  For example, where I live (on the gulf of Mexico), people are required to encase the regular casket in a metal box (unless buried above ground in a vault)...wouldn't matter if they used cardboard for the regular casket in this case.  In New Mexico (southern part at least), the casket must be placed in a sealed plastic container...again, cardboard would be fine.    <br>  <br>  The way I see it, it's pretty ridiculous to spend six grand for a fancy casket if you're going to seal it inside another box (that costs another three to five grand or more depending on required specifications). With so many localities requiring such practices, the cardboard "coffin liner" would save a lot of people a lot of money!   <br>  <br>  ...and when you really think about it, there are already so many hamsters, goldfish, ferrets, kittens and puppies buried in shoe boxes in backyards all over this country that if the water table is being contaminated by flesh decaying in cardboard, we're already doomed anyway!|`|Nf0FLjGhaa	"Won't the water tables become contaminated in Southern states?"<br>  <br>  if rotting wood doesn't contaminate the water table, how wood mostly-broken-down wood fibers contaminate it after rotting? and a slight aside: why waste money and space with caskets and graves any way? cremation is simpler, and it frees up more land for a better use|`|NrzxtivLaa	so, by that implication, the millions of animals that die on the roads, in the forests, and pets that are buried are more sanitary than a human corpse?.......where's the logic?

5515fbe4bde3824ce5a0d6e4b8fde157aa	Tlachtli<br>  <br>  "Tlachtli is an ancient form of a ballgame played by various cultures although it is generally associated with the Aztecs. The exact pronounciation is as it's spelled but because of the basic translation of native languages to Spanish during the Inquisition it's not how it originally was pronounced.<br>  <br>  Anyways, tlachtli was overall a brutal sport, rugby and American football have little on this sport. The game was played with a hard rubber ball (came right off of rubber tress) which became as hard as rock when temperatures dropped. Weighing anywhere from 5 to 10 pounds 2-5 players per team had to hit the ball with their elbows, hips or legs through a stone ring that was placed above the court typically several feet high.<br>  <br>  The walls of the court it was played in were slanted So that the ball could make a feable attempt at bouncing off and helped the odds of getting the ball into the stone ring. The court was set up like modern volleyball, one team on one side and the other team on the other side. In some cases the game would go on for days with no break until one team got the ball through the ring to score a point.<br>  <br>  The cultural importance of the game was huge to the Ancient Central American people because they would use the game for both weather predictions and as a form of human sacrifice. Priests and fortune tellers would study the path of the ball and they would create primitive forms of almanacs out of their predictions. Also at the end of the game either the winning team (the team that got the ball through the hoops the most) or the losing team would be offered to the ancient gods as sacrifice (the team to be sacrificed likely depended on the tribe such as Aztecs, Incas, ect).<br>  <br>  Some modern artifacts remain from the ball courts. In fact a near completely-intact court remains today at Chichen Itza."

yWUQUjx9aa	We aren't allowed to tell you.<br>  <br>  I think you are missing an important part of what he is saying.  The Illuminati, in bringing into existance the New World Order, are going to utilize the profecies of the book of revelations.  In doing so, "true believers" will except what is happening as fullfillment of Bible promises from the book of revelation and wait faithfully (and quietly) for the 2nd coming of Christ to save them.  But, Christ isn't going to come to save us and we will be stuck with the new world order.  So again,  this new world order, made by the illuminati, will appear to be fullfilling Bible profecy.  But, in actuality it is only using Bible profecy to control "believers".<br>  Please understand the distinction I am pointing out to you, it was what Cooper was trying to tell you.|`|c1Dpi0eyaa	Myth is no substitute for truth and reality.

I know much of it had to deal with the fact he said they did not need to buy penances. The catholic church at that time had many money hungry people and Luther helped exposed that. Not all catholics though were money hungry.<br>  <br>  2. They thought he was wicked also because he wanted to write the bible in another language other than latin which they (catholic) felt was the holy language and the one true language and so on.<br>  <br>  3. Luther wanted to bury people in the church graveyards that the catholics did not want such as suicides.<br>  <br>  As far as what he biblically taught I dont think was the main issue. It was mostly the fact that he was exposing some of the wickedness some of the catholics were doing shaming themselfs and other righteous catholics.<br>  It was sort of like a "christian" politics game.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped.

Marin Luther denied this, and taught that all people can reach god by praying, and their prayers didn't have to go through another person first.  To those who followed Luther, the Pope was of little importance.

Especially when I suddenly got promoted and had to be "the boss" to all my buddies. It's hard.<br>  <br>  -Something you can always say when someone tries to gossip about someone who's not there:<br>  <br>  "Well, Moira, I don't think we should talk about Bob since he's not here to defend himself."<br>  <br>  Say it politely, and smile, but make it clear you won't be a part of it.  If it continues, you can look at your watch, and ask if there will be anything else work related, because you have a meeting to go to, etc. <br>  <br>  If nothing else works, simply say, "Well, I have to be going now", and walk away.  They'll eventually get the hint.  But you can't ever give in.<br>  <br>  -Another thing is to dress as conservatively and professionally as is appropriate, and that you can afford.  If you let yourself look sloppy in appearance, it will make you look sloppy in your manners.   Dressing the part will also help you to sit up straighter, be proud of yourself, and remember your resolution. <br>  <br>  -If it's possible, and if it appeals to you, go for a promotion.  Most co-workers will realize that if you are above them, you need to act more appropriately.  You can be a good example for them, and your supervisors, even now, by just refusing to join in, or even laugh at their sophomoric jokes.<br>  <br>  -Do a little reinventory.  Surely there is one person in your company who feels the same as you, or at least leans in that direction.  Pull them aside, go to lunch with them, and tell them how you're feeling.  Make a friend (a professional one) who you can count on for support and who you can just know thinks similarly.  Spend your time with these quality people.   There may be someone who is now looking for the same thing, and thinks they're alone.<br>  <br>  -If you can't find anyone in your department or shift that holds these same values, consider changing to a different one where you can effectively "start over" without making too big a difference in your position. <br>  <br>  Anywhere from small towns, school, or an office, it is hard to re-invent yourself, but it can be done with a little perseverance.

Just to add to that.  So that it's not such a shock to your co-workers, start this 're-establishment' of yourself on a Monday (or which ever day is the 1st of your work week).  That way it seems more of a fresh start to you and your colleagues.<br>  <br>  If someone asks just say "I'm not into knowing about such and such anymore." If your supervisor starts gossiping just state "Sorry to interrupt so-and-so, but I'm not quite comfortable hearing about this.  I respect you but could we please change the topic?"<br>  <br>  My dept has 3 people: myself, my boss (she's female) and my colleague (also female).  Sometimes my boss and my colleague tend to be a bit gossipy (hey! they're female! I'm not judging - it's in the DNA! :D).  When I notice that starting to happen, I just excuse myself from the discussion by going back to my office or go make some tea or whatever.  It's passive but my co-workers notice it and I think I look better for it in the long run.

At 20 you shouldn't be worrying about what your mother thinks so much. I understand you have to while under her roof; this is exactly why you should get out.|`|AA12005401	I have never told my mother I am gay... She knows.  She is around my lover... My lover and I live together so she is not confused about the relationship at all.  I just bring him around her.  I let her like him as a person and then she put 2 and 2 together.|`|nT0w6VIKaa	Hmmm...well, first of all, 'the sleepover'...you might remember that your "parents house" is still THEIRS (NOT yours)...it's 'their house' and 'their rules'...like it or not.  It's called 'A MATTER OF RESPECT'...not 'I can do anything I want anywhere I want'...  PLEASE reconsider waiting till another time 'after your parents have known (for sure) for awhile'.  Now, 'how to tell your parents you're gay'...how about just taking your boyfriend over to their house and visiting.  'IF' the two of you are so 'in love', "THE GLOW" will be apparent (this does NOT require, in any fashion, that you and your boyfriend be 'overtly' romantic in front of them).  When your parents see how much you care for each other they should see that 'somethings up'.  If you don't sense that they're 'catching on' (toward the end of your visit), you might drop a few hints...like (his name) and I are planing on being together after I graduate from college...or...(his name) and I are moving in together...or...(his name) and I are 'VERY' close and we're anxious to see what the future brings for us...  If you believe that they're STILL NOT catching on, you might just ask them what they think about your boyfriend and then respond accordingly...  Hopefully they will recognize 'two people in love' when they see you and your boyfriend...that will solve a lot of things...|`|585b7dfd77e867b2877fe507e55eb149aa	Just tell her that you have something important that you want to talk to her about. She probably doesn't know how to bring it up and is waiting for you to. Good luck.|`|395eb76612288ff21809ed601ce98c9baa	Don't. She knows already. You're 20 yo "asking for permission..." Trust me she knows...|`|78f66e9ff53857831996143ff8d5c2e6aa	i think you should tell her! she has every reason to be proud of you!! It is who you are, be open about it =]|`|VJRJh40Naa	If she has some kind of an idea then I don't think she will mind. It might be nice if you bring the guy with you when you tell your mum. You are an adult, so you don't really have to ask permission of any one. If it concerns her tell her the truth, or just say a friends party or something.|`|DUjr9tNUaa	Share a passionate kiss with him in front of her.|`|mKBveDhHaa	im proud of u|`|B8UYpXi2aa	Dude ur old enough to do wat u want ...but good luck !|`|wwwiWaK8aa	chances are if she does know she is pretty hurt that you told your sisters and not her. But she can also look at it as you telling those you are comfortable with and closer too.<br>  <br>  my best advice would be to take her somewhere special, maybe somewhere special to both of you? a place from your childhood? Go just the two of you and talk to her. Tell her what you are feeling and why you waited to tell her. Then gauge her response, I am sure you will find out quickly enough how she feels. <br>  <br>  As for the sleep over, well you are an adult, and the most you can do is ask. Just say mom I want to stay over at a friend's house on Saturday would that be ok ( not sure if you are planning to tell her about your BF before)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and good luck.
Aa6XHuENaa	Fear breeds religion<br>  <br>  And you'll have to forgive me for not believing the story.<br>  <br>  Either it's not true or that person was being an atheist because he thought it was cool.  An atheist who is firm in his/her views wouldn't pray to a deity that they do not believe exists|`|YZv8Ub3Haa	If that's accurate (which it may not be) it sounds like your friend's friend is a bit agnostic. He was probably raised in a theist home, and it's very difficult to completely break free of the conditioning performed since childhood. <br>  <br>  I promise you that I will never pray to either your god or any of the thousands of others described throughout history.|`|WX1b747Iaa	A forgivable lapse, equivalent to dropping a steamer in your trunks in the same situation, even though you're potty trained.|`|WRyHOEjSaa	I have no way of knowing the underlying motivations of your friend's friend, whom I've never met. Frankly neither do you, so you aren't in a good position to claim he subconsciously knows God exists and is just denying it. Other obvious possibilities are that he was raised religiously and so reverts to religious phrases when he's scared out of his thinking mind, much as adults who are dying are said to call for their mothers. Another possibility is that your friend mis-heard him, or that he's lying (despite your trust that he isn't).<br>  <br>  And no, that's not how all atheists would act.<br>  <br>  So why do theists put lightning rods on churches? Do they subconsciously know God doesn't exist, and are just denying it?|`|d529cebfe13576f3ddee3e55b4cd08ffaa	Given this society, most of us have grown up constantly hearing things like "oh my god," etc. So I'm not exactly surprised if a person says stuff when they grew up hearing it as something that is said when something bad is happening.<br>  <br>  Cripe, quite frequently I say "oh good god" in frustration at work...at large retail store where customers have no manners at all and leave us to clean up after adults destroy the place.<br>  <br>  Doesn't mean I mean it in any religious, beliving, or praying kind of way. That stuff is just an expression.|`|hiCSVwchaa	I don't pray to god(s).  Ever.  <br>  <br>  Even when I was mugged at knifepoint two months ago and feared for my life.<br>  <br>  The no atheists in foxholes idiom is an offensive myth.|`|0hdo4WORaa	Your friend is most likely lying, it's what you Christians do best|`|AA12360579	I've been guilty of this in my past.  When I was scared for the life of my grandfather, it was more of an "If you're up there..." sort of thing.  Keep in mind that I was about thirteen and still unsure of myself and my beliefs.  I haven't prayed since.<br>  <br>  It looks to me like he was just saying common phrases, no reason to doubt his beliefs.  Either he's 100% atheist and simply spewing out common phrases in his fear, or he's borderline agnostic and saying those things just in case.<br>  <br>  I say things like "Oh my God" or "Good Lord" or whatever all the time.  It's not that I'm acknowledging a deity, I'm just expressing my frustration.|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	I've had a gun pointed at my face.  I didn't pray.<br>  <br>  Not everyone prays.  Even if your story is true -- does it really reflect what he believes or was it a moment of panic?<br>  <br>  What a person says in a moment of stress is often more culturally ingrained than a truthful representation of their thoughts.|`|EepiLrmZaa	god is not real.  the supernatural was invented by neanderthal man. cro-mags learned it from him. god and the supernatural were invented by cave men as a way to explain the things their primitive minds could not explain. these early people lived life on the edge every day. some days they ate the bear. other days the bear ate them. not much has changed.|`|b32jC7pGaa	Your friend is pulling your leg, just as you are trying to pull ours. Another urban myth propagated for the purpose of propaganda. (Or, in more direct terms, just another 'christian' lie designed to prop up a very silly religion.)|`|vOuSZnKxaa	I can't honestly say I know a lot about ocean waves, but if they were comfortable surfing 25 ft waves, why would 30 ft waves make an "atheist" start praying to a god he doesn't believe in?|`|Ynsow6qbaa	Delicious copy paste propaganda? <br>  <br>  if no he is one of thou "atheist" that hates God and thus is not an atheist.|`|AA10880624	I think you're right. Even if we don't pray formally, we still hope.|`|LsJqpTWsaa	I stubbed my my toe, and yelled "God damnit!" Doesn't mean I am preying.<br>  <br>  This is presuming your not making it up.|`|2hX0tLzIaa	That is just a figure of speech<br>  <br>  Its like saying "Jesus Christ" or   Oh my God.<br>  <br>  Dosent mean anything|`|9onFys4baa	LMAO! I doubt Jesus himself if he were real could actually surf a 30 ft wave!|`|KfzlVZQWaa	His words "Help me God, oh god, oh god." Could just be his way of dealing with the fear of seeing the deadly waves. It's the same as saying "For God's sake" or "God Damn it", even if we don't believe in God. It's a part of language to use the word God without believing in it.<br>  <br>  I find it remarkable that you should think he's religious after an experience like that, and perhaps you're hoping he's religious so that he'll be "saved", or perhaps you're just saying "ha ha atheists you all turn to god when you're in trouble ha ha you're all fools".<br>  <br>  I'm assuming the latter, as R&S seems to attract immaturity like moths to the flame.|`|bbb941465ccc4a1ec3a57d5ff0a4b17baa	It's just a cultural meme, I say "oh god" or "god damn it" all the time, but it implies no belief in any god, it's just a thing to say in certain situations.  I'm sure if I got scared enough I would start saying things like your friend did as well, not out of any belief necessarily, just because those are things that people say when terrified.<br>  And your suggestion that everyone subconsciously believes in your god specifically is actually insulting.  I don't go around saying that all people who claim to be theists really, in their heart, know it's all garbage, after all, they don't depend just on prayer, they go out and actually try to solve problems themselves, which should be unnecessary if their imaginary sky friend were going to jump in and save the day.  I think you have to take what people say about their own beliefs at face value.|`|fNw4wJSGaa	How does your friend translate:<br>  <br>  "Please God, help me God, help me. Oh God, Oh God"<br>  <br>  To mean he's "praying" to a deity? It's just a exclamation uttered in a moment of heightened stress and danger.<br>  <br>  I exclaim "Oh my God!" to things when I'm shocked. I grew up with it. Just like saying "bless you" after someone sneezes.<br>  <br>  Why do believers try so hard and look too deeply into what are obviously just a figure of speech?<br>  <br>  And even if it was a prayer, why does that mean that because ONE atheist you know, might have belief in a God, all of a sudden means to you ALL atheists, or indeed all people, think the same? <br>  <br>  It's not nice to assume.|`|yu53u5TFaa	When I stub my toe I say "god damn it!" What an absurd thing for me to say considering that there is no god! But it's a reflex, you see. I don't think about what I'm going to say as the pain hits me, I just say it.<br>  <br>  The surfing story should show you what belief in God is actually based on. Complete and total fear. The only time it is useful to turn to irrational comfort fantasies is when there is no rational reason to believe that a positive outcome will occur.<br>  <br>  This is the reason religion evolved in the first place. Early humans were obviously both terrified and in awe of a huge, dark, unforgiving world they did not understand. So they imagined that there was actually order and intelligence behind it.|`|2ogimlBxaa	As much as everyone knows Vishnu exists subconsciously and denies it.<br>  <br>  He was scared, that's all.<br>  <br>  However, I have been in a serious car wreck that almost killed me, and the only words out of my mouth when it happened were four letters long.|`|A1yHDCwxaa	I am an atheist, and I can tell you that I certainly do not believe that a God exists. I actually have prayed though, asking God to prove himself to me. I do it once a month. Thus far, I have had no response. <br>  <br>  I don't think he was praying to God. I think he might have been shouting Oh God Oh God! But understand that often times in panic, I yell "great zeus!' Odd habit, I know, but it is what I do, and I certainly do not believe in Zeus.|`|fFmbqLf4aa	the please god help me god etc that your friend described is more from social reasons that he said it. it is along the same lines as when some people hit their thumbs with a hammer the yell out jesus christ. it really means nothing so claiming that atheists who uses phrases like these are actually in denial is a little offensive.|`|i5LDHsHpaa	My father's Jewish (by birth, more technically belief-wise he's atheist) but he still is perfectly fine saying things like, "JESUS CHRIST! I MISSED THAT LEFT TURN!" quite often... Or when he's horrified by something someone has done to another person.<br>  <br>  I think it's a cultural thing.  That's what people said around him growing up, that's what he says.|`|Jt565VJxaa	No. I don't know god exists any more than I don't know faeries exist or Zeus exists. But praying to a God when something goes terribly wrong does as about as much good as sitting down and crying.|`|08ae3d05d7e2c113fc49e08dbdcfa338aa	The question I would ask  him is, are atheist supposed to proselytize lol|`|bVHnNqzBaa	The answer to your question is HUBRIS.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	according to God he put it in every ones heart and conscience.|`|HQrqA2I1aa	its just a figure of speach, please god please help me.<br>  <br>  its wishful thinking.

That vibration could be felt in a number of ways.   There are two basic ways to experience this vibration.   By  devotional path or by knowledge / experiment path.  A true atheist experiences the devine vibration earlier earlier than the theist!  But greatest exception is there should not be any dogmatism or skepticism.   An atheist who wants disprove HIS existence by experimenting himself would really experience HIM at the earliest.|`|iH4HMQEkaa	Since it is impossible for the human mind to fully conceive of the absence of thought (atheistic concept of death). All humans therefore subconsciously believe that life continues after death in some form or another. This is a proven fact by psychologist... so I (being christian) would have to say that you are correct, using the logical method for my conclusion.<br>  <br>  As for my answer from a basic biblical view:<br>  <br>  The bible says that God wrote the law on the hearts of men...|`|B1gHA0MAaa	I think that when we find ourselves in difficult situations it helps to think/know that there is a higher power or something that can save our skins so all feelings of "there is no God" quickly subside.|`|ru8BRGnWaa	If that were true then Hindu surfers would pray to god for help, not sheeva or vishnu... <br>  <br>  All that shows you is either 1) your friend(s) is/are (a) liar(s) or<br>  2) we have a biological innateness to believe that causes have some conscious controller, as that is how our feeble minds understand things. or 3) you have no such friends.|`|M7ZU8VQfaa	I have heard this story from many different people.

It comprises the whole future of<br>  the redeemed (Luke 16:9), and is opposed to "eternal punishment"<br>  (Matt. 19:29; 25:46).

DvQLt59Paa	The dwelling place of God.  This is probably what Paul referred to as the “third heaven” (2 Cor. 12:2). John (Rev. 4:1ff.) was taken up to God’s heaven. This heaven is a specific place where God dwells, as salutation of Jesus’ model prayer indicates (“Our Father who art in heaven” Matt. 6:9). It is in heaven that God sits enthroned (Ps. 2:4; Isa. 66:1); from heaven God renders judgment (Gen. 19:24; Josh. 10:11); but God’s blessings also come from heaven (Exod. 16:4). From heaven God looks down upon His people (Deut. 26:15); from heaven He hears their prayer (Ps. 20:6); He comes down from heaven (Ps. 144:5). It is also in heaven that God’s sovereign plan is established (Ps. 119:89).<br>  The Bible speaks about the occupants of heaven. In the Old Testament the believer looked forward to the future reign of Messiah. For the Jews there were but two ages, the present age and the “age to come”—which was Messiah’s reign on earth. The prophets had much to say about Messiah’s future reign (cf. Isa. 9:6–7; 11:1–16; 25:1–27:13). Although little is said specifically about heaven in the Old Testament, the Old Testament saints went to heaven upon death. A commonly occurring phrase in the Old Testament, “and he was gathered to his people” (cf. Gen. 25:8) suggests immortality.? Old Testament believers did not wait until the ascension of Christ before they could enter God’s presence. This is seen in Matthew 17:1–8 inasmuch as Moses and Elijah came from God’s presence at the transfiguration of Christ. In this present church age, believers immediately go to God’s presence in heaven upon death (Luke 23:43; 2 Cor. 5:8; Phil. 1:23; 1 Thess. 4:14).<br>  The New Jerusalem.  Of considerable importance in the discussion of heaven is the New Jerusalem of Revelation 21–22. Although some suggest this passage refers to the millennium, it should be regarded as the eternal state because the chronology of Revelation 20 suggests this.<br>  In Revelation 21, the final eternal abode for believers is described as “a new heaven and a new earth” (21:1). The old heaven and old earth are renovated by fire (2 Pet. 3:10) because they were the domain of angelic and human rebellion against God. The redeemed believers of all ages will live in the New Jerusalem. Although the New Jerusalem is the home Christ has gone to prepare (John 14:2), it is also the heaven of the eternal state.<br>  An important aspect of heaven will be the intimate, personal fellowship of believers with God (Rev. 20:3–4).? Earth’s sorrows will disappear in heaven; every single tear will be wiped away. <br>  Beauty of the New Jerusalem.  Its brilliance (Rev. 21:9–11). Heaven re flects the brilliant glory of God because of His presence. The glory of the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:11) denotes the Shekinah glory of God illuminating the city. Glory “refers to the shining radiance which comes from the presence and glory of God.”?<br>  Its walls and gates (Rev. 21:12–13). The high wall surrounding the city suggests security.<br>  Its foundation stones (Rev. 21:14). The foundation stones, with the names of the apostles—who are the foundation of the church—suggest the church is also in the New Jerusalem.<br>  Its measurement (Rev. 21:15–18). The New Jerusalem measures 1,500 miles long, wide, and high, possibly in the shape of a cone or pyramid, with God’s throne at the top.<br>  Its adornment (Rev. 21:19–21). It is adorned with brilliant, costly stones, further reflecting the Shekinah glory of God.<br>  Its availability (Rev. 21:22). No longer is there a mediatorial priesthood because every inhabitant has immediate access to God.<br>  Its light (Rev. 21:23). The city is illumined by the Shekinah glory, requiring no celestial lights.<br>  Its purpose (Rev. 21:24–26). The ultimate purpose of the eternal abiding place of believers is to bring glory to their Lord who has provided for their redemption.|`|vxbzE9hNaa	its place where religious folks imagine in their mind,<br>  i cant understand how you can move into your imagination after death!|`|cXXJVz64aa	Whatever you imagination wants it to be, because it isn't real.|`|1IqUbxSOaa	like paradise!<br>  <br>  perfect! awesome!<br>  <br>  no ones brain can not fathom how great it will be|`|QusenkISaa	"This is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent."<br>  <br>  John 17:3<br>  <br>  It will be a place where we grow and grow in our knowledge of our infinite, amazing God!!<br>  <br>  "For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face.

There are some principles that need to be addressed in applying the scriptures.<br>  There are 5 scriptural sources of doctrine and practice:-<br>  <br>  1. Direct commands from the Lord: these are non-negotiable. For example, after the last supper, Jesus gave thanks for bread and wine and shared this with his disciples and said 'do this in remembrance of me' so we must do that, but Jesus didn't specify when or where or with whom. Luke 22 & 1 Corinthians 11.<br>  <br>  2. The example of the apostles. These are good practices to follow. For example, The apostle Paul and the church in Troas broke bread in remembrance of Jesus on the first day of the week (Acts 20) and 1 Corinthians 11 infers that the church in Corinth met on the first day of each week.<br>  <br>  3. Applying scriptural principles to the understanding and conduct of a practice. From 1, we have a command to remember the Lord by sharing bread and wine and reflecting on the sacrifice of his body and blood. From 2, we have an example of this being done weekly on the first day of the week (Sunday). From the stories of Joseph's fellow prisoners and King Mechizedek and many others we gain a greater appreciation of the significance of bread and wine. From 1 Corinthians 11, and Hebrews, we see the remembrance as opening a time of collective worship, bringing sacrifices of praise in Spirit into the Holy place in heaven.<br>  <br>  4.  The scriptural judgement of the elderhood. It is Christ's will that the churches of God are united in Doctrine and practice. In Acts 15 a meeting of elders from churches in many locations is called to answer a question caused by unapproved teachers promoting false teaching. The meeting was held and there was much questioning, prayer, quoting of scripture, and eyewitness accounts. At the end a judgement was agreed, written down and circulated to all the churches so that they would be in unity.<br>  <br>  5. Local judgement. Things for which there is no scriptural mandate, but a decision needs to be made. e.g. From 1 & 2, we have a meeting of the church to remember Jesus with bread and wine on the first day of each week. No start time, or duration is specified in the scripture. For the service to be orderly (as required in 1 Corinthians), a start time and duration need to be agreed and published. <br>  <br>  My personal recommendation of a fellowship of churches which follows the above is the churches of God in the fellowship of His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ.|`|gh6Be2Aoaa	CALVARY CHAPEL's DO! <a href="HTTP://WWW.CALVARYCHAPEL.COM" rel="nofollow">HTTP://WWW.CALVARYCHAPEL.COM</a><br>  <br>  Calvary Chapel has been formed as a fellowship of believers in the Lordship of Jesus Christ. Our supreme desire is to know Christ and be conformed to His image by the power of the Holy Spirit. We are not a denominational church, nor are we opposed to denominations as such, only to their over-emphasis of the doctrinal differences that have led to the division of the Body of Christ.<br>  <br>  We believe the only true basis of Christian fellowship is Christ's Agape love, which is greater than any differences we possess and without which we have no right to claim ourselves Christians.<br>  <br>  We believe worship of God should be spiritual. Therefore, we remain flexible and yielded to the leading of the Holy Spirit to direct our worship.<br>  <br>  We believe worship of God should be inspirational. Therefore, we give great place to music in our worship.<br>  <br>  We believe worship of God should be intelligent. Therefore, our services are designed with great emphasis upon the teaching of the Word of God that He might instruct us how He should be worshipped.<br>  <br>  We believe worship of God should be fruitful. Therefore, we look for His love in our lives as the supreme manifestation that we have truly been worshipping Him.<br>  <br>  We believe in all the basic doctrines of historic Christianity.<br>  <br>  We believe in the inerrancy of Scripture, that the Bible, Old and New Testaments are the inspired, infallible Word of God.<br>  <br>  We believe that God is eternally existent in three distinct persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit.<br>  <br>  We believe that God is the personal, transcendent, and sovereign Creator of all things.<br>  <br>  We believe that Jesus Christ is fully God and fully human, that He was born of a virgin, lived a sinless life, provided for the atonement of our sins by His substitutionary death on the cross, was bodily raised from the dead, ascended back to the right hand of the Father, and ever lives to make intercession for us.<br>  <br>  We believe in the personal, visible, and pre-millennial second coming of Jesus Christ to the earth. He will return with His saints and set up a kingdom of which there will be no end.<br>  <br>  After Jesus ascended to Heaven, He poured out His Holy Spirit on the believers in Jerusalem, enabling them to fulfill His command to preach the Gospel to the entire world, an obligation shared by all believers today.<br>  <br>  We believe that all people are, by nature, separated from God and responsible for their own sin, but that salvation, redemption, and forgiveness are freely offered to all by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. When a person repents of sin and accepts Jesus Christ as personal Savior and Lord, trusting Him to save, that person is immediately born again and sealed by the Holy Spirit, all his/her sins are forgiven, and that person becomes a child of God, destined to spend eternity with the Lord.<br>  <br>  We believe in the gifts of the Holy Spirit mentioned in the Scriptures, and that they are valid for today if they are exercised within the scriptural guidelines. We as believers are to covet the best gifts, seeking to exercise them in love that the whole Body of Christ might be edified. We believe that love is more important than the most spectacular gifts, and without this love all exercise of spiritual gifts is worthless.<br>  <br>  Write the vision and make it plain on tablets that he may run who reads it.

So you had better not punish them for any reason.  In a sense, when you make babies, you are bringing beings into the world who have free will.  Suppose you cannot control your teen: he breaks laws without conscience, rages and spews violence against every person, beats your wife/his mother, crashes your car and when he needs money he pretends to be changed, just to repeat the cycle.  When he is in his late twenties, if he lives that long, he hasn't changed, can you ever disown him?  It's happened and it is defendable.  But a young orphan boy fortunately saves your life and does all your yard-work for free.  He turns out to be so reliable and respectful you adopt him.  Ah, and you even write him into your will when he takes care of you when you are old.  He became a friend to you out of his own free will, in the first place.  Oh, I forgot, you think that the other swine shouldn't be disinherited.  My mistake for taking you for someone who can be reasoned with.  You can fix that and say the question is resolved.  By the way, God has rights and duties as a moral governor.  I hope you don't think it promotes 'freedom' if lawmakers decide to abolish all penalties just because they want to be agreeable.  Even old Darwin stated 'ANY form of government is better than none.'  Laws are consistent with a loving or benevolent rule.  Just laws do not imply tyranny.  A law without a penalty is simply advice.|`|e21a15c26fe150cd05b8f03735e6ce4caa	What kind of God advocates free will?

Not everyone will experience this though and there is always the fact that every one of us has to stand in judgement at the end of our lives.  <br>  <br>  So what might not catch up with you in your living years, might very well catch up with you when you leave this planet.<br>  <br>  I guess too that without guidelines, what sort of world would we live in?|`|QF4W5aYRaa	Freedom isn't free.

We left no survivors. 35 But the livestock and the plunder from the towns we had captured we carried off for ourselves. 36 From Aroer on the rim of the Arnon Gorge, and from the town in the gorge, even as far as Gilead, not one town was too strong for us. The LORD our God gave us all of them. 37 But in accordance with the command of the LORD our God, you did not encroach on any of the land of the Ammonites, neither the land along the course of the Jabbok nor that around the towns in the hills.<br>  <br>  <br>  Dont doubt the lord your god, he'll **** you and your atheist babies to hell|`|8SOjngS0aa	God gives us free will because he doesn't FORCE us to love Him.

Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors.

The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

The books of the New Testament were written by EYE WITNESSES.   That's why they matter.  <br>  <br>  "Some guy" didn't call God the Father.  Christ did, actually.  <br>  <br>  Many people believe that Mary is the feminine side of Christianity.  Some call the Holy Spirit "she".  <br>  <br>  Christ was speaking to a people in an era where women had little power.  No one would have listened to a female disciple.  So the men who lived and traveled with Jesus are called disciples, but if you read the Gospels you see that there were many women in the group too: Mary and Martha, and Mary Jesus' mother...  <br>  <br>  However, the early Christians did treat women as important equals in spreading the gospel - for example Paul speaks of a woman teacher amongst them.   Also, you need to know that women found Christ's tomb empty, and women were the first to witness the resurrected Christ.  They did and do have an important place in the story.<br>  <br>  Many Christian ministers do refer to God occasionally as She.|`|hms0bSiaaa	All Scripture is "God-breathed" and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness. (2 Timothy 3:16)<br>  <br>  For prophesy NEVER had its origin in the will of man, but men spoke FROM GOD as they were carried along BY the Holy Spirit. (2 Peter 1:21)<br>  <br>  Preach the Word; be prepared in season and out of season, correct, rebuke and encourage with great patience and careful instruction. (2 Timothy 4:2)<br>  <br>  Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. (1Peter 3:15-16)<br>  <br>  The Word of God is the "sword" of the Spirit.  (Ephesians 6:17)<br>  <br>  My son, if you accept my Words and store up my commands within you, turning your ear to wisdom and applying your heart to understanding...........(Proverbs 2:1-6)<br>  <br>  You see, the Bible is the very mind of God and it is the operation instruction manual of the Maker to the product (man). So the Word of God or the Holy Bible is our light in this darkened world,  it is the hope for our<br>  hopelessness and it is the wisdom for our foolishness. From the Bible we can learn the origin of man and his divine purpose here on earth. And the most important thing about the Bible is that we can find the source, THE only Source (Jesus) of our salvation.<br>  <br>  Have you accepted Jesus? Would you like to have assurance of eternal life? Then pray this prayer:<br>  <br>  "Lord, I realize I am a sinner.  I believe Your Son, Jesus Christ, died on the Cross for my sins. Please forgive me of my sins as I open my heart to Him so that He may become my Lord, God and <br>  Savior.  Please make me a new person as I commit my life to You today. Thank you for giving me Your Holy Spirit. Amen"<br>  <br>  If you pray this prayer from the heart, rest assured that you will spend eternity in Heaven with God.<br>  <br>  You can find a Bible-believing and Christ-centered church in your locality and you can fellowship with them as you grow as a Christian. <br>   <br>  God bless you.

cpOtr6Thaa	The first heaven is the firmament. This heaven is the closest to the Earth.<br>  <br>      [Genesis 1:8] “And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the morning were the second day.”  The Bible also, refers this heaven as the sky.<br>  <br>      [Matthew 16:2] “He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It will be fair weather: for the sky is red.”<br>  <br>  The second heaven is the space is where the sun, moon and stars are located.<br>  <br>      [Deuteronomy 4:19] “And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the Lord thy God hath divided unto all nations under the whole heaven. The plural form of “heavens” quite often is in reference to the stars beyond this solar system: the myriad of galaxies in the universe.<br>  <br>      [Job 26:13] "By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath formed the crooked serpent."<br>  <br>  The third heaven is the location of God's throne: situate to the utter most north from the earth. According to the Apostle Paul he was caught up to the third heaven.<br>  <br>      [2 Corinthians 12:2] “I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knoweth;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.”<br>  <br>  The location of this heaven “in the sides of the north” is shown in Scripture in Isaiah 14:13 in the rebellion of Satan. "For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven, I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:”|`|Yoeu9iHpaa	Actually, according to the Bible, there are 3 levels of Heaven.

So, that means Jesus had at least 6 siblings. <br>  <br>  James and Jude, whose letters are part of the scriptures, are 2 of the brothers. <br>  <br>  Since Joseph is not mentioned during the ministry, he may have already died. (In Jewish culture of that time period, most men did not marry until their late 20s or early 30.) Providing for a family of this size, he may have died in his late 50s. Carpentry at this time was without power tools, and may even included cutting trees and preparing lumber. <br>  <br>  Jesus would have to be the man of the household up to the time of the start of his ministry. His brothers would have been in the 20 to 30 age range at that time.|`|AA10460376	YES....Joseph could not commsemate his marriage to Mary until after Jesus was born....They had other children some time later after Jesus was born......But Jesus did not consider "BLOOD" relatives as necessarily his family because he did everything that was pleasing to GOD and did not get caught up into sister/brother bonds the way we would do...Jesus felt that anyone who was doing the WILL of HIS FATHER in HEAVEN was his BROTHER.......He absolutely allowed NO MAN to come between the relationship between him and GOD....|`|AA10034051	Because most people take one verse out of context. They fail to realize who is being spoken of in the verses below. <br>  James and Joses are in Matthew, Mark, and John's Gospels referred to as the sons of Mary the wife of Clophas (Matthew 27:55, Mark 15:40, and John 19:25). Many early Church historians believe that Clophas and Joseph, Jesus' foster-father, were either brothers or cousins. Regardless, it does refer to Mary the wife of Clophas as the sister of Mary the mother of Jesus. <br>  <br>  We can cross Simon off the list because Mark 3:18 tells us he is a Canaanite, "And Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Canaanite..."<br>  <br>  Jude, we are told in Jude 1:1, is the "servant of Jesus Christ and the brother of James."<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  "Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and the brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon, and are not his sisters here with us?" Mark 6:3-4<br>  "Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary? And are not his brethren James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? And are not all his sisters with us?" Matthew 13:55-56<br>  <br>  <br>  Having been enlightened by an angel in a dream regarding her pregnancy, and perhaps further by Mary concerning the words of the archangel Gabriel to her at the Annunciation, Joseph knew that God had conducted himself as a husband in regard to Mary. She was now prohibited to him for all time, and for the sake of the Child and Mary he could only live with her in an absolutely chaste relationship. <br>  <br>  Living a celibate life within marriage was not unknown in Jewish tradition. It was told that Moses, who was married, remained continent the rest of his life after the command to abstain from sexual intercourse (Ex 19:15) given in preparation the seventy elders abstained thereafter from their wives after their call, and so did Eldad and Medad when the spirit of prophecy came upon them; indeed it was said that the prophets became celibate after the Word of the Lord communicated with them (Midrash Exodus Rabbah 19; 46.3; Sifre to Numbers 99 sect. 11; Sifre Zutta 81-82, 203-204; Aboth Rabbi Nathan 9, 39; Tanchuman 111, 46; Tanchumah Zaw 13; 3 Petirot Moshe 72; Shabbath 87a; Pesachim 87b, Babylonian Talmud).<br>  <br>  <br>  Joseph as celibate caretaker<br>  <br>  As the recipient of the great revelation that what was conceived in the womb of Mary, his betrothed, was of the Holy Spirit and that the Child to be born was destined to save His people from their sins, surely Joseph knew that he was called to take care of Mary and her Child, the Messiah, for the rest of his life, which is why the angel told him to take Mary as his wife. <br>  <br>  We may reasonable assume that Mary herself now shared with him all that the archangel Gabriel said to her. No less a Person than "the Son of God" (Lk 1:35) was to be entrusted to his care under the shelter of his humble home, now become the Holy of Holies.<br>  <br>  Jesus was an only child, the Blessed Virgin did not give birth to any other children|`|96cd1744acaf1e87751ac1ec9c729b19aa	No dear. <br>  And she got pregnant after a brief and splendid encounter with Gabriel, a beoutiful young stud teenager full of hormones.

Mary described herself as "the handmaid of the Lord" in Luke, and as the handmaid of the Lord, she remained sinless. <br>  <br>  Joseph would never have violated her in such a fashion.<br>  <br>  Many Protestants like to point out that the Bible says that Joseph did not know her "until she had given birth to her firstborn son" to prove that Mary both had normal relations with Joseph and that she had other children besides Jesus. However, what they fail to take into account is that "firstborn son" is simply a legal term, that "brothers and sisters" meant not just siblings, but all close relatives or close friends, and that the word "until" does not mean that they had sex afterwards.<br>  <br>  After all, if you take your car to a mechanic, and you tell the mechanic, "I didn't mess with it until it started smoking," does that mean you messed with it after it started smoking? No. It just means you didn't mess with it up until that point. Also, when you say "from the beginning until now, there has been no stop to the fighting," are you saying that the fighting has stopped? No. It is still going on, isn't it? <br>  <br>  There are absolutely no indications in the Bible that Mary ever had other children. If she had, one of those children would have taken Mary into their home instead of the disciple John.|`|srUuoCwcaa	Colette is correct.<br>  <br>  Catholicism/Eastern Orthodoxy and most Protestants diverge on this issue.<br>  <br>  The former say that Mary was a Virgin before, during, and after the conception of Christ. In fact, the Catechism of the Catholic Church states: "Christ's birth 'did not diminish his mother's virginal integrity but sanctified it.' And so the liturgy of the Church celebrates Mary as Aeiparthenos, the 'Ever-virgin.'" (499) Likewise, Eastern Orthodoxy has a long-standing tradition regarding the veneration of Mary as the "Theotokos" (meaning "God-bearer," or, more commonly in the West, "the Mother of God"). Both see the Blessed Virgin as enjoying a special privilege of grace and purity as a result of her wholly unique position as such. That said, the Orthodox would no more than their Catholic counterparts dare to say that Mary's giving birth to the Christ-child diminished in any way her "virginal intergrity," because it is precisely by her divine offspring that she is glorified. As the concept of Christ's divinity became solidified in the early councils of the Church, and as (correspondingly) the emphasis on his true Virgin Birth enjoyed greater prestige, the fullness of his Mother's bodily and spiritual purity were affirmed in honorific titles such as "Ever-virgin" (and, in the West, "Immaculate Conception), etc. <br>  <br>  Protestants generally do not regard Mary as highly. The compromise of her virginity after the birth of Christ holds fewer overarching implications for these groups. Some, such as the Presbyterians, do not even hold that Christ drew his humanity from Mary--but rather that she acted more as a surrogate mother for him. (Catholics and Orthodox would find this proposition troubling, for it would seem in their eyes to degrade the mystery of the hypostatic union; traditionally, Mary had been regarded as the source of Christ's human nature, just as the Father was viewed as the source of his divine nature). Since the majority of these same groups teach that Mary was a sinful human being, these sentiments are understandable. They simply don't shock Protestants like they might a Catholic or an Orthodx.<br>  <br>  Ultimately, the argument rests on the fact that the scriptures describe the "brethren of the Lord," James, Simon, and Jude. Traditionally, the first and the last are identified with James the Apostle and Thaddeus Jude (also an apostle), respectively. There are scriptural reasons for this (such as the fact that St. Paul refers to James, the "brother of the Lord," as "an apostle," despite the fact that the gospels list the parents of the so-named apostles). Etc. It can get very confusing. It boils down to this: the Greek word used (adelphoi) can be used simply to express kinship. For instance, when the gospels talk about Christ speaking to his "brethren" and being rejected, it's clear that the reference is to the Jewish people at large. Likewise, in Christ's day, to refer to a cousin or uncle as "adelphoi" (brother) wouldn't have been uncommon. As a result of this linguistic technicality, a long-standing tradition regarding the appropriately "triune" Holy Family (Jesus, Mary, and Joseph), the writings of the Church Fathers, etc., the Catholic Church (and Eastern Orthodoxy, with a more or less similar line of reasoning) has dismissed such biblical references as misinterpreted, and such individuals are usually identified as first-cousins of Christ.<br>  <br>  Protestants, on the other hand, look at "adelphoi" more literally. Since this group is less tradition-based, the document should, in their view, be allowed to speak for itself. Since the clear and literal meaning is deducible, that's what most opt for in these groups. (Occasionally, certain less common interpretations, rarely but sometimes evoked in Catholic circles as well, look at these aforementioned individuals as sons of Joseph from a previous marriage, holding to the notion that he was a widower--and there is a basis for this belief, but it has its own history and isn't worth getting into here.)<br>  <br>  Suffice to say, there are many different angles from which to approach this question. Since I think the Protestant explanation is a little more simplistic (though not necessarily more justified), I've attached a link I found that may be helpful in weighing both sides.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|SYwk01qxaa	Jesus had half- siblings, same mom.|`|Hjwp1yGWaa	Always sowing tares aren't you?

( Mark 6: 3 ). <br>  Jesus even had a cousin : John the Baptist, Mary was kin to Elizabeth ( John the Baptist's mother ), the wife to Zechariah the  priest before God.<br>  Joseph was engaged to Mary while she was still a virgin, and the Holy Spirit of the Lord was the Father of Jesus  Mary said I am a servant of the Lord. Let this happen to me" she told the angel Gabriel.<br>  <br>  . Her cousin Elizabeth was 6-months pregnant with John the Baptist. The day that Mary became pregnant with Jesus, she went to visit her cousin Elizabeth. She came to Zechariah's house and greeted Elizabeth. When the unborn John the Baptist leaped in Elizabeth's womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit  ( Luke 1 : 34-45 ).<br>  <br>  <br>  Mary was still engaged to Joseph when she gave birth to Jesus ( Luke 2: 5 ). Joseph took Mary as his wife, but he did not have sexual relations with her until she gave birth to Jesus ( Matthew 1: 25-25 ).<br>  During Biblical days, betrothals and engagements were taken seriously, no premarital sex. Joseph almost didn't marry Mary when he found out about her pregnancy. Back then, an unmarried woman being pregnant, would be stoned to death under Rabbinic Laws, so Joseph protected her. Joseph was step-father, a carpenter and raised Jesus as his own, and taught Jesus his trade ( carpentry ).|`|7cLSTtdzaa	Actually, Mary was a virgin all her life. Even after she had Jesus, she remained a virgin, so that is why she has one of the highest positions in Heaven. She was never "touched" by a man. Scholars say that a soul was blown into her when she getting pregnant with Jesus.|`|8465ed09a7111e9ef73563fd6ed0ec22aa	God's economy of "the sacred" explains why Mary had to be immaculately conceived (and also explains the other Marian doctrines of the virgin birth, perpetual virginity, and assumption into heaven. <br>  This economy that is the foundation of the Marian doctrines is taught in the Old Testament and in the New. While these Marian dogmas are not explicitly stated in the bible they are implied in the bible and further, are derived from Biblical principle. <br>  First we must remember that St. John said in John 21:25 that not everything that Jesus taught was written down. Not every teaching was put into the Bible. St. Paul affirms this when he says in 1 Cor 11:2 and 2 Thess 2:15 to hold fast to the Traditions (that is God's Revealed Revelation) whether oral Tradition or written Tradition (the Bible is "written" Tradition and Tradition means Divine Teaching. It does not mean customs or man-made rules. It is referring to the Word of God.) <br>  Thus, it is not necessary for a particular doctrine to have a Biblical Reference. With that said, nearly all of the dogmas of the Catholic Church, including the Immaculate Conception, has either a direct teaching, or an indirect/implied teaching, or a direct reference, or an indirect/implied reference in Scripture. <br>  In this case the Immaculate Conception is implied primarily by Genesis 3:15 and Luke 1:28. <br>  It is implied in Genesis 3:15: "I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel". <br>  Here we see the foreshadowing of Mary's fiat in Luke 1:28. Where Eve had failed, Mary passed. Through Eve original sin had its birth; through the Blessed Virgin, redemption gave its birth. <br>  Thus Mary bruises the head of the devil. She is victorious. The implication the Church has always taught is that Mary is the new Eve, the mother of the redeemer, who shares (by anticipation and pre-eminently) in the victory of her Son. By that, sin never left its mark on her and the Church calls her the Immaculate Conception. <br>  The Immaculate Conception is also implied in Luke 1:28: " And he came to her and said, "Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with you!" <br>  The "full of grace" greeting was a most unusual one. It reveals the special honor and dignity given to Mary. She is NOT, however, merely a "favored one". She is FULL of grace, not 99% full, but 100% full. No other human being has ever been 100% full of grace except Jesus. The rest of us all have original sin to contend with and a human nature prone to sin. We will not receive our glorified bodies in which we will have 100% fullness of grace until after we have passed from this material world. But Mary has this fullness now. <br>  The Fathers and Doctors of the Church "taught that this singular, solemn and unheard-of greeting showed that all the divine graces reposed in the Mother of God and that she was adorned with all the gifts of the Holy Spirit", which meant that she "was never subject to the curse", that is, was preserved from all sin. These words of the archangel in this text constitute one of the sources which reveal the dogma of Mary's immaculate conception (cf. Pius IX, Ineffabilis Deus; Paul VI, Creed of the People of God) <br>  Then we have the phrase, "The Lord is with you!" Notice that this was NOT the typical greeting of, "the Lord BE with you", but a specific affirmation, "the Lord IS with you". <br>  St. Augustine comments about the archangel saying this: "He is more with you than he is with me: he is in your heart, he takes shape within you, he fills your soul, he is in your womb" (Sermode Nativitate Domini, 4) <br>  This gives us insight to another factor of who Mary is. Mary is the TABERNACLE of God. Her womb is the Tabernacle, the place of abode of God, where God chooses to rest himself. Because Mary is the Tabernacle of God her womb MUST be pure and stainless. We learn this from the Old Testament. <br>  The tabernacle where God's presence resided before the nation of Israel was a place "set aside" (blessed) and made pure. The Ark of the Covenant itself was made of the purest materials and could not be allowed to be contaminated by any means. It could not be touched by unconsecrated hands. We know of the story of when then Ark was brought to the temple. In the procession it began to fall. A soldier naturally reached out and touched the Ark to keep it from falling. He was struck dead. Although he did a good deed, although he did what was natural to do, his touch to the Ark, the Ark that must be pure, unblemished, and untouched, caused his immediate death. <br>  Mary, to carry the presence of God in her womb, must also be without blemish and be untouched for her womb is the Ark of the New Covenent in the same way the Ark of the Old Testament was the Ark of the Covenent with Moses. <br>  Even after the birth of Jesus, she must remain unblemished and untouched (she did not have children after Jesus).

Whoever shall faithfully serve me by the recitation of the Rosary shall receive signal graces.<br>  2. I promise my special protection and the greatest graces to all those who shall recite the Rosary.<br>  3. The Rosary shall be a powerful armor against Hell, it will destroy vice, decrease sin, and defeat heresies.<br>  4. It will cause virtue and good works to flourish; it will obtain for souls the abundant mercy of God; it will withdraw the hearts of men from the love of the world and its vanities and will lift them to the desire of eternal things. Oh, that souls would sanctify themselves by this means.<br>  5. The soul which recommends itself to me by the recitation of the Rosary, shall not perish.<br>  6. Whoever shall recite the Rosary devoutly, applying himself to the consideration of its sacred mysteries, shall never be conquered by misfortune. God will not chastise him in His justice, he shall not perish by an unprovided death; if he be just, he shall remain in the grace of God and become worthy of eternal life.<br>  7. Whoever shall have a true devotion for the Rosary shall not die without the Sacraments of the Church.<br>  8. Those who are faithful to recite the Rosary shall have during their life and at their death the light of God and the plenitude of His graces; at the moment of death, they shall participate in the merits of the saints in Paradise.<br>  9. I shall deliver from Purgatory those who have been devoted to the Rosary.<br>  10. The faithful children of the Rosary shall merit a high degree of glory in Heaven.<br>  11. You shall obtain all you ask of me by the recitation of the Rosary.<br>  12. All those who propagate the Holy Rosary shall be aided by me in their necessities.<br>  13. I have obtained from my Divine Son that all the advocates of the Rosary shall have for intercessors the entire Celestial Court during their life and at the hour of death.<br>  14. All who recite the Rosary are my sons, and brothers of my only Son, Jesus Christ.<br>  15. Devotion to my Rosary is a great sign of predestination.<br>  <br>  God bless!<br>  Dave|`|JL8KpDYnaa	yes it is ironic that unbelievers consider themselves good people.|`|dZMHd5PMaa	Isn't it ironic how people will pigeon hole just b/c they don't agree with someones view point|`|8Hj9oxVDaa	not really suprised.|`|WcuU7IZ7aa	what's your point? yeah  they have faults.

I am sure He started a great deal more than 6000 years ago.   My beliefs on this are consistent with the teachings of the Catholic Church.  <br>  <br>  I think it is unreasonable for proponents of various theories of evolution to act like their ideas are entirely complete and proven.   The fossil records are intriguing,  but they have more missing pieces than actual solid evidence.  I think some form of evolution has occurred,  but I don't believe unintelligent evolution could produce all of the billions of life forms that have come into existence in only a few billion years.   It is not proper scientifically to consider something settled when it simply is not settled.   <br>  <br>  For unintelligent evolution to produce all of the kinds of   bacteria, kangaroos, butterflies, snakes, birds, and all other living things in only a few billion years,  the successive changes would have to occur so rapidly that we should see more evidence of it in recorded history.   If evolution is part of the explanation for the origin of all species,  then the rest of the explanation is that God has been the cause of the evolution.<br>  <br>  With God, evolution is possible - even likely,  but without God, evolution seems to me to be an extremely remote improbability.|`|AypSdbwzaa	Long questions can get a bit muddled, but I think I can answer this.<br>  <br>  Sometimes you get an answer you don't understand and aren't sure how to research.

Evolution has been debunked by many scientific minds:<br>  There are only two possibilities.  Either every part of every living thing arose by random chance, or an intelligence designed them.  It is now clear that the theory of evolution's only mechanism for building new parts and creatures, mutation-natural selection, is totally, utterly, pathetically inadequate.  In spite of overwhelming evidence that the theory of evolution is dead wrong, many are not ready to throw in the towel.  They desperately hope that some natural process will be found that causes things to fall together into organized complexity.  These are people of great faith.  And they are so afraid of connecting God with science that, like the Japanese Army of World War II, they would rather die than surrender.  Unfortunately, the staunchest defenders sit in places of esteem and authority as professors, scientists, and editors, and have the full faith of the news media.  The public is naturally in awe of their prestige.  But once the facts are understood it becomes obvious that the theory of evolution is long overdue for the trash can, and to perpetuate it is a fraud.  Perhaps it made sense for what was known when The Origin of Species was published in 1859, but not today.<br>  If you are interested in the sceptics list of noteworthy people here is the web site.<br>  <a href="http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/filesDB-download.php?command=download&id=660" rel="nofollow">http://www.discovery.org/scripts/viewDB/...</a><br>  In Jesus' Love<br>  Robert <t><<br>  <a href="http://freecounselfreelight.homestead.com/Roberts.html" rel="nofollow">http://freecounselfreelight.homestead.co...</a><br>  tgmpray@yahoogroups.com|`|ORDjVHY4aa	I have studied both Evolution and Creation, and i think Creation is much more believable, I don't claim to know everything about evolution, as you don't know everything about creation. In truth we may never be able to prove scientifically which is correct. You use your information you are taught and evidence you see to believe in evolution. I do the same to believe in creation. Evolutionists want to harbor the idea that everything happened naturally by chance over billions of years. I believe that God created everything in 6 literal days. You can't prove your right or that i'm wrong. <br>  Why is it a big deal?  Just because evolutionists say that is how it happened doesn't make it true. If you truly are a scientist you will know there are many theories that seem true at first and then are found to be false. What if evolution is the same(not microevolution)<br>  as those other false theories.  Shouldn't there be a debate, and research looking into other possibilities.  The more evolutionists find results, they prove themselves wrong, and are backtracking constantly.<br>  for example, the femur of a T-Rex found with soft tissue and actual blood vessels intact.  135 million years old?  Sure they will come up with an explanation, but that doesn't mean they are right.  <br>  All most true YEC's want are for the the parts of evolution that are not fact to be taught as just that. theories.|`|dZMHd5PMaa	The same reason that someone who believes whole heartedly in evolution isn't going to believe what a creationist has to say. It all comes down to what you believe in your heart of hearts. I don't believe in evolution and I never will believe in evolution no matter how much "scientific" fact is thrown at me. I could probably pick it apart with my beliefs just the same as you are able to pick apart creationism with your beliefs. If you truly believe something then nothing is going to change your mind.|`|X9rXRNUxaa	.<br>  It all boils down to WHO you believe - God, who created everything, or<br>  some man who is paid to say what he is saying !<br>  <br>  I believe the Bible and God, and if anything does not agree with this,<br>  it is not worth knowing !<br>  <br>  May God bless you as you study His Word<br>  <br>  <:)))><
kclpa0Abaa	Just think.<br>  <br>  Hmmm...<br>  <br>  Why do people(straight usually) decide to get married?<br>  <br>  And that's your answer.<br>  <br>  Civil Unions DO NOT have the same rights as marriage. Pay close attention. This is why history is taught, if you ever question it. Seperate but equal has never been equal. Civil Unions do not provide federal marraige rights, which are the bulk of the rights. They only exist on a state level.|`|NwXnzARwaa	There are 1,049 benefits, rights, and privileges only offered through legal marriage.

It's clean, no need to create new hybrid legal relationships and it works in terms of social equality. <br>  <br>  I leave with a quote: "Don't want gay marriage?

People want to get MARRIED... not "union'd"! Especially if you're gay and also Christian or part of a religion where marriage is a big deal.<br>  <br>  Like other said, it's not the same thing. Marriage is a deal handled by the STATE... the only reasons against gay marriage are from the CHURCH. In American, there's the Separation of Church and State-- so they need to just legalize it and keep the Church out of State business. If churches don't want to perform ceremonies for gay people, that's their own choice, but they should NOT be allowed to strip people of the right to actually marry. <br>  <br>  Oi.

Imagine if parents didn't force their kids to go to school or didn't force them to take a bath.  You'd have a bunch of smelly stupid kids running around.  Parents are responsible for the things that influence their kids.  People like the term "brainwashing" without really knowing how it really works.  Brainwashing goes beyond simply forcing someone to go somewhere once a week for a long time.  Obviously you still have choices and options available to you even though you were forced to go to church until 18.

I can't say what I would do and I have sympathy for someone in this situation.

AA10985325	Yes...for the past 37 years.<br>  Obviously from my viewpoint, it works. <br>  <br>  Here’s a factual description of the Scientology religion for you: <br>  <br>  Scientology is a new religion. It is an applied religious philosophy. By “applied” is meant that it is for use in life and  living. You actually use it in your day to day life to change and improve existing conditions. It is a practical religion.<br>  All religions if you study them have a basic philosophy, but they also have certain dogma, rituals and observances and a certain faith or belief is required. There is nothing wrong with this , but Scientology is not that kind of religion. It acknowledges the principle of God or the Supreme Being but does not try to define or describe this principle,  leaving it up to the individual.<br>  It is also not a messianic religion. This means there is no worship of prophets or messiahs or gods. It is not belief or faith based. In Scientology a truth is true for you according to your own observation and experience .<br>  The dictionary definition that applies:<br>  <br>  Religion: The spiritual or emotional attitude of one who recognises the existence of superhuman power or powers.<br>  <br>  The most basic principle of Scientology is that YOU are your own immortal soul, that this is not a thing you have but what YOU actually are.<br>  Scientology believes or considers that Man is basically good. This is different from many religions that promote that he his natively evil or bad unless “made” good.<br>  <br>  The whole purpose of Scientology knowledge application and procedure is to increase an individual’s understanding and awareness of himself as a spiritual being and to rehabilitate his native abilities and potential.<br>  When you do this there sphere and zones of his positive influence increases and moves outward into his life , his family and friends, his groups and Mankind of which he is part .<br>  <br>  How this result is achieved is the “technology” of Scientology, which was developed by L Ron Hubbard from discoveries he made after  extensive research into the field of the mind and the human spirit.<br>  Some of this knowledge was already existing in the sacred lore of ancient texts like the Veda or Vedic Hymns going back 10,000 years. New and additional discoveries were  made about the nature of the human spirit and fully recorded and codified .<br>  Scientology’s closest spiritual ties with any other religion are with Orthodox (Hinayana ) Buddhism with which it shares an historical lineage. But even here the relationship is based mainly on friendship and the recognition of the being as a spirit rather than any organizational ties.<br>  <br>  L.Ron Hubbard published 18 basic books from 1950 to 1955 to fully communicate the basic principles of Scientology, the path of his research and the technology that  he developed from this. <br>  He completed all his research before his death in 1986 and left all his materials and copyrights to the Church of Scientology’s Religious Technology Centre along with most of his personal estate when he died.<br>  <br>  The Church of Scientology is currently established iand operating internationally in over 160 countries world wide. However it is still a new religion, less than 55 years old.<br>  The true story of Scientology as a religion goes like this:<br>  1. A philosopher developes a philosophy about life and death.<br>  2. People find it interesting.<br>  3. People find it works.<br>  4. People pass it along to others.<br>  5. It grows.<br>  <br>  This is just an overview.<br>  L.Ron Hubbard explained fully the theology and technologies of Scientology in more than 500,000 pages of writings, including dozens of books and over 3,000 tape recorded public lectures. So it’s not possible to fully answer your question on this forum, but I hope  this helps.<br>  <br>  If you are still curious I recommend reading some basic books on Scientology. <br>  They're all in your local library, religions section,  author L.Ron Hubbard|`|5yWkjp9baa	As a regular poster in this forum, I've been a Scientologist for nearly 38 years now.

srUuoCwcaa	"Mary Within" is a lovely little gem that my godmother lent to me. It's by a former Catholic priest turned Jungian psychotherapist. It deals chiefly with Mary as the latest incarnation, so to speak, of the Great Mother archetype, essentially present throughout all of history (Venus, Kali, Isis, etc.) <br>  <br>  Drawing from Christian tradition, which has oftentimes viewed her as the fullness of the Old Testament figure of Wisdom, or holy Sophia, it dares to address her as the archetypal "goddess" figure--as the nurturant maternal figure deeply imbedded in the human psyche. It draws from various religious and psychological sources, and ultimately affirms her as a picture of our own dormant potential.<br>  <br>  I found it quite a wonderful read and feel much more connected to the Great Mother as a result. Seeing Mary in all her archetypal, multi-dimensional splendor really helped to expand my thinking and veneration as a "Universal" Catholic. I feel confident now more than ever that my perpetual trust in Our Lady is ultimately both Self-affirming and Self-realizing. In so doing, I am implicitly honoring my own feminine energies and potentials.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. : )|`|QF4W5aYRaa	Not aware of any, if there are, they are false, she is NOT a goddess, she was a human woman, just like you, the Catholic faith puts WAY too much emphasis on her.|`|AA11427203	"The Virgin: Mary's Cult and the Re-emergence of the Goddess "<br>  by Geoffrey Ashe|`|8465ed09a7111e9ef73563fd6ed0ec22aa	Whenever one encounters a proposed example of pagan influence, one should demand that its existence be properly documented, not just asserted. The danger of accepting an inaccurate claim is too great. The amount of misinformation in this area is great enough that it is advisable never to accept a reported parallel as true unless it can be demonstrated from primary source documents or through reliable, scholarly secondary sources. After receiving documentation supporting the claim of a pagan parallel, one should ask a number of questions:<br>  <br>  1. Is there a parallel? Frequently, there is not. The claim of a parallel may be erroneous, especially when the documentation provided is based on an old or undisclosed source.<br>  <br>  For example: "The Egyptians had a trinity. They worshiped Osiris, Isis, and Horus, thousands of years before the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost were known" (Robert Ingersoll, Why I Am an Agnostic). This is not true. The Egyptians had an Ennead—a pantheon of nine major gods and goddesses. Osiris, Isis, and Horus were simply three divinities in the pantheon who were closely related by marriage and blood (not surprising, since the Ennead itself was an extended family) and who figured in the same myth cycle. They did not represent the three persons of a single divine being (the Christian understanding of the Trinity). The claim of an Egyptian trinity is simply wrong. There is no parallel.<br>  <br>  2. Is the parallel dependent or independent? Even if there is a pagan parallel, that does not mean that there is a causal relationship involved. Two groups may develop similar beliefs, practices, and artifacts totally independently of each other. The idea that similar forms are always the result of diffusion from a common source has long been rejected by archaeology and anthropology, and for very good reason: Humans are similar to each other and live in similar (i.e., terrestrial) environments, leading them to have similar cultural artifacts and views.<br>  <br>  For example, Fundamentalists have made much of the fact that Catholic art includes Madonna and Child images and that non-Christian art, all over the world, also frequently includes mother and child images. There is nothing sinister in this. The fact is that, in every culture, there are mothers who hold their children! Sometimes this gets represented in art, including religious art, and it especially is used when a work of art is being done to show the motherhood of an individual. Mother-with child-images do not need to be explained by a theory of diffusion from a common, pagan religious source (such as Hislop’s suggestion that such images stem from representations of Semiramis holding Tammuz). One need look no further than the fact that mothers holding children is a universal feature of human experience and a convenient way for artists to represent motherhood.<br>  <br>  3. Is the parallel antecedent or consequent? Even if there is a pagan parallel that is causally related to a non-pagan counterpart, this does not establish which gave rise to the other. It may be that the pagan parallel is a late borrowing from a non-pagan source. Frequently, the pagan sources we have are so late that they have been shaped in reaction to Jewish and Christian ideas. Sometimes it is possible to tell that pagans have been borrowing from non-pagans. Other times, it cannot be discerned who is borrowing from whom (or, indeed, if anyone is borrowing from anyone).<br>  <br>  For example: The ideas expressed in the Norse Elder Edda about the end and regeneration of the world were probably influenced by the teachings of Christians with whom the Norse had been in contact for centuries (H. A. Guerber, The Norsemen, 339f).<br>  <br>  4. Is the parallel treated positively, neutrally, or negatively? Even if there is a pagan parallel to a non-pagan counterpart, that does not mean|`|y9m8Tb93aa	Why pursue a fallacy? Mary is not a goddess - there are no Goddesses.

What you describe is exactly what it means. <br>  <br>  Or would you rather want to impose a ban on these discussions, in the name of "freedom"?<br>  <br>  And why single out Christians and Muslims? Atheists attack the religion of others much more on this forum than these two groups combined.<br>  <br>  Also, the religions (and non-religions moral codes such as humanism) have common themes, but they often are fundamentally contradictory. Therefore (at most) one view can be the truth. Hence, this issue is very much worth debating.<br>  <br>  Personally, if someone think they know something he/she honestly believe to be the truth, and that person honestly believes it to be a matter of life and death, I will hold it against him (or her) if he does not try to convince me (EVEN if I differ with the view). Therefore, I have the utmost respect for such people that are trying to share their views.

Verily We have prepared Hell for the Unbelievers for (their) entertainment.<br>  [103] Say: "Shall we tell you of those who lose most in respect of their deeds?<br>  [104] "Those whose efforts have been wasted in this life. While they thought that they were acquiring good by their works?<br>  [105] They are those who deny the Signs of their Lord and the fact of their having to meet Him (in the Hereafter): vain will be their works, nor shall We, on the Day of Judgment, give them any Weight.”<br>  [al-Kahf 104-105]<br>  <br>  2.

PPwsaeUxaa	Lilith is mythological and does not appear in the Genesis rendition of the Garden of Eden. She is a symbol for the feminist movement as well who hold her up as the disobedient predecessor and alternative to Eve. <br>  <br>  There is a lot of lore associated with the name Lilith.<br>  <br>  Lilith (Hebrew ?????) is a mythological female Mesopotamian storm demon associated with wind and was thought to be a bearer of disease, illness, and death. The figure of Lilith first appeared in a class of wind and storm demons or spirits as Lilitu, in Sumer, circa 4000 BC. Many scholars place the origin of the phonetic name "Lilith" at somewhere around 700 BC despite post-dating even to the time of Moses.[1] Lilith appears as a night demon in Jewish lore and as a screech owl in the King James version of the Bible.<br>  <br>  As for the issue of Lilith in the Bible read this:<br>  <br>  Lilith in the Bible<br>  <br>  The Book of Isaiah 34:14, describing the desolation of Edom, is the only occurrence of Lilith in the Hebrew Bible:<br>  <br>  See the link below for more in-depth information on this. You should really check it out. I've pasted a bit more from there that is very interesting:<br>  <br>  The Alphabet of Ben Sira is considered to be the oldest form of the story of Lilith as Adam's first wife. Whether this particular tradition is older is not known. Scholars tend to date Ben Sira between the 8th and 10th centuries CE. Its real author is anonymous, but it is falsely attributed to the sage Ben Sira. The amulets used against Lilith that were thought to derive from this tradition are in fact, dated as being much older.[34] The concept of Eve having a predecessor is not exclusive to Ben Sira, and is not a new concept, as it can be found in Genesis Rabbah. However, the idea that Lilith was the predecessor is exclusive to Sira. According to Gershom Scholem, the author of the Zohar, R. Moses de Leon, was aware of the folk tradition of Lilith. He was also aware of another story, possibly older, that may be conflicting.[35]<br>  <br>  The idea that Adam had a wife prior to Eve may have developed from an interpretation of the Book of Genesis and its dual creation accounts; while Genesis 2:22 describes God's creation of Eve from Adam's rib, an earlier passage, 1:27, already indicates that a woman had been made: "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them." The text places Lilith's creation after God's words in Genesis 2:18 that "it is not good for man to be alone". He forms Lilith out of the clay from which he made Adam, but the two bicker. Lilith claims that since she and Adam were created in the same way, they were equal, and she refuses to submit to him:<br>  <br>      After God created Adam, who was alone, He said, 'It is not good for man to be alone.' He then created a woman for Adam, from the earth, as He had created Adam himself, and called her Lilith. Adam and Lilith immediately began to fight. She said, 'I will not lie below,' and he said, 'I will not lie beneath you, but only on top. For you are fit only to be in the bottom position, while I am to be the superior one.' Lilith responded, 'We are equal to each other inasmuch as we were both created from the earth.' But they would not listen to one another. When Lilith saw this, she pronounced the Ineffable Name and flew away into the air.<br>  <br>      Adam stood in prayer before his Creator: 'Sovereign of the universe!' he said, 'the woman you gave me has run away.' At once, the Holy One, blessed be He, sent these three angels Senoy, Sansenoy, and Semangelof, to bring her back.<br>  <br>      Said the Holy One to Adam, 'If she agrees to come back, what is made is good. If not, she must permit one hundred of her children to die every day.' The angels left God and pursued Lilith, whom they overtook in the midst of the sea, in the mighty waters wherein the Egyptians were destined to drown. They told her God's word, but she did not wish to return. The angels said, 'We shall drown you in the sea.’<br>  <br>      'Leave me!' she said. 'I was created only to cause sickness to infants. If the infant is male, I have dominion over him for eight days after his birth, and if female, for twenty days.’<br>  <br>      When the angels heard Lilith's words, they insisted she go back. But she swore to them by the name of the living and eternal God: 'Whenever I see you or your names or your forms in an amulet, I will have no power over that infant.' She also agreed to have one hundred of her children die every day. Accordingly, every day one hundred demons perish, and for the same reason, we write the angels' names on the amulets of young children. When Lilith sees their names, she remembers her oath, and the child recovers.<br>  <br>  The background and purpose of The Alphabet of Ben-Sira is unclear.

It is impossible to be weaving the graces of Christ into your character while you are putting all your energies on the side of the world. You may be successful in heaping up treasure on the earth for the glory of self, but "where your treasure is, there will your heart be also" (Matt. 6:21). Eternal considerations will be made of secondary importance. You may take part in the outward forms of worship, but your service will be an abomination to the God of heaven.<br>  <br>       If the eye is single, if it is directed heavenward, the light of heaven will fill the soul, and earthly things will appear insignificant and uninviting. The purpose of the heart will be changed, and the admonition of Jesus will be heeded. You will lay up your treasure in heaven. Your thoughts will be fixed upon the great reward of eternity. All your plans will be made in reference to the future, immortal life. You will be drawn toward your treasure. You will not study your worldly interest, but in all your pursuits the silent inquiry will be, "Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?" (Acts 9:6). Bible religion will be woven into your daily life.

zcwSIBHwaa	In Hinduism, the atman is the soul or eternal self that reincarnates again and again. The speculations in the Upanishads conclude that the Atman is the same as the Brahman (trascendent reality above understanding). <br>  <br>  The Buddha denied the existence of the Atman, and so used the term anatman, or no-self. This is one of the basic principles of Buddhism. Nothing has a lasting self that endures. Everything is temporary and passes away. We don't have an eternal soul. In fact, we don't even have a differentiated self.<br>  <br>  The beliefs of the Jains are similar to those of the Hindus. They believe that each of as has an Atman or divine soul, and we have the potential to achieve God-consciousness.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|4M2eNSb5aa	Existential self is known as atman or soul in these religions.|`|7f0ZVPt8aa	From my understanding in Hinduism atman is the individual soul that is connected to the world or univeral or one soul (Brahman).

Some Orthodox, Catholic, and some Protestant groups believe in head covering all the time.  Head covering was quite the norm in religious settings too up until the 60s.  I think you are making an observation based on secular society as a whole these days and not on the beliefs of Christianity. Christianity is a religion of acceptance and love so no woman is "forced" into wearing modest clothing or head covering, but Christian women are asked to in the Bible (1 Corinthians 11). Only God is the judge though, so please don't judge "all" Christians as being the same. I wouldn't go and say...."All Buddhists are bad because this one Buddhist man was rude to me"....that would just be silly. Every individual is judged for what they do, or don't do, by God and it is not our place...especially since you don't know the hearts or life circumstances of these people that you're judging. In this society many girls are forced to dress provocatively by their parents who will only buy them such clothing, so many people are the product of their circumstances (at least until the age when they can make their own choices for their own reasons...though that is hard to do for some who would prefer to just "go along with the crowd" too). I wish more Christian women would head cover today as well, but not because they are forced to...but for their love for God! God doesn't want us to follow his commandments because we have to; he wants us to make a free and conscious choice to follow his commandments out of love for him. Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  God Bless,<br>  HCG<br>  <br>  PS. It's also a common misconception that "all" Muslim women wear hijab which is just not the case. Many women in Islam decide not to wear the hijab these days too. Head covering and the idea of "submission" on a woman's part is becoming increasingly taboo (due to feminism) in many societies..|`|FFqWeIX7aa	If you are talking about CHRISTIANITY (NOT WESTERN SECULARIST), then, I will quoting Pauline Epistle for that:<br>  ======================================...<br>  1 Corithian 11:<br>  <br>  4 Every man praying or prophesying, having his head covered, dishonoureth his head.<br>  5 But every woman that prayeth or prophesieth with her head uncovered dishonoureth her head: for that is even all one as if she were shaven. <br>  6 For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.<br>  7 For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, forasmuch as he is the image and glory of God: but the woman is the glory of the man. <br>  <br>  13 Judge in yourselves: is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered? <br>  ======================================...<br>  1 Timothy 2:<br>  11 Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.<br>  12 But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.<br>  13 For Adam was first formed, then Eve.<br>  14 And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived was in the transgression.<br>  ======================================...<br>  <br>  Well, in Pauline Christianity,<br>  1.  WOMEN are COMPULSARY to cover their head, because they are images of MEN.<br>  2. They should cover their head during prayer.<br>  3. Women should learn, but in silence, because women are been decieved.<br>  <br>  ======================================...<br>  That is what Christian women should be. But most 'christian' women are just Christian in name. They didn't even follow their own books. <br>  <br>  And loudly say, <br>  1. "Women don't have to wear veils in Christianity (La Nokta Besto)"<br>  <br>  2. "The only place you may still see a veil is in a Church sometimes. In most,( but not all ) a veil is not a requirement of most Christian faiths." - well, did Bible limit that?<br>  <br>  3. "Why do you want to impose your barbaric culture on Western women?" - We are not talking about western, we TALKING ABOUT CHRISTIANS, Differentiate it thy fools!<br>  <br>  4. "A Christian woman walks in the modest beauty of God...we do not need to hide..." - Paul say you should be shorn.<br>  <br>  5. "If you think it's so important for women to wear veils, then maybe you and all the rest of the men should wear them too." - Are you Christian...are you reading 1 Corithian 11?<br>  <br>  6. "For all the women in the world, those veiled most or pretend to be most virtuous are most lecherous." - Whatever, but still, that doesn't mean Christianity ALLOW woman to demostrate their breast. <br>  <br>  p/s: <br>  NOT ALL MUSLIM COVER THEIR BODY, <br>  but AT LEAST, they know that wearing head covering is a compulsion, <br>  rather than say: "It is not compulsary in our religion" <br>  and when they don't wear it, that's between her and god.<br>  <br>  ======================================...<br>  Think, My Women Christians Friends!:<br>  <br>  1 Corithian 11:6 <br>  For if the woman be not covered, let her also be shorn: but if it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her be covered.<br>  ======================================...|`|QS6hSdZNaa	In India men are taught to look at women....Not as an object of sex....but as a mother of someone , a sister of someone, a wife of someone and a daughter of someone.<br>  It is very true that some women display their breasts in a provocative way....such women are not Christians.....they may have a christian sounding name , but in spirit they are NOT christians|`|EAix5Av9aa	In my age this stuff is new<br>   We never had people  or a mosque,hindu temple or otherwise. <br>    People wore close properly and the beach was the only place with 1 piece bikinios.<br>     Only one wife is allowed .

The golden cover belt that encircles the Ka'aba is 47 meters long and 95 centimeters wide and is made up of woven golden pieces of Islamic embellishments. Verses of the Holy Qur'an are stitched on the cover with golden and silver wires. A single Kiswah consumes approximately 670 kilograms of natural silk and has a total measurement of 658 square meters. <br>  <br>  Artisans at the Kiswah Factory are entitle with the EMBROIDERY of the belt, lamps and the curtain that drapes over the Ka'aba door, in addition to the Qur'anic verses printed on the back cloth and other embellishments. They employ the necessary techniques, including stitching and padding and use silver-and gold-coated wires. This process consumes approximately 150 kilograms of gold and silver wire. The 'burqa' (veil) that covers the Ka'aba door is comprised of a piece of pure black silk is 6.5 meters long and 3.5 meters wide; it is emblished with Qu'ranic verses and Islamic designs in gold and silver thread. It is the technicians at the Kiswah Factory who are responsible for stitching the pieces that make up the whole gold and silver designs, including the belt and a section that contains a dedication to the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques His Majesty King Abdullah Bin Abdulaziz, with the date in which it was made inscribed upon it.<br>  <br>  With the passage of time and the progress of the art of weaving and the advancement of technology, the late King Faisal decided to develope the center into a factory that could cope with the Ka'aba's modern needs.

Nkj2UO2Saa	YES. The sabbath day is saturday.<br>  The Sabbath Day Is Saturday<br>  Today, we refer to the days of the week as 'Sundaay, Monday, Tuesday,' and no longer 'the first day, the second day, the third day.' Our present-day system was developed in Rome where people decided to call the first day of the week 'Sunday,' the second day 'Monday,' the third day 'Tuesday,' and the seventh day 'Saturday.' <br>  <br>  1) A calendar week has seven days; Sunday is the first day and Saturday is the seventh day. <br>  <br>  2) Think about the word. "Weekend." Which day does the 'end' of the 'week' indicate? <br>  <br>  3) Even in the dictionary, Sunday is defined as 'the first day of the week,' and Saturday as 'the seventh day of the week.' <br>  <br>  4) The Bible also testifies that the seventh day, the Sabbath day, is Saturday. <br>  <br>  Mark 16:9 (When Jesus rose early on the first day of the week...) <br>  <br>  Jesus resurrected on the first day of the week. No one argues that Jesus resurrected on Sunday-the 'first day of the week'-which is why all Christians now celebrate Resurrection Day on Sunday. In the Good News Bible, this verse is written, 'After Jesus rose from death early on Sunday...' <br>  <br>  Since the first day of the week is Sunday, what day is the seventh day? Through the Bible, we can confirm that the Sabbath day is Saturday. <br>  <br>  <br>  Jesus and His Apostles Kept the Sabbath<br>  The Old Testament is a shadow and a copy of the New Testament. Thus, the law of the Old Testament was a shadow of the good things that were to come in the New Testament times (Heb. 10:1). The Sabbath day in the Old Testament was called "the Sabbath of Jehovah" (Ex. 31:13; Ezek. 20:12), while the Sabbath day in the New Testament was called "the Sabbath of Jesus" (Matt. 12:8; Luke 6:5). <br>  <br>  The Sabbath day, according to the Old Testament law, was only a copy; the Sabbath day of the new covenant, kept in Christ, is the reality. In the New Testament times, the apostles kept the Sabbath day by worshiping God in spirit and in truth, following Jesus Christ's example. Jesus kept the Sabbath as His custom. <br>  <br>  Luke 4:16 『He went to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, and on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue, as was his custom....』 <br>  <br>  In the New Testament times, the Sabbath day is referred to as "Jesus' [the Lord's] day" because the true Lord of the Sabbath is Jesus Christ. "For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath" (Matt. 12:8; Luke 6:5). The apostles kept the Sabbath day as the "Lord's [Jesus'] day." <br>  <br>  Rev. 1:10 『On the Lord's Day I was in the Spirit...』 <br>  <br>  As the times of the Old Testament passed away and the New Testament times began, the way in which God's people were to keep the Sabbath day was changed; however, the day the Sabbath was to be commemorated was never changed. (In the Old Testament times, God's people offered burnt offerings and could not even kindle a fire in their houses, while in New Testament times, people worshipped God in spirit and in truth.) The day itself could not be changed because it was on the seventh day that God had rested from all of His creating work. The apostles kept the Sabbath day as their custom, reasoning from the Scriptures as follows: <br>  <br>  Acts 17:2 『As his custom was, Paul went into the synagogue, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures...』 <br>  <br>  Acts 20:6-7 『But we sailed from Philippi after the Feast of Unleavened Bread, and five days later joined the others at Troas, where we stayed seven days. On the first day of the week we came together to break bread...』 <br>  <br>  As it is written in the above verses, the apostles kept the Sabbath day. <br>  <br>  It is proven throughout the Scriptures that the Sabbath day?the seventh day, Saturday, Jesus' day?was kept until the apostolic age. So why do so many present-day Christians hold services on Sunday [the first day] and not on the Sabbath day? According to history, Sunday service originated from pagan sun-god worship. The Romans had been worshiping the sun god on the first day [Sunday], recognizing it as "the day of the sun," even before the birth of Jesus. <br>  <br>  <br>  The Sabbath Was Changed to Sunday<br>  After the apostles died, Christianity spread to western regions, including Rome. The gospel was preached to sun-god worshipers, and in the early 4th century, even the Roman emperor had heard the message of Christ. The emperor happened to be a leader of the sun-god worshipers, and when he converted to Christianity, many sun-god worshipers began to attend Church. As time passed, the faith of the Christians weakened, and they began to accept the customs of the sun-god worshipers. During this turn-over, they even began to rest and to worship on the first day of the week [Sunday]. In A.D. 321, Constantine, a Roman emperor, decreed an edict: <br>  <br>  "All judges, city-people and craftsmen shall rest on the venerable day of the Sun." <br>  <br>  Some argue that the abolishment of the Sabbath compelled many people to convert to Christianity, but we must not forget that altering God's commandments was Satan's sc|`|e9IDNlUoaa	Hi~ Omi~ Nice to meet you:)<br>  <br>  If I were to ask you what is the day we should worship God, you’d probably say one of two things; Sunday or any day. Hey, why not? I would like to propose a hypothetical question, if God said we should worship him on a Wednesday or Monday, what would you do? Of course we would go if God said. Then let’s confirm through the Bible the day of worship.<br>  <br>  Throughout this blog please keep this verse in mind-<br>  <br>  Revelations 22:18- "I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book. And if anyone takes words away from this book of prophecy, God will take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book."<br>  <br>  Now let’ see what God said in the beginning.<br>  <br>  Genesis 2:2- “By the seventh day God had finished the work he had been doing; so on the seventh day he rested from all his work. And God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it he rested from all the work of creating that he had done.”<br>  <br>  On the seventh day, God rested, blessed it and made it holy. God did this because he needs rest, blessings or holiness? Of course not! We are the ones who need all three of these so God made the seventh day for us to receive rest, blessings, and holiness. These things are very important for us and are necessary for us to receive salvation. They are so important that God put the seventh day in the Ten Commandments.<br>  <br>  Exodus 20:8- “Remember the Sabbath day by keeping it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your manservant or maidservant, nor your animals, nor the alien within your gates. For in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, but he rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.”<br>  <br>  In this verse which is the fourth commandment, God again mentions the seventh day of the week and also says that He rested, blessed it, and made it holy. However, in this verse God calls the seventh day the Sabbath.<br>  <br>  Everyone already knows how important the Ten Commandments are and accepts them as a part of basic Christian teachings. If you take a look at the other commandments, they all start with “You shall” but verse eight starts with “Remember”. Even though the Ten Commandments are very important God sets the fourth commandment apart by saying “remember”. God says to remember this day because He doesn’t want us to forget. Then we should see why God didn’t just say “you shall”, in order to do this we must see what day of the week is the Sabbath, the seventh day. Also by understanding what day is seventh day, we can receive rest, blessings, and holiness from God.<br>  <br>  Let’s check the dictionary.<br>  <br>  Sat·ur·day Pronunciation: \'sa-t?r-(?)dā, -dē\ Function: noun Etymology: Middle English saterday, from Old English s?ternd?g (akin to OldFrisian sāterdei), from Latin Saturnus Saturn + Old English d?g day Date: before 12th century<br>  : the seventh day of the week<br>  — Sat·ur·days \-dēz, -(?)dāz\ adverb<br>  <br>  1Sun·day Pronunciation: \'s?n-(?)dā, -dē\ Function: noun Etymology: Middle English, from Old English sunnand?g (akin to Old High German sunnūntag), from sunne sun + d?g day Date: before 12th century<br>  : the first day of the week.<br>  <br>  These definitions came from Merriam-Webster’s, you can check for yourself. The only problem is that man made the dictionary, of which there are many versions. This blog is not about the dictionary, but the Bible is the main concern here. Then let’s see according to the Bible what day of the week is the seventh day, Sabbath.<br>  <br>  If we think about one of the two most well known Christian holidays, Easter, we know that it is always celebrated on a Sunday. Easter is the celebration of the resurrection of Jesus, so we always celebrate Jesus’ resurrection on Sunday.<br>  <br>  Mark 16:9- “Jesus rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, out of whom he had driven seven demons.”<br>  <br>  This verse is about the Resurrection which we always celebrate on Sunday but this verse says Jesus rose on the first day of the week. We can clearly see that Sunday and the first day of the week are the same. Then if Sunday is the first day, then automatically we know Saturday must be the seventh day, Sabbath. Let’s confirm through one more verse.<br>  <br>  Mark 16:1- “When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go to anoint Jesus’ body. Very early on the first day of the week,”<br>  <br>  This verse confirms that the Sabbath and Sunday cannot be the same, even in the New Testament God’s Sabbath and Sunday are two different days. Then why do so many people keep Sunday worship?<br>  <br>  John 8:47- ”He Who belongs to God hears what God says. The reason you do not hear is that you do not belong to God.”<br>  <br>  Some people hear what God says so they belong to God, like those who understand that God’s day of worship is Saturday, Sabbath. Some people continue to keep Sunday because they do not belong to God. What about faith? Won’t we be saved because we believe in Jesus and have faith in him regardless of the day of worship?<br>  <br>  Matthew 7:21- “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. Many will say to me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?’ Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!’”<br>  <br>  Clearly this verse is describing people who believe in Jesus and have the faith to perform all kinds of miracles in his name. On judgment day, however, Jesus will tell them I never knew you, away from me you evildoers. Why? This is because despite their great faith in God, they didn’t do his will which we saw is Saturday, Sabbath. So no matter how much faith we have, we still have to be very careful in doing His will correctly.<br>  <br>  I want to give all thanks, honor and praise to our Heavenly Father Christ Ahnsahnghong and Heavenly Mother for restoring this truth to us. Thanks to Christ Ahnsahnghong, we are able to recognize God’s will for our salvation. Also because of Christ Ahnsahnghong, we are able to receive God’s rest, blessing, and holiness on the Sabbath day.|`|QJIXTpZ5aa	The sabbath is and always will be on Sundays.|`|1wNsBNmxaa	sabbath day has all ways been on sunday in everybody knows this if your friend was a christian he would all ready know that sabbath day is on sunday <br>  <br>  Saturday has never been on sunday<br>  <br>  Seth ????
