I have some new crocheted lace that I'd like to tea dye to make it appear older.  This process will work. However, during my research, I read that the tannic acid in the tea will cause the dyed item to deteriorate.  I was just wondering if white vinegar or some other substance would neautralize the acid from causing any damage.  I believe this question is for a chemistry or dye expert.  Are there any suggestions?  Thanks, B

20090227144111AAxd2UQ	Science & Mathematics;Physics	If time travel were possible, how could we tell which "time" we live in?	How could we tell whether we live in the past, present, or future? Also, if our present is another timeline's past and yet another's future, how can we tell if our timeline is the "mother timeline", the one from which all other timelines are derived? Where would all these timelines exist? And, how would people get from a future or past timeline to ours? Plus, if all timelines follow the same path through time, would the destruction of our civilization render all future timelines - where our civilization is still in existance - obsolete? What would happen to the people in those timelines? Would they just cease to exist? Worse, if a civilization in a past timeline was destroyed, would we cease to exist as well?      For this question I'm assuming that all timelines progress exactly the same way, with no historical differences, except that no two timelines are developing at the exact same point in time (for example, no two timelines are both on Tuesday, January 17, A.D. 1530 at 10:37 PM  with 53.6675 seconds at the same time)      Sorry, I know this question may not make much sense.

Franco anota en una hoja el resultado de multiplicar dos de los números, a su elección, y luego reemplaza el tercer número del pizarrón por ese tercer número menos 1. (Por ejemplo, si los tres números del pizarrón son 9,7,4, Franco puede anotar en la hoja 28 (=7.4) y en el pizarrón quedan 8,7,4). Con los nuevos tres números del pizarrón repite el procedimiento, y así una y otra vez hasta que uno de los tres números del pizarrón sea 0.

20070330061845AA4qf67	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Need a math genius for a word problem!?	read carefully...      Given a stack of thirteen cards numbered 13, 12, 11, ..., 1, we wish to reverse their order to give 1, 2, 3, ..., 13. To do this, we are allowed at any stage to make a move of the following type: Remove any section of adjacent cards from the pack and insert them elsewhere in the pack. For example, one initial move is to reposition 9, 8, 7 to give the ordering 13, 12, 11, 10, 6, 5, 9, 8, 7, 4, 3, 2, 1. What is the minimum number of moves required to reverse these 13 cards?             [Suggestion: You may choose one out of four suits from a full set of cards. Treat K as 13, Q as 12, J as 11, and A and 1. Pile these 13 cards facing up starting from K/13, Q/12, J/11, ..., A/1. Then experiment a little bit to try to come up with the answer.]

20080326013850AA6Okkb	Science & Mathematics;Physics	A question about light and color?	What color is light? I had heard that, "the color you see on an object is the only color that the object you see is not. It's all color but not the color is deflects, which is the color that we see." That being said, I thought about this some more. When you hold a diamond to light, you see a multitude of colors. Yet, the diamond is clear, (Seemingly?) colorless. So, is light actually dark? Because it is said that if you take all of the colors and mix them together, you make black. Any thoughts/ideas/opinions on this would be great.

20080331164855AAsXbXE	Science & Mathematics;Earth Sciences & Geology	Why does Earth have the strongest magnetic field among the terrestrial worlds?	Why does Earth have the strongest magnetic field among the terrestrial worlds?      It is the only one that has a metallic core.      It rotates much faster than any other terrestrial world.      It is the only one that has both a partially molten metallic core and reasonably rapid rotation.      It is the most volcanically active world.      It is by far the largest terrestrial world.

20081029200438AAGR8a5	Science & Mathematics;Physics	If all matter pulled into a black hole is ejected through the White-hole, does it change the matter?	I have ideas about the origin theory. I'm only a student so I would like some advice.       1) In astrophysics, a white hole is the theoretical time reversal of a black hole. While a black hole acts as a vacuum, sucking up any matter that crosses the event horizon, a white hole acts as a source that ejects matter from its event horizon.  Wiki.      2) A black hole's gravity pulls everything into it. Possably even Dark Matter.       3) some say at the center of every galaxy is a super-massive black hole- Astronomy lab at Uof Arkansas      4) Could it be possable that the universe is awith are witha super black holelackhole the size of a google plex in comparison to the one at center of our galaxy at one edge of the universe? It keeps pulling everything into it and then whenno longernolonger contain it "BIG BANG" out the white hole on the other side.?? Think of a snow globe with all the snow on the bottom. flip it over and gravity pulls it back down to the top. flip it again and gravity pulls it back down to the bottom. Is our universe one of many that is on a constant expansion-compression cycle? Damn this stuff makes my head hurt!         4) if all this is possable does the pressures in the black hole and sudden release of these pressures, leaving white hole, change the matter could this be dark matter?

Two point masses, m_1 and m_2, lie on the x-axis, with m_1 held in place at the origin and m_2 at position x and free to move. The gravitational potential energy of these masses is found to be U( x) = - G m_1 m_2 /x, where G is a constant (called the gravitational constant).      Find the x-component of the force acting on m_2 due to m_1.      Express your answer in terms of the variables m_1, m_2, x, and gravitational constant G.F(x)=      is this force attractive or repulsive and how do you know?

Last spring I found its kill (rabbit, vole) buried right next to the foundation of my home.   Now it's marking newly planted bushes which are only a few feet from my front steps. He's also left paw prints inside the bed of my truck, parked in my driveway.   I've never seen the coyote but I know they are established here.

20081029195534AAj8a1T	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	How is the big bang theory logical ?	I am not religious in any way. If you think about it, the big bang theory is a explosion. So since an explosion created something thats defying science, seeing as nothing is ever created from an explosion. Seeing as explosions do not create anything based on science, how are scientist so oblivious to the fact that the big bang theory was a lie. By this disproves evolution fully so think about it before you answer.      I want serious answers not answers that resort to any religious belief just pure science.

20081120201144AAYURtH	Science & Mathematics;Biology	Could the sensation of "free-will" be an evolutionary safeguard?	As humans we have the strong sensation that we are in control of our actions. In reality, there is no compelling evidence that we are in control of anything at all.      Here's my theory: As a species with relatively complex and abstract thinking abilities, the notion that we aren't in control of anything at all would be detrimental to our species (a species aware of its complete lack of control would be self-destructive or at least full of despair). As humans developed self-awareness and greater brain function, they also developed a stronger sense of being in control of their own minds and bodies and world around them. It's a sort of beautiful illusion to keep us happy and more importantly to keep us procreating.      I've also noticed when discussing free will I get a lot of "I make choices so that's proof I have free will you ***" kind of responses. I would submit this kind of upset reaction is also the result of our consciousness fighting back against the discovery that maybe we don't have any control after all.      I look forward to your thoughts on the subject and hopefully I made some sense…thanks for your time!

I'm wondering if they are not teaching it well enough in high school, or if people just block it out because it contradicts what they believe.   I see a lot of people here don't even understand what a theory is. They just think it's a word to describe a hypothetical idea.      What are the standards in America's schools? I'm very curious as to whether our educational system is failing or if the students are just too dense to get the concept.      And for you in Europe and other continents, same question. Do you guys have good standards when it comes to the teaching of the theory?
