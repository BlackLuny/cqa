ptQ5SkPVaa	I hope so, this would be great. It would be a nice change from the lame storylines the WWE has been using.    You have a point but I guess it's the best the creative team could come up with. I'm hoping Christian joins Jeff and Matt joins Edge. I think that would be a real twist.|`|gVlTlpb2aa	maybe undertaker vs kane|`|T13xM9iJaa	Well I think that it is some how going to be Matt vs Jeff vs Edge vs Christan in a TLC match for the WWE championship|`|Gr7My8FTaa	if they do wrestle each other matt hardy will win hands down
1X8c2hEFaa	First of all, Lebron is going to NY because its the big apple, Lebron will become for famous in NY. He will be a bigger player in NY.   Lebron and Bosh will go to NY.   Maybe Nash might go to NY for mid level contract since hes old.  Dwyane Wade might go to Piston or Dallas.  Amare will stay in Suns.  This Free agency is one of the best all time in nba.|`|LtOxnF0kaa	Lebron stays in Clevland (I know Surprise),Bosh goes to New York,Dwayne Wade stays in miami,and Dirk stays in Dallas.|`|vJyF8siJaa	Lebron and Bosh to NY make it happen!|`|97e9cd0596fdf596f0ec21521e6e36e5aa	well lets see,  i think lebron go's to NY  and Dirk leaves to go to another team|`|dsmKLAQWaa	Kobe and Pau resigns with the Lakers.|`|oRwnUAzlaa	nash will go to the knicks cause of d'antoni    i doubt lebron will go to the knicks, and bosh probably wont go anywhere cause he seems happy with the raptors...if anywhere i would say he would go to a team like the pacers or twolves, or bucks    dirk is loyal to the mavs  dwyane wade would go to a team similar to ones that i listed for bosh if any (a team that is around .500)|`|KdhNCnEjaa	LeBron James- Cleveland  Dwayne Wade- Miami  Chris Bosh- New Jersey  Paul Pierce- Boston  Michael Redd- New Orleans  Amare Stoudemire- Phoenix  Steve Nash- Oklahoma City  Tyson Chandler- Miami  Dirk Nowitzki- Dallas  Josh Howard- Denver  Ray Allen- Boston  Manu Ginobilli- San Antonio  Marcus Camby- Detroit  Jermaine O'Neal- His couch at home  Mike Miller- Charlotte  Rip Hamilton- New York  Stephen Jackson- Atlanta  Tracy McGrady- New Jersey  Joe Johnson- New York  Brad Miller- New York  Shaquille O'Neal- Charles Barkley's chair at TNT|`|Ga5QdZoXaa	LeBron James is going to the Chicago Bulls because he grew up as a Bulls fan and can really turn the team around|`|13XU8cCKaa	I think the Knicks will try to get Chris Bosh and Dwayne Wade.

While both of these have been good in the playoffs, the Steelers will not throw the ball to the other team five times, and they have one of the best run defenses in the league. This will allow Steelers to focus on the pass game. They have speedy corners, and Troy Polamalu is a monster. Their fantastic d-line and James Harrison should also get sevral sacks and knockdowns on Warner, which is never good when you have a 37 year old QB. 27- 17|`|bUy9yrtAaa	........|.....                ........|..........2 points ........|||"|""\__      ........|__________________|||_|___|)  ........!(@)'(@)""""**!(@)(@)****!(@)      CARDINALS!!!!!
nRBC4E5saa	He started off in Kyokushin karate, then moved on to Brazilian Jiujitsu, and since then has incorporated boxing, freestyle wrestling, and Muay Thai into his training.  Because he blends the various fighting elements together so well, you could say that his style is MMA.|`|hl9nqKQ2aa	I believe he started Kyokushin Karate as a youngster, although he employs far more styles now.  He is predominantly a striker but his wrestling is up there with the absolute best in the ufc, which is even stranger considerin he took up wrestling much later in his career.  He is well versed with submissions too|`|hVY2AWEbaa	hes a striker|`|r8CmwwNiaa	GSP ALL THE WAY!!!!WOOT!!    not sure though............

Yeah I agree the matches were okay, but the storylines throughout the evening kept me watching.|`|FGmEoXw9aa	More like Christian at No Way Out, why Wrestlemania, Sorry but to me he's like a mid-carder that has style, hey at least thats a compliment.

You never let your guard down during a fight.|`|Kh4p4gPXaa	Either rigged fight or cheap shot.    Touching gloves is a sign of respect,   to violate that tradition of respect... well... he might find it tough to find training partners,   and opponents would tear him apart.|`|3g2ng8Ksaa	I'm pretty sure the fight was rigged.  lol

QtjnmEzoaa	I'm pretty sure there's no truth to that rumor. People like to say bad things about him because he beat their team.|`|O2jH0yVFaa	gossip lol|`|eIOlBzm8aa	He is cheating on her with his playbook.
LUnscegvaa	Yes !!!    Bj  has a chance I'm rooting for him.    Best wishes :)***|`|hl9nqKQ2aa	Of course BJ has a chance, He is slick with his hands (perhaps even more than gsp) and he is without doubt better versed in submissions with his multiple Jiu Jitsu titles.  I think if the fight goes into the latter rounds, as always; BJ's lack of cardio will show thru and GSP will win, if the fight is concluded within the first couple of rounds I Cannot see GSP knockin BJ out therefore BJ winnin.  This fight i gonna be a lot closer than most people think!|`|MCB1ovEtaa	I think he will.  He's a beast.  He's a prodigy.  He's gonna make GSP "quit" again! haha|`|ca2S1dniaa	I hope cocky @ss loses. But sure he does have a shot or maybe a few shots to the face during this fight.|`|V5ZpqRs8aa	Im kind of in between. Because I know that GSP is a good fighter, but BJ isn't that bad either, and I know that BJ is really training hard so he doesn't lose this one.|`|f9soMMuiaa	Fun to read predictions after knowing the results.
hpYDczl0aa	Firstly, you are right, this is an epic 5 star WWE Match-up. I think this is how it would go:    A lock up.    K.F Naki with an armbar flip. Walker breaks a hold, but is locked in a crossface by K.F Naki. He breaks the hold again, but is thrown to the turnbuckle, whilst Naki attempts a clothesline, but it is dodged. Walker begins to attack Naki, and sends him to the mat. After some back and forth action, Braden Walker hits a Side Slam. He attempts a Spinebuster, but Kung Fu Naki reverses the finisher and hits a Crane Kick, before a pinfall victory.|`|az5NtgN6aa	KUNG FU FUNAKI|`|QouSk1E7aa	Braden Walker (but played by Charlie Haas), lol|`|zFB8PKjuaa	who the hells Braden Walker?|`|4tvI9WYjaa	kung fu naki but i think i be sleep before it even starts to be honest|`|SsodRf4kaa	It is not even a five star match!!!!!|`|a5X1sHHpaa	neither.    unless it's KUNG FU NAKI !|`|6ahTfnVuaa	Kung Fu Naki|`|26fb51ead612e7006829de7144c65343aa	everybody wants Kung-Fu-Naki|`|5JQFCQCkaa	If he was Kung Fu Naki, then him.
asYkSDdFaa	Can you really trust the instincts of a machine for something like that? In real life you have bonuses for winning, pressure from coaches,friends,family and team mates. Does the machine care who wins? No. Do they players and coaches care who wins? Yes. Think about it.|`|eIOlBzm8aa	Haha Rich you lost to the Lions? Madden simulations mean nothing.|`|Mf6cyniKaa	i think its wrong cuz steelers will win|`|xxtvhn5Naa	cardinals will win... just like madden said|`|kKxCevttaa	it is right on the money go cards|`|YCwmCDkUaa	So?    I played AZ with Pittsburgh and won 87-14...then I played the Lions and lost by 6    what does a video game prove?
0Dm3WEMcaa	Here in england we have something like that, they show the vintage collection with Mean Gene as weekly hour long show. I am a big fan of it because it gives me chance to see thing's i missed because i was either not born or still too young for anything like that, only person in my family that likes wrestling.    Taking a complete break would do damage to the ratings but if they started running something like the vintage collection on TV everywhere than it would give fans more opportunity to watch older wrestling and learn something.    In an Ideal world someone would start producing a wrestling channel and the WWE would sign up to let them show old wrestling along side current stuff and wrestling from all over the world. A one stop shop for all thing's wrestling would be best but i doubt it will ever happen.|`|7rpILeYtaa	in Australia we get WWE the vintage collection, on sundays after the smackdown replay.  it features matches from the 70's, 80's and early 90's. back when the matches were actually worth watching    its good, i like to tune into that each week.|`|09YK9Zboaa	That would be lame as hell no reason to do that|`|3I6YUfg0aa	People would stop watching wrestling and not be able to get back into it.|`|mJvZhdAuaa	NO, if you want to see the past, buy a DVD.  WWE has something special, they have 5 hours (soon to be 6) of fresh entertainment every week, plus PPV every 21-60 days; there is no off-season in WWE, so even after the cameras stop rolling, the wrestlers move on to another arena and wrestle another match.    Besides, they already have a similar situation, it's called WWE 24/7!|`|smcDn76jaa	I don't really know. The fact that WWE has no off season is one of the reasons I liked wrestling in the first place. It would allow me to see some of the old matches that people keep talking about. It would also be a chance for the wrestlers to take a break from the road and rest at home. To be honest I really don't know.|`|i1SQSUp1aa	maybe|`|H09OAJxSaa	no. they should make a cd for the 80s and 90s. they would lose rateings and wwe will be gone!|`|4c479c9c27bebd404d7ba657763fe54faa	They actually have a show in the UK called WWE Vintage Collection amongst the other shows WWE have. It's very good to see WWE showing the young fans old WWF matches. We get some matches from the 80's and 90's. Surprised US doesn't have the show|`|RiFtRVs8aa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. WWE IS THE ONLY REASON I HAVE A TV OR WATCH TV. But I watched the Hell In A Cell DVD and the old matches were awesome. I wouldn't mind that much if they showed matches like that or from late 1990s.|`|H7p09fL2aa	no  i would rather see a dvd or something like that from the attitude and golden era|`|zhXFtgPqaa	Heck no, that's what DVDs and all the stuff on wwe.com is for. Doing this would make them lose ratings and would be lame as ever. The NBA is going to take a break during their season to watch old games. And you want this for 1-2 months, oh heck no.|`|FGmEoXw9aa	Not really, watched too many of those moments, but if they were I would def. ask them to air the ECW/WCW Alliance vs. WWF storyline all over again, damn that was like Wrestling HEAVEN right there, before WWE turned kiddie like right now. But if they were to do what you said, they would lose ratings and wrestlers would be out of jobs to feed their families, and support loved ones, so dont be Selfish okkkkkkkkk, (lol) just kiddin but like I said...|`|Ez4svBtXaa	nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...|`|D8a0X3oAaa	No, the company would lose ratings and interest.
KdhNCnEjaa	Id say its a bad trade for NY because Lee is too good and has years left on his deal. But it would not go through because Miami wont pay Marburys salary|`|1ccf4408a6862b6272c7872e63b19c51aa	NO because the Knicks will get Better and the Heat get worse and bring D WADE down I don't like this trade.|`|GBGcI509aa	I dont like it that much.|`|to6ZRje5aa	not bad, heat could open up a salary cap space with marbury's expiring contract and could use David lee(resign d next year) in the post while Nate could back up Chalmers until Livingston heals. im not sure about d knicks|`|vuh0i3Axaa	ummm.ye...NO|`|yWzSiwFtaa	nope...too one sided...the knicks are losing two 15 ppg players and a great rebounder while the heat are losing a guy who can only shoot 3's, a guy who has the ugliest shot in NBA history, and two no name players in marcus banks and diwara...    too one-sided heat get the best of the trade

cOPCNP7Laa	Can happen. Hope it does haha|`|GjpWEu6Raa	CAN THIS PIRATE HAVE YOUR TAIL IF IT DOES...?    I NEED A NEW BROOM TO CLEAN THE SHIP|`|ymdelC6Yaa	I think you might be a little optimistic with that.  12 points.  Come on!  There are a few big games to play yet.  You're talking like you've already won it.|`|LauzNQDjaa	i will say that.. Chelsea will beat Liverpool this weekend. ( im a Chelsea Fan) Man uts already won so that puts them 5 poitns ahead.. .. i say its possible.. But Then chelsea will be a couple points ahead of Man UTD|`|mKazB56xaa	yes|`|LYY6Cfp1aa	thats alot
fqPb0m22aa	When you are looking at the judges NEVER look into their eyes... Always at there foreheads. And if it is an open tryout do not pay attention to the ppl in the stands. On your jumps make sure your toes are pointed and your feet land together. When doing cheer/chant/dance make sure your wrists are straight... That's an easy thing to forget. And of coarse never stop SMILING!! ;)|`|e43hjVI6aa	be as happy and as cheery as possible! make your moves super sharp and perfect. smile A LOT!|`|SRvOO3M6aa	Dont be embarassed, be CHEERFUL,happy, and always smile.  Try to be kind of hyper.
Y4mz8BShaa	The MAC 11 is not a secondary weapon, neither is the Desert Eagle. Both are quite large, and the Desert Eagle is just...stupid. Even in airsoft, you can barely hold it. You HAVE to sling your M4 carbine to be able to use it, which, in a tactical situation, isn't going to work out due to the large frame of the Desert Eagle. With a compact or single stack weapon, such an an M1911A1, you can draw the pistol while still keeping the sights of your rifle trained on the enemy, and then sling your rifle. In real steel, you if aren't prepared for the recoil, be ready to smack yourself in the face with your own firearm, or dislocate your shoulder, and even a small amount of debris contacting it can cause it to jam. The most useless modern firearm created.    The only drawback I see with the Mac 11 is its size. It would be a good primary, or another machine pistol to keep in say, an assault pack, but as far as keeping it at the ready, it's not going to happen.    You're much better off with a practical pistol, just as an 1911 variant or Glock product. They're actually useful.|`|AHaYaxnvaa	Desert Eagle i would say.|`|74Z162zmaa	well the specs are pretty similar but the desert eagle is by FAR the best looking pistol on the airsoft market (especially in black). i would go for the deagle based on that as the only thing seperating them is prefernce on looks and the desert eagle tops it there!

r5AMG8g7aa	you simply can't become effective with Dim Mak, Kyusho, etc from video. Don't waste your money. Besides unless your technique is flawless it would not do you any good anyway. Having been around this type of training for a long number of years I see this same type of question all the time. In over 41 years I have never met or heard of anyone that has successfully taught themselves by video in any style. Dim Mak is even harder to learn as it take a very long background of good martial arts or it is simply of no sue. most of the video available is not the real art anyway. People waste a lot of money on junk videos that promis to teach something that they do not deliver.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	You can not learn any martial art with books or off of the internet. You MUST have a teacher. Dim Mak isn't a mystical martial art that uses magic or anything. It attacks pressure points. Pressure point fighting isn't always effective. Pressure points do not work on everyone. They're good to know, but not to rely on.|`|v0FVM6vHaa	is this the dim mak known as the "death touch". if so you are only ready to learn after you can catch a fly with chopsticks, but you already knew that.|`|8Rep9De6aa	If you're referring to the "Death Touch," then I suggest you grow up because it doesn't exist.    The broader answer is that you can't learn karate from a book, so try to find a dojo.

Y4mz8BShaa	KWA has better quality internals than G&G. If you can afford it, and want to run a Li-Poly battery, go with the KWA. The G&G still tops everything on the market for under $300, aside from the KWA.    Aside from the Systema, I consider the KWA to be the best airsoft M4 carbine on the market. The ICS is nicer, but lack the stock capabilities of the KWA, and is considerably more.|`|Da3Rvlfoaa	KWA hands down.  -fast  -reliable  -powerful  -"purty"    BUT:  I hope that you find a field in which to use whichever one you buy.    "Street games?"    Playing in public can get you shot, arrested, or other such things.  People who play in public with their friends dishonor the sport; they give it a bad name.    PLEASE JUST GO TO A PLACE WHERE IT IS LEGAL!
juSjzf5oaa	i had that problem too , if he is not afraid form the water, pot floating on him and get with him to the pool and play with him, take some water toys with you that you know he will love to play with, preper him that he is not going tp learn just to have fun with you in the pool, show him the toys before or even take him with you to buy it, make sure he will know that with this special toys you need to play only in the pool. with little bit of hard work 'on him' it will work.  you can take with you 1 of his good friend too - friends know how to make friend existed sometimes try it.  good luck and i hope it's helps.

Some have had streams or rivers that you could fish in (Or swim in although they were quite cold).  You could climb rock and get a great view of the woods from above.  At night we would set up tents and have a small fire going.  We cooked food over the fire and told stories to each other.  We had a great time.  I live not too many miles from wooded areas.  They are great to drive through during fall to see the leafs change colors.    Woods are great.  Hope this helped you.|`|BnetTGCkaa	Peace.
65p86fMtaa	if your playing football on friday nights it looks dope, but when it rains you can't see, u have to be constantly wiping it,and if your playing on a field that has a lot of dirt the visor gets dutsy and cant see. but if you want it and got extra money for it get it.|`|xgqevAgIaa	If alot of teams' you know of supports these on the lines, go ahead and grab one.

2SSD6BP9aa	Jockstraps give better support then compression shorts or briefs.  Plus you have greater range of motion with them.  I prefer the swimmer/jogger style with the narrow waistband.    If anyone has a problem with a jock "rubbing them the raw" then they are wearing the wrong size strap.  All jocks are sized by the waistband.  You have to look at the box to see what waist measurements the different sizes fit.  They can be totally different from brand to brand.  There's no difference in the pouch size except between mens and boys sizes - and some brands have a teen size in between boys and men.    I guess it used to be that everyone wore jocks for any kind of exercise or sports, then compression shorts became big and no one was wearing jocks anymore.  But now people realize the jocks really are better and are switching back.  Compression shorts are over, and at my school they are even considered kind of a 'girlie' thing to wear.  But it may be different at your school or gym.|`|DcEBhY02aa	I reccomend compression shorts. Jock straps are ok but I am concerned about how it rubs on you. It rubbed my skin raw. Same as regular briefs the cotton rubbing against my skin is so uncomfortable. Plus sweating on them fadeing them out by constant wash. I love compression shorts I have total motion with them.|`|WrDGhduxaa	efficiency is not as important as comfort.  People run in all different types of shorts or not.  What feels best for you is what is best for you.
0Dm3WEMcaa	True, Jericho isn't lying when he sayes that. Fans complain about predictability but read spoilers. Complain about repeating story lines but the moment Christian's return is mentioned they want to see E&C vs. The hardy's in a TLC match again. Say John Cena's finisher is overrated and crap but will not hear a bad word spoken against the Rocks People's Elbow which no matter how you look at it is just an elbow drop.    Wrestling Fans Are nearly all hypocrites and i include myself in this i do it sometimes as well.|`|9Us6XYg8aa	every person alive is one.|`|NZKramllaa	Yes I agree with Jericho,we all are Hypocrites,even myself, this is a basic human trait, nobody is perfect, I see alot of Users put on here the Attitude Ara is overrated but they say they want Edge and Christian to reunite..again being a hypocrite is normal characteristic of all people, I'm pretty sure we said we don't want one thing to happen and then turn around and change our opinions and say that we do.|`|JiCfYfLraa	yes they are look at the way they did lita at first they liked her and as soon as she did something wrong(because she is human) they hated her and that turns my stomach. the wwe fans are nothing but two faced fake hypocites and phoneys. chris jericho says it all the time and he is right. first they liked him and then they hate him thats so fake because if im good or bad you should like me no matter. the wwe fans are disrespectful and hypocrites. it is true its damn true. they all piss me off im sorry about the hostility but i had to let that out. most of the wwe fans are little kids anyway and they know nothing about wrestleing i love jericho and lita they are the best.|`|SsodRf4kaa	NNNnnnnnnooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...|`|hpYDczl0aa	Definitely, wrestling fans are WAY too harsh on some superstars.    Fair enough if it's just heel heat and face pops.    But the way fans treat Cena is disgusting, he is a World Class Athlete and should be treated as the crown jewel of WWE. He gives everything to his fans, and they act so selfish.|`|2xSlS65iaa	No, I'm not one heck! I don't even know what that is|`|ZK3x8pbBaa	True.  One second they dont condone something.  Then when their fav wrestler does it, its alright.|`|QouSk1E7aa	First of all it's You're All Hypocrites, not Your All Hypocrites, secondly NO. WWE Marks maybe hypocrites, but WRESTLING FANS are not.|`|u2H68wiaaa	You know you blocked me, right?  What's up with that?      Most fans are hypocrites.|`|41WXZPnCaa	Yeah     When U STart 2 Watch Wrestling     U Say The WWE Is The Best     But Then U Meet More And U Like It More     And Many Guys Say    WWE Sucks   NJPW Rulz     But They Forgot With Was The First Promotion They Watch WWE|`|KXmMlqA9aa	Yes jericho is totally right! Remember what they did to Lita? One little mistake. She is still human and nobody is perfect! That made me sick the way they treated her. She is the best woman's wrestler of all time.That's one example. The next is John Cena! They all bag on him because he is SOOO boring! He isn't really. So he doesn't have many moves. There is always room for improvment! I am sick of all HYPOCTRIES! Sometimes I am one but I love LITA AND CENA! They both rock and I never judged Lita as a wrestler. Or cena.|`|rJMZdp04aa	Yes , Sadly it is True.    Most of the Fans have No Respect or Perspective beyond 2-3 Years of Watching WWE.    They Judge the Business without Any idea of the Tribulations it takes to actually make it Work & Run Properly.

a6EndAPiaa	The average nfl game lasts about 3 hours 12 minutes.  Contrary to popular belief the only difference in game length between the super bowl and any other NFL game is the length of halftime.  It is normally 12 minutes (or is it 13?).  For the super bowl halftime is 30 minutes.  The game should take about 3 hours 30 minutes.  Kickoff is scheduled for 6:28 PM Eastern.  Meaning that it should be over at roughly 10:00 PM Eastern.  This is of course assuming that the game does *not* go to overtime.    Post game activities usually go about 30 minutes.  Pre game activities start at 6:00 PM Eastern.  So the coverage of the game will go from 6:00 PM Eastern to 10:30 PM Eastern.|`|nr6KBe8Naa	6:28- 10:30|`|msTzcKl9aa	It starts at 6:30 and will end (guessing) 10:30.

ZMDECUhSaa	I'd like the Diva's championship to be there. All of the divas and soon to come divas because this game comes out when they are probably already here. I'd like to see deeper Roads to Wrestlemainas and more character choices. The "Create a Championship Belt" back because I had fun with that. When you go to "Create a Superstar/Diva" more name announce choices. Play as Hornswoggle (Even though he is a manager that would be a cool option.)

3iJ6CmAjaa	Ye of course it is. Anybody can join clubs at uni. You probably wouldn't be d only beginner either.
n2O0NwR6aa	Try this.  Put a panel mat down on the tumble track, and do your BHS there.  That will make it a little harder (like the floor), but you'll still be getting the spring from the tumble track.  Then add another panel mat, and another... making the surface more and more like a regular floor.  Once you're confident doing it like that, just move one of the panel mats down to the floor, and do your BHS on it.  Finally, step off the panel mat and do your BHS on the floor!  I've seen this work for a lot of girls!  Good luck!|`|po0b0L0Laa	My story is sort of sad, but yet happy at the same time...  I was in Cheer also, for about seven years actually, and then I had the same mental block as well. I never fell on my head, never did anything that caused me any pain, and yet I was still afraid to do them. I had to have someone just standing next to me with their arm out, they didn't even have to touch me, and I would do it. One day I just got really pissed and decided to do it, so I did. And then it came back for a while, but the fear never left and eventually that fear came out of hiding when I started to work on fulls. My mom ( I was pissed at her) told me that I was done, she said that if I didn't throw the backhandspring in about five minutes, then we were leaving the cheer gym and never coming back. So I went for it, but after the round-off, I paused, looked behind me, and decided that I just couldn't do it. That was my last day at the cheer gym. The 'good' side, ( I know I promised you the good side "D) was that because I was so bored durring the days I usually would have been at the cheer gym with my team, I tried out for soccer. What do you know, I found my natural talent! I also tried out for school's basketball, volleyball and tennis teams. I made them all, even varsity in tennis.   My advice is just get really mad, pretend that there's someone behind you that you hate and want to kick in the face, and do it.   I really hope you get it back if this is really the sport that you want to do! Good luck!    ( If all else fails, because cheer has kept you in such good shape, you will probably be a natural at any other sport you do!)   The main thing is that you have fun. If you're not having fun in cheer, then you shouldn't be doing it. Sports are made to be FUN! And cheer IS a sport.|`|jhFT5kT1aa	do it a couplke of times with your coach spotting you and tell them to just not spot you at any time(when your not expecting it) and then you feel the confidence rise and you will be able to do it no problem:)|`|V5ZpqRs8aa	Dude just go for it. Thats what I had to do. Just get some motivation. When I began practising them when I was in gymnastics. I couldn't do it without someone spotting me. But then my coach would just stand beside me she wouldn't put her hand near me.And I did them just fine. Just do it enven if you fail at least you can say you tried and then keep practising until you get it. Good luck.|`|sOkePjK3aa	I'm the same I can do one on a trampoline, but I get all weird and nervous whenever I try to do it on the floor. I don't know why but I always feel as if I'm gonna like run into something even if I'm in an empty room. Do you ever get that feeling?|`|5yTnGALCaa	First of all, it's okay to fall. I'm trying to learn a 1 1/2 punch half and  most of the time I end up face planting it. A BHS is really easy. Try to practice jumping back onto your bed a lot of times. Also on the trampoline do a BHS when you stand up quickly do a half turn and then BHS the other way. So it's like doing it many times in a row. Good Luck!|`|ep2soXmLaa	hey, i have had my backhandspring since i was 5, now i have my layout, backtuck, and fullout. im not going to lie i am a pretty good tumler, but all i have to say is dont do it on the trampoline it gets you all of balanced when your on the ground and make sure when doing your backhandspring to keep your elbows and arms straight!!:) goodluck|`|yz06jQrJaa	have a really, really strong coach spot u a little. u will trust him/her cuz they r strong but they really won't b spotting u. just, like a safety spot 4 confidence. when u realize u did it by urself a few times, u will most likely overcome ur fear of backhandsprings.
mJFgCvYlaa	Depends on the year model, check the Bikepedia website below for the MSRP when the bike came out. The oldest Tarmac is 2005.<br>  <br>  Typically, an average used bike would be half of the purchase price, but since you said its immaculate, probably a little higher. Most likely he got it for less than $2200, so make an offer of about $900-1000 if its really nice condition. <br>  <br>  Sweet bike by the way, hope it works out! Make sure its the right size for you.
FJFh0Fhsaa	It could be affecting your level of pop a little bit. It really depends on how much damage was done, like how big is the crack? If the wood is about to chip off the deck and splinter everywhere, you might have a problem. If its a tiny crack you're probably fine.    Whatever you do, try to think positive. I noticed that back when I skated if I thought I wasnt getting my ollie high enough, I would subconsciously start ollieing lower. It wasnt that I was purposely trying not to ollie as high, it was just my own negativity. It sounds cliche but if you tell yourself that you can still pop, then you probably still can.|`|54d31d8ca1d93393903fc5f7a7334431aa	Minor stress cracks won't affect your pops too much.    Major stress cracks will dissipate the energy needed to blast high ollies.    Leaving your skate out in the rain is a sure way to kill all pops.    You need a new deck.|`|KkboVhEiaa	...yeah, if you left your board out in the rain, Its trashed. the crack you getting is just the layers of vernier breaking as the wood gets more and more dry. i'd just go on ebay and buy a blank tgm board, it'll run you about 10-25 bucks and it will come with griptape.|`|2jnq70yMaa	no but you got a pressure crack one more of thoughs and your board is gone
7rpILeYtaa	i think that this could be a possibility. having a streak vs streak match would be good.  but a lot of people would rather see HBK vs Taker at WM.|`|7AvHjbTAaa	Koslovs isnt undefeated. Triple H beat him and Khali in a Elimination Chamber Qualifier on Smackdown.|`|AA12394248	first off yes kozlov has lost some matches but they dont count because they were not one on one matches so yes he still is undefeated in wwe.    now as for kozlov vs undertaker i agree. if taker is going to loss dont have it be against some one that is going to leave wwe in a few years like hbk. that would suck. have it be some one that is going to be around for awhile. that would help build a career for some one. not just add to one thats retiring with in a few years. so i agree with u 100%. have it be one of the young guys.|`|lWoxFHhFaa	It would only happen at Wrestlemania if Kozlov was the champion and Undertaker the No. 1 contender. Because for Kozlov to remain undefeated he will have to win the championship elimination chamber at No Way Out he will have to either win or lose. There is no way for them to skate by again he will either have to be champ or end this storyline. So I say its unlikely because Kozlov's not Champion material hes not charismatic enough and with Triple H Jeff Hardy and Edge it is unlikely that Undertaker would be the Number One Contender. Undertaker is more likely to face someone like Umaga.|`|KIOR56r6aa	My opinion ? Taker vs Kozlov at WM 25 will be :    1. The most predictable match in the history of Wrestlemania  2. The most boring match in the history of Wrestlemania  3. The fans will chant TNA  4. Many believes this will be a 5 stars match, yeah right, 5 stars out of possible 100 stars|`|nzKo4TFvaa	yea i am looking forward to umaga vs taker at wm25

ga4ZWsuZaa	Yes, in the new england vs. indy game in the playoffs, a offensive linemans scored off a fumble|`|NG6eeCfuaa	surfer, yes to answer your question, however, O Linemen are not the most agile of men. So when the ball is loose, O Linemen usually just try to immediately jump on the ball to retain possession. Very rarely would an O Lineman even think of trying to "scoop it up and run". A Manager/Coach would quite frown upon that.|`|gd91AkBkaa	Yes|`|B8sJEBxTaa	Yeah, it's just that most of the time they fall on the ball because it's pretty risky to try to pick it up and run when there are like 8 other people in that area.|`|U3ZR4aMcaa	Read number 4    Fumble    1. The distinction between a fumble and a muff should be kept in mind in considering rules about fumbles. A fumble is the loss of player possession of the ball. A muff is the touching of a loose ball by a player in an unsuccessful attempt to obtain possession.    2. A fumble may be advanced by any player on either team regardless of whether recovered before or after ball hits the ground.    3. A fumble that goes forward and out of bounds will return to the fumbling team at the spot of the fumble unless the ball goes out of bounds in the opponents end zone. In this case, it is a touchback.    4. On a play from scrimmage, if an offensive player fumbles anywhere on the field during fourth down, only the fumbling player is permitted to recover and/or advance the ball. If any player fumbles after the two-minute warning in a half, only the fumbling player is permitted to recover and/or advance the ball. If recovered by any other offensive player, the ball is dead at the spot of the fumble unless it is recovered behind the spot of the fumble. In that case, the ball is dead at the spot of recovery. Any defensive player may recover and/or advance any fumble at any time.    5. A muffed hand-to-hand snap from center is treated as a fumble.
4a635ec44438b74d7ce28e54d411c447aa	its called "Stickum." Maybe the spelling is wrong, but that's what its called. I'd check out sports stores, or anywhere you would buy a gymnastics leotard.

57f160948de75a1d7675018d99f4e4d1aa	Yes most definitely. There are 100s if not thousands on the web that make and sell far sexier and better styled suits than what you see in sport illustrated.    Consider that those suits shown in SI are not chosen because they are the best styling but because the manufacturers are will to pay $20,000 a full page in the hope of selling to you and others. This of coarse means that you may be paying a greater portion of the price to cover advertising costs.    Try for instance http://www.oceanswardrobe.com or you can try looking beyond third page on Google.     I might add that Google is not that good anymore as it targets your home country and bigger sites. To get good results you have to now type in the target country. i.e. swimsuit designers in South Africa.    Hope this helps

Who cares what a bunch of freezing morons with not enough sense to think of it themselves thinks.<br>  <br>  Actually, if you get flac from anyone using a camping site with electrical service, then that's pretty hypocritical anyway if you ask me. You're obviously not 'roughing it' so what's the point of criticizing someone wanting to be comfortable?|`|yQYP7yFuaa	if you do this i would set it on top of a piece of plywood covering the floor of the tent and have nothing around it that could possibly start a fire.|`|b8e17f565936253241a343443917ca6baa	If you don't leave it unattended and you don't leave it on while you are sleeping, then you should be o.k.  The plywood idea is a good one (or invert a milk crate and set it up on that).|`|PCngc7Araa	just get a better sleeping bag. I have one rated to 0 degrees that i got for 30 bucks and its keeps me toasty. ( a little to toasty actually. i have to leave it open along the sides so that i dont sweat). A portable heater is not the safest idea|`|QbcP5SA7aa	Heaters are intrinsicallyy dangerous... get a really good blanket or sleeping bag and use those chemical warmers for your feet (it's usually the worst) or better... wait to camp on milder weather|`|ZB3cWcVXaa	My advice is to bring some thicker clothes, and don't forget some gloves and a hat.  You might want to also consider getting a warmer sleeping bag if you just have an average one.  You'd be amazed how well some of them work.<br>  <br>  And if you really want an external source of heat, you can buy a bunch of hand and foot warmers.  They look like big versions of those "do not eat" packets, but you shake them up and they get plenty warm enough to do the job without burning you.<br>  <br>  It's worth not risking a fire.  But if you REALLY want that heater, you'll probably be fine just turning it on for short bursts.  Just make sure you put in on the stool.|`|llcbe14kaa	If you have or know anyone who has, an edenpure heater, that might be the ticket, They do not get hot externally but do put out a significant amount of heat, I use one in my travel trailer and I hardly ever have to run the propane furnace. Beware, they are pricey!|`|O3Yx21WMaa	You sound like a sensable person to me, go to Wall Mart get the smallest, least expensive electric heater you can find and remember to pick up a cheap extention cord - be careful with the heater and stay warm.|`|HkMhWvtgaa	I know this doesn't directly answer your question, but a few months ago, I picked up a great tip from this forum:  If you feel cold, make sure you're not dehydrated!  The tip said that even drinking cold water before you get into your sleeping bag can keep you warmer.  I found that hard to believe, so I tried it at  home.  (I turn my thermostat down fairly low, not like winter camping, but low enough to feel pretty chilled by bedtime.)  I tried drinking a glass of ice water in the evening when my fingers and toes were already cold, and sure enough, I was soon warm and comfy.  <br>  <br>  The point isn't necessarily to drink ice water.  It's that your body needs water to keep warm, and it's easier to forget about hydration in cold weather.  Drinking plenty of water may keep you more comfortable in those lower temps, even without a heater.  It's certainly a lot less risky.
8T0Z0Y17aa	I cannot believe you even mentioned the current Indian team and the great Aussie and WI teams in the same question. That Indian team is far from being worthy of that.<br>  <br>  Their inconsistancy away from home would be the first thing I would use as evidence of them being overrated - that is why those Aussies and WI teams were as good as they were - they could beat you in practically any conditions.|`|cdfab17577ad8962b270c540b0b46e98aa	Agreed that we are a little bit weak when it comes to standard of great teams of the past but why do you have to look at the past?Past is past and present is present and presently our team is among the best teams in the world.If we are overrated we wouldn't have been still in the Top 3 rankings of the world in both formats.<br>  <br>  I guess some people hated to see their opinions regarding Bradman or Sobers.But this is cricket section,you have to live with it.|`|f46e40cfc0dd6c8bb80ff83f005fc521aa	Can you tell me who said so.<br>  Even if somebody had said so,Why you did not counter him then and there instead of spreading it here.So why can't i say it is all your making.<br>  To answer you, the present Indian team shows signs of becoming the best Indian team ever.But it can be confirmed only when they when they actually show the result.|`|af5d52fd49c3606b73f3d910229c8a9daa	It's some of their delusional fans who keep on talking them up, espically some of the Nancy boys who post here.<br>  The rest of the cricketing world know exactly where they are at.

At the moment, it is the team to beat. Presently, neither Aussies nor West Indies are near their standard! <br>  <br>  But i will 've to agree Steve Waugh and Clive Lloyd had great teams under them.|`|XVYRUzkEaa	No, I don't feel that the Indian Team is overrated. They are playing superbly presently. They are even in the Top 3 Rankings in World.

So wake up to know that Australia is not as might and strong as they used to be, like the Steve Waugh era or  like a few years ago. Proof :---  historic defeat to the South Africans and then a near loss to the Kiwis, so now  my Q to you, is the Aussie team too overrated, compared to the team a few years ago???<br>  Ans_ Yes,,,, Live with it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|eHcXI4jFaa	This Indian team is not a great team.  But they may prove to be in time.  Winning the NZ series in NZ and then later beating South Africa in SA woiuld go some way towards this.  Until this happens this cannot be claimed as a great team.

a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	There are a lot of factors that are involved, and it depends on the players as well.    Let's take a look at Alexandre Daigle.  At the time he joined the league, he was joining a team which was poorly run, had very few veteran leaders, and both the coach and GM were not of the highest quality.  As a result, Daigle was playing on a team where there were no players with his raw skill, and no leadership to help refine his skills and aid in his maturation.  Patrick Stefan was also a victim of this in Atlanta.    Let's take a look at Mario Lemieux.  Mario Lemieux joined a team which many believed was better than their record indicated.  As Mario points out, the team had an experienced coach in Bob Berry, a GM with Stanley Cup rings (Ed Johnston), and 3 former 50 goal scorers (Hehoe, Babych, and Bullard).  After training camp, Mario says he knew he was among the right people to refine his game.  As it was, like Daigle, he was now the face of his team, but unlike Daigle,  he had the right people around him.    As I stated yesterday, we don't know how good Datsyuk could have been as a rookie.  He was playing on a team that won the Stanley Cup, had a hall of Famer for a coach, and a plethora of Hall of Famers in the line-up.  he had a lot of people to learn from, but he had a lot of people to wait behind too.    There are exceptions to the rule.  Dale Hawerchuk for example.  Here's a player than joined a really bad team (the Winnipeg Jets) and went on to have (at the time) the 2nd best rookie season ever (he's still 4th) without the benefit of anybody else providing high quality leadership.  He ended up having a career that has him among the top 10 in points/game in NHL history so no ill effects were had.    It is a huge jump from juniors/college to the NHL, and not all players can make the jump.|`|Uathep5Yaa	Professionalism|`|5376e6bbdda4627888c1a35a0f74e222aa	they need to know that they must try try try again.encouragement.
bB5d5YVeaa	Absolutely not.  You have no right to wear anything but white.  When you are a black belt, then you have the right to wear black or other colors.  Until you reach that rank, you should be dressed in white.    This reminds me of a a time when I went to test for a belt.  The academy that I was involved in had many locations.  They all came together for the testing every 4 months.  One student was out on the floor practicing in his black uniform (I think he was a brown belt).  The Master politely went to him, tapped him on the shoulder and with a big smile said...."And do you plan on testing today too?"  The young man nodded his head and said yes.  The Master then said, again, with a polite smile, "Not in that outfit you're not."  The fellow changed into his white uniform before the testing began and everyone lived happily ever after.|`|Kh4p4gPXaa	I agree,  the first two posters need to get the hint that because they see it on UFC it doesn't make it better than any other.    As far as rather you can wear them,   they aren't reserved,  but your club likely has a policy set out about what you can wear.    Speak to your sensai,   that's the best way.|`|3DnX9NmAaa	Black pants aren't officially reserved for any certain belt rank. I suggest you ask your teacher before doing it.    Don't listen to the first two answers. They do not know what they're talking about. No martial art is better than another and Tae Kwon Do is very similar to Muay Thai depending on the school it's taught in. Just two more ignorant M"MA" fans.|`|r5AMG8g7aa	Contrary to what some have said the issue of uniform colors that are allowed may be a very big deal. It depends on your instructor. In some style you can wear just about anything. In more traditional styles it is insulting to wear anything other than what the normal uniform is. Many styles do not allow black pants below black belt. As I sad it varies from style to style and school to school.   Ask your instructor before wearing them to class. You just may be saving yourself an embarrassing situation.    EDIT:   I see we have the official Thumbs down present here. I see no reason why anyone would be giving a thumbs down to several of these answers.  While some are given from a lack of experience or personal likes or dislikes, several answers are truthful and come from much experience.|`|dc6f042f0a1f241b0647713f95aefc3aaa	Ask your instructor. Why in the world would you ask on YA? All you will get is stupid biased opinions from many a young idiot that claims to have knowledge but in reality watches to many stupid martial arts movies like the first answerer on here.    By tradition students under the rank of green belt in most TKD schools are required to wear full white...but it is up to your instructor so go ask them.|`|fRosDAZEaa	I think you will get laughed at, don't stand out by making fashion statements.|`|V5ZpqRs8aa	I don't know much on taekwondo..but i agree with the first person.

r5AMG8g7aa	Rules to follow:<br>  <br>  1) Just hang up. The caller will get bored if they can't get you to react. Sooner of later they will stop calling.<br>  <br>  2) NEVER, EVER yell or threaten them. It just feeds their need to keep calling. <br>  <br>  3) Do not stay on the line with them. That is what they want, hang up.<br>  <br>  4) NEVER get angry or slam the phone down. Again that will just encourage them to keep calling.<br>  <br>  5) Notify the Police and Phone company.<br>  <br>  6) Use call block to block the caller number if you have that option.<br>  <br>  7) Change you phone number if possible.

Stay away from areas you know are trouble and when alone keep your cell phone handy and be aware of your surroundings.

Often the call is enough to scare away an attacker.<br>  <br>  If you feel you need physical self defense skills look up schools in your area that offer these lessons. You will have to put some time and effort into them if you ever want to use them in the wild and answers you get online today won't necessarily help you tonight let alone weeks/months/years from now.

q8dX0MsNaa	l have never had a problem with either BPS or cabela's rods. they both have quality rods well within your budget.<br>  as far as a long casting reel (spinning), take a look at the U.S. Reel which bass pro shop carries. it has an oversize spool which will handle even heavier lines. line on the larger diameter spool will have less spool memory and as you cast, the depth of the line remaining on the spool doesn't decrease as much causing less spool lip friction thus allowing longer casts. <br>  rods/reels will handle fluoro/nylon equally. just make sure your knots will work with fluorocarbon and hold their strength. that has been my biggest complaint with fluoro. strong knots.|`|AS5bLez1aa	Your rod will not always help you cast really far it takes a well balanced outfit from the rod the reel the line and the lure.If I were wanting the whole package that is what I would go for.Bass Pro shop have got combos that sell for a $100.00.There spring sale is going on right now KVD combos are a good choice you usually get a descent rod and reel.|`|c81fa0395c7807a69ecfa0cdd3674cb1aa	these are my suggestions<br>  rod: <a href="http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product_10151_-1_10001_104147_100002002_100000000_100002000_100-2-2?ordProd=Y&CMID=TOP_selectitems#itemDetail" rel="nofollow">http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores...</a><br>  <br>   reel:<a href="http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product_10151_-1_10001_102801_100001002_100000000_100001000_100-1-2?ordProd=Y&CMID=TOP_selectitems#itemDetail" rel="nofollow">http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores...</a><br>  <br>  line:<a href="http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/Product_10151_-1_10001_10201400_100017002_100000000_100017000_100-17-2" rel="nofollow">http://www.basspro.com/webapp/wcs/stores...</a>|`|bkhvdfJxaa	<a href="http://www.cabelas.com/prod-1/0032016120027a.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.cabelas.com/prod-1/0032016120...</a><br>  <br>  go with the 9ft|`|9TlKNVhcaa	I would go with the one that has Dora The Explora on it.|`|n9IZ8xPRaa	any rod 6'6 in the prince range Between 70-100 dollars will be a Quality rod Personal i would go with a daiwa! but you can never go wrong with an ugly stick|`|e489c62788059e4428b1a976b978488faa	Bass Pro Shops have some really good rods for under $100...that is about all I use...I have no complaints...now Cabela's on the other hand...I bought a type of rod from them that broke a total of three times while setting the hook or swinging a 3lb fish in the boat...the M6 Series sucks...

OK, i understand he wants to have some influence, but rather than trying to break the world record in the amount of a single transfer fee, he should invest in youth academy and in some younger potential.|`|HraimwiDaa	I'm sort of a Man City fan... more of a Robinho fan.

Hughes is doing a good job, he needs time to build a team - The players he started with weren't Hughes players - Elano and the crew aren't exactly the type who will stand up and be counted. I'm really impressed with Stevie Ireland, as well as all Hughes' signings. We should be a great team in 5 years, but we all need to be pretty patient. I don't see why people are getting so worked up, we've been waiting 30odd years for something, another 5 won't do much harm! Hopefully we can push on for the UEFA places, and get to the semis of the UEFA Cup. Looking forward to tonight, we've gotta beat them!<br>  <br>  CTID!|`|QuGTZJIVaa	Well, we've got rid of SOME of the dead weight.  I like the look of De Jong, Kompany, Bellamy and Given.<br>  <br>  Robinho and Elano need to learn that the Premier League is a tough SOB league to play in and their moody sulks aren't wanted nor appreciated.  Hughes is the right manager to take us forward, but not to the League title.  <br>  <br>  We should be targeting a top 8 finish THIS season, not anything else.  A good run in the UEFA Cup would be nice, but for now we need to start playing like a unit and SORT OUT OUR BL**DY AWAY FORM PRONTO!|`|Oc1o5Ndyaa	Theyree okay I (L)L) CELTICC!!|`|1545062c5c87be5a56f1f287fcc4e2c2aa	I h8 man city!

Then do your roundoff and push off with ur hands more.|`|fqPb0m22aa	When you are upsidedown in a handstand in the middle of the round off... Kinda bend your arms a lil and push off more and snap your feet to the ground. It should be very quick.  If anything make your arms stronger and you will have no problem. :)|`|yz06jQrJaa	more momentum. run more than a few steps (but try not 2 lose speed) and then do ur round off. also, exagerating ur movements or doing ur round off in slow mo. w/ someone spotting u helps a ton.|`|DGDhQBwpaa	squeeze your butt.

The guy is so huge and has so much potential but is still a -13 or something on the season so far. You never know when he's going to work hard or just float around the ice all game. Its not someone Burke is going to want to base his team around for the future.|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	Toskala and Stempniak both deserve better than to be stuck where they are.<br>  <br>  Stempniak should be sent to Calgary for Bertuzzi, and Toskala should be sent to Buffalo for Jhonas Enroth.|`|9GzkVwfGaa	Mayers|`|0f213e569404219f01d20decc3749462aa	Kabarle, for free to the Flyers. Thanks.|`|Pc0QjrQ4aa	They shouldn't get rid of anyone.<br>  <br>  However, they should contemplate making deals that help the franchise.  <br>  <br>  You're looking for prospects, draft picks, youth, and ability.  Anyone that doesn't have a NMC/NTC that they won't waive and whose last name isn't Schenn or Pogge...folks, it's yours if the price is right!<br>  <br>  I like Moore...he's a tough scrappy kid with some skill.  I like Jeremy Williams.  Toskala isn't bad either.<br>  <br>  With that being said, if someone offers up a screaming deal, toodleoo!<br>  <br>  Put it this way- if Holmgren takes one to the head and turns into a vegetable-head, and goes nutso and offers up Jeff Carter and a #1 for Kaberle (as was rumoured last year); see ya Tommy.  I'd drive Kaberle down myself.  <br>  <br>  If Washington offers up a prospect or two for Toskala so they can win now...I'd paint his mask red for him.<br>  <br>  If San Jose decides that the big #80 is their missing ingredient (with that, to what- I'd say another 2nd round exit) and they offer up a #1 draft pick...I think Burke's taking that deal.<br>  <br>  If the Wild need scoring and want native son Blake, and Blake agrees to waive his JFJ I'm-a-rube clause...bon voyage.  <br>  <br>  So GM's...phone lines are open...no offer too big!
4c479c9c27bebd404d7ba657763fe54faa	Take pictures, don't bring a camcorder, security will take it from you, I expect they'll do a bag check before you go into the stadium, bring some money for food and drink if you want to and be careful and have the time of your life at WM25!<br>  <br>  You don't need to bring a chair but you could take a chair, not sure if you could do that but give it go!

If they're having the fan event you guys should go to that. You get to meet the wrestlers and get their autographs.

You may want to bring a camera because WWE events are often a big deal especially Wrestle Mania 25. Rather than having sporting event chairs (like at hockey/baseball/football games etc..) you will get a padded steel chair with wrestlemania 25 on it and probably some pictures of the wrestlers. You do not need to buy it, it comes with the price of admission. On the floor you're not standing, you do get to sit in the chair they provide (the padded one).  Have fun!!!|`|An10In6daa	You can bring a camera to take pics,but no video recording,If you want to you can bring some earplugs because the pyrotechnics can be very loud and If you have ringside tickets you can carry home your commemorative WrestleMania Ringside Chair.|`|olZS5xQdaa	You need to bring a sign that says if Cena wins we riot.
cg5kVPnIaa	Yeah, that would work, especially because they're both good passers for Bosh, and Harris is just plain sweet.  Also they would make great kick-out passes to the Raptors' great 3-point shooting and shoot well themselves.|`|21J0IIZbaa	The Nets are not going to trade Harris.  It would be great for the Raptors to get a point guard like Harris.  Iverson makes a lot of money so the Raptors would have to give up 3-4 players.|`|GswnLKtQaa	If you can trade calderon then the best option is devin harris but the nets won't trade him. so calderon will stay.|`|0f213e569404219f01d20decc3749462aa	Neither team would trade Calderon or Harris for an aging AI.

The Next MJ...|`|21J0IIZbaa	I would give ROY to Rose.<br>  It will be close between Rose and Mayo|`|vFbzBo4eaa	It's between Rose and Mayo.I hope Rose wins it.Other people that can get involved are:Westbrook,Oden(Because of his team records and if he continues to get double-doubles he will be great)Gordon and Lopez|`|G0qBlKI1aa	you people saying Beasley are out of your minds....Beasley doesn't even start, and his minutes have been cut.  It is defenitely between Rose and OJ.  I bet (and hope) it goes to Rose....he plays more of an intregal part in his teams offense, he not only scores as many points as Mayo does, but he is in charge of distributing the ball and getting everyone else invovled.|`|fuYYRJXtaa	The race is tight right now.  Rose & Mayo haven't shined for a while.. Other rookies such as Eric Gordon, Brook Lopez and Russell Westbrook are making a name for themselves.|`|vzH7f7V5aa	JJ Hickson.|`|0ytjj1EGaa	Between Mayo and Rose|`|lgB7SD46aa	Kobe cause he plays like one|`|kjJkQpzPaa	I think either beasly or rose.|`|2AQZtdyiaa	I agree with you. I think OJ Mayo is the best rookie this year|`|9UhoUcM2aa	=( can you please pay NO attention to the troll up there pretending to be me...<br>  <br>  <br>  I think its going to be Rose =)|`|F05yVezraa	Beasley all day|`|WLXFAeSnaa	Derek Rose, or OJ Mayo|`|C4mzZwiWaa	beasley or rose|`|mZGBlGSRaa	Derrick Rose will win rookie of the year over O.J. Mayo. Mayo averages a few points more but Rose leads in assists by plenty. They both can't play defense yet but Rose will win it because he's a closer on his team and he isn't even the best shooter for the bulls. MICHEAL BEASLEY(yeah right)!|`|8bk0KM0oaa	OJ Mayo is a shooter, nothing more. He can't play defense and just jacks off shots. However, I think Derrick Rose or Westbrook is going to get it. Both can distribute, but Rose is more of a potent scorer.|`|AA10495187	Beasley.|`|2H3CeuNkaa	I think and hope that D- Rose gets it.|`|KZuNW3iFaa	Derrick Rose is insane!!!|`|Oz7x0faxaa	D-Rose|`|41f8c91e37ce92508470d2b23aef415baa	probably rose, although I want Westbrook to win|`|MVDMEBsIaa	Beasley ? you guys are crazy...mayo or rose

IITnJjAjaa	The UK standard for senior men is 23 seconds but anywhere from 26 under is great!|`|abnqs0jQaa	Ok, first answer was completely ridiculous... 19-20 as a good time?!?!<br>  That is pretty much world class, running around 20 flat.<br>  <br>  As a distance guy (primarily 3200 myself) I found something in the realm of very high 24 - low 26 was decent for someone who has a severe lack of fast twitch muscle fibers, ie: myself. However, a good time for a designated sprinter in high school would be somewhere in high 22-low 23 range I think. It's been 6 years since I was in high school, but I would guess that a time in the lower end of that range would hold up pretty well in a dual meet, perhaps not an invitational though. My estimates may be a little low, tough to remember, sorry.|`|Bkm8o7staa	a good state time would be a 19 or 20. if you have run distance then you have the endurance. all you need is the speed and quick muscle reaction. <br>  practice running <br>  10-100's <br>  10-200's <br>  4-400's <br>  <br>  not all of them have to be all your speed. <br>  part for endurance and part for speed.<br>  hope this helps.|`|b0SMjRvlaa	I won our state meet my senior year with a 22.3. If you run under 21, you're world-class, and if you run under 22, you're instant D-1 NCAA material.<br>  <br>  Anything under 24 outdoor is pretty good, and around 25 is average for high school.|`|PEvoumoZaa	as a senior distance runner you should be able to run high 23 or even a low 24. i am a sprinter only a sophomore and i run 23.5 definitely not 19-20.
hTGu2ujeaa	Sorry I've written a lot...<br>  <br>  Work on your cardio fitness. Swimming is an awesome exercise as it works arms and legs, do it continuously and then try and build on it each time you go (maybe twice a week?). <br>  <br>  The obvious answer for cross country is to practice running, aim to do that three times a week so that your muscles can relax  and recuperate between runs. While you're running, if you jog for 2 minutes, sprint for 20 seconds (play with those numbers) and repeat then you're working on your fast twitch muscle fibres as well as the slow twitch. <br>  <br>  Have a couple of rest days other wise you'll do damage to your muscle.<br>  <br>  Skipping is one of the best workouts (I think in america you call it jump rope?) ace for cardio and works on your legs and arms. It tires you out pretty quick but do what you can and then try to build on it.<br>  <br>  Flexibility is something to work on, just do stretches when you wake up or something and then try to move more each day.<br>  <br>  Balance is something to work on, specially in football. Stand on one leg and have someone nudge you from side to side, gradually getting harder. repeat for other leg.<br>  <br>  Agility, set up a course with zigzagging cones, run from one to the other and back to the start - try to improve time. Have a straight line of cones. run to the first and back to the start, second and back to the start etc. again improve time. <br>  <br>  Strength building exercises.<br>  <br>  Circuit training= Jump rope, push-ups, sit-ups, agility training, jog on the spot, holding weights in both hands and box.   You decide on timing.<br>  <br>  And of course the obligatory eat healthy.|`|G6iWLx6Vaa	you made it to state with an 18 minute 5k.. wow... I didn't even go to state running a 16:15
bO0moNVfaa	320 lbs?is that with fat?try to get the fat off, and ur in shape. it doesnt matter what you like, or ur rep, etc. if you train hard and properly you will kick ***. If you dont hit hard, you hit a heavybag until you do. If you're slow, you train faster. If you have no stamina, u run, etc. If you have a boxing lesson, make sure u have a real trainer thats your personal trainer. so that hes not just teaching you a jab, but he actually gets you in boxin shape long before you fight.<br>  <br>  Mike Tyson was running, doing pushups, dips, situps, and jumping rope long before he boxed.train your body to box, dont just go in there out of shape and hit a bag<br>  <br>  <br>  for style you can either dodge punches and come in and hit back, or since ur so tall, you must have long reach, and you could defeat people with your long jab, but that takes..no skill, and its the only reason people like klitschko are pro..|`|U91xlYS8aa	prtty big for 320<br>  anywas i suggest mma<br>  mixture of mui thai kickboxing and grappling<br>  its like ufc

LnJjS8BRaa	Most of the movement in Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do philosophy comes from fencing so you'd surprised at how much that training can carry over to weaponless matches.<br>  <br>  That said, your friend sounds like he has much more hands on experience and training when it comes to empty hand fighting.  You'll have a difficult time of this without any training of your own and three months likely won't bridge the gap in your experience levels.<br>  <br>  This being a friendly match I'm sure you'll both be holding back and pulling your punches and kicks. In these situations I usually see a lot of shooting for takedowns because it lets you do something decisive yet relatively harmless to your opponent. Work on your sprawling to stop take downs. When fencing focus on how you stay outside the reach of your opponent and consider how that can be applied in a weaponless fight. <br>  <br>  Once again, friendly matches can turn very unfriendly very fast so I don't suggest it. If you want to get some martial arts training then by all means sign up for martial arts. You can even sign up with your buddy (your message was a little unclear but I think it was him who has martial arts experience) and get plenty of opportunity to spar with him as you learn.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|apPTFtHdaa	I'm confused by your statement that you've never practiced martial arts, and yet you state that you are good at martial arts. If you don't have any training, then probably the best thing you can do is continue to work out (e.g. build strength and endurance). However, losing 20 lbs/month is actually pretty hard on your body. 2 lbs/week is the "ideal" rate of weight loss. <br>  <br>  Also, you should now that sparring doesn't establish who is necessarily "better". Fighting is probabilistic, not deterministic. In other words, training, endurance, strength, etc. can increase the probability of winning, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the better fighter wins. I've seen lots of fighters who were supposedly "better" get taken out by a single knee, kick, punch etc. that just happened to land at the right place at the right time. Even in non-fighting sports like football, basketball, etc. the best teams don't always go undefeated. Even the Patriots with an undefeated season couldn't win the Super Bowl. Does that mean that the Giants were better, or just happened to outperform them on that day?

1ced09090a18210ce355123ea9003d99aa	I saw Fritz many times in the 60's and 70's, all of his sons in the 80's, and Kerry in the early 90's.  I've always been a huge Von Erich fan (especially Kevin).  Kevin is number one on my list of greatest wrestlers to never be a World Champion.    The Von Erich family is legendary in the wrestling business and I, too, hope the entire family gets inducted into the WWE Hall Of Fame.  But not this year.  This year, Stone Cold Steve Austin gets inducted and everybody else who gets inducted with him will be far overshadowed by him.  I'd rather they wait until there isn't a giant in the business (like Austin) being inducted.|`|AA11482019	The Modern Day Warrior Kerry Von Erich is a wrestling legend.and should be in the Hall of Fame.|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	I grew up watching Kerry Von Erich, along with David, Kevin, and Mike. They had some wars with the Freebirds in WCCW. I always rooted for the Birds.|`|OGPW7xZ2aa	who
NZKramllaa	Yes, That's the same thing I have been saying, Cena would be Champ regardless of what time or event he came into WWE.    BQ1: I think his rapper gimmick would have fitted in the Attitude Ara, Cena had alot more spunk and attitude When he had the rapper gimmick and Rap was getting really popular around the Attitude Ara, so he probably would have been a huger hit back then, his Marine gimmick would have suited right after the Attitude ara around 03 the first Tribute to the Troops broadcast.    BQ2: Some would argue its the FU but I don't think its as overrated to the degree of the Peoples Elbow...Its basically a regular elbow drop with a modified name...and has lesser of a impact than the FU.|`|f9hiPMDxaa	No, back in the "Golden Era" Hogan would have beaten him. I wouldn't have liked Cena's chances against Macho Man, Ricky Steamboat, Andre. In the "Attitude Era", he wouldn't rate against Stone Cold, when he was fit. I wouldn't like his chances either against the Rock. Now both Stone Cold and the Rock are out of it. Stone Cold because of injuries and the Rock because of his acting.|`|ePvvGUu3aa	WQ - I absolutely agree with you. Whether anyone likes him or not, he is a big draw as you mentioned. John Cena even takes time off him to promote the company, etc. He would be champion in any era because he is one of the biggest draws in history and has the appearance they need also.     BQ - The rap gimmick would fit best with Attitude Era because it was the perfect time to make the best of all his disses towards other people or companies. He wouldn't really have a limit to stop him from what to say really. The Marine gimmick would best suit the era now and the era before the Attitude era. Basically can suit any era, but in the Attitude era it would be 50/50.    BQ2 - I would hate to say, but The People's Elbow. This is just an elbow drop with a few dramatic seconds added to it. The impact of the move just couldn't cut it and when people would lose to that move, it was more of a "eh" reaction from us.|`|qATNZh8xaa	I'm a big C-Man fan!|`|kST3xlDnaa	I'm probably 1 of the biggest john cena fans ever.  agree.  BQ1:yes maybe  BQ2:Prolly the peoples elbows.|`|W0rRfLU0aa	no. people wouldve hated him in the time before the attitude erra when it was stereotyped that only black people could say what he says.   cenas rap gimmick wouldve been good from late attitude till now  the elbow. so damned overrated...|`|oAjbBLDpaa	I think Cena is very marketable and could probably have won it in any era IF the WWE had chosen the right gimmick for that time his current gimmick isn't really something that today's society would like to see whereas it would be OK in late 80's early 90's  in how I see it. He is great for the company regardless. He promotes it in every way he can and that's what draws my respect to him.   BQ: The Marine gimmick is something that would fit in the late  80's or early 90's, the rap gimmick is something that fits in late 90's early 00's.    BQ2: The People's Elbow is more overrated. At least the FU is a display of strength, the People's Elbow is a guy bouncing off the ropes followed by falling on his elbow. Not very special.|`|zr3UiONJaa	cena woulda been dessert in the golden era n attitude era..dude...|`|rJMZdp04aa	Yes , Cena could've Dominated any Era.  Possibly give Hogan & Austin a run for their Money , Respectively.    Why? - Exactly what you stated.  He makes $$$.  He sells.      BQ1 - Rap = The one he used it in. Rap was Popular.  Marine = Attitude Era or Again , the one he used it in.    BQ2 - The People's Elbow by FAR.  It's just an elbow drop with Theatrics.    People far underestimate how Incredibly Difficult it is to pick up someone who weighs 500+lbs. on your shoulders , Hold them there , and THEN FLIP them over your Head.  That takes TREMENDOUS Leg Strength.|`|AA11482019	I disagree.  Cena sucks..  BQ1: none.  Cena sucks.  BQ2: FU.  Cena sucks.|`|9Us6XYg8aa	yes  1-attitude  2-FU        Also the throughback is so retarded.  FU will always be the FU.

This year there really isn't too much of that.|`|UQLNP6iyaa	Maybe they are just a little classier than your average Eagles, Cowboys, Patriots or Chargers fans.    NOT!     I think the Steeler fans are a little nervous that their offense might have to score more points than they are used to to keep up with the Cards high powered O and reasonably competent (in the post season) D.     I think the Pheonix fans are still a little surprised to find out they have a team in that town.

L8R|`|U7oDXHglaa	I wouldn't say that te steelers fans are quiet... they talk almost as much crap as dallas or the eagles|`|PSMsDalLaa	What I can't understand is how Eagle fans are so pissed off on how Arizona shouldn't be there. First off they were blowing out your team, then you came back. Then the record comes into play. I know Arizona was 9-7, but its not like the eagles were 12-4, they were 9-6-1, and had an act of God to get them into the playoffs.
ztH0zAIFaa	with a backhandspring you are alredy at an advantage for a h.s. team! to be more flexible you should do your basic streaches twice a day.. when you wake up and when you go to sleep.. something that has helped me fit in streaching is just doing it during the day when im watching tv. to gain the height its all in your ABS so you should do sit ups. once you have stronger abs you will be able to pull youself up higher n your jumps! good luck at tryouts! remember to SMILE and be PERKY!! lmao|`|yz06jQrJaa	get a private coach 2 help u, u will get basically all ur skills in like 2 hrs, no joke

The Raiders beat the Vikings and I was with some guys from work at one of their homes. Number one of all time for me.   Number two has also been endearing to me, the 1977 N.C.A.A. men's basketball championship game. Coach Al McGuire and his team of somewhat underrated Marquette Warriors beat coach Dean Smith and the N.C. Tarheel's. I broke my wrist at work and got home just in time for the tipoff. I was alway's a big fan of coach.
7rpILeYtaa	at the moment Christopher Daniels is playing the role of Suicide while Kaz recovers from his ankle injury, so my guess would be after Kaz's ankle is better and he can go back to being Suicide, then and only then will Christopher Daniels will make his return|`|vTalY5Skaa	Suicide(Kaz) is out with a injury and currently Daniels wrestles as suicide.

And when kaz recovers he'll be back in the suit. But they should have chosen someone bigger to replace kaz. There is a large size difference between daniels and kaz, so the should've chosen someone larger, like eric young

qD3r5sfCaa	Shaolin Kung Fu is not about fighting: the monks use martial arts as a method of meditation and spiritual development. Buddhist monks do not practice for martial (war) activity; rather they practice for self perfection.    For the most part, true Chinese Martial Arts are dead. There are very few practicioners in this world that can truly apply their techniques. The Shaolin temple was burned to the ground in the 60's by Mao Zedong and the Communist Party of China in an effort to revolutionize the nation. After a legion of martial arts masters were killed and information lost, Chinese martial arts became weakened into performance arts...Wushu.    The Temple has been rebuilt, but is a tourist attraction populated by authentic Chan sect Buddhist monks. I'm not saying they're fake in their belief, however many of them simply learn performance Wushu. They are in exceptional physical shape, but that doesn't equal fighting skill.    UFC fighters are top athletes who spar all the time. This gives them a huge advantage in or out of the ring, even if you claim that it's just sport fighting.    I do not believe the average Shaolin monk would be able to defeat the average UFC fighter. HOWEVER, if the UFC fighter happened to be fighting one of the few authentic Shaolin Monks who are able to fully apply their skills, then the UFC fighter wouldn't stand a chance.|`|KeAJzw36aa	well there is a place in china were they get boys when they're young to train them into shaolin monks and they're all training to go on the road to show off their skills for performance, but the thing is shaolin monks aren't allowed to actually use their skills for violence so if they did do ufc that would be breaking some code. If you wanna know were i got all this info there's a documentary on shaolin monks and explains all the stuff i said in more detail and more.|`|hl9nqKQ2aa	Im sorry to sound grouchy but these kind of questions are really boring and i see about 5million of them on the net.  The way I see it if the 'mystical' arts of kung fu are so good then why are there no pure practioners of it in any of the fight organisations? ufc, dream, pride(rip)etc etc etc.  Cause I believe its hyped up movie nonsense.  The shows and demonstrations the monks and other kung fu artists are v. impressive but i believe absolutely useless when you have Brock Lesnars Iron sized hands comin at your face or CroCop aiming a kick at your head!|`|LFWQiGYkaa	MMA is a sport just like any other sport.    It is not, as advertised, the ultimate test of martial arts. The reason styles end up all resembling each other in the UFC is not because they're coming up with the "ultimate" style (that's just the publicity). The reason is the sport is set up to favor certain approaches more than others.    In order to compete and be successful in this setting, a Shaolin would have to undo years and years of some of the hardest training done on earth and learn something completely new. Not likely to happen.    Apples and oranges.|`|4Src7JvBaa	because other than flashy showy garbage shaolin monks only other proficient techniques are eye gouges, groin shots, and of course HAAAAAAAA    DUKEN!|`|HDbMh2YBaa	That would be interesting wouldnt it? I'd pay to see a 180 pound kung fu expert go against a 250 pound jijitsu expert. It would be sweet. Those guys can break bricks and also train their bodies on how to take impact. It would be interesting for sure.|`|nRBC4E5saa	The current "Shaolin monks" are not actually monks at all.  They are essentially acrobats, used by the Chinese government to attract tourists.  Between the Manchu invasion, the Boxer rebellion, WWII, and the "Cultural Revolution", most of Chinese martial arts culture was destroyed.    There was an article in Black Belt magazine a few years ago detailing a training experience with said "monks".  The man said that while they could do incredible physical feats, such as holding a horse stance for hours or doing finger-tip hand stands, they were easy to defeat in sparring.  According to the article, they had nothing close to a fight strategy, were easy to out-box, and had no grappling to speak of.  Considering that he actually spent time training with them, I believe it, especially in light of what I've seen of their demos.    So, what if they entered the UFC?  They'd get smashed.  They don't actually train to fight.  They train to do aerial cartwheels and look pretty doing forms.  Now if you could take someone with that kind of conditioning and body control and train them for two or three years in real fighting, there would be a lot of potential for success.

hL3eS2zKaa	I personally like:  WWE Championship better it is more prestigious and it has a simpler design yet sleek design.    I like the Intercontinental Championship because it is it a worldwide championship, not just for one country. I dont really care for either of its' designs.    I like the WWE Tag Team title better because it is more reconized and they should be like combined. The design on these two makes no difference.    I like the WWE Womans Championship more because its more prestigious and more reconized. I DO like the Divas' Titles' design better. Pink for girls, but I am a girl and I do like blue better.|`|9Us6XYg8aa	1-wwe  2-wh  3-ic/us/womens  4-wwe tag/world tag  5-ecw  6-divas    WHC looks the best.|`|XdQYUC2paa	WWE but without the spinner thing bring back the old title also it has more history    Intercontinental much better champions have held this title it is a stepping stone to the WWE title    World Tag Team titles now a days the WWE tag titles have bad champions well now a days the Tag teams division have no good tag teams apart from Miz and morrison    WWE Womans more history Trish, lits, mae, Victoria ect|`|i8W0e6P9aa	divas champ!!!!|`|zjUV5QjKaa	WWE Championship: invovles good storylines  Intercontinental Championship: Shelton Benjamin's reign is too long  World Tag Tem Championship: Miz and Morrison are awesome!!

Intercontinental Championship because it has a modern verse like WWE championship but it also has been in the hands of many of the great superstars who have and haven't made it to be champion.     WWE Tag Team championship    Women's Championship holds more respect because it has actually been competed for by the most prestigious women wrestlers ever to come in plus the Diva's title is ugly.|`|NVecufXJaa	WWE Championship  Intercontinental Championship  WWE Tag Team Championship  Diva's Championship|`|2FKHNIB2aa	Respect: WWE championship (it was the first)  Look: WWE championship (hiper more new look)    Respect: Intercontinental (some of the greatest champs have held it)  Look: U.S championship (I love the look of it its just good)    Respect: Both (im a huge tag team fan and i cant choose between them)  Look: World Tag Team Championships     Respect: Women's (first and last)  Look: Women's (divas looks like a dollar store toy)|`|bGAv6Gjpaa	The NWA belt! the US belt World Tag team belt Womens Belt!|`|JiCfYfLraa	the womans champion since im a woman and i will be womans champion someday you better watch look out melina.  wwe championship  intercontinetal champion  wwe tag team champions|`|9x1w6Tg0aa	tna whc    x division title    tna world tag team title    knock out title

QmEcrv95aa	it depends on how much the person is spotting you.   if they are giving you a heavy spot then dont a tempt it, but if they are giving you a light spot then try it. just remember to jump back cause sometimes when doing a backhandspring on a trampoline by yourself for the first time you totally forget about jumping back and you jump up and its not a fun landing. also if you dont feel comfortable doing it by yourself yet ask the person who is spotting you to to just be there for you but you do the backhandspring by yourself but the person is still there for you if you need help.   hope this helped [:|`|Yh5gooL7aa	well if the spotter doesnt have to help you much then go for it  and do it yourself    but if you want do it a few times with the spotter than by yourself|`|fCKFqXN8aa	have the spotter keeping spotting you less and less until their hand is barely touching and eventually they will take their hand away and you can do it by yourself

First, he plays behind two other young centers on a young team.  The Grizz just spent a first round pick on younger Gasol and he is proving to be legit.  They also have Darko who is the highest payed player on the team so they have to give him minutes if they ever want to trade him or even keep him.      The other issue is that he did look good in the Olympics, but he was often at a huge advantage against his competition in the Iranian bracket.  He is slow, especially for the guys the Grizz put on the floor.  I think he could contribute in the league, but he needs a half court team so that his speed isn't as much of an issue.|`|EKF2HdZKaa	well the grizzlies didnt even think he was a good player,so they sent him to the d-league when he didnt play a single minute  i actually think he can benefit a young team,one which is into half court offense|`|lmOSLN5Uaa	he's good|`|8s9q4V03aa	lol, "the Irianian"|`|zjUV5QjKaa	WHO?!!!|`|MTId7EKtaa	i didn't even know he exists...

zDYEKx67aa	That last drive... Absolutely breathtaking seeing Eli get out of the sack and then make the catch to Tyree... amazing...absolutely beautiful|`|VBeFzAV1aa	none.. both teams are sh*t. the pats run up the score and are losers. karmas why they didnt make it to the playoffs. eli is a spoiled little jerk. he crys to his dad and has no talent. im happy the pats lost but i didnt really care. the chargers imo are the most deserving team to go to the superbowl but have had bad luck with injuries the last couple years.|`|ga4ZWsuZaa	NONE, and i look forward to the cards shocking the world|`|FmZyN6ORaa	That last drive...eli nearly gets sacked while throwing the ball and tyree's incredible catch on 3 and 5...that saved the game for us  of course plaxico's td is a close second  I still remember it like it were yesterday (:  tomorrow I'm pulling for the underdogs..Cardinals 31-27|`|rNUyV1EYaa	As a Cowboys fan, I did not enjoy last year's Super Bowl.    I know it was an awesome game. But if you were a Dallas fan, you would understand watching the Giants win it all was not a good feeling.    Tomorrow night should be fun. I am hoping the Cardinals win; because almost nobody thought they would get this far.|`|H1VIZsutaa	Haha f**k Dallas!|`|DvKpx0Reaa	haha im a pats fan, so i'd have to say when new england FINALLY scored a touchdown. but, i have to give it to the giants' last scoring drive. biggest upset ever.|`|cgm3WNlOaa	the best moment was when the clock hit zero and the giants won and im looking or the same ting this year with arizona winning|`|7obFZ2Gyaa	My favorite moment of Super Bowl XLII was when Plaxico Burress caught the winning touchdown. I am from NY and  even though I picked Patriots to win  I was esctatic when the Giants won and stunned the whole football world.  It couldn't have been better than that. David Tyrees catch on 4 th down was second favorite.    I hope to see the Steelers beat the  Cardinals with their defense ad running  game.   Santonio Holmes is an excellent return man and is a big time wr.  It's gonna be a good game  in my opinion.     Go Steelers !!

U3ZR4aMcaa	It's the thrill of competition and strategy. It's about watching 11 guys who are the best at what they do, depending on each other for a common goal. Only a select few have their abilities and they will only have them for 8-10 years at best. And the brutality of the game is second to none.     It would be like watching two of the best chess players go at it in a park in NYC, or a group of guys or gals designing a super modern house HGTV. The fact that they are sweating means they are actually working extremely hard for a living.     Some people like TV marathons and over consumption. Everyone is different.      YS, why do you got make it about being gay? You like football, so like it. How does gay even come into the picture? It's guys like you that are making the world so ignorant. The guy asked a legit question.|`|WtcTBlccaa	i love Competition|`|XrCc85kNaa	What do you like watching??  Do you like watching the Jonas Brothers??  Damn....stay in the gay, lesbian section!!!|`|DvKpx0Reaa	i can't speak for anyone else but me, but these are the main reason i love watching sports:  1. father-daughter bonding time. my parents are divorced so i don't really see my dad and when i do i don't know what to do/say. we both love football so it's a win-win.  2. i suck at sports and its fun seeing professionals go at each other  3. american tradition  4. escape from reality!|`|rNUyV1EYaa	If you don't understand the game, try not to insult those that do. I don't care much for hockey, but I don't feel the need to go to that section and post questions like this.    I have interest in the GAME. If you want to focus on the sweaty guys, then that's your privilege.|`|QtjnmEzoaa	1. Watching your team win  2. Watching the underdog win when your team is out  3. Watching people mature as athletes  4. The hype before a big game  5. The excitement when a truly skilled, intelligent athlete is on the field/court/diamond  6. As a girl, watching guys jaws drop when I enter in a football conversation and actually know what I'm talking about. (so much fun)  I could honestly go on and on. There are so many reasons to love it. I think it starts, though, with a love for a team and its players.|`|Uh7HagITaa	why do you watch TV shows, its a bunch of guys and girls you dont know "pretending" to be mad, sad, happy. and you care what happens in the FAKE show.    at least sports are real.|`|CRpV54jXaa	It is about more than just the game...  its about socialization  and when they all bet who is gonna win  they get all excited and pumped to beat  their friends with bets....  Guys are really competetive like that!|`|NYg0M9Ttaa	I love to watch any sport. I also love to play any sport. Except golf. It's not about a bunch of sweaty guys. It's about a team coming together from wherever they started, who didn't know anything about each other, putting all they have into one game or one season to succeed in a common goal. It's fun to be competitive with whoever you're watching it with. Pick a team and root for them the whole way.|`|Z03zgM0maa	Same reason why you would watch any other TV show. It gives people something to do. Plus sports are real and you get to make bets and predictions, then feel good about yourself if you're right. It is fun to be cheering for a team with your family and friends or having cookouts and such. Going to LIVE sports events are also really exciting and great. There is also a lot of lessons to be learned about sports teams, such as loyalty, hard work, passion, and good sportsmanship on and off the field. I don't think it should ruin your day if your team loses, but it certainly is great to be a sports fan. You feel part of something rather than part of nothing.|`|T6nmD3X9aa	To some people it's loyalty. Like people who watch soap operas. You follow along your favorite teams (or shows) and you begin to get into it. I love football, hockey, and sometimes baseball. I never miss a Sunday if I don't have to. Being that you are not a football fan, you might not understand this...I am in Michigan so I LOVE the detroit sports (Lions, Red Wings, Pistons, Tigers, UofM sports). I watch them and cheer them on even through the really bad years (Lions...cough, cough), but never the less, I watch, I cheer, I get ticked and swear at the TV. Its the drama, the suspense, the pride, and the glory. You get to know the players and the strengths and weaknesses....you get to learn the management and the game plans. Example: Kurt Warner (quarterback for Arizona, playing tomorrow)- he started out bagging groceries at a supermarket. Wanted to play football even though he was a little older to be starting in the game. He got into arena football and got scouted from there! Its a great story!!! You get attached to the competition of it all. After a while, it becomes part of you in a way.     Being a woman, I have many friends that really could care less about most sports, but the love my enthusiasm, laugh at my irrate screaming during stupid plays, and cheer with me even though they have no idea what they are cheering for LOL    Its fun! If you follow it long enough, you could feel the same (If you wanted to!)

2r65qaMgaa	no they don't do that... teams are usually "invited" into the tourny.|`|8s9q4V03aa	nah|`|lmOSLN5Uaa	nope|`|X5Yp72Mjaa	The conference championships are usually a week before selection sunday(when the final 65 teams are selected). All the teams in the conference are put into a small tournament with rankings of how a team did in conference games. Whoever wins gets an automatic bid to the NCAA, but it doesnt mean that the team that wins gets the highest seed in the tournament. the final selections are based on a teams whole season. But the point is if a team has a terrible season, but wins the tournament they automatically get to go.|`|b40414584ffd6fcad32915fbaebb4120aa	no not usually but if a team wins the league it could help their seed in the tournment. It is usually for the teams that isn't that good to run the table and make it in.
a6EndAPiaa	The home team gets to choose which jerseys they will wear.  The away team has to wear the opposite.    The home team switches from conference to conference every year.    Think about the Redskins, Cowboys, and Dolphins who all typically wear white at home.  The home team chooses and the away team wears the opposite.|`|rNUyV1EYaa	The NFC and AFC alternate being the "home" team.

2uaG87rFaa	Peyton Manning is a former Super Bowl MVP, and so is his brother Eli Manning. They led their teams to the Playoffs this year, which gives them a shot of a Manning vs. Manning Super Bowl in the future. Some people, including me would like to see one. Here is what I think:    Super Bowl XLIV  NY Giants  -27   Indianapolis-21    Obvioulsy, the MVP will be Eli Manning. Go Giants forever!!!|`|U7oDXHglaa	yea next year is my prediction|`|QtjnmEzoaa	Both of the Mannings are professionals. They've played each other before and it hasn't to my knowledge caused any strife. Do you honestly think Eli would give Peyton the silent treatment or something if the Colts beat the Giants? They know how to win, and they know how to lose. It's a game, and they recognize that family is more important.    I personally don't think it's all that attractive of a matchup. You'd see a lot of Brandon Jacobs running all over the place and a lot of Eli Manning interceptions. Both teams are good where the other is weak, and that leads to a game full of mistakes, turnovers, and poor tackling.    I don't think it's going to happen. I think Peyton may have one more SB left in him, and the Giants may be able to carry Eli to another Superbowl, but I think the odds are too long for it to happen in the same year. Never say never, though.|`|rNUyV1EYaa	Well, the Colts and Giants have already played (not in the Super Bowl, obviously) and it didn't create any resentment in the family. I guess in that case there would be no clear winner or loser as far as family is concerned.    Do I think a Manning Super Bowl will happen? No, but that doesn't mean it won't. I like Peyton, but to me Eli is incredibly overrated.    Or maybe that's the Cowboys fan in me talking...|`|DvKpx0Reaa	NO!!!!|`|KZsdVGJzaa	it would be interesting but it will never happen the colts will never make it back to the superbowl for a long long time|`|Kh4p4gPXaa	I hope so.

oJ6sq5KEaa	Well, in my opinion, I think it depends on how much you wanna spend for the whole set up (Gun, Hopper, Tank, Mask, Etc.) and as for the FPS, it is always adjustable on about 99.9 % of guns. Our local field is indoor and it only allows 220 FPS. Any ways here it just my OPINION and what I personally recommend for a beginner:      Gun: Smart Parts Vibe ($149.99) | Hopper: Evolution 3 Hopper ($59.95) | Tank: Pure Energy 48/3000 ($54.95) HPA (High Pressure Air) tank.    Total: $264.89                                                        OR    If you are on a really tight budget and don't have a lot of money:    Gun: Kingman 2007 Spyder Sonix ($64.95) | Hopper: Viewloader Revolution V-Force ($34.99) | Tank: Standard 20 oz Co2 ($14.99) Tank.  Total: $114.93    As for the mask, it's really up to you, any mask that helps reduce fog should be descent.    Oh, and one more thing, If you want to know the difference between HPA and C02 then go to the source below:            http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=alc0650GY...    Now please remember that this is ONLY MY OPINION on these setups so please don't flame. Thanks.|`|jkjVPrqxaa	Well all paintball guns are supposed to shoot about the same (300 fps), it is extremely dangerous to be shooting anything over this. What is your price range? there are hundreds if not thousands of paintball guns out there, ranging in price from $20-$2000 dollars. But i think you are probably new to paintball, so i would recommend the smart parts vibe. It is easy to maintain, easy to use, and is the best gun in the $100-$200 price range, coming in at about $150.

Slugs will go through at close range. Don't use them for self defense.   Buckshot will likely NOT penetrate through the body. Go with 00 buckshot.    A 12 gauge shotgun with 00 Buckshot is widely considered to be the most deadly and effective self defense weapon.

Sure they might use all the hot water, but any bugs or dirt in the shower will wash away when they are in it.|`|9FjkYgQgaa	if you dont want to kill them get a cup and a piece of paper and slide them into the cup and then take them outside and let them go    if you are like me and a absolutely terrified of bugs and just want to get rid of them, throw stuff at them till they move or pour water on them and make them go down the drain and then keep your eyes open the whole time you shower to make sure no more get in

VghVdPfsaa	Well, I would suggest using a treadmill or stationary bike at the gym if you can.     If not, try doing sprints up and down your stairs (make sure to stretch before doing anything though). Do some lunges and squats to help strengthen your leg muscles. If you can, get someone to use a jump rope to try and hold you back as you try to run around the house if you have enough room.|`|khLIL1vsaa	well use a treadmill then at a gym or something at least 20 minutes and at least every 3 days, but prepared to run alot especially if you are in distance. its best to be in shape and eating healthy beforehand too    and good luck with track dude

WrDGhduxaa	He should have been in the Hall while he was alive. The purists who refuse to vote for a track star, even though he changed the way defenses played the game should get over their prejudices and do what is right.  Many lesser people are already in the Hall.|`|0xm2Dd1gaa	Yes, he changed the way not only defenses, but offenses approached the game, its not enough to play man anymore, the zone was designed to stop him, and WRs need to be fast, as well as have hands, and the shut-down corner is all because of him...so yes, its long overdue,but he's in, and the past is the past.
MTId7EKtaa	that's boss|`|csKyqot0aa	They don't go over 99.|`|jajmF5Uvaa	Just imagine, 2000 players and 1 ball.|`|asYkSDdFaa	There has yet to be a sport to allow 100+ players on a team in one season.|`|2r65qaMgaa	yeah they dont go over two digits|`|0ZyB6T9Zaa	for at least basketball  when refs call fouls  they need a number they can show with their hands and say  and they only have two hands,with five fingers on each hand      thats what i was told by my coach cause i was wondering also.|`|MqwQBeJHaa	there is no need, there is no sport or team with more than 99 players|`|X5Yp72Mjaa	The biggest roster allowed in sports is football which is like 63 so there is no reason to have triple digit numbers.|`|uXTVxaJ8aa	because no one actully pick 3 nubers
uFqkgwhQaa	GO KNICKS!|`|3teWTOPqaa	lol YS, lookout Danny Granger is going to dunk on............. umm.... Danny Granger!    lol, yeah the Knicks will be a good warmup game for the Lakers to get ready for the Celtics and Cleveland.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	They are playing well.|`|EKF2HdZKaa	hopefully they will be able to pull an upset in boston and in LA  good luck to ur knicks  actually u do know that they are beating a team which beat both boston and la  ..they better watch out|`|V03f8tmMaa	OMG im throwing a party who cares|`|JSryPP8faa	Unfortunately no. We're coming back to the otherside slowly but surely. Believe  what I say.|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	Great warmup up for a great upset.|`|nynlxGmNaa	if you like offense knicks is the team to watch|`|YeNp4m8haa	Cool  i think he ment blowing out indiana in indiana|`|N3AiQRJFaa	yea i like this blowout, since Knicks are my fourth favorite team. But guess what Lakers and my first favorite team and expect another blowout but this time it won't be the Knicks. I hope Knicks destroy Celtics though.|`|GBGcI509aa	Haha MC.|`|eF60R7DPaa	YEAH!!!!!
5vAh6U6Caa	it's never good when any player from any team gets injured. as fans we shouldn't rejoice when someone's in pain just because we hate the team he plays for.|`|13XU8cCKaa	I don't like the Lakers but I do like Bynum and he was really becoming a very good player.  It is very unfortunate.|`|AA10744471	While I am not a fan of big Andrew Bynum, I would not wish him to suffer an injury. That would be counter-productive for the NBA. I desire for no injuries for all players, even for my favorite pet peeve, Ron Artest.|`|3teWTOPqaa	Last time Andrew also hurt his keen against Memphis. I am more concerned about Bynum than haters, they laugh cuz they are afraid of Lakers team with Bynum.    Dude I am in as much shock as Kobe is right now, when that injury happened I just went blank for like 10 minutes and then I realized the game was still on.    EDIT: god I am ******* pissed right now! He was playing so well lately!    EDIT: lol Sasha looked like he was crying. Cheese is scared cuz he saw what Bynum did to his team on Christmas, if the Lakers win the championship this year then all the Celtics fans have start convincing people they were Lakers fans all along.|`|sOae9LUzaa	I have to admit, he was playing great basketball before the injury. However, it shouldn't be used as an excuse for losing last year's finals, that Bynum was out. Lakers fans shouldn't use this excuse either if the Celtics win in Feb 5th. SO as much of a right as it can be used as an excuse, so will teh haters keep on rejoicing.    I'm just saying that IF the Celtics win, or any team int he next couple of games that wins as a matter of fact.    Edit: MC, I doubt you will really stick with Lakers once they lose everything and are reduced to a team like OKC.|`|2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	Which knee did he hurt last time?    left or right?    EDIT: I think it was left, so its a good thing he didn't hurt that one again.
Cb5N6UaQaa	What's up with the Karma Bandwagoners now?  I guess now if anything happens from now on to Bynum is karma?  Or is it that everybody in the NBA has never given a hard foul or done anything bad?  If that were the case some people would have been punished a long time ago.   Or maybe Karma is another Lakers hater, like many.|`|4DcvpQXfaa	yes he will be OK    but yeah KARMA for him!|`|GBGcI509aa	Yeah its karma sorry.|`|7t7XzXsVaa	He should be fine|`|ZkJ3CvXpaa	i hope he is yes it does AUGH!!!!!!!!!!!! poor ANDREW AUGH stupid cr@p|`|2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	yes|`|P93I8CHtaa	i really hope that he is ok|`|0ytjj1EGaa	Yes    He Has No Broken Bones Or Something    After Sundays Test It will Be Announced How Much time he needs to RECOVER      Kobe Must Be Feeling BAD
2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	woah. calm down.     he'll be ok, and he'll probably be back in a few weeks. Just hope the MRI doesn't reveal anything to bad.    Lakers have plenty of debt, they will be fine.|`|0ytjj1EGaa	Yes    He Has No Broken Bones Or Something    After Sundays Test It will Be Announced How Much time he needs to RECOVER      Kobe Must Be Feeling BAD|`|NJtjJA8Baa	MC, are you okay? That doesn't sound like you. I havent seen so many swear words in a question.  He will be fine, but the Griz are just ar$es.  Do you mean knee? Because keen doesn't sound right.|`|EiPdBAaeaa	He will be fine! X rays were negative so that's a good thing. I don't he will be out for no more than a month!|`|Cb5N6UaQaa	I feel your pain dude. Let's hope he recover in time. This really sets me off too. Whatever it's worth to be this angry. It's just too hardcore. Whatever see ya later.
6tGYe5roaa	Whether Jessica Simpson is hot or not, Romo will do what he does best: choke during big games.|`|RKMWeMk9aa	Hopefully he won't be steamrolled by Jessica Simpson in bed for his sake lol.|`|XZTwrn2Qaa	choke|`|dDhTMacAaa	ahh so your one of the lonely media guys that gets his paycheck when a celebrity puts on a few.    ;)|`|utaxvtZZaa	Homo doesn't choke. The whole team chokes, beginning with its loser, crybaby owner. When Jones dies the Cowboys will be good again. Jones can't help but be a loser because he's more interested in himself and the publicity he can generate around players like TO, PacMan and Homo than he is about the team. And Jones is such a wimpy little crybaby when they lose - that's the part I like most.|`|7t7XzXsVaa	Who''s Tony Homo?|`|KNTofuxMaa	Will the haters never cease? Y'all just LOVE talkin bout dem Cowboys. Admit it, You guys love to hate my team! Haha... It's all good, though. I aint mad at ya.|`|TuOp3hNPaa	ah jus choke as usual|`|r4J2sPHzaa	i think if they keep terrell owen the team will continue to fall i mean he is so drama filled that if someone walks in front of him he complains if they keep him no one else will be allowed to touch the ball but hay they are the giants rivals so i vote to keep t.o right where he's at lol|`|4KTe107Yaa	bite me JENN  Something will happen to Dallas. Something always does.|`|rNUyV1EYaa	I think Romo would do a lot better without a certain egomaniac wide receiver that drops half of the passes he throws his way.    I won't name names....|`|DvKpx0Reaa	what about donovan mcnabb?  tell me when he'll stop choking too.  and since he doesn't have a hot girlfriend as an excuse...guess he just plain sucks.|`|LtOxnF0kaa	Choke as usal|`|BbZn25J4aa	i say choke|`|LpR9sLSlaa	jessica still looks good  so Tony will have to find a new excuse    Jerry Jones is the real cancer there    he can't keep a good coach, that can control the Locker room    either they quit, or he fires them
uiRkBwa9aa	MAN THATS WAT I WAS THINKING EXCEPT THAT I THINK STONE COLD WILL HAVE A TITLE REIGHN FOR A BIT LONGER THAN U RECKON AND RASIE HELL IN THE WWE AGAIN!!!!!!! STILL I WOULD LOVE TO SEE THAT MATCH!!!|`|3k4tPNTGaa	Ya dt wud be gud bt i know austin will nt cm to fight against a new wrestler. He wud wrestle only a veteran like hogan or rock only. Moreover wwe should not go for triple threat match for royal rumble winner. He deserve a one on one match only. Triple threat wud be unfair. I think orton wil put his tittle challenge on hold and will challenge vince for wrestlemania and cena wud fite perhaps Batista (if he gt alrite before wrestlemnia) or jericho.|`|UWJinEbIaa	Yup, HBK vs Undertaker vs CM Punk.....just do a quick title switch on Raw.|`|CK0RLmlfaa	thats exactly what i was thinking but it would be better to have a singles match but make it in a punjabi prison or something|`|K52jiCEqaa	randy orton|`|hL3eS2zKaa	I think that theyre should be a Fatal Fourway match between Taker, Triple H, and Umaga. A new twist on things.|`|OHBvEYKHaa	they should not have a triple threat no matter what|`|3I6YUfg0aa	it was a triple threat last year...they need something different, fatal fourway would be good :)|`|TBu2iaPaaa	that would be awesome
Pt7ES5MOaa	the undertaker is because he 16 and 0 at wrestlemaina|`|KIOR56r6aa	agree.|`|UWJinEbIaa	Undertaker matches were rarely the match of the night.  HBK had several:  The ladder match vs Scott Hall, the Iron Man vs Bret, WM20 vs Benoit & HHH.|`|CK0RLmlfaa	no he is he been in more wrestlemanias hes helped that business so much its not funny he truly is mr. wrestlmania    ps.why are you so obsessed with the deadman|`|OHBvEYKHaa	they call him mr.wrestlemania because he did an awesome entrace|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	HBK has had his biggest matches at Wrestlemania's. When he went into WrestleMania XIV against Stone Cold, he had a severe back injury but performed. That takes heart and guts. This is one of the many reasons HBK is called Mr. Wrestlemania.    I am not taking anything away from Taker.|`|oAjbBLDpaa	Mr. Wrestlemania is not given on the guy who wins the most but the guy who puts on the most memorable performance. Michaels is just an amazing performer and he got that title because of his performance skills.|`|K52jiCEqaa	your right|`|KH9bbeCNaa	agreed Taker is mr Wrestlemania but i dont think it works coz that title works on someone who talks a lot and Taker doesnt    HBK always talks about how he is the showstopper, mr wrestlemania and the heart break kid but ive never heard the undertaker refering to himself as the phenom or the demon of death valley, all he says is "i will take your soul" and stuff like that|`|w2rEXTSXaa	OMG!! i would love to see that that would be HBK vs. Cena all over again but taker is stronger than cena|`|kST3xlDnaa	HBK is still Mr.Wrsetlemania it's just who he's working for JBL wont let him be mr.wrestlemania he wants to have the spot light. Undertaker could also be mr.wrestlemania for now but whenever NBK is back bye bye undertaker for being mr.wrestlemania.|`|q1OoJc0Laa	They both are.    Let's just leave it there.|`|WpaQKpckaa	I like the way you think|`|yb67y0AWaa	TRUE THAT I AGREE WITH U
FRmu0HFEaa	I would jump with joy and chant "E-C-F'king-W!"|`|E6RNcXxeaa	i would be very exited. The original ECW was well ORIGINAL. they did a lot of stuff that had never been done before and they could take guys with apsolutley no wrestling talent and turn them to stars.|`|7rpILeYtaa	about time|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	Heyman would probably just get punted in the head by Orton.|`|eJDRyYNaaa	I would poop with joy.|`|KH9bbeCNaa	god i hate the new ecw|`|yw8IeiPNaa	YES!Oh hell yes!! all hail Paul Heyman.The greatest wrestling promoter of all time.|`|cE8SQUEbaa	WOW!!!   I would be jumping with joy...

u3FqxhY8aa	Nada is a spanish word that means nothing, so it is some Fed fans taking a dig at Nadal.  Roger probably wouldn't want that said though from his fans since he is friends with Rafa.|`|NdTy3twjaa	Well Nada in Spanish means nothing.  So the Federer fans are basically saying that Rafael Nadal is nothing, "nada".|`|U7BkuEU9aa	I've never seen anyone refer to him as "Nada"...me and many more people (Fed included) call him "Rafa", which is short for Rafael...|`|WF1jO5oSaa	They call him Rafa not Nada. Its like a fun nickname.|`|9hC7bbf7aa	Disrespectful for the   1 tennis player. He is truly a proud patriotic Spaniard and loves his country... Whatever the past history of his real name was a couple of centuries ago ? Because what it means in Spanish, shame , shame for those who made insincere mockery !  It's not helping Federer's reputation at all, for Roger and Rafa still maintain incredibly respectful professional relationship with each other,which is uncommon in a competitive sports world. Whether they are   1 or   2, they always compliment each other's supremacy. Fed fans had better control of words  before they post the world wide comments.|`|gWLhIoIiaa	Nada is his real name. Back in the 1800's, the Nada family had to leave their home country of Uzbekistan for undisclosed reasons. They ended up in Spain, and to disguise their identities they not only assimilated to Spanish culture but decided to add an "l" to the family name. Why "l"? Because it is easiest alphabet to write: you just make a line. This went well for many decades but as you can see a lot of Federer fans have done some investigation and uncovered some of the truth about his family's shady past. It is still uncertain what happened that had them kicked out of their home country but one thing is for sure is the name issue. So now some refer to him by his real last name so the family can know they can't hide from the truth anymore. We are on to you, NADA!
vgO8E0NCaa	It depends what players the Lakers get after trading Kobe.     By the way, the Heat didnt drop 30 games the season after they won the title. They dropped 37 games 2 seasons after they won the title.|`|C0KwC6DBaa	yeah!|`|WmK8svvnaa	Yes. No. Maybe. I don't know. Can you repeat the question?|`|3teWTOPqaa	Yeah I would. We are not Boston fans, we don't jump on another team's wagone and chant MVP for the other team when our team sucks.    Boston has no pride!|`|H7AcXAyaaa	Haha|`|YeNp4m8haa	yeah
pEvHSTvCaa	with the roster they have they definitely have a chance- it's just a matter of the players stepping it up- showcasing the incredible talent that they don't always display and triano stepping up as a coach. one of their main issues is putting too much on chris bosh- he's not as good as everyone makes him out to be. but as long as bargnani keeps doing what he's doing, o'neal can keep playing the way he did on friday (30th) and the refs start making fair calls unlike friday's game against the bucks- then they can get the playoff spot, but they have to really work and earn it. as long as they do that, the refs call fair, and triano starts putting the right combinations on the floor then they've got it (on friday he shouldn't have sat bargnani- he was playing amazing and as soon as triano takes him off and puts him back on he loses it- you can't take a "hot" player off the floor- and i dont mean looks)            hope this helped                  -erica |`|ZAh8CEoGaa	By trading Jermaine O'Neal to another player that is not as injury proned as JO.|`|vgO8E0NCaa	yea they have a chance.    Even the Thunder have a chance.|`|GBGcI509aa	l,kk;ghg;
MHJ3ZjV7aa	I am about 2 years ago the stunk like my gym socks after they have been used. But Patrick Kane as exceled in his position to help the Blackhawks start winning games.|`|N1OnviExaa	Not at all. All last season you could tell they were improving and getting better as the season progressed, and they just barely missed the playoffs. With Brian Campbell and Christobal Huet being added to a rising team I think their current success was to be expected.    I also might add that Joe Quenneville has been awesome behind the bench.|`|DLDuro19aa	I predicted them to finish 4th in the West at the beggining of the season and that's where they are now. No surprise... if anything not enough goals outta that team.     * Go Oilers|`|U8HSSSswaa	I knew they would be good this year, because they've had a lot of young players, and now they're veterans, so they've lead the team to success.|`|1d075957915818a61f13ee910c562440aa	Not really, they have the potential with all the young talent they have.  It's about time it's been put to good use.

NXktxy8jaa	As a matter of fact, yes. I was at The 2008 Slammy Awards In Philadelphia back in December and there was this drunk guy next to me. He kept talking to me during the whole show and every five minutes he would go and buy another beer. It was funny though because the section that I was sitting in (behind the announce tables, 4th row) was the "Heel" Section. We all cheered for Chris Jericho, Randy Orton, And JBL when He made his very fast appearance. He was the only one who cheered for John Cena And Jeff Hardy.     Another incident similar to this happened, but we go back to The Pay-Per-View "In Your House" which occured in the late 90's in Hershey, Pennsylvania. We sat very close to the ring, 3rd row to be exact. There was this kid in front of us who held up this red sign during the whole show. My uncle was sitting behind him and he got pissed. My uncle told the kid that he was going to burn the kids sign with his Lighter if he didnt put his sign down. So he listened, and he put it down. Then after the event as we were in the parking lot, we saw the kid again. My uncle went up to him and asked if he was going to the event tomorrow. He said "What event are you talking about?" And my uncle Said, "In Your Basement!" So the kid freaked out and ran.    We were lucky that no one who was stupid was sitting near us at Wrestlemania 17, 21, and 23. And hopefully when we go to Wrestlemania 25, no one will.|`|lGO7XlyBaa	No, I live in Canada and wrestling's never there :(    Although, your story was funny, I'm glad you were booing Cena :)|`|3I6YUfg0aa	I was at an event in England, and i got annoyed with this bloke beside me booing Orton, now I know hes meant to be booed, but when I was cheering for him, he told me to shut up.|`|Nzqt4Qu7aa	Yes! EVERYTIME I go, I have the mosy annoying people sit next to or around me. It's like seriously people, not everyone in this arena is going to agree with you on what wrestlers you think are good. Ignorant people, ugh. Can't stand it.|`|S0u3HKzhaa	That's funny,I have done that too cheered heels and booed faces for the fun of it.But what drives me crazy are the really cocky people and the people with the signs that they hold and up the whole show.      I was at a live event of Smackdown and ECW in Detroit in like 2006 the Tuesday after the Great American Bash right.So King Booker was the champion and had like balloon's fall down for him and everything.So anyway Rey Mysterio came out and attacked him,then these like 5,ten year olds in front of my friend and I started cheering like crazy.That's okay but they had this huge @ss sign saying Rey is Smackdown and they waved it around the whole show right in front of us.We asked them several times to hold it down for a bit.And they kept giving us smart @ss remarks.I'm telling you i had to tell my friend Cole not to punch little kids like 1000 times.These were very rude kids.The ironic thing is they always put the sign down when the camera's went by.    Then when ECW went on air they held up the same sign and my friend kept yelling put it down he's not even on the damn show!It was pretty funny.    Then once a few years back at an Raw event in Toronto,these people behind us kept yelling wrestling's fake.I was like why the f*ck did you go if you hate it so much.And these guys were pretty drunk and kept giving us dirty looks and remarks.|`|xfzjr4uFaa	yeah! when smackdown and ecw came to bg there was this guy who was beside me, and he kept screaming for the diva's to come into the stands and sit on his lap!|`|w2rEXTSXaa	this may sound weird but the 1st time i went to raw there waz these ppl who didnt move the entire time there were just watchin like it was law and order or something|`|Xkm4PstOaa	It's so funny....this last time I went to an event, I, like you, booed Cena and cheered for Jericho and Orton; and this 13 or 14 year old kid wanted to fight me!  My friend and I couldn't stop laughing!    But I've been to a few events, and I tend to zone everyone out!  I payed for these damn seats, I can yell whatever I want!!!

w9kSGLBxaa	I am going to copy and paste an answer I gave just a couple of days ago.     This is a question that has been asked A LOT. Quite frankly I used to agree but a couple of thing that should be taken in to consideration. Do you think it will actually change any thing. Most of the MMA questions are from MMA fanboys will wind up here any ways, either to piss people off or because they do not know the difference. This is also a very very slow moving section. They say that in P&S questions can get asked up to 109 per minute. I can stay off of here for three days and go back to the question I left off with rather easy just going through the pages. How slow do you think it would be with out the MMA questions. YA YA I know quality over quantity. But if this section does not have enough quantity it does not make Y!A any money and thus gets deleted.    Also I would like you to read all of Judomofo's answer on this subject  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...    I am going to give you some other links here in a second showing that Y!A has no intent of doing this  http://suggestions.yahoo.com/detail/?pro...    http://suggestions.yahoo.com/detail/?pro...    http://suggestions.yahoo.com/detail/?pro...    http://suggestions.yahoo.com/detail/?pro...|`|6rPRzT9Faa	definitely|`|UWJinEbIaa	Of course and why not give MMA  PPV, kickboxing, karate, judo, their own sections too......if football can be split 6 different ways why can't Martial Arts!|`|U7oJrc3faa	Well considering MMA stands for Mixed Martial Arts I'd say it's appropriately placed in the 'martial arts' section...|`|YDpT2ClBaa	and you think we like bruce lee. you guys can keep his question in the mma section,   if you look at most of the questions posted today the majority of them were on the mma event of tonight.    i wish you luck getting the section split,  but over all the martial arts section is one of the smaller ones on y/a      edit: clowns your links are dead|`|hBLNIlYGaa	then go somewhere else. there are plenty of mma forums online. go find one of them.  this isn't a "conversation" forum, it's a question and answer forum. unfortunately half the people who give answers don't know much about the subject they're talking about.    martial arts are martial arts....traditional, mixed, whatever. if it wasn't for traditional arts there would be no mma. it really isn't that different to be honest with you.|`|w74qWx0raa	I could see it but there really not that many questions that it needs it

DvKpx0Reaa	they're scared if that if they allow a pop singer to perform they might pull a janet jackson...and i see that happening if miley cyprus performs (which is never THANK GOD)|`|tbhEBdITaa	You don't have any taste in music, and I don't think there has ever been a country singer that has played during the super bowl halftime.    Rock also tends to appeal to every guy that is over 15 years old and has a pair. If you think about the past superbowl halftime performers (The Rolling Stones, Prince, Tom Petty, and Bruce Springsteen), it's quite clear that these bands were the best of their time. They have a huge amount of experience, and the shows are always great.|`|BbZn25J4aa	to be honest i have no idea and i think it either that or somebody like miley cyrus     and i think at the super bowl that justin timberlake and janet jackson thing happend and yea|`|4n6yhUbyaa	um its always rock not country!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! duh any one who watches the super bowl would no that|`|w3Vg1xLAaa	Since Janet Jackson's little UNOWHT it's been guys who are old and started performing say before Larry Fitzgerald was born. It's a so called safe act to get guys who make the young whippersnappers fall asleep. Really it's quite annoying. Get some Kanye West or Coldplay or katy perry or somebody who actually interests those who were born after Vietnam.  P.S. I'm American|`|XwAtYZDBaa	Because a bunch of old heads sit around and think of a performer who won't offend anyone|`|Gy1YkHoeaa	Oh God, Bruce Springstien is so old and boring and blah. They should get someone interesting like the Scissor Sisters!    If Brucey is going to dye his eyebrows they should'nt be 3 shades darker than that little bit of hair he has left! Halftime was boooring!|`|UAHjJpC0aa	Springsteen is a Country singer?
eJDRyYNaaa	They could start by firing Hornswoggle and John Cena (a.k.a. Miss Piggy). John Cena is attracting all the 6 year olds because he looks like Miss Piggy.     P.S. I like your avatar.|`|5864fJdSaa	the question says it all, "6 year olds". the wwe needs to get rid of the pg rating and slap back on the 14.|`|OHBvEYKHaa	props to powerhouse that would make wwe perfect|`|7rpILeYtaa	ive got more then one thing:      Bring back the original ECW    Get rid of the PG era    Bring back the Attitude era|`|Xkm4PstOaa	More blood, more hardcore matches, more unpredictability, and less Cena...  That's what I think!|`|K52jiCEqaa	this might be offending but do like before show the ladies so they can do their stuff
AtJXqxN2aa	Well as for match type I'll say the 2007-present hardcore matches. It usually involves a chair and.....well a chair and that's it. But I do agree on you with No DQ.    I know you didn't ask but a most overrated match will have to be Taker vs Batista at WM23. There was nothing special. How was it best match of 2007?|`|q1OoJc0Laa	Last Man Standing matches used to be all the rave, but now all they do is hit each other in the back with a chair.    Where's the blood!!?|`|w2rEXTSXaa	uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh did u SEE taker vs. foley|`|3k4tPNTGaa	Who sd taker vs foley(HIAC) is overrated. Foley gt his a** whopped badly in dt match. A piece o table sticked up in his nose and it ws clearly visible. He took 2 of the biiggest bump in wrestling history. Even after dt he gt taste of thumbtacks. He almost broke himself in half and u guys r sayin dt it ws overrated?????????? Its so mean.|`|mWXKwjf4aa	Last Man Standing.    The ending of the matches is so lackluster because the end of the match always ends up with one person laying on the ground for the 10 count while the other person just stands there and does nothing.|`|EHK1RzpAaa	I believe Hell In a Cell is most overrated right now (it use to be great), its basically like a hardcore match with a huge cage surrounding the ring that they sometimes bash each other against. But that is it.|`|UWJinEbIaa	Hogan vs Andre.|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	I would agree with you. I also am not a big fan of hardcore matches. Let me hit you with a chair 15 times and see if you get up. I can see a chair shot ending a match but not starting it off.|`|CK0RLmlfaa	hell in a cell because now they never go up top or anything|`|Kh4p4gPXaa	I perfer the classic "No holds barred"  no "No DQ"  even if they are the same thing (except,  in No Holds Barred a chair or exposed turnbuckle will end it,  in No DQ its outside interference that will)    Most overrated match?   They dont do it often but im going with the Ironman match.   It ends up being an endless supply of rest holds.|`|MG0TqatQaa	I definitely think it's BIG WRESTLERS vs small wrestlers. Like BIG SHOW vs. Jimmy Wang Yang or UMAGA vs. wrestlers that aren't even on the roster yet. I mean really i have faith in people, but c'mon I'd rather eat the Boogeyman's worms than fight a man 4 times taller than me and with 7 years more experience.
cE8SQUEbaa	Taker, cause he's not like Shawn Michaels...  SmackDown! for life..|`|N2FBBCAGaa	Taker-RAW|`|7c5a4f1b8f41b363de63ba1312283001aa	John cena|`|cFRmQMMeaa	HBK is a much much much better wrestling talent    i like sd better cuz of MVP|`|EA7oEQwMaa	taker- raw  taker shuld be on raw with kane.  its only a matter of time b4 the brothers of desstruction get back 2gether|`|AA11482019	HBK.  Shawn Michael has more wrestling talent than the Undertaker.|`|4tvI9WYjaa	i think shawn michael's had a better career then the undertaker shawn michael's is the first ever grand slam winner and but undertaker is the better wrestler out off the two but shawn michael's is better entertainer   smack down is better show but raw has better story lines|`|e9YFTyzZaa	hahaha....ARE YOU SERIOUS,,,they're ALL FAKE!  'WWE' SUCKS, big time!|`|kST3xlDnaa	HBK-RAW        hbk because he is more of the wrestler and has better moves and undertaker is more scarry then hbk but right now I would say taker but really it is HBK.        Raw because it's just better then Smackdown.|`|4ad21c8bd9ed4a91c2d622b918f0138daa	I like both and i just can't see one being better than the other. To me they are the best in this business today and are legendary competitors. I wish i could answer but i don't know myself here.    Raw is definitely ahead of smackdown because they are the flagship show so obviously vince makes sure it's okay. Also Raw is live while smackdown is taped. I think SD has potential to be good as or better than raw because the SD roster has talent and they could be used correctly.
5vXgcAbCaa	I know. He can do what he is doing now well..... but he's always doing the same thing. He's turning into another Ric Flair. He just can't do much anymore. I hope he retires soon, I don't want to see him get any worse. His matches are almost as predictable as Miz and Morrison's.|`|3onacSoxaa	Yes shawn Michaels is HBK  HBK stands for Heart Broke Kid    *Something like that|`|EA7oEQwMaa	he is just doing wat hes supposed to. but he will be bak 2 hiself. trust me.|`|ZBcqZG2Saa	He looks old and tired.  I am tired of seeing him and would like him to take some time off.|`|3cQx8ZFSaa	Shawn Michaels needs to retire, he's a great wrestler but he too worn out and he should retire before his career ends up trash like Victoria|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	He's playing his part. Just wait, at Wrestlemania you will see a different HBK. The Showstopper will return.
WiIUEObTaa	the playing of national anthems sporting other events started canada 1914, united states 1917. it was to honour the soldiers who were dying in world war one. it will always be played. total disrespect to every military, patriot ever to disgrace the anthem of your country. just ignorant non athletic fools . all they are at the event for is to be seen. last sport they played was at the age of ten. to stupid , physically unfit to be in the military. live on credit cards and their phony clone lack of personality. pathetic no-minds. i think i agree with you.|`|RqJaLTr5aa	i agree...come on people show some respect for our country!!|`|YhfMrppSaa	Its u, we don't. its honor another word for ur country.|`|m3L6pLBaaa	well ask all the idiots that voted a president in that don't do it what do you expect. i always to oh yeah hillary clinton puts her hand on the wrong side of her chest too. interesting huh. i do it always and always will.|`|fdtDjDfbaa	You hate ppl who put their hands behind their backs...?

I find it disrespectful to wear a hat inside a church even though I'm not religious. I agree that if you live in America and the anthem is being played, you should at least show respect to your country. But sadly, you can't make people do what they plain don't want to do.

uxregJ0faa	He will be back. MRI will clear everything up.|`|sOae9LUzaa	Bynum's sprain and it takes him 2-4 games to heal up? Paul only took 3 minutes. Bynum must be really soft like Gasol to not be able to take a hit from Kobe.|`|sCHUFUXsaa	*sigh* finally its not that bad..really..    just a sprain.  i know its an injury but not as worst as last year.    hope he comes back vs the celtics..|`|GBGcI509aa	Hopefully.    I need the Lakers to SQUASH the Celtics in the FINALS.|`|8d03fcb2a7fe3a4e9c78ebd702581c44aa	were still not in the clear with andrew, the x rays dont show much all they show is bone damage  the mri will show if he has any ligament damage etc..  but hopefully he will be back soon|`|kX1Kr8Nzaa	It's not serious i just know it, the mri will be negative too he will be back soon enough|`|EiPdBAaeaa	Damn I still can't believe he went out! But I think he will be out for the rest of the road trip!|`|fQ9n37uHaa	that was depressing, and i have a bad feeling. X rays do not show the real damage MRI does, it's obvious he didn't break anything but I'm worried about a torn ligament or ligaments. Let's hope it's not to serious as long as he makes a nice rapid recovery. i really wanted him for the cavs celtics road games but if we don't have him i don't mind so long as he isn't out more than 2 weeks

Jumping a player off the face-off because your getting beat on your own ice? And the announcers even bigger tool bags for not acknowledging the fact that Crosby pulled a jersey over a guys head who clearly wasn't anticipating a fight at all.

lWoxFHhFaa	Vince McMahon fired Stone Cold Steve Austin long before Donald Trump ever had a show on TV.|`|444pPdy5aa	Vincent Kennedy McMahon|`|5vXgcAbCaa	Well, Vince was the first out of the two to say it..... but you can't really blame Trump for stealing it. It's an extremely common term. It's just the way to tell someone that they lost their job. So Trump really didn't do anything wrong by using it.|`|S0u3HKzhaa	Vince McMahon has been saying You're Fired long before Donald was even on television.But the apprentice was a well watched programing,so is the wwe but the apprentice is more likely to get publicity then wrestling because it is looked at as an under-rated television programing.So people look as it as Donald Trump's catch phrase opposed  to Vince McMahon's.Although Vince said it before Donald.|`|JRGttmejaa	vince|`|KG3MptIdaa	Vince McMahon... I'm sure many a people before him have used it as a catch phrase, but he was before Trump. At least the didn't try to copyright it like Paris Hilton did for "That's Hot"|`|8gEMrNSBaa	Vince possibly took that from the professional   sports industry, and in particular from football  general managers. The first "You're fired" ever  spelled on the other hand, is perhaps attributable   to a dragon, who grew tired towards one of his   admirers or servants and "fired" him.|`|Xkm4PstOaa	Vince McMahon was saying it long before The Trump!|`|NZKramllaa	Vince McMahon, he was the first to come up with it way before The Apprentice came on air, Some how Donald took the catch phrase and ran with it.
x9GODf8eaa	It would be kind of hard considering they are in separate part of the stadium. I don't think the rivalries are as fierce between GM's.

GvGHtyLnaa	Well yeah have you ever watched the all-star game events they are all friend (well most). Even with my high school team we are major rivals with this team and I am friends with about 3 players on the other team and we actually talk before, after and during the game.|`|oJsrGmmPaa	I speak English. I don't have a clue what you're saying.|`|U8HSSSswaa	They're all friends outside, except for those select idiots such as Sean Avery and people like him. But certain teams have been rivals like Boston and the Canadians for example, and they play for pride when they play each other, because they want to go home knowing they've beaten their rivals.    They can't be there to make the game more exciting, the fans, not the players, came up with these rivalries, not the league commissioners.|`|XlZTvIqvaa	the teams know each other very well and are determined to beat each other
Xkm4PstOaa	Great question....  Oh, the possibilities!!!    I would be a surprise entrant in the Money in the Bank match at Wrestlemania.  I would, of course, win it!  Then I would wait for John Cena to win his match (because he never loses); I would take a referee with me to the ring and I would beat Cena down!  Winning the Championship and being the best of all time!    ***DAMN! What's with the thumbs down people?  Can't I have my own little fantasy?  Jeez...***    Then I awaken from my dream.....|`|KH9bbeCNaa	how i beat up McMahon for liking money more than his fans|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	Randy Ortons Manager, plain and simple, it would be my dream job.|`|FRmu0HFEaa	I would debut at the Royal Rumble as Entrant number 30 and win the Rumble by throwing Cena and Orton out of the ring at the same time and feud with Undertaker for the WWE Championship and challenge him for the title in Buried Inferno Alive Match at WrestleMania and finally end the unbeaten streak for Taker|`|3k4tPNTGaa	wel i wud do a storyline to bring back austin coz in his aa interviews he said if wwe provide him better storyline (like attitude era) he can come bk. So i will put my all thinking power to bring him bk and throw him in a feud against undertaker at wrestleania 26 and finally breaking his winning streak but after match austin will hug undertaker and give a thanks giving speech to him and hv a beer bash with undertaker. That wud b a hell of a scene.|`|w2rEXTSXaa	i would have batista come back in the main event jbl vs. HBK cuz hbk had a match 2 see if he would continue workin for jbl and Batista beats up jbl 4 HBK 2 get the win.then next week they all start talkin and HBK and batista team up against jbl and batista and HBK become friends against jbl for The 1st time since ric flair's retirement. WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!|`|E6RNcXxeaa	I would like to see a Goldust vs Cody Rhodes feud. If booked right it could elavat Cody because Dustin Rhodes is very creative and he is pretty good with the mic. It could cement Cody as a dominant force and a great heel.|`|rJMZdp04aa	Apparently No One understands the Question.    I would have Matt Hardy Continue to bash Jeff for a few weeks until NWO.  Jeff Hardy is in the SD! EC as the 6th Participant.  Show , Kozlov ,  & 'Taker get Eliminated.  Final 3 are Edge , HHH , & Jeff.  HHH gets Eliminated.  Jeff hits a Twist of Fate on Edge.  Jeff Goes to the top of a Pod. The EC door is opened for HHH's Exit.  CHRISTIAN comes running down with a Steel Chair!  He enters the EC & Crushes Jeff with the Chair.  Jeff falls to the Mat.  Edge gets the Pin , Retains , & Looks Completely Stunned.    It's Revealed that Matt AND Christian were behind Jeff's "Attacks".    Matt vs. Jeff at WM25 in a "Cameron" Street Fight.  HHH vs. Edge for WWE Championship.    Christian Attacks Matt , Jeff , & Edge in their WM Matches.    4 Way Feud Throughout 2009.      *EDIT* -The Legacy Continues - My bad.  I wasn't trying to sound like a D*ck.  The Question itself isn't Structured in the best way.  I just answered by how I interpeted it.
xWnZ1lqPaa	Hey,my name is the man
NNn84vTCaa	No, Wrestlemania will happen, besides do you think WWE would really stop them selves from getting $$$$$$$$ just because of a Storyline. Its all kayfaybe, Wrestlemania will continue, and Randy Orton will win the WWE title there.|`|vyKJ4sdtaa	no there will match between randy and shane micman|`|9Jvjo7zOaa	I don't think so. Randy is a pretty good part of the WWE and is pretty entertaining which makes the storyline great. If he gets fired then there will be one less obnoxious air head and one less entertainer in the business.|`|w2rEXTSXaa	yea cuz then he would have nothin 2 regret on his death bed except 4 everyone mad at him for ruinin monday tuesday and friday nights|`|a0RgVoScaa	I seriously doubt it. Even Hulk Hogan couldn't stop Wrestlemania.|`|3k4tPNTGaa	Who the hell is hulk hogan to stop wrstlemania. Dt ws BS. Wrestlemania 25 is d biggest event of wwe of all time , its gonna b bigger dn any wrestlemania ever. How cud even u think dt wrestlemania wil b stopped by orton. Who the hell is orton to stop wrestlemania. This is all fake we all know it but still u r askin such childish questions.|`|cE8SQUEbaa	nope...|`|NZKramllaa	No, Its kayfabe. Vince wouldn't let that much amount of money go down hill for anything and Anyone could tell the McMahon's has every or even more rights to sue Randy for kicking Vince in the head.|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	The only one besides Vince who could stop Wrestlemania is God himself.    It's a storyline threat.    Are you two jokers below me for real? I'm not trying to be disrespectful but......  WWEASHLE... and Kurt just n/m.|`|CK0RLmlfaa	dude its all fake|`|OHBvEYKHaa	no thats bull**** that would never happen|`|3I6YUfg0aa	he said he'd stop Wrestlemania IF he lost his job.|`|AtJXqxN2aa	I'm guessing your probably a mark. Dude relax it's fake. You actually think Randy is going to sue WWE. that's what you call adding drama to a storyline. It's all planned out. It's a damn storyline.     It's people like you are the reason why people call wrestling fans gay. Some of us are smarks. Then agian only a smark will know what a smark is.|`|eJDRyYNaaa	No, his fat legs would prevent him from doing so.
3I6YUfg0aa	no, as people feuding against the McMahons is interesting.|`|KH9bbeCNaa	they do but for the storyline to happen it was required that mr Mcmahon dont hav a bodyguard so that randy could attack him
VjAoRpIhaa	no, i am always the best team. i have played 2 complete seasons.the 1st record was 75-1-6 and the 2nd was 82-0-0. perfect season in the post season|`|MHJ3ZjV7aa	Yes I was in dynasty with the oilers in nhl 04 and won the Stanley Cup against the New Jersey Devils|`|ko2Iskl0aa	Yeah...Leafs. :P lol...  on (PS2) NHL 08
Xkm4PstOaa	He didn't connect his problems to steroids.  He connected it to some kind of disease....I don't remember the name of the disease, but it has something to do with people being more violent; hence kicking McMahon in the head!|`|S0u3HKzhaa	No that isn't what he means.He isn't trying to connect his problems to steroids.They are trying to make it look like he has this disorder that I can't recall the exact term for,but it makes people not in their right mind set and when provoked they go off.Explaining his kicking to Vince's head.Although I don't think he really has the disorder,it is just for the storyline.I think he only has suffered from anger management issues is all.But none of that has to do in connection with steroids it is just for the storyline on why he kicked Vince.|`|K52jiCEqaa	he's in steroids your lying he's the best|`|w2rEXTSXaa	i think that its probably true he should start takin them now have u seen him
hL3eS2zKaa	I would have booed him because what (storyline, at least hope so) he said was just too harsh to say to someone like your brother, unless you are Kane and Taker of course. But I cant believe it, he showed ZERO remorse, and he said that Jeff wasnt his brother anymore. So sad..... I think that the WWE has gone too far with the storylines.|`|eJDRyYNaaa	I'd cheer for him!|`|AtJXqxN2aa	My God. Vince is loving this. Seeing all these concerned fans. IT'S  A FREAING STORYLINE, SET UP AND FAKE.     I wouldn't boo or yayy Matt cause I never liked him. I would boo Jeff anyday compare to Matt.     I support Matt anyday and one must think that this could possibly real emotions Matt is expressing. face it, the guy passed his drug tests and got a belt on th show that no one watches.    Jeff screwed up 3 times in WWE and once in TNA and got WWE gold. Because of that same reason you wanna see Jeff. We don't care about Matt. This a business. Titles shots are earned by impressing management, proper conduct backstage, not failing drug tests.    At the end of the day it sadly boils down to that. And in this case Jeff is the villian here. Not Matt    Anyways both Hardys suck. Especially Jeff.|`|MHJ3ZjV7aa	I would not boo him and I would forgive what he did!|`|TBu2iaPaaa	i would of done  both because i would like him and hate and him at the same time no because its not his fault he lost the ecw to jack swagger|`|p7BjjPtNaa	I liked Jeff before, but now I like Matt better.  He looks hotter as a heel and looking angry.|`|LmKCdK43aa	i would have booed him because i hate wrestling|`|GQWGLSexaa	I would yell you are finally HEEL!!!!!|`|q1OoJc0Laa	Finally...    a Hardy on Hardy feud.    Get ready world...|`|n22Xcyqeaa	I'll boo Jeff Hardy more.|`|uiRkBwa9aa	This stroyline is based on a real life problem between the 2|`|ePvvGUu3aa	I would actually boo him to put him over. Then probably start up the crowd to boo him, so Vince knows that this is a positive for Matt and to give him that extra push. Do I blame him? I'm a fan of both and I can't blame anything on anyone. I'm sorry if I don't answer the question you wanted me to answer with.|`|OfNTLq3Qaa	I would yell "It's about time."|`|OHBvEYKHaa	i would probaly boo him because he wasnt nice about it
3teWTOPqaa	I am pissed off right now!!|`|5vAh6U6Caa	no, it's unfortunate to see someone in pain just like gerald wallace a few days ago.  it's chris mihm's chance to shine|`|sOae9LUzaa	Expect them to use this excuse: "If only we had Bynum" when they lose their next couple of games.|`|2dgVkcVAaa	lakers fan,  what comes around,goes around.|`|5f6c8f16d3b0eff919c4db41f4c72b72aa	We're getting Dirk for Lamar and Ariza.|`|L0ft1eo7aa	i hope its minor but we still need to wait|`|KkOJD0Cxaa	what he was injured NOOOOOOOOO|`|jcmTCmfqaa	I hoped it's not serious|`|YeNp4m8haa	go away|`|EiPdBAaeaa	We made it to the finals witout bynum n without a healthy trevor ariza last year!! Bynum will be back in a few weekd though!|`|uxregJ0faa	Cry? We made it to the finals last year. We need to toughen up, but Bynum will be back
1fTsJSR2aa	Pierce is such a wimp. in the finals he started crying and and was limping on the way out but like 2 minutes later he came out running and was fine.|`|FG3qT6BWaa	This is a real answer and not a fake one..........who cares? GO CELTICS|`|mff1vstNaa	If you think Pierce can hear your message, then you must be an idiot. And if you think Pierce's injury is fake, then Bynum's injury must be fake. At least Pierce got hit by a teammate bigger and heavier than him.     Lakers will suffice without Bynum, it'll be like last year except no Ronnie Turiaf.|`|uxregJ0faa	Yea except Pierce cried on the floor for like 5 minutes. Then came back out running and hopping. Lol|`|wKGZ0h8Paa	Not real.  Bynum is just a cry baby.  He can't handle the pressure and pretend to have an injury.  X-Ray is negative.      Or if he did hurt his knee then it's Karma.  He got what he deserve for breaking Wallace rib and damage his lung.      Either way since you brought up the Paul Pierce thing.  At least Paul's got enough heart to come back and killed the Lakers.  Bynum have no heart.    Edit:  What's wrong with being Laker hater?  You  are obviously a Celtic hater and Pierce hater.  LOL.....HIPPOCRITE.|`|kNdVqq0Daa	i'll get you a tissue.   sucks to always lose to the Celtics, doesnt it?|`|AA10744471	My idol Pearl Pierce is no fake. He cried because he was really injured. I do not wish Bynum to be injured.|`|sOae9LUzaa	As Overrated said above, Pierce gets stabbed 11 times and comes back. Kobe gets pinky injury and cries, like against the Cavs.|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	For a few weeks it would be win-lose games for the rest of the season including postseason then a repeat of last year.|`|jcmTCmfqaa	They will do fine again other team except Boston|`|WK3Kx4Mkaa	DUDE SHUT UP YOU DONT KNOW IF HE IS FAKING OR NO SHUT UP AND GET A LIFE|`|h8G1x2ioaa	dude ur right dat was fake|`|5f6c8f16d3b0eff919c4db41f4c72b72aa	Lol, wtf?  Kobe didn't cry about his pinky or whatever finger.  And against the Cavs?  What did LeBron do with a cut cuticle last season?  Sit out 5 games then came off the bench.
f5ppAAn3aa	I enjoy baseball, kickball, volleyball, track, and kicking some ***.|`|fkZWfzQDaa	its no doubt basketball and football|`|k6M48eUMaa	Tennis!|`|deuYlqvwaa	TENNIS!! =D  i play it and watch it.|`|W6bKNcRjaa	My favorite to play is by far soccer.    I also enjoy watching professional football and baseball.
axxQzOCHaa	Even as a die-hard Canadien fan for over 20 years, I think this is long overdue.  Let's get some input from the Leafs fans on here: What took you so long eh ?|`|S4z7mefcaa	I hate the Leafs (also a Habs fan) but I always liked Dougie Gilmour.  Great player and great guy and yes, I think he deserved this recognition a little sooner.  He looked great on tv tonight and it was nice that he gave a shout out to Pat Burns.      Oh, and I see as usual the Leafs are squandering a big lead as usual.|`|Kh4p4gPXaa	They don't retire numbers,   they "honor" them.   93 will be available for whoever wants to wear it.    As far as rather they should honor him,  he was the best player on a decent team in the early 90s,  why not?|`|yRT5HjF0aa	^^^^  What he said, we honour them, don't retire them, but I doubt you'll see a whole lot of Leaf players wearing number 93 in the future.     We just lost our best player, Tomas Kaberle, for at least a month so I don't see us beating the Penguins.   EDIT: We did beat them, good we got one for Dougie, bad that we lost and furthered ourselves from drafting in the top 5.|`|oJsrGmmPaa	They're "honouring" number 93, not retiring it (even though I don't think anyone's going to wear it in a Leafs jersey again). The whole thing about honouring numbers is a little pointless to me (thank you, Ballard). If they're not going to retire it, so I really don't care. And yes, I do believe the Leafs can beat the Penguins tonight since they slaughtered the birds 7-2 or -3 on their last meeting.    Ah, yes, the insecurities of being a Habs fan. The difference is, retiring a number means that the number will never be used again for that team. Honouring a number means what it means.|`|2iuZdBXraa	Was a great ceremony honouring Gilmour.  He was cheated out of the Cup back in '93 with the missed call against Gretzky.  The Leafs could've beat Montreal in the finals, they had a better team than the Habs.  Everyone loved Gilmour, he was the consummate player.  And the Leafs beat the Pens 5-4 so the comment by the Habnot fan above goes in the garbage where it belongs.|`|IK8VW4FZaa	The greatest 2 years since we last won the cup in 67.  I remember it well.  I was at a friend's cottage at Wassaga Beach when we won game 5 against Gretzky and the Kings.  It was the Victoria Day long weekend.  I puked on the carpet that night.  I can also remember vividly when we eliminated the Wings and Dougie's double OT goal on Joseph.      I know that the players we have honoured of late(Sittler, Salming, Clark, Gilmour) would not compare to the other teams in the league that have actually won a Stanley Cup(Messier, Yzerman, Roy).  It is all we have and it makes the fans happy.    Dougie had that look in his eyes that was so intense.  It reminds me of the look in Rocket Richard's eyes.  For 2 seasons Gilmour played like the Rocket did.  No disrespect to Canadian fans.
fuYYRJXtaa	Al Jefferson or Kevin Durant should've gotten David West's spot...    And Ray Allen or Mo Williams should've gotten Rashard Lewis's spot.    3 Magic players in the All Star game! Wow!    Edit: @ Carmelo.  T-mac isn't playing in the All Star game.|`|98wFqBwSaa	Al Jefferson is a no name game on a no name team in a no name market.  David West is a solid player who runs the court with the best point guard in the league.  West deserves to be there.    You can argue that VC, Jason Terry, or D Will got "snubbed."|`|8qyofB7Zaa	I thought Ray Allen would get in, he's the Celtics leader in scoring the last time I checked and I thought he was snubbed out of the All Star MVP last year. (I hope fans won't vote for the MVP this year as either LeBron or Kobe would probably win no matter what). Also I expected (but not really a snub) that Steve Nash would get in because it's in Phoenix, but performance-wise he's declined to the point where he's no longer a top 5 guard in the West. Carmelo's omission is understandable as he's injured. Vince Carter probably shouldn't be there as he was overrated by fan voting for years, and the Nets have dropped in the standings. Al Jefferson may be better than David West but the coaches take standing into account; the difference between the Top 9 teams' records is huge compared to weak teams like Minnesota.|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	Ea|`|nynlxGmNaa	vince carter|`|bABkMrADaa	i do think t-mac should have not made the team, and melo is having his best year in my perspective, i dont think parker should have made it this year, rashard lewis should be in it he is a good player, i would kinda like to see micheal redd in it|`|N3AiQRJFaa	Mo Williams and Carmelo Anthony|`|kTbCarenaa	ray allen and carmelo anthony|`|eF60R7DPaa	Melo is the biggest snub|`|Qb5mffM9aa	Snub- Melo, Ray Allen (even though I hate the Celtics), David Lee, Al Jefferson    Undeserving- Rashard Lewis, Jameer Nelson|`|8IZZ4yENaa	the one that got me was that mo williams was not selected, instead they chose devin harris and jameer nelson, i think that those both dserve it but mo has been playing outstanding lately, he deserves a spot.|`|dDhTMacAaa	Allen Iverson didn't deserve to be there. If it wasn't for fan voting, something I don't like at all, he would be sitting at home watching Mo Williams, Devin Harris, and Jameer Nelson on the team.    And I agree with Al Jefferson - why? The man is taking a franchise that has been a HUGE dissapointment in the past few seasons and is leading them to a fabulous January record and giving the Timberwolves organization and fans hope.    (and it helps that he was the main piece in the deal where they departed with KG)|`|YeNp4m8haa	Carmelo Anthony|`|I3jXJEyAaa	CaRmElO AnThOnY|`|I1aDFQUPaa	My man Mo Williams on the Cavs. The man is scoring like he is LBJ. He has the biggest heart on the court. They should have gave him a chance.|`|AA10994784	David West, Allen Iverson, and Rashard Lewis shouldn't have made the All Star Team, and Shaq and Pau Gasol are definitely questionable picks...    I don't think Carmelo or Tony Parker should have made it either, because they were out injured half the time.    Al Jefferson really got hosed along with Deron Williams from Utah, I thought Paul Millsap from Utah should have made it also, Antawn Jamison also...|`|nQdTKnzVaa	Melo and Shaq doesn't deserve to be there|`|2WMAryV7aa	Ray Allen|`|uxregJ0faa	Carmelo was the one that got me. Carmelo played more than Tmac did and Tmac still gets in what is that.    Im saying Tmac was getting more votes.|`|sOae9LUzaa	Doesn't deserve:  Allen Iverson  Completely for popularity. That's it, and he ruined the Pistons.  David West (why?)  Vince Carter (The Nets aren't anywhere)    Snubbed:  Mo Williams  Ray Allen  Al Jefferson
FEzSIW8Daa	"The Microwave" is better because Vinnie could heat up in a minute and drop 20 before you even knew it.

2db7f31f8de2a63df2848a630426eea7aa	Kobe fell and backed up into Bynum's knee. Bynum was on the floor, moaning and holding his right knee. He had to be helped off the court.     They are calling it a knee sprain for now.     They took an X-ray, and its negative. This means that no bones have been damaged or broken, but they will have to take a MRI tomorrow in New York to see if he tore any tendons or ligaments. He will not return tonight.

oJsrGmmPaa	I don't know if I would use the word "great," but he's certainly a very good one.|`|axxQzOCHaa	He is doing well this year, but it's too early in his career to jump to conclusions.|`|92hPIyfaaa	hes got potental to be a star. this is his first season were hes torn it up|`|FG3qT6BWaa	He's having a great season for our Bruins. Hopefully we ink him a nice big contract after the season. He does have star potential.|`|U8HSSSswaa	He was one of the top scorers in the league while playing for Providence in the AHL last year, and he's been doing fairly well this year. I think he has a bright future in the NHL.
TMnaUQKhaa	I was in the same situation as you a couple of months ago also, lots of power and no control. I talked to my coach and he recommended the Head Microgel Extreme for me. Its an awesome racquet gives amazing control yet maintains all your power and its good for an intermediate player like you because its a "tweener" racquet meaning its head size and string patterns are a perfect match for improving players.     The recommended string tension for the racquet is 52--59 lbs and rule of thumb is to get it strung the median of these numbers ( around 55 lbs in this case) and tighten it next time you string it if you want more control (57 or higher) or loosen it (55 or lower). When you buy this racquet you also have to buy strings along with it and this really depends on what your looking for in your racquet. Strings either offer power, control, or durability and you get to choose what you want. There are also many brands out there to choose from but the recommended one for the Head Microgel is Head Sonic Pro which offers control. You can just get your raquet strung at a local sports store for $10 or so.    The weight of the Microgel is 11.10 ounces(when strung and 10.7 when unstrung) which is the recommended weight for an intermediate player. Raquets usually run from 10-12 ounces. For grips they run in different sizes. You dteremine your size by holding the racquet the way you normally do and the length between your index finger and your thumb should be the width of your index finger (basically 1cm or so). If your stuck between deciding between two grip sizes, choose the smaller one because it really easy to make a grip larger with either more grip or tape, which can also be purchased at a local sports store for around $10-15.    Well i hope this information helps, unfortunately Tennis Warehouse ran out of these racquets so i found it at MidWest Sports its a realiable website its where i got my racquet :)   http://www.midwestsports.com/head-microg...  btw the Head Microgel is $100 its on sale right now and if you like Richard Gasquet or Ivan Lubijic , they use this raquet:)|`|qixdmJ5raa	question starred. I would really like this answer also.|`|sptrtwxlaa	I need more detail on your "intermediate" level.   For starters u r looking in the right place.  The Babolat u selected is for pretty good players-if u look at the specs, its headlight, fast swing, low power, heavy frame.     i'll tell you about specifications and what thier fit for so you can decide dor yourself. The smaller the headsize, the better the player.  Federer uses a 90 in. (see http://www.tennis-warehouse.com/descpage...  most raquets are 100 (http://www.tennis-warehouse.com/descpage...   and oversize racquets can go up to 125 even-u wont c pros playing with these (http://www.tennis-warehouse.com/descpage...    Grip size dosent affect the player level but just the player's hand size. Better to choose a small grip (smallest is 4 1/8) and wrap overgrip to make it bigger than to get a grip that is too big (4 5/8)    The heavier the raquet, the better the player also bc the weight gives more control and less power. vise versa with lighter racquets.   this cooresponds to the headsize as the Prince speedport platinum weighs 9.5 oz while the wilson ksix is 12.5 oz.    this page could also help with more racquet knowledge:    http://www.tennis-warehouse.com/LC/lcfro...    good luck!
OfNTLq3Qaa	Yea, but I like the heel Edge a lot better. There are enough PG superstars already, Edge adds some much needed adult humor to the show as a heel.

KNTofuxMaa	The NFL  is king. It has been this way since I can remember. It's not surprising that 8 of the top ten most watched programs in history are Super Bowls. Like Howie said, Its' America's passion.|`|2e8927a3f6a8ce1bcb8c36d3d86c7439aa	well Like Howie Long said in his Hall of Fame Induction speech , He hit the nail right on the head ..     Baseball is America's Pastime     Football is America's Passion .|`|utaxvtZZaa	Just because the Super Bowl is so hyped. Plus it's only one game. Most of the other sports except NCAA basketball are a series so it's not as exciting. The BCS is a joke and as a result the college post-season isn't as interesting anymore (plus they drag it out way too long so by the championship you're kind of tired of it). Plus all the stupid commercials and half-time show just built to hype it more.

They don't know how serious it is with an X-ray. They are calling it a sprain for now.    The X ray is negative. But that just means no bones have been damaged or broken.     The MRI looks at the tendons and ligaments.     I wish you guys the best, hope he's ok.|`|kX1Kr8Nzaa	Much respect to you cavs in 09 there is nothing i hate more than rival fans who wish bad on a player just because they're the opposing team. I hate to see bynum go down again especially when he was starting to breakout from that injury shell left behind from last year. Just as he was looking like he would have another breakout season he get's injured AGAIN!, sigh. I really hope he get's better as to your question. I decdied to read up on this myself the moment i watch it happened. From what i read it can take anywhere from a few days to several weeks depending on the severity. Since the x-rays were negative that's one plus, now comes the real test the MRI if that's negative then it's time to celebrate becuase like the previous answers said he would only be out a few games.|`|uxregJ0faa	Sprain might take couple of games. Its wont be a season ending injury|`|sOae9LUzaa	It will probably last only a month, but Bynum will make sure it's season-ending, because he is afraid of Perkins knocking him to the floor like he did with the Pistons.

If she has lost the skills then it won't help to be back in competition she would have to relearn the skills she knew. I wish her luck :)

2iuZdBXraa	It's because their fans are the most obnoxious in the league.  Touch a Habs player on the ice and the fans are screaming for a penalty.  They haven't won a Cup in 15 years but it's all about how many they've won overall with their fans.  Same old tired and cliched lines from Habs fans.  As the joke goes - What does a school Snow Day and a Habs fan have in common?  Answer - no class.|`|lHzBJA4eaa	I hated them all my life up until that conceited idiot Roy left.After that they got a few Leafs and that made them more tolerable,almost human like...

My favourite team is any team playing against the Leafs.  You either like the Leafs or hate them with a passion.    The sentiment for my Habs may be similar but not nearly as bad.  The Leafs win that title hands down (which is the only title they've won since 1967!!)  GO HABS GO!!|`|XQoH9ZI5aa	I can only speak for myself. Living on the Eastern Coast of Canada, everyone (well most) grow up as fans of the Leafs or the Habs (a few Bruins fans...the "odd" Flyers fan etc) and there is the general dislike for the one that you don't cheer for.     As far as TSN (most Canadian Stations), it might as well be called the Toronto Sports Network because they have this love affair with them...locality I guess.     Another theory, they are a bit like the Yankees in that they have won the most championships.....so I don't know if I would call it jealousy but you know what I mean.     The Habs are the team I dislike the most, as a Flyers fan, they have had their battles over the years but my hate stems from their fans....namely my friends who are Habs fans AND one annoying as hell brother in law who is a self proclaimed hockey genius and the Habs can do no wrong.....every game the Habs play, I hope for them to lose just so I don't have to listen to his drivel.     If I have to hear how the Habs have won a cup every decade one more time.....time is running out......let's just hope I don't have to listen to it for another decade.|`|a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	It's called jealousy.    Montreal is the greatest franchise the sport has ever known............and always will be.      Oh wait, they chose not to use territorial protection on me.    Habs suck!

Nuj1eScCaa	He hasn't offically lost his spot on Inside the NBA, but he's probably one big mistake away from it. TNT will keep Barkley on, which I'm glad of because I really like Charles, but they made him take a leave of absence to deal with his legal matters. In reality, they want him off the air until the smoke clears. This undoubtedly is embarrassing to TNT.    I wouldn't be surprised to see him back on the show before the seasons done. He usually does commentary during All-Star weekend, so we may see him then.     The stange thing about this whole thing is, did Charles honestly think the cop was going to let him go because he was in a hurry to get a BJ?

OfNTLq3Qaa	You're giving the WWE creative team way to much credit.|`|0Dm3WEMcaa	the no remorse thing is simply because Matt doesn't feel any for what he did, in his mind he did the right thing because of everything Jeff has done and how mistreated he feels by the fans. just like Jericho it is going to take sometime for matt to truly get over as a heel but i think it is for the best and i don't want to see Edge involved this should just be Hardy Vs.

jhFT5kT1aa	work on your abs  crunches, sit ups, leg lifts.    check this out:)  Well, since you have pretty good jumps, I take it you aren't a beginning cheerleader. I have a few technical tips you may or may not have heard before, as well as some muscle-strengthening exercises that will help to get more height in your jumps.     First of all, make sure that you are sitting completely into your jump. If this is new to you, it may be awkward at first, and you might fall backward when you start trying it. But it will really make your jumps look hyper-extended, even though they are probably around the same height. This would be probably the best advice I could give you to make your jumps appear higher. If you sit into your jumps, they will look much higher.     Another suggestion would be to wear ankle-weights while practicing your jumps. Try doing 10-20 jumps a day with weights on. After practicing with these for a while, your jumps will be higher, and what's more, they will feel much more effortless.     There are also strength-building activities you can use to help improve the height in your jumps. Try doing an exercise called a "V-up" or "Straddle-up". To do this, lay flat on your back with your arms outstretched. Then, use your stomach muscles to fold your body together in the air, and spread your legs like you would in a toetouch. Try to do these quickly, and when you go back down to the ground, try not to let your feet or arms touch the ground again. This will make the exercise more difficult but will also help to build your muscles and make your jumps higher.     You may have heard these tips before, but the best tip I can give you is to practice! You really can get better each time you practice and work on your jumps, and that is the best way to guarantee improvement.|`|vJ9zYnByaa	Stretch more in your legs. Swing your arms. Start on your toes then push off.|`|eLDjiAcQaa	Make your thighs stonger then use your arms in your jumps and push off with your toes!|`|8AbjHfnBaa	well, stretch out you legs really good. like practice your splits and stuff like that. and my 2nd yr cheerin we had a guest coach for a few weeks from maryland twisters and he told us a way to help our jumps get higher is to do a lot of tuck jumps starting like regular jumpd everyday. bcuz the more you practice that and then you do your regular jumps you are jumping higher. i did that alot and it really helped. plus it is also better if you practice it on hard floor instead of cheering floors cause you have to put more effort into it and when you get to the cheer floor its easier and higher.  hope it workss :)|`|cXVslImpaa	I'm working on the same thing you are. :) I find strength and flexibility are the two most important things when you're jumping. Well, firstly, the one thing that made my jumps SOOOOOOO much better was that my coach changed how we do our prep a little bit and it gives you alot more height and makes your jums alot neater, but really you cant change the way you do your jumps unless your team does, so that won't really help I guess.    So, back to what I was saying. Strength and flexibility. Strength will come with time. Try and find some space in your house and just practice jumps over and over again. to work on getting more springy off of your toes, do tuck jumps and get your legs as high as you can. Since your legs are coming down from a height, they will come down harder, but as soon as you hit the ground jump up and do another tuck jump. I would recommend do ten in a row, then take a short break, and do that twice more. Do this maybe once a day...??? That's what I would do, but you can practice it more if you think it will help.     Along with the tuck jumps, of course just work on practicing all of your jumps. Maybe do ten toe touches, but separate, not all together like the tuck jumps. Then ten right herkies, ten left herkies, ten pikes, and another ten toe touches. Again, I would recommend doing this once a day, more if needed.     Do all of your jumps in a wide open space, I would say outside, but that depends where you are - there's a foot of snow outside my house right now :) And preferably try and do them on some sort of carpet in case you fall. I do not know if you have a sprung floor at your gym..??? But whether you do or don't, make sure that all of these jumps you practice at home are NOT on a sprung floor. If every jump you practice is on a sprung floor or trampoline, you begin to rely on it and it will bring down the quality of your jumps. If you practice all of your jumps on a non-sprung floor, when you return to practice, or at competition, you will find that maybe your jumps aren't alot different, but they will surely be easier which is a relief during a long, hard practice.     If you want help specifically with the height of your jumps, believe me, this will help. And if you do practice these excercises EVERY DAY your jumps will be amazing :D and that's what matters.     Okay, there's more. Now, that is what I'd recommend if you don't want to spend a lot of time every day working on them. But if you do have more time, work on strength training. You may not think it will help your jumps, but it DEFINATELY will and it will improve your abilities in all areas of cheerleading. For instance, find a blank wall and do wall sits. If you don't know what that is, read this: Hold your hands out in front of you the whole time, don't rest them on your legs. Have your back straight against the wall, your feet shoulder width apart and AWAY from the wall. slide down the wall until the tops of your legs are flat, and ya aI don't really know how to explain it so ask people at your cheer :P. Maybe hold wall sits for a minute, take a thirty second break, another minute, break and one more minute. The next day, do the same thing with a minute and a half. The day after, two minutes. Once you have reached, i dont know, three minutes?, increasing 30 seconds a day, go back to two minutes thirty seconds, and so on keep going up and down.     There's lots of other strength training you can do, leg excercises especially will help, but work on sit ups, push ups, FIFTY TWO CARD PICKUP IS GOOD FOR SURE, uh, planks, etc. Again, ask people at your cheer, or me :P if you don't know what these are.    OKAY well. Now, I also said flexibility is important. IT IS. Very important. Even if you are super strong you need to be flexible. Sit pn the ground in a toe touch position. Keep your back straight and lean forwards as far as you can, with your arms in the right position and your toes pointed, and your l|`|ZyQFd6NVaa	Cheerleading Crunches: lay on your back on the floor, legs straight out in front of you, arms in a touchdown (up beside your head). Sit up, bringing your legs up and rolling back into a toe touch position (straddle), and bring your arms between to a T. Just think like you're doing a toe touch sitting on the floor. 10-15 is good to start. They hurt, and they look and feel awkward, but they'll help your jumps.   Squat Jumps: crouch down, touching your fingertips to the floor. Jump up, bringing your arms above your head, shrugging up your shoulders like you would doing a jump. As soon as your feet touch the floor, return to the starting position. 20 is a good number to start with, increase gradually.   Consecutive tucks: do a tuck with the approach. As soon as you hit the floor, go back up into a tuck with no prep. 5-10 to start.   Also, try doing 100 jumps every night, 10 of each jump you know: tuck, abstract(double hook), right hurdler, left hurdler. spread eagle, left front hurdler, right front hurdler, right herkie, left herkie, and finally, your toe touch.   Do these in addition to the leg lifts and kicks every day, at least once. Your toe touches, and other jumps will improve tremendously. Make sure you stretch a lot, and use your stomach and shoulders to get the height in your jump, as well as your legs. Do lots of crunches to strengthen your stomach.

I rarely replace things that are usable, preferring to take the time to find something that will stand up and do the job.

Orton wil surely go for Cena.  3. Well i think morrison wil win it coz frm last 2 months wwe is using him too much to give him hype.|`|EA7oEQwMaa	no i wasnt confused.|`|AtJXqxN2aa	No, I idn't think that both titles in one match. I don't even recall hearing that, then again I just lie down on my couch and watch wrestling and don't really care what's going on.     BQ1:I hope Edge holds the title after Wrestlemania. Let's face it there's no one else on Smackdown who is a heel will be better WWE champ.  And who is the face to face Edge. It's most likely Matt vs Jeff, Koslov and HHH are starting something. So I really don't know. Unless........Anyone wanna see Taker win the World chapionship for third year in a row at Wrestlemania? Definitely not me, but you guys might.    BQ2:I think Orton might go after World title since that was his first title. He probably gonan brag about it.  Probably some crap about "I won this 5 years ago and everyone was jealous. HHH is fighting some Russian freak, Batista can't even compete and Ric Flair is out of our lives. Legacy is the future of WWE. It's better than DX, better than The Four Horsemen, and defintely bette than Evolution"    BQ3: No doubt Benjamin gonna be in it This could be a push for him if he wins it. But I really don't see him winnign it. Then agian any of us didn't see Punk winning last year either.Rey Mysterio could possibly be in the match this year. This is one match that no one is sure about. If I had to guess I would say.............hmmmmmm..........John Morisson

They throw everybody over the top flying (when it is the big guys, it is very realistic and very possible).    My all-time favorite elimination move is when somebody is groggy on the ropes and then somebody clotheslines them over. That is the best way to end the Rumble. (Like the way Steve Austin eliminated Kane in 2001)    Another awesome way to end the Rumble was when Shawn Michaels superkicked Diesel over the top rope to win the 1996 Rumble.|`|EA7oEQwMaa	i like the way maria does it

T6nmD3X9aa	1) you need a better attitude. Thinking that you wont go far with either sport is not good, think positive, practice and you can continue playing as long as you want to! There are many grown men who got into college sports by chance, there are many who play just for fun!    2) Why choose? Play both. If it is a scheduling issue, choose the one that you have the most passion for (not what your best at, but what you love playing the most!)    3) As you continue to play regularly, you learn new tricks and plays, new routines, you get stronger, faster, and better.

1b98dcf55f3a990e7013ba04e6691faaaa	Use the mantle climbing technique.      It's the same concept as getting out of a pool without using the ladder.  Begin by grabbing the top of the wall and push with your legs and pull with your arms.  Once you lift high enough, you can then push down with your arms instead of pulling up.  Get a foot on the top of the wall and jump over the wall.  Or just swing your legs over and then drop down the other side.      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_(cli...

ll2y4YIGaa	no the baseball mask has a diff. cage style than the hockey one allowing the possibility of a puck going through the cage. it shouldnt matter how many wheels you have, as long as youve got two and try to keep them as small as possible.|`|axxQzOCHaa	As far as the mask goes = check with the league, as well as USA Hockey Inline if playing in America, or Hockey Canada if playing in Canada.   If you live outside of either of those countries, I'm sure you can get more information online as far as who to get in touch with.     I think that it has sufficient protection (a baseball is harder than a roller hockey puck), but it's up to them if they allow its use or not. Don't be surprised if they don't because you're better off with something approved by CSA and/or HECC    4 wheel goalie skates is what I use.   I have a pair of CCM 755 kevlar reinforced (goalie model) with 4 wheels on each skate.    ** Blade Runner - excellent point about the gap in a baseball / softball catcher masque.

n2O0NwR6aa	Don't feel "weird" that you've decided to do cheerleading.  A LOT of girls who once said, "I'd never be a cheerleader!" end up doing it!  And it surprises everyone - including themselves.  But hey, life is full of surprises!  We all change our minds about things and end up taking a course we never expected.  That's what life is all about - trying new things, changing and growing.  And moving to a new place is a great time to make changes.    And by the way, you can be a cheerleader and still be a girl who doesn't care what people say about you. You're still the same person inside - you just happen to be doing cheer!  But there's nothing wrong with wanting to look nice, or caring what people think of you.  There's not a person alive who doesn't want to be liked and accepted.  Joining a cheer team will help you meet people and make friends, and yes, even boost your popularity.  If that's part of the reason you want to do it, that's okay!      But to answer your question: cheerleading down south is a pretty big deal.  There are lots of girls who've been doing it practically since birth.  So if you want to catch up and have a chance of making the team, you'll have to start working hard, right away!  Here are some things to work on:    Jumps: There are three main jumps in cheerleading - the toe touch, pike jump, and front hurdler. You can search the web to see what they look like, but it's important to learn them correctly. The judges will be looking at your form, not just how high you can jump. Sign up for a cheer class or clinic, or take a couple private lessons, so you can learn the proper technique from an expert. Then go home and practice, practice, practice!    Tumbling: Most schools don't require tumbling skills, but the girls who can tumble will score higher. So start RIGHT NOW with some tumbling classes, and keep them up until tryouts. You may be able to learn a back handspring by tryout time - and that will help your score a lot. The more often you go, the faster you'll progress... so go more than once a week if you can! You can also get some extra practice by attending open gyms, and taking private lessons.    Motions: You'll probably be taught a cheer to perform at tryouts, and you'll be judged on how sharp and tight your motions are. See if you can learn a cheer ahead of time - any cheer, it doesn't matter - and practice at home in front of a mirror. Watch to make sure you're hitting each position precisely, with straight arms and quick, sharp motions. Taking a dance class can also help a lot!    Voice Projection: Cheerleaders need to be loud - but not screechy. When you shout your cheer, yell from your diaphram and make your voice deep, sharp and clear. This sounds easy, but it takes some practice to get it right. And when you're jumping around in a cheer and yelling at the same time, it's easy to become breathless and lose your voice! So start "training" your voice by yelling a chant or cheer while you're doing something active - jumping jacks, jogging in place, etc.     Spiriting: You'll probably be expected to do some spiriting when you try out. That's when you jump around and yell things like "Alright! Let's go Eagles! Fire it up!" while doing some simple arm motions. If you're not used to doing that, it can feel pretty weird... and you might not know exactly what to do or say. So go to a game, watch the cheerleaders, and see what they do. Make a note of some of the things they say, and what they do with their arms. Then go home and practice in front of your mirror. Make up a little "spiriting routine" that you can practice, so it will become more natural for you.    Smile: The number one tip people give for cheer tryouts is to SMILE! Sounds simple enough, but it's easy to forget when you're out there concentrating on your jumps or cheer. So start working on it now. Whenever you practice anything - jumps, cheers, etc - do it with a smile. That way it will become a habit, and you won't have to concentrate on smiling when you're out there in front of the judges.     To get an idea of what the judges are looking for, here's a typical score sheet that many schools use:    Entrance/Smile - 5 pts  Crowd appeal (neat, pleasant appearance) - 5 pts  Spirit (being peppy) - 5 pts  Voice Projection (being loud but not screechy) - 5 pts  Motions (being sharp) - 10 pts  Memory/Recall (ability to learn the cheer) - 10 pts  Jumps (height and technique) - 15 pts  Tumbling (difficulty and form) - 10-15 pts  Dance ability - 5-10 pts  Grades - 10 pts  Citizenship - 20 pts  Total Possible points - 100 pts    Oh, one more thing.  A lot of schools hold their cheer tryouts in the spring, so the new squad can go to camp, practice over the summer and prepare for the fall season.  If you miss tryouts for next school year, just keep on working and tryout the following spring!  You'll have even more time to prepare!    I hope this helps some! Good luck!|`|ZyQFd6NVaa	Step1   Show those pearly whites! Cheerleaders should always SMILE during a game or performance. Look like you are having fun (even if youre not). Look like you're proud of your team and your school(even if they're losing the tenth straight game in a row). People are watching you at every moment. You want them to think you're having the time of your life.   Step2   Pay attention to the game. (Is your team offense or defense? Are you winning or losing? Who has the ball?) The game should effect how you cheer and what you say. Few things look worst than a cheerleader cheering offense when her team is DEFENSE or vice versa. You should know at least a little about the sport you are cheering for!   Step3   Ask questions BEFORE you go out to perform. Pay attention to what your cheerleading team is doing and what they are planning to do. Keep an eye on your captains. Dont wait until the last minute before a stunt or performance to ask questions. Walking out to perform is not the time to ask What are we doing!? or Where do I go!?   Step4   Don't freeze up or make a big deal out of a mess-up. Just keep going. If you make a mistake, dont draw more attention to yourself. Do NOT stop in the middle and tell your neighbor; do NOT double over laughing; just keep going. Ive seen many cheerleaders do this and it isnt attractive or cute. If you mess up, chances are not many people noticed. Mistakes are inevitable, its how you react to your mistake that is important.   Step5   Stay in your formation. If you are standing on the sidelines or side court, dont EVER walk to another position to talk to a friend. Stay in line.   Cheerleaders are supposed to be cheering on the team, not carrying on a conversation amongst each other. Its Ok to look like youre having fun, you can even chat about the game with the cheerleader next to you- but this isnt the time to talk about boyfriends and what you did last weekend.   Step6   Do one stunt, one tumbling pass, or one toe touch. During halftime, most cheerleading squads go to meet the opposing squad. Most teams even introduce the opponent's cheerleaders to their own crowds. They may partner up, make a brief introduction (your name and year), and then you are supposed to do some skill: a tumble pass, a jump, or a partner stunt. Dont be a showoff, if you can do ten toe touches in a row that is great, but dont do it during intros.   Step7  Pracitce Rules:  1. Pay attention- the coach or faculty advisor is taking HER afternoon so you can practice and look good. Get with it or get out! If one person acts silly, it hinders the rest of the team's concentration. In cheerleading, someone (or several people) could get physically and severely hurt if you fail to pay attention.    2. If you don't understand the routine or stunt, ask BEFORE attempting it.     3. If you are honestly not comfortable executing a stunt, tell the captain or coach.     4. NEVER stunt or tumble without mats and a coach/spot/responsibile adult present.    5. Don't miss practice, one missing person can hold the entire team back from praticing a routine|`|jhFT5kT1aa	down south? lol    get into tumbling  get round off back handspring  do hair daily(like down or curly or different styles)  be peppy and happy|`|X7IsNqI7aa	how south r u going?  like what state?      stretch stretch stretch!  you can find many different stretches online.  you need to stretch every day!  coaches want flexible girls. try getting into the splits every day and if you cant go all the way down hold yourself up on your arms.    EXERCISE!  run, do pushups, do situps, jumping jacks, squats, frog jumps, banana jumps,hollow rocks, arch rocks. anything you can think of. for any cheer routine you need STAMINA and ENDURANCE. exercise will help a lot. you can also find many of these online =]    PRACTICE =]  smile in a mirror, learn a cheer dance off of youtube, practice cheer motions. any of these will help.    good luck =]
EiPdBAaeaa	Damn I still can't believe it!! That sucx especially cuz they  play the celtics n cavs next week!|`|4rURc0roaa	Good news for Knicks fans since we have the Lakers next.|`|uaGAljuIaa	Stupid Weenie Got Hurt Again.|`|uxregJ0faa	Im pissed he was on a rampage. He was about to own the Cavs Big Z and Celtics Perkins.|`|3teWTOPqaa	I am pissed off right now.|`|2dgVkcVAaa	i'm not  you lakers fans make me lol @ you guys.      You still have Kobe?Right?  Until he's injured then you could be pissed all you want.|`|sOae9LUzaa	Well, I'm mad only because his injury might be used as an excuse by some Fakers out there for Lakers if they lose any games. This means the team that beats the Lakers get almost no credibility for their win because "Bynum wasn't there", which really is not fair.|`|BIyJUmM9aa	I think all Laker fans are mad.  They should be, this has happend twice to Bynum, and he ws really doing well lately  I hope he is ok!|`|wKGZ0h8Paa	The only thing that bother me about Bynum's fake injury is that sll Fakers will now have an excuse when Boston slaughter Lakers again in the Final.|`|C0KwC6DBaa	I am mad too!|`|4DcvpQXfaa	MC and another lakers fan!|`|L0ft1eo7aa	i mad lets hope its minor|`|KOfwamdbaa	He is injured.. Since when?|`|iVHfNbAMaa	Meee fo sure  cuz he just came bak from it and when lakers go into playoffs they need him big time|`|kmBdx2koaa	im glad cause im a magics fan but i think lakers will be fine.|`|2ZcEepyAaa	I'm lovin it. But in another way, im mad. This just gives the Laker fans a reason to say why they are doing so bad or why they wont win the NBA finals or why they wont make the playoffs. You have to admit, all fans do it. Hey, i would do it if KG got injured or Paul Pierce or Ray Allen. I just hate the people who just keep on coming up with reasons why they didnt win. Which sadley to say, is almost always laker fans.
Gh7vs777aa	my answer is try to look on ebay store.com|`|RdhCN6ZXaa	go to the team store
2ZcEepyAaa	I would go with the Athletic tights if i were you. They look better than the high socks in my opinion and it makes you guys look better. I dont know why but it just gives you that look. Meaning a good basketball look. Like that your good. I mean, whenever i see a player wearing these things in my high school bball league, i always expect that they are good. It just gives you that look. So go with the Athletic tights.
13XU8cCKaa	Man I see you a lot and I love answering your questions because they are about the Knicks.  I think that he should replace Pierce on the All-Star team.  He is the best player on the Knicks in my opinion.  He has improved his jump shot.  Lee is producing like Dwight Howard.  He is undersized for the Center position but has been embarrasing those big centers like Perkins, Jeff Foster, and Shaq.  Watch out David Lee is becoming his own.|`|4DcvpQXfaa	yes he's underrated and i prefer him in ALL STAR instead lewis!    undersized for his position but has high FG%?    RARE!|`|uFqkgwhQaa	and there are rumors that Knicks might trade Lee due to the fact he will be worth alot after this season.    I really really hope Knicks will make a right move and do  not trade Lee.    Knicks are in a great push for the 7th and 8th spot of the standing.  And Dream Week is coming up and if Knicks put up numbers and played splendid Defense, they should be fine.    But yes David Lee is really a Awesome player and any team will want him.    Go Knicks!|`|N3AiQRJFaa	Yea he is really good and if Knicks can get a big superstar like Wade or Chris Bosh or any who is really good. They can get a championship. There are going to be many free agents in 2009 and 2010. I doubt LeBron will leave Cavs but they might be able to get Bosh. also Chris Bosh need to come to new york so he can get recognized for his talent. Knicks should never trade David Lee.|`|dDhTMacAaa	A steal in the draft after a promising career at the University of Florida. He is a big rebounder inside and a physical defender on the other end. He has a soft touch around the basket, too- which has given him the scoring numbers to go with excellent rebounding numbers.|`|uJB8ZCCraa	He's a great player that will be very effective for years to any team in need of a big man. It's a shame that New York will depart with him just so they might have a better chance of landing Lebron. I hope David Lee stays on the Knicks because they would probably not be where they are right now.|`|qp7SRGrcaa	i think he is the future of new york. and he will do more for them than some starbury ever could! he dose i don't however think he should start over k.g or cb4 at the all star game! but the best thing to me, about lee is, he can only get better! now if new york can get a good small forward they could compete for a decent play off spot.|`|hzttr76Maa	He is an underrated center, and a rebounding and scoring machine. He's excelled in Mike D'Antoni's system, and he only has room for improvement.
E70A7aqcaa	Not I, and for the very reason that you're asking your question, not just out of him but from more players than make it worth even thinking of watching them, or the NFL and others.  God Bless you.
XrCc85kNaa	It is a knee sprain....  He will probably come back in a couple of weeks...    The definition of "pulling a Paulie" is:  Faking an injury, crying like a baby, going to the locker room on a wheelchair and then coming back after 1 minute.....|`|VJ1Gsr0Xaa	"sprained right knee". lets hope it is not that serious and he is 100% after the allstar break. but plz, dont compare bynum to that female pierce. that guy is a bum.|`|zoDEqv6Zaa	Yep, they put him on a wheel chair and injury seem to be serious. But that didn't happen because they were playing in Memphis.|`|F1xpcJ2Laa	YS...lol....|`|ZAh8CEoGaa	It was  agreen wheelchair with " Wheelchair Club Only" printed in the back of the seat.|`|jcmTCmfqaa	Haha it was not at Staples Center|`|u1fK5CuNaa	Sprained his knee. Hope he's okay.|`|uxregJ0faa	At least he didnt go out like this  http://lakers.freedomblogging.com/files/...    Bynum will be back.
tYwSQQKTaa	Pittsburgh because their defense is just too strong for Arizona's offense. They haven't faced a defense like that yet thise season so it might surprise them. The Cardinals will keep it close though because i don't think the Steelers will Stop Fitzgerald. steelers 31-24|`|SJ8gNEWuaa	Pittsburgh.  and about like by 14 to 10 points.  you have my word.|`|Ilfa6WNraa	I think the Pittsburgh is going to win because of their experience. But Cardinals have the heart. I think Pittsburgh will win by one touch down.|`|CHZaXrOZaa	It will be a blow out! Steelers will win by at least 7 points. If I am wrong you can email me and taunt me. But my money is on Pittsburg.|`|JsnBTipMaa	Lets see AZ win and lose the same old, same old.|`|UAHjJpC0aa	hey "mo-ha-med"  quit spamming/trolling us    just go away      al right?????

The team and the fans know they deserve this more than any other team out there. First time in history to win a superbowl and they team will make sure they get this one.     Arizona will make a better and historical super bowl if they win it. Sqeelers will be a normal boring win.|`|ADpigO0Laa	WATCH OUT FOR THIS GUY  d9t7edx4|`|B1ueclBaaa	The Burgh... Just watch the Steel Curtain drop and D-Fence kick in (or their butts...).....  I'd say by at least 6 pts.

RGQwYDReaa	He took Bonnar down at will, was the better striker, and was really dynamic.  I agree, his cardio by the third round was one of his holes.  Looking forward to seeing more of him in fights to come!|`|a12e9c4a58e03ac9e62bf16080e6af25aa	jones just worked bonner. lets see if jones can handle forrest
zBbleB8Zaa	Well first off, John Morrison has the looks. Although I am a boy, I really wished I look liked him, even though its make-up. Just to get that clear.    Secondly, I think he is a great wrestler, versatile and such. He is mid-carder material as a singles wrestler and a great addition to any tag-team he was involved in. Both MNM and Miz + Morrison have held the tag-team championships.    Third off, I think WWE uses him extremly well and to his potential.|`|3k4tPNTGaa	m already watchin morisson as future champion. Waitin for the day when he split up with miz and chase his dream. I know miz gt gud mic skills also nd if he improve more on wrestling dn he cud b there too.|`|94UNuQ4Faa	For one, he is HOT! . He has great mic skills and has really god skill in the ring!! =]]|`|AA11482019	I think he could be a main eventer in a couple years if he would dump that idiot MIz.|`|4tvI9WYjaa	well people going to give me thumbs down ha ha  but i think he is very good in the ring good mic skill's he push is coming for the wwe championship|`|UzEAVZ6Aaa	This guy is oozing with talent and will one day, very soon, be headlining Wrestlemania.  Book It Now!|`|G9LSZQcaaa	I think hes not that good of a wrestler, He was WWE tag team champion for 7 months when it should of been 3 months.|`|smcDn76jaa	AN extremely talented young man that has a great future ahead of him. He will probably win the MITB this year, and hopefully have a feud with HBK.|`|ElSYCkQDaa	I think John Morrison is alright because their are better people than him|`|KwcVoeXCaa	I think he has everything that a wrestler needs....looks/ability and skill..........great wrestler|`|ONuy5vniaa	Skilled wrestler with good mic skills and ring presence.    He will have a great future at the rate he is going.|`|k1OZmMPFaa	mis used talent|`|1li4vbVoaa	Never heard of him.|`|qypwWxuVaa	i think john morrison is the next big thing he has the look the character the talent practically everything give him a couple of years and he'll b headlining PPVs and have many world title reigns|`|6n63DKYWaa	he is the future|`|BglekVnQaa	I think he sucks and the only fans he has is horny teenage fangirls who thinks he's beautiful and he's hella ugly.|`|bMjKQ6xCaa	I think he is pretty good at what he does. In my opinion that is.|`|M0PowAryaa	i have to say his athlete skill  are good|`|aUcn8Sqxaa	i think that wwe could do something better with him then just being with the miz
S0u3HKzhaa	I kind of feel bad for him,really he wasn't that bad,it's the wwe's fault for having such a terrible gimmick for him.I think if given another chance they should drop the gimmick.Maybe turn heel?But I don't know when I assume sometime in February.|`|i1YnDdcLaa	ON FEBRUARY 30, 2009|`|OUU40utJaa	I actually have a good story line for him. Kizarny and Khali should team up. That way Khali doesn't have to wrestle as much. Their stable name could be the sideshow freaks.|`|s6yua5oxaa	I read somewhere that Kizarny had sucky reactions and even a few you can't wrestle chants,and his match against MVP didn't go over to well with the fans,so I honestly wouldn't be surprised is he was released soon.      Edit:I really like the gimmick,and I wish he would be able to get a better reaction,because I don't want to see him get released,as he might be able to make a name for himself and be known worldwide
b492423af2d29fe3c720b5001a69bd89aa	I root for my team to beat the other team but I never wish for someone to get injured ........like you said I want my squad to beat the celtics -cavs-magic-hornets-jazz and spurs when their at 100% .......lakers are my team but im a fan of the game and I enjoy watching great players through out the nba but I never wish for anyone to get hurt.|`|2kgTdNRQaa	I am a Lakers fan and I don't fit any of your description.|`|3teWTOPqaa	Lakers played well w/o Bynum last year, but against a phyical team like the Celtics/Cavs we need Andrew in the middle more than Gasol. I don't think this injury is anywhere near a season ending one, but I really hope Bynum can come back after 2 weeks max, cuz we need to get homecourt in the Finals.|`|ZOXoPgJbaa	omg hes injured??? Oh NO! :(|`|EKF2HdZKaa	thank goodness someone brings order to this chaos.....|`|vFbzBo4eaa	I agree I'n not a Laker or a Celtic fan but you have point.If the Celticks din't have KG,they wouldm't be so good same means for the Lakers,Bynum is their defense,he means them a lot and he has to come back before the playoffs.|`|JYoQdgKbaa	True..........................plus GO CARDS|`|EiPdBAaeaa	Damn it sucx, still can't believe he got injured again! He was on a roll the last few games but I think he will be back in a few weeks!!

a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	Renew    There have been rumours circulating the last 2-3 days that the Coyotes will be sold very soon to another Phoenix area business man on the condition that the lease is re-negotiated.|`|9GzkVwfGaa	Renew them.  I thought that the Coyotes were going to destroy the Ducks and the Stars?|`|qaHM2mIlaa	Watch if you don't renew them, they will make it into the playoffs next year.|`|hQA6ZLjLaa	Nothing Personal here but I say don't renew them Winnipeg needs their team back|`|AA12089021	I could not disagree any more.    The Yotes are tied for the 6 seed in the west.  (They do have more games played than anyone they are tied with.)  They have one of the best crops of young talent in the NHL right now, I would put them behind the Blackhawks in that department.    They are 1-4 in their last 5 games.  That is called a slump; nothing more, nothing less.  They are going to come around.  Looking at their schedule, I predict them winning 7 or 8 games out of the 12 they have scheduled in February.|`|NrbLdZzOaa	The Sabres are on fire, dont worry about tonight.|`|j1KzL7RBaa	listen man.. i would CHERISH nhl season tickets. i live in montreal, and its hard enough to get to one game a season, let alone even dream about season tickets. hold on to them, the teams not going to fold anytime soon, and they have some good young players.|`|ll2y4YIGaa	do  what you want.   and by the way, the cardinals dont win on skill,   they win on luck and bein in the right place at the   right time    edit: by the way im going for the cards in the superbowl. so dont think im some hater of AZ or anything like that.|`|ViB84hYzaa	Howler turning into a fair-weather fan?   As you see here, there are plenty of people who would die for season tickets more for the love of the game not to mention to continue to support their team and see the other teams and stars.  Remember the Coyotes are climbing the ladder of success, so it will continue to take time to improve. Why not hang in there and keep the tickets so you can continue to see the Yotes improve and finally make it to glory. Wouldn't it be nice to say that you where there for most of it?  Keep your tickets regardless, (you can always try to sell some if you don't want to go etc) unless of course the Yotes start to lose all their games and you just can't seem to muster garner the strength to go to the rink). You don't want to miss out on something so special when the time happens.    As for the Cardinals, the team seems to win the games they need to. Unfortunately that streak of luck ends today!|`|fB4RfiCgaa	Give it a couple more years. They have a good core of young players and they still have a shot at the playoffs though they probably won't go far. Besides, do you really want to drive to LA to see a game?|`|axxQzOCHaa	That's up to you but I do like the way the Coyotes have played throughout the season and believe they will be back on track soon enough.    Fortunately my local CHL team only has 32 regular season home games, and a lot of the people I play hockey with sit in the same section (centre ice and between 5 and 10 rows up) so with the group rate it wouldn't be more than a $ 600 / season investment.     I have also been extremely lucky that last year one of them always seemed to have an extra ticket for me. (or an un-used one that I could redeem for one to that night's game)    This season, I had ordered a Stars hoodie from Hockey Giant but it was a bit big on me but luck struck again, as a friend of mine who works for the team unexpectedly gave me a ticket for each remaining home game (about 20 at that point) PLUS playoffs for it.     I know it's not NHL but it's still hockey. And living so close to Mexico, that means a lot to me. (though I do like to inform out-of-state friends that hockey is the fastest-growing participant sport south of the Rio Grande, or Rio Bravo as Spanish-speakers call it)    ps. As the brother of a die-hard Nordiques fan, I can relate to cdn24fan's insight very well|`|WnQ3fhVhaa	It is not over yet Howler. I was a Panthers ticket holder for eight years we only went to the play offs once while I was a ticket holder. I was a full season ticket holder when we sucked . So stick it out. If finances improve I may take another shot since most of the ticket office that screwed up my tickets is long gone now . The season isn't over yet. But I know the teams are already asking for renewals . I know the Panthers are .|`|lYnkvRASaa	Don't give up on them yet.  The have some great young players.  Renew the tickets, if enough of you do so the will stay. (at least long enough to be competitive)  You don't want to be the Nordiques- leave and when the cup right away.  Plus in today's economic climate it is not so easy to move a team.|`|oJsrGmmPaa	You need to question your inner fanhood to make that decision. No one here can give you a definite answer. If I were to question my fanhood, it would be based on two factors:    1) How much of a hockey fan I am. As a hockey fan, I would renew my season tickets. I'm sure there is somebody who would be willing to buy them off you if you can't make certain games.    2) How much of a Coyotes fan I am. I'm not, and I'm not going to answer this part because it's so much more complicated as a Leafs fan. But IF the Leafs were in the Coyotes' position, I would definitely renew in show of support and fanhood.    You can question my manhood all you want, but only question my fanhood if you want to die.
qZnenOvhaa	Ah! Ah!    The moral is, don't talk **** about fighter before you're fight them. BJ is a skilled fighter but very arrogant. He surely hasn't face the competition that St Pierre has faced, but as always, he was very disrespectful in his interview. Well, I'm glad that someone made him swallow his words.|`|AA11517536	I thought it was great!  I was rooting for GSP, but I thought the fight was going to be a little closer than it was.  I was a little surprised at how weak Penn looked.    I'm happy with the outcome though.|`|I6T4mDPsaa	In my honest opinion , it was so unfair for BJ|`|R0J1W3BCaa	GSP is just a better fighter period. He couldn't knockout BJ but he pummeled him which is worse FOR THE WHOLE FIGHT. That beating was just as bad as the one Matt Hughes gave him. I was surprised at how hard it was for GSP to take him down at first with all BJ's worm like movement.|`|4JQUUrX1aa	im extremely happy with the result.... bj penn the biggest mouth quit.. now lets see if hes going to talk garbage when people interview him like he always does|`|f9soMMuiaa	GSP utilized his reach and weight advantage as his fullest by the long striking, take downs, ground control and then the Ground pound. Hence he won. Penn was in a physical disadvantage stepping into the fight. And I was suprised Penn was so conservative on the stand up in the first round, thus allowing GSP's game plan initiate and fire. I guess one shouldn't have talked too much trash and have such great arrogance when you're stepping into another weight class to face the best.|`|u93eagkqaa	GSP is just way too big for BJ... If GSP goes up in weight and fights Anderson Silva we probably get the same result.    GSP had a good game plan and stuck to it.|`|LanxzmVdaa	gsp won,hes more skilled then BJ.  hes got tried like expected after round 2.|`|d611b36ae65f7ea8baefa388c9d69b77aa	Well this fight is over.

U7BkuEU9aa	I didn't watch the match either, but someone said that he did that after the point...probably he was about to serve, the umpire called for a break and he just used his head to toss the ball before going to his chair in the sidelines.|`|gWLhIoIiaa	Back in 1221 when tennis was invented, players would actually volley the ball back and forth using their heads. And the "ball" was actually a rock. The game evolved into usage of racquets when humans discovered that hands were useful for holding things. Up until then, they were trying to hold the racquets with their mouths. But the rule of using headers was never abolished and to this day is still a legal -- though not well-known -- maneuver. Players very seldom if ever do it now because hitting the ball with a racquet is a much more efficient method. So when Roger did it, it was well within the rules.    The last time a point was won with a header was in 1886 when Abraham Lincoln did it against George Washington in a match for the ages. Abraham was up a break in the 5th set, and was serving with an ad. He had just volleyed back a blistering forehand from George with such an angle that George was in no position to get back into play. In fact, he dove headlong into the crowd -- where he met his soon-to-be wife Martha -- while taking a stab at the ball. Amazingly, he got it back into play. Abraham, realizing the situation and being the arrogant showoff that he is, took off his stove pipe hat and headed the ball into George's court, thus winning the point.    Interesting note: George was paralyzed from the neck down due to that incident, and was painted as a standing person with useful limbs because at the time our forefathers did not think later generations would accept a quadriplegic president. But George's amazing friends Ben Franklin and Thomas Edison eventually invented and outfitted him with robotic arms and legs not more than a year later! So George's "wheelchair year" was all but forgotten about and written out of most history books.|`|39cbcb3803017f914854d7e536ef56e5aa	the ball can not touch the persons body and no body part can hit the ball back

1uLfl0sXaa	In two half decades of cricket watching this is the most bizarre incident I have seen.  Zaheer is not a slow bowler and imagine a ball hurled at 140kms crashing in to the stumps and the bails not falling; if that was freakish, what about the run out attempt?  Was there a conspiracy?

s9Pwnb87aa	The NFL should just let the Browns and Raiders play each other in the Super Bowl----screw the NFC.|`|2VGbJtnCaa	I am suprised he has not sued the NFL to make them just give him another trophy!|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	LOL The real sufferers are the Raider fans who have been tortured by watching 'raider nation' go further and further down the toilet. Maybe they should sue Al Davis for malpractice.|`|RS3fjNboaa	I don't know, buddy. But Jenn's answer gave me a pretty good chuckle.|`|bfeQ3miMaa	I think Al Davis has sued the league over one issue or another for the last 20 years.  The reason the Raiders are struggling to get back to the Super Bowl is because Al Davis is terrible to work with and still believes that his philosophies that worked throughout the 70's and into the 80's can work in today's NFL.|`|BlgZmV6uaa	Lets see if I get this right.Your blaming the NFL for the repeated failures of a senile old man. WOW! It has nothing to do with the fact that he trades a high draft pick for Randy Moss and doesn't do anything to hellp him be the playmaker he was with the Vikings.Then gives him away to New England where he is performing at a high level again.                                                                                             Letting Charles Woodson go with no compensation!Packers snapped him up and makes Big Al look stupid again.Head coaches who have no say in who thier asst coaches are.Yet they are required to take all the blame when the team fails.Yeah Big Al sits there with his little blankie sleeping during the games.He runs the team in his sleep and your wondering if the NFL has a grudge against him.|`|WaaFCtuOaa	It's not that the NFL won't allow the Raiders to win another SB, it's because they don't know how to win more games than they lose.  Raiders used to be a powerful team that intimidated opponents but that was like back in the 70's & 80's|`|XLXncQu9aa	It has nothing to do with the NFL.  The Raiders just don't know how to win games and their owner is a major reason why they are so bad.  He's fired just about every coach that he hired.  He's a cancer to that franchise and until he steps down, and they get a coach that is capable they won't win or come close to the super bowl again.|`|S71lfad2aa	The only time the Raiders got screwed was when they had the patriots and called Brady's pass a forward pass when it was a fumble.  other than that it's just been bad luck.

xWApXu8Aaa	You can get the rifles easy enough, but you can't get the darts or the drugs used in them without the proper credentials.  You would also need the proper training as to what the drug dosage would be for a particular species and weight of the animal.|`|X2ZsYRNWaa	The drugs are strictly controlled and only available by prescription.  No doctor or vet will write you one without a good reason.  The guns are just airguns.|`|cR7Sf4cjaa	You can buy the gun and darts - but - you will need to be a state biologist or a Vet to get the drugs that make them work.    Biologist have to take a 3 week course to learn how to use a tranq gun.  There is more to it than you would think.  The dose is determined by weight temperature, and similar sized animals have totally different absorbation rates.  Get it wrong and animals die.    In Alaska last year the dept of Fish and Game saw 40 caribou that were hanging around a dangerous avalanche area.  They darted them all, spent big $$ to fly them out by helicopter - and every single one of them died from overdose.  Not cool.

I then wear my running leggings in the winter and shorts in the summer. And in the winter i put on a jumper i got from a xcountry race.

The Rock was responsible for putting other wrestlers over and helping their careers out even if it meant him losing. I like that about him. For instance, he lost twice to Chris Jericho but those losses solidified Jericho as a A-list superstar in wrestling. Without those wins Jericho would still be stuck at mid-card status. His lost twice to Steve Austin in Wrestlemania and this came at a time when Austin needed a boost for his career. He lost to Triple H for the WWF World title on more than more one occasion which helped spark Triple H's wrestling career. He was a selfless worker.    Austin, on the other hand, was selfish and was notorious for refusing to "job" to certain wrestlers. He did not want to job to Jeff Jarrett because Jeff, he felt, was not in his league. He refused to help Brock Lesnar's career when Lesnar was an up-and-coming rookie in the WWF and he really needed a boost for his career.

UcHqXPpvaa	http://games.espn.go.com/nba/features/tr...    Chicago: Loses a lot of great role players and guys they have coveted a lot. However, gains the thing they absolutely lack and so sorely need. A big time post threat to pair with Derrick Rose. Stoudamire says he wants to be the premier guy, well he and D-Rose will be the premier players in Chicago for years to come, and likely win some championships. They also get a young center prospect and lose a guard from their guard glut.    Milwaukee: They've been shopping Villinueva to avoid giving him a contract extension at the end of the season and have been disappointed in Alexander thus far. With Redd out, they need a solid shooting guard to step in for the remainder of the season. Barbosa is fully capable of doing this, and can step into his perfect role of 6th man when Redd returns. They also get a young and very solid backup center to Bogut.    Phoenix: This trade helps them now and in the future. Stoudamire has been asking for a trade, so they may as well get something in return. Of the 5 players they get, 4 are under the age of 25, and at least 4 are ready to contribute immediately. Villinueva proves to be a competent replacement for Stoudamire, Gordon is an upgrade to Barbosa and the perfect 6th man for Phoenix. Nocioni and Alexander allow the Suns to get younger and better at the sf and pf spots. They can let go of aging Matt Barnes and Grant Hill after the season, and come away with a player of the present and perfect first forward off the bench in Nocioni, and a definite starting sf of the future in Alexander. Joakim Noah will also be a perfect f/c off the bench to complement a pg like Steve Nash, and can eventually be a defensive beast. The Suns get deeper, younger, and can save some money after this season with this trade.|`|qJaM0AY8aa	idk, but they need to move Heinrich, hughs, and noah in a trade for a post player.  all bulls are expandible now except rose and maybe gordon (unless get a really good offer) maybe try for emeka okefor or someone|`|D6Llh23Baa	they will trade for expiring contracts, like lafrentz's bloated contract (they can trade gooden, hughes, noah or gordon) then get boozer this offseason.
uzNm9KtYaa	Your .22 Hornet is a sweet little cartridge, to be sure, and makes a pretty good choice for the small game animals.  However, you will want to remember that the coyotes are on the high side of the small game list.  They take a bit more punch to knock out than a fox, woodchuck,  or raccoon.  The Hornet may have a pretty good sting to it, but if you don't hit the vitals, that's ALL it will have.  Only good shot placement will drop a coyote where it stands.  From your description of the situation, I would go to my local sport shop and pick out a good varmint call.  There are at least three or four that work well.  (I use Circe, Stewart, etc.)  The one to pick for your region will be the one that sounds like an injured rabbit....either jackrabbit or cottontail.  If they have one, check into also getting a cassette tape with instructions on how to best use that call.  Johnny Stewart offers one of those also.  It will be invaluable to you to teach you how to call, as well as when and where.  Calling is easy if you remember a few pointers.  Rabbits have much smaller lungs than we do, so don't make long, drawn out shrieks and screams from your full lungs of air.  The coyotes are smart enough to pick out the phony differences right off.  Keep your calls short and brief.  But remember that you are imitating an animal in shock and pain.  Sound like it.  Call a few times for about 15 to 20 seconds and then wait.  (Repeat the call series after pauses of 10 to 15 minutes.)  Any coyote within half a mile or more of you will be on the way.  They "usually" come in pretty fast, but there will be exceptions if they get suspiscious.  If they stand off at a distance yipping and barking at you, give it up and relocate.  They are on to you.  Otherwise, they will come in very quiet.  Even though you may be calling coyotes, you can also expect fox, bobcats, and other meat-eating critters to come to your call, so be ready.  Don't be surprised if you also get visited by hawks and owls that can drop by unexpected and without your knowing until they fly off with your hat.  Doe deer also come in to the calls because the calls sometimes sound much like the bleating cry of injured fawns.  If nothing responds to your calling, move on down the road a few miles or so and try it again.  Some of the pro's claim they get response from about 30% of their tries.  If I were on your hunt, I would be looking for an island of brush or other cover in a clearing or pasture where I could have good visibility all around me.  Lacking that, I would try to find cover behind me located in such a way that I could be fairly certain of the direction the coyotes would come in to my calling.  I ALWAYS wear camo, and I do prefer cover-up scents as well.  I include a camo-net face cover as a part of my concealment strategy because it is easier to remove than camo-colored face paints if I decide to stop in at the local truck stop for a breakfast of bacon and eggs after a night of hard and hungry hunting.  I use a light and the better and brighter the beam, the better I like it.  With a red cover over the lense, the coyotes (which do not see red) will be less apt to see the light and panic.  The light will show me where their eyes are enough to put my crosshairs where they will do the job best.  Then it's just a matter of holding solid, squeezing off the shot, and taking a coyote pelt to the fur buyers.  Before you do ANY of this, check the game laws in your neck of the woods and be sure that you can follow my advice without violating any regulations.  Some areas do not allow hunting with lights and high-power rifles.  If not, you are limited to sunrise and sunset hours.  I'd start about 4 or 5 in the afternoon and hunt until low light makes the sights unseen.  Start your morning hunt just as the sunlight is slivering the horizon.  Hunt for the next two or three hours.  By then, you will know if your methods have been productive.  Most dedicated varmint hunters will agree that the most productive times when the coyotes are the MOST active are from the times I just described and up til about 11:00 pm at night and again from about 2 or so in the AM until just after full light.  The predators  have a lull time in the middle of the night, and during the day they can be found curled up on some sunny and southern facing slope slumbering away the day in preparation for another night of hunting.  To be successful, you'll follow the same schedule when it comes to bagging and tagging these wily canines.  In essence, the BEST time to hunt the hunters is when the hunters hunt!  Good luck and good shooting.|`|hoZnJVXXaa	You have all the answers you need already listed, I would just like to suggest a website for varmint hunters.<br>  <br>  Varminthunters.com<br>  <br>  They are dedicated to hunting coyotes.  Lots of useful information,  good luck getting out there and trying it.  A little advise.....it is addicting.|`|BTFFpdeOaa	Check out Varmint Al's hunting page.It has a lot of great information on coyote hunting,and you can download calls to a MP3 !<br>  Good Luck !!!|`|vSuWyrFTaa	Guy as you've seen you have some good advice here. I too love to hunt varmits; of these the coyote is the most challenging and elusive. Here in Texas we can spot light varmits and feral animals at night. I'll bait an area with left over trimmings from the butcher, tuna in the can with holes punched in it, and left over table scraps. I've also used regular dog food it doesn't give off as good a scent as the others. A good spot light and some #2 shot with a good 12 ga auto makes quick work of a pack of coyotes.<br>  <br>    One other time of the day I have found that works is between 9am and noon. If a pack goes out hunting and can't make a kill or find a dead animal then they'll go back out to hunt in the morning. This is especially true if they have young pups just getting weaned off a female. I've taken several females this way and some younger males. Several times after taking a few females I've found the dens later with dead pups in it, yes they starved, and some find that harsh; but I'm hunting varmits to protect livestock and family pets. <br>  <br>   Lastly, let me recommend that you get a video named Calling All Coyotes, it's very good at showing the different types of calls and how to time their use. All of the hunts in this video series are done in the daytime as well.|`|LHk0Mu0Xaa	HI<br>  THE BEST THING I HAVE FOUND IS TAKING SPOUNGES AND TO SOAK THEM WITH OIL MEAT OIL, THEY WILL SWALLOW IT WHOLE WHERE A DOG CHEWS THEIR FOOD.  THIS SEEMED TO WORK FOR ME, SO FAR SO GOOD.  THEY ARE HARD TO GET A BEAD ON.  WHEN THEY SWALLOW IT IT WILL  SLOWLY LOCK THEIR SYSTEM DOWN.  YOU MAY HAVE TO RESOAK THEM A COUPLE OF TIMES UNTIL THEY TAKE IT.<br>                                                                       GOOD LUCK<br>                                                                       GARY|`|FLBuzlCuaa	I have always baited them with fish and meat.. along my property at night because they kept getting at my dog when she was out. If I see them in the day time it's kill on sight. I'd try some sort of meat product. Make sure it's raw. A dead rabbit works well too. I've been doing it this way for a few years and it seems to work well. I cleared out the population around my house pretty well. I don't see them too often anymore. Good luck..<br>  <br>  P.S. I'm am not an avid hunter so i'm sure someone else will have a more professional answer for you... but if you have some free time, give it a shot.|`|llcbe14kaa	This may sound cruel but here goes...... I live in an area that is overrun by coyotes. We are also overrun by feral barn cats. I trap the cats in steel mesh live traps, then carry them (in the cage) to my favorite spot. The coyotes come to the cats, at a run, day or night and the coyotes cannot get to the cats to cause them any harm. Personally, I release them in areas where they'll have better opportunities to find food once they've fulfilled their patriotic duties as decoys. Barring that, you can get battery operated "quiver rabbit" decoys that you can perch on top of a hay-bale and use in conjunction with a predator call.<br>  I also have one of the H&R .22 Hornets but I don't use it for coyotes anymore. Too many coyotes run away to suffer and die at a later time and torture isn't my game. I have been using an H&R .243 Heavy Barrel with great success. It is one accurate little bugger! I also do quite a bit with my M-4 Carbine.|`|cR7Sf4cjaa	I am a long time Alaskan hunter and trapper.<br>  <br>  You can't shoot what you can't see.  Hearing them at night and getting a clean shot off is literally night and day.  Invest in a decent digital camera and try taking photos of them - get to know the area - learn about them.<br>  <br>  You need to start doing activities, going places, and doing things  that will allow you to see them in the day or attract them.  How you do this depends on the state laws and what you have handy - setting up a bait stand and shooting cannines over bait is totally illegal in many states.  Leaving out bait that harms the animals (as one guy suggested)  is actually already illegal in all states and comes with a heavy fine.  <br>  <br>  Your coyotes are eating something.  Find it - you find your coyotes.  If you are lucky it's a carcass of some large animal - this they will come back to time and again, and some will visit in the daytime too.  This is ten times better than setting out something and hoping they find it.  Dawn and dusk are the best times to be out there.  Only the inexperienced and young coyotes are out in the daytime.<br>  <br>  Fact is for every coyote you see in the day there will be 6 you missed that are out at night.  This is why trapping is the best way to control coyote populations.  You can spend 6 hours hunting and come home empty.  Spend six hours setting traps - you will come home with 3 or more coyotes the next day.  My best has been 9 in one night using just 18 leg hold traps.  Location, location, location. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|HJTs6qppaa	Your location sounds fine, now get yourself a coyote call, practice a little at home then give it a try. If their not that wise to a call you should have a pretty good chance at a shot.
uXdx9vuBaa	i have that bike!!  I dont use it as much anymore b/c i got a better one now that fits me better.  But i found that it doesnt really matter where you take your bike.  It depends on the bike mechanic.  If you can find a good bike mechanic, thats a bonus.  I went to several bike shops and ended up spending alot of money on repairs b/c of shitty mechanics. I finally found a good one and i stick to that one bike shop no matter what bikes they specialize in.  I also do know that going to a bike shop that specializes in cannondales will help b/c that all they do. However, it doesnt mean the mechanic is great.  Finding a good bike mechanic who is honest and will fix your bike for a good price is key. Remember you can always take it to a bike shop and have them look at your bike and quote you first just like when you get your car repairs.  From there you can take it or call other bike shops to compare.|`|XUUDRM7yaa	There really isn't anything too special about your HeadShok, and many shops are familiar with them.....if they aren't, they can find out what they need and still do a good job servicing it if needed.  Now, if you had one of their Lefty forks the same info would apply, but the Leftys are a bit more complex and require some special tools and know-how.  Everything else on your F400 is standard stuff and in that regard it doesn't matter who you have work on it.  Cannondale does some proprietary things with some of their road bottom brackets and headsets (and on a few of their high-end mountain bikes), but as I said, your F400 is for all purposes just a normal bike, pretty much the same as any other hardtail except that you have a HeadShok instead of another suspension fork.   It's really not a big deal and any decent mechanic will do.   As said above, do search around for a good mechanic that is both competent and will take the time to listen to you and/or ask you questions when you bring your bike in for service.  No matter what bike you ride, developing a good relationship with a good wrench and a shop that you like is a great thing, so try to do it.  :o)|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Your warranty may be void if it is assembled by an unauthorized dealer. Find an authorized dealer to assemble it.|`|Cl6KbcAGaa	A shop that builds your cannondale (crack and fail) to your satisfaction is not going to just start carrying that brand because they did a good job building one....does not work that way. Anyway why dont you just ask them if they can..... I live on the east coast and work for PBS and we do not specialize in full suspension as or terrain is mostly flat and there is not much need for them however we do know about them and specs associated with them and we will tackle just about anything that comes in the door as we are varied in experience in all types of ridding and styles of that and most bike shops should also be too so just because they dont sell a specific brand does not mean they cannot work on yours, THEY CAN, and they will back up their work with a guarantee or ....you go somewhere else and they should get out of the business! You must ASK and you will know...dont ask us ASK THEM!|`|tXg464rTaa	If the Cannondale bike is assembled by them to your satisfaction, it may prompt that shop to carry the Cannondale line.|`|7l4tR0aZaa	im sure they could, but it would be better if u found a shop that could

You'll be happier in the long run.|`|QTd8MVDjaa	You aren't gonna find a decent AEG for $50. You'll probably have to get a spring single shot gun. You could get a UTG spring shotgun for about $40. They only shoot one BB per pump, but they are very accurate and you can pump and shoot pretty fast with it. The UTG M87 SOS shotgun has an M4 style stock on it, but you can get versions with no stock or regular solid stock. You can get a DPMS K-Kat M4 spring rifle for $45. Or a UTG MP5 spring SMG for $50.

l4WEwTWwaa	Although I think Hatton will give Pac a better challenge than DLH did (Hatton will fight with a heartbeat) I think Pac will win. Pac just has too much speed for Hatton to deal with. Hatton struggles against opponents with speed as evidenced by his fight with Luis Collazo. Collazo not only went the distance with him but he only lost by two rounds. Pac is not only faster than Collazo, but a harder hitter too. I see Pac landing twenty punches to Hatton's two on route to a late round stoppage or Unanimous Decision. Hatton looked bad in his fight with Malignaggi and had him hurt several times but was hesitant to go after him. If he repeats that against Pac if he manages to hurt him by a miracle, he will lose easily. My money is on Pacquiao.|`|thcr8Y5vaa	Pacquiao...|`|SMjHwYvcaa	im gonna go with the upset and pick hatton    although hatton isnt as fast as pac man, hatton is a brawler and has the speed to keep up wit pac man|`|2k8TEiRtaa	Pacman, If he stays off the ropes.And I think he will. Hatton will have to spend his time trying to corner Pacquiao. I don't see it happening. Manny is way to quick and hits very hard. It will not be as dectructive as the DLH fight. But Manny will win.|`|rhgVEXkDaa	Pacquiao wins, more competative than the de la hoya fight, but pacquiao wins. I am basing it on hattons performance on malinaggi which was good but not stellar.|`|LSg84ucPaa	It's really hard to tell man, seriously this can go either way though Manny seems to have the upper hand, but then again Hatton can come in with his style and throw in an astonishing performance, especially since its a big fight, and all his fans will be rooting with the drums and songs.    Its gonna be good my friend :)|`|eGhED8ZPaa	Pacquiao definitely|`|11nqBcOcaa	pac is too fast for hatton although hatton hits hard.hatton likes to wrestle & tie up all nite that could frustrate pacman but hatton is no match for him.|`|HAllFbMUaa	would love to see ricky win but pacquaio will have too much for him i think. ricky's style is tailor made for manny who will beat him to the punch and counter him all night. hatton's size shouldn't cause him a problem either given he destroyed a much bigger de la hoya. it should be a great fight though with plenty of action|`|PzaJO1Ekaa	Manny would win. why do you think floyd sr. is hyping up ricky hatton so much. he's trying to intimidate manny in a psywar. he know's hatton has a better chance at beating satan than he does at beating manny.|`|BIxOSi5Qaa	Let's see, you have Hatton, a brawler by nature. He is like a juggernaut when he's moving forward. Hits as hard as anybody else. Then you have Pac, his last fights saw his developtment from a mere scrapper to a well defined boxer-puncher. He won most of his earlier fights going toe to toe and throwing punches with wild abandon.    Both fighters are fearless, both will not back down and both wont quit on their stools.    That's why im picking Pac for this fight. Hatton will all his power and relentless style will be too slow for Pac. Speed kills. Pac has turned from a quick brawler into a powerful, lightning fast, tactically efficient boxer-puncher. He has the complete package. To any opponent, that is a scary thought.    Pac in 9.|`|LK6GOl02aa	pacquiao win this fight KO in nine      Freddie Roach didnt waste his time laying out his plan for the Manny Pacquiao-Ricky Hatton fight on May 2 in Las Vegas.    Knockout, he told The STAR which caught todays hottest trainer by phone yesterday noon (Friday evening in Los Angeles).    Roach said that like everybody else, he felt great that the fight, after all the negotiations and some useless debates, is pushing through.    Its great. Of course, Roach said as he walked back to his apartment after closing the doors to his Wild Card Gym in Hollywood.    Its time to do the homework.    Well open up training camp on March 1. Well get ready, be in shape and take care of this guy, said Roach.    And probably fight Antonio Margarito later on.    Roach still hasnt talked to Pacquiao despite persistent attempts on his part. Over the last two weeks hes been trying.    Manny hasnt talked to me yet. I wanted him to know Im on his side, not like some crooks, he said without elaborating.    The Pacquiao-Hatton fight, which could be the biggest this year, almost didnt push through due to disputes on the purse.    Now theres a deal, and Pacquiao stands to earn as much as $20 million or close to a billion pesos. Hatton will get just a little less.    Manny had a problem with one thing in the deal but we worked it out, Bob Arum told ESPN.com. I massaged something in the deal, which Im not going to tell you about, but it didnt cost me anything. We got it done.    Insiders say that massage was worth at least $1 million, giving Pacquiao a guaranteed purse of $13 million and a 52-48 share of everything else.    Roach said the impasse was all part of the game.    You negotiate first and thats how it is. It only becomes a deal when everybody is happy, said Roach.    Pacquiao has won his last nine fights, including great ones against Oscar dela Hoya, David Diaz, Juan Manuel Marquez, Marco Antonio Barrera and Erik Morales.    And Hatton is the best fight for him right now, said Roach, who sees Pacquiao catching Hatton in the later rounds..    Nine is my favorite number, he said, hinting of a stoppage inside nine rounds.    Hatton is made for Manny. Hes a tough guy who comes forward. Hes a game guy looking to mug you. Thats the perfect style for Manny, Roach told The Sweet Science.    You dont have to chase Hatton. You dont have to look for Ricky. You know where hes going to be. Hes right there in front of you, which is what Manny likes. He likes a guy who wants to try and make it a fight.      Thats half the job done for Roach.

So snowboards are designed to be flexed from that weight.  (If that makes sense)  However, if you're already an experienced rider, I would highly recommend demoing your board before you buy it.

mK06dus9aa	Greetings. I like your avatar more than your football team Liverpool :o)    Unfortunately there are some people who confuse love of their own country with a needless and idiotic hatred of other countries.     But talking about football in isolation the rivalry with Argentina goes back to the Maradona "hand of God" incident - I find this crazy and I view a game with Argentina the same as one against any other strong football nation.|`|sERu7otlaa	nah its more intense with germany|`|o7gV56ngaa	No, you Argies are ok. You just occupied our Falkland Islands for a short time, but those bloody Germans bombed our local fish and chip shop in the second world war. Now that's sacrilegious.|`|mSANH9HYaa	we just hate the arges like they hate us good enough for me man u fans should be told to stop singing argentina|`|AA12299134	No, I think there are bigger rivalries which have been going on longer.      England v Scotland  England v Germany  Argentina v Brazil  Spain v Portugal  Russia v Poland    These are cultural as well as historic or political, whereas the England/Argentina thing has only really being going since 1982.|`|ZcHUWJrtaa	hmmmm, not really. It is a big rivalry though. El Salvador and Honduras had a war between both countries that originated after a football match.    Probably the biggest rivals are Brazil and Argentina, Italy and Brazil, Italy and Germany, Mexico and United States, England and Germany, Spain vs Italy....and some others|`|KasfoGILaa	Between Tevez slitting his throat to play for an English club, and Diego Simeone becoming a true FAILure I believe the rivarly is dead..... well at least one of those is true ;)|`|UZUl0vG8aa	Na only The england players would of been angry

efDJWFNHaa	I think you should switch to a four-stroke 250, unless you do freestyle religiously. But as for what kind of bike, Hondas are the most reliable, and when you get one try to get a totally stock one, and you're probably gonna spend like 3-3.5k|`|d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	I think you will definitely want to stick with a 2 stroke in those year models. Buying a 4 stroke race bike that is 2005 or older could be risky. I would get the latest model possible. A 2005 YZ250 would be a great choice. You can find a really nice one for around $3000.
sHzPnGXHaa	its on right now on comcast sports net bay area|`|13XU8cCKaa	It was a really good game with a lot of back and forth action.  I was shocked.  They played very well last night.|`|xZK4dIHxaa	unbelievable, they played defense!!!|`|AA12339493	ill tell you this much, it was the warriors' first road win against a team with a 500 or better record. probably the best game the warriors have played all year. what's surprising is that the warriors actually won a game without scoring over 100. and they didnt give up 100 pts either. lot of back and forth, but the warriors D was great for once. ronny turiaf basically neutralized david west and it was obvious west was getting frustrated with ronny. maggette and jackson started off really cold until about the 2nd half when they started to make shots they were supposed to make. monta played D against peja, you would think peja would have the advantage but since peja doesnt post up, he basically didnt do too much. monta is still a shell of his former self, the speed and athleticism isnt there, but he will get back to game shape. good to see the warriors play well on national tv after getting raped by dallas.|`|GBGcI509aa	Yeah it was good.

Sure, they have been down the last couple of seasons, but with the recruiting base they have, they should be back on top as early as next season.<br>  You have to admit Clausen has gotten better and if you can't see that you obviously know nothing about football.  But I'm sure you can easily see how improved he got.<br>  I've loved ND all my life and I can't wait until they win a National Championship.<br>  <br>  GO IRISH!|`|ENBhz7Asaa	Probably about the time they realize Charlie Weiss is not a good head coach.
0zwnZKwiaa	Simon no doubt in the top 10 .. monfils erm speechless.

He does well in the majority of the tournaments he enters. He works just as hard as the other players.<br>  And Monfils, well, I think he is a talented player, but he does have some things to work on.|`|LALDdLkNaa	Disagree as everyone is where they deserve to be as they wouldnt be ranked there otherwise. <br>  Simons been consistent and Monfils can be good or bad but will drop about 10 places if he doesnt defend his points at the french open so may drop out in may.<br>  <br>  Tsonga is no.11 so he hasnt got much to do to be in the top 10 and I expect hell get there gasguet's got a bit to do buts hes got the talent as hes been there before.|`|mGgvW4xhaa	Simon and Gael deserve to be in the top ten. They've been working so hard for the past few years and they deserve to be rewarded. :)|`|AA12034105	I think Simon deserves his place in the top 10 :)<br>  Monfils has good days and bad days lol but he has earned his place I guess lol|`|gCGbbIMcaa	Simon definitely deserves to be in the top 10!!
sfXTRJWcaa	No way Lincecum is the real deal, he is way too valuable to trade away for Hamilton. There's plenty of lower end fish in the sea who can do for you what Hamilton will do.|`|560bTFitaa	Take Lincecum.  He threw alot last year, but I don't think that any arm problems will develop until next year.  I don't trust Hamilton to do any better than he did last year.  If that is the case, you can fill you outfield with other players of similar ability.|`|G537VEYSaa	No Lincicum is going to shine this year, i think hamilton just got lucky..... Lincicum is the next best thing...... keep him and dont let him get away|`|gyi9hjjwaa	yes good deal beause hmilton will have good season lincicum has no xp|`|ySB6dZYlaa	No way Tim Lincecum is going to get better.|`|SEcM9EDZaa	As a rule, you always take a good hitter over a good pitcher. Hamilton slumped after the break last year but should be more consistent this year.<br>  Lincecum threw a lot of innings last year but given his unusual delivery there's no way to tell how it will affect him this year.<br>  I think Hamilton is the safer play here.
KJMOvKcSaa	Hubba wheels company specializes on wheels. They are always finding a way to improve them. Wheels are the only thing they make. Wheels size really doesn't matter to most skaters. Hope this helped.|`|pqSGMukvaa	101s have hardly any grip... id step down in A and stay at 52<br>  i use 99s actually...|`|TJvKnjzDaa	It matters what kind of skating you do. If you do street, go for a smaller wheel. If you do vert, go for a bigger wheel. I skate street and I use 52 because if I had a size 50mm wheel, it would go down to a size 40 something (i.e 48 or 49mm)
N0N9FzEhaa	Well granny let me tell you straight! The little tini boppers did screw the WWE! There should be an age limit to it cause alot has change no more hardcore matches no more Divas shaking there @**!! I aint gonna sugar coat it, they F****ed up everything y'all kiddies should stick to watching Mucha Lucha or something!! Its not always whats good for the goose is good for the gander remember that! I dont care how much thumbs down I get cause i know its all from tini boppers who wouldn't agree. F*** ya'll i'm just keeping it real SUCKAS!|`|A4tps9Klaa	I think that young fans are GREAT for the WWE and pro wrestling in general, and i don't personally see how they have "ruined" the WWE. I agree with the notion that most people probably get into wrestling as kids (as I did; i started watching at about age 10 and now i'm 25 and I still watch), and the love for wrestling stays with them as adults. WWE is probably going PG only for the time being because of many factors such as the economy, widening their audience to more age groups, etc. I feel that young fans are a necessity for WWE to do well. As for the WWE being PG, this is just a phase, and it will likely change again somewhere down the line. The Attitude Era, as great as it was, was also a phase that eventually passed. I've followed wrestling since the PG WWF days of  the mid 90's, through the Attitude Era, to the modern day WWE. It just goes in cycles, and this is no different. I would never blame kids for the WWE becoming PG; this was a decision made by the WWE from a marketing standpoint.|`|D5Kl3BEqaa	What is your definition of a young fan? Someone under 18? Under 16? Under 13? You can't say they have ruined wrestling. Your basically saying their opinion doesn't matter which basically means they don't have a right to be a wrestling fan. 90% of wrestling fans became fans under the age of 18. Imagine when you were under 18 (or if you still are) and someone says you don't matter.They hav a right to be a fan as much as anyone else.|`|C1C0r9eMaa	yeye <br>  <br>  new fans here too! 14 thumbs down on the user survivor jerichoholic?<br>  kidding right?These new fans don't know what the attitude era is i mean they actually think that all the new superstars that gets pushes are better then edge hardy boys brothers of destruction jbl big show and the rest. I don't say that they have ruined wwe but to put thumbs down on a comment where it says more hardcore matches etc?<br>  <br>  WWE is still the best and nobody is better!<br>  TNA?they can enjoy the time they've had so far cuz they wiill go down omg<br>  <br>  And some people say that they would rather have the PG thing more then the attitude era?<br>  I think that the PG thing is a great thing<br>  but saying that its better then the attitude era?<br>  nothing can beat it|`|DUJnkYDzaa	Some do... but you need to be specific with you age range because im 15 and ive been watching wrestling since i could watch tv. Longer than some adults and they want to say that young people have ruined it, well I consider myself young and I havent ruined anything. And how can you come on here bashing little kids it just shows how mature you are. Why cant kids watch wrestling or go to wrestling events that should be up to their parents not some old lady who sits around bashing kids because thay act like well kids. I really think you need to grow up.|`|ImOcVhwLaa	No! <br>  No,and actually it would be FCW.<br>  No.WWE has been letting young fans into the arenas for years!<br>  Who cares if Cena changed the name of his finisher!<br>  Stupid.<br>  I knew what OVW is and WWE doesn't use OVW as a training ground anymore! They use Florida Championship Wrestling(FCW)|`|OfutBhxYaa	no|`|zhXFtgPqaa	I completely disagree with you, if you look at videos of wrestling from 15 years ago until now you can see kids in the audience. When you watch wrestler's DVDs they talk about how they watched wrestling as a kid, kids have been watching wrestling for a long long time.<br>  <br>  People don't complain when kids watch NBA or NFL or any other sport or television show, just because the WWE is now for all ages doesn't mean that it is a bad show, you just have to find the good in it. Like the fact that they are focusing more on wrestling because they can't resort to undressed women or vulgur promos.<br>  <br>  And I still know many parents that don't allow their kids to watch wrestling because of the level of violence that they still have. It's not all pure and made for kids. <br>  <br>  Now as far as Cena and Batista. They didn't come out one day and say, I am a wrestler for the kids, they came out and did the same thing that many other faces have done the only thing is that kids just seemed to cling to them more. Cena is not a "kid star", if you watched any episode of 5 questions he swore continually, not so much a great example for kids, but that is just who he is and kids clung to him.<br>  <br>  They don't need to raise the ticket price because they have been allowing kids to come to shows for a long time now and will continue to, just get over yourself and stop looking down on the younger generation of wrestling fans. I myself have been watching wrestling since I was a kid. The WWE is still the WWE, not a disney channel show.|`|2FKHNIB2aa	wow grandma how would you feel if someone told you that when you where a kid watching wrestling?|`|ZbNXVQu7aa	You say WWE was good until 2005/06, and I agree, but for a much different reason.<br>  <br>  When Eddie Guerrero was still alive, WWE was so much better than it is today (and I like the storylines today much better than I liked the storylines of the "Attitude Era", which should give you an idea of just how big a loss Eddie's passing was).<br>  <br>  As for your original question, young fans might have "ruined" WWE for some of the older fans, but without those young fans, the WWE will cease to exist when the older fans cease to exist.  It's good business for the WWE to "cater" to the young fans, as it allows the company to survive long-term.<br>  <br>  I have a 7 1/2-month old nephew, and when he turns 6 or 7, I would gladly let him watch a John Cena match with me.  If this were still the "Attitude Era", I would likely have to keep him away from a Kane match until he becomes a teenager, which would mean he would have to watch DVDs if he wanted to see the talented wrestler in action (which is nice, but it's not even close to being as nice as watching Monday Night RAW, Friday Night SmackDown, or a PPV when it first airs).|`|TAPBWPJLaa	No.<br>  <br>  People act as if the WWE roster was replaced by Telletubbies and the Kids Next Door. How much has changed besides less blood, weapon shots, and cursing? Barely anything! There's still wrestlers doing sneak attacks. There's still the same types of bad guys attacking good guys. There's still the same types of violence exhibited in matches as well. The Divas still barely wear clothes. <br>  <br>  If you watch the WWE to feel like a big kid or because violence is cool, then you're watching for the wrong reason. Professional Wrestling is not supposed to be all mindless violence and gratuitous displays, and even when it was all like that, kids were still watching the WWE anyways, so what's the point of this argument?<br>  <br>  **By the way, OVW was WWE's old training facility, but it hasn't been for a while. Now, WWE primarily uses Florida Championship Wrestling.|`|bnm9BfxDaa	well yes of course!!! the younger people just like to laugh at cena's corny jokes. i am only 15 years of age but i started watching wrestling back during the Attitude ERA. boy were those the days. i learned everything there is to know about the WWE back in 1999 to 2001. now we have batista who doesnt know how to wrestle and only uses 5 moves. not to mention no mic skills. the man has no charisma and always seems uninterested. john cena has 5 moves and thats it. nothing but mic skills. but i will say that back in the Attitude era there were more superstars with crappy gimmicks|`|AA11312903	They shouldn't shun little kids out because i became a fan of theirs as a kid. However they should come to a compromise where we'll have gimmicks and storylines that kids can relate to on a daily basis but still give the older fans the promos and the violence we grew up watching nad becoming fans of...|`|3I6YUfg0aa	young fans? what age?<br>  i am 16, and i love randy orton? am i an exception?

The most important determiner is what the other teams in your league look like.  This team has some very good talent on it but comparatively I don't know what other kinds of teams you're going up against.  The other major issue is you have A LOT of Yankees.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing since the Yanks should have a pretty good season but you're basically hinging your success on the Yankees.  If the Yankees have a bad stretch where they lose like 5 or 6 straight games you're probably going to be negatively affected.  Overall I'd give your team a 5 or 6; potential to be very good or very bad.|`|sfXTRJWcaa	This team is decent. I'll give you a 6.5 if its a standard 12 team league. Your outfield could use alot of help and you have waaay to many Yankees. Its ok to have a couple of players on the same team but you have 13 Yankees. This man that you won't have any diversity in your scoring (u'll have practically noone playing for three days in a row then you'll have your whole team playing three days in a row) plus when the Yankees don't fair so well, you won't fair so well. You should trade a couple of your yankees for some outfielders.|`|G537VEYSaa	thats horrible..... honestly, who the heck is connor jackson, and behind the plate is supposed to be russel martin, phil coke sucks, burnett sucks, too many yankees Adam Lind<br>  (Tor - OF)<br>  <br>  Ian Stewart<br>  (Col - 2B,3B) <br>  who are they, they suck !!!! what are you thinking ???? honestly????? u would suck in fantasy baseball !!!!!<br>  i give it a 5 <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  thats my opinoin|`|1uNK9Ntdaa	Too many Yankees<br>  <br>  5 of 10

1w5blbobaa	Definitely SHE CAN,& I don't think age will be a factor for her.The way she is playing right now She hd decent chance of winning.<br>  The 2 obstacles can be.....<br>  1)her fitness will be a deciding factor.<br>  2)Sister Serena will be her toughest opponent as Serena is also toooo much hungry for her 3rd Wimbledon title & She will definitely try 2 take the revenge of her last yr's defeat from Venus.<br>  <br>  Bt still I think Venus had a good chance to make it 6 .|`|ea059efe053f1e8b4703c42abc3c7a5caa	Ah yeah.  She and Serena are in the older category compared to the other players but when they're both playing their A games, not even the Serbians or the Russians can touch them.  Venus is especially dangerous on grass because it's her favorite surface hence her 5 wins.  I'm actually glad that they're playing more tennis this year and they look determined.  Before, I just got used to hearing the Williams sisters claim injury or some form of excuse not to play...but now they're playing even in the lower level tournaments.  It's a good thing.  Like I said, if they have their A game, it is either Venus winning again or Serena this time.  Nobody else can touch the two when they're on.|`|AA12034105	Age doesn't really seem to effect Venus haha :P<br>  I think she has a great chance of winning Wimbledon again this year :)  I think it will be either her or Serena lol|`|KJmuHxcCaa	Hmm u never know with her do you..
