I heard this song on a local hip hop station (and Reno has limited access *lol*).  Trouble is I don't know the artist or the name, and I can't even really come up with lyircs to search.  It's a fast paced reggae & latin sounding song, trumpet & pumping beats in the back and most of the song is a reggae sounding chorus, although I don't think any actual reggaeton is used.  I don't think it's very new, because it wouldn't be playing here if it was, but it's probably not more than 6 months old either.  Any ideas?  I MUST HAVE THIS SONG!

Yes, there are some really good ones, but my favorite will always be the originals. Siouxsie And The Banshees have been a favorite of mine for years.

Anyway, I was just curious who else likes this band. Thank you for your answer.

20090131102114AA3IyN3	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Fred Meyer dvd return without reciept but unopened? Help!?	A week before christmas I bought the movie Mission Impossible 3 single disk on dvd for $9.99 at Fred Meyer. But just last night while shopping at Walmart, I noticed a 2 for $8 dvd shelf/display with some pretty decent dvds. Looking though the display, I quickly noticed that they had MI3 on dvd...but it was the 2-disc version which has more features than the one I had bought before. My question is, can I take back the MI3 one-disc back to Fred Meyer even if I lost the reciept, and can they still give me a refund even without one? Like I said, the dvd is unopened and I'm thinking about using the money I get back to go to Walmart and buy the 2-disc one for only $4 instead. Can they do this, thanks.

What do you think? Also is it true someone was actually going to smoke his ashes or was that just a big gimmick. One last question, does anybody know were I can find a good picture of  Kurt Cobain from behind playing his guitar or mabey from the front playing with his hair in his eyes. I am doing an art peice and I am going to have a his face in the front and him playing in the background.      Thanks for reading.   We Love You Kurt

20090131103614AAPra1R	Entertainment & Music;Movies	What is this movie called?	When I was a child I saw a very special movie on swedish television one night. I loved the movie and have been wondering since then what it was called. It was an american/british film.Here is a summary of the story, unfortunately I can only remember fragments of the plot: A very mean lady owns a hotel.  The owner asks all women who check in if they are orphans. If they are,  roomservice will kidnap them and force them to work in a firework factory nearby. I think the owner of the hotel also owns this factory. Other fragments that I can remember is an elvator which only works if people tap dance in it. I think the fireworks factory explodes in the end of the movie and all women are released. They also sing a song in this movie called: hop like a kangaroo . Yes the plot sounds crazy and it was a very funny movie, maybe it was a muscial?  Can anyone help me with the title?

20090131113640AAl9JKW	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	What do you think of my top 11 anime moments?	Haters Get Lost!      11- Cheerleader Haruhi & Baseball   As usual Haruhi forces Mikuru to do something sexy and when it's her turn at bat she catches all the guy's attention, staring at her legs lol. Male reactions to lust is always funny in anime      10- Pichan's Nose Bleed   Ranma turns Ryoga into Pichan to find something hidden in the girls locker room. When he's spotted by Akane's friend she takes him and hugs him into her topless chest....pressing him deep into her boobs and blood squirts out. When turned back into Ryoga he's struck with pleasure and happy thoughts.      9- Noir Chase; Episode 1   First episode of Noir had Mireille chasing Kirika around a building with a bunch of dudes after them, GOD! WHAT AN AWESOME TRACK! It was suspenseful and had those 2 girls wipe out the men in suits!      8- Cell vs Gohan   Android 16 is destroyed by Cell and at that moment Gohan becomes all badass and BASHES cell into 2morrow!(Or would have if Cell was human). Cell completely powerless after being all cocky and arrogant.      7- Yusuke in Kazuma   Yusuke had to tell Keiko, a girl he sexually harasses, to tell his mom not to bury his body so he can come back to life, with time running out he goes into his mortal enemy's body, Kazuma, and to prove it's him inside, he uses Kazuma's body to grab Keiko's boobs....then she believes its him      6- Wakabayashi's Attack:   Tsubasa's team is down 2-1 (tied 1-1 in Captain Tsubasa J version), and Hyuga's team is about to score another goal when in a moment of desperation, Genzo Wakabayashi STRIKES!!! Takes the ball from Hyuga and leaves the penalty box to help Tsubasa score the equalizer (winning goal in CTJ). Nothing is more intense then when the goalkeeper attacks!       5- Seijuru Hiko Saves Kenshin   In the movie Samurai X tells the story of Kenshin's past, he's walking happily with his kind owners but suddenly are attacked and killed by a bunch of gun for hire samurai right in front his own eyes when his soon-to-be master so calmly and swiftly SLASHES the samurai into pieces without even trying! GOD!! That was awesome!      4- Mustang's Return   Fullmetal Alchemist The Movie was going bad because Mustang was acting all emo and pathetic, I mean I can;t blame him but it just wasn't him to be like that. But finally when the chance came to redeem himself he came back to took control of the army! He proved that without him the military is NOTHING! He returned to his old self and strictly yet calmly gave out orders and despite being a lower rank they all followed him!       3- L Tricks Kira   Light is tricked into killing Lind L.Taylor, L's stand in is killed in on live television in Kanto Japan. Announcing the message as a worldwide broadcast was so genius yet so simple I can't believe I didn't think about it. To top it off, using a criminal who is completely unknown to flush Kira out...wow. A risk that could have gotten L in trouble if everything went wrong.      2- Cowboy Bebop Ending   Spike Spiegal shot and faints, but should we cry? It hasn't been confirmed that he's dead. But what a way to end a series! Leaves the viewers wanting more and anything is possible now to the point where the creator considers continuing the series if they can get it right.       1- The final confrontation between Optimus Prime and Megatron:   Megatron and the Decepticons intercept an Autobot shuttle which was supposed to bring back energon from Earth to their base on one of Cybertrons moons in order to launch a full scale assault to reclaim their planet from the Decepticons. The Decepticons completely wipe them all out killing everyone! They use the ship to get past Autobot defenses on Earth where they strike and kill all the Autobots on Autobot City and block transmission (just seconds after they radio Prime), few survivors are left standing continuing to fight, hours later Optimus arrives and with no time to waste goes after Megatron to finally end it. The fight was epic and Optimus Prime had the upper hand!

It is from an orthopedic surgeon............    This will boggle your mind and you will keep trying over and over again   to see if you can outsmart your foot, but, you can't.   It's pre-programmed in your brain!      1. Without anyone watching you (they will think you are GOOFY......) and   while sitting at your desk in front of your computer, lift your right   foot off the floor and make clockwise circles.      2. Now, while doing this, draw the number '6' in the air with your right   hand. Your foot will change direction.      I told you so!!! And there's nothing you can do about it! You and I both   know how stupid it is, but before the day is done you are going to try   it again, if you' ve not already done so.             Now that you have looked around to see if anyone was looking try it again :)

I was at work and in the break room and two other co-workers were flipping channels and nothing was really on so we just kept it on this channel that had a sci-fi show already in progress. We weren't really paying any mind to it until a scene where a girl was trying to seduce a guy.  The guy was saying how he lost his wife and he never thought he could get passed it yet he did but never in a million years would he ever get it on with her.  Yes he trusted her professionally but she was too much of a hot mess to be bothered with. LOL.  My co-workers and I were like "What tv show is this?!"  It was a cool scene and even though the girl didn't say much to or during that monologue you could still see the pain he was causing her.   It was the worst(best) rejection I  ever saw.  Then our break was over so we didn't get to see what show it was.

20090131131904AAWvMox	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	~~Anime Survey # 1~~?	Heyyy people, this is my first anime survey. I was bored so I thought why not do a survey. Let me think what I should put... wait i've got it, so here it goes.      #1.)  What if someone said that they have to remove one thing from your life. What would you choose?   My answer is C because I am not a sport type of person. So if that got removed from my life I wouldn't mind at all ^_^   A.) Video Games   B.) Anime's/ Manga   C.)Sports   D.)Pizza   E.)Music      #2.) If you can spend one day in an anime which one would it be? My answer would be A because I will get to meet Inuyasha. WOW THAT WOULD BE SO COOL! Except for the part by getting attacked from the demons. But who cares Inuyasha would save me and he would be my hero lol   A.)Inuyasha   B.)Fullmetal Alchemist   C.)Bleach   D.)Death note   E.)Naruto   F.)Fruits Basket   G.)Code Geass      Question #1: What age did you start to watch anime's. I just started to watch them 4 months ago. I used think they were lame, but look at me now. I cant stop watching them for a day.      Question #2: Whats the one thing you dislike about anime's. What I hate about it is the flashbacks because they show the parts that you have already seen which gets really annoying.      That is all for the survey. I am looking forward in seeing your answers. I will also make more surveys because I enjoy making them for you!   Have a nice day. Bye

20090131122428AAcXYDB	Entertainment & Music;Television;Drama	What season are these two OC episodes?	I have been watching some of the OC and have been following two different episodes/seasons and am wondering which came first, and what seasons I am watching.       The first has events including: Seth and Anna break up and Seth and Summer get back together. Ryan and Marissa are having a hard time because of this guy named Oliver that turned out to be crazy. Also Teresa came to visit Ryan, and it turns out she's engaged to Eddie. Finally, Luke and Mrs. Cooper start seeing each other.      The second season I am watching has events like: Trey tried to rape Marissa, and then Marissa finally told Summer, who told Seth who told Ryan. Ryan went to Trey's house, and they fought, then Marissa showed up and shot Trey to save Ryan. Also Mrs. Cohen's dad died, and she was taken to a rehab centre for drinking.      If any one could tell me:      - What season these are   - Which happened first (I am guessing the second description?)   - and if anyone knows a good website I could go on to read episode summaries, or any other info about the OC, I would really appreciate any addresses.          Thanks so much for all the time taken both reading and answering this question!

"Well, there'd be no problem, because the Bank of Warsaw is insured by the National Bank of Poland."       "And if the National Bank of Poland fails?"    "Then your money would be insured by the Bank of Moscow."       "And what if the Bank of Moscow fails?"    "Then your money would be insured by the Great Bank of the Soviet Union."       "And if that bank fails?"    "Well, in that case, you'd lose all your money. But, wouldn't it be worth it?"             Do you guys have any?

Sometimes I feel like   A light has been shined    Upon my life   That overshadowed yours   I thought love was love   In any form   But now I’m seeing   Love has many faces   Between two of which   I must now choose   Hoping my choice   Will be the right one      My love   You are my life   But now so is he   He’s all I’ve ever dreamed of   That fairy tale prince   Who swept me off my feet   When you were not around      You ask why I have to think   You thought we were perfect   A match made in heaven   And my answer is simple      Love is love   In any form   But some loves   Over power others   Like the sun   Overpowers the night

20090131143726AAytuaE	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Ten point to best answer!!! Can you solve these riddles?	A seven year old has solved all of them. They all have only one answer.   1) A man shoots his wife, holds her under liquid for ten minutes, and then hangs her. An hour later, they go out and enjoy a romantic dinner.   2) A rich lady died and left her family a rare diamond, on the condition that they had to find it. She left one hint: "It's inside a cylinder surrounded by a thousand squares."   3) A king wanted to pass the crown to the wiser of his two sons, so he held a horse race. He said "the son whose horse rides to the lake and returns to the castle last will inherit the kingdom." the younger son jumped on a horse and rode away. The king instantly knew that his younger son would be king. Why?   4) A bus driver named Frank went three blocks down a one-way street- in the wrong direction. On the way, he passed several policemen, but he did not receive a ticket. Why?   5) I have keys but no locks. I have space but no room. I can be entered, but YOU can't come in, even though I AM your type. WHY?   6) You have a dime and a dollar. You buy a dog and a collar. The dog is a dollar more than the collar. How much is the collar?   7) Down in a city park, a baby bird fell into a hole that was four feet deep but only a few inches wide. Some kids who were playing in the sandbox nearby came over to help, but they couldn't reach the bird. Some parents, who were sitting on a bench, watching their children play on the monkey bars, couldn't reach either. They wanted to try using a stick, but were afraid of hurting the bird. Finally, little Annie saw what was happening and got off the swing to help. She said, "I can save the bird, but it will take some time." How will she do it?   8)Written in full, this word describes a place that does not exist at all. Yet if you add one space inside the word, it instantly comes right to you. What is it?   9) Forward I am very heavy, backward I am not. What am I?   10) Both 11+2 and 12+1  equal thirteen, but they have something else in common. What?   11) He starts and ends two painful words. One comes from too little love, the other from too much noise. What are the words?   12)What do subcontinental and and uncomplimentary have in common?   13) what do these words have in common? polish, job, and herb.   This paragraph is out of ordinary. Nothing is wrong, but it is odd. It is missing a part that most things own. Can you spot it? What is wrong? What is missing?   14) What is greater than God, more evil than the devil, rich men need it, poor men have it, and if you eat it you die?

Then he said to himself, "There's something he's needing".      After casting about for a suitable pearl,    He kept messing around and created a girl.       Two beautiful legs, so long and so slender,    Round, slim, and firm, and ever so tender.       Two lovely hips to increase his desire,    And rounded and firm to bring out the fire.       Two lovely breasts, so full and so proud,    Commanding his eyes, as he whispers aloud.       Two lovely arms, just aching to bless you,    And two loving hands, to soothe and caress you.       Soft, cascading hair hung down over her shoulder,    And two dreamy eyes, just to make him grow bolder.       'Twas made for a man, just to make his heart sing.    Then he added a mouth...          Ruined the whole f*cking thing!!!

20090131143027AAHtLyP	Entertainment & Music;Music;Lyrics	What is the emotion that descibes these lyrics?	I stop once again, closing my eyes,    The hate within me finally subsides,    Thinking about these thoughts once more,    Searching for the key to open the door,    To the questions eating me like cancer,    Behind that door, all life's answers.    Just reach the knob, twist, and pull,    Everything then seems to go.    I come back to reality,    Dark skies, cruelty, that's all I see.    Everyone laughing, pointing at me,    Going on with life happily.    Leaving me sad, mad, and low,    Making me wish I could go    Back to the good old days,    Back to my happy ways.    That was then, this is now,    Everyone's changed, somehow.    Happened right under my nose,    During our highs, during our lows.    We had no idea what was happenin,    Our mouths runnin without a captain,    Sayin things we don't really mean,    We need to gain control ASAP.    It never fails, confused again,    Wondering when this pain will end.    Then it goes, for awhile,    I hate these feelings of denial,    I can't be right, never am.    According to all, no way I can.    These jerks I deal with day by day,    Never stop can't go away            also wat emotion are these lyrics      I wish that you could just see   just what its like to be me.   Hiding myself behind this mask of shame   knowing I’m the only one to blame   I wish you would just know   Just what its like to be in this show   Playing myself like I would want to be   Knowing that this is what I want them to see   I sit here hitting the ground   wishing someone hears my true sound   maybe some day you will understand when youve freed me   from what I have always pretended to be   Perhaps you will someday come along   Singing and dancing with this song   Together we can lift our masks and see.   Who we truly are and who we can be   You’ll finally see that this is me

20090131132659AAernTa	Entertainment & Music;Comics & Animation	Vampire Knight dub...worth the wait?	I really want to see Vampire Knight in english dub. But it's taking so long for them to license and dub it! I don't mind watching things in sub but I like it a lot more when it's dubbed. (mostly cuz I'm lazy and don't want to read and I love listening to the sexy deep english voices that some anime guys have lol)       So I'm just wondering if VK will be out anytime soon or should I just suck it up and watch sub? When will it be out? (and I'm not looking for an opinion like "dub sucks" just if it'll be out soon or not.)      Thanks n.n

20081030213157AA8bXgM	Entertainment & Music;Other - Entertainment	What were the fads at your primary education school?	The fads that i can remember from my school were:      Power Rangers show and action figures - a newsletter came out telling our parents not to allow the students to watch the Power Rangers because it led to playground fights. A show with great morale values!      Next were Crazy Bones - I had an "Eggy" did you? Funny thing is that those were apparently rare, yet almost everyone had one. Crazy bones were eventually banned from our school because people would steal them from younger kids.      Pokemon Cards were next. I personally always hated Pokemon, maybe i was too old at the time, but there were kids everywhere with the cards....i found them annoying.      Hockey Cards were the next 'new' fad, but only in grade 5. I had collected them prior though, and stopped around grade 7.      Finally there were Yo-Yos. "Fast Eddie" came to our school, gave a presentation/demonstration, and gave a few out for free. Then they caught on and everyone was "walking the dog" in class; that just upset the Teachers/Staff members and they banned the use of them also while in the school, but allowed them outside during recess.      hmmm, come to think of it, most of the fads at our school got banned.      What were the fads at your school?

The only part I can remember is that one of the cartoons is about a boy that lives on a planet that isnt earth and there is a rose that is kept under a glass (kinda like in beauty and the beast) and when the rose opens up there is a tiny girl inside and she and the boy talk. Thats all I can remember.      The next movie is from the 80's/early 90's. I'm pretty sure that The Disney Channel is where I use to always watch it. It starts out showing the main character (a teenage girl) dreaming about being with the guy she likes. Then she wakes up and goes on with her normal life of being unpopular and the guy she likes doesnt notice her. Then some how she gets this necklace that gives her power. She uses it to become popular and to get the guy she wants. At one point she makes a voodoo doll of her teacher and makes him start undressing in the middle of glass. There is also a fortune teller she goes to see to help her figure out the magic (the fortune teller is a very short lady). By the end of the movie she realizes that she doesnt want the power.       If anyone can tell me the names of either of these I would greatly appreciate it!

"Saudara didakwa membunuh  seorang guru SMA dengan menggunakan gergaji mesin!" kata  hakim.        Dari deretan meja pengunjung terdengar seseorang  berteriak, "Kurang ajaaarrr!!!"      "Harap tenang. Ini ruang sidang!" bentak hakim.  Ia kemudian melanjutkan  tuntutannya, "Saudara juga didakwa melakukan pembunuhan terhadap  seorang loper koran dengan menggunakan sekop!"      "Bajingannnnn!!!" teriak pengunjung yang tadi.   "Tenang, harap tenang!" teriak hakim nggak kalah kerasnya.      "Selanjutnya,saudara terdakwa juga dituduh melakukan pembunuhan terhadap seorang tukang pos dengan menggunakan bor  listrik!" kata hakim sambil memandangi terdakwa.      "Keparatttt!!!!" teriak pengunjung tadi tanpa bisa ditahan.      Dengan geram hakim berkata, "Jika anda tidak bisa  memberikan alasan kenapa berulah seperti ini, maka saya akan mendudukkan anda di kursi pesakitan dengan tuduhan  menghina pengadilan!"      "Saya adalah  tetangga terdakwa selama sepuluh tahun terakhir, Pak Hakim.   Dan setiap kali saya ingin  meminjam gergaji, bor, atau  sekop, dia selalu bilang nggak punya!!!"

Do you think a sex tape would sort of solve te mystery so to speak. also if she is filthy rich then how come she can't afford a car seat? think maybe she is filthy debtful (i.e. OWES millions of dollars to various people/companies in exchange for the perception in the media that she is "sucessfull")

20090131090945AABXliL	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Did your hear about Julian & Sean Lennon performing together next month?	The Lennons       Julian Lennon and Sean Lennon, the sons of John Lennon, are finally going to perform together in public.      Sources say that the Lennon boys have agreed to appear at a United Nations event here in New York on February 26th called the UN-Millenium Goal Awards. Other artists tentatively scheduled to appear include Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora, as well as possibly Akon and Macy Gray.      The show is the brainchild of Rhodesian Sacha Stone, founder in 1999 of the Humanitad Foundation. Stone, who lives in the UK now, is said to have relationships with all involved and convinced the Lennons to come aboard. This would mean putting aside differences between the two former Lennon households.      When John Lennon was murdered in 1980, a rift grew because Sean's mom, Yoko Ono, wouldn't give Julian what he and his mom, Cynthia Lennon, considered a fair share of the estate. Julian Lennon wound up engaging lawyers, and a long legal situation followed. In May 2007 Julian told Howard Stern that he still hadn't gotten any money from Yoko Ono. Unbelievable.      Over the years, there's been plenty of animosity, mostly fueled by Ono. At a 2001 tribute to Lennon at Radio City Music Hall, she all but wiped out any reference to the Beatle's first family. When Cirque du Soleil's "Love" show opened in Las Vegas a few years ago, the severe Ono kept her distance from the amiable Cynthia and Julian. Sean was a no-show.      More recently, though, the two brothers have found more common ground, with Julian surprising Sean in Prague at a 2007 gig. Ironically, the brothers could not be more alike: soft spoken, friendly, and talented. Julian, of course, had success in his 20s with hits like "Valotte" and "Too Late for Goodbyes" in 1984-85. Sean has released a couple of indie albums and one on his dad's old label, Capitol.

I am not saying he is wrong for rejecting some of the auditionees on the show, some are really bad.  Its just the WAY he does it, and other aspects of his personality (hiring and firing presenters at the drop of a hat etc)

20070308101733AAedttZ	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Why isn't the term "ginger" seen as a form of racism?	People call, bully and victimise people just because they are "ginger", using the word as a derogatory term, to make a minority group feel victimised. I mean you don't see the majority of people speaking to someone with such disrespect just because of the colour of their skin, so why should people be rudely spoken to and pinpointed just because of the colour of their hair..  Im fed up of this form of racism, and more so fed up of the media trying to glamourise calling people with "ginger" hair and making a joke out of it.  And don't start having a go at me for making a very serious point, I would be seen as some one with "ginger" hair and yes sometimes i do get abuse for the colour of my hair, and its something i could simply do with out as i dont deserve it..  put yourself in the situation of walking down the street, and for no reason but the colour of your hair some n*bb head decides to shout a derogatory term out to you..   what do you think?

20090131100856AAyFVxu	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Edmonton all ages punk shows?	Oi!       Hey guys, whats up?       I'm kinda new to all this, but I was wondering about the Edmonton punk scene. From what I've heard, it's a really strong thing, with an awesome community that goes way back.       Now, I love punk. I love the music, the passion, the energy, EVERYTHING! Now that I'm in Edmonton, I want to get involved, go to local shows, support the community.       The problem is, I have no idea where to go for shows, or to meet up with other punks. I've gone to a couple shows here, but I definitely want to go to more. I'm still a kid, really (16 years and still going strong!) I'm not sure what venues are good for all ages, but I want to actually get out there.       I've heard some stuff about The Shark Tank, but apparently it got closed down a couple years back. All my mates are trying to convince me to get a fake ID so we can go to shows. Do any venues still mark an "X" on underage kids so they can see the show here?      If anyone here has information about this, I'd be really grateful.      Peace,       -Wolfe

The bar was really crowded and loud so I suggested we go somewhere   quieter to talk. He was still very subdued and distracted so I   suggested we go somewhere nice to eat.   All through dinner he just didn't seem himself; he hardly laughed and   didn't seem to be paying any attention to me or to what I was saying.   I just knew that something was wrong.   He dropped me back home and I wondered if he was going to come in; he   hesitated but followed. I asked him again if there was something the   matter but he just half shook his head and turned the television on.   After about 10 minutes of Silence, I said I was going upstairs to bed.   I put my arms around him and told him that I loved him deeply. He just   gave a sigh and a sad sort of smile. He didn't follow me up but later   he did, and I was surprised when we made love. He still seemed distant   and a bit cold, and I started to think that he was going to leave me   and that he had found someone else. I cried myself to sleep.

20090131110208AA0V9ab	Entertainment & Music;Movies	What do you think about American History X?	? We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory will swell when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature. ?      In the opening scene, Danny Vinyard, a young white supremacist, sits in the principal's office. As we move into the office, we hear and see Danny's history teacher Murray explaining to the principal, Dr. Sweeney, that Danny wrote a book report on Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf. As a result Sweeney informs Danny that he is now Danny's new history teacher. The class is called "American History X" and his first assignment is due the next morning: a paper about his brother, Derek, analyzing all the events leading up to Derek's incarceration and the subsequent impact on Danny's life.      The next scenes are flashbacks explaining Derek's journey from a suburban white teenager to a vengeance-seeking white supremacist. Derek had already been influenced by his firefighter father's latent racism, and is driven to action when his father is murdered in a drive-by shooting; shortly afterward, he goes on an racial slur-laden tirade blaming blacks, Asians and Hispanics for his father's death, saying that most of the crimes in the country are race-driven. Instead of saying "affirmative action", Derek's father says, "affirmative black-tion." His father says that two black men were given positions as firefighters due to quotas even though weren't as qualified for the position as two white men, which endangered the whole firefighting team.      Eventually Derek becomes second-in-command of the Venice Beach Neo-Nazi gang, "The DOC", and entices young whites to join by promising protection from predominantly minority gangs in the area. The gang is masterminded by Cameron Alexander. The gang commits acts of intimidation such as damaging a store owned by a Korean American and challenging basketball games against groups of black players.      One night while Derek is in the midst of rough sex with his girlfriend Stacy and while Danny tries to sleep, three black men arrive on the lawn and break into Derek's truck. Danny interrupts the sex between Stacy and Derek to tell him about the scene outside. Brandishing a handgun, Derek exits the house and violently confronts the men, killing one and wounding another. He also fires on the third man who makes a hasty getaway in a car. After recognizing the wounded man as a player from the earlier basketball game, Derek kills him by ordering him to place his mouth on the curb and then stomping on the back of his head, breaking his neck (a curb stomping). Danny watches in horror, then witnesses his brother submitting to the police officers and smiling triumphantly, presumably because he feels no remorse for his actions.      Derek is sentenced to prison after being charged with voluntary manslaughter. Danny states that if he had testified, Derek would have received life imprisonment for murder. In prison, Derek joins the Aryan Brotherhood for protection. Over time however, Derek becomes disillusioned with the Aryan Brotherhood, especially over the group's dealings with a Mexican gang which Derek thinks his gang should have nothing to do with. Acting out in defiance, Derek angers key members of the Brotherhood and they rape him in the showers while the guard on duty turns a blind eye.      Meanwhile, Derek makes the acquaintance of a black inmate named Lamont while working in the prison laundry room. Although Derek initially scorns Lamont, he gradually warms up to him. Following the rape, his former teacher Dr. Sweeney pays a visit to the prison and Derek, now confused and distraught, asks him for help after all the atrocities he has committed. Sweeney, currently the school principal, informs him of his younger brother Danny's aspirations of becoming a Neo-Nazi just like Derek. He also confides in Derek that he himself used to hate white people as a youth, but he came to the realization that his racism was pointless. During perhaps the most pivotal scene in the film Sweeney asserts that Derek has spent his life pursuing answers, but Sweeney then askes Derek a question that soon changes the course of his life and future: "Has anything you've done made your life better?" This proves a turning point for Derek, who distances himself from the Aryan Brotherhood and changes his outlook on life. Lamont emerges as his only true friend in prison, going so far as to protect him from the black gangs who would have violently struck out at Derek once he left the protection of his gang.      Derek returns home to find that Danny has become a skinhead. After failing to convince Danny to leave the gang, Derek visits Alexander and informs him that he will no longer associate with him and tells him to stay away from Danny. Derek beats Cameron before leaving his office. During an ensuing confrontation, Derek's friend Seth points a gun at Derek in disgust and anger at Derek's b
