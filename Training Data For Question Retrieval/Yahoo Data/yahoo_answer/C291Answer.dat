I was sitting on santas lap and he thought I was a girl and gave me a Barbie Doll and he got you really ticked off<br>  <br>  ???????????|`|73gzvniqaa	Last year I was at a basketball game and i was talking to this super cute guy and we were gunna go to the concession stand to get some candy and i took a step and fell down the bleachers! lol it was so embarrassing, and it hurt like crap|`|bIouq64Oaa	When I was little I decided I wanted really short hair, so I got it ALL cut off. Plus, I always had to wear my older brother's had-me-downs. So when I walked into the ladies' restroom, a woman in there was like, "Honey, don't you think you need to go in the other restroom?"

I love that two people can be together, be happy and not care what others think. Personally, I have always wanted to be with someone other than the african-american men i have dated, but it never really happened. I'm currently with an african-american now and i love him. All in all, interraccial couples make me happy and i have no need to be a "hater".. let them do them!|`|AA11370204	I will say that all is good for them and I wish them Godspeed and Good Luck and a long life. There is absolutely nothing wrong with interracial dating or marriage.|`|6k5fhFyBaa	I think, "To each their own." It's not our place to judge.|`|aVZgY4S8aa	Well, I'm white (sorry, I don't like referring to myself as "Caucasian") and I have dated outside my race, but there's only certain races I would date and others I wouldn't. That's just my personal preference. As far as others go, it's their prerogative to date who they want.|`|wSYhEREjaa	I think there's nothing wrong with it. Why should someone just date inside their race? That makes no sense. I don't see anything wrong at all dating other races. I date out of my race, i usually date black and hispanic men.<br>  <br>  ?|`|EZyHOht7aa	I think they are BEAUTIFUL AND i want to cry a tear of joy|`|aBpEPOCdaa	I don't give it a second thought.  If they are a couple and happy, good for them.|`|e04025e23b950e2f3fe00c64e34a3bf1aa	Personally i don't care but can you ask a caucasian middle aged male<br>  to accept his grandchildren looking very different than he does - in the name of political correctness ? He just wants his grandkids and kids to look like him. No racism here.Many decent black parents feel the same way.<br>  Furthermore - two hormone glands calling to each other don't make a good foundation for a lifetime commitment.Ask Obama he can write a book on that.|`|jpH4IjWnaa	I'm not a biggie on interracial marriage, mainly because it will reduce diversity (the more people mix, the more that distinct races will not exist). It's really none of my business, but I'm usually not a huge supporter of it.|`|GcQl76mfaa	doesn't matter. shouldn't matter.|`|DA5ZbYjlaa	Couldn't care less.

CoRGsuN3aa	Yes well I have read that book and I think they should make it into a movie but it is kind of harsh at sometimes. I would think that the movie would be shot in a desert of some kind I guess. There would be a lot of different kinds of music in this movie if they made one. And one other thing if they made a movie out of this book, the humans would be looked at as the bad guys and like maybe also the barbarians because they steal food and they treat the souls like they are animals and maybe even worse than animals. So Im sorry if I didnt answer your question but this is my answer.|`|ZSlXrXsCaa	no bad book|`|VsamHLPOaa	Love the book, can't answer about who to play each character though. You picture each character perfectly and when the movie comes out your always disappointed. Well that's been my experience.|`|BmU1755Uaa	I read this a while back, and I'm not convinced that it would be a great movie. Harrison Ford would make a good Uncle Jeb though.|`|SHEjVIrUaa	wow i just got this book today. weridd. I think they should make a movie out of it.|`|xvT1rqasaa	i hope it gets made into a movie i love dat book XD

qif1TQtnaa	it's about the French Revolution, which occured in the 1700s. <br>  <br>  "I used to rule the world," is talking about the king of France, who was executed later in the Reign of Terror along with Robespierre. it also talks about him sweeping the streets he used to own, and having the people waiting for his head "on a silver plate".<br>  <br>  it's not about Napoleon, he was a French military leader who rose shortly after these events|`|AA11194909	i think it's about a king who's basically fallen from grace and sings about how the world is so much better now that he's no longer in power. "never an honest word, but that was when i ruled the world"|`|NmRE6VTfaa	The lyrics to "Viva la Vida" contain historical and religious references.[3] Martin has explained the song lyric "I know Saint Peter won't call my name" in an interview with Q magazine: "It's about ... You're not on the list. I was a naughty boy. It's always fascinated me that idea of finishing your life and then being analysed on it. And this idea runs throughout most religions. That's why people blow up buildings. Because they think they're going to get lots of virgins. I always feel like saying, just join a band ... That is the most frightening thing you could possibly say to somebody. Eternal damnation. I know about this stuff because I studied it. I was into it all. I know it. It's still mildly terrifying to me. And this is serious."[4] When asked about the song, bass guitarist Guy Berryman said: "It's a story about a king who's lost his kingdom, and all the album's artwork is based on the idea of revolutionaries and guerrillas. There's this slightly anti-authoritarian viewpoint that's crept into some of the lyrics and it's some of the pay-off between being surrounded by governments on one side, but also we're human beings with emotions and we're all going to die and the stupidity of what we have to put up with every day. Hence the album title."[5]<br>  Unlike the typical arrangement of Coldplay songs, in which either the piano or guitar is the prominent instrument, the track mostly consists of a string section playing the song's upbeat riff, along with a steady bass drum beat, percussion (including a timpani and a church bell), bass guitar, and Martin's vocals; there is limited use of electric guitar in the song. All the strings are arranged and performed by violinist Davide Rossi, who is also one of the main collaborators of the album.[6] Although Coldplay are widely labeled as an "alternative rock" band, "Viva la Vida"'s classical composition and historical subject matter have led to the song being labeled as "baroque pop" and "chamber pop".|`|SrgKPAGUaa	its about ripping off joe satriani who also *get this* ripped off some band from the 60's and my grandparents have record and i listened to it *coughcough* JOE SATRIANI SHOULD GET SUED ALSO *coughcough*|`|RNXmrUjBaa	I think its about someone in a high position that's falling downward.

eXJqtGYHaa	Well alot of people use picks. Some people will just strum with their thumb. The flesh. more the side of the thumb, but if you are playing a fast song, or a hardcore song.. or even if you are a beginner, I say use a pick. I wouldnt get a thick one either. They arent expensive. They are barely $25 each. I would go to Bernie'sif there is one around your area, and get a few of the 223-2040 T Guitar Pick Sizes. dont get a thin one, but don't get a thick one. Thick picks are usually used for Bass Gutiars than Electric or Acoustic. Because the Thicker the pick, the harder it is to strum up and down.|`|FY7NjgGnaa	you use your nail for a more pick like sound or you can use your "fleshy" parts of your fingers to get a muffled sound

16t0eV0Uaa	American Idol is one of the worse things to come into music ever.<br>  <br>  It would be a lot better if it made the singers write their own songs, not base them on what they look like, and based them on other things like stage presence, also it should be much more diverse, because it always seems to be the bubble gum pop princess, the "rocker" and the secretly gay skinny dude.  Its just a glamorized karaoke|`|Mx11gL67aa	Aw, I love American Idol.<br>  It's my guilty pleasure! <br>  I sure hope not, but to tell the truth, it has seemed to go downhill since Taylor Hicks won. Ugh he was terrible. <br>  And, as a hardcore Beatles fan, seeing them murder those songs last year killed me<br>  BUT I LOVE THAT SHOW :P|`|RtG5Iarbaa	This season I actually like 2 people, but of course the girl got voted off and I doubt the guys gonna do well cause they're actually good. =/<br>  <br>  The shows a total joke.|`|785d07b11864df1b07a99374609e381eaa	When did it have magic?|`|3b1f171c73bb2e24acbb7271e47a68faaa	Ya it's like any other show or fad... eventually fading out.<br>  Look at the immense popularity of "Survivor" when it made it's way onto TV years ago.... HUGELY popular and huge ratings.  Now, X years later, it's just another forgotten about reality show on Fox Reality Channel, volleying for viewers alongside Big Brother 11,  Shot at Love with Tila Tequila.  <br>   My point is, YES, Idol is on it's way out.  You cannot sustain a hit TV show of that magnitude for that many years.   Just like sequels to good movies... each one just gets worse and worse, less talented with each one.|`|MhNbaV6uaa	yeah i so know what you mean.<br>  idol is still a great show, but this season is absolutely terribe.<br>  i mean stevie wright?!<br>  that was pitiful and frankly i do not understand while she made it into the top 24 while ones better than her got cut.<br>  honestly people.<br>  don't get me wrong idol is an amazing show, but this season is in rough water so far, i honestly CAN stop watching it in the middle of the show, it's so predictable.<br>  it's jsut sad.|`|JQHOpMT4aa	I never really liked the show but the whole concept just got repetitive and even more boring after season 2. If you've heard 1 season of bad singers you've heard the rest except for William Chung, he was a rarity.|`|hmsCFQocaa	Americans Idle is a waste of time, and gives no-talent scum dogs like Ryan Seacrest and Simon Cowell a name.

You either have what it makes to be an idol or not no one can make them.  What has been produced from that show stinks in my eyes!|`|fzqMOD4Waa	To lose it's magic it in theory first must have had some, which is not exactly true.|`|AgQForcYaa	Some auditions are funny.

The turbulence is awful, and things go from bad to worse when one wing is struck by lightning. One woman in particular loses it. Screaming,she stands up in the front of the plane. "Im too young to die!" she wails. <br>  <br>  Then she yells, "Well, if Im going to die, I want my last minutes on earth to be memorable! No one has ever made me really feel like a woman! Well Ive had it! Is there ANYONE on this plane who can make me feel like a WOMAN??"<br>  <br>  For a moment there is silence. everyone has forgotten their own peril, and they all stare, riveted, at the desperate woman in the front of the plane. Then, a man stands up in the rear of the plane. "I can make you feel like a woman," he says. This tall, tanned and built guy with jet black eyes starts to walk slowly up the aisle, unbuttoning his shirt one button at a time. <br>  <br>  No one moves. As this man approaches, the woman begins to get excited. He removes his shirt. Muscles ripple across his chest as he reaches her, and extends the arm holding his shirt to the trembling woman, and says: "Iron this."|`|Q5eckzbraa	Dear Dad: <br>  It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you.<br>  I had to <br>  elope with my new girlfriend because I wanted to avoid a scene with mom <br>  and you.<br>  <br>  I have been finding real passion with Stacy and she is so nice.<br>  But <br>  I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing, tattoos, <br>  tight motorcycle clothes and the fact that she is much older than I am.<br>  <br>  But it's not only the passion...Dad she's pregnant.<br>  Stacy said that we will <br>  be very happy.<br>  She owns a trailer in the woods and has a stack of firewood <br>  for the whole winter.

vtiea9eTaa	Hmm, tough question. I would rate it exactly at 5.72. People need to be physically attracted to their special someone but I also think once you get to know the person and who they really are ...... their personality, honesty, compassion, trustworthiness, dependability,  ........ those factors also contribute in a positive or negative way to their attractiveness. = )|`|DooqYRfAaa	Looks are important to some degree, but it's not most important overriding everything else.  On a scale of 1-10 I'd rate looks to be 6.5,  only because I can't decide whether looks is a 6 or 7.  Anyway, there needs to be some degree of attraction, he needs to turn me on, and make me melt.  But one thing for sure, looks without smarts is a total turn off for me because smarts (brains) to me is totally sexy.  I love having stimulating conversations, I love knowing he is smart, I love knowing he can teach me things, and I just love knowing we connect intellectually as well as physically and emotionally.|`|6YyeqVMQaa	3<br>  looks r only important in the sense that i don't want 2 be w/ someone that i find incredibly unattractive. but as long as he's average looking at least it's fine. basically, as long as he isn't horribly disfigured it's fine.|`|uqMK3rUZaa	They help, but they're certainly not the most important thing. Character is much more important. :o)|`|AA10482538	As much as I would like to say I could marry Igor if he was really sweet....the fact is looks are important. I would rate them on a 7. Why? Because for me sex is also important. Looks and sex are not everything, but I would say they are 50% for me. The other 50% is character, trustworthiness, love, loyalty, sense of humor, ethics, dependability etc etc. :-)|`|T7ANno5Qaa	A 3 or 4.<br>  Love from the heart and soul is the most important. In fact, looks don't matter. It's what is in the inside, remember?<br>  When you look at someone, in the eyes, you can tell if it is love at first sight.<br>  But who cares about looks? Would you date a buff guy who's totally hot but only knows that the sky is blue?|`|vzZ7rJJcaa	I'd have to say about a 3...if I were to go out and look for someone, I would be looking for LOOKS ONLY but I don't work that way.

XggC5e9Aaa	I have gone behind the scenes several times and went to camp at SeaWorld San Diego a while ago. The animals are treated extremely well. Each animal is given a medical check every single day and are fed the correct amount of food for their diet. The enclosed areas the animals are contained in are cleaned just about everyday, meaning the tanks have extremely good filter systems and water is pumped in from Mission Bay. Fresh fish is brought in every day. <br>  <br>  And the behaviors and shows they train the animals for. Yeah, most are unnatural, but the animals are not being forced to do the behavior. They are simply being asked. If they don't want to perform a behavior, the trainers won't let them then. I don't think you would want to force an 8,000-10,000 pound killer whale to perform a behavior that they do not want to do at the moment.<br>  <br>  Most of the animals there are not from the wild. Just the oldies, who do really enjoy living there =) (Like Corky 2, the oldest orca alive in captivity, age of 43). Each animal gets along well with eachother and with their trainers. SeaWorld does not take an animal out of captivity and keep them in the park, unless the animal will not be able to cope with being released back to survive in the wild. <br>  <br>  But to think of it, SeaWorld will never capture wild animals and throw them into captivity and train them, like how they were back when SeaWorld first opened. All animals in today time at the parks are born in the parks, and are treated with great respect. They are not thrown in there, or being locked up. If an animal is sick, anything is done to get the animal back to health.|`|c964ee3e3e4f130e002bec2269a9860caa	They must b missing their real world,but they are better in the aquarium because outside,in the wild,they are in danger.<br>  Did you watch Happy Feet?

I think I would be exhausted, and wanting terribly to live free in an open ocean or something. <br>  <br>  And yes, they are quite majestic aren't they?|`|e2cf497fb8528f8c556d43e9580066c5aa	I dont think so. <br>  Obviously theyre gonna put up a video of happy images.<br>  Imagine someone locked you up in your room for the rest of your life.|`|e04025e23b950e2f3fe00c64e34a3bf1aa	They say - they treat the animals with kindness, But i hear those dolphins have a much shorter lifespan than in the wild.|`|zRlDQ9JJaa	I went there when I was 7 (very long time ago) I touched a dolphin there and a starfish too! they looked kinda happy but it's more like an aquarium over there|`|m4KogcJoaa	Even if they were "free" they would only stay in one general area and they wouldn't have food handed to them everyday...so, I'm pretty sure that they are happy|`|8zJy3jeOaa	I dont think so. they are all programmed to think that they are happy. I feel really bad for them to be quite honest.

AA11111233	If Jack did find the wineglasses and all the other evidence, then yes, he suspects that the Shilly thing happened, but is not going to come out with it right now.  Nick may have remembered their non-existant wedding anniversary, but Sharon was not up for romance, mad at him for choosing Phyllis over ten years that meant nothing to her.  So she's in a very fragile state right now.  *Rolls eyes* I think that if Jack brings up his suspicions, Sharon will get all whiney and defensive and blame everything about her meltdown on Nick going back to the so-called slut who stole him away from her.  I think he's just waiting for her to let it all out.<br>  <br>  [/sarcasm]|`|msUIsv8maa	Jack has really been supportive of Sharon|`|5f0111f71db8592710a5d1cb4897be4aaa	Absolutely.... as soon as he saw that wine glass tucked into the night stand and after seeing how bad Billy hurt ( hangover ) I think he suspects it !!! Hell... he knows his wife and how she takes her troubles away > nothing beats a roll in the hay for Sharon to feel better <|`|b637df4c5d99edf4bd75147b1fdb49d3aa	I think that he suspects that she slept with someone, but he hasn't figured out that it's Billy.<br>  <br>  But let's face it...Sharon is a slut.  She has more nut in her than in a snicker bar.|`|4kuWOZowaa	I think he suspects it..cant wait till he find out. Ehhhhhh so much drama lol|`|fcPiQDwEaa	Yes! But it's if he can come to term with it.|`|AA11952412	Just because two people have a hangover on the same morning doesn't mean that they drank together or anything else.  Jack is still legally Sharon's husband, and I am sure he would rather wonder why paint takes forever to dry than to wonder if his own brother would be his wife.  What I really would like to know is why both Sharon and Billy were at the Athletic Club - don't they both still reside with Jack at the Abbott house?|`|KZV8p4PGaa	He definitely is not going to be too happy.  All he needs to do is remember the scent of the perfume and he will definitely link those to together.  They are making Billy be a real slime ball.  I do not remember him being like this when he was younger, but they always try to play it like he was a player.  Anyways the bad part is I can see Jack being really angry with Billy, but able to forgive Trampy Sharon.|`|rYA2KCnUaa	I think he is starting to put two and two together because he saw the second champagne bottle that was hidden in the drawer. Jack is not dumb, he is going to find sooner or later, the funny part about is that Sharon is divorcing him and he really can not so anything about it.|`|iqo4KdCZaa	Yesss! Just the face he made when he saw the hidden wine glass. The wine bottle was empty and usually its shared with two people. He had just saw Billy looking like crap, now Sharon?? It's just a small town so he could put 2 and 2 together. Sharon is such a freaking HOE!|`|Jy9KORHDaa	He knows! Jack knows they were both drunk and he found the extra glass, he is a lousy husband and businessman but he isn't dumb|`|lv1dT7BQaa	Im sure Jack recognized the cologne Billy had on him.|`|EPPb5pRBaa	He knows Sharon was not alone,but i don't think he knows it was Billy.

b5ff1a7351518399ad114718fdc0a8f3aa	i would have probably given the film a very average score. I think it leaps out as a complete money making fest, and despite any money going towards the families of victims, completely inappropriate. Not everyone linked to such a disaster would have been too happy about it, especially given the short time between the real disaster and this sole money making cinema outing. I think they should have waited at least 10 years to even consider such a movie, especially considering the scale with the number of deaths that were involved. Many people were no doubt still grieving when it was released. You cant please everybody, and giving to the charity was a good thing, but i still dont think it should ever have been made, when comparing to the amount of money the actors and movie makers involved would have made themselves.|`|s3QWedUFaa	i think it is **** and inappropriate.|`|0IG3lEpaaa	Is this a homework question?|`|6KUWGCAmaa	b|`|CLHhhU5waa	two thumbs down. probably a government movie project, with views the government wants to portray.

sc4BtGxGaa	Your link does not work, but I know what you are talking about. Puccini often used this type of parallelism.  For the pop music folks peeking over our shoulder - consider the last 3 chords in the phrase ending of Lady Madonna by the Beatles.  Besides that horn line - the fundamental harmony is:  I   IV   I  IV  I   IV bVI   bVII   I.  In the key of C , - that's C - F  C- F C -F  Ab Bb C.  Also used in some gospel stuff.  After being slaves to the Leading Tone, the adoption of the quasi-primitivism of parallel construction must have sounded strange, yet compelling.  You also get it in Butterfly ( don't ask me where - wine with dinner . . ) and after all those Paris Exposition and World's Fair introductions to music of other cultures - we got LOTS of additives to our otherwise uptight post-Romantic chromatic harmony.  <br>  <br>  So - I hear you about the upper tetrachord being minor - but it's not really - it is MAJOR chords, but based on lowered 6, lowered 7 - therefore, the parallel MAJOR chords relentlessly rolling home - and no traditional 7-1 leading tone.  That's my take - your mileage may vary.|`|CrAwmz65aa	Sorry to hog 2 points for this, but Mamianka doesn't allow e-mail:<br>  Mamianka, where is that passage?<br>  I have a score for Tosca and I want to mark it.|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	mmm....this is the one Puccini opera where you genuinely feel the influence of Wagner , I don't mean the leitmotifs so much as the harmony, which seems to have that restless tension in it...then again I could be going mad...it's a nice time of year for it.|`|uahXvRSmaa	to suhwahaksaeng-<br>  <br>  the section is at the end of Act II, after Tosca kills Scarpia. She says a few lines to the effect of "you're dead" and then the strings come in playing a mournful theme. It's the mournful theme that the questioner was asking about. I don't have the score so I can't give you a bar number, but hopefully you can figure it out.<br>  <br>  btw- that has to be one of the coolest uses of opera in a movie. Not the best bond movie, though not bad either, but the Tosca scene is amazing.

Bdgza4G2aa	My personal favorites are Boogiepop Phantom, Paranoia Agent, and Akira. I really like psychological anime, although Akira is science fiction.|`|W7mmL7Wyaa	Death Note. :)|`|zhL83fSlaa	I have so many favorites, but at the moment I'm really into Sailor Moon.|`|bZsF1n0zaa	My favorite anime/manga ever is One Piece!!!<br>  <br>  You know that there are thousands of anime out there. But only a few make it. ex. One Piece, Bleach, Naruto, Death Note, Elfen Lied, etc etc.  It is because they are original and unique and stand out from all the others. They are what people want. But I think One Piece exceeds the expectations of anime fans. It is more than people ask for, better than they expect. It is just amazing in my opinion.<br>  <br>  <br>  They story is so original. The theme of Pirates is something that is never used often so it is unique. The character development is incredible. All the characters are different in their own way. They have different fighting styles, different personalities, different looks. Luffy is kinda the main character but everyone else in his crew gets equal time to speak and act. It is not all about Luffy. Everyone gets to be part of the story, no one is left behind. <br>  <br>  The story is never repetitive and although it's very long, it has never shown signs of being dragged on like many other anime. The mangaka, Oda, the creater of One Piece is a genious. His mind is so unpredictable. That's why i love One Piece, it's so unpredictable! I always try to guess what the outcome of something is going to be and I feel like I am right but I hardly ever am and what Oda actually reveals is way better than what I had imagined.<br>  <br>  Overall it is my favorite anime/manga everr out of all the anime/manga that i've seen. It stand out so much to me. I think it's the perfect anime for me! And for many other people. If it wasn't for One Piece, I wouldn't really care for anime so much. But One Piece is so amazing to me, I want it to last forever. It's just plain awesome!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  ~~(^__^)~~|`|ob2VmCEgaa	naruto|`|MZFIJf1zaa	Code Geass|`|Gi9sz9ataa	ToraDora!<br>  Hayate no Gotoku<br>  Shakugan no Shana<br>  Zero no Tsukaima!<br>  <br>  lol all tsundere animes. very amusing and funny.

rRCTvT7Saa	Most signature models aren't really built to the same exact specs as the artist that supposedly use them, yet the prices are high for the name of the artist!<br>  <br>  However, there are a few artists, such as bassist Billy Sheehan, who do use instruments that are regular models that anyone can buy (not a signature model, that is).<br>  <br>  Also, country guitarist Brad Paisley uses mainly Fender Teles but also uses Crook Custom Guitars.  Crooks are built to the specs of anyone who orders one.  In fact, all Crooks are custom-made and they're very nice, but quite expensive!<br>  <br>  Anyway, I doubt that any guitarists who have signature models will actually use the ones normal people can buy in stores!  I mean, why would they when they could afford ANY guitar with any features they want?|`|AA11618843	It's hard to say for sure, but I do read articles about guitarists' gear and a lot of them change the pickups instead of using what the original off the shelf guitars use. I've also read about shaving the neck, putting on different size frets, changing the tuners and even having chambers cut into the body for weight or sound differences. I still think most of the pros could use an off the shelf guitar and get great results, but they are professional and know what they're doing.|`|Xl82sK4haa	Eric Clapton, though he had played Fender Telecasters and Jazzmasters in his brief career with The Yardbirds, would attain "guitar god" status while playing models such as the Gibson Les Paul, Firebird, ES-335 and SG whilst a member of Cream. <br>  <br>  However, in 1970, for his landmark Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs with a new band, Derek and the Dominos, Clapton switched to a tobacco sunburst Stratocaster from 1956, nicknamed "Brownie". This was in part due to the influence of his former Blind Faith bandmate Steve Winwood. <br>  <br>  He later assembled the best parts of three mid-'50s Strats to create his favorite guitar, the famous "Blackie", a black composite Stratocaster which he played for many years.

CnwNrGlKaa	Ok, this is funny i am also trying to decide between a lucille and sheraton. let me give u some facts about the two i have picked from the hundreds of videos ive watched and the thousands of things ive read. 1. The sheraton as you know is a semi hollow electric. It has two f holes on the top, dont buy it because of how good it looks with these like i nearly did. You said that you play a lot of metal and alternative. I found out that with gain/distortion through a semi hollow, feedback can result. Now trust me you do not want feedback. 2. Because it is a semi hollow it doesnt have an axcess panel in the back. that simply means that if the input jack loosens and falls inside the guitar, like it did to someone on yahoo answers, you will have to manoevere through the f holes to fix it. 3. Basically any modifications to the electronics will have to be done through the f holes because there are no access panels. <br>  That was the negatives , the positives are that of any semi hollow. <br>  Now here is my recommendation.<br>  The epiphone lucille or bb king lucille has no f holes, like bb king wanted. This reduces feedback so you can play with more distortion. Also if something becomes loose or you want to modify the electronics there is an axcess panel in the back. 3 The lucille unlike the sheraton has a varitone switch with 6 settings. Each one increases the frequency of the sound produced, hence causing a higher tone. Using this you can get anywhere between a humbucker sound,(what it comes with) or a single coil pickup tune. Since you want a variety of tones this might be better to get. On the bad side of the lucille ( for you maybe, i love this) it only comes in black, with an elegant white binding on the top, back of the body, on the neck and headstock. I love it.<br>  So the choice is yours, those are the main features of both. Failing you dont understand what i said, especially if ur a newbie, then go to guitarcenter and try both out. I will probably get a lucille cos i constantly fiddle and modify my guitars so the access panel is for me especially since i dont want to stick my fingers through the f hole. If you need any quick and when i say quick i mean within a day, help then create an account on <a href="http://forums.epiphone.com" rel="nofollow">http://forums.epiphone.com</a> and ask me directly. I always check my account so i can help you within an hour or two ( i am telling you this because you mentioned a sale deadline and yahoo answers can be very unhelpful at times) right so on the forums go to epiphone electrics and you will see a lot there or you can search for me ( name is slasher1319 ) and post a message in my inbox) if you have any problem in deciding i suggest posting in my inbox directly and you will have an answer. my screen name is all common letters. If you dont need any more help then good luck with ur new guitar. Oh yea and more importantly the cost of the sheraton and lucille is the same $699.

The interior is redone to match in black and gold, with the gold as tuck & roll inserts on the black seats. It might be lowered some, too.

IxLj8bBZaa	The song title is "Falling" by Iration. It was easy to search for those lyrics on Google and find the downloadable song.<br>  <br>  The song is on their EP called "Sample This":<br>  <a href="http://www.junodownload.com/products/1358520-02.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.junodownload.com/products/135...</a><br>  <br>  On the band's blog, they discuss putting the song on an upcoming album:<br>  <a href="http://irationmusic.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://irationmusic.blogspot.com/</a><br>  <br>  (I like Converse Hi-Tops--that's how I found your question by accident!)

xTioPxaVaa	For an electric guitar, you're looking at replacing the bridge with one that has a piezo-electric element in it.  You'll also have to add an onboard preamp to make it work properly.  Then, there's the question of how to combine the output from your magnetic pickups, or do you route the signals to individual outputs.  And if you're guitar has a tremolo system on it (Floyd Rose), it will have to be replaced and the body filled to accomodate the new bridge.  You're probably looking at 200-300 dollars to do something like this, plus the cost of the bridge.<br>  <br>  You're probably better off at looking at another guitar.  I know that Schecter has several models that have piezo bridges (I've got a C1-E/A, and it's quite good).  There are also some Epiphone Les Pauls now that have what they call a Nano-Mag pickup on them.  It's a different take on the acoustic-sound-from-an-electric thing.  I haven't heard it personally, but it looks interesting.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, TX
54aec0bc2f9af8beb26e9a78a5518ba8aa	It's Keith Urban's tour...he's the headliner, Taylor is the opening act.  Since she's a fairly famous singer, she may do a set longer than 30 minutes, but I'd say 45 minutes tops.  Keith Urban is a great performer, and even if you don't like him now...that will definitely not be the case once you leave a concert of his.  He puts on the best live performance I have ever seen.  Better than Kenny Chesney, Brad Paisley, Carrie Underwood...and yes, Taylor Swift.  You definitely will not be disappointed and it is definitely worth your $$$.|`|JYVuP6C5aa	:O  ah.  my heart just broke in to an million pieces here.  keith urban is an amazing performer. i think you'd have a lot of fun at that concert.  because taylor swift is amazing, and the two of them together would create so much energy, it would be hard to stand it. <br>  <br>  but anyway.. i don't want to sound like i'm forcing you to go to a keith urban concert, so i'll actually answer your question now.<br>  <br>  i think it would be an even amount of songs played by each, and they'll do duets together.|`|c35ba196c90007a5362149af2acc4ed7aa	Keith is the main guy for sure
M9UGK0Roaa	There may be nudie type pictures on the wall in David's place (such as a woman bending over, seen from the side), but they're so small and seen from such a distance that no details can be noted. And there is one scene where a man and a women go into sex and get on top of each other and the man puts his hand up the womens skirt but after that they stop and nothing is shown.<br>  <br>  After his clothes are torn by his enlargement as the Hulk, Bruce is seen nude from the rear, both while as the Hulk and as normal. This is only one scene, however. <br>  <br>  P.S: IMDB has a parental guide, I'm including the link bellow.|`|Kq1QPgZyaa	Its been a while since I saw it, but I remember that there was one part where the Hulk gets in a fight with these mutated dogs that went after his girlfriend.  During the fight, the dogs rip his shorts off.  It's dark and shady when it happens though, so he's still concealed, even after he becomes human again.<br>  <br>  That's all I can think of.

wWXon8Zsaa	Demi Lovato:  On Sonny With A Chance, she is just full of enthusiasm, and everyone hates her but she just tries to think positive all the time and makes the best of whatever situation she is in. She wants to be friends with everyone, she is always nice to everyone even when they are all ganging up on her and I think that she is a great role model for kids on Sonny With A Chance it's a great show.|`|IGQw4267aa	my role models are christina aguilera and sonny moore.|`|vnzSTerjaa	paul walker, all guys should aspire to be that hot :D<br>  <br>  <a href="http://bestof.provocateuse.com/images/photos/paul_walker_99.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://bestof.provocateuse.com/images/ph...</a>|`|gPoVQpt0aa	NONE.

zZ3Uxllfaa	that was really harsh and she had a mean look on her face when she said it , at least jase is fair and gives credit where credits due , she even got her name wrong and called her Zoe  ffs|`|6b8e59fd2fd02ff0fc91538b71ecd4d8aa	I think she said something like  ''you just don't do it for me''  --   i thought it was unnecessary to say the least. Ruthie is getting ideas above her station on DOI - she's been put on a judging panel and  as she said knows nothing about skating until she went with her children to an ice rink last week!!|`|0789e50a1396d5b6b9138ceaad0e64f5aa	Absolutely disgusting H - she was actually saying she doesn't like her so how bloody unprofessional is that, especially when she said she watches Daniel rather than her.  She is supposed to be judging her skating not her personality or perving after Daniel!  She isn't even a skater anyway!|`|aKhZNd7daa	In a word H - Shite !!!  And she knows exactly WHAT about Skating Manoeuvres ??|`|bNllesmMaa	I didn't think she needed to tell her that she didn't like her.  I mean come on, be professional about it.  She also called her Zoe, whats with the women.  She doesn't even skate, so who is she to judge!<br>  I personally got the feeling that Ruthie felt that roxy reminds her of her once younger self.  Ruthie is no spring chicken, so is kind of jealous.  It's just a theory I have.|`|ZvxyqG3Paa	ignore   ruthie  .  she   is   just   trying    to   be     like    jason  .<br>     but   i  think    jason    is   honest  &   funny  .   which   ruthie   is   not  .  <br>     i   think   ruth   knew    what   she   said    when   she   called   roxy .   zoe  <br>    just   another   way   of    being    nasty   to    roxy  .  <br>     <br>  she   said    she   doesnt   like   roxy  /   maybe   shes   jealous    of   all    the   attention   roxy   gets   ,|`|jw72N1moaa	I didn't see what she said to her, what did she say? To be honest, I hate Ruthie, she knows nothing. I would love to see her trying to do what the contestants do.|`|DtU1EpoVaa	she is just rude there was no need for that comment and call her Zoe was just un called for she knew how she was watching dancing.|`|aGwjf2y4aa	i agree with her she just dosent do anything wow or seem to improve she always plays it safe|`|tE7lqUfoaa	Omg I'm watching her dance right now LOL<br>  Il be back in a second LOL<br>  <br>  <br>  ***** LOL|`|5291a9a99454d23e77cfc29e0c5f7e95aa	she was rude to Roxy i dint no why she is a judge|`|lReSpTijaa	What a *****, & she couldn't even get the bloody name right ffs.|`|92hLSlJcaa	She's a total twonk! How ignorant to call Roxy "Zoe". And as for "finding herself watching Daniel"- she's there to judge the celebs NOT the bloody professionals, so she should just get on with the job.|`|soBqLlNAaa	I don't like Ruthie, she is all smarmy over Zoe and her mind is so full of Zoe that she even called Roxy by the wrong name - even the apology didn't come across as genuine<br>  <br>  ~x~|`|jipqICzVaa	She's really bitchy isn't she. There was no need for that. I think it's jealousy myself, cos Roxanne's younger and prettier.|`|AA10077992	I thought she had bloody cheek - Ruthie, like Jason has never skated and Roxanne is really trying hard. <br>  I'm beginning to think that Kerry Katona will be a better bet !

Glad she went as I think she is too up herself and I have never liked her anyway lol!|`|Um8osMNuaa	l'd have gone more for a bit wooden, but prosthetic describes them so much better!|`|6d10196c158f49dbb02649f8773591d0aa	Pmlrof he was spot on there again prosthetic pml I am with Gart do not like her or Roxey woman|`|aKhZNd7daa	Errrrr I think he could of been right H !!!
axdZHDRqaa	I really want her to! She was great in Mamma Mia and Doubt! I have a feeling Kate Winslet will since she won all those Golden Globes (but no one cares about the Golden Globes, right?)<br>  <br>  EDIT: Turns out Kate Winslet did win, oh well, maybe next year for Meryl! Still, congrats to Kate and all the other nominees for best actress!!<br>  <br>  :)|`|5f930dd66cfee7f04720c41de82939d8aa	She's up for Doubt, I think.  I saw the movie and while she was very good, it wasn't her best, nor was the movie.  She was far better in The Devil Wore Prada.  Both movies were not worth seeing.  Why doesn't she pick more oscar worthy roles?  Those movies got a nod because she was in them.  She is excellent but I don't see movies because she is in them because I basically don't like what she chooses to do.  I really want to see The Reader.  I've been reading a bit about the Nazi's and that could be one heck of a role.  And what's her face is good competition for Meryl.|`|FXzlmEhWaa	I want her to win too! She's such an amazing actress.|`|var2c8zVaa	yea shes amazing|`|Xkas9BG2aa	Yep...she is a great actress.  She's really had 15 nominations?!  Wow!  Though she might be the greatest American actress of all time.  What I like about her is that she keeps reinventing herself.  Her roles are so diversified.  I haven't seen her in the movie 'Doubt' that she's nominated in but have seen the trailers and having been raised Catholic, I find her believable in the role of a nun.  Haven't seen that many movies so don't know who she's up against....the best of luck to all the nominees.|`|Y39y6vayaa	Im sure she will. She is an amazing actress and i think that 15 noms is ALOT lol. But yeahh she deserves it!

TrQ7auS1aa	Actually it is unfair and that is only shown by the movie.........the movie states that the kids who live in slums r no better treated then a dog.........the hero jamal(dev patel) is treted like that only.........firstly he is brutally beaten by an indian ,,,,then anilkapor the host of the show puts him in the jail,,,,,,then the police officer tortures him like a dog an all the incidents take place just bcoz he was a person who lives in slum......<br>  this movie exactly shows that only the people who live in slums r forced to adopt illegal occupations bcoz the world does not accept them and treats them like a dog|`|yENww2b0aa	yeh i agree,and if youve watched the movie, dont u think anil kapoor was being quite harsh towards that boy. he was very rude!|`|TuGkVqwraa	Yeah. even I too have same feeling as you do.|`|uFaCT7keaa	sure it is<br>  but this will show those jealous americans even the movie titled as slumdog has won highest no of award which is a big success|`|70d867ec0ce9c05d098a7efb66f7d809aa	The government of the country needs to take them out the slums, then they wont be called "SLUM-DOGS"|`|R9nfrBGPaa	yeah but its just a term, not to disrespect anyone. like we say "lucky dog"|`|d41e08bb3751292a4ef4365282a8edb2aa	I'm sure that Indians have called people in the slums "slumdogs", but it automatically becomes an issue when the white people start calling people in the slums "slumdogs".

vDGFRACaaa	The plural of fish is fish. Not fishes.<br>  <br>  The fish that live in aquariums are bred specifically to live in aquariums. They have never lived in the ocean. (Which makes the start of 'Finding Nemo' completely ridiculous.)<br>  <br>  So whether you buy them or not, they will live in a small glass cage and will die in several months. You can choose to adopt them and give them the best life possible, or you can leave them and hope somebody nice adopts them.<br>  <br>  (Personally I found fish so depressing that I never refilled my tank after the first batch "passed on".)|`|UwEEHuRcaa	Nobody knows. However they have food and no predators, you'd think they'd be happy. If they survive a longish time then that shows they are pretty stress-free. If they were stressed they'd die.|`|Rc9SNllPaa	Sorry Medo. I can't remember being a fish, so I can't tell you what it's like. But I don't think it's natural for a fish to be stuck in a tank for it's entire life. It's a bit like us being stuck in the house for 70 years.<br>  I never think that we have the right to restrict other living beings of any kind in any way at all.<br>  Take care and best wishes always.<br>  GOURANGA GOURANGA GOURANGA<br>  <br>  Your friend Gora|`|kd2c9BMeaa	they are opressed|`|a7JOKn5Jaa	i honestly think soo<br>  all mine would jump out the tank <br>  for som reason<br>  = [

Yt4a21Nsaa	I THINK I WANT TO BE A WRITER IS IT NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE OR THE LANGUAGE YOU ARE SPEAKING TO BE A GOOD WRITER?  I know a few words but i think punctuation is overrated!|`|hJP9y6kjaa	YES.... and anyone who tells you differently is in denial.<br>  <br>  If you want to be a professional musician, ie do studio work for commercials and fill-in work for bands etc etc, then often all you're given is a list of chords, and you'll be expected to play it, play it well, usually on the first or second take. If you don't know chords then you *can't* do professional work like this.<br>  <br>  To be an artist per se, then you will still need to know your shiz... chords are the harmony to a song, and are the backdrop against which you play your melodies. If you don't know how to formulate the background harmony, then how will you create your music?<br>  <br>  Even if you're just playing piano and do everything by ear... music theory helps inform you what notes will sound good together, and how to tell other musicians what you're playing. If you say to another musician "this song is in the key of Bb minor" then they'll know what chords you're going to be using, for the most part. If you have no idea what key you're playing in, or what chords you're using, it will make it very difficult for other players (bassists, other guitarists, hell even backup singers) to play along with you.<br>  <br>  That said, many players got by with *minimal* knowledge... Slash was entirely self-taught, for instance, as were so many of the early blues players. But you can never be a truly great artist without either being born with some freaky talent for it, or without studying your music theory... Satriani, Vai, etc etc are masters not because they sat around for hours screwing around, but because they studied *how* music works, and *why* (which is what music theory is), then took that knowledge and ran with it (and practiced their heinies off).<br>  <br>  Chords are simply two or more notes played at the same time. Some of the more complex chords take a little getting used to... but if you stumble across a combination of notes (ie a chord) that sound good together, wouldn't it be nice to figure out a) what they are and b) when you can use them so they "fit in" with everything else?<br>  <br>  Say you have a riff that uses the notes A, B, F#, and G. Knowing that this series of notes belong in either a single or double sharp key signature (and therefore in the keys of G major, E minor, D major, or B minor) means you'll know that it won't fit well into a key signature with a flat in it (ie key of F major / D minor ).<br>  <br>  <br>  Can you see how this could save you a lot of time? That's why its good to know chords, and to know at least a little bit of music theory.<br>  <br>  <br>  Saul|`|lgMshdofaa	well no, but it is a good idea to learn chords because, then you have higher chances of succeeding as a musician ....and it will be easier to write music if you know your chords.<br>  Hope this helps, Indy|`|CKbgrp9xaa	If you can play the notes that's all that matters. I have played the guitar since i was six and only know one cord Im sure your a great musician so keep working and eventually no one will know that you don't know cords

24UPDIBTaa	Stranded (a link to buy the DVD below) was Survivor Man's beginning:<br>  <br>  In August of 2001, while you all were enjoying a barbeque out back or relaxing in the sun, the award winning, highly acclaimed show @Discovery Canada (now Daily Planet) sent Les out to the remote bush of the Canadian boreal forest to survive alone for seven days. Les was hundreds of kilometers from the nearest person or settlement without food, tent, matches, or equipment. With just two cameras, the items any person might have in their pockets and his wits he had to deal with the intense bugs and the hottest week on record! He had to find food, shelter, water and make a fire without matches! There was no camera crew, no million dollar prize and no one to vote off the island! Les set the record straight for an audience obsessed with Hollywood notions on how to survive in the wilderness. The result, other than Les still being alive, was a hugely popular five-part mini series which was reformatted into a one hour special. A web site based on the series quickly became one of Discovery Channel's most popular and even surpassed the Crocodile Hunter web site for popularity. <br>  <br>  Then he did it again, at the dead of winter! At the end of January when southern Ontario had a balmy plus 15 degree C. heat wave, Les endured temperatures of minus 41 degrees C. for an entire week alone. His only comfort was a shelter under a tree and a small fire started by striking rock against steel. He had an axe and one energy bar per day for food.

0789e50a1396d5b6b9138ceaad0e64f5aa	I agree with you but at least we knew that Jessica would be kept in over Melinda.  So glad Melinda went as she is so big headed, I really do not like her and her skating was not 'all that'!!  Coleen has a big fan base because she appears daily on 'Loose Women' but I think she is now the worse skater and should go next week.  She probably won't though!|`|aKhZNd7daa	Colleen - Sorry all The Loose Women Fans !!  She's shite but because on national TV nearly 5 days a week she gets through.  Wtf  !!|`|AA10077992	If you keep voting for Jessica then she will stay in. I voted for Ray and he's still there !<br>  I thought Colleen should have been in the skate-off and possibly Donal|`|FcHplZtQaa	Totally ridiculous, poor Melinda stood no chance!|`|l9biq5kVaa	Couldnt believe Jessica Taylor was in the skate-off when that heffalump Coleen Nolan managed to get through. I think she's funny and she obviously has her fans, and yes she's 'heftier' and older than the others but its not about 'who's not doing too bad despite their age/weight - it IS supposed to be about who progresses and improves their skating, which she definitaly is not doing as well as the others.  To get through because her Loose Women fans are voting for her is getting beyond a joke. Its all very well saying the judges have the final vote, but when they're voting for at least one person who shouldnt have been there at all then its defeating the whole point of the show. At this rate its going to be a final between Ray and Colleen! Daft!|`|Um8osMNuaa	l'd have thought it would be Melinda and Donal in the skate off. <br>  No way should it have been Jessica, she's been good all the way through and improves all the time. <br>  l like Colleen, she's not a good skater, but she's fun, she always enjoys it and must be very popular to keep getting through.<br>  l think the right one went tonight, as Jason said her legs are like prosthetics, she is a little stiff!|`|bNllesmMaa	I am suprised about that, I would of said it was between either Melinda and Donal.  Because not many people had heard of Donal, and he was in the first skate off.  I am glad he stayed though, as there is something really nice about him.  He is also really improving every week.|`|cvjPQ9tTaa	Jessica shouldn't be in the skate off<br>  Roxanne should have gone...|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	No, it's  a public vote and the public like colleen|`|AS4pWko5aa	colleen has plenty of fans , colleen is a bit older than the other girls and is doing well <br>  <br>  at least melinda and her mad cheesy grin are in the skate off , some justice

Right click on it, and put show hidden all files (hidden). ask if that doesnt work. but when you open it, you should be able to see a somewhat transparent file saying songs, or along the lines of that. select it, there should be several folders, when you open them, there should be audio files but their names are different, COPY all the songs and put them in a folder on your desktop. then SELECT ALL and drag over into itunes library. this should work, if not look up "find hidden files ipod" on youtube or in google, and that should put you in the right direction.|`|CMpVtP92aa	Transfer iPod/iPhone/iTouch apps to computer or recover lost or missing music, backup and restore all of iPod/iPhone/iTouch content I recommend you Cucusoft iPhone/iTouch/iPod to Computer Transfer.

tLI94qWNaa	Yes, there were many other wars and genocides. I dont really know why they are not talked about as much, for example the Armenian Genocide.|`|kFHwzBG7aa	Yes there were many.  But few were as bad as the holocaust, in terms of number of people killed, how badly they were tortured, how long it lasted, and how Hitler was able to influence so many people into taking part in something so blantantly wrong.  They were able to pull this off and fight a war with half the world at the same time.<br>  <br>  Also, movies have only been around since like the 30's, and this one is the most recent so we have the most information to tell a clearer story.  Also, I think most Americans would rather just not think about what the settlers did to the natives here, especially considering the fact was the only compensation they got was some casinos in the desert.  Hollywood can sell a holocaust movie, but how many people would buy a movie about the Trail of Tears?

The season was filmed at the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising,[6] and filming concluded on Friday, October 17, 2008.[7] Finalists are showing their collections at New York Fashion Week this month.[8] The Fashion Week runway finale will be filmed at Bryant Park on February 20, 2009, at 9:00AM but the finalist designers' names will be withheld from the audience and thus their identities will be kept secret until the intended future airing of the sixth season of the contested show.[9]<br>  <br>  The sixth season had been announced to begin airing in January 2009 on Lifetime, but this did not occur. The announcement occurred before NBC Universal sought preliminary injunctive action effectively enjoining production. The launch may be further delayed due to Lifetime's request that the suit between NBC Universal and The Weinstein Co. be moved to a federal court.[10][11][12] As of January 30, 2009, the court case is still in state court, with no trial date set.[13]<br>  <br>  The season six Project Runway show at Bryant Park occurred February 19, 2009. Only three designers showed collections, and the designers did not appear onstage in order to protect their identities.[14]|`|iIaZ5oSqaa	it premires at 2 30 in the morning at my house.|`|oKRyQIumaa	There is no certain that has been established yet because of the channel switch but it should be soon because filming was concluded last fall!

And Out Come the Wolves" album) and Flogging Molly (Drunken Lullabies, Rebels of the Sacred Heart, Seven Deadly Sins [right title?], etc).<br>  <br>  I really like Death (Pull the Plug, the Philosopher, etc etc), Fear Factory (anything from Obsolete or earlier, ie Edgecrusher, Resurrection, etc)....<br>  <br>  There's a lot of good music out there, and I haven't even gotten into the stuff I like but don't listen to that often...<br>  <br>  <br>  Saul|`|5db3c4461a8769be72004e1e576d5a19aa	Well, I like a lot of the stuff you like....So, some other music I like are The Cure(Just Like Heaven, Friday), They Might Be Giants (Sorry, no song recommendations, but they're a good band, not many people know about them, and they have a different, fun vibe thing), U2(all of 'em!), The Beatles (they're a classic), Counting Crows(Round Here, Mr. Jones), R.E.M.(It's the End of The World as We Know It, Losing My Religion), The Frames (Falling Slowly, Revelation), Tears For Fears (Shout, Head Over Heals, Everybody Wants to Rule the World), and Oasis(Wonderwall, Don't Look Back in Anger).<br>  <br>  Anywho, I hope that helps!

GCSFnc4Haa	???|`|e2WyPzi8aa	<a href="http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/search.php?s=so+contagious&w=songs" rel="nofollow">http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/search.ph...</a><br>  <br>  Its the guitar tabs.  Guitar Pro is the best, but you need to install it on your computer.  I have it installed on mine, it was like 60 bucks or something. But it plays the music for you, shows you in tabs and standard notation, and all that good stuff.  Its better than standard tabs because it gives you the rythmn, fingering, and you can hear it.<br>  <br>  So Contagious Version 1 for guitar pro is more accurate of the two GP listed, im listening to it right now.  You MIGHT be able to get a trial download of GP..that's how i started out.  I can probably screencap or otherwise get it for you if you cannot download it..<br>  <br>  Has Lead Guitar, Rythmn Guitar and Bass Tracks for you

Call up the person many times during the day or week and disguise your voice in varied accents and ask for Joey. After a few days, call up your victim and say, ‘This is Joey. Have you taken any messages for me?’ I am sure the person at the end of the line would probably want to strangle you with the telephone wire because I had wished to do the same! <br>  <br>  2. You call up your victim and pretend to be an engineer from the phone service. Say that the phone lines have been giving some problem and you would like to test the voice quality. Select a few stupid phrases and make your victim repeat the same for voice testing! <br>  <br>  3. Call up your victim and pretend to be an RK from the local radio station.

OwE47Df8aa	A song writer is a lyricist. Lyricists write music for themselves and are paid for writing or giving their songs to other people.

FvMtam2Aaa	Sorry, I don't believe the belief in God and objective moral principles about mature dignity of the human person lead to the historical nightmare of Hotel Rwanda.  The genocide of Rwandans was the subject and the hero just saved about a 100 of them from being massacred.  People's belief in God helped them stay strong and focus on what needed to be done to survive and gave them hope.  I am confused as to how the subject matter got all turned around to the negative?  Who is teaching this?|`|gb3pcpMBaa	wow i so seen that movie in school<br>  but i wont be no help for you today. sorry

It's something about the big three bail out.  I think its called "Shutting Detriot Down" or something like that.  It's not really good and I don't get his message.  He's down talking the bail out, yet talks about all the auto worker's having to make concessions, etc.  It really is a contradiction within itself.

hJP9y6kjaa	Play a series of chords that sound nice together, that complement the sound you're looking for to go with these lyrics of yours.<br>  <br>  When you've got that, you can take the notes from each chord as a basis for the notes to draw on. You can mix in the notes of the appropriate pentatonic scale, too.<br>  <br>  For instance, let's say you like the progression C - G - Am - F (a very common progression... in the key of F it's the progression for "Glycerine" by Bush, for instance).<br>  <br>  C = C E G, G = G B D, Am = A C E, F = F A C<br>  <br>  since the key is C major, you can use C maj pentatonic = C D E G A<br>  <br>  So a melody like this might work -  C C D E G B C C C B A E F G F E .... four notes to each chord, if that helps. I just made it up, the first part especially sounds pretty cool. And this is strictly with notes from the respective chords and filling in with notes from the matching pentatonic scale. Adding notes from the matching full major/minor scale would be the next step, to give you a few more options as well... mostly as "in between" notes to get you from point A to point B (ie between chord tones).<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  <br>  Saul

AL1Luigiaa	Well everyone dies, except Jason. The 2 people think he's dead, and dump him in the lake. He comes back up and kills them both, that's the ending!|`|738e2bd340747ab38ce7182b67f01999aa	After Clay (Jared Padalecki) and his sister Whitney (Amanda Righetti) dump Jason's body into the lake, Jason pops up and takes Whitney under with him. It reminded me of the original when Alice is taken under by little Jason when she thought it was all over. Whitney stabbed Jason with his machete while the three of them were in the barnhouse. She said "Say hello to mommy!" and stabbed him. His head, mainly the back of it, ended up going inside the wood chipper; Clay and Whitney already had him hooked up to the wood chipper since they tied a chain to him that would make him either hang himself or crush his head in the machine. Sorry if this is a bit hard to understand. Here is a more accurate and detailed ending: <br>  <a href="http://www.themoviespoiler.com/Spoilers/fridaythe13th.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.themoviespoiler.com/Spoilers/...</a><br>  ^^I love that website :) haha.|`|WyK8ZcI0aa	at the end clay basically the main character and his sister whitney put jason in a wood chipper right before he starts to grind they stop it . they show them a day later in a dock where they dump jason's body and his hockey mask.about 15 seconds later jason comes out of the water from under the dock and reaches for whitney. then credits|`|mG8gDExGaa	They dumped his body back in the lake, and you can pretty much tell what happens next.

TBD6SPaTaa	Hey,rihannafan.  How's it goin' tonight?  I found the most annoying about the popular kids in my school was that the rest of the kids looked up to them.  And what was funny was that I felt like I was still popular even if I didn't hang around with the popular crowd.  I was a social misfit and I hung around with the other crowd.  We weren't popular,But we weren't losers either.  We had fun times in High School.  Now that I look back,These kids had respect for me.  The popular kids as well as the unpopular kids.  Maybe in a way,I could've been popular.  But then,I wouldn't be myself.  Why you ask,Babe?  Are you getting annoyed with some popular kids in school?  Don't let these kids get to you.  Watch,After they get outta High School,Things will look different.  And you just might be the one that wins the popular vote.  Just by being you.  I went to one of my HS reunions.  Some of those kids have changed in a big way.  And not for the better.  It isn't because it was destined for them.  It was just coincidental.  Even though they weren't real friends with me in HS.  They came to love me and respect me now.  That was because they remember how I treated them.  With honor and respect.  As long as you can have respect for someone,They will have respect for you.  rihannafan,I've gotta swing outta here.  You have a goodnight tonight.  I hope this answer pleases you somewhat.  Take it easy and God bless.  Bye for now.|`|KHL4N6mtaa	that they think that popularity in school is actually gonna get them somewhere in life in the real world.|`|YvOm6u65aa	There is no popular people in my school. We all talk to one another.<br>  <br>  There's like 28 people in my one class....it's cos I live in a village.

You can't say something that you don't know. Like you said, just because you wear skinny jeans and bangs doesn't make you emo... Kind of like me. I hate it when people call me emo cause I'm not and they say it without knowing me. That's what gets me pissed. I always go off on people like that.|`|AA12302661	Yeah i'm sick and tired of that..<br>  <br>  Just because you wear something that some people out of a certain group wear does not mean you're part of it.<br>  <br>  Ignore them.|`|rh2toYSZaa	Labels are so stupid. I ahte the fact that they label as a 'emo' by the music & clothes i wear. I hate that they put labels on everyone. Can everyone just be themselves!<br>  Good Question! :D|`|ojEkgJoqaa	not on my clothes thank you<br>  <br>  angel hai are you a girl?|`|6OldQQCOaa	Yea. Pisses me off.<br>  I went off on my friends because they called a group of people "those emo kids." <br>  I never stereotype.<br>  <br>  Oh. And "emo" is a music genre.|`|s0p70EHVaa	i hate it<br>  i am myself and that's all i need to be.|`|Tj2xROpwaa	heack yes. i am myself and thats all i will be thank you|`|vkeuaEHiaa	I always avoided the labels, because I dress like a prep, a skater, a nerd, a jock, everything. If I like it I buy it. If I see something cute at Hot Topic I'll buy it, and same for Hollister. I don't care how people view me|`|HqwO5LZaaa	Hate labels.<br>  "Ohh you're wearing skinny jeans, do you hate life or something?"<br>  Agh. Punch them in the face.<br>  <br>  They get old after a while,<br>  So just ignore the label-givers, doesn't matter what the hell they think.|`|qcuXR1Msaa	All of these "labels" are bloody music genres, not genres of people. Everyone just needs to quit acting like we all need these descriptions alread.|`|ZfAiUNvHaa	its just a way of life. Its never going to stop. Most people hate it, but its something people like to do. <br>  And some of those people DO call themselves emo. lol|`|INoFAZvAaa	Yeah, labels are pretty stupid, even if they're true fairly often. Although nowadays most people don't fit the label they're assigned.|`|qwInrvUGaa	labels suck<br>  <br>  unless they are on food|`|DMMPfox8aa	People|`|KyGhcrzLaa	i know, me too|`|ac79c1bc2006138a997b16c6ea9ba908aa	yes!|`|G7OwyyHPaa	yeah.|`|UEzTKxwYaa	labels never go away, so get used to them.|`|xTb8u783aa	we should not get  labeled|`|f0JL2cHEaa	I dislike labels as well, though truly I don't think that there is one to fully encompass... uh, me. XD|`|BjmJharpaa	yes I am<br>  People call me emo<br>  its so freakin annoying!<br>  we're all human|`|mzhFrm5Taa	Yes I totally completely agree with you. I hate labels and those stereotypes, the emo one is the one that annoys me the most. Like, being emo comes from what you feel inside and the way you see things and feel about them. If you have side bangs and it means your an emo, like, 3 quarters of the world's population must be emo then because almost everybody has had side bangs at some point in their life or has them now. Ughr, it's so stupid. There are soo much of those kind of people that believe those stereotypes and go along with them, I don't get how the hell they can think wearing skinny jeans&having side bangs means your emo. It proves those people are actually a tad stupid because evidentally they don't have a clue what the word even means.<br>  <br>  You will find alot more non-emo people that dress ''emo'' than actual emo people dressing ''emo'' because it is generally posers & wannabes that wear the clothes. Alot of people that actually are the true meaning of the word emo, and have the feelings, chances are, they will go un-noticed to people because nobody knows how they feel because they can't look at somebody and see their feelings. Most people that dress ''emo'' are posers&wannabes. Fact. && ''emo'' is not even a dress sense or style, or type of music for that matter. Like I said, it is all about the way you feel inside, the way you see things and the way you think&feel about things.|`|jhGZNVYpaa	You know what I'm sick of? People who complain about being labled. <br>  GET OVER IT. <br>  Seriously. If someone thinks your emo, but you're not, then it doesn't MATTER what the hell they think. <br>  You know that you label people too. You might not tell them, but you think about it in your head. Even if you don't, you subconsiously do. <br>  I label myself as a complete and total *****, and I know that other people feel the same way.|`|2lTMxh8eaa	IAgreeWithYou100%.<br>  PeoplethinkI'mAHippieAndIEscapedFromTh...<br>  TheyNeedToStop!|`|lFzFtiCBaa	I must be a dumb azz cuz that explains an emo look to me.|`|CHo2t4P7aa	Labels suck.|`|gxWTZ3Tqaa	Yes it is. I HATE being called **** based on what I look like or where I buy my clothes. I don't get why anyone would label people or themself. It is pointless.|`|kpTJdZLzaa	yep :)|`|45aqUZ8gaa	I just ignore it all, but you're right. It's stupid.|`|SUZkg4Wuaa	Yeah. Its really stupid.<br>  I go off as well.|`|sdTFye4Taa	Sick sick sick of them.<br>  If your going to label someone atleast know what it is. <br>  I mean, ihve to admit i sometimes label but saying you dont label is like saying you dont piss.<br>  I only really label when its to describe someone to my frineds<br>  like "look at that blonde girl"<br>  you know? just as a description like "look that girl whose kind of preppy" <br>  <br>  I also think that peoples aprearances has become the new racism<br>  just because someone has choppy hair and wears alot of eyemakeup and listens to hardcore music  or is blonde and wears hollister and listens to the top 40s<br>  doesnt make them less of a person. or more of a person.<br>  I know equally amazing and equally awful of all "labels"<br>  so they are stupid,<br>  they dont mean anything.

nkCBUg6Yaa	Say you're just trying to be nice to her and trying to not stoop to her level. Tell him that you're trying to act like she's not getting to you, so maybe she'll grow up and see how immature talking about people is. I've had that problem like 3 times and just ignore it, they get mad that you're not reacting to them and go find someone else to pick on.|`|FpaWSruQaa	Try this<br>  <br>  <a href="http://demotivationalminds.wordpress.com/2009/02/22/demotivational-posters-volume-33/" rel="nofollow">http://demotivationalminds.wordpress.com...</a>|`|A2Ne8sdFaa	well then,<br>  he shouldnt be so mad|`|mD4Xn3jNaa	hmm<br>  try tying your shoes a different way<br>  it works|`|BKr3y30maa	Personally, I would just drop the subject....don't bring it up again.  The ***** isn't worth getting into another argument with your boyfriend.  I would make sure she keeps her paws off your man though.  Good luck and hope things get better.|`|8PQ1utAKaa	I am glad I don't have your problems.|`|0ectWZxAaa	Just let it go. He is probably having a bad day.

Ask him for advice about something that you really don't need help on..but this will just have him feel bad and apologize...<br>  Hope I helped!<br>  ~Nicole|`|YVSIje93aa	Wow. Did you explain to him that you just thought she was going to say happy birthday? Why is he talking to her anyway? Shouldn't he follow his own advise? You shouldn't have to loose all contact with anyone, and if you want to that's fine, but just because he gave you advise doesn't mean you need to follow it. You are definitely NOT in the wrong here. I can understand him caring about you not fighting with someone, but that's your fight not his, and he should know you don't have to follow his advise.

So to her, Rosalie is the most beautiful girl in the world.|`|tLI94qWNaa	Ok, first of all there is not such thing as "The most beautiful girl in the world."  That is just shallow thinking right there.  I thought she was perfect and very very beautiful.   <br>  <br>  Wasn't edward suppose to be the most handsome man ever seen???  He was handsome but again, there is not such thing as the most handsome man in the world either.|`|D3ep2x7caa	no she wasn't the most beautiful girl in the world.<br>  but is it really possible to find one girl so gorgeous? everyone would have to agree that she was beautiful enough, which is clearly not possible, especially when people contribute different opinions all over the place. on top of that, she would have to know how to act as well. i think the film makers did a good job of trying to find someone that was not only pretty (enough), but could take on the part of rosalie well, also.|`|h3t2qqDXaa	Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

tGAt3ZKkaa	This is NOWHERE near my most embarrassing moment, its more like the most embarrassing moment for my friends boyfriend AND me.<br>  <br>  We were at the beach, pretty far out, her boyfriend was surfing and we were just floating around on a massive board her dad had made.<br>  And a massive wave came at us all and knocked her BF of his surfboard and us off the board. And while I was under the water my bikini bottoms came off and my friend BF did a face plant on my bare butt!!!<br>  <br>  OMG!! I tried to talk to him saying "uh, what a coincidence!, me, you . . . my butt!" and I paused "did I just say that?"<br>  <br>  every thing between the 3 of us was just quiet for at least 1 hour.<br>  <br>  lol<br>  <br>  AND<br>  <br>  We had 70's night at my school, and I wa sin year 7 and so I didn;t know whatw as going on and what we were going to have to do and so, I grabbed my arm and said "what the hell is going on I feel like an idiot" she was holding a microphone and so everyone heard it.<br>  I felt like an idiot.<br>  <br>  AND<br>  <br>  I was with my friend and her BF (yes the same BF that face planted into my butt) and we were at the movies, my crush came in and we went to sit up the top.<br>  As my crush sat down, my friends BF said to me "hey Jen stop" I turned out I was in such a dreamland of love (lol) was leaning over the next rail of seats.<br>  I sat up and (oh, i forgot to say that infront of us was a long wide rail down to the front of the room) and so when we got up, (the movie wasn't over, we just hated it) I tipped over my friends foot and landed on the wide rail and when my friend and her BF tried ot help me they accidently let go and I went sliding down the rail!<br>  I was screaming, really loud, saying things like "OMG help me!! aug!!"<br>  I hit the bottom and fell off the side and I got up to see everyone laughing their butts off.<br>  <br>  OMG and there are SO many more embarrassing moments of mine but it would take a book to list them all.|`|2lTMxh8eaa	IHadAPieceOfGumStuckToMyHairAllDay.<br>  IDidn'tEvenKnow.<br>  TheyAllLaughedAtMe!|`|P4WJD6Cpaa	Too embarassing to mention here.

AA10053661	The traumatic and disasterous moments. It's not like I dwell on the negative. But the way I react during the negative moments helps me understand what kind of person I can be. And truthfully, it makes me so much more appreciative during the good times that you just feel transformed by the negative in such a positive way. <br>  <br>  I suppose I measure my life by the negative moments because each time I encountered an obstacle..... I encountered a change in myself. So as I look back I think...... "Oh yes, that was before I was able to figure this out..... " Or before I went through this phase... or before I had to experience this hardship. Now...... I can look back and see that I'm molded by the experiences, both good or bad. But it was the hardships that helped me be who I am now. <br>  <br>  (And I hope that's not too sucky of a person. lol)|`|k0Ewe7mCaa	How many times a day I laugh and enjoy myself.|`|lMKy9Ho8aa	when i can resolve conflicts peaceful and orderly.

QtIpuKM3aa	if you can still get them I would get them cause they are very popular that would be like Johnny Depp haveing an autograph session and tickets wnet on sale for $20 early and the ywhere $15 at the door what would you do?|`|7IATGj4Kaa	i think you should buy early seeing as all of their obsessed fans are going to watch and it will be packed. Or you can go to buy the tickets really early in the morning for a late showing.|`|HqAzo0j9aa	tons of people will want to see it so even they early tickets may be sold out early|`|gwI5SQ6Iaa	unfortunately, many people will waste their time and go see this lol so yes you should get tickets early just in case|`|v6KqicByaa	They'll be sold out quickly, so get them early.

JqnKmlYqaa	i liked the movies 1,2 3 and 4 a lot.<br>  <br>  the 5th one wasnt as good.<br>  <br>  it didnt have like a climax of the movie.<br>  it was just like a long movie that seemed like a filler.<br>  like just a step in the series to get to something better.<br>  <br>  i saw the preview for the 6th movie, and it looks pretty intense. i wanna see it!|`|tLI94qWNaa	Best in my opinion would be Harry potter and the goblet of fire. <br>  I just really love the whole story and the characters are just perfect.  It wasn't a lame everyone loves harry movie either, alot of the movie people didn't like him and I thought that was awesome.  <br>  <br>  Worst-The prisoner of azkiban.  <br>  It was so long and so boring and made very little sense.  I dont really see how it had anything to do with the evil at all.|`|5yUjCGFSaa	The first one, Philosopher's stone, or Sorcerer's stone in America, is my favorite, because everything is so fresh and innocent.<br>  <br>  I hate Half-Blood Prince because I was a huge fan of Dumbledore.|`|o7DtskAQaa	the first movie is harry potter and the sorcerers stone.  how could you get that wrong if it is your favorite harry movie?<br>  <br>  i love all of them.  i can't think of one i like less|`|nQwSlue1aa	My favorite changes constantly.

I wasn't nearly impressed and it wasn't all that wonderful. I loved the performances, although some characters (e.g., Bradley Cooper and Scarlett Johansson) were impossible to be liked. Funny and refreshing, great for a romantic comedy with stories that every and each one of us faces every single day in their lives. However, in real life, not everyone is so ridiculously beautiful as each cast member is, and in real life not everyone is blessed with a happy ending. I've watched movies like this a million times before and this one has nothing new to add to the pile.|`|tLI94qWNaa	Vantage point, it was ok not as great as everyone made it seem.  <br>  <br>  I am now watching Forbidden Kingdom, just turned it on.|`|BaNrweQ4aa	the last full film i watched on DVD was american pie - at band camp :) but i watched a bit of borat; and turned it off and went bed :)<br>  <br>  the last film i watched at the cinema was he's just not that into you; on valentines day :)|`|AA12270666	in the cinema the last movie i saw was twilight. it was okay, not that great if you compare it to the book.<br>  <br>  and in dvd last movie i saw was pineapple express; it was a little strange, funny though haha i love james franco.|`|VlaX0Rfmaa	I saw Confessions Of A Shopaholic last night.

Well over a yr ago now i think-I usually cant stand them, but it was suprisingly decent-the main star was thanking everybody on the way out, we were at the initial screening we won tickets for in glasgow. Seth rogen, i think hes alot more popular now. <br>   <br>  The last dvd i watched was will ferrel in Elf. Supposedly its his best movie according to some movie magazines ive read, i was quite suprised, although ive not seen any of his other films yet however, so i cant really compare. Films such as anchorman look quite poor if judging by trailers alone! Lol.<br>   <br>  I bought the dark knight, ali (will smith), and stranger than fiction last, so they will be my next lot to watch! Knowing how long i take in getting around to watching my films i should have finished them by next xmas :)|`|iZ2J85Hpaa	The Devil Wears Prada =) Love the film!

You see a deer buck run across in front of you followed by about 10 does. The snow on the tree limbs looks so silvery white and glitters in the sun.  You notice several chickadees in the trees, flitting about, twittering happily against the blue sky with wispy clouds.  Your breath clouds and it's good to be alive.  Then your feet get cold and you run back home to put them up in front of the blazing fireplace while your three kitties come and sit on you, purring.<br>  I choose sun tan.|`|rcNQvCeXaa	a nice warm walk on the beach with a warm sea lapping around your toes and when it gets too hot you go for a swim , Sun tan for me .|`|GV5xfxNsaa	Oh sun tan in miami it"s topless I still take off my bottoms too.I live close to south beach i can walk there.|`|1YNFFfmWaa	Sun tan for sure =)|`|5sIA8oYAaa	A walk on a warm beach<br>  suntan|`|9bd9414381f10bcdaf459fbf92925724aa	Sun Tan|`|67f34282988bfc3fb8c3c876e7296801aa	Nothing, sun tan|`|0VbAMZccaa	skiing|`|oC5XGZcVaa	a warm walk on the beach<br>  <br>  sun tan|`|8zu3a4fIaa	under the sheets with my girl !!|`|Ks6Ac9SSaa	Any situation can be fun if your with the right person or people.|`|NX4LYXkqaa	Yes i agree fully to have nice cold walk on the beach with proper dress|`|JhvqUvlsaa	A run on the beach; hot or cold.<br>  <br>  Sun tan|`|WbKBHh8Haa	warm fire and romantic music<br>  <br>  suntan|`|wzue5Xzbaa	A nice hot bath. :D<br>  <br>  Tan.|`|QEqGukjZaa	nice hot walk on beach..naked..<br>  <br>  sun tan|`|Hzf3QK9faa	Joejorob and I often go for walks in the fall and winter at his Aunt and Uncle's at Bluewater beach and it is quiet and we enjoy it because it is so private and different than the summer months there.

Have a Good Sunday Evening Everyone! :) Great question Mrs. Sawman!|`|3j7WE8jGaa	I suppose a nice cold walk along the beach could be very refreshing....but I would find the idea far more attractive if the sun were shining. I did spend some time by the sea in the south of France in December a few years ago....and I quite enjoyed that....but it was not *too* cold....and the sun was out for the few days I was there. I think rain or snow would really put me off the idea. I have always loved spending time on a certain beach in Maine in the summer, though....walking on the beach or even just sitting there admiring the fantastic view....I think there are probably very few things better than that.<br>  <br>  I am not a *huge* fan of extreme temperatures at *either* end of the scale....but right now, sun tan sounds a lot more appealing than frost bite!|`|bcf393e4db41afbc89350db8fced8a1aaa	wolfie, a nice, cold, drink while sitting in your lawnchair on your deck looking out over the beach.|`|nkmwGAKjaa	I would prefer a warm, sunny beach and a sun tan. ;-)|`|rM9WzIkHaa	im irish really white the sun is my enemy ill take frost bite please|`|ZDOfXBd2aa	A nice warm walk on the beach?<br>  <br>  Sun tan please.|`|63e6fbd5b85357a27d660c7d5c0b9ee9aa	tan or better yet some one to keep you warm as you watch th sunset|`|e00dff88dc30b4a7021797a2956952d6aa	a moon lit night walk on the beach|`|68ee405bb00c52b1f70ed3481fd154f2aa	Frost bite and I am generally somebody who hates the cold... but the beach is a different kettle of fish ...<br>  <br>  in Summer beaches are crowded and *unemotional*.. in winter.. when there's wild chilling winds and the waves are whipping up wild foam, and fewer people are about ... the beaches have character... power.. and are exhilarating <br>  <br>  cold beaches ANY DAY....|`|YUAegpPoaa	Getting up in the morning and going to the balcony and there it is.<br>  It'll be there all day.

So I ended up goin to dinner with my family.  & My mom kept taking pictures of me and forcing me to smile which was soooooo annoying.<br>  On top of all that, my dress didn't fit well and I also wasn't working out so I gained a little weight too.<br>  <br>  I hope this makes u feel better about yours|`|AlocuXIFaa	I regret to inform you that at 16 years of age your happiness and days of smiles and laughter has officially ended.

So the woman askes: - What's the bad news?. The Doctor says: - That you DO have Alzheimer. -SO What's the good news? The doctor says: That you'll forget it in a few hours! hahahaha!<br>  <br>  HAPPY BDAY|`|TufkjxfCaa	First of all your eyebrow will grow back, you still have five people who are coming to your party- which sounds like it should be loads of fun, im sure you're not grounded for the rest of your life and it cant be that bad because you''re on the computer, and so what if someone has the same dress as you that just means you both have really good taste, you still have loads of time before June if you really think it's necessary to lose weight, and about the cat thing- now you know what not to do to a cat lol idk if you take away anything from this it should be look at the bright side!|`|vjvJ5Mnfaa	1. At least you still have your right one. It's better to have one than neither of them.<br>  <br>  2. Seven's a crowd. You'll have much more fun with less people, and you'll get more attention for your birthday.<br>  <br>  3. Life lesson here...never worry about someone wearing the same thing as you, only worry about wearing it better than them.<br>  <br>  4. It's better to be fat and happy than skinny and miserable.<br>  <br>  5. If the cat died, he's better off and he'll never go through that again.<br>  <br>  Happy Birthday babe. Don't let one day get you down.|`|YW1DXceqaa	none of those things should get you to down. i mean look around you. Is there food in the fridge? a roof over your head? look at the little things that make up why happiness should follow you everywhere<br>  ...<br>  <br>  it's like fireworks vs a candle ...the brightness of fireworks is amazing and lights up everything but does not last...<br>  a candle is dim but lasts much longer<br>  <br>  happy b-day and remember how much this will matter 2 years from now or even less|`|AdEJBAkMaa	Smile!!!! =D|`|56bNLJykaa	Believe it or not I have been grounded before for arguing with my parents (I'm a junior)- and maybe at least you were cheered up by seeing Sophia Loren looking fine as usual (even at 70) last night at the Oscars.. I know, the nominated movies or winners were not that great. Happy belated birthday.|`|YYSfBZfoaa	Ok well one i dont really think it will give me 10 points but anyway you really should just get out of your house and hang with friends or go do something you want to i mean its not the end of the world and im sure if you just do something relaxing it will ease you up a bit ...Promise|`|MU453gLqaa	1) shave half of your right eyebrow off so they match.<br>  2) One day you will be a parent and your child will blame you when their friends can't come to their parties and you will ground them it's called payback.<br>  3) you should have everyone wear the same dress like a bridal party.<br>  4)Please I am sure you are neither stupid or fat I mean you can use a computer and read and write.<br>  5) stop watching cruel videos on y-tube if it's not fit for watching it should not be on there. Someone  should make a video where they beats  little dick an his brother on their bottom till they can't sit down.|`|tQA4eBDlaa	Get bangs to hide the eyebrow mishap.<br>  They're mean and don't deserve to come to your sick nasty party!<br>  ...It's a dress.<br>  Tutors...<br>  Oh my god, when I saw that video I literally burst into tears. Stupid little kids, it makes me want the death penalty. <br>  Happy birthday! and I hope your day gets better. You're 16, you'll be driving soon and being more independent. Don't let the little things bring you down. Have a great day! :-)

(look at the links)<br>  <br>  PC=Variety of specs, options, quality, prices, vendors, support<br>  Mac=One vendor, limited options, still more expensive.  Look below for more information..<br>  <br>  Contrary to belief, Macs are not better quality. Apple also has been changing suppliers to try to "lower the price" and thus lowering quality. Even with the lower prices, Macs still cost more, they spend a higher percent of budget trying to make it look pretty, and marketing.<br>  <br>   Today, Macs use the same hardware as PCs. Why spend extra to get the same CPU chips, graphics cards  and OS X isn't as secure as you think.. Look below.<br>  <br>  WINDOWS ADVANTAGES:<br>  <br>  Aprox 90% of the market is Windows. Most PCs include windows already pre-installed.<br>  1) A number of websites still require Internet Explorer to view and IE for Mac Stinks (it is really ies4osx which is the Windows IE version running really buggy on OS X and illegal if you don't have a legitimate copy of Windows, too many problems with it).<br>  2) More supported peripherals (printers and other things you hook into the computer) on Windows.<br>  3) Many more games<br>  4) Like the Dock on OS X (Mac)? google/yahoo rocketdock, objectdoc.<br>  <br>  Install at least Free Versions of Avira AntiVir, Avast, Comodo Firewall on the Vista.<br>  <br>  LINUX ADVANTAGES:<br>  <br>  1) Install Linux, and then get tons of software for free.Update software easily and automatically. (Checking a checkbox in either two ways to install (Add/Remove or Synaptic Package Manager), search for something you want, check a box and click apply)<br>  2) Like the Mac OS X effects? go yahoo/google COMPIZ FUSION. It can do just about any cool effect a Mac can do and more...<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Fbk52Mk1w" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Fbk52Mk...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3gkX9HDfEE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3gkX9HDf...</a>  (there is no flickering when you use it like on the video, not sure why the person has the flicker)<br>  3) Like the Mac OS X Doc? google/yahoo Cairo Dock, avant window navigator.<br>  <a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3rf5q_cairo-dock-mac-os-x-leopard-dock-on_tech" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3rf5q_...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0hzi22g2DE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0hzi22g2...</a><br>  4) It is faster/MORE SECURE. Surf the internet and even run some windows programs with Wnehq/Crossover..<br>  <br>  LINUX OS<br>  If you are worried about viruses, spyware, security, Try Linux (it is free), I have included some information about Linux and links  so you are not lost if you decide to try it.<br>  <br>  Easily turn your system into a Dual booting computer with Linux, fast, safe and secure, easy to use (contrary to belief). You then get the best of both worlds (Windows with all of its supported products, freely go online without the worry)<br>  <br>  Installing Linux in general is very simple and much more secure than OS X(Macintosh) and free.<br>  Also, most Linux distributions have a LiveCD which means you can try without installing...<br>  UBUNTU, KUBUNTU, FREESPIRE, PCLINUXOS, etc.. all have live CDS.<br>  All you have to do is..<br>  A) to download .iso file off the internet from the Linux website<br>  B) burn the .iso file to a CD or DVD (Make sure your burning software can burn an ISO or get InfraRecorder <a href="http://infrarecorder.org/" rel="nofollow">http://infrarecorder.org/</a> )<br>  C) restart the computer with the CD in the drive<br>  D) As computer is restarting, press on F12 Key a bunch of times to get a boot menu<br>  E) Select the option to boot from CD or DVD.<br>  <br>  Click on this link and follow instructions up to the point of "Once the system has started up...", (the rest is how to backup windows) for an easy picture guide for steps A-E above <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/use-ubuntu-live-cd-to-backup-files-from-your-dead-windows-computer/" rel="nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-v...</a><br>  For easy instructions on setting up Dual Boot <a href="http://apcmag.com/how_to_dual_boot_windows_xp_and_linux_xp_installed_first.htm" rel="nofollow">http://apcmag.com/how_to_dual_boot_windo...</a><br>  <br>  ANOTHER QUICK NOTE: People have been able to run OS X on a PC since the PC and Mac use the same hardware. This is not legal and I would not recommend it for security and legal reasons, the purpose is to show that there is nothing special about the MAC.<br>  <br>  A)Price...<br>  A similar equipped PC is much cheaper to purchase than Mac. Lets use Dell (but you can compare with another PC Brand if you like)<br>  <br>  **(LAPTOP)<br>  Dell Inspiron Laptop $849 dropped to $799<br>  15" Screen<br>  CPU: (upgrade to) 2.1GHz Intel Core 2 Duo<br>  Graphics: Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X3100<br>  Memory: 3GB 667MHz DDR2 SDRAM<br>  Hard Drive: 320GB Serial ATA Drive @ 5400 rpm<br>  Optical Drive: Blu-ray Disc Combo (DVD+/-RW + BD-ROM) - WRITES DVDS,CDS, READS Blue-Ray Disks<br>  <br>  Macbook $1349 just dropped to $1224<br>  13" Screen (SMALLER)<br>  CPU: 2.1GHz Intel Core 2 Duo (SAME)<br>  Graphics: Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X3100 (SAME)<br>  Memory: (upgrade to) 2GB 667MHz DDR2 SDRAM (LESS RAM)<br>  Hard Drive (upgrade to) 250GBSerial ATA Drive @ 5400 rpm (SMALLER HARD DRIVE)<br>  Optical Drive: (DVD-ROM/CD-RW) - (Writes CDs, DVDs, cannot read Blue-Ray) (WORSE AND 1/2 SPEED)<br>  <br>  **(DESKTOP)<br>  <br>  PLEASE NOTE: I'm comparing Apple Mac's vs Dells best deal. If you decide that you must have an all-in one. The Dell all-in-one has more ram, wireless keyboard and mouse and equivalent to $400 for free making the Imac still more expensive when you upgrade the Imac to try to match. Personally I don't think the All-in-Ones are a good choice, and consider them overpriced, lack expandability and repairs both more expensive and require the entire computer.<br>  <br>  PS: Apple knows that they must make Macintosh look different than PC so all Macs except the Mac Pro will not have a tower option. Apple's low end lacks expandability but it makes the Mac "look different", if Mac had a tower for low-end, more people would realize the similarities between the two.<br>  <br>  Dell: (Right Now) Specs Below costs $809<br>  CPU: 2.4 GHZ Dell Inspiron QUAD (4 Processor) CORE<br>  SCREEN: 20inch Screen<br>  MEMORY: 3GB Ram<br>  HARD DRIVE: 500 GB hard Drive<br>  OPTICAL DRIVE: 16x DVD/CD Read/Writer<br>  GRAPHICS: (upgrade to ) ATI Radeon HD 2400 PRO 128MB<br>  <br>  The Best Deal Mac is not the Mac Mini since it has no monitor, keyboard, mouse, very skimpy on options and setup... IMac is better price than the Mac Mini.<br>  <br>  IMac ($1400)<br>  CPU: 2.4 GHZ DUAL (2 Processor) CORE (SLOWER CPU)<br>  SCREEN: 20inch Screen<br>  MEMORY: (upgrade to) 2GB Ram (LESS RAM)<br>  HARD DRIVE: (upgrade to ) 500 GB hard Drive<br>  OPTICAL DRIVE: 8x DVD Reader/Writer (1/2 speed)<br>  GRAPHICS: ATI Radeon HD 2400 PRO 128MB<br>  <br>  **END OF DESKTOP<br>  <br>  B) SECURITY:<br>  <br>  Mac OS X was hacked in 2006 under 30 minutes, and hacked within 2 minutes in a contest in 2008. Linux and Vista were not able to be hacked until another day when restrictions were lowered.<br>  All macs are standardized with Cameras, if your system gets hacked, the hacker would more likely be able to turn on your camera.<br>  Please Note: All OS's have vulnerabilities.<br>  <br>  C) VIRUSES<br>  <br>  The argument that OS X has less viruses is true,  but that is against XP, BUT Mac OS X has viruses (which is significantly on the rise), a friend of mine has a virused Mac. As more users use Macs, more viruses will come out for it. Especially when users think "they are safe".<br>  Viruses on Mac are rising significantly.<br>  <br>  Google/Yahoo Mac Viruses<br>  <br>  <br>  D) WINDOWS LICENSE is discounted with PCs<br>  <br>  You do not pay the full price, for instance Dell -> you pay $50 or less for Vista Home Premium If you buy a Mac and want Vista, you pay full price.<br>  <br>  <br>  E) EXPANDABILITY & REPAIR...<br>  <br>  Repairs are more expensive than PCs since the IMac, Mac Mini are compact units, and Apple charges a premium for their services. Some repairs can be done by another repair service but the compact design of the computer causes problems.<br>  With an IMac, if the problem is with the monitor, the whole computer would have to be brought in.<br>  IMac and Mac mini lack expansion.<br>  <br>  <br>  F) PROBLEMS<br>  <br>  Sample of problems: Overheating Macbooks, OS X- not responding to keyboard, some units with 16bit screens, etc. Apple statistics are misleading since Mac users with problem machines are more likely to go out and buy a new computer than PC users.  Apple is lowering prices which means you can expect lower quality than in the past. Apple had switched the manufacturers producing parts.

But the one and ONLY thing I hate about him is the fact that he's too good for me and I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that I can't have him...

Here's what I read...<br>  <br>  "The present world is separated into two paths. The lower path is followed by the One-Hearted people, and leads into a Paradise on Earth. The upper path is that of the Two-Hearted people and leads to self-destruction (in either 2009-10 or 2012-13). It is the path of technology without spirituality. Three world-shaking events are depicted by two circles and an half-circle. The last circle is an event known as the "mystery egg" or Day of Purification (Planet X?), the severity of which will depend on how many spiritual people are working toward peace when it occurs.<br>  <br>  The one-hearted people will try to lead the two-hearted people (shown as a headless people) back to the eternal path (lower path). If the two-hearted people persist in living in ignorance, it will lead to chaos and self-destruction (jagged path).<br>  <br>  The two symbols beneath the lower path represent the two helpers of Elder Brother. The solar symbol and swastika represent his masculine helper, and a red cross with lines in between (representing female life blood) represents his feminine helper.<br>  <br>  Elder Brother and his helpers will arrive to help the Hopi and others who stay close to traditional ways. If they come from the west, the battle will be terrible -- the sky will turn red and the earth will shake for days. This time is known as the Day of Purification ... when Purification Day nears, we will see a halo of mist around the heavenly bodies and the sun ..."|`|HWDkt6DUaa	no one on this earth knows only God does<br>  <br>  people said it was supposed to end in 1981 but it didnt<br>  <br>  they said it was gonna end in 2000 but it didnt<br>  <br>  dont always believe what you hear<br>  <br>  the world will end when God wants it to|`|kzoUGdg0aa	No it won't end then. People always make crazy predictions like this... This world was meant to end many times before but it still is going on. Just think, the world has been around for millions of years so what is the chance it will end in our lifetime?... Very small chance indeed.|`|6Tx8Opmraa	No. No one predicted the end of the world.

Don't think about it. We might be hit by an asteroid or comet, or it will pass and just become closer to the sun. If it hits us do we all die? do we all live? I don't know and only time can tell. I don't believe in fate, so I believe nothing is planned out. But there is a chance something catastrophic might happen that day, it might not. I don't know, just live your life, and you'll find out in 3 years.|`|ZX5aVIA4aa	ok no. it has somehting to do with the myan calandar. they only made it up until 2012.. but dont forget the people who made this calandar that you think will cause the world to end used to live in mud huts and push eachother off tall buildings for sacrifices. <br>  <br>  anyway some philospher from a long time ago predicted 9/11 and then also predicted the world to end 2 years ago. hahaha and dont believe everything youre told. k?|`|pXkWoqKjaa	i really don't think it is gonna end but maybe i am just saying that because  don't want to die...<br>  but in my opinion, no one can predict when the earth is gonna end except for God himself...<br>  so everyone is full of themselves..<br>  don't let it bother you...<br>  i think the mayans just had too much timeon their hands...|`|MtzDCkgFaa	I think the people got tired of making the stupid calender and gave up on it and now it's freaking people out. But no, I don't think the world is going to end in 2012.|`|Y3PFT8f2aa	The bible says that it will... :) but I still don't think people should base everything off of life by what they see in the bible.

cSBZQfaIaa	well it`s not good.. but i understand you it`s not just you that are happier when drunk, i`m happier too when i`m drunk.. We better watch out our livery lol|`|jMOhEUjaaa	yeah<br>  only alcohol can improve<br>  you as a person..<br>  not accomplishments.|`|WKcJE9bKaa	No|`|wW6NJk4jaa	me too.......|`|qsWk3Fo6aa	If you are not happy with yourself sober, then alcohol is only masking your unhappiness.  Long term use of alcohol can lead to depression.  So yeah, you may just become more unhappy if you rely on alcohol to make you happy.  I like to get hammered to, but it has gotten me into trouble with the law.  So be careful with it.|`|oC5XGZcVaa	idk i'm the same way, i don't think it's bad b/c that when you can completely forget all of your problems, so of course your gonna be your happiest!|`|bmWUqNJaaa	im happiest when im high|`|HmqHf3qDaa	yes that is the road to ruin<br>  get your sober life in order.|`|BwYSrzXRaa	That's what happens to me aswell.

01qR87Fhaa	You wouldn't be at fault. But keep in mind that women take small things and make them huge..For example, If a guy were to give a girl his jacket in the cold..the girl may think he likes her while the guy is being a gentleman.<br>  So, also keep in mind..that you would lead them on.|`|EsufC1qhaa	no. it just means you're being casual and simple. nothing wrong as far as i see it.  and i don't think it will go further. i doubt it.|`|hvZSKn6Eaa	Nope, but if you slip in a finger that IS considered flirting...a bit...licking the finger after is a total lead on...|`|SlR0Cp5saa	No because my best friend does that to me and he knows that we'll never be more then just friends. It's still cute though.|`|GLd6cmlcaa	It depends on what country they're from. In Europe most countries do that casually. Here in the U.S. some people may think your leading them on.|`|qnmI1bmkaa	no|`|R7x0qIqyaa	That's common in France.|`|YW1DXceqaa	I never had that chance but i see EVERYONE do it so it so i think it's considered as a hello..strangely enough|`|fBXRNKyuaa	Who cares what they think, just make sure they know you meant it as a friendly gesture. If one of my guy friends came up to me and kissed me on the cheek I would know that we were close enough where things like that didn't matter.|`|0ectWZxAaa	I don't kiss friends on the cheek. I just hug. I have had a guy friend kiss me on the cheek before. I  thought it was sorta strange.|`|uaq8OSUjaa	No, it would be considered "hello, let's have sex"|`|NJfpY7nIaa	No. Me and my friends do that all the time.
dicjbwtCaa	its not time for you to place your<br>  location into her destination ...|`|K1LGV0Kkaa	Sometimes they are not in love <br>  Not emotionally ready<br>  Want to wait until marraige<br>  Want to have more time or get to know the person more<br>  or sometimes they are just making an excuse to not have sex with you.|`|cee27a373f64a299e31c2d3af3a93660aa	That they aren't ready for sex... Usually they are scared or don't want to do it. This isn't one of those things where it's a hidden meaning.|`|A15bfvkBaa	They are too young.<br>  Or it's illegal. <br>  Or they are waiting for the 'Right' person<br>  x)|`|WhSkavCzaa	If you're talking about a teenager, then they're just not ready and you shouldn't need an explanation.<br>  <br>  If you're talking about an adult, they're waiting to feel comfortable with you or waiting for feelings to get stronger.|`|eta0c25yaa	They are not comfortable having sex yet, or they rather wait for that special someone till they get married.|`|X8riDZBqaa	I think it's fear. I'm all grown up now, and didn't have that issue, but I knew lots of girls who 'weren't ready when they were just afraid.|`|2WiKH3Hkaa	It means they're waiting for someone better than me to come along.|`|jtYL9Qqnaa	Well, some people wait until they are old enough, comfortable with their body, married, etc.|`|8SKpsVG7aa	Take me

I loose everything.|`|KHL4N6mtaa	i've never done that before. too hard, i always lose them before i finish using them up.|`|ybwqYZ1waa	I've done it.  But when it gets little and crappy  I throw it away.|`|3NQizLOKaa	wow good question. not me .|`|ofQ1QM1Saa	Yes, just once.<br>  <br>  I kept using it, and lost track of it sometime, and found it again. It was around an inch long when I finally gave it up.|`|INoFAZvAaa	oddly enough, i've only ever used one pen until it was empty. for pencils i usually end up breaking them or running out of eraser and lending them away to not get back|`|E5rhAaLGaa	Never|`|SRlzo5yXaa	never . haha|`|eOb841qbaa	never ever.

I have not finished off a pen though, but I assume if I bought quality ones with replacement ink cartridges, instead of cheapo ones, I would pay more attention to them.|`|rqJSk1omaa	I usually kill the eraser and start using a new pencil. I have never used a whole pencil up. I don't loose them, I just have a large collection of pencils with no erasers.|`|W46PN3eUaa	If by "used up" you mean used until it's little more than an eraser and a tiny bit of wood and is too small to hold, then once, during grade 4 or 5 I think. Since then? Never.|`|k0SSCpG9aa	a couple times ive gotten it down to about an inch and still been using it <br>  <br>  answer mine<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlYtLcYi.lHFuAkbywgZ7Jfsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220144035AA0DB3o">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|P9avMTBqaa	omg never, i have never used a whole pencil before.

Now I love Gone with the Wind!|`|RRTDRSw1aa	both are excellent, real classics. both reflect some real history and insight, if taken with a grain of salt.<br>  <br>  as zany as oz appears on the surface, it has some deep psychology when you dig a little deeper. everybody has some weakness and failing and long to be better. some want to be smarter, braver etc. and they often try to find it in some direct way, like going to the wizard. these unrequieted longings often rage in childhood and the author knew exactly what he was doing. you can take it as a lively fantasy chock full of novel characters but there is more.|`|3ee64ee7ec766828c5143beacd3dc7f6aa	While GWTW is a darned good movie, I'll watch The Wizard of Oz at the drop of a pointed hat.<br>  <br>  "Bring me that girl and her dog--do what you like with the others, but I want her alive and unharmed--Now, fly!--Fly!--Fly!--Fly!..."|`|VjPnHxZyaa	Gone with the Wind!  <br>  <br>  The wizard of oz always scared me as a kid...and I still don't care for it.  either do my kids...<br>  <br>  besides I never cared for Judy Garlands voice...she was a cute kid|`|Klb4ZYcVaa	Gone with the Wind!!!! 110%.

LPO8RlVdaa	A belief or a faith in something greater than ourselves is part of the human condition for many people. It is natural and innate.<br>  <br>  WHAT we believe in varies greatly. For some it is a belief, a faith, in science. That our universe is held together with fundamental biological, chemical and physical laws. For others however, it is a belief in a faith system such as God or Allah or Buddha, etc.<br>  <br>  For those that believe in this faith system, a lot of the time it is socialisation that causes this belief. Socialising agents such as parents/schools/media/the church/culture, etc all have an influence throughout peoples lives telling them this is right and this is wrong, so people grow up believing that their belief is the way the world works. <br>  <br>  Others have fundamental shocks or life events that profoundly alter there way of thinking and that can cause them to believe in a god, or vice versa. <br>  <br>  The reasons why are very individual, but it is part of human nature to believe in SOMETHING.|`|NJfpY7nIaa	I could ask why it's so hard for you to believe. <br>  It's a debate that will go on forever...<br>  Define realistic. You can't. There's no<br>  true definition...people opinions will differ and<br>  you can't prove which is right. So you make the decision for yourself.<br>  <br>  I believe in God. I don't need a reason to prove he is "real" to you. What's more important is what me and God share...which are of no use to you. It's something that is between me and him. Other believers have their own things/experiences that they share with him as well. A lot of people have this need for reasons and knowing the "truth" that it blinds them from so much more.|`|qcuXR1Msaa	I can get why people want to believe, maybe because of the crappy place this world is and it's like whatever gets you through the day.<br>  I'm atheist, but I've got a lot of respect for people who through all the crap life throws at them who still believe|`|LgNqYUECaa	Not sure. I'm a agnostic.|`|X8riDZBqaa	I believe in God. I'm very spiritual.<br>  I don't so much believe the Bible. It doesn't work for me. But neither does the big bang. I don't care how we got here. I just care where we go next. <br>  Peace folks. Believing in God and believing in a Holy book don't have to go hand in hand.|`|rugfqD4Aaa	well at one point in time saying "god did it" was the best people could come up with, eventually that because the authority and it is still being passed down to everyone's children, you believe what you're told as a child|`|ZYA0Rt7Haa	Yh i agree with you. My point is 'who made god?' Its all a bit unrealistic to me.|`|4mUlQ7Rbaa	1. It wasnt "someone". God isint a person. <br>  2. why cant God and the big bang be real? I believe that God made the big band happen and then created the earth afterwards in 7 days. He could have done it in a flash but He chose to create it in 7 days because it shows humans that it takes time for something to happen.<br>  3. This highly complicated and perfect world is not an accident.|`|m7nrQEflaa	I don't know..

FeZR63f8aa	I like the Alesana one best.  It's awesome. :D<br>  The book looks cool, but that might be too much to pay for it.  I wouldn't suggest getting it from that source.  It may seem like you can't get the book from anywhere else, I bet you could if you tried hard enough.  Either that, or save up more money before getting it, or wait a bit longer.<br>  The Drop Dead! tee is also really cute, but too much money for it unless you want it really, really bad.  Save up more money first, or ask for it for a present.<br>  The other two are just okay, I like the umbrella one better than the other one though.|`|0ectWZxAaa	Is the book at the library?

nsXiB4gsaa	I would just rather watch something funny with my gf instead of a movie thats probably going to make her cry.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  haha! nice Vance!|`|8cAQzRj6aa	They're usually very generic; following the same basic plot line. Someone moves to a new school or town and falls in love, and it takes different shapes from there but always ends in a kiss. <br>  <br>  I don't mind watching some of the funnier ones with chick-friends (John Tucker must die, etc.) but anything like the notebook makes me want to kill myself.|`|VKXNWcbGaa	Most guys hate (well more dislike) them because they have no action in them, no suspense, nothink to keep you watching or wondering.|`|UVciAbXxaa	some of us just dont like the emotional type movies an some of us are ok with it like i will watch any chick flick with my girl just cause i knoe she enjoy me being with her anything|`|AA12302661	Hello? Chick flicks.. That's why guys don't like them.. It's a girls thing.. <br>  <br>  I'm a girl..<br>  <br>  I don't even like chick flicks.. I prefer a bit of drama, action or horror.|`|k6flESfNaa	i came home one day and my bro was eating a whole chocolate cake and was watching the notebook O.o ........<br>  <br>  <br>  yea i know something was wrong there [he was dumped :( ]|`|mzhFrm5Taa	Dude...because they are for CHICKS? As in girls? DUHH? There is a reason they are called CHICK flicks.|`|6OldQQCOaa	Ah dang "kaity <3" got to it first.<br>  And seriously? Chick flicks are boring. Give me something that blows up.|`|Ir51Eb0Kaa	Machismo.|`|hHjfoKEHaa	I'm a girl and i hate chick flicks. <br>  They're cheesy and too predictable.|`|jlZZbdIjaa	guys have a lot of issues...yeah i understand...sometimes.|`|EZyHOht7aa	because they are about lame womenly conflicts i dont give a crap about sorry haaha|`|IhfdkCnjaa	because football is better|`|XbRc9Hdaaa	I enjoy them, I like most types of movies.|`|Xdo10FGqaa	i like chick flicks and im a guy|`|K1LGV0Kkaa	Yes. I don't like a lot of chick flicks neither.|`|8S8MqwnOaa	Uh, besides all Hollywood movies these days having MAJOR SCRIPT ISSUES, most chick flicks are systematically geared to appeal to women, aka CHICK FLICKS, imagine a movie, tailored solely towards men (probably something along the lines of T2 meets and really hot porno), mayhaps you wouldn't like it. Oh yeah, plus girls are stupider than guys. LOL.|`|BNEby8Iwaa	i think guys don't like watching chick flicks because they feel like if they watch it and they actually like that movie, they're gay or something<br>  <br>  i think that's lame cuz whe a girl like a guy movie that doesn't make her a lesbein hahahah<br>  <br>  guys should just get ver it and watch the dam movie<br>  <br>  i like it when guys like chick flicks haahah idk|`|xshjrnfKaa	Chick flicks are usaly sappy. Men don't like be thought as emotional. I know stupid. Chick flicks are directed to woman. They put in things that woman like, which is most likely something a guy doesn't like. Guys like fast paced action with explosions or stupid comedy. In the end it has to do with personality differences.|`|N3WtiNDRaa	there made for girls. guys dont wana see ppl falling in love all the drama bla bla it draggs on its sooo predictable...what guys dont like. <br>  they like suspension, blowing things up, action, to them chick flicks are boring. but not guys think that. usually the ones who are mucho or think there mucho dont think there cool enough for the chick flicks. oo well.|`|GLd6cmlcaa	Im a guy and i don't mind chick flicks in fact i actually teared up a little when i saw the notebook and im comfortable enough in my masculinity to admit that.|`|QUlDuixBaa	Honestly... it's because most guys don't know what to do with the emotion the movie evokes... we have trouble not only expressing emotion, but frequently can't actually identify what we feel; this usually improves with age and experience|`|NnlL3usKaa	lol they probably don't hate them, I think they are embarrassed about them, and in public, say they aren't fond of them, when in reality, they love chick flicks!|`|weMhsZUNaa	I'm a girl and I enjoy watching action or any movie really over chick flicks. Mostly they are very shallow and they are all alike.|`|McIUOEEiaa	The same reason why most of us girls don't like watching football. We just pretend we do and wonder how the guys know all the players and their stats.<br>  <br>  They aren't called "chick flicks" for nothing.|`|xkWCsxdtaa	I think dudes hate chick flicks because they are sometimes cheesy and stereotypical...there is always a happy ending. That's why I personally don't like chick flicks myself.|`|crBmcntyaa	they don't............. if word got out you'd actually realise most guys dont mind them but it would screw with their so called 'image'|`|MtzDCkgFaa	Unless they're gonna "get some" it's pointless. Hence, "Chick" flick. <br>  ;] <br>  <br>  it's just the truth though.|`|Y3PFT8f2aa	No, some guys do like them... I think they try to be all manly and dont watch it, so they dont end up crying. :)|`|2WiKH3Hkaa	Because no one gets killed and no one has quick and dirty sex in them.|`|3765e3159658220a8cc965318bdc4e05aa	Katie took the words out of my keyboard.|`|C8dNhpoKaa	I love Chick Flicks, Mean Girls is my favorite film.|`|sTKJkvFsaa	They don't understand them.|`|cfmU2H8Naa	(girl) the reasons are kindof odvious... they're guys?|`|EtSPbSzcaa	Cause nothing blows up theres no sex and people cry|`|UIgDmhnIaa	Im a guy, I dont mind chick flicks.|`|CFMmuZGNaa	they r 2 big headded 2 do anything a girl would do!@|`|yLuzqHInaa	Listen to yourself:guys dont like CHICK flicks! their girl movies,not guys.that says it all|`|rugfqD4Aaa	the tend to be extremely cliche|`|nVpnEhgOaa	Men Like To Watch Stuff With Action Guns Sports And Porn|`|zs4RiP9Daa	My names Allie just like in the notebook :D|`|YAuPx2kdaa	they are boring and lame|`|ZX5aVIA4aa	ur stupid.. its obvious. wow. they are meant for GIRLS!|`|8Z7tF9wuaa	they are chick flicks... look at the first word...

Why would they rather watch "The Notebook" instead of "Saving Private Ryan"?  We have different tastes.<br>  <br>  People enjoy watching movies that make them feel good (in general).  Guys like the macho, taking over the world and accomplishing things movies.  Girls like the finding the right guy and falling in love movies.<br>  <br>  It can be summed up with this quote:<br>  <br>  A woman's life is love.  A man's love is life.|`|kJ7mcPLbaa	Chick flicks are usually really bad. I am female, and I don't even watch that crap!<br>  <br>  Worst movie EVER made was: Titanic. It was complete rubbish!|`|y1jan1w1aa	*sigh*|`|IFXAlv7Uaa	Cuz they were meant for chicks, hence the name 'chick flick'|`|KTtLYrcZaa	i <3 chick flicks!! :) .. the notebook and a walk to remember are 2 of my favorite movies|`|N9HMovQ9aa	seriously i agree with the first answer they do have serious issues<br>  they'd rather watch movies like Saw or The Ring|`|R5mmX9Woaa	I don't know what their problems are, but i think it has something to do with the CHICK part of it.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	Well ask yourself why do you hate action movies?|`|nlbJAtuZaa	cuz they are guys|`|N1eWhoFJaa	Xtra B, is about right =]|`|YW1DXceqaa	i don't have a girlfriend|`|z5Hl6Bhtaa	Hmm.. my ex didn't mind chick flicks.

The older you get the more about fashion and makeup you learn. I think middle school is the "experimental" stage of a girls life. Try different things, read magazines to get beauty tips. Anybody, with the right advice, can be as pretty as she wants. It is a learning process. In high school you will give in to pressures and see what others are trying and doing. You do not want to give in to those pressure, because people will target you and hope you will fall for their jokes. Find out who you are and maybe ask your mom for beauty tips. You are pretty and have dark hair, dying it lighter will ruin it. Your teeth are nice, which is an awesome thing to have. Just use the right makeup, not too much though, people don't want to look fake. Maybe go to a makeup counter in a department store with your mom, they will show you what makeup is right for your skin. I did that once, and it was awesome. You don't want to go to dark, that will make you look OLD, like 30ish old, don't want that, keep it bright and young. Go to a salon to get waxing tips. You are beautiful. I hope I helped!|`|WuWyo1PXaa	I think you are pretty, and if you care for yourself even more you'll get even prettier/hot. I don't go up to a person and say, "Oh! You're pretty you must be really nice, or oh, you're ugly you must be a total jerk!" (I don't want you to think I am saying you have a bad personality or not. Trust me.)  I just think the main thing about someone is their personality not their looks.<br>  <br>  (I am not lesbo)|`|UJ1w74gdaa	I think your really pretty and have lots of character, by looking at the picture you look friendly and someone people would want to be around!<br>  <br>  and remember don't be negative, don't write it down or say it or type it, cause the more you do the more you'll get convinced that you are|`|9Gnm4PbNaa	I think that you are doing yourself a big injustice by asking people on the internet to validate your beauty. Trust me, as you get older, your priorities will change and you will look back and wonder why you turned to strangers to tell you that you are beautiful and hott.

This seems like a conversation that you should have with your mom or another woman that you can trust.|`|xgRgPkCiaa	Your are not hideous. I think you are pretty.

Jk, but seriously....The pull out method is effective, if used properly. That is to say, make sure no ejaculate is...er...expunged into the..uhh... vaginal area. LOL. The vagina produces it's own defense mechanism that kills most sperm. haha, I feel strange now. But always make sure you're secure with your partner and they have no STD's. One night stands and not being able to afford condoms, probably not too safe.|`|DBUmR8FTaa	If this is a serious question if you can't afford condom you shouldn't be having sex.

Pre-ejaculation sperm will come out before you actually come. I'm on birth control, but my friend didn't want to be on that so she used the pull-out method, and went to the health clinic for a check-up, and they told her they found traces of semen that could've caused pregnancy (all from this pull-out method.)

As a young girl I watched "Umbrellas of Cherbourg" and wept and sniffled throughout.<br>  <br>  When I was five, the king's death in "The King and I" made me cry uncontrollably for quite some time.  <br>  <br>  There are movies that make me cry, but not really from sadness; mainly by being manipulated by the music.  "ET" is one of those.  <br>  <br>  And there's a difference between being sad throughout, or just having a sad ending.  As far as being sad throughout, I'd say "Philadelphia."|`|JhJXKRkOaa	Bambi, Dumbo, Fox and the Hound, Might Joe Young, Black Beauty, Bridge to Terabithia, Titanic, My Girl, E.T, Step mom, Dante's Peak, Fly away Home,|`|tLI94qWNaa	That movie is sad:(  Here are some that make me cry <br>  <br>  The elephant man <br>  Schindler's list <br>  The pianist <br>  Pans labyrinth <br>  Life is beautiful|`|TW4MHCybaa	Mine was the documentary Super Size Me. ....

tLI94qWNaa	They are remaking the classic horror movie Suspiria (2010)  It is in  pre-production.  He is only the writer though, he is not directing this time.

Those things aside though, there might be a red mark or something.|`|6Y1A1UG7aa	It would really depend on how hard you are getting slapped.|`|RO0nhgPpaa	slightly purple or like a deep red but not like a giant lump|`|PW1vXqruaa	A hard slap will definatly raise a bruise and a somewhat lighter slap will create a reddish mark,outlining the fingers and palm.

Just browse and pick out a few you like, then go to www.harmonycentral.com and check out the reviews for them. They get excellent reviews, and I know some pro players who use them and love them.|`|m7rKEr19aa	Don't get Yamaha. They have no reason to be making instruments. They sound horrible and play craply. Fender is pretty good. But it all depends on the type of music you play. For Rock to the somewhat heavier stuff, Fender. For the real heavy stuff, B.C. Rich and Ibanez. Also do not get washburn. But it really depends on what you like. Hope I was helpfull.

ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	It's a high-pressured air gun that is used to kill cattle in slaughter houses. A captive bolt pistol (also variously known as a cattle gun, stunbolt gun, bolt gun, or stunner) is a device used for stunning animals prior to slaughter. Proper stunning is essential to prevent the pain and suffering of the animal during the bleeding process (which is itself necessary to prevent meat spoilage) during butchering. The principle behind captive bolt stunning is a forceful strike on the forehead using a bolt to induce unconsciousness. The bolt may or may not destroy part of the brain. In the movie, Anton may have had to carry around a canister of compressed air that weighed as much as fifty pounds when full.<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captive_bolt_pistol" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captive_bol...</a>|`|3e9012ba1dd534a806189223caad2b6baa	It shoots air at an extremely fast speed.

It should not be out of warranty.<br>  2) as long as you have the receipt, and all components, there should be no problem.<br>  As far as buying at Walmart.

Even  though the computer  company  denied  your  warranty  the store policy  should refund  your money  as  long as  you have  your  receipt   before 90 days is up.

Sarah's in a loveless marriage, long days with her young daughter at the park and the pool, wanting more. Brad is a househusband, married to a flinty documentary filmmaker. Ronnie is just out of prison - two years for indecent exposure - living with his mother; Larry is a retired cop, fixated on driving Ronnie away. Sarah and Brad connect, a respite of adult companionship at the pool. Ronnie and Larry have their demons. Brad should be studying for the bar; Larry misses his job; Ronnie's mom thinks he needs a girlfriend. Sarah longs to refuse to be trapped in an unhappy life. Where can these tangled paths lead?

There's sex scenes and topless women. People are killed in bizarre and gory ways.

oQaNYZxRaa	Chris Weitz will not direct the third film in the Twilight series, Eclipse, a source close to the production tells EW.com exclusively. Because New Moon, which Weitz is helming, and Eclipse are due to be released so close together (on Nov. 20, 2009, and June 30, 2010, respectively), Weitz will be in post-production on New Moon at the same time that Eclipse will be shooting. That said, the source confirms a report that the movies will not be shot simultaneously or back-to-back; there will be a brief gap between the production of both films. (Reporting by Adam B. Vary)|`|v0FlUan0aa	i hope they do! i love twilight!|`|34XCm07vaa	theyre not even filming new moon yet, pendejada. the director ran out on the pendejada. the granga made a good choice.|`|vXoKHSsjaa	Apparently they are and they are filming some at the same time of new moon to save expenses.<br>  I think it will be released under a year after November 2009 because that is when new moon is released.<br>  <br>  Buts thats ok if you can wait a year from twilight to new moon we can wait a year for new moons to eclipse :)<br>  <br>  xo|`|w5Vgx78Vaa	i dont think so as they left some time between new moon and twilight.<br>  <br>  They start filming in March for New Moon|`|DTbrNPsvaa	i don't think they will film it right after it probably 2 yrs from now since new moon will come out in November 2009|`|MTx8N6haaa	i dont know when or if they already started because eclipse comes out june 30, 2010. thats so fast :]|`|Hy3X8CMiaa	No right after... maybe a few months after... it should come out in 2010 :)<br>  They will start filming New moon in march :)|`|LXkGS7Q5aa	Yeah they are.....eclipse is going to come out in June or July of 2010!

1IWEKwznaa	It usually means the producers or the director felt there was not enough or it was too short. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a perfect exampl. The whole "I hate my father so your parents must be bad too so I can't let them in my factory." was either for length or because they felt there was not enough.

7ee11f32ce402e558134b3f3e6323823aa	Well, I think it is a personal choice. You can get hit by a car or struck by lightening at any moment. But you have to live.<br>  I personally was a bit paranoid because I was a single mom ,  and her dad was completely out of the picture and I did not want my family to raise my daughter under any circumstances. So I felt that I needed to stick around.<br>  I was signed up for skydiving lessons when I found out I was pregnant with my daughter. I cancelled them and never went back to it. I will be doing it sometime soon (now with my daughter , too...she's grown). =) We've been saying that for a while..we will get to it when the time is right. <br>  I also stopped going to concerts and partying (not because they were dangerous, just cause I was single working mom, so every moment I got to spend with my daughter was very precious). I did go out some , but not much..and I only went to 2 concerts the whole time she was growing up.<br>  I was also at a point in my life where I was considering switching back to my first career (police work). I chose not to because I didn't feel it was a good risk for me and my situation ..though I loved police work and had been a cadet for years prior. Also , my head/heart were no longer in it, which would be a very dangerous mistake. But, I think I would not have risked it , reglardless. I think it would have been different if I'd already been on the force.<br>  <br>  These were choices that I made because being a mom , and being a good mom, were extremely important to me.<br>  <br>  But I don't honestly think you can make a blanket judgment. Some things are as important to people as living and I think being good to yourself and not giving up your entire life makes you a better, more balanced parent.|`|wmBK9uASaa	They should take it easy and make the children do the dangerous stuff,|`|6k5fhFyBaa	I think it's irresponsible (to take severe/dangerous risks) when the children aren't independent from their parents. Obviously life is about taking risks, but they need to more calculated in this type of situation. Save those risky"gains" for when your children are capable of supporting themselves.<br>  <br>  People shouldn't have children if they don't have the intent of being around to take care of them. It's careless.|`|TjttzpPKaa	If that's what they enjoy, sure. Having a family doesn't mean a persons life should be Walton's Mountain and church on Sunday and 8-5 at your job, everyday for the rest of your "then to be" very boring life. I still climb cliffs. I skydive. I teach martial arts to kids involved in gangs, drugs, etc. to try and get them on the right path. My son is a test pilot at Edwards Air Force Base.. Life is about taking chances, not just in your everyday routine but in everything you do. I choose excitement in mine. I do not except being average and typical. I except spontaneity.|`|yQ0OzEbZaa	Everyone in our family has one of these and this has really reduced the worry.<br>  <a href="http://www.babble.com/CS/blogs/strollerderby/bubblewrap.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.babble.com/CS/blogs/strollerd...</a>|`|6mBpkt3Daa	No, because what if they died?

We also don't drink and eat a good diet and exercise as the second biggest cause is heart disease. <br>  <br>  But seriously I wonder how these guys:<br>  A)  sleep knowing they are causing their families so much worry.<br>  B)  Get insurance.<br>  <br>  Take Care|`|G4qG1Zakaa	What's the point of living if you're going to worry about dying?<br>  <br>  Should I go for a drive in the car because I might get in a car accident?|`|S2tBYhCKaa	If I jumped out of perfectly good flying aircraft for fun I'd expect<br>  something of equal spirit from family left behind .

BnTYoxUIaa	Nas is still good even with a crappy beat.|`|zfiplEmbaa	Reallly, IDK.....somehow he keeps thinking will I am's and Green Lanterns of the world will make him a hit someday|`|KoNHUcNUaa	DJ Premier is what Nas needs more than Kanye. Nas still has it ,but i think that he needs to make an album with Premier and classic east coast producers.|`|ioNTTqKfaa	I don't get why people think his beats are weak. He's not a party/pop rapper so he doesn't use those types of beats. To me Untitled had perfect beats because it wasn't a party album.|`|92iuiuZKaa	idk. but I think Nas is still good regardless of his beats|`|dOurKVdiaa	i wondered the same, maybe its a budget issue??|`|sOAOyue7aa	I agree with you (somewhat). Premo needs to do like half an album to make up for all the times hes been spurned since "Stillmatic". It seems like when Nas tries to go left field (Bridging the Gap, Sly Fox), or when he's working with unpopular producers (Black Republican), he sounds tired, and the music gets in the way of the lyrics in a bad way.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER, 'Ye has made two beats for Nas already (you must not have liked him), and his best songs lyrically have good beats to back them for the most part.<br>  <br>  By the way: If Premo get on the album, shouldn't Pete Rock (The World is Yours), Q-Tip (One Love), and Trackmasters (most of "It Was Written)?<br>  <br>  Peace,<br>  LCAS|`|v7hTlEkCaa	I don't think it matters anymore, Nas can walk away from rap right now and it would be widely known that he is one of the greatest emcees ever. Primo and Kanye already made beats for him, and the results shown, he murdered those tracks. Plus Nas is a street emcee and not a club rapper, so I don't think he cares about getting classic hits since he already has them.|`|bribxhsdaa	NaS doesn't need super produciton in the volume you're suggesting (I.e. an entire album). FYI, NaS has plenty of Classics on lyrics alone.

u7LSohRyaa	I feel that it's your responsibility to let him know he's fathered a child even if you don't know him. That doesn't really give him a right to tell you what to do together or with that child but he's got the right to know. The reasons you gave are not convincing enough to limit your communication on such an important subject. It's partly his child even if you don't know him. That could mean more to him then you know.|`|YLgdMXiQaa	yes i would tell him I think it would make the story more intresting to see the reaction or the man|`|AA12383000	Well if he is old enough to have sex then he is old enough to hear that he is about to become A father, yes this person needs to be open with her boyfriend, things don't have to be so difficult it's called team work.|`|pRXejsdXaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJlPEHL85Ig" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJlPEHL85...</a>|`|AyC8TJyfaa	hmmm wow i guess it really depends...not sure what i would do. but yes i would blame myself(him too)|`|o6uwV66jaa	if it's there child and someone got pregnant by having s(e)x with him..then yes absolutly..<br>  they desurve to know.|`|DwjFLJixaa	idk it depends.<br>  i might not tell them in person.<br>  but find out who they were and mail to them saying they have a child but i might not want them anything to do with the baby.|`|WwniGb7vaa	Find exactly what you want today.|`|UL1I46ylaa	thats a hard one....hmm if he was asian, i would.<br>  ahah jk jk jk jk<br>  umm i think i would.
ZmpbCxnAaa	It's ok when people just ask to boost their self-esteems a little.

I1K6SC43aa	I believe it CAN be.<br>  <br>  If both people are legal adults, I think age is just a number. However, the number can affect the maturity level of the individual. Most 50 year olds are more experienced in everything compared to a 20 year old. But there are some 50 year old men with the mind of 20 year olds. And some 20 year olds with the mind of 50 year olds. <br>  <br>  In the end, it all boils down to the maturity level of both people.|`|iFTa9FqZaa	well there comes a point when it does matter...like considered rape and such, and maturity level<br>  <br>  example...78 year old man wants to have an exclusive relationship with a 12 year old girl<br>  ...do you think that's wrong? i would say yes|`|spfftUvUaa	Not me. What happens if a 21 year old dates a three year old. Think about it.|`|20dfea55369b7c48d3aa2ed4fee31352aa	I think age does matter. I'm fourteen but the oldest i would ever date is like 18 or 19|`|JACkBYeKaa	i don't think it is unless its a huge difference like someone that is 45 and 82 - this is actually true there is a kid in my school his mom is 45 and his dad is 82 O.o|`|eta0c25yaa	well if a 5 year old is dating a 40 year old man then yes that is a problem.

It's just the commitment that comes along with it.<br>  <br>  <br>  As long if the age range is reasonable|`|DdYTRUmHaa	It's only a number if you're both legal.|`|UC2rLMONaa	Nah, I don't either. I would never date anyone more than 7 years older than me.|`|a31kUn1Naa	Depends. I mean there is a point where it is illegal. So. Yeah that is when it matters.|`|XEvK4urxaa	its not|`|HuhI1IlJaa	i don't really believe that 100% but to some extent, it's true|`|Xvq1cFZKaa	oh yeah! well wat about a 26 year old going out with a 15 year old??<br>  wat do u think of that?|`|Bc4RNrfwaa	It's not...|`|rAfg747daa	Not to me but i like to date people around my age or a couple years older, but not to much older.|`|IMwLfHQvaa	age isnt just a number.<br>  That is so weird how 20 year olds would go out with someone 50.<br>  that could be their father

wmBK9uASaa	Without a doubt there is,|`|AA11569882	Well, sure there is.  But it's there for a reason.  I mean, you can't have men and women playing rugby together can you, it's not sexist, it's just common sense.  And many games take physical strength that isn't natural for a woman to have.  Sometimes I think people go a bit far with this whole sexism thing - there is a difference between men and women, no point in denying it.|`|bIouq64Oaa	Yes. It seems like we're expected to excel at ballet and volleyball and girly stuff, like we can't be tough. I play soccer, and I'll have you know, some of those girls are freaking SCARY. Uni-brows and all. And I have never been knocked down by one of them. But whenever I play soccer at school with guys my age, I can usually knock them down easily.|`|VvX51zueaa	I think there is sexism. Cycling is a good example.

ojEkgJoqaa	if you have to ask that than you have an addiction|`|yB3Jek85aa	addiction is when you can get enough of something and you get sick if you don't get if.    <br>  <br>   love is when you care about sombody close to you and your willing the risk your life to save them|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	Love you have love well pretty much the same.,|`|iAPHAAinaa	Love is symbiotic; when two people love each other, both receive joy and happiness from the other. When someone loves music, they practice and perform it and enrich the lives of themselves and others with their instruments. If someone loves to travel, then they get to see beautiful sights and become cultured in the ways of the world while the airline and hotel companies make money off of them. Addiction, however, is not symbiotic; it is parasitic and negative. Ask a heroin addict if they love to shoot up. My guess is that they'll love the feeling they get from it, but they don't love the fact that they can't stop doing it. Ask someone with an addiction to pornography if they love to watch porn; they'll probably tell you they wish they could stop but just can't. Love heals and helps; addiction hurts and destroys. That is the main difference.|`|tT6GMdHiaa	there arent much differences<br>  Love is an addiction|`|NSF23k3Uaa	I'd say its about the same.|`|128833184801fb3ff90fe4b271c5a6efaa	I think love is driven more by care and a genuine like for a person.  You might miss them, but you know how to be your own person without them and with them, for that matter.  <br>  <br>  I think addiction is more where you don't know how to function without the person, and you need to know everything about them all the time.  I think addiction can become stalking more easily than love.|`|xYqrCYuFaa	when youre taken away from an addiction you go through withdrawals-<br>  shaking, convulsing, throwing up<br>  <br>  when youre taken away from a love you go through heartbreak- crying, drinking (which ironicall results in addiction) and pain.<br>   <br>  :]|`|pZSZUhXNaa	love is healthy and an emotion.<br>  addiction is a need to feed something empty inside.  it is unhealthy.|`|Sv4E2o6uaa	love is a profoundly tender, passionate affection for another person<br>  <br>  addiction is compulsive physiological and psychological need for a habit-forming substance|`|D8sN8gNFaa	Love can fade. Addiction lasts until you choose to stop it, or until it kills you.|`|JU26EGAeaa	sex is involved|`|cBxG0BbZaa	love - is real<br>  addiction - u need help|`|lfJ5Jxxwaa	love cost more money|`|MR9jlurbaa	Addiction is where you are connected to something that is harmful to you.<br>  Love is where you really really like something, but you don't NEED it.  You can control your emotions toward it.  when it comes to addiction, you can't control your emotions, you have to have what it is that you are addicted to it, and it is bad for you|`|cLU6nGWwaa	When you love someone, you know it will be okay if you let them go. If you are addicted, it would be much harder. <br>  If you love someone, you have enough trust to let them be. If you are addicted, you call every hour to see what that person is doing.<br>  Love is a part of everyones life. It is barely a choice. Addiction is a choice. If you are smart, you choose not to become addicted to anything, including a person.<br>  Love doesn't need fame or fortune. All you need is yourself and the person (or thing) you love. With addiction, it usually costs money and time.<br>  Love is healthy. Addiction isn't.<br>  But, in a sense, some addictions become a love. If you are addicted to meth, you may become in love with it.|`|nUU9U9Asaa	Love is a feeling that you get for someone.<br>  Addiction is when you can't get enough of something.<br>  For example:<br>  My brother smokes Marijuana,<br>  He loves it, but isn't addicted to it.<br>  He smokes it once in a good while when<br>  he doesn't feel good.<br>  He can stop whenever he wants to, <br>  he doesn't NEED it!|`|2I5nYge4aa	Nothing.<br>  Love is a biochemical in the brain that induces a powerful addiction/obsession.

Luckily for me, I was driving on a one way highway, but I happened to look both ways at a rail road crossing, and there was a truck driving on the train tracks.  I guess they were doing maintenance.  I am not sure if that is being pessimistic, or just extra safe.

If you remember what you read right away learn by internet, if you learn best with a teacher learn that way.<br>  <br>  I learned by internet through many sites.<br>  <br>  here are two of them<br>  <br>  <a href="http://rockbass-beginnertoproinfourweeks.com/" rel="nofollow">http://rockbass-beginnertoproinfourweeks...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.studybass.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.studybass.com/</a><br>  <br>  It also would help to have private lessons if you think you will be to lazy to teach yourself. There was also a guy called Dmanlamius76 on Youtube who will help. He has a lot of helpful videos.<br>  <br>  don't teach yourself with just learning songs, that is a big mistake. Learn some songs, but also learn about chords and scales for at least a little each day. It will be boring at first but you will thank yourself later. Who knows, you may become famous.|`|nZba18Lpaa	I think teaching urself builds great character. I taught/teacvhing myself bass fr about a year now and will never regret it. Ill make a few sugestions fr you and your parents- Buy either an Ibanez Fender or Yamaha bass, an Acoustic brand amp, and a monster cable. Now i play an Ibanez SRX series 4 String. I also suggest u buy a 4 string and teach urself by using tabs. Here are a few websites:<br>  <br>  www.BassMasta.com<br>  www.UltimateGuitar.com<br>  <br>  Teach urself songs that you like and dont use a pick or buy a Squire by Fender!!! Well good luck and Peace!|`|CXgPkEPFaa	private lessons by far! And get a job lol!

Maybe that’s because psychologically it is known to have a calming effect. Or maybe it’s because pink is complimentary to most skin tones, unless you already have a lot of pink tone in your skin. Or maybe it’s because a man who wears pink exudes confidence, yet is sensitive. It could be as simple as the fact that pink is easy to coordinate with almost every color in your wardrobe--it goes amazingly well with grays, tans, black, navys and other blues tones. And lastly, if you're still not convinced how great pink is, women love pink and are more likely to give you a second glance. So give pink a try if you haven’t already.|`|NfSz1VBZaa	Real men do wear pink...they look hot, too.

XnTdmC5Naa	Simona, that was absolutely hilarious.<br>  <br>  <br>  Luckily, I can say I don't really have any embarrassing stories.<br>  <br>  My most embarrassing was when I was giving a report and the topic changed to stem cell research and I ended up talking about cloning. I felt like such a dumbass.|`|3AAHmvKFaa	Oh dear. =[ That's awful. <br>  I've had many embarrassing moments. One is when I was also 14 I was in school and suddenly the chair collapsed so I fell right through. Then when I got my self up I hit my head on the door and then someone tripped me up.<br>  Sounds totally made up but I swear it happened.<br>  [=|`|PbLuxnzdaa	When my older brothers friend walked in on my changing into my bathing suit, i was completely naked! SO embarassing, he like stumbled out of the door AH<br>  or at the school dance when i was dancing with this older guy and apparently my top had fell down on one shoulder so my bra was out in the open! then to make matters worse hes like "Hey, your bras showing." i was so embarassed and he just kept staring.|`|K4bJgTF4aa	when i was 10 and i was in dance class...and i got my head stuck in between the ballet bar and the wall.  and it hurt.  but yours sounds awful! eeek.  but i try not to get myself into situations that could be potentially embarrassing.  oh and i have another one..but it is way too embarrassing to post on line. lol so ill just stick with that one.|`|DRzezllQaa	hahahahahahahahah sucks for you hahahahahahahahaha
7b5CfjeWaa	nooo.|`|LrGZcI6yaa	well, yes, and no. I'm a guy, and If I was you, I would still like to go on another date. I'm sure he'd forgive you, and even though it was kind of mortifying, I know you guys should have a 2nd date.<br>  <br>  Btw, If you have another date, I don't think he would want you to sit on his lap, lol!|`|hEFthejvaa	i don't think it would be up to you. you'd have to wait & see if he wants to go out again. if he doesn't say anything then pretend like it never happened. do you still talk to him?<br>  but don't worry everyone has there share of embarrassing dates throughout their life. hopefully you learned you're lesson.|`|OocDN5evaa	If he was great, why would you question going on another date with him? I would think he'd have to be the one to question a second date, not you.|`|yeK9KSP1aa	Oh hell no! I'm sorry that happened to you but if I was the guy I would be traumatized.<br>  <br>  That's a straight-up Super bad moment.|`|GJb2OSrnaa	yea, its natural, kinda sux with the timing...but yea|`|d5COR2S2aa	wow........ sucks dude *pat pat* (altho it was 4 yrs ago)|`|4oeBAHANaa	no i would dissapear.<br>  (at least to him.... I would die..)|`|IgIlAiO5aa	lol yes, it was an accident, you may be embarassed but it is something that happens and he should accept that too|`|CNSGz12zaa	Why not..**** happens. If he likes you he wouldn't care. No sense in crying over a little spilt blood.|`|fhLXLG4Naa	LMAO NO.|`|sTZQWiGlaa	That's nice.|`|wY4PmhHFaa	u should have been wearing a tampon that time|`|oZO8ALgCaa	no unless the guy really likes u|`|u1e22TTJaa	no.<br>  probably not..<br>  <br>  but that depends.. <br>  HOW cute was he..??<br>  <br>  lol.|`|31c6e7ea3d747d7f34c094f42d5f9435aa	Well first of all, a guy who was that age probably wouldnt want to go on another date with you, but now, it being 4 years later, I'm afraid 18 y/o guys arent much more mature than when they were 14 (I know this - I am now 30). In the perfect world, yes - it was a biological accident that was totally out of your control and certainly as accident. <br>  <br>  Second...your question is a little vague. Are you asking if YOU would go back on a date with HIM, or the other way around?<br>  <br>  If its YOU, theres no reason not to go if he asked you, this would suggest he actually is mature enough to look past something that happened 4 years ago. If its HIM, chances are he is still immature and cant forget the incident.|`|9Dz7Vi43aa	if I were the girl<br>  I'd make sure I bring lots of pads to the dates in the future :P but yea if he wanted I would <br>  <br>  as the guy.. I'm not sure<br>  if you were really nice and I was comfortable around you, then yes, since you cant control your period, but if I was already not sure if I want a second date, that would convince me not to even try|`|5O7dYY0taa	as a guy<br>  <br>  i'd say that was rly gross<br>  <br>  but i'd understand cause us guys have to let that stuff go if we ever wanna be a good boyfriend.<br>  <br>  so yeh i'd go on another date if i felt that it was all good.|`|7at1Hyn8aa	If he asked you out, sure.  Obviously he got over that little embarrassment. <br>  If you want to ask him out, I'm not so sure.  This is obviously not something you can easily forget.|`|vdcUYLztaa	My lord.<br>  <br>  Things like that just aren't supposed to happen...<br>  <br>  But if I REALLY did like the person A LOT (even though it was the first date) then maybe... I'd have to sleep on it... not before I took a hundred showers though.|`|m8Czd9Daaa	yeah definetly.<br>  something like that shouldnt keep people apart.<br>  i know it was your first date but seriously, get over it.<br>  it was an accident.<br>  what can you do about it?|`|CqJ1UQWiaa	my goshh.. i don't think i would, even if he asked me to go out again. What if in the future he decides to tell that story as a joke. man.. i would jump into a hole.|`|BbaR8Hhqaa	If i was guy, probaly not.<br>  If i was a girl, i would to terrified to talk or see the guy again, so no.|`|hu8o4vomaa	this sounds like a joke, but honestly I think if that happend the best you can hope for is to be friends|`|AA11791082	I would never date again.

Its natural. Can girls control it? Im a guy so i wouldnt know|`|KQPaJlBEaa	your not supposed to do that. that was bad and i will be suprised if your reputation is not horribly ruined you might as well shave your head and change your name to agatha. yahooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo... btw plz do not click on the link i sent you unless you want to be really really really really really really want to be popular|`|5e222e64f1d8a945c888f07f0b21e0e4aa	Well I would have never put myself into that kinda position in line of letting girl sit on my lap (It gets the motors going for no reason) ...but I would say nobody has control of many natural functions of the body...I would say yes if we hit it off.|`|Dz38f4wmaa	hells to the yeah,  just cause some awkward moment happened on the first date shouldn't mean that you have to miss out on a really nice person.  Plus that could become a joke, and a funny story.  It will make awkward moments in the future easier.|`|I021AfMbaa	It is unique things like this that happen that make memories last a lifetime. I would have gone on a second date with the you no questions asked. It is a natural part of being a woman.|`|UMa3jvRHaa	wow that stinks.<br>  But if you really liked the guy then i would ttly go for it....<br>  dont let something that happened in the past keep you from missing out on the great things that could happen.|`|YYIDrv1raa	yeah that would totally suck but if you like the guy and he likes you just try to make it a joke of some time. like i was just marking my territory. something and let it go if it even comes up|`|orIm38DEaa	well if he forgave you and you wern't two embarrased.<br>  <br>  <br>  answer mine   <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ajmzj9dYBt7qYZhXZ9XUAazsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222133827AADDRZ0">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|nOy7F3ilaa	If he was totally worth it and you could just shake it off and laugh about it with him then...Yes, I would.|`|I4flPE5Saa	oh... i would be embarrassed but would the second date be with the guy you had your period on or a different guy?|`|WwGwLW3Zaa	It depends on the guy if he wasn't a jerk about it or ran around telling his friends then I would because that obviously means he respects you and your feelings.|`|AA10152411	**** happens. And periods.|`|AA11508777	HAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA...|`|ZjKXPjndaa	i would first talk to him!!and then if he says its ok to go on a nother date then do it! that must have realy sucked when that happen!|`|RuwnxfZCaa	yeah, he just probably blew that incident off his mind. besides, he knew that wasn't your fault.|`|nUuK9Aglaa	i'm a giiiirl.<br>  omg! no!<br>  i'd be way too embarrassed.|`|tUZLoTmsaa	oh geezzz...that sucks|`|Pxvl8vuzaa	he would have to ask you out again lolol<br>  thats horrifying!|`|oDIXisxnaa	yes u can wash blood away but u cant wash ur love away.|`|mcymZfuAaa	O wow.

hkdP9Rtyaa	Its not really normal, there is no such thing as a normal person in my opinion, because everybody is different. Yeah, I am same, I have days when I feel so good about myself, that I feel so comfortable in my own skin and that I wouldn't want to change a thing about myself, even my imperfections. <br>  However, I do have days when I just want escape this world, because of the fear of other people's perception of me. That is when I want to say nothing, when I am so painfully shy. Sometimes I get so scared to even say anything to anyone. Sometimes, I get scared when I walk into a crowded room, just because of the fear of being noticed. But I keep telling myself, that I am who I am. <br>  Hold your head up high, stare life in it's face and keep on smiling.<br>  That's what I do. There is no point holding back.|`|384jaNQoaa	Your totally normal, it will depend on the day you are having what your mood is, also what you have going on that day will change your mood. i.e. if you are totally swamped with work load then you may feel smaller, once you finish that work load you could be confident.|`|yLmeZMTWaa	Totally normal|`|13696281d4bfaa532acde67008e9d4d7aa	Normal|`|TEPHIk8Oaa	Thats exactly how I feel at times xD<br>  But I consider myself weird.|`|89ff8fa4f5283b5a62c3ea573df41106aa	Yeah I get that sometimes!|`|yOc9EfL0aa	am the same so if thats not normal then it looks like where both weird|`|23uqWaeJaa	I am exactly the same.|`|j4rirb8laa	That's normal.

jK5FXm6Naa	Hmm I don't like the sound of that, but nobody and I do mean nobody should ever make you leave your home!<br>  I they carry on you should keep reporting them to the police, if the police turn out to be useless (which is quite a high probability) then the next bet would be to call the local council who can send out wardens.<br>  If that fails, i'd get loads or rotten eggs and aim for em like your in a competition in the olympics!<br>  They can't do anything when your inside!<br>  Hope it gets better for you, good luck!|`|wh3EJtZeaa	What a freak!! He is harassing you, so I would get the police involved (or an older brother to knock him out) Also make a record of all his pestering, maybe record the noise.

The sad thing is that the nice guys are worse towards me than the bad-not-my-type boys. I don't like bad boys or perverts, but sadly, I am a magnet to them. It's not that the bad boys are truly attracted to me; I am just someone they want to use and hurt. The nice guys, I don't know what it is about me that they don't like, because honestly, I'm nice too. I don't want to sound as if I'm honoring myself by saying I'm nice, but that's the truth. The nicer they are, the more they seem to can't stand me. <br>  <br>  It's to the point now where I'm convinced I'm going to be a life-long bachlorette who will never find out what it would be like to have a man to truly love me. That there isn't no one out there for me. And I'm pretty guarded of myself now.

When Mom was backing the car out of the driveway, she used to ask me to look and see if she was going to hit The Bank behind us.

To me, The Bank was where we drove thru and the nice lady behind the glass would give us a lollipop when Mom did a transaction. <br>  <br>  Yet, I would always look behind me when she asked.  I always said no, because I could never see any Bank back there....  lol.

cWNAhAQ3aa	firstly - she wasn't racist <br>  <br>  she called shilpa a poppodumn - which is only a relation to a food<br>  and a paki - isn't that like calling me a brit?<br>  <br>  second - she is riddled with a killer virus, has 2 children and has a (now husband) in jail - really, you cant help but feel sorry for her|`|pXbWYhTtaa	i have never hated jade. i dont think she was racist, i think she was a bully and i felt sorry for shilpa, but i think there are very very few people in this world who can say they have NEVER bullied someone... i think everyone has a some point in their life, even if it was just on one occassion. i think the whole thing was blown totally out of proportion and britain lets people get away with claiming racism for everything way too much, its getting beyond a joke. i dont worship her for dying so publicly either, but i do feel very sorry for her and hope her last days are as comfortable as possible. people also feel for her two young sons who are going to have to grow up with out their mother. anyone who has seen someone die to cancer will know how horrible it is, and i could never think someone deserves to die like that, unless perhaps they are a murderer or the like... but yeah, i think your a dick and need to learn to have a bit of compassion... i think people also need to remember that she is araising awareness for cervical cancer and the number of smear tests have increased dramatically, she essentially is saving lives...|`|eTx3Nfd7aa	to answer your question i never hated her over the race issue as i think jo and shilpa where as bad as her.i never really liked her cos she is a gobby uncouth yob.and i do feel sorry for her and her family as no one deserves to go what she is going through but i wish she wouldn't do it so publicly there is no need to turn it into a circus which i think she is doing.|`|DozD8lTGaa	I have liked Jade Goody from the FIRST Big Brother she was in. Then when she was on the Celeb BB and done the 'racist' remark. I didn't find it offensive... or racist. But, people have different views. AND!, Jade's Dad was mixed race (i know that she still can be Racist but, i don't think she was being racist)<br>  <br>  it never made me hate her. i have liked her all along. and i am SO sad that she has like 1 month to live. i feel so sorry for her.<br>  <br>  all those that have nasty hateful things about her, need to stop being so vile and have a heart... leave her alone!<br>  <br>  x<br>  <br>  <br>  AND THE REASON SHE IS DOING IS PUBLICLY IS BECAUSE, SHE WANTS TO RAISE AS MUCH MONEY AS POSSIBLE FOR HER CHILDREN!! WHY ELSE DO YOU THINK SHE IS DOING IT. ARRRGH, SOME PEOPLE ARE SO IGNORANT :@! SHE IS ALSO MAKING THIS ILLNESS MORE AWARE TO PEOPLE ANYWAY... THE DOCTORS DIDN'T PICK IT UP; SHE HAD THE CANCEROUS CELLS SINCE 16, THEY REMOVED THEM A NUMBER OF TIMES, THEN SHE WENT BACK A FEW YEARS AGO AND THEY STILL MISSED IT! SO SHE IS MAKING IT KNOWN TO PEOPLE THAT THINGS LIKE THIS COULD HAPPEN!|`|7gfNIajYaa	'''manipulated'''???b!tch I am the media,Im a journalism student.<br>  I think its only natural that someone can feel sorry for her,we are all gonna die one day,but she pretty knows when,probably where,and how. She has two young sons.<br>  I actually never said anything bad about her when she was in the CBB house,I just genuinely found her annoying and loud. But again,we are all humans,capable of mistakes and redemption's,living and dieing,confronting and forgiving.<br>  You sound so stupid when you word your question with the worship.<br>  Stop being such a b!tch and get on with your life you sadact.|`|JOAPnhOgaa	silpa shetty admitted that jade's comments were not of a racist manner<br>  that whole thing was made way too big to actually what it was<br>  <br>  never had a problem with this girl<br>  <br>  but even if i did i will give her respect in this hard time<br>  <br>  why are you so bitter? what has she done to u????<br>  <br>  .|`|3AAHmvKFaa	I.|`|HmqHf3qDaa	as you so so will you reap<br>  hope your cancer will not be such a shock to you,|`|JafMj9LVaa	Do you really think people ''worship'' her because she is dying publicly? No. Are you that naive? Nobody deserves to go through what she is, she is trying to make sure her two young sons dont go hungry in the future and are financially secure and i applaud her for that, it shows a caring mother and secondly she is rasing awareness of cervical cancer which so happens to be the 2nd biggest killer of women in the UK and since her diagnosis, getting checked out has gone up by 20% Did you know that? She is not doing this for herself. You obviously have no heart or brain if you think she is doing this for more fame.|`|ZCo6OFToaa	You sound like a very bitter person!|`|lnUrm4sGaa	oh arnt you just full of the joys of spring like not|`|it3ecbVEaa	re you jealous of her or something, because she has made a name for herself, oh i see you are trying to make a name for yourself by asking all these vile questions about her...<br>  <br>  i have not been duped, i like her and have done from the first time i saw her on bb,,  <br>  <br>  she is dying you idiot,her children are losing their mother, her mother is losing her daughter, and her new husband is losing his wife.. to the most horrible disease anyone could have..|`|eHUXcYZhaa	I still think she is racist and highly uneducated and ignorant. A lot of that is due to her circumstances and childhood. I certainly think all this media attention that she is courting is very distasteful and unnecessary. However if it helps promote awareness of cervical cancer and encourages more women to get checked out then that can only be a good thing. It is very sad for her because she is so young and because she has young children but I am not and will not become a fan of hers simply because she is dying.|`|9ADVLFOnaa	1. I don't read Hello<br>  2. I haven't been manipulated<br>  3. I don't like racism no matter who it is<br>  4. I wouldn't wish that on her or her innocent children <br>  5.

Feck off|`|93e0b2a4a6386ee080ab833cbe57167eaa	first of all i never hated her,she's made mistakes like all of us only her mistakes have been captured on film and showed to the public...i feel for her in the same way i would feel for anyone dying at such a young age,especially leaving kids behind
49gugL8maa	You shouldn't have to, but it is simple why. Because as long as there are people, there will be conflicting ideas, and some will say one thing is right and the others will say another. You will always have to defend a decision, because there will always be people who have the opposite idea and will fight about it. <br>  <br>  P.S. the hair sounds cool.|`|j2Ca8sgjaa	You're right-if you're happy that's fine. I'm just surprised you could be happy knowing everywhere you go people will think "look at that 40 y/o trying to act like she's 16. Gross"|`|gUdlaaGwaa	Ignore them. You can do what you like with your hair.|`|oeeT4Zlqaa	I do agree that you should be able to do what you want to do, but you have to know the consequences. Maybe your mom told you to grow up because dying your hair one of the most unnatural colors-pink- is something a lot of teens do as a spur of the moment kind of thing. Plus your 17 year old might feel embarrassed when his friends see his 35 year old mom with pink hair.|`|DdYTRUmHaa	Wow, I wouldn't let my mom leave the house with pink hair. You have a son, don't make him feel ashamed of you. <br>  <br>  I don't know where you're from, but I don't even see TEENS with pink hair where I'm from, much less adults.|`|aLMSN18xaa	Slap the taste out of your son for calling you a fat clown then give your mother a wedgie and ask her: how this for being grown up?<br>  then have a victory smoke.|`|ARGrcebdaa	You go Girl!  You put up with your moms opinions all your life while she raised you.  That's not a bad thing.  Moms are supposed to train us.  Walk away from any arguments with her.  She's your mom.  <br>  <br>  You raised your son to be respectful and decent and his calling you a fat clown deserves to have him cook his own food and clean his own whatever.  Tell him he wouldn't want a fat clown doing things for him.  See how he likes that.  <br>  <br>  As long as your employer doesn't have a problem with it then neither do I.  <br>  <br>  Ask your fat *** son if he has a job and a place to stay.  If he doesn't tell him he can call you a fat clown when he does.  Make sure he sends money.    <br>  <br>  Oh yeah!  Tell him you still love him even though he is incredibly ignorant.  (smiling)|`|MUuKSFgvaa	You won't have to ask questions like these, if you start acting your age. Sorry, but it's the truth. I'm 15 and I think that for a woman almost as old as my mom you are extremely immature.

Hzf3QK9faa	Never heard any botched versions of O Canada! Jonathan Maracle sang a few years back at Canada celebrations in Ottawa and sang  a Mohawk song of his called Kanata, the Mohawk name for Canada, which means the village. That was an awesome song/performance.

I broke mine when I was a junior in high school. Yes, it is embarrassing, but more so if you don't get it covered immediatey. Plus you could be exposing the nerve!<br>  <br>  The dentist will "fill it in with this substance that will mold almost like your tooth did. It'll be like that for a while until you get temporary caps. Then they'll make a permanent crown for you that will be so natural you'll never be able to tell it is not your real tooth.

I've only been there once and it was right along the border so I have not much to judge about the people. <br>  I know a bit, not a ton, I know the capital is Ottawa and the languages are English and French mostly.

Very clean, friendly people, and diverse. We're lucky to have Canada as a close ally and trading partner.<br>  <br>  As for the culture, I was surprised to see how similar the Canadians are to we Americans.<br>  It shouldn't be a shock since most of the Canadian population lives so close to the US border, but when I think of Canadian culture, the very first thing that pops in my head is France.|`|J9EUVqKvaa	Love: The people are really nice and polite, you have beautiful mountains and landscapes, your flag is cool looking, hockey is awsome, you haven't been involved in a war in a long time.<br>  <br>  Hate: its REALLY COLD!!

Enough said.|`|4SGBr8cWaa	i have lots of canadian friends & i love you guys. i'm in michigan,eh!|`|rJgrwIodaa	I imagine it's not much different from us.  I ran into a few Canadians when I was in Ireland, and I thought they were American.  They sounded more American than the people in the state I live in.  They also told me quite a bit about where they were from in Canada and it almost sounded like a mini paradise.  Apparently it's warmer in parts of Canada than it is in parts of the states!  I'm jealous, but I suppose I could just move south.<br>  On the other hand, my state borders Canada and many people have mixed opinions.  Some hate Canadians because they come down here to shop and cause chaos.  Some love Canada because they can cross the border to get drunk when they turn 18.  My favorite word in Canada is "about".|`|XLQ9wCUaaa	Americans don't think about Canada NEARLY as much as Canadians think about the US.<br>  <br>  But to answer your question, Americans find you cute, drunk and hockey-loving. They envy that you have affordable doctors, but have more wealth and power than you.|`|R5tF14Bbaa	Well the one place in the world that i want to visit is actually Saskatchewan! I have personally never been to Canada but i would love to!

I have no clue who this new guy is but he is fugly as hell.|`|5faa7df1dbf6be8d22c72f7cca966e7baa	He was much better looking before he visited a plastic surgeon for a nip/tuck on his face.

At least the Jonas Brothers don't take nude photos and "accidentally" leak them all over the internet. <br>  But then again, the Jonas Brothers are always preaching about their stupid abstinence rings.|`|R8iz9ZM1aa	welll i would say miley <br>  <br>  she has releast 2 3d movies and is coming out with another one hahah|`|AA10668250	True but Miley always talks like shes got something in her mouth.

It's a classic and very versatile series, with a lot to recommend them, especially the music.  Link's Awakening on the original game boy has a special place in my heart because it's the first I played, but I also really like the dark feel of Twilight Princess- can't wait to get a Wii so I can play that one all the way through.  Zelda/Sheik is also my favourite Smash Bros character.|`|1MWPKTLoaa	i used to play it when i was little. my brother still plays it. i liked the main character....i forgot his name, but i loved that game!!|`|PM808Qjkaa	i don't have them anymore but I liked the one where you could hit the chickens like 3 times........then a mob of them took you out!|`|hu8o4vomaa	never played it|`|7b5CfjeWaa	not anymore..forgot characterz|`|nklXfvalaa	i used to play it like two years ago <br>  but my 19 year old brother still plays it|`|DA5ZbYjlaa	I played the first two on the old NES, but I haven't played either of them in years.|`|HBh9x2Tzaa	Favorite Game- The Wind Waker. <br>  Favorite Character- Ganondorf.|`|szLtwO2Qaa	Yeah, I still play the old Ocarina of Time on the 64.

MnXmSGPRaa	Yes, definitely. Personality matters wayyy more than looks. I'd love to meet a guy like him.|`|VRujBBYtaa	I don't find Edward all that handsome. Girls are different, some go for looks, some go for personality, some go for both. I usually like a guy for his personality, but if he's like super ugly then I'd probably just be friend with him.

YPdN0GHJaa	in the end, bella wanted edward to bite her and make her a vampire, so he leaned in with her expecting him to bite her right then but instead he kisses her. i think he kisses her 1 or 2 times. no, she doesnt become a vampire but shes trying to talk edward into turning her into one. then it goes to where it looks like ur looking out a window down on edward and bella then it shows victoria heading down some stairs with what looks like a tear-stained face with an evil look/smirk on her face and shes dressed up for the prom|`|jwiko3qQaa	James fights Edward, James bites Bella, Edward sucks venom out, Alice and others come in and kill James, Bella wakes up in a hospital, Eddy promises to stay, they go to prom, they talk about her wanting immortality, it appears he is going to bite her but ends up kissing her, scene pulls away to see Victoria watching them and fades to the credits, leaving it wide open for New Moon this winter. =)|`|53ykpihwaa	no she doesn't edward says not to and to enjoy her life but i'm goin to tell u in one of the books she and edward have a baby and the baby breaks open her stomach and she almost dies but edward bites her and she turns into a vampire|`|91f9c1a082323a5a5a46fb06dbe20d0daa	No, she becomes a vampire in Breaking Dawn.

KkZE2NDYaa	There are no formulas for writing music. If you can't find a melody you like, try approaching the song from a different way. Start with a chord progression you find interesting, or a rhythm that sticks in your head and improvise over the top of it. Or start with a lyric and find how it wants to roll off your tongue, then write a melody that follows that. Use some of the pain you feel inside as inspiration. People won't feel sorry for you if you write something angry. And lots of songs are about being sad. That is why people relate to them. Don't over analyze your music. Go ahead and finish something then come back to it later and see how you feel about it. Finally, songwriting is like anything else. You tend to get better with experience. You can do it. Good luck.|`|RwXTJiTMaa	I know what you mean -- you don't want to pour out your heart and sound all corny, because that's not the kind of music you're going for.<br>  <br>  This may sound really simple, but I found that it's the best way to challenge your creative writing skills (it actually helped me graduate college as an English major). <br>  <br>  We all have a writing process -- think about yours. For example, I usually write the words to something first, then I try to find a tune. Whatever your strategy is -- turn it on it's head. Do what you do last first. Change everything up! Again, it sounds really simple but it's surprisingly helpful.<br>  <br>  Another helpful thing I found (especially when I had to write a song or poem by a deadline) was a little book called "The Writers' Block." It's literally a block-shaped book, and each page just has a picture/quote/idea/story/etc. It really jump-starts your thought process -- even if you don't end up using what you write, it's great exercise. Obviously I'm not trying to sell you the book -- so my suggestion is to make your own. Either find a website that has suggestions (there are many) or just surf the web. One thing my friend loves to do is begin a sentence in google (with quotes around it) and use the results. A good example to start is: "___(your first name)___ looks just like". You will find some funny answers ((my name is Lindsay, so I get some great Lohan sentences))!<br>  <br>  Hope that helps some!|`|g11ejE2laa	If you mean writing songs/lyrics:<br>  Most writers can't just write a classic, most songs are based on a situation the writer has gone through. So if you're having trouble writing, wait for something significant to happen. Then write about it. <br>  Then sing it to yourself, and try to find the notes that would go with it.<br>  Now for just plain instrumental music.<br>  I don't know.<br>  But I hope I somewhat helped.

DTPERfnBaa	thats what i heard. i wonder if it is true|`|dlqa6yFkaa	What do you mean "for a price"? They sell them off to the highest bidder so they both leave and live elsewhere or you have to pay for a wife and then go and live in their community?  I can't make sense of it.<br>  Why would they sell them off and they leave and why would you pay to live with them if you don't believe what they believe?|`|AA10450505	Not true. The Holy Bible dictates the day to day practices of these good people, and promiscuity is an abomination. Sorry you heard such sad and mean talk.|`|7isjo3DAaa	omg that is like idk rude mean? lol dun ask me|`|XoNuUrYoaa	No!<br>  <br>  The Amish only intermarry amongst their selves and will only have family after marriage, so therefore  they have no interest in marrying and having family with an outsider unless that outsider is someone who converted.|`|AA11142865	What a horrible thing to say! Of course it is not true!  I live near Amish and know Amish.

q8Tkh1zdaa	Is it fair if an employer checks your MySpace or Facebook page, before they hire you?  no... because then I definitely would not get hired, because all's it is about is lots of perversion.... not unless I was trying out to be a stripper could they check out my myspace page<br>  <br>  What do you wish that you cooked better? everything because I burn boiling water<br>  <br>  Whom was your first celebrity crush? haha Jonathan Taylor Thomas<br>  <br>  Have you ever shoplifted?  yeah I totally steal everything, from toilet seats to turkey basters<br>  <br>  Which female celeb do you think is ugly but everyone thinks is HOTT ?<br>  Jessica Alba|`|I1K6SC43aa	Is it fair if an employer checks your MySpace or Facebook page, before they hire you?<br>  <br>  I am on the fence about that. There's a clear distinction between your personal and work life. People should still have a right to privacy. Now if there are serious problems with an employee, checking them out might not be a bad idea.<br>  <br>  What do you wish that you cooked better?<br>  <br>  Everything.<br>  <br>  Whom was your first celebrity crush?<br>  <br>  From what I remember, Pierce Brosnan.<br>  <br>  Have you ever shoplifted?<br>  <br>  No.<br>  <br>  Which female celeb do you think is ugly but everyone thinks is HOTT ?<br>  <br>  Hayden Panettiere.

a31kUn1Naa	My bf doesn't do that. He's not a douche.|`|1b99e2172d8e187dc1c01f1f61578326aa	Well, maybe they dont think it hurts you?  And why should it? Maybe you should be more secure that he wants to be with you and not with that woman - he *is* with you after all!<br>  <br>  And I bet you comment on hot guys - even if he doesn't get to  hear it, is it any different?|`|8kDAgDAzaa	Men inherently assess a woman's beauty.  It may not be politically correct to do so in today's society, but it is a built-in instinct that has been there for thousands of years.  Perhaps a few more decades of liberal control will squash another perfectly natural human instinct.<br>  <br>  --RFM|`|uEIOgxWlaa	I wouldn't do that. I'm single right now, and I been telling women how beautiful they are because it's true. However if I had a girlfriend I would not and I'll repeat, I would NOT flirt with women. It isn't right and you need to be dedicated to your girlfriend.|`|F63yZgkRaa	maybe to make you jealous and to see your reaction,i bet he wouldnt like it if you commented about a man! beat him at his own game or say yeah well i bet she wouldnt put up with the way you......pick your nose..........or something like that lol or say looking at her shes probaly used to "big" men but be careful as he may  not let you forget that one.|`|59xQlCjGaa	That's because they want to impress the other girl (stupid boyfriend) and thinks that if you break up with him, he'll still have the other "prettier" person.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, he's a jerk. Don't date anybody who does that, because, once again, HE'S A JERK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|AjBpAPpdaa	That's selfish, some of them actually don;t realise it hurts you|`|dccb42df3c8daddfd79c083be2ac5972aa	He'd do it once if he was my boyfriend, then I'd start telling him how smoking hot his best friend is...if that doesn't shut him up nothing will.|`|u5y8kE81aa	say it TO you're gf (;|`|a64l1dXLaa	Boys are piggies!

I agree or disagree with him usually|`|d5COR2S2aa	wow... they aren't guys. they're JERKS>|`|CzUTBx1Aaa	i dont do it|`|SZ7jLJG8aa	My boyfriend does that, well not so much anymore since I talked to him about it. i think they do it because they forget that just because we are their girlfriend, we do still have feelings.<br>  <br>  Just sit down and talk to him. Tell him that you don't like it and it makes you feel bad when he comments ont he looks of another girl when you are with him.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, you can always hit him on the back of the head when you catch him staring at other girls. Good Luck girl.|`|zDhTTGlxaa	You should not let this upset you...I know it is hard and can be percieved as quite insensitive of anyone to do this...but think for one second. If someone is beautiful in their eyes or yours..this remains a fact, why hide it? a man and a woman in a confident and loving relationship can talk freely about who they think looks good or not....without fear of running off with them.<br>  You should do the same and see how your boyfriend reacts. If he is ok with it then he is confident in your relationship and you. if he gets upset he quite simply isn't and you both need to look at your relationship|`|7sA8HwTzaa	I think it's a compliment to the gf that says that the man is secure in his gf's feelings for him that she knows he'd not leave her.  If it's a problem, turn the tables on him.  Or if you think he's just mean, try to beat him to the punch and point out a beauty before he has the chance.  It'll confuse the he11 out of him.|`|4E07Ejkiaa	It is just a natural response. They are only human. I don't believe they do it to make us feel bad. They just don't think about how it will affect us. You should be secure enough with yourself and in your relationship to know that he doesn't mean anything by it. You should try commenting along with him sometime. He will be impressed with your confidence to acknowledge another woman's beauty.|`|f1c1c8dafe8cc85d8807ccbdff4a484baa	I guess I've commented on others looks, good or bad, in front of my girlfriend, and she's done the same in front of me with guys.  We are  comfortable and trust each other enough to not let a complimentary remark about someone else bother us.|`|gVOeroPeaa	we do that? well, im sure its not consciously....at least..not me<br>  <br>  why do chicks talk ON AND ON about other guys? i know this one girl, and sometimes i just want her to stfu about guys shes meeting XD<br>  <br>  ha, i is a genus.i answr yur qustin wit nuther questin XD|`|1W7Endxtaa	only assholes do that. haha..well...wait...there's a difference between checking them out and admiring beauty. my bf will say that someone is beautiful or hot (guy or girl..he thinks brad pitt and zac effron are hot too) but he doesn't talk about them or anything besides saying they look good, then he's off the topic. which i don't mind at all ^_^|`|kNLi16C6aa	I dunno hey.<br>  <br>  My hubby only just started doing it recently...I guess he knows that I know he loves me, and that I trust him. Its just innocent chest bashing really, make themselves appear more sexual.<br>  <br>  But It would be nice if I aroused that kind of a response every now and again.|`|jUaSbfhJaa	Well I don't see why you should get upset.<br>  If they say something like "She is the most beautifulest woman i have ever seen", then yeah they're dickheads<br>  But if it's like "she's hot", then learn to control your feelings.|`|35770bf8f2d8c67783b3ab4e50bf146caa	They only do it if they are jerks, or if their girlfriend does the same thing. Do you say stuff about how hot (insert celeb here) is? Maybe that makes him feel like he can do the same to you?|`|L5cReesbaa	Because guys are pigs, and are goverened solely by their hormones.|`|RFTvAfILaa	Because they didn't think you'd be so sensitive.<br>  <br>  Accept that they think other people are good looking, just like you do.<br>  It doesn't mean he doesn't love you, y'know.|`|ZgJPtP1Raa	bc girrl ..guys are *****|`|ktsPCsBjaa	i agree with all of the above<br>  <br>  especially the one about having a belly button!!!|`|CVk2dWiDaa	becuase guys are stupid idiotic retards who have no respect. All they think about is "getting some love"|`|7i9zha6Oaa	something guys do while hanging out with guys should do it hanging wit your girl messed up|`|wDC1JUw3aa	yes|`|DrFRgtG3aa	because guys will be guys and no matter what, we say what we think.|`|vJGeOvQxaa	NOT ALL GUYS DO THAT...<br>  <br>  IF A GUY TRULY LOVES A GIRL, HE CAN'T SEE ANYTHING <br>  <br>  EXCEPT THEIR GIRLFRIEND|`|JlyYRBCIaa	if your boyfriend is doing that, you should drop him, or drop kick him. <br>  <br>  thats essentially emotional abuse|`|YY3ZLpiWaa	i think they like that girl thats why i never listen to them|`|D8sN8gNFaa	It's called being nice, and giving credit when credit is due.|`|EOaFZoNtaa	Robin Williams once said.<br>  Man have a brain and a penis and only enough blood to work one and one time.|`|dfRu4G1gaa	ok I'm confused?<br>  In front of what?<br>  and why should you be hurt in any way if someone compliments you or your girlfriend?|`|cBtFp2aYaa	a can tell you thats not true. i never even check out any other girls only my gf thats what you do when inlove|`|LBbKmemxaa	Good guys wouldn't do that.|`|rugfqD4Aaa	why do GIRLS state random things about GUYS as if they're true?|`|aDnIhNNnaa	i dint no people do that|`|xSOAwIXsaa	Because many of them have an IQ of 4<br>  Not all... many|`|JU26EGAeaa	I can't help it|`|CqeyeIJ8aa	my bf dosent do that either..<br>  <br>  but usually cuase the other girl cethces there attention..?? idk im not a guy (:|`|Diucgiriaa	cause their shizz heads...stand up for urself girl!! <br>  Screw that gay azz byotch|`|OfUeh7AOaa	and you have never turned your eyes on a guys butt or pack. you can answer this question to answer yours.does your bf come home to you and you only every night? if he does it to just piss you off then dump him. but if it is done out of fantasy vs spite then talk to him.some say they dont look that is a lie.<br>  single married it doesnt matter both men and women look fact of life!|`|SceQNNDbaa	Because SOME guys have no respect and they don't have appreciation for what they have. They could care less about hurting someone and they believe they can do what ever they want because there the MAN.<br>  <br>  inconsiderate assholes.|`|0YzkSIW4aa	A guy does that because he feels comfortable enough with you, and his feelings for you, to give a compliment to another woman. If he's hiding it, then you need to worry.|`|OAIjRoTdaa	my bf use to do that. until i broke down x____x <br>  he does that every 5 seconds (well use to :D)<br>  Just tell him you feel really bad inside...<br>  i hope he understands o.o|`|yB3Jek85aa	i dont know i never did that before but tell him that not us only you can get the real answer if you askl him|`|C8DOT8Y7aa	Trey have a belly button Ring|`|xESvfzQAaa	Because most guys assume that the BUFF knows her place and shouldn't expect any comments being slung her way.|`|Is3pmbbKaa	Guys are like that...but not my guy ;) <br>  Learn to choose wisely.|`|kJ7mcPLbaa	My boyfriend never does that. He's a real man.|`|0V2RsODOaa	My  ex b/f didnt do that... I actually never even saw him look at another girl while he was with me...|`|9EkFrApiaa	Yeah, I don't accept that.  Early on in every relationship I have been like "oh hell no!  You didn't!"  And it works because men love confidence in women-- they do it partly to see how you will react.<br>  <br>  My bf right now is AWESOME and tried that once very early on, and he was in the dog house...now he doesn't even think about it.  It's awesome because we can go to Hooters or where ever and I never worry about it because it is sans sex if he does.|`|FsozOO6Zaa	Because they have no respect for their woman. They need to learn how to control themselves. If they think that woman is beautiful, by all means, go after her! You don't need your girlfriend to stop you...they're all assholes.|`|CNSGz12zaa	Why would it hurt you?

BeSZ4nXraa	Pianos don't break now because they have an iron frame instead of a wooden one :)  It's not the size, it's the material.  Stretching the strings so tight put tension that a wooden-framed piano sometimes couldn't handle. I have heard rumours that Liszt would have to have a few pianos in the wings because he would break a few in any given performance.  Tee hee|`|aSTmFCiBaa	bs musical conceptions were ahead of his time,and beyond the capacities of the instruments and players of the day|`|10mOHSZTaa	Beethoven had dinky little fortepianos, and he slammed on them really freaking hard. He wasn't breaking Steinways.<br>  <br>  The forte dynamic exists because you lose a lot of emotional range if you can't play loud.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I have to disagree with Kimi. Playing soft doesn't mean it's relaxing. The beginning of the Erlkonig starts soft but is two guys in a carriage pulled by galloping horses, and someone dies by the end of the piece. You can have soft tension and loud but relatively chilled out stuff.|`|pNeakgzlaa	Forte isn't banging on the piano, Forte is the energy of the piece, while piano is the relaxation parts.  Just think of it that way and don't break your piano.|`|KZVntwvHaa	Pianos have developed a lot since the 1800s; they are most likely stronger now. Also remember that Beethoven was deaf in his later years, so he may have been playing them unmusically loud.|`|3ZgtJK9raa	I believe making music with your own two hands is worth braking a piano<br>  <br>  But thats just me

TLNQZ63baa	Number one. She has that Boho chic look to her.  Even though she looks like she's on a heroine trip all flying high all Janice Joplin,  she looks insightful, thoughtful, intelligent.  <br>  <br>  Girl two reminds me of Ashley Simpson.  The type that speaks her mind (too often), knows she's haute and talks a lot.  Probably gets into a lot of fights.<br>  <br>  I'd go for number one.  She looks more like one of the guys but in a femine sexy way.|`|wZloBlGlaa	neither, because i'm a girl|`|ENspyhzUaa	eww...i want something that costs more than $2.99|`|P8uh4joQaa	I'd rather date someone who I can have intelligent conversations with.|`|CArzkDIUaa	2 no homo|`|4SGBr8cWaa	how about a threesome, both cute|`|84125c1fc4eb19c99547898a6cfbc367aa	the one I'd rather go on a date is girl 2. Spunky and talkative. She must have something to say. Makes a date less boring, Maybe 'tween breaths, I can get a word or two in as well. I like the fact that she looks like she's wearing some makeup on, as well. Would rather go out with a girl that takes good care of herself. You know, has a good self image. Not that girl 1 doesn't. by the picture she has on the web girl #1 looks boring, and not as interesting as the other one I selected. <br>  Good luck.|`|l0HlqDDMaa	I prefer shy, intelligent and witty.

And I pray that you, being rooted and established in love, 18may have power, together with all the saints, to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ, 19and to know this love that surpasses knowledge—that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God. <br>   20Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us, 21to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever!

3YLTBfzzaa	Yeah it's rude, but I've been attacked by Christians as well. I'm a live and let live person myself and let people believe what they want. But some want to shove their opinions down your throat. You can live by your own beliefs, but I'm not going to because I have my own.|`|tDU347knaa	Yes.|`|YW1DXceqaa	Im Jewish so ehh i don't care|`|AA12024798	I dunno.  It does bother me when someone who I would generally be more inclined to agree with makes a complete a** of themself just to prove a point - it only makes the people they're arguing with have less respect for them and, by extension, people with similar beliefs. <br>  <br>  I have to say though, you sound a tad bit immature yourself.  No offense, but if you're going to go off on people for being immature, shouldn't you at least limit the name calling? Sorry, just a thought...|`|VA3tGarQaa	Yeah, I'm an Atheist. But that doesn't mean I set out to get into arguments with the Christians. I really don't care, they can believe what they want. If they don't ram their views down my throat, neither will I. But fortunately most of the ones I've meet seem nice.|`|AA12382198	I'm a long-time Atheist.<br>  <br>  I have never questioned a Believers beliefs.....or tried to get them on "my-side".<br>  <br>  This is a free Country and we should believe in what we want as long as it doesn't infringe on another persons rights.|`|S2tBYhCKaa	Immaturity is part of growing up.<br>  Waiting for the wise to pop out of mama's isn't going to happen.|`|9BFEiPsRaa	Yes, I do.<br>  I'm a Christian, but I'm not going to try to force my religion on you, or anybody else.  So, why should some atheists try to force me to believe there is no God?  Its quite annoying.|`|v2Fj6883aa	It annoys me when they go out of their way to talk down christians.. It's almost like they're insecure about their religion.|`|V29AonY7aa	Yes it is annoying|`|qwInrvUGaa	yes|`|cAauS5aqaa	Yeah, those people piss me right the f*ck off. I mean, I believe in God and I was never a really religious person, but I run into thosr kinds of people with their heads so far up their azzes they die of starvation. I mean, yeah, I question my beliefs every once in a while, but i still believe in somthing. It seems to me those people just havr nothing better to do than spit and $hit on someone else's beliefs because oh yeah, "there's no God because I haven't seen one" or, "if hr's so real, then why dosen't he come and save me?". Sh*t like that gets right under my skin. You don't see me going around this b*tch talking about: "Yeah, God's gonna come and strike you down because you have reached the brim of your aniquities!" No. You don't see me doing that. It's pointless. But then again, religion can stir the most atavistic and visceral arguements ever, so that is why I think "religion" is a contradictory practice no matter what the type. Maybe except buddism. I think I'll even try it one day. But yeah Alex, no disrespect go you and your beliefs, but there are a lot of a$shole atheists out there (what's funny is since they believe in they'll die and come back as trees, they'll come back as huge oaks and people will cut them down and print the Bible all over them)

4xUm9xTLaa	Her fiancé.  It is sad when fame go over her head.  She looks like nice girl but when it comes to money and fame, love takes second seat.<br>  Worst is that she wait it until last minute before dumping him. She used him to get her career moving and waited until her movie got successful.  She was with him because she was not sure her career will take off. I think her intention was if her career takes off, she will dump his ***. If her career stalls, she will marry him so he could support her.  Hey but who care, show business is cut throat business, you do whatever you need to move up, even that means hurting and using people who love you.<br>  India is big on believing karma, I hope karma find her.
g5pZhzeoaa	Think about it, can anyone really give you a definite definition of what punk music is?  Everyone has their own opinions and isn't that stressed in the 'punk communities'?  So of course everyone will voice their opinion and not everyone will agree.  Punk rock is just so.....general.  The sound, honestly, I don't think has much to do with it.  And as for what they stand for: It's true, music is not talking about the same things it was in the past.  I think that it is because the world has changed, so isn't that reason enough for punk rock to change too as long as the musicians are OK with it?  From my understanding, punk rock is about telling people what you think, even if a lot of people don't agree with the opinion said. Now you see, no matter what you say in one way or another deep down it is punk, as long as it is for yourself......In my opinion of course. :-p|`|zFwjZy53aa	because it used to be more of a lifestyle then it became fashion. And most of the old punk bands that are still around have sold out, like GBH, Misfits, Casualties, etc. Now everystore from K-mart to Macy's sells the "punk" style.

L2AQypipaa	Mandy was never a favourite. She actually was only in S1 and then disappeared with no explanation. I just think her character wasn't a good fit with the others. Plus Mandy was supposed to be a love interest for Josh but the actors had zero chemistry!<br>  <br>  Amy always grated. In my opinion she was opportunistic and manipulative and once she'd shown Josh he couldn't trust her, their relationship was doomed!|`|58868fd705c451ae6ba08dde25bd9c7caa	I'm just about finishing up Season 5.

She drives me bananas. <br>  <br>  I also don't understand who thought Will would be a good replacement for Sam. He's very underused in Season 5 and he's just a foil for Toby without the humor and background and idealism of Sam.<br>  <br>  I have to agree that Seasons 1-4 were awesome.

KpO4UtElaa	my hours and days both pass quickly.
FYNXch4faa	Yeah, most schools here in england do (i dont know of one that doesnt have them) and i do think it helps poorer students being bullied and just little things like that. Whenever we had mufti days people would always be SO much more judgemental of others. But it should not be too strict|`|5uzHW4CYaa	I guess I can go both ways on this one, just because I see an argument for both.<br>  With uniforms, there would be less anxiety about style, what someone is wearing, "expressing yourself" and things like that. More focus on who someone is and less on what their style is.<br>  <br>  I also see why they wouldn't be so good.. kids would complain about not being able to express their individuality, having to look like clones, and being bored silly with what they have to wear.<br>  <br>  If I had to choose, I'd choose no uniforms. It would be so boring and less exuberant with them!|`|AA12024798	No way!  I would HATE that!  Especially for high school...I mean, come on, being a teenager is a time to experiment with different things and express yourself in different ways, and one of those ways is most definitely though how you dress.  I think uniforms are stupid.  They just take away from our individuality.  That's why I like my school - you can basically wear anything as long as it doesn't offend anyone.<br>  <br>  I guess I can sort of understand the argument about less pressure to "dress cool", but it never occurs to me because my school is so weird we're pretty much completely removed from that.  EDIT: I agree with the people who said that they would just find something else to pick on.  It's just how some people act - if they're going to make fun of the "uncool" kids, they're going to make fun of them, uniforms or not.|`|YvuCN6qWaa	I actually do think that they should because it definitely helps the learning process in schools, plus people couldn't make fun of others anymore for what they're wearing since everyone's wearing the same thing. But I do think that there should be one day where you can wear normal clothes - like Fridays.|`|AA11388636	No!!! Students shouldn't have to wear uniforms. I had to wear them in 7th and 8th grade. I hated it. In my opinion students can't express themselves through the clothes they wear and it doesn't help students with paying attention in class or not get beaten up.|`|r5h7TmWJaa	Yes. So many people wear so many nasty things, and get beat up because they dress a different way. Would make things easier. But shoes and such should be optional.|`|AA12150589	Maybe in school but not in the office!|`|QPo0CQ3Yaa	I haven't firmly formed a decision on this one yet.  In my day, didn't have to wear a uniform to the schools I went to.  Based on my own children though I would tend to lean toward street clothes.  <br>  <br>  There is both the good and the bad though from a parental view.  I would spend less on clothes if they are in uniforms.  The bad is the uniform could be a short revealing skirt I do not approve of, although they are weaning that out of the uniforms at the local school near us.<br>  <br>  When alls said I still am undecided leaning towards no uniform because I never had to wear one and really liked the individuality.  I still remember my first tight pair of jeans and cowboy boots, and the reaction when I wore them....you know what maybe uniforms aren't so bad for my kids...... ;-)<br>  <br>  Edit: count me as no to uniforms for your paper.|`|zGFiWSPtaa	No, I don't think there should be uniforms. Students should be allowed to wear what they want and express themselves through their clothes. There should be a dress code, but not a uniform. People may argue that kids get picked on over their clothes, but you know the truth is that if it wasn't the clothes, the "cool" kids would just find something else to be mean about. Clothes allow people to make a statement and show who they are. Uniforms don't allow for that. Uniforms are ridiculous.|`|jwiko3qQaa	Absolutely not. It's called public school for a reason. Not to mention, it would be very hard to enforce on students, ESPECIALLY in high schools. I know a lot of people at my school wear religious clothing (i.e. Jesus t-shirts), making them wear uniforms is taking away their right to express their religion. Also, students wear clothes expressing their thoughts and feelings about things. Such as who should be president, favorite bands, quotes from tv, music, and movies, etc. Uniforms also take away our right to say what we want. Teenagers also express who they are through clothes. You can't take away what they use to express themselves, as everyone encourages them to do so. And everything about "students won't be picked on a bullied if there wear uniforms" is wrong. They will find something about people to pick at. It will never stop. <br>  <br>  I wrote a persuasive essay on school uniforms, but never used it because everyone favored my abortion paper.<br>  But good luck on your paper!|`|Xvq1cFZKaa	of course not!|`|ECMtjGf5aa	Sure, I dress pretty poorly yet im not poor.

It's also my favorite anime/manga ever. I've watched some of the anime you mentioned, but I would prefer One Piece anytime. It is never dragging and it's long to keep you busy. The Plot is so amazing and so are the characters and adventures they go on. It's very unpredictable and awesome. It's sooo funny too.<br>  <br>  It starts out okay at first but the more you watch, the better and more amazing it gets too. People are hooked into it and love it at different times. Some love it the first few episodes they watch, some take a few dozen and realize how amazing it is. It's an epic anime, a history in the making in my opinion.<br>  <br>  You can watch every episode here if you decide to watch it:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://watch-onepiece.com/" rel="nofollow">http://watch-onepiece.com/</a><br>  <br>  DO NOT watch the dub!!! It is horrible, it's bull****. The sub is 10000000000000x better than the dub in every possible way possible!!!|`|i210xqkgaa	hehe...oh,  if i had a nickel... here are my faves:<br>  Code Geass: Lelouch Of The Rebellion/R2 (my favorite)<br>  Shamen King<br>  Inuyasha<br>  YuYu Hakisho<br>  Devil May Cry: The Animated Series<br>  Fuli Culi<br>  Gundam Seed<br>  DragonBallZ<br>  Zatch Bell<br>  Bakugan<br>  Sonic X (2nd and 3rd season were good)<br>  Digimon (season 1-4 were good)<br>  Pokemon (seasons 1-4 were good)<br>  Yu-Gi-Oh (season 1 was good)|`|AA11852077	Kaleido Star(shoujo)<br>  Kiba(shounen)<br>  Skip Beat(shoujo)<br>  Eyeshield 21(shounen)

He owes his existance to Harry Potter.|`|VA3tGarQaa	To be honest with you, I haven't a clue who you're talking about.|`|lnRMmSeyaa	robert pattinson?<br>  <br>  omg yes!!!!!|`|LOat20Hmaa	EW! no not the sane ones. just the tween ones|`|2WiKH3Hkaa	It's sad when they think dead guys are hot.|`|4dwzZyvsaa	I LOVE HIM!!!|`|aBH8rWP2aa	No!|`|alG24hJ5aa	i dont but my friends do.|`|KVKGesM9aa	noo he not that hot.!!!! i seen better|`|oFjQAWA5aa	Nope i sure don't!!!|`|57845b8374924287d473183b90b2a4eaaa	he looks like a hobo in real life!|`|DoaMYpfMaa	he is so ugly|`|U4Mu7WQ2aa	yes|`|soNHKzK2aa	quite a few do. i think he is :)|`|BfPisjj0aa	i think he was hot in the movie<br>  on the red carpet <br>  not so much<br>  he says he doesn't comb his hair and he doesn't shave<br>  that's a little disgusting<br>  i know he cut his hair but i think he looked better with his long hair the way he had it in the movie|`|HWijr6uxaa	which guy? <br>  <br>  robert (edward)- yes hes cute :) <br>  jackson (jasper)- hes my favorite, hes so hot!<br>  kellan (emmett)-  hes cute too. <br>  <br>  <br>  if you mean robert, then yes i do think he is hot. I knew right away he was cedric from harry potter 4 because im also a harry potter fan. I thought he was cute in Harry potter too. :)|`|rjsfiWt9aa	Well, when reading the books they discribe Edward kind of like the perfect man who is romantic and sweet and protective. I think many girls just think Robert Pattinson (the man who plays edward) if hot because they link him to Edward.|`|y1FqSk0haa	you know, when he was in Harry Potter, no one payed attention to him. now when he is in Twilight everyone suddently pays attention to him! ummmm WTF MUCH. and yes, I do think he is hot|`|0eoVWw6kaa	well, i am a girl and i don't think so. i don't think they like him just the idea that he plays the heart throb from the book.|`|Px1Jjk1Xaa	it's really just the idea of a vampire that's hot.  i dont know, i thought the hair was too crazy to be hot in the movies|`|J5onMZPiaa	Bro bro bro. I could have one eye and a penis on my chin. But put me in a sexy and slightly dangerous love movie.

And he is suppose to look like a "pale skinned zombie" the movie is about him being a vampire and he can't go out in the sun so duh.|`|j0zDvJycaa	I dont think girls accually think that Robert Pattison is hot, but that the character he plays is attractive. The vampire character has a dangerous and mysterious quality that girls like.|`|Q5qpMLOVaa	I do.|`|0WKkXIyKaa	he is weird looking.|`|9LzlIgoJaa	The girls at my school won't shut up about him.|`|fIEmi84Laa	I find the girl hotter than him.|`|dDDAbqqhaa	apparently<br>  <br>  his face looks like a slapped butt|`|t6WAuz9Taa	nOO!!!
2xUNIc73aa	Can't be bothered to watch.  They don't seem to pick the best performances anyway, they are too sentimental (dead actor or comeback actor) or else too political.  If it has to do with gays or gayness it is not automatically wonderful.<br>  <br>  Look back on pictures that have received awards in past years.  You will roll on the floor laughing in disbelief.|`|g7gvzhkpaa	I'm waiting for it to come on now ,I want to see the outfits ,Hugh Jackman hosting ,do want to see who wins best actor /actress and best picture ...yeah I do .|`|uxuExQ2Taa	Cuz if you've seen the movie then you start to care more about the art and what it took to make the movie. Therefore you care about the actors and directors attached to your favorite movies.|`|KuvTfJB3aa	Sometimes. I am tonight for three reasons.<br>  <br>  1. I want some noise to be in the room.<br>  2. There's nothing else on I want to watch.<br>  3. Leonardo DiCaprio will be there.<br>  <br>  -EDIT- I have a fourth reason.<br>  <br>  4. I don't want to watch my DVR recording of various rerun SpongeBob episodes.|`|CBKjEvp5aa	Nope. I can find better ways to waste my time, such as answering questions on Y!A. So much more fulfilling, and I'm not being sarcastic.|`|XhzFcN7Kaa	I don't and won't watch them on TV but I will watch parts of it on youtube.|`|Y8Suz0l3aa	Because it is a chance to see Johnny Depp, that's why.|`|0b8830a9996850776676a58c9915fb1eaa	Yes, i'm watching it right now, to c who is the "stars" of the year.

When he tries to get it, yank it away! You can also try this: get your hand wet. I mean, really, really wet. When you're behind him, fake a sneeze and fling the water at him at the same time. The water will be a nice effect.|`|I1lzNl6Laa	put cling film across the toilet, when he uses the toilet he wont notice and will urinate all over the place....

wA8Dyhq7aa	No way to change your mind, because you're absolutely correct:  she **IS NOT** country.  Listen to her next to Loretta Lynn or Kitty Wells, or even someone like Barbara Mandrell, and you'll see that she is most definitely not doing the same type of music.|`|AA12103453	She's pop, and I think she is bubblegum pop(teenager pop).|`|7adb1ec924a232bd76f142d1a8a85b1baa	She's not country, she's pop.|`|JYVuP6C5aa	Alright, so country music has changed, A LOT in the past.. year even.  it's taken a lot of twists and turns. but i think that it's such a wide genre of music, i sort of play country music, i'm just starting out, but i'd love for someone to ask what genre of music i play, and when i say "country" have them ask "oh, what kind"  because honestly.. there's loads of different kinds. <br>  <br>  Taylor Swift, she's more on the pop side of things. She's a country/pop artist, leaning more and more to the pop side as the days go by.|`|CoCn3GbOaa	Country? She is as country as a subway. Like most of the folks who produce "Country" music it is all pop and rock with not much of a soul to it like the old REAL country musicians.|`|1UKAho1iaa	She's a pop singer. I don't know why she is considered country.|`|sqeWNMbuaa	For once, and only this one time, am I agreeing with a person who has a user name that has to do with Miley Cyrus. Only once shall I say this. You will never find me doing this again.<br>  <br>  She is a pop-country singer who appeals to teenagers. Taylor Swift's music (if you listen to the lyrics and actually look into the meaning) are alot to do with boys, bad relationships, good relationships, and backstabbing people (friends, boyfriends). It's not very universal and her audience is not as wide as other singers (take for example the female country singer of the year at this year's Grammys - Carrie Underwood).|`|PPoCaJEEaa	I don't think she is. Honestly, she kind of annoys me. All her songs are really I don't know.. childish. Every single ones about a new boy, at her concerts she goes on and on about which boy it was about and it gets old quick.|`|ymK1hg2Raa	have you ever noticed that all of her songs are about a guy? no joke, every single one!!!<br>  <br>  i think she sounds like more of a pop singer, to be honest!|`|2Hl4AAP7aa	not even  going to try to change your mind as a long time fan of classic country music i can honestly say,"Taylor Swift is NOT country"|`|WaYZQhnHaa	Just because her first single was titled "Tim McGraw", that doesn't make her a country artist.  I think her songs are more pop than country.|`|LxqASvECaa	shes country -pop , so yes i think shes real country. i love her|`|4dCSrU5Paa	shes not country she is more pop/rock or teen pop|`|MJzySru4aa	yep  ya  right  her songs don't sound like country  they   trying to change country  music|`|LQfYmIWeaa	Country music is not like it used to be. there is a lot of country music that def. sounds like rock or pop. but they also have a country sound. yes i consider taylor swift country, but i also consider her pop, and a little bit of rock. if an artist is considered to be a certain genre but makes a song that is a diffrent gere, usually it will still be categorized as the genre that the artist is considered. im not saying thats how it should be though.|`|ffab01a92e978af828e5f1703775e5ddaa	Country music is just like any other genre... it's evolving. For instance, remember when Buddy Holly was considered rock and roll? What does Coldplay have in common with his music?<br>  <br>  Genre names are all muddled anymore, and they produce whatever they think people will buy, period. Some artists make music for themselves, and an audience finds them, others aim for an audience. Taylor peddled her songs in Nashville, and they stuck. So, she gets called "country."<br>  <br>  Doesn't hurt anybody.|`|QwCsFKLQaa	its sad her first couple songs were country, and i think she was country, and i think that producers and the madia have forced her music to cross over quickly to make more money. <br>  <br>   and its very sad, cause if she really did right all that stuff, she s great, but the label putting pop music in the back makes it NOT country at all, and i know 1 of her last couple songs wasnt country as far as the lyrics go as well,  so there slowly making her change what she is.    poor thing..   she coulda been the next patsy cline if the people in charge didnt screw it up. <br>  <br>   ""the man"" controls whats going on and if american teens start to worship someone, they have to control what that person does the most manipulative way they can, the gov wants america to dumbed down as quickly as possible, and they dont have very far to go. <br>  <br>  <br>   prime example ... kenny chesney,  sadly hes no longer country in least.   $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$|`|KReWaGFsaa	Her music isn't purely country. It's a good mix of pop and country. <br>  The songs on her newer album are less country-ish than the songs on her older album.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't consider her 100% country.. country-pop suits more.|`|pNeakgzlaa	She says that she's a pop country singer so it's not supposed to be totally country.|`|CjPNZo3saa	meh, i'd say she's in between, kinda like a pop age country singer. i like her stuff though.
mjUAom75aa	if Rhianna values her life she will keep a good distance away from that maniac.once a women beater always a women beater.|`|oeeT4Zlqaa	The girl above me is crazy,you're not supposed to wait around for it to happen again, that's the problem with women today they always go back to the man that beat them because they ''love'' him. But love isn't giving you a bruise on each side of your head, biting you, busting your lip and then leaving you, it's just not. If she gets back with him I hope Letterman or Oprah lets her have it once she appears on their shows. <br>  <br>  I just watched a video over on comcast news and apparently he sent her flowers, an Ipod Touch, and a diamond bracelet and they've been talking on the phone. She needs to get some self-respect, be a woman and leave. If she doesn't she will forever be looked at as an idiot not only by the public but by other celebrities who have said she should leave him.|`|QV02KUDRaa	I think it is retarded and pretty idiotic if they do...Like Bobby Brown and Whitney *shudders* prime example of a stupid couple|`|B30RnSqUaa	i think this isnt a good look for rihanna..nobody is going to have any respect for a woman that decides to get back with her boyfriend that was accused of beating her..<br>  <br>  another thing..it makes her accusations less believble because if all these horrific things she said really happened, getting back with him would be the last thing she would think about...<br>  <br>  this makes everyone think twice whether everything she said was right...|`|032467f7118afdbd53ad18573df6ce42aa	yes they will get back together she loves him and he loves her and she never called the cops someone else did so that means they are also fighting who cares they are both young so they have alot to learn about life|`|e8lAALzgaa	No they should not get back together. And believe me her family and her handlers (Jay-Z etc.) will not let her get back with him. They know how bad it'll look if Rihanna gets back with him after what he did to her.|`|VrwKnmc0aa	I think that is a little crazy for them to get back together don't you think? I mean they can forgive each other move on just to be friends but not boyfriend and girlfriend again. First of all never lay your hands on a woman physically harming her. I think it was wrong for whatever reason. Even if Rihanna did something first he did not have to go that far! I like both of them as artist but maybe they just weren't meant for each other.|`|0Xi82AU3aa	I personally think it would be pretty stupid of Rihanna to get back with him.<br>  <br>  Once a guy lays a hand on a woman....it's unforgivable. Of course, others think otherwise.<br>  <br>  But my answer is Definitely NO, she shouldn't even try.|`|do8pdlluaa	I don't think they should get together but now Rihanna is pregnant with brown's child!<br>  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/bm6ozb" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/bm6ozb</a>|`|LomltbCjaa	If Rihanna goes back to that, then it would be proven that she possesses absolutely no self respect.|`|92fNY4Fvaa	i think that once he has had A LOT of help, they should get back together,  especially since she loves him. but if it happens again, they should break up and not be together again|`|G68ifXX8aa	dey should not get back together is she crazy<br>  he gonna doit again <br>  is she loca|`|LGmLjn5xaa	I think that is a horrible idea!!!!!!

TW1TJWTfaa	In their time, they were big because they were inventive. They went around doing things that no other band had ever done, or dreamed of doing. They incorporated many different techniques, instruments, and cultural/philosophical influences into their songs, and made them open for the world to enjoy. They were also very intelligent people, and talented musicians, and that shined through in their work. <br>  <br>  Nowadays, they remain popular because of the great quality of their work, and because of the fact that no other band has ever been able to do what they did again. <br>  The sad thing is, their best-known songs are also mostly the ones that show these characteristics the least. <br>  <br>  <br>  (End of the wall of text)<br>  <br>  <br>  Listen to:<br>  <br>  Strawberry Fields Forever     -     (some of my favorite lyrics. I prefer the Anthology version)<br>  You Never Give Me Your Money    -    (the style changes a lot throughout the song)<br>  Ask Me Why   -    (early stuff)<br>  A Day In The Life    -     (trippy. great vocals)<br>  I Want You (She's So Heavy)    -   (great bass performance)<br>  If I Fell     -     (listen to the triple harmony in the singing voices)<br>  Love You To     -    (considered the first western song to seriously incorporate elements from eastern music)<br>  I Am The Walrus    -    (a classic)<br>  Happiness is a Warm Gun    -   (I just really like it)<br>  While My Guitar Gently Weeps   -    (another classic. very good.)<br>  Norweigian Wood    -     (Sounds like your average sad love song, but it's really about setting fire to an ex-lover's cheapo apartment)|`|XbRc9Hdaaa	They actually enjoyed to make music, it wasn't all for the money.<br>  Their songs had meanings<br>  They were talented at what they did|`|w6MtjrMVaa	Because of their talent in writing great songs, also in their style of the music that they preformed for many years. I believe their music will last for many generations to come for young and old.|`|tRxm7fq0aa	I personally like them because... they have a different sound than pretty much all that I have come across. They figured odd little things to add to their songs that you would never think would actually make them better. They talk a lot about love and it's importance. And I really like their singing voices.|`|H4Li4MAvaa	well, personally, i think they're great because of their talent & music. some of their songs are very unique, and their songs always make my day a good one.

Suddenly there is the opportunity for people to mass protest."<br>   <br>  Mr Hartshorn, who is regularly briefed on potential causes of civil unrest, singled out April's G20 summit of the leading developed nations being held in London, as one of the events that could kick start a series of protests.<br>   <br>  "We've got G20 coming and I think that is being advertised on some of the sites as the highlight of what they see as a 'summer of rage'," he said.<br>   <br>  The officer added that banks, particularly those that still pay large bonuses despite receiving billions of aid from the taxpayer, had also become "viable targets" for protesters.<br>  <br>  <br>  Other parts of Europe have already seen large-scale protests against the handling of the economy.<br>   <br>  Email Story <br>  Share Story <br>    <br>  Delicious <br>  Digg <br>  Facebook <br>  Stumbleupon <br>  Reddit <br>  Newsvine <br>  Print Story <br>  <br>  <br>   <br>  I'm Ian A, your 7 Waves Community roving reporter: you know me best as, "Mr Versatile" <br>  <br>   <br>  Handing you back to the studio now ...<br>   <br>  >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>...|`|Mu7rnIoMaa	Gormless!<br>  <br>  Useless!<br>  <br>  Sackable!<br>  <br>  Hopeless!<br>  <br>  Unelected!<br>  <br>  anti-referendum!<br>  <br>  Take your pick!|`|Cq1chP3Qaa	CENSORED!!!!|`|S2tBYhCKaa	Browner.|`|akM9EZ8Gaa	BROWN :P|`|JQjs3cB3aa	tosser<br>  <br>  ungifted :)|`|186deac21531919b3fa042717df297e7aa	d!ckhead x|`|e4478f08249c4cf9e1fe4f544b626018aa	be creative in one word?

eMpxLL5Haa	www.therandirhodesshow.com has this message:<br>  <br>  Nova M radio has not yet corrected the problem that has kept me off the air despite my strong desire and readiness to broadcast my show.  Respecting the employer-employee relationship that has existed between Nova M and me, and expecting the solution to be quickly achieved, details of the triggering event were withheld in good faith.  But I can tell you this much:  any statement implicating me as being in any way responsible for the disruption in The Randi Rhodes Show is patently false.  This entire situation is solely within the control of Nova M.<br>  <br>  In light of most recent developments, my show will be seeking a new home.  I would ask for your continued patience and indulgence in respecting my rights during this time.  Your unwavering support is cherished.  Thank you.<br>  <br>  Randi Rhodes<br>  <br>  <br>  Radioink.com quotes the Nova M website:<br>  <br>  PHOENIX -- February 16, 2009: Nova M host Randi Rhodes has been off the air for more than a week, and now Nova M co-owner Anita Drobny says on the company website, "I have not had the option to disclose what has been happening between Randi and Nova M."<br>  <br>  The statement continues, "I want you all to know that Nova M has done everything we can to get her back on the air. All this is her choice; if she wants to tell you all what the issue is, then I hope she does, but I can't according to her contract rules. but I can tell you this I have wanted her back on the air. She's an amazing talent and needs to be heard."<br>  <br>  Drobny thanks listeners for their support and concludes, "Randi now has to make her decision as to what she must do with her career." Nancy Skinner has been filling in for Rhodes on the air.<br>  <br>  <br>  And here's a little more from wikipedia.org:<br>  <br>  Mrs. Drobny has also said, "People are saying it's about money. It's not about money at all. I just could not fulfill one of her requirements." She did, however, note the financial impact of Rhodes' departure: "I looked at [our] site, and I see that because Randi Rhodes isn't on, there are so many people leaving the Founders Club [which involves a fee paid to Nova M]. And you can't operate without people's participation." ...<br>  <br>  (also from wikipedia)  According to an individual familiar with the issue, Nova M agreed to provide certain standard legal protection for the popular radio host, but Rhodes had to leave the air and Nova M following a discovery that Nova had not lived up to its contractual promise.|`|AA10356243	From what is being said in the media, Rhodes split due to creative differences with Nova M and is said to be headed for just the local market where she originated from so far but no word as of now.<br>  <a href="http://www.therandirhodesshow.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.therandirhodesshow.com/</a><br>  <br>  Nova M was filing for bankruptcy but have apparently been taken over and renamed "On second thought radio network"<br>  <a href="http://www.novamradio.com/live/" rel="nofollow">http://www.novamradio.com/live/</a>|`|b46935e51173f254db10092f55afe9b6aa	I remember when Randi Rhodes first started on a small station in West Palm Beach Fla  then hit it bigger at WIOD....she is great   and sexy too

tuATxHsVaa	You should be able to tell whether a professional musician such as myself or someone else is answering your question properly. There are many bassoons out there that don't quite cut the mustard. I hear good things about the Fox Renard bassoons. You'll be spending $4,000 to $5,000 dollars for one of these instruments.<br>  <br>  Most every professional teacher I have ever spoken to has lamented the price of a good student bassoon. A decent student model instrument is always going to cost you around $5,000 dollars. The Fox Model 240 is used by many high school and college students and costs in the $7,000 range.<br>  <br>  Are you just getting mad because someone else told you that a $2,000 bassoon is "cheap" ? They were right. I am a professional violinist, and people think that an $800 violin is a good investment - when it is actually an  el-cheapo violin. Good violins, just like bassoons, are in the $10,000 and above range.<br>  <br>  Make sure you read about the bassoon that you choose. Some have features like smaller key distances/sizes for smaller hands. You want to make sure it's the right bassoon for you. <br>  <br>  In fact, what with the price of a bassoon, you really have no excuse for not having a private teacher to ask this question of. A teacher should already have been helping you to rent an instrument, and then to choose one to buy. That's what a good teacher does.|`|jR8kyp0Taa	<a href="http://band-orchestra.musiciansfriend.com/woodwinds/double-reed-instruments/basoons" rel="nofollow">http://band-orchestra.musiciansfriend.co...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.musicalinstruments.com/products/pc/viewCategories.asp?idCategory=791" rel="nofollow">http://www.musicalinstruments.com/produc...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Bassoons are very expensive.<br>  <br>  You'll be lucky to find a new one under $2,000 and that's for a cheap one.<br>  <br>  Boy Wonder<br>  <br>  EDIT: Court - he wasn't ranting about my answer. Someone had answered "cheap", and left it at that, and so the asker reported the answer and had it deleted. I chimed in right after that happened. <br>  <br>  I agree, if you want a decent model, be prepared to pay 4-5 grand. You can find ones that are $2,000 but that would be like buying a $100 violin. You get what you pay for, and although $2,000 is a lot of money, it will still buy you a piece of crap bassoon.|`|v5kii54Jaa	The standard student bassoon is the Fox Renard 240, which will set you back around 6 grand. Nobels play almost exactly the same and will only cost you 3 grand simply because they're polypropelene and you're not paying extra for all that wood. If you intend to major in bassoon studies you mind as well pay the extra 3 grand and go with the Fox because most colleges prefer you to have a wooden bassoon. If not, I would go with the nobel. I have personally owned both and thought that the Nobel played smoother. Justin Miller is a trusted dealer of both brands. <br>  <br>  www.millermarketingco.com<br>  <br>  You might be able to find a used bassoon through one of your local music shops. Generally they're not in such great condition, and it would pose the risk of you having to take on someone else's problem. Have you already started playing? If you're taking lessons from a private instructor, I would contact them and see if they could set something up with a dealer so you could try out a few different models and see which you prefer yourself. <br>  <br>  hope it helped :)

AA10589243	Uggg!.<br>  <br>  First off , you cannot use ham radio equipment to broadcast music etc with OR without a ham radio license ,, so forget about that.<br>  <br>  Secondly , unless you have the appropriate low power FM license and approved equipment you too can not broadcast music on the FM broadcast band.<br>  <br>  An antenna and transmitter can cost $2000-$5000. (according to wikipedia)<br>  <br>  Even after you spend the big money for a proper transmitter, antenna and get the appropriate license , you have to obtain legal permission to play the music.<br>  This will involve royalty and contractual arrangements with the record companies.<br>  <br>  If you are paying out royalties for each track that you play , you have to be earning money to pay for that.<br>  <br>  That means advertisers.<br>  <br>  Advertisers means that you now have an income , which means it is a business.<br>  A business means that you have to be registered as a business and pay tax.<br>  <br>  <br>  Simply put , there is no cheap , easy to do way of having even a small radio station.<br>  <br>  Anything that may appear to be an easy and cheap way WILL get you prosecuted by the government , and then it becomes REAL nasty.|`|ZBFE9AqZaa	a 5 to 10 watt transmitter and anttena if you are far enough from a strong radio signal on the same frequency. and if you use a ham radio you'll need a license.<br>  <br>  either way good luck that nobody reports you for your pirate radio. your signal would be easy to triangulate where you are broadcasting from.<br>  <br>  unless your broadcasting in digital or have a digital to analog converter and the right software you will not be able to hook it up to your lap top.<br>  <br>  can't help you on the brands or prices.|`|Vhv1vyKWaa	Without applying for an FCC-licensed station, there is no legal way to do this.<br>  <br>  The penalty, when you are caught as a pirate, is $10k.<br>  <br>  The next-closest possibility is to form a non-profit organization and apply for a low power FM (LPFM) whenever the next filing window opens.<br>  <br>  There are some legal ways of operating a low power station, primarily under Part 15 rules.<br>  <br>  For more, check out <a href="http://www.part15.us" rel="nofollow">http://www.part15.us</a>

YSbCVt3Uaa	Meryl Streep was nominated for leading lady. So Philip Seymour Hoffman is a supporting character to hers as Sister Aloysius Beauvier.|`|dSmoB64Yaa	I beleive it has to do with how much the film centers on their Character. For example You could have a love story, with the woman as the viewpoint character, but if the film focused enough on the male character, he might be considered to be an actor in a leading role. I haven't seen the movie, but I know that it's about a nun who confronts a priest about his possible abuse of a student. Apparrently this is basically the nun's story, therefore the main male actor is doing a supporting role. Confusing, but I think that's how it works.|`|GYQaViUPaa	there probably isn't one, just Hoffman supporting Streep, there doesn't always have to be a main male role.|`|sLdhMK7Gaa	there is not lead actor but lead actress who happens to be meryl streep

P8gGMlbIaa	This will complicate things but..<br>  For best results you will want to remove all the parts from the runners to paint them. This is because if you do not you'll have a mark on the part where it was attached to the runner.  <br>  <br>  make sure the paint dries and test fit the parts together before glueing. I know the models are snap together, but my experience is the snap hold just isn't that great and some parts may need to be filed or sanded to fit flush with other parts. Which is when you should paint them after some parts are assembled, use tape to cover parts that you don't want painted.<br>  <br>  It's best to put decals on before any sealer. I know all the models come with peel on stickers, sucks don't they? You can always get some transfer paper and scan and print the stickers on to the decal paper and voila! your own decals!<br>  <br>  I remember a fellow gunplay fan told me there's a chemical you can use around the edges of transfer decals to blend them into the model's paint. This has the effect of making the decal look more as if it's been painted on.<br>  <br>  After all this then you can add any weathering if you want a MS that looks as if it's seen some action. Then you can add the sealer and it is done. A prefect model.

Your victim will scratch his head wondering why Cheerios came out of a box of Lucky Charms. <br>  <br>  Mail Box Prank <br>  After the mail has already been delivered, fill the mail box with ping pong balls or packing nuts. Then ask someone else to go get the mail. <br>  <br>  Lottery Ticket Swap<br>  This one takes some pre-planning. All you have to do is buy someone a lotto ticket today and tomorrow go out early and buy another ticket with the exact same numbers as the winning ticket from yesterday. When the victim of your prank isn't paying attention swap the newer ticket with the old one. When the person looks in the paper for the winning numbers, he or she won't even realize the date is wrong on the ticket and will believe it is the big winner. <br>  <br>  Bend Over Splits<br>  Place a dollar bill on the floor and as people walk by and try to pick the dollar up, you stand nearby and tear a small piece of cloth.

Then place an index card over the cup. Then turn the cup upside down on your co-worker's desk. Finally, carefully slide the index card out from underneath the cup. Whenever your co-worker decides to pick the cup up, he will be drenched in water. <br>  <br>  Bar Of Soap Lather Prank<br>  Take some nail polish and coat a bar of soap with it. Let it dry. Then put it in the bathroom shower. When your victim tries to use it, he or she will go nuts trying to get it to lather up. <br>  <br>  Ypto Ypto...errr!!! TYPO!<br>  Be carefull with this one, as to not ruin the keyboard. All you have to do is simply and very carefully remove a few keys and switch them around.

He or she will be very confused while trying to get work done. <br>  <br>  Confusing Drawers<br>  Before your co-worker arrives at the office remove his desk drawers and switch them around. He will definantly scratch his head over this one. Hint: In case you cannot remove the drawers, just remove the items and swap them. <br>  <br>  Ready For The Test?<br>  As soon as your victim walks into class, ask him if he is ready for the test today. If there is no test scheduled, your victim will panic. If he needs to confirm the test is today with someone else in class, usually a simple wink at whoever he asks will get the other student to play along with you.<br>  <br>  <br>  HIdden Channel Surfing<br>  Next time your teacher puts one of those boring videos on during class time.

There isn't really a popular group though... just two groups, each with a sub-group, and then the reject group. It's actually, like, really complicated. I'll try my best to explain :)<br>  <br>  There's two groups.<br>  Group One: Very athletic (with three or four girls who aren't athletic at all), not very smart, have a lot of friends from the co-ed Catholic school and our sister school, around 20 girls in their clique. They think they are really popular, but they are actually really nice (but sometimes very sarcastic)! They are also very exclusive. Within this group there are two groups. The entire group sits with each other at lunch, but they don't hang out with each other outside of school. Sometimes the group overlaps though and some girls are in both sub-sections of the large group.<br>  <br>  Group Two: Very smart (academics is HUGE in my school!), athletic (enough to make Varsity teams, but not enough to really excel in sports like Group One), have a lot of friends at our brother-school and the public schools, welcoming to anyone and pretty nice (although back-stabbing is a HUGE problem). They are also split into two sub-divisions. They too sit with each other at lunch, but don't all hang outside of school (although they know the same guys so the two sub-divisions aren't as defined at Group One).<br>  <br>  Group Three: Friends with EVERYONE in the grade, but only hang out with 5 people inside/outside school. They used to be my absolute best friends, but are VERY exclusive.<br>  <br>  Rejects: These people are really nice, but have no friends because they are disgusting (picking nose, farting, smelly, etc...) or just are autistic or something. There are only really 3 people in this group.<br>  <br>  I am basically in Group Two with friends in Group One and Group Three. I pretty much don't fit anywhere because I've been switching around groups for the last 5 years. I'm athletic, but get average grades so I don't really fit along with the Group Two stereotype. I am friends with four or five girls from Group One, but some people in that group are real b*tches so I tend not to hang out with them. Then the people in Group Three are all on scholarships and live in the city so it's too hard to hang out with them because they live so far away from everyone.<br>  <br>  So basically I'm pretty well-rounded. I'd say there really isn't a well-defined "popular" group, but I have 23 best friends in school (who I hang with out of school) and their is only around fifty girls in my grade. I'm friends (and best friends) with 35 out of these fifty.<br>  <br>  -Catherine|`|21734fbffcbf8e21d21f99205c491e6daa	no, but whatever.|`|XD5CBWKqaa	I've been to 3 different schools, my first school I went to I was popular, then my second school I went to I was kind of popular and the school I'm going to know I'm not that popular.|`|LlEC2x5Faa	Nope not at all. lol I'm kinda nerdish but i have nice clothes and ppl notice :D|`|uekjuNpNaa	Nope.:)<br>  I just like to be Me:)<br>  ?|`|1ad5u4UFaa	Not one bit.|`|RSv2E2KNaa	No..

UAHjJpC0aa	None that will sound any good<br>  <br>  those are 3 totally different instruments<br>  that really need different amps.<br>  <br>  The bass wants to see a flat, natural sound, <br>  a LOT of power (bass notes really suck it up)<br>  and VERY heavy duty speakers, (again, those low notes are very hard on speakers, and will blow most guitar speakers)<br>  <br>  The electric guitar doesn't need much power, <br>  most prefer low wattage amps, (around 40 watts) so you can "push" the amp a little.<br>  <br>  You can plug a guitar into a bass amp, it just doesn't sound very good most of the time.<br>  Guitar amps are "voiced" differently, to make them sound the way our ears want to hear them.<br>  Easy to shown hard to explain.<br>  <br>  The Mic/PA, is closer to the bass almost,<br>  again, it wants to be a flat, very "natural sound."<br>  the difference is that you need better high end response, for a PA, because the frequencies are different.<br>  <br>  If you "HAVE" to get just one amp<br>  maybe look at some of the 100 watt Roland Keyboard amps?<br>  <br>  they do have multiple channels, and can handle lows better than a guitar amp.<br>  <br>  but the "sound" will not be right, for some of the songs, <br>  and you will have to keep the volume down low,<br>  The bass guitar will suck up almost ALL the power !<br>  <br>  Keep in mind, that a 100 watt amp does NOT put out a 100 for "each" of the 3 instruments !<br>  It's 100 watts TOTAL !<br>  If the bass is using 60 watts, and the PA is using 40 watts, there is no power left for the guitar
C1BOtavjaa	Numb definately. Numb encore isn't as good.|`|hFnSEAGjaa	I like them both but I prefer numb (not a big jay z fan )  I think numb would be better for your project because unless your teacher is a jay z fan, he/she probably wouldn't like it.|`|L1SUubQvaa	well what's the topic of your project? you don't give us enough info. please out more!|`|AA10954497	cool song|`|khwr87SVaa	both are emo and emos piss me off listen to good music
XNIkS3KNaa	Thank you!! Thank you!! Thank you!!<br>  <br>  I never would of known that and I would missed out on a huge sale if you hadn't posted this!!  So again THANK YOU!!<br>  <br>  I'm going to be going to the best buy in East Orange California, it's actually a bran new store close to my house. XD<br>  <br>  I'm going to buy what ever great animes I can get! :)|`|P8gGMlbIaa	I'm surprised. My local Best Buy isn't on that list. Which is a surprise because Altoona passed Erie to be 3rd largest in PA, or maybe that was Scranton.<br>  <br>  I buy online anyways from DVD Pacific, lower prices than Best Buys. So I can't participate in this sale anyways.<br>  <br>  I believe the next Lucky Star and School Rumble 2nd semester part 2 should be out by now, as well as the boxed set for Utawarumono.|`|AA12046768	Wow I didn't know that, but I am really not surprised. The last 3 times I have gone to my local Best Buy to buy anime, every single title I wanted they either didn't carry or were gone because they didn't get enough copies in. One time they had the DVD's but no one could locate them! So I said screw them and ordered them online from Target, their prices are almost the same and in some instances cheaper. So because of Best Buys inability to keep titles in stock or know what they have, they have lost a long time customer. I am just sick of their crap.|`|445724d0f53c59057d2b2139781c1204aa	Ohh <br>  No wonder they were selling a Naruto DVD for only $15 instead of $20. Well good job for finding this.|`|2jxWrnUGaa	Ahhahaah!! Thanks soooooooooooooo MUCHH!!<br>  i could have missed out on something big!!<br>  Eeekkk!! so excited!!<br>  i plan on buying any anime i can get my hands on!!<br>  ^_^<br>  you rock!! thanks again!!|`|4UeOIGuhaa	NOO! T___T<br>  <br>  I dont have any money so Dx<br>  <br>  Dang it T_T|`|pTERJdzQaa	SWEET!!!!! Thats Awesome!!!!<br>  <br>  It is a great that stores are going to lessen the prices of Anime-related merchandise!!!!!<br>  <br>  To bad: None of the participating stores in this event are any near where I live :[<br>  <br>  I could still go to one, but it would take me hours to get there ×_×<br>  <br>  Interesting question though. ^_^|`|dYQUQGflaa	I will not be shopping with Best Buy to get this cheap anime, nor will I to get anything from them.  They tricked and scammed my sister out of $400 and the RAM in her computer even though it should have been covered by an expensive warranty.|`|YHu0TUxdaa	d@MN! The nearest store is in the next town of Dekalb. lol. I will shop even thou i have had amazingly bad experiences with then, and with the very poor customer service. I'll buy any thng Evangelion, Elfen lied, or whatever appels to me that's left.
kJM65nXJaa	No, but sometimes I fell like a nut, sometimes I don't.|`|R7x0qIqyaa	That's life.|`|MwSaCettaa	Wow, you took the words right outta my mouth!!!

Other than focusing on wat makes us feel happier, there's nothing better than wat we can do.<br>  <br>  If life is cruel, is this place consider hell? cuz we r been punish here? or rather we r been tested here to go to a higher level?<br>  <br>  If love is a practical joker, how come we r not laughing? Cuz love is not for leisure, it makes us die for it. To me, it's more like a desire for us to feel that we r still living with a heart in this world.<br>  <br>  If time is the fire we all burn, then i better not waste too much time. Cuz i didn't want to get old, feel lonely & regret for not doing much while im still young.|`|mxjT0o58aa	Very true.

To differentiate the 2 of us, he was called "Pony Tail Dave"(rest in peace) and I was called "Big Dave"<br>  <br>  Then my bouncer friend showed up 3 years after the trend started and he dwarfs me considerably.

Quack!|`|0ectWZxAaa	No. Because when you actually research it... Jesus is almost 100 percent identical to Horus. From the "Egyptian book of the dead" Which is pretty funny because Horus was folk lore. <br>  <br>  I am agnostic, I believe there might be something, But not the Christian God.|`|uWJnb1Y9aa	yes b/c he is the only thing that makes sense|`|GBGcI509aa	Yup.|`|lo4D4EEiaa	No, because if he's so fricken great why is there so much **** happening in the world. If he really did exist and he ******* loves us then why do we go through this ******* crap everyday.... Until i see proof that he exists, for now i say he doesn't ...|`|N1JFX1yGaa	Yes<br>  Because how would we come to be? I believe in God and Heaven but not what the bible says. I am not a known christian but that's what i think.|`|o5Tb8ZQ0aa	yes but not the way christian fundies do thats for sure|`|1YTmgAc3aa	God is life, life is rooted in everything and we are apart of everything else...<br>  I believe in God|`|NJfpY7nIaa	Yes.<br>  I don't need a reason to justify<br>  my beliefs/faith.|`|JpvXhgmraa	Not a "god" but a creator somewhere down the line|`|WKcJE9bKaa	No, because I don't believe in Santa and the easter bunny either.|`|hHjfoKEHaa	I do.

But God. Not really no. I wish i did sometimes. But i doubt God exists. I do not believe he created me.I give credit to my mom and dad for that. I believe in evolution- because i have a brain. And if i were to believe in god. Then that god would have to have a great sense of humor and love of curse words. :) and enjoy long walks on the beach, love vodka, and ooh must love rollercoasters. :)|`|yLuzqHInaa	Hes my life,so yes.Because he created all of us an evolution is not true!!|`|E9WnOUltaa	im not really religious , however i believe there is a good..i dont believe that he created the world by himself and i also dont believe in the bible stories..however i believe there is someone of much greatness thats a spirit....i dont attend church or any place of worship but often when im sad or upset or have a friend in need il pray to god to look after them.<br>  x|`|HcjuS3z6aa	yes because it doesnt make sense that everything was created my molecules and atoms and the fact that scientist cant begin to explain straight up of how we were created and also scientist cant explain if there is no god so they do sort of belive and im a proud catholic!!!<333=]|`|vs3eMaQ3aa	Yes.|`|1PN5Ga12aa	yes because i am a catholic =]|`|FRnhPjhBaa	of course i do, im a christian & proud & i am an alter server to serve him<br>  how else would the world be created? if he didnt exist, why do so many of us believe in him & go to church? because some drunk guy went to school & instead of spelling DOG he spelled GOD?<br>  or some crazy person just made him up? no.<br>  to all the people that dont believe in him, i am very disappointed.|`|qwInrvUGaa	yes<br>  <br>  because i wanna|`|h0S31CUXaa	uhm,<br>  not really.<br>  im not sure yet actually.<br>  i go to a catholic school though :|<br>  but i kinda dont believe<br>  <br>  he just seems unrealistic to me.<br>  and ppl say<br>  'god created human,<br>  or human created god'<br>  and my pick is that human created god|`|EbkJlX0xaa	Yes.  Mostly because it just makes sense.|`|D8sN8gNFaa	I don't, but at the same time I don't deny it's existence, I'm just not quite sure if the universe needed anything to put it in motion and existence.|`|2pza1t5kaa	still deciding; i'm raised catholic, though.|`|seBRm073aa	yes|`|ySFQ2TDWaa	Yes, i do. theres no reason for it|`|PgHIaseiaa	yea i do because my faith is islam|`|T1Exjnyraa	yes. because is my savior and my Shepard and the only 1 i fear.|`|QrbwYLaIaa	yes because he is our creator|`|0VbAMZccaa	NO. because God doesnt exist.

How else do you explain EVERYTHING?|`|ODvnyAdlaa	yes i do, because i believe he is the reason for my existence x|`|1YNFFfmWaa	Yes I do, because I can and just do.|`|JDkSYNmNaa	Yes, because I believe in God.<br>  (:|`|jlHz0Fg1aa	No.  I have no rational reason to believe some all-powerful being created the universe in seven days, formulated some ridiculous world, created man, then left us alone for 6,000 years.<br>  <br>  I'd just as soon believe a Flying Spaghetti Monster did it.|`|sHzPnGXHaa	yes i do<br>  <br>  why <br>  <br>  because i said so|`|k0Ewe7mCaa	No, because he doesn't exist.|`|Vh9P5P60aa	I believe in the possibility that a one true God may or may not exist.<br>  <br>  Because at this time to the best of my knowledge there is not sufficient facts that a true God exists, therefore I remain open to the possibility.|`|GBr7TphLaa	Yes because I'm a Christian and he created me.

AA10053661	I love buying them. I have shelves and shelves filling my house. Sometimes when I'm just in a quiet mood, I can go and look through the many books and pick a fav and read it again. I seriously can't stand giving a book back to the library when I just LOVE the book. So I really do love to buy them..... and keep them. <br>  <br>  Funny thing..... when my daughter was really little, we went to the video store and rented some movies. We left and she said, "You know mommy... they should have a place like that for books!" I just laughed and said, "They do..... it's called a library!" I knew at that point that she knew all about book stores but not about libraries! lol I remedied that problem quickly. <br>  <br>  Nice question!|`|GwwcqUCoaa	I buy them. No time pressures... I’m free to enjoy them when I want.|`|wPnJekdqaa	Buying them. That way I can read them whenever I want and at the pace I want without fear of a fine and I also know that they're in excellent condition with all the pages intact. Too many times I've taken books out of the library to find pages missing in the middle.|`|YvuCN6qWaa	I'd rather buy em because 1. I can never find the book I want from the library 2. They're always screwed up and dirty and 3. I don't know which section to go to to look for my books haha|`|b8c32d57b4a1336f94b426a5879ff6f7aa	Borrowed of course, I work at the library.|`|oT7PFjeJaa	borrow

Iz1oTfKfaa	I don't hold a grudge against anyone other than myself; being p.o.'ed at others for an extended period of time seems to be a waste of valuable time and effort.  After all, the actions of others toward me are usually a response to something I've done/said to them, right?|`|UEzTKxwYaa	Revenge! It's sweet.|`|UZEEKKPeaa	I don't hold grudges either.|`|G1VsV0wWaa	They never find the bodies...lol|`|fG1h5WKxaa	plot out revenge....i cnt help it|`|luQ1N9rSaa	Well, sure I could forgive and forget but wheres the fun in that???<br>  <br>  Plotting out revenge is tons more fun.........<br>  <br>  Bwahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah...|`|PHYGU5DQaa	Both Really.<br>  If I Cant Be Arsed To Plot Revenge, Then I Forgive But Don't Forget.

I'll let karma handle the payback.|`|e46bfb629b3ff9ef7e6ccedfe85b2926aa	Forgive and forget. Until the moment for revenge appears.|`|LmARYQxcaa	I can easily forgive...however I will always remember.|`|cgfbfc6Vaa	Forgive and Forget:)|`|nnOVIOV9aa	I have no time for revenge.  I leave that for the delusional people...|`|TsmqhvZHaa	forgive, forget, and move on|`|dE5m2Krmaa	I move on and forget. I'm not vindictive at all.|`|67f34282988bfc3fb8c3c876e7296801aa	I forgive but I have a hard time forgetting|`|b93b5b7d69b5052348a1e1de6ae4b4f7aa	I forgive - if someone seems to know what they've done wrong, and regrets it. If they don't know, or don't care that they've done something wrong, I'm not going to forgive, just to get hurt again. <br>  I don't plot revenge though, I just don't forgive... You don't have to hurt someone, just don't get close to them again.|`|tA1ztvXaaa	I have always forgiven people even at the expense of my own happiness, in the end I have learned that it's not worth it the hard way.  I am not a person that takes revenge, i think the people to take advantage of one's kind hearted forgiveness are the most vindictive|`|HqwO5LZaaa	Revenge.<br>  <br>  Think up of ways of revenge,<br>  It makes me happy.<br>  But I still remember what they did to me,<br>  I can never forget.<br>  <br>  (Im stubborn and tend to hold grudges)|`|ZteoS74raa	I will always forgive, but I never forget...you can't learn lessons if you forget.|`|Z51fjE2Raa	I plot out revenge... follow it through- then forget about that revenge... so I'll do another revenge.<br>  <br>  mua ha haa|`|PjvaWVEVaa	I always forgive, but I never forget.|`|5aI77YF8aa	I definitely hold grudges, but I only get revenge if that person can't hurt me. Otherwise I just stay mad at them. haha =]|`|M3H4NtrAaa	I plot out revenge, but dont normally go through with it. So most of the time I forgive but NEVER forget.|`|IgEYfBPJaa	i forgive but still remember :)|`|KQJPWWjeaa	Depends on the situation.  But it's hard to forget things that have hurt you.|`|QEqGukjZaa	forgive and forget cuz there human=)..<br>  <br>  revenge is evil...but I dont blame Jason Voorhees for doing what he did..they did let him drown..|`|JWSCTek3aa	I have a bad short term memory.<br>  it serves me well.<br>  <br>  no grudges here.|`|2PTlXs9zaa	I plot out revenge in my mind, using it as a way to release the anger. I don't ever carry things like that out, it's just a relief valve for me. Then I get over it and move forward.<br>  <br>  er, wow, Tubs almost had me convinced.. ever play poker with her?|`|4WCLWhaTaa	It depends on how much it affected me and/or my loved ones or how much effort I feel like putting into it.|`|wekHkN2Aaa	revenge|`|QV02KUDRaa	Plot...I hold alot of grudges|`|d0b19b6e53bf5f04f7ade24285468c28aa	i forgive but dont forget|`|BpMI22Lbaa	Never forgive and forget that is the dumbest thing you could do because revenge is so much sweeter than forgiveness!!   <br>  No offence to anyone who would forgive and forget but it just seems like you're too scared to fight. <br>  I can be very cruel and it is in my nature to seek revenge if necessary so this question is very easy for me.|`|mdhZU9zjaa	If it is my brother.. then i plot out revenge.. it depends on what the person did.. if it was like a prank or sumthin then i plot out revenge.. if it was something more serious.. i forget .. it depends on what the person did to see how long it takes me to forgive... Although, i cant hold grudges for long.. like seriously.. 2 hours is like a max.. sorry for all the elipses.. TAKE CARE!!|`|HCL7FpTqaa	I do not hold grudges, but I do remember what's been done for future reference.  <br>  <br>  I'd rather just stop liking someone than hold a grudge against them.|`|fv2GAAdPaa	I try not to hold grudges but it happens sometimes so...Forgive and forget.<br>  <br>  =]|`|oDGttkmLaa	forgive and forget. The forget part is easy b/c my memory is awful. Some people I hold grudges against. It just depends on if the matter makes sense or not.|`|VoKzvoxKaa	forgive and forget

MlCWsBcwaa	Hands down Gary Sinise.  He plays Mac so well.  There is so much going on with Mac even when he is not talking, and it seems like Gary Sinise has it so measured, so it almost seems like no emotion, but it is there.  He nailed Mac Taylor right in the first episode, especially the last ten minutes, when he is telling the victim in hospital about his wife and then goes to Ground Zero.

You can get it here:<br>  <a href="http://picasa.google.com/" rel="nofollow">http://picasa.google.com/</a><br>  This isn't in Photoshop's league, but it's full of easy-to-use functions for the kind of corrections most people want -- red eye, color, etc. <br>  <br>  If you want something more like Photoshop, there's the GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program). The user interface is kind of quirky, but it's really powerful. <br>  <a href="http://www.gimp.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gimp.org/</a><br>  <br>  Adobe (the maker of Photoshop) has a free version of their PhotoShop Album software. This is mostly for organizing photos on your PC, but it does basic photo corrections as well. <br>  <a href="http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshopalbum/starter.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photosh...</a><br>  <br>  Some on-line photo sites also offer image manipulation tools. They're slow unless you have good broadband, but that's usually just due to the transfer process.. the tools themselve are very Web2.0 style and run fast enough in your web browser. Adobe's is perhaps the most powerful of these as a photo editor: <a href="https://www.photoshop.com/express/landing.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.photoshop.com/express/landin...</a><br>  <br>  FotoFlexer is just the on-line editor... they claim to edit photos stored on other sites, and claim to be powerful. Who knows, but check it out here: <a href="http://fotoflexer.com/" rel="nofollow">http://fotoflexer.com/</a><br>  <br>  There are many, many others.. you'll probably find one that fits your needs and skills. Here are some articles that point out the others:<br>  <a href="http://www.alltipsandtricks.com/10-free-photo-editors-at-your-choice/" rel="nofollow">http://www.alltipsandtricks.com/10-free-...</a><br>  <a href="http://graphicssoft.about.com/od/pixelbasedwin/tp/freephotoedw.htm" rel="nofollow">http://graphicssoft.about.com/od/pixelba...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.basic-digital-photography.com/top-5-free-photo-editors-for-windows.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.basic-digital-photography.com...</a>|`|MdXwD2JSaa	None of the programs you can download for free will have stuff for fixing skin tone and such I'm pretty sure.

Q4sgYeMLaa	Start Stretching For A LONG time.<br>  But if that doesn't help. Work up to the jump. Then when you jump look up and push you're chest up. It'll get your jump higher. If your chest is upward, then you'll be more likely to get the jump higher.<br>  It takes time, and if you're doing it on the tramp then you'll be able to do it on the ground. Just keep jumping your highest. To get them overall better would just to be doing them everyday, or on the tramp do your toe touch and just hold it untill you hit the tramp, it'll get your legs and hips flexible.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|ZjM0ghSnaa	just keep stretching on the ground, and then jump on the ground. thats the only way.

I was 11 and my mother thought it was like The Rugrats movie or something so she took me, my 9 year old brother and 7 year old sister to see it. Boy were we influenced. My first question after the movie was "Mom, where can I find the clitoris?" <br>  <br>  My poor mom was traumatized. Luckily, a few other parents made the same "mistake", so no one thought she was a bad mom.<br>  I am 20 now, and sometimes she still watches it with me :D|`|lFzFtiCBaa	I really liked the first 4 seasons but it got way too political and predictable after that. There have been funny new ones, but nothing like the first few years.<br>  <br>  Family Guy is off the chain funny and has also replaced Frasier as "The Smartest Show On TV"|`|sUBA3Ecgaa	"mmkay class"Lao is hilarious, it has a unique  humor!!<br>  "the Danish are the Canadians of Europe"lmao|`|6oHbJznXaa	i like some parts but i can't laugh at what i wanna laugh at when i watch stuff now. it's dumb|`|2lTMxh8eaa	YesMyFavoriteIsWhereTheyGetHighOffOfCatU...|`|t6yN1yxtaa	i love it but i cant watch it with my mom at home<br>  but either way it is hilarious|`|h2i92yA7aa	I love it.

I will listen to anything from classical to classic rock. There's so much to explore in different types of music. Many would question my cd collection though..........<br>  <br>  Anyways, I also belong to a gun club and am a former member of 4-H shooting sports. I made nationals twice. <br>  <br>  Art also made it into there. Though I do draw in the manga style, I do veer off that path and sketch photos or something like that. Finally, I am alos a movie fanatic. Mostly comedy though. I have over 90 movies in my room right now that are NOT related to anime or manga. My fave right now is Better Off Dead, a John Cusak movie. <br>  <br>  As you can see, I have a life entirely not related to anime and manga 24/7. <br>  <br>  Your music tastes are pretty cool (jazz rocks). <br>  <br>  nya|`|v1hCymAEaa	Thats cool that your an animation major in college!

Any Hip-Hop or Punk Rock.|`|gJhwH335aa	I'm a Computer Science Engineering student major in Software Engineering though I already graduates from University last year. Planning to further my study to a higher level but I will probably doing so by the end of this year. I'm taking a one year break from my non stop studying schedule right now. No more interruption for me! Ya-tah! >:D<br>  <br>  Hobbies and Interest<br>  <br>  Music<br>  - Music always plays a big part in my life. Honestly, I'm not into anime that much. I collect lots of manga because I like comic books. I don't feel the urge to read as many manga as I can like most people on this section does to achieve that Otaku title. My manga collection is enough to keep them shut. Muhahaha >:D<br>  <br>  - I listened to all kind of music but I prefer rock n rollah ^__^ which emphasizes the used of guitar, bass and drums. The music felt more 'honest' and 'moving' that way if you know what I mean.<br>  <br>  - I'm in a band (two separate band to be exact) and I play drum on both band. One band plays pop punk, ska and sometimes slow / soft rock.<br>  <a href="http://s604.photobucket.com/albums/tt124/filthylilsecret_album/?action=view&current=ayatollahofrocknrollah.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s604.photobucket.com/albums/tt124...</a><br>  - While the other one is more into hard rock / metal genre (mostly Metalcore and Melodeath).<br>  <a href="http://s604.photobucket.com/albums/tt124/filthylilsecret_album/?action=view&current=Session.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s604.photobucket.com/albums/tt124...</a><br>  - I also have a side project that plays dark pop and horror punk. I'm a rhythm guitarist on that band (because I can't play lead) >__<<br>  <br>  Traveling<br>  - I love travel and having an adventure (which is why I love One Piece, hehe). I went to Hong Kong last week during Valentines day, bullshiting with my (single) friends (boys and girls) because we don't have a partner. >:D<br>  - Its not necessarily outside the country though because usually we go on a road trip (by car) together. Its a guy romance!<br>  <br>  Book<br>  - I enjoy reading. I read anything from autobiography to historical and my last reading is Sun Tzu The Art of War. <br>  <a href="http://s604.photobucket.com/albums/tt124/filthylilsecret_album/?action=view&current=bookshelves4.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s604.photobucket.com/albums/tt124...</a><br>  <br>  Sport<br>  - Skateboarding<br>  <a href="http://s604.photobucket.com/albums/tt124/filthylilsecret_album/?action=view&current=out.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s604.photobucket.com/albums/tt124...</a><br>  - I skate for about 5 years now. Not as often as I used to but I still enjoy skateboarding once in a while.<br>  <br>  Movie and TV. <br>  - I watch movie each week :O The last movie I watch is Punisher : War Zone. The action kicks *** but the plot and story is a meh. Another superheroes movie that contains American propaganda -__-" I'm more eager on watching Watchmen movie next week though. The trailer looks awesome especially on Dr Manhattan godlike scene.<br>  - I think watch more TV show than anime series. Some of my favorite is Prison Break, Lost, Angel, Heroes, Seinfeld, House, CSI Las Vegas (didn't really like the other two), Xtesters, Mythbusters, Miami Ink (didn't care for KatVonD spin off) and a lot more.<br>  <br>  Gaming.<br>  - I don't play game as often as I used to be because I spend more time outdoor. The last game I played on PS2 is Dragon Ball Budokai Tenkaichi 3. Just about to enter GT saga. I play more game (mostly PC) when I was at the University though. Heh, typical student that procrastinates while working on an assignment.<br>  <br>  - Uh, now that I listed the above things. I think manga (not counting anime because I hardly watch anime) only revolved around 4-5% in my life :O <br>  - So much for being one of the Top Contributor on C&A section eh? ^__^|`|3EnpyuS0aa	hiya!<br>  ^_^<br>  <br>  -i think everybody knows im a teacher.<br>  since it's my job's nature to be online most of the time then i also do some blogging...but not that much<br>  <br>  -im also a makeup junkie...<br>  which means that i collect makeups & the likes...<br>  <br>  -love going out every weekends meeting friends & bf<br>  <br>  -i do play ps2....currently im playing red ninja & suikoden tactics<br>  <br>  -i love doing girly stuff....(shopping, sleep overs, pajama party, makeup party,etc.)<br>  <br>  XP|`|b10c5828972384201aa770b9f00357b7aa	I love reading novels or short stories, playing Sudoku, playing the piano and my best hobby >net surfing< !!|`|cTA6OmjUaa	Sports, reading, i play the harmonica and guitar, and play poker too much.|`|G5weg8gCaa	Watch movies<br>  Play video games<br>  Skating<br>  Horseback riding<br>  Swimming<br>  Baking<br>  Going out with my friends<br>  Shopping <br>  Listening  to music|`|6qDhXpWfaa	I love indie music - death cab for cute, stars, iron and wine...<br>  <br>  I'm also a book worm and watch j dramas =D<br>  <br>  oh and I go to uni at UBC - hoorah!|`|9ZSTqn76aa	I do 3-d animation, drawing, and sports|`|XNIkS3KNaa	I love to draw all kinds of things from portraits, anime, landscapes and more.

TxvWkK1Zaa	People just stereotype these days. They think that skirts are feminine and only females should wear them, so if men wear them, they want to get in touch with their feminine side to attract men, so they must be gay. <br>  <br>  I don't think that. I think guys in skirts are different and have a personality. They're not afraid to show who they really are and I appreciate that. It depends if they've got the legs for it though. Hehe|`|0JHIO0g5aa	its liek teh purse thing... they r only made for girls and women|`|VA3tGarQaa	I don't. I think they're transvestites. Doesn't necessarily mean they like men.<br>  <br>  Hey, why the thumbs down? I'm stating a fact. A man who wears women's clothing is a transvestite. There's no escaping that. It's not like it's a derogatory term.|`|Q0Fxqcdhaa	Maybe because it is stereotypical for girls to only wear skirts? In my opinion, they can wear what they want, no ones stopping them from wearing skirts, except others opinions.|`|3AAHmvKFaa	I guess it's because alot of us are brought up to believe skirts are only for girls so seeing a guy wear a skirt; you'd think he'd want to be a girl...|`|uLHtXibRaa	Unless its a kilt its very not masculine..and i would run a mile from a man wearing a skirt...|`|aedceb08696b2203d062066bb87dc753aa	throughout history there have been stereotypes associated with fashion,clothes that would be considered " feminine" now days were thought of as normal years back while most current fashions would be considered bizarre to say people in victorian england,it's all about perspective clothes are just cloth

q3KCDrMAaa	Attractive and sexy to me can be two different things.<br>  <br>  Sexy: Aquarius females and Scorpio males<br>  Why: Aquarius women are BRILLIANT flirts. They can be the ugliest, most unattractive women yet they can capture a man's attention like crazy! They are smart too. They tend to be Jacks of All Trades and they give the impression that they enjoy communicating with any and every one. <br>  <br>  Scorpio men give off a very a very sensitive vibe that can be very attractive to women. They have a dark intensity and when they first meet you, they don't push. <br>  <br>  Attractive: Libra females and Aries men<br>  Why: Libra women are attractive because Venus rules Libra. They tend to just be pretty to to eye, because they tend to have large eyes and very baby looking faces. <br>  <br>  Aries men like themselves alot. So they tend to keep in shape and want to appear attractive. So they work on it.|`|ythN9BQgaa	Virgos, Pisces' and Sagittarius'<br>  <br>  Edit: OH! Forgot Capricorns..

I work out for myself.|`|CUpWy0jiaa	lol honestly if a guy is that worried about his looks he is gay.  Guys have no problem saying that they are ugly.

DaYKDwNvaa	I have a couple:<br>  <br>  Why did tigger look in the toilet?<br>  He was looking for pooh!<br>  <br>  Two blondes were shopping at the mall. When they were done, they went out to their car, which happened to be an awesome leather-interior convertible, but they realized they had locked the keys in the car. So they both kind of stood there and thought for a while.<br>  <br>  Then one of the girls had the bright idea to try to open the car with a coat hanger, so she started fiddling with the lock. The other blonde looked up at the sky, became very worried, and pleaded,<br>  <br>  "HURRY, HURRY, IT'S GOING TO RAIN AND WE LEFT THE TOP DOWN!"<br>  <br>  Another one could be<br>  <br>  A vampire bat came flapping in from the night covered in fresh blood and parked himself on the roof of the cave to get some sleep.<br>  <br>  Pretty soon all the other bats smelled the blood and began hassling him about where he got it.<br>  <br>  He told them to go away and let him get some sleep but they persisted until finally he gave in.<br>  <br>  "OK, follow me" he said and flew out of the cave with hundreds of bats behind him.<br>  <br>  Down through the valley they went, across a river and into a forest full of trees.<br>  <br>  Finally he slowed down and all the other bats excitedly milled around him.<br>  <br>  "Now, do you see that tree over there?" he asked.<br>  <br>  "Yes, Yes, Yes!" the bats all screamed in a frenzy.<br>  <br>  "Good" said the bat, "Because I sure as hell didn't!"|`|WADWJqEMaa	My brother made this one up: "Did you hear that those two insurance companies merged? Yeah. I believe it was 'Progressive' and 'Statefarm'. Now the one company is called 'Prostate'."<br>  <br>  It made me giggle.<br>  Kay|`|qmmJWOQDaa	So 2 atoms are walking together and one says, "I just lost and electron."

pC6KstvHaa	I am! I still love his music.  I totally agree with you, no one knows what happened yet, and his personal life doesn't affect his music, which is what he is giving to us, not his personal life.  So i think everyone should butt out.|`|SSN3qtI2aa	UM i guess he had some reasons but i really don't think violence is the answer. Everyone makes mistakes if he pays the price and accepts what he did wrong than its fine. Sure some people would hate him but im pretty sure if Brittney Spears got a comeback and people love her personally id never look up to her the same way i did before or chris brown, i don't hate him but i think that was wrong to use violence and i know he was mad at her but that's not really appropriate to do something like that to a girl.|`|92fNY4Fvaa	yah, you are the only one not hating on him<br>  <br>  i had a friend who was abused by her boyfriend repeatedly. so, it kinda hits close to home when you see how its affects the person being hit. its stupid, and chris brown clearly has issues, that he could have dealt with in other ways, there was no reason for him to EVER put one hand on her.|`|5NfQaM45aa	i dont hate him at alll!! when i heard chris and riahnna were dating i was jealous like hell! but i still loved him and his music :) amybe it's because riahnna deserved it. i mean she was clingy aka always with him all the time. so yea u not the only one who's not hating him.|`|u0xvF3UOaa	Nope.<br>  I don't hate on him.<br>  Nobody knows the real story so nobody has the right to say anything.|`|ew7nQKXSaa	If you are a teen, you have more things to worry about than Chris Brown or Rhianna.<br>  <br>  Has it ever occurred to you that your parent(s) could lose their job(s) within the next week?<br>  <br>  Do you think Chris Brown or Rhianna is going to mail your parent(s) an unemployment check?<br>  <br>  GROW UP and DO SOMETHING PRODUCTIVE!

F9EvPa1Uaa	no, i rather be myself. Also, the populare kids that went to my brother high school end up bad.  Some of the girls end up fat and popping out kids, some of the boys end up fat, bald, usually some of the popular kids end up working at low paying jobs. But only a little of them did alright.|`|tlLoQUsuaa	NO i don't wanna be.<br>  NO i'm not.<br>  and because they're stuck up b*tches.<br>  i have my friends and thats all i need :]|`|BwMJ3Jlkaa	No and No<br>  <br>  because I do not like attention|`|lk3W1VJHaa	I Am<br>  <br>  <br>  Yes.|`|cNdkNYKOaa	i really don't care about popularity<br>  i was me in high school<br>  i hung out with at least one person from every social group<br>  i don't need a bunch of shallow people to tell me that i am cool<br>  i can figure that out for myself|`|E5rhAaLGaa	No.<br>  No.<br>  Im friends with everyone, but hang around mostly with my own friends.<br>  I wouldn't say im popular. Just friends with everyone :)|`|b1u9jlRhaa	I was the most popular guy at high school, I was a bad boy, and I loved sluts. and I still love them. I suppose cause I have so much confident and I`m damn hot.|`|fBXRNKyuaa	I would hate to be popular. Those girls are so plastic. None of the guys even like them because they are so self involved.|`|mzhFrm5Taa	Nah. I really don't care to be either. I don't like being the centre of attention.|`|ODvnyAdlaa	yes im pretty popular, its better than being hated i guess xx|`|Tj2xROpwaa	no im fine with my friends. no drama.|`|JpvXhgmraa	not really, too much drama, I'm cool with my freinds|`|umUiScliaa	Yes i want to be popular, i think deep down everyone does, they want to know they are liked by there peer's. Im not in high school yet but there are all types of cliques and so you could be popular in that clique. I like my group of friends just the way they are now and i wouldnt change anything!!! :-)|`|cLU6nGWwaa	I'm popular. Not for being a bubbly cheerleader though. I am really creative and wild! I am very random, so I talk to random people...<br>  o_O<br>  But I HATE stuck up people who look in window to check how they look. I don't want to be like that. <br>  For the other question- No, being popular isn't important at all. As long as the people I care about like me, then what does it matter if a hater dislikes you? I always say that if someone is being a b*tch to you, hate them back, or just knock them out. JK!|`|SlR0Cp5saa	No because although a lot of people like you, a lot of people also hate you.<br>  <br>  Right now, I'm not popular but I'm not a loser. I'm Switzerland!|`|Yd2wblseaa	No I would not like to be popular because you have fake friends and if you mess up you'll have no friends at all. Plus everyone talks bad about everyone in the popular group.|`|5gnlVmMzaa	?i move around a lot and i've always been "popular" except one year when i was hated from my ethnicity. it sucked?|`|BjmJharpaa	No way!<br>  <br>  The popular people in my school are soo annoying<br>  I'm fine with the way I am at school right now<br>  And no I wasn't popular in highschool cause I havn't been there yet =]|`|V6oPIVLZaa	i am in high school and i am the cheer caption and i love it expect hate drama|`|sUBA3Ecgaa	I was popular in high school<br>  why?..because I went to "high school" in Russia and the class was only 12 students!!|`|ZLI6K9Qmaa	I couldn't care less.<br>  <br>  No I wasn't. I was pretty much a loner. I had a small group of friends that I hung out with, most were guys.|`|WfEGJys3aa	no im not popular...but i have a lot of friends......<br>  <br>  <br>  nd no idnt want to be popular too much drama|`|igI5yX0vaa	Yes<br>  Not particularly<br>  <br>  I would want to be popular in my profession in that I would like companies clamoring to hire me.|`|GBr7TphLaa	I'm not popular but I have a lot of friends.

They honestly don't give a sh*t about designer brands. If you look sexy in a dress from Target, that will be plenty good to them. In other words, it's better to look good in a hot little dress from Target for $5.99 than to wear an ugly, hideous dress from Prada that costs $850.|`|x1KFIIpNaa	They notice nothing except you. Believe me! So don't fret about what clothes you wear, how you talk and walk, etc. They notice you and your beauty behing all your overloaded makeup (if you wear any, which you probably do. I mean who doesn't). Only you and NOTHING else!|`|d4c9a4d52a9e77de4545721ac937c02faa	Who knows. One time a guy tried to guess the brand of my purse, it was chanel, he asked if it was d&b lol|`|S0x0ctP3aa	Good question!<br>  I'm not a guy, but I doubt they notice name brands (they're not that smart! Your giving them to much credit.)|`|6XdhoNRIaa	Guys, honestly, don't really care about brands :].<br>  They care much more about what clothes you wear, and more importantly how you look. If you're pretty, there's a high chance it doesn't matter what kind of clothes you wear (unless they're really bad lol).<br>  <br>  They notice nail polish, they might think its nice or not, but I don't think they care about it an extent that it will change their interest in a girl. Something we do really like is your hair! Hope that helps =)|`|vkYpTds8aa	lol<br>  i dont think a guy cares what your wearing as long as you look go in it|`|f5oZRD6faa	My guy friend couldnt even remember did i have blonde hair or brown....|`|0P5qBxiZaa	who cares :D

fpS1f29Haa	all together? probably 2 hours. double spaced means like your writing 3/4 of a page each. take away an intro and and ending, you only have lik 1/2 a page of facts and details. and the topics are very literal so you could do research and find everything you need. there's really no creativity or though in any of those topics so you should be fine.

wKt2WljZaa	All of us have different likings. It all depends on mood as well. I am not sure which kind of journey u would like to have right now but i will just give you some of my personal favourites:<br>  1) Finding Neverland<br>         It is the story centered around a Scottish playwriter, played by Johnny Depp, whose friendly relationship with a widow, Kate Winslet, and her children inspired him to write Peter Pan(the boy who goes to neverland and never grows old).<br>  2) Sweet November<br>       Keanu Reeves and Charlize Theron played the lead roles. Reeves has played a man devoted only to his advertising career, met a larger than life girl falls in love with her. But if you think that everything goes happily ever after. Just think again and check out this flick. It has some great moments. <br>     These two beautifully made movies can leave u with full of emotions in the end.<br>  3) A beautiful mind<br>         Story of triumph of the human spirit.

hceSZoAkaa	well my bf is aquarius. hes one of the most caring persons you'll ever meet.he as an excellent sense of humor. he also remembers everything. but hes very close minded. if he thinks in his mind he's right theres not anything that can change that. he also very emotional and he has trust issues. he doesnt open up to alot of people.|`|de25107f3b25bf271852feb4203decd7aa	Well the ones are know are of extreme variety. I know some that are very detached from life emotionally. He was my best friend the last half of 7th grade. He's really a genuine good guy but I question him sometimes because he never shows emotion!! He's always positive and whatnot but never really shows it. He never gets mad or shows that he is angry- he never gets sad or shows that either. It's like sometimes it's weird! <br>  <br>  And this other aquarises I know. She is very self-centered! No offense! She really is. She's one of those girls you see in movies where she is the most popular and head cheerleader (shes a cheerleader). She has a good heart and we DO get along but her ways are very wrong sometimes. She's always checking herself out in the mirror and stuff and talking about herself. She has a very sharp tongue if provoked. She's quick with a comeback and cusses like a sailor when she's angry. But she doesn't show anger. <br>  <br>  This other aquarises I know...He's one of my good guy friends this year and he's pretty cool. He's very funny. But he puts up a front. He acts like a total gangster even though he's the farthest thing from it. I don't know why he does that. He flirts with the ladies a bit too much. He almost got in a fight with one of my girl friend's boyfriend. He punk'd out the fight and the boyfriend said he looked like he was about to cry or something. I was like what? Are we talking about the same guy here??|`|to6JW3yFaa	Hmm well my bf is VERY independent and tries to be emotionally detached from all of his friends because he's afraid of getting too comfortable and then getting hurt. Too bad though cause he dropped his detached mask with me so it's too late haha ;)<br>  <br>  They also like to have their alone time once in a while. Sometimes they'll disappearr for days or weeks to recharge from their friends. (Nothing personal they just want to be alone). But my guy likes to have 2-3 hrs by himself every day to listen to music, do his hobbies, and just think to himself. It's not that he doesn't care about others, some people just don't have a need to be around people 24/7. They can have fun by themselves.<br>  <br>  He also always loves to debate about issues because of the need for intellectual stimulation. Talk about something weird and different and he'll be hooked. They love to debate their issues and you'll be surprised how passionate they are in what they believe in. And he's also verrrry stubborn. You cant change his mind on anything unless you have a very logical and clear argument.<br>  <br>  Oh and of course... commitment phobe and emotion phobe. We alllll know this haha. They hate to be pushed to get farther in a relationship so u have to go with their flow otherwise ur not gonna go anywhere. And they hate to show their emotions. But once they trust u and are more comfortable, they'll let their guard down.<br>  <br>  They also hate saying that lovey dovey stuff. My guy even had the hardest time saying "I miss you." Even after not seeing me for over a month he never said it... even after I said it! Haha the silence was horrible lol lol. But once he said it and realized it wasnt the end of the world he began to say it more and more.<br>  <br>  Basically they're just a really intelligent, independent, emotionally detached, stubborn, loyal, and friendly sign.|`|AA12215623	the ones I know are mellow, good sense of humor always makin us laugh, loyal, strong people with good hearts. My best friend of over 10 years is an Aquarius and she is so goofy makin me laugh all the time yet one of the strongest people I know.|`|VAHxoStlaa	We value our freedom,independent,detached,and and love abstract and different things.

My brother and I don't talk anymore, but when we did, we had sooo much in common it was scary, but we had our differences to. I realize that everytime I talk to another aquarius I always learn someting interesting or new, and I can talk to them literally for hours and never get bored or tired. They're really good at communication, they make gr8 friends, and although unique in there own awsome quirky way we all have more in common with each other than I think we realize. I think that in 1,000 years we'll all live in space colonies because the earth will be baren, void, and dry and we'll be like the people in Gundam Seed, and Gundam Seed Destiny, and Gundam 00, only if we resolve our differences now much, much more peacefully.|`|RlrthRrbaa	They're kind of laid back, they don't talk terribly much but they smile this close-lipped grin...<br>  <br>  A little spacey, a little weird, listens to music A LOT. <br>  <br>  Dresses a little sloppy, casual. They're peaceful and fun. <br>  <br>  (That's Jean and Jae in a nutshell, lol)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! ;)|`|ORcYXbvsaa	um i dont really beleive in horoscopes but i am bored so i will answer cause my sis is aquarius<br>  <br>  creative, MAJOR mood swings...

39a80d0f5ce15f073f624db93d68ca04aa	actually we are not made from the earth. its believed that the atoms in the human body comes from the core of a star that died billions of years ago. earth too is made of elements that are all the result of a star burning hydrogen at different temperatures and causing a nucleus to either lose or gain electrons and as a result form a different atomic bonding and therefore appear and behave differently. so if you think about it, fire is the thing from which everything in existence comes from, apart from hydrogen of course.<br>  <br>  now to answer your question, the elements in astrology are to do with the human behavior. e.g. a fire sign is hard to pin down and are energetic, a water sign is emotional etc.. but all these are more like religious or philosophical ideas than scientific facts therefore they are subject to criticism. if you don't feel like a fire you can be water. because astrology uses a lot of astronomy, they want to make it as scientific as they possibly can because science is widely accepted as logic but without losing the spiritual touch.|`|q3KCDrMAaa	Basically... The earth is what we are made from. We are made up of the same energy and fundamental elements of the earth. The elements of fire, water, and air are of the Earth as well. The connection is supposed to draw us together. This connection makes up the emotional, philosophical side of astrology.|`|HZxX9ke8aa	concept came from ancient greek philosophers like thales, see this;<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_element" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_e...</a><br>  <br>  or rather jump to this;<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_element#Classical_elements_in_Greece" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_e...</a>

4DNOpxN4aa	Maby its not really YOUR leg. It could have been switched with a 40 year old dope smokin, video junkie who lives in his moms basement and lives on twinkies... Could happen ya know lol.|`|SoTQ4bmVaa	cause you vains are all joint toghether  ps best answer|`|R7x0qIqyaa	Because it's tired.|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	It's because you're probably compressing your leg nerves and impairing blood circulation to your legs. Either you're sitting too much, or crossing your legs in a wierd way, or wearing tight clothes. In any case, you're somehow pinching your nerves and/or cutting off blood flow to your legs, which causes your leg to "fall asleep". Just stand up and move around occasionally to prevent it or to get rid of the sensation.|`|Orx9cTJJaa	It gets sleepy. :)|`|v7HC2MGXaa	i just hate it when you try to walk and you cant!!|`|nkmwGAKjaa	Interruption of the circulation to the lower extremity!|`|tc5vrfuiaa	Its tired|`|AdEJBAkMaa	Many people say this is because you've cut off the blood supply to your foot, but your nerves are more to blame. Nerves are like tiny threads or wires that run through your whole body, and they carry messages back and forth between your brain and body.<br>  <br>  When you sit on your foot, you temporarily compress, or squash, the nerves in that area. These nerves can't send messages back to the brain normally, and so for the moment, the connection is cut off and you don't feel anything. It's kind of like a phone call where your friend hangs up and you haven't yet: Your brain is saying "hello," but your foot isn't able to answer.|`|xPXUzZiJaa	cuz like its tired and stuff, nah, but if you keep it there in the same spot, it sleeps, its used to walking and running and stuff, so if you keep it still, it falls asleep, yawn yawn|`|f14e7634a2f2cb52ab80310b78f8411caa	The nerves in your limbs are compressed, and they become cut off from communication with your brain (interrupted flow). Once you start to move them, they 'reconnect' or begin to flow again, causing a tingling sensation.|`|A2Ne8sdFaa	i wanna know that too!|`|YW1DXceqaa	blood circulation being cut off due to pressure on the veins or blood flow in one direction leading up to "to much" blood in one area which is associated with nerve endings|`|bFfdbWk2aa	i don't probably when you stay still for to long|`|P8uh4joQaa	maybe it's tired?<br>  <br>  <br>  real answer: poor circulation|`|AlocuXIFaa	Because it's bored.|`|0VbAMZccaa	you have resting leg syndrome|`|y5FfKGAsaa	Because your circulation of blood slows down, I think.<br>  xD|`|IzPCsjXoaa	coz its tyered after walking round all those clothes shops ha ha|`|Wuo6qYQMaa	When you site in a certain position, it restricts blood flow to your leg (doesn't STOP it though) so your nerves don't get what they need, and basically...the nerve endings dying is why your leg goes numb.|`|lfJ5Jxxwaa	Your dog humped it too much?|`|G7OwyyHPaa	Vanessa C: the equation is already balanced.<br>  <br>  and it's because there's no blood flow to your leg.|`|Oa4QZGXSaa	its tired of you|`|SDKwVtuMaa	because it has no brains|`|hB7no5bPaa	Because while you're asleep, it's out partying so when you're up, it's pretty damn tired.|`|uEDWyaRmaa	because you don't use it so blood doesn't need to be circulated, so it's cut off, and it falls asleep|`|QLOCznKTaa	Because your blood circulation is being cut off in your leg because your putting pressure on it..........duh lol|`|ahXIBlstaa	I always thought it had to do with cutting off blood supply & nerves.|`|AX6DXGodaa	i think its something to do with the circulation in ur legs being cut off, which makes them feel tingly.|`|pC1H7kO4aa	You're laying/sitting on it weird, so the blood circulation is slowed.|`|MZxv6z9qaa	Many people say this is because you've cut off the blood supply to your foot, but your nerves are more to blame.

It's kind of like a phone call where your friend hangs up and you haven't yet: Your brain is saying "hello," but your foot isn't able to answer.|`|uSW53DKAaa	The pressure you put on your nerves disables information to be carried to your brain. When you release this pressure, all the information goes at once and your brain can't process it all. You know how a TV has static? That's what your brain is like when this happens. That's what the pins and needles are. Slowly, all the sensory information gets sorted, and the feeling comes back. <br>  <br>  People say it's cutting off the blood flow, and while that is true, it isn't the whole story. It's all about your nerves.|`|Uagg9UsFaa	It falls asleep when you are sitting on it or have a lot of weight on it and then when you start to move it around again, the blood starts to flow easier in that part and it creates a kind of tingly feeling, like there are beads in your foot or something.|`|maiL8VsNaa	well, it is all bc of your blood flow. when you cut it off it gets bored. so it tends to fall alseep every now and then to show you that u need to  shake it off. But another reason is that your nerves get pinched and you can hurt them pretty badly. but all you need to do is shake it off and rub it. it rlly does help.|`|joMU7LVIaa	because it does|`|3Tr0EJzlaa	when you bend your leg you pinch the blood vessels so the blood cant get to your leg.  and don't forget your nerves but somebody already said something about the nerves.|`|Wd8NMstXaa	The you cut off your blood follow.  hehehe numbness is always fun|`|JrhUteBgaa	idk. i have like an F in health so......|`|df803ac845624e37559acc061d7d047aaa	Because your vein becomes constricted and it cannot pump the needed blood through your leg. Your leg starts to loose blood so it starts to loose feeling.|`|wj5YVqroaa	cause your not getting circulation of blood to where the part of your body is "falling asleep"|`|vn1kDCTTaa	lol coz its tired|`|t4DP30r6aa	Lack of circulation to your leg..

This can happen if you cross your legs. It gives you a tingly feeling when there is no blood flow. :) I kinda like it.|`|G9Cz9Wlmaa	when you are in a certain position, where the veins are pushed together the blood flow slows down.  this make your nerves react in that manner.|`|Rx8U8eVnaa	When blood flow stops or reduces.

tGAt3ZKkaa	I have so many.<br>  So get reay to laugh and just read for ages, lol.<br>  <br>  1) It was my first camp in grade 2.<br>  I was taking a shower and the fire alarm went off, everyone ran out and a teacher slammed my door open and pulled me out without a towel!!<br>  So there I was, standing butt naked infront of 2 classes of boys and girls!! OMG!!<br>  <br>  2) It was my last years camp, i woke up in the middle of the night to find my friends laughing and taping me on their phones.<br>  One of them showed me the vid and to my horror in the vid I was humming and sort of dancing to the tune of mary had a little lamb in my sleep!!!<br>  <br>  3) It was friday the 13th 2007 and it was 12:00AM. My parents said me and 2 of my friends could stay outside late just dont go anywhere.<br>  So we were outside playing truth dare.<br>  I was dared ti streak in my front yard (thats where we were) I finaly gave in and started to streak around. When a few HOT boys from my class came past on their bikes!! I ran and hid behind a tree.<br>  My friends tried to lie my way out of it when I saw a massive spider on the tree infront of me (i am terrfied of spiders) i ran out from behind the tree screaming and the boys were laughing their butts off and taking pix!!!<br>  Then i suddenly saw my neighbors go to their windows and all the lights came on!<br>  <br>  Now everyone has seen me naked! GREAT!!<br>  <br>  4) It was a fire drill at school but I was in the bathroom at the time so I thought it was real.<br>  I looked around and didn't see anyone, I ran downstairs into the basment floor of my school talking to myself "omg, i'm gonna die! please someone!" when I suddenly heard laugter and saw all the classes lined up at their doors.<br>  SOO embarrassing!<br>  <br>  I have much more but to much to list|`|84fm2GXOaa	when i was in mexico i had horrific diarrhea, and i HAD to go, so i darted into a really old restaurant and completely destroyed the pluming, <br>  anyway poo started flying back out the toilet and i just left, well more like ran out of the restaurant...<br>  <br>  also when i was younger i fell asleep druing catholic mass, my friend tried to wake me up but my head hit the pue infront of me and i shouted "MOTHERF***ER!!!" right as everyone was about to pray ..... >>>>.<<<<|`|n5u3rkV4aa	hehehehhehe i am not ashamed it was hilarious.

It felt good to have all the guys looking at you, I guess it was kind of $L.u.t.t.y, but whatever.<br>  <br>  So we play lacross in gym and I'm on a team with some of the hottest guys in the school. I just hang out in net and do nothing, I'm not really one for participating in gym. So the other team gets a hold of the ball, one of them comes right up to me, and they fling it as hard as they possibly can towards the net. I spread my legs so the ball could go through (I didnt want it to hit me), and it comes in direct contact with my poor unprotected crotch.<br>  <br>  I fell over immediately clutching my crotch for so long, rolling from side to side. I didnt know it would hurt that much; the guys looked surprised. I was limping around for the rest of the day, feeling very humbled. I was soo embarrased.|`|OX6FXzICaa	Ha, one time i was walking with a guy I liked and tripped and fell into a recycling bin and couldn't get out. -_-' kinda sucked then but i just laughed it off.|`|AlocuXIFaa	I was spotted doing a good deed. Never Again !!!|`|65637be5b6e62fe9ddf9ceed6a13d85daa	April 07.<br>  Had received a kidney transplant. One of the "side affects" of a transplant, is the male anatomy swelling. I had so much swelling, that I could not waer any underpants. So for 4 days I had to wear a wonderful hospital gown, with no underwear. Every person that came in would see me "hanging out." Really embarrasing. Yes I could of covered myself, with my sheets, but a side effect of one of my transplant meds, is to always feel hot.<br>  Kind of a "catch 22."|`|LcEY08kAaa	i was at my friends cottage and i kinda have a crush on her older brother...<br>  we were playing truth or dare and they dared me to run to the beach and back completly naked.  So i took off my clothes, bra and underwear included, and ran.  <br>  I got back and my friends had locked the door.  I started bangind on the door, her brother came out wondering what was going on.  <br>  I totally forgot i was naked and just let my arms hang to my sides.<br>  He did say nice boobs, which made me happy, i turned around to cover up, and he slapped my naked ***!!! :D:D:D:D:D YAY!<br>  so my older crush saw me naked and comented on my body!<br>   defintly the most embarressing thing EVER!
XoNuUrYoaa	Both the Amish and Mennonites are Anabaptists, however the Amish emerged from the Mennonites for not being strict enough regarding shunning outsiders and those who disobey church rules.<br>  <br>  The Amish are much stricter about shunning and about general day-to-day rules, such as hat brim thickness, house blind colours, no pattern on clothes and so on.The Old Order Mennonites and Old Order Amish are very similar expect the OOM women wear patterned  clothes, the OOM wear black hats unlike the Amish men who all wear straw hats and the OOM permit bicycles while the OOA permit only scooters. <br>  <br>  The Conservative Mennonites are quite liberal, using electricity, cars, the Internet and phones and in between them and the OOM, there are Mennonites who use the horse and buggy and dress & live like the OOM expect the use electricity in their homes.<br>  <br>  Both groups will move if their area becomes too crowded and too expensive to expand farm land- or if too many tourists visit.|`|Y4Ye3OLOaa	Basically Mennonites are more open to modern conveniences and sometimes dress a lot differently than Amish. I live near Holmes County, OH which is actually the biggest concentration of Amish in the country. They really aren't that bad, they're nice people when you talk to them.

NY4ectQcaa	Dude--I'm going to tell you this right now. DON'T BUY THE "COMPLETE BOX SET"! I did that, and the set was essentially junk. The resolution was crap, and Disney or ABC banners were going across the screen every three seconds. It's illegal by the way too. Lionsgate bought up the rights in August 2008, so now it is up to them to put seasons 4 through 7 on DVD. Bear with me, okay? You can still get the first three seasons at fairly reasonable prices.

I attached it. they even said on tmz and the news that she did throw the keys out the window. that was a fact. so, if she gave him herpes, why would she throw out the keys? she didnt give him herpes. she was trying to help him, and he was drunk. and he beat dat up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|t1QtLK4oaa	I think he is but I don't think that is a woman beater.

ZyGyDLsDaa	Mikey (1992)<br>  starring Brian Bonsall, Josie Bissett, Ashley Laurence, John Diehl, Lyman Ward<br>  IMDb review: ***SPOILERS***<br>  Mikey (Brian Bonsall of "Family Ties" and "Star Trek: The Next Generation") is a little boy who lives with foster parents and ends up killing them. He causes his foster sister to drown in a pool, electrocutes his mother and hits his father with a baseball bat. Mikey tells the police a stranger murdered the family. Why would they doubt a little boy? Mikey is placed in another home. His teacher (Ashley Laurence of "Hellraiser" 1, 2, 3, and 6) notices something strange about his drawings, but the principal  (Lyman Ward of "Ferris Bueller's Day Off") doesn't think that it's a big deal. Mikey has a crush on an older girl (Josie Bissett) who can tell there is something terribly wrong with this child. Then, something happens to spark another killing spree by the 9-year-old terror!<br>  <br>  Here's the movie trailer, which features several scenes you describe, including the pool, the hairdryer and marbles:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQTWFb7kVSI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQTWFb7kV...</a>

5zwcnmOIaa	my fvorite was one x.<br>  <br>  early march 2009
Jv1dMGuWaa	1) Tokio Hotel. They are a German band, but they have done English versions of most of their songs. I think the German version are much more powerful, because they did it when they were very young. Some of the songs are Scream, Forgotten Children, and the most popular Ready Set Go. The genre is supposed to be 'emotional rock'.<br>  <br>  2)Kill Hannah. Don't mind the name, this isn't a death metal band or anything. It is actually rather slow rock. The music Kill Hannah comes out with always is beautiful, and most of them remind me of the war. One of my favourite songs from them is Agent Orange Skies, which is, coincidently, the name of the gas the armies use in the rainforest to clear out the plants. It is a very emotional, and very different band.<br>  <br>  3) 30 Seconds To Mars. Some of their songs may be a little bit hard, but songs like From Yesterday, Modern Myth, and Beautiful Lit are very beautiful with great lyrics. They are also listed as emotional rock. The songs Battle Of One and The Kill may be a little hard for you though.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped, <br>  Rainbow-RoXas|`|Jx0MarUmaa	Further Seems Forever are worth a look. Very good band although from their 3 albums they had 3 different singers, Id suggest Hide Nothing.

All from the album meteora.I'm not sure if they r christian though (they have a bit of swearing in some songs)  Hope I helped.

ZyGyDLsDaa	Love and Other Disasters (2006)<br>  IMDb synopsis:<br>  Emily Jackson (Brittany Murphy) lives a fast-paced life. Always on the go, able to talk around the clock, with a sensitive soul she loves playing matchmaker for her friends. It's Emily's gay roommate and frequent companion Peter (Matthew Rhys), who becomes again the subject matchmaking skills when handsome new photographer assistant Paolo (Santiago Cabrera) arrives at the Vogue offices, where Emily works. She makes it her mission to bring the two men together. Unfortunately for her, she is so busy arranging a love connection between Peter and Paolo that she remains completely blind to the one suitor who longs to provide her with the loving companionship that she so cheerfully arranges for others~Paolo.<br>  <br>  Good Advice (2001)<br>  IMDb synopsis:<br>  Ryan (Charlie Sheen) is a womanizing stockbroker whose unethical business practices cost him his job and his trader's license. Unable to find another job, he is forced to move in with his equally self-involved and completely oblivious girlfriend, Cindy (Denise Richards), an insensitive advice columnist on the cusp of losing her own job due to her poor advice and slow work habits. Finding that the truth behind his moving in has nothing to do with romance, Cindy runs off with another man. Ryan decides to stay in the apartment and earn a living by doing Cindy's job.

There really is no modern day equivalent to him because "the times they have a changed" so much (ha ha).  You have to really understand the way the culture and things were back in the 60's to appreciate what he caused and why he was so iconic.  We (the country) were in the midst of a war that Dylan's generation despised, and the whole "hippie" anti-establishment, civil rights movement, and "turn on - and tune out" thing was just getting started.  Free love, doing your own thing (with no rules or limits), getting "stoned," and revolting against anything that was "normal" or established was the cool thing to do.  Dylan epitomized a whole generation of late teen and twenty somethings that had no idea what was going to happen next to the world (and didn't care), or if they were even going to be alive tomorrow.  It was a world and a generation that desperately needed something or someone and Dylan filled the gap well.  You have to remember we had just went through the 50's and rock and roll was a fairly new thing, and the grown-ups and adults of that era were uptight and prude and hated everything the 60's stood for like peace, and love, etc... (imagine the parents from old Leave it to Beaver show and you'll see what most grown-ups were like back then).  I agree that Dylan really didnt have an amazing vocal range, but during the 60's (when there was no internet, cable, or satellite tv)- he provided something that just hit at the right time- not a culture... but a counterculture.  He was truly amazing and there can never be anyone or anything like him again.

AA11719394	Hey there, this i believe is a song about not knowing what can happen and what difference you made in your life.<br>  <br>  The song talks about 4 people who are traveling on a bus, a teacher a farmer, a preacher and a hooker. The bus meets with an accident and 3 die but one of them survives (the hooker) however before dying the preacher gives the hooker a bible and talks to her about Christ. The story is told by the Hookers son who has now become a preacher and is telling the story of how there are just 3 crosses instead of 4 and how his mother (the hooker) survived that night but changed her life because she met the preacher before the accident.<br>  <br>  Hope i've made sense :)|`|zVlZTGCqaa	It's the story of 4 people in a car accident. The farmer, the teacher, and the preacher died, but the hooker lived. As the preacher was dying, he gave his bible to the hooker. She later read it to her son, who became a preacher himself, and told the story to his congregation. There are only 3 crosses because the farmer, teacher, and preacher had already made an impact on others, and were therefore alive in the minds of others. God saved the hooker so she could go on and change someone else's life too. The moral is that when you die, it's the impact you have on other people and what you leave behind that is most important.

It was sooooo embaressing.|`|iWLdlWthaa	Last year (grade 9) for the first good day of spring I worse these incredibly tight jean shorts. It felt good to have all the guys looking at you, I guess it was kind of $L.u.t.t.y, but whatever.<br>  <br>  So we play lacross in gym and I'm on a team with some of the hottest guys in the school. I just hang out in net and do nothing, I'm not really one for participating in gym. So the other team gets a hold of the ball, one of them comes right up to me, and they fling it as hard as they possibly can towards the net. I spread my legs so the ball could go through (I didnt want it to hit me), and it comes in direct contact with my poor unprotected crotch.<br>  <br>  I fell over immediately clutching my crotch for so long, rolling from side to side. I didnt know it would hurt that much; the guys looked surprised. I was limping around for the rest of the day, feeling very humbled. I was soo embarrased.|`|EcGbEvqJaa	I was round my friends house and i sat in dog crap! Then her mum wiped it off me!

I pull a lot of senseless pranks, but I've done a few nice ones.<br>  <br>  convincing my step mother (a genuinely horrible person, if I might add) it was a work day.

I even took the trash down early and had a friend pick it up.<br>  <br>  she's always the first one to work, so there is usually no one there. The whole office had to take off for a week, and I got her to go to work on Monday. She got up on Monday, thought she was late because I messed with her alarm clock, hurried to leave in time for work (so she wasn't paying attention). I had fixed her car radio not to come on (she electronically impaired, lol) and she went to work. She unlocked the doors, the alarm went off, and the cops picked her up for breaking and entering because it clearly said on the door CLOSED BETWEEN - 6-7-08 & 6-13-08!

All depends how you depict the final chat between Shaun and his Mum. All she say's is that Milky is going to be OK.<br>  <br>  This can be taken in two ways. The first, obvious, that he is stable and will come round from his injuries. The other is that he is dead. If you remember Shaun was looking at a picture of his Dad which could suggest that Milky is OK because he is with Shaun's Dad.<br>  <br>  Either way I think the film was portraying the fact that he was severely beaten in the first place. Whether he died or not is not the point, its the completely inadmissible behaviour of Combo which should be questioned.|`|6eacd57b79b464060c76ec12a4608de8aa	No, he doesnt, he actually died.|`|xKY5TjOlaa	Dont know|`|aY6EjDwjaa	yarp<br>  he goes to hospital<br>  they say it in the ne.xt scene|`|JafMj9LVaa	Yes, i think he does.

And because teenagers aren't mature enough to bring up a child. And I don't mean to be rude by that, I'm a teenager myself.|`|AA11523465	Just because your body is ready to reproduce, doesn't mean you're emotionally or financially ready.|`|cJYAhLFCaa	teenagers are just not equipped to be parents.|`|TXaMOQo6aa	cuz teenagers have to go to school and they have to leave their baby home alone.|`|BSBBLZSzaa	Timing. Teenagers have a lot of things on their mind and raising children shouldn't be one of them. They should graduate highschool, go to college and ENJOY their freedom. <br>  <br>  Having babies is a HUGE responsibility. Being a mother, you have to devote most of your time to caring for your newborn. Teenagers should be out going to the movies, doing homework and talking on the phone not having children. <br>  <br>  Becoming a parent is a wonderful experience but I don't adivse it unless you are mature, responsible and can afford to take care of a child.|`|3997325147149f0d06953ea74c4ec810aa	It technically isn't "bad," of course. Babies are wonderful. Still, parenthood robs teenagers of their extended childhoods, their opportunities in school and careers, and of their dependent status. I don't look down on teen parents, but I do sympathize.<br>  <br>  Regardless of this, I still think that my underage cousins' children are some of the most beautiful kids on the planet. After all, if prevention didn't work, neither will regret.|`|wLkNfc2xaa	They have all on looking after themselfs never mind a baby. They are not responsable, mature or old enough.|`|gDryAvpJaa	They would be committing adultery too early for their age. Plus, they need education, and more life experience before undertaking a baby. And babies mean stress. You'd have too deal with stress, sex, etc. And homework! So, come on, teens should give themselves a little more time in between. Also, it is very unhealthy, because your body is not fully prepared.|`|lbWClQkyaa	because it will ruin there lives forever. <br>  for example, if you were pregnant, you wouldn't be able to finish your education and therefore you wont be able to go to a good college and then you cant have a very good job<br>  also, people will lose respect for you and that will ruin your social image.<br>  lastly, taking care of a baby is a really big thing. some people make it look easy but its really hard, especially when your a teenager|`|9bd9414381f10bcdaf459fbf92925724aa	They need to finish school and some teenagers are probably not even mature enough to even take care of one. Then they mess up there whole life in the long run by either having money problems or they won't get to do what they wanted to do there whole life because they have a child on there hand.|`|HiAZ4Mriaa	yes because it sets bad examples for other teens and they lose the next eighteen years of their lives.  Having babies is very hard and very trying on your patience.  It's even hard for me and I have a four year old and a 4 month old at 26.  It's best to wait until marriage or at least your mid to late 20's until you decide to have a baby.|`|5uAaJfaaaa	im a teenager and i think that its bad because i would rather finish my education and get good GCSE's and get a good job. Also i would rather find someone im going to be with for a long time and settle down with him and that. At a young age you dont know if there right for you and also you dont really have enough money to bring the child up|`|wlVqU2EBaa	because they are not responsible enough to take care of another life!! they have their own to worry about....|`|9f06f93b066c7a2add024105115b5117aa	because they need an education and marketable skills to suport a baby ! its not fair to have babies u cant suport if your in that place mabe u should call a lawyer about adoption its better to let some one eles adopt your child then not be aboe to give it things it needs !|`|SlR0Cp5saa	Because they don't realize how much work goes into raising a child. They probably didn't even mean for it to happen anyways and now they have the human child they have to take care of. Teens just aren't responsible enough and they usually don't have the time.|`|tjBkNe9Jaa	cuz they miss up in all the fun it is 2 be a teenager. and when people get older they become grumpy|`|ATpKrr2Oaa	some teens can rise to the occasion and have babies and raise them well, others are self centered and not able to handle the very real responsibility of parenting.   i don't think it is fair to generalize such an issue.|`|Q7d1Fo1daa	My woman was 19 when we had our first, so technically, she was still a teenager. I was 24. I think as long as one of the parents is at least SOMEWHAT financially stable, then it's all good. Most teenagers are chronically broke, though...|`|v86sOx7Gaa	Because they're still kids themselves. They need to have somewhat of an education and have fun being a kid before they take on the responsibility of raising a life in this world.|`|umUiScliaa	I think because it takes up alot of time and will make the teens very stresssed out and not be able to focus on there school work.|`|5gnlVmMzaa	?because they can't move forward with their life they have to put the baby first they can't do things they want to do?

I like the wind in my hair, the wide open spaces! How can such beauty be unknown to the common world? My favorite word of all time is, "Play." the four most wonderous letters in the alphabet into one word that speaks numerous joys out to the crys of youth and childhood. Oh, did i mention my names Hildegard Alexandra Robusk? I was voted most likely to die alone in the year 2008. And let me just say, I have not died. And I... am alone. I am the complete OPPOSITE of the word platitudinous. I've had a crush on Bill Nye ever since I first saw him on my 2nd grade video. I wish to marry that young lad. I have 4 cats, all named after my grand ancestors. One named Bertha, Jilusephit, Gredle, and Sniffles. Sniffles was my great great great great great grandma and since they couldn't speak fluent sentences, her name was Sniffles.<br>  Ive recently painted all the walls in my house gray, to match my exuberant personality!<br>  And in conclusion- that is what this song is about.<br>  The name of it is what YOU think it is. <br>  For me- its name is Old cat woman finds a pal|`|bIKkPzRFaa	"So Much In Love" by All-4-One?|`|nxuPFxNcaa	your lyrics are off a lil bit, but that song is "so much love" by all-4-one ... tht song is alright but they suck. no offense to your taste in tunes but yeah ...

qLBU4t9Zaa	There are plenty of people with larger noses that are very successful-why should that stop them from trying? If you feel that badly about it think of it this way-you've been blessed with a talent, smile about it.  Don't halt your dreams because you don't think you reach them.  You can always reach them.|`|mjfFuvgWaa	hey- watch cyrano, it's a movie in french about a man famed for his large nose, but it's happy in the end.|`|Nyc2WH9Baa	1) wear makeup that highlights your good parts, not your nose<br>  <br>  2) get an attention-grabbing hairdo, that will draw attention to your hair, instead of your nose<br>  <br>  3) wear clothes that bring attention to your style, so people will focus on that<br>  <br>  4) BE CONFIDENT! lots of people have big noses, its ok! good luck!|`|4NpxncSGaa	The nose and your looks aren't as important as your shyness. Work on making your presence and personality BIG and BOLD, and nobody will pay attention to the nose.|`|NsiIVymtaa	its called a nose job!|`|3FWEOGZmaa	I used to feel the same way about my nose, but I've grown to realize it makes me who I am. If you truly feel like you need to physical alterate your appearence, the go for it. Don't think about everyone else's opinion about you, if YOU feel it will help YOU feel better about YOURSELF, then by all means...look into plastic surgery.<br>  <br>  However, if you don't necessarily have to go to the extremes. If you have genuine talent, OF COURSE you can make in the business! Although I may sound like a broken record right now, repeating the obvious...all it takes is HARD WORK, and you can achieve whatever you want. Take a look at Hollywood stars today, there are plenty actors that have their imperfections! Keep your head up, you got the talent.

You boys have these delightfully silly parts just dangling there between your legs - you can't blame us for wanting to give them a whack and see what happens.  Especially when you boys misbehave and need a bit of quick discipline.  Personally I think giving a boy a good testicular thumping is empowering, extremely funny, and good stress relief.  And believe me, there's nothing secret about it - I've kneed and squeezed my boyfriend's goodies more times than I can count.

lijNJznEaa	I think they're both crap.<br>  They also sound the f******g same!!|`|CrAwmz65aa	>>>>>The above answers are correct in that Bach was more contrapuntal.  That is why he was more prolific in composing fugues.  A notable, although rare, fugue by Mozart is found in the last movement of his Jupiter Symphony.<br>  <br>  Mozart often accompanied his melodies with an Alberti bass.  The Alberti bass is named after Domenico Alberti, a composer who lived in Bach's time, but Bach chose not to use it.<br>  <br>  >>>>>The orchestra was expanding in Mozart's time.  It was no longer so common to compose for string orchestra only.  A notable exception is Eine Kleine Nachtmusik.<br>  <br>  >>>>>Musical form was being revised.  Although a few of Bach's preludes show some semblance of the ternary form, or ABA form, in utero, it never really existed until Mozart's time.<br>  <br>  The rondo form, as we now know it, also came into existence in Mozart's time.  The most common rondo forms were ABACA or ABACABA, with the B and C themes in related keys.  In Bach's time, all of the themes were in the same key, with only the A theme restated.  A well-known example is the Gavotte en Rondeau from the E major partita for unaccompanied violin.<br>  <br>  The minuet form was expanded to include a trio.<br>  <br>  Mozart was one of the masters of the sonata-allegro form, which did not exist in Bach's time.  <br>  <br>  As previously mentioned, the fugue went passe.  So did the prelude--at least until revived by Chopin and Rachmaninoff.<br>  <br>  >>>>>Someone--apparently someone with a lot of patience--tallied up Bach's compositions in major and minor keys and found them to be about half and half.  The composers of Mozart's time, however, tended to shy away from minor modality.  When Mozart did compose in a minor key, it was sometimes during an unhappy time in his life.  Mozart wrote his a minor piano sonata right after his mother died.  He also wrote his g minor symphony when he was having financial problems.|`|ad4ac1203a5f72a5c427680e06c5d512aa	They are vastly different. Most of Bach's music was composed in an era of Aristocracy and Church. Mozart, on the other hand lived during the age of "Enlightenment" where people began asking questions about everything like science, math, and social issues. Mozart (and others during his time) were composing music in a new form. Bach composed "Fugues" where you have 3 or more voices moving horizontally and each has equal importance. Mozart (and his contemporaries) were experimenting with new things. The Fugue was considered old hat in his time although Mozart had great respect for Bach. If you listen to their music one after the other you would see that Bach is "Stuffed Shirt" but Mozart is free and more inventive with his harmonies. Bach was strict and adhered to voice leading rules of his time.|`|qswrz268aa	Vast differences. Bach is baroque, Mozart is Classical. Bach has much contrapuntal focuses. A fugue is counterpoint, a voice being relayed over its self and variations of itself. Mozart for the most part had a more focus on melody, and then accompaniment, whereas Bach's accompaniment was often the melody itself. Playfulness... Both can be quite playful, like a quaint fugue, or a minuet. About the runs, Mozart used lots of "flowery" run type figures, in piano anyway. You have to understand anyway, Bach composed on the harpsichord, Mozart, piano, early piano anyway. Bach can have just as many notes as Mozart, much more in fact...<br>  <br>  I cannot stress how idiot and ignorant and dreadful the answer above me is... My gosh! Some people!|`|CeMP7HMYaa	Well Bach's music was during the Baroque period in music while Mozart was in the classical period.  Also, during Bach's time, there were not as many different kinds of instruments as Mozart's time

c163fa51e120c7272cf81810aea3691eaa	I think you may be confused, Naruto has never been Hokage, not even in Shippudden. Shippudden actually deals with Naruto being only a few years older, having better skills, the story plots and characters are also more mature than the regular, naruto show where he is younger. It is really good though!<br>  <br>  Here is a site where you can watch older Naruto: Shippudden episodes, from 1 to 90. You need to download bittorrent though, because it is a torrent site.

gCV01F5Qaa	I personally loved the twilight saga! Stephenie meyer did a great job! U can't compare the Host to it... they are both unique... but yeah in twilight u have vampires and werewolfs, on the other hand u have "The Host" that is science fiction, it follows the story of Melanie Stryder and Wanderer, a young woman and an invading alien "soul," who are forced to work as one. So basicly u have aliens on planet Earth...! For me at first, it was hard to get in the story... but as soon as i was in i completely fell in love with it! It's worth it for real! <br>  <br>  Still about Steph, and the twilight saga, i dunno if u herd that Steph is/was working on "Midnight Sun" which basically retells the events of Twilight, but from Edward's perspective. There was an online leak of a rough draft of its first 12 chapters, unfortunatly because of this Steph chose to delay the project indefinitely... yet and fortunatly for us she made the rough chapters of "Midnight Sun" available on her website. Check it out, it's great!  <a href="http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/midnightsun.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/midnightsu...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  About other books u might like, these are some of my favorites, under them i leave u the author's website where u can find the first chapters... ok here goes:<br>  #Christopher Paolini<br>  -Eragon<br>  -Eldest<br>  -Brising<br>  <br>  #Carol Berg<br>  -Song of the Beast<br>  @The Bridge of D'Arnath<br>  -Son of Avonar<br>  -Guardians of the Keep<br>  -The Soul Weaver<br>  -Daughter of Ancients<br>  @The Books of the Rai-kirah<br>  -Transformation<br>  -Revelation<br>  -Restoration <br>  <a href="http://www.sff.net/people/carolberg/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sff.net/people/carolberg/</a><br>  <br>  #Trudi Canavan<br>  @The Black Magician trilogy<br>  -The Magicians'Guild<br>  -The Novice<br>  -The High Lord<br>  @Age of the Five<br>  -Priestess of the White<br>  -Last of the Wilds<br>  -Voice of the Gods <br>  <a href="http://www.trudicanavan.com/aboutbooks.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.trudicanavan.com/aboutbooks.p...</a><br>  <br>  #Maria V.

The third one was OK, and I found the last one to be so amazingly predictable and uncreative that I didn't even bother to finish it. (I was almost finished and I already knew what happened)  My opinion about the twilight series is different than most, but I am currently reading The Host and I think it is very good. It is a lot different than twilight, because it is a Sci-Fi. The writing is WAY better, and the story is also much better. I didn't like it at all at first, but as the story progressed I began to love it and I highly recommend it! :-)|`|CzLvqFFsaa	you will LOVE it!!!|`|lKfxk6eeaa	OMG yes! it's totally different than the Twilight Saga but it's sooo good. It's more sci fi , and I didn't think I was going to like it but it's soo original and amazing. You'll love it!  <br>  <br>   Have you read Vampire Academy by Rachelle Meade? Very good books to read, at first it starts off slow but it gets really good, trust me. There are three books currently. You might also want to look up Amanda Ashley, she has some very amazing vampire/shapeshifter you'll love em books lol.  Hope I can help.
23388793f620c611103ee18bb1db488caa	Naruto Shippuden the movie 2: Bonds has only been released in theaters in Japan. The naruto movies usually aren't subbed until they are released on dvd. So I don't think you'll be able to find it yet. But if it's like the first shippuden movie which was released in August in theaters, just like this one. It should be released in April of this year on dvd. Once it's released on dvd it will be subbed within days. So you don't have too long to wait. ^_^

It's just her and the writer of Milk so far.<br>  <br>  Milk shouldn't have won for Best Original Screenplay. Don't get me wrong, it was a great film, but it wasn't a very creative screenplay. It was practically identical to the documentary of Milk's life. I highly recommend that documentary, by the way. It deserves acting awards, it was excellently portrayed. I think Mickey Rourke deserves it over Sean Penn, but Penn was also excellent, as was the whole cast..|`|VAb2mSg0aa	Well if you're watching it now, and saw that 'Milk' for best original screenplay, you didn't miss anything.

6wBe0XTGaa	Well, from my own personal experiences in such matters, I'll tell you what I know.<br>  Firstly, if you want to be a singer, you need to audition. Even if its not in front of a Panel of judges, you still have to sing. Like if you were going to sign a label, they would make you sing first. Whomever you are trying to get to like your voice will need to hear it first. <br>  Secondly, since you are so young you should try and get into vocal lessons and mature your voice. Look into some local talent shows and such things before you try to shoot for the gold. Who knows? Maybe there would be a producer at one of those things. The famous singer Rihanna got discovered in her backyard. <br>  Thirdly, I would like to give you some advice. Since you are so young, you should really try and get into some classes before you try to get all serious. You will probably change as you grow so you need to find a genre and style that you fit in the most. Your best bet will be to perfect your voice as much as you can and then whenever you turn 16 you can try out for american idol.<br>  Good luck!!|`|JTEtWRPcaa	participate in a talent show in your  school

IS way too general.  At most, they sound like album titles.  I don't think you're going to want to label yourselves as generic or angsty.  I wouldn't include the words "Teenage" or "Rock" in any because the former limits your audience and you'll grow out of it, and the latter because it is more of a genre than a title.  However, it you made a pun out of it, it could work.

I take it you want the type where the characters gain new powers in order to defeat harder opponents. <br>  <br>  D.Gray-Man - Much like Naruto and Bleach, based around superhuman abilities and a very good show in my opinion. <br>  Although it just cuts off at episode 103.<br>  <br>  Fate/Stay Night - Very good show based around magic and a supernatural war 26 episodes long if i remember correctly.<br>  <br>  One Piece - (one of my personal favorites) Based around Pirates, Luffy being the main character, in his journey to become the pirate king. <br>  Not normal pirates of course they all have crazy abilities. <br>  390 episodes long and ongoing.<br>  <br>  If you decide to watch any of those it should take you a while.|`|lqWaiQnAaa	If you like action you might like Blood+.

Japan is now referred to as Area 11, and its people the 11's. A Britannian who was living in Japan at the time, Lelouch, vowed to his Japanese friend Suzaku that he'd destroy Britannia. Years later, Lelouch is in high school, but regularly skips out of school to go play chess and gamble on himself. One day, he stumbles on terrorists 11's who've stolen a military secret and is caught by a member of the Britannian task force sent after them, who is Suzaku. As the rest of the squad arrives, Suzaku is shot for disobeying orders, while the military secret, a young girl, gives Lelouch the power of Geass, which makes anyone obey any order. While Suzaku is secretly made the pilot of Britannia's brand new prototype Knightmare, Lancelot, Lelouch becomes the masked Zero to lead the rebellion to destroy Britannia once and for all.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to read all that, it's basically about a guy who's trying to destroy the empire with a special power granted from a girl.<br>  <br>  It's really good; you should watch it. :]|`|haJOnPFMaa	pokemon! :)|`|8yE2sYGeaa	Vision of escaflowne<br>  Black cat<br>  Burst angel<br>  Aquarion<br>  Code Geass<br>  My-HiME<br>  Samurai Champloo

KFjEkOlPaa	I play only during the day so the noise doesn't really bother people when they're trying to sleep. <br>  <br>  Does the noise itself bother your parents, or does it bother your parents that the neighbors complain? If the neighbors didn't complain, would your parents mind your drumming? If it's just the neighbors, tell them that you only play when the sun is up and to get bent if they don't like it because it's your house. <br>  <br>  I had to deal with this **** before and if you don't take a hardline stance early, you'll never be a drummer because they'll take your effort to appease them as weakness. <br>  <br>  You can insulate the garage and replace the door with an insulated garage door however it won't make it "soundproof" just muffle it a bit. It's impossible to soundproof. When I was your age I was very lucky to have a supportive dad. He just told the neighbors that he's glad that I'm drumming at home and not out on the streets doing drugs or whatever and that I only play during the daytime. When the neighbors complained he told them to **** off. When they called the cops they couldn't do anything because it's during the daylight (no noise ordinances) and on our property. <br>  <br>  Don't be scared of your neighbors. <br>  <br>  And don't "play softly" either.

However, we sometimes end up doing it without even realizing.  We've either said something too bluntly or accidentally blabbed sensitive information.  It's not uncommon for us to have foot in mouth disease on a regular basis.  When we get told what we've done, we really do feel bad.  So even if a Sag has recently embarrassed you, you can take a small amount of comfort in that fact that it probably wasn't intentional.  Although depending on the severity, that might not make much difference to how you feel.|`|vhc5GSo3aa	I'm a sag female and I can tell you absolutely, 100%...no!  Because I'm blunt and direct, sometimes I say things without thinking first.  If your feelings are really hurt you should confront your sag friend.  Otherwise, your friend probably doesn't even realize that they've embarrassed you.  As a fellow sag, I can tell you that I appreciate and admire honesty in my friends and if a friend told me that I embarrassed them and why, not only would I feel terrible and apologize, but I would do my best to not make that mistake again because I truly care about my friends.|`|FIdA3FiCaa	no, not intentionally.  they are really blunt and honest, and may not realize that their frankness can hurt someones feelings/embarrass someone.|`|R1Fc344laa	nope.|`|Fb2xM1kJaa	yes. my sister does that all the time|`|2CKWoW0iaa	The ones I know don't. In my experience I've found gemini's  like to do that.
FIdA3FiCaa	they are optimists! : ]|`|8DuQt1pTaa	Sagittarius is a confident sign because of it's ruling planet Jupiter, and also because fire signs in general are very confident and extroverted.  Extroverts get their energy and drive from external sources (i.e. other people) so of course they feel comfortable in social situations and interacting with others.  They feed off it. <br>  <br>  Some people assume the Sagittarius approach to life is naive and child-like, when it all actuality it's just very optimistic.  A Sagittarius expects to do well in sports, studies or life in general because they always expect the best. They are born believing in themselves and aiming for the stars (hence the archer symbol).  Being born under the planet of luck doesn't go astray either.  Sagittarius is a sign that is very aware of the way it is viewed by other people.  That is why you come across so many "confident" Sags.  Deep down they may be as insecure as hell, but they will never, ever let it show.  The only thing they can be clueless about is running their mouth.  It has nothing at all to do with being stuck in an immature development-stage. Some people should crack open a psych book before they press submit.|`|vhc5GSo3aa	Hi there!  I'm a sag and I can tell you why.  It's this crazy, optimistic belief that things will always work out in the end.  It also comes from having a strong sense of self and a strong intuition.  My intuition is almost never wrong so I can sense when people are dishonest, or players, or whatever.  It's also because I can always see the "big picture" of what is going on.  Hope this helps!|`|R1Fc344laa	i think theyre just happy fun loving people. theres nothing  worong with confidence, it's cockiness that causes a problem|`|Fb2xM1kJaa	maybe it's second nature to them|`|3WItFAwlaa	Sagitarrius is ruled by Jupiter.  Jupiter tends to exaggerate whatever touches.  Things and people are not always what they appear to be.|`|E2VUH8Q0aa	It's not always confidence. Sometimes it's a lack of awareness. <br>  <br>  The same thing that makes them "blunt", as you will hear hurtful behavior sometimes described. <br>  <br>  It's actually a failure to recognize the emotional impact their behaviors present to others. Most of us leave that developmental cycle in the toddler stage...ever notice how most toddlers are totally self confident when they venture out into the world? That's because they are totally self possessed and are not thinking about other people or how their own actions affect other people. <br>  <br>  This is not done out of maliciousness, and that's not to imply that all Sag Suns are that way, for the flip side of Sag energy is the Sage, the wise. <br>  But that "child-like behavior" that Sagittarius energy tends to bring to the world can have it's down side.<br>  <br>  **Some people HAVE cracked open a psych book. Sorry, I must have been too "blunt:" for you...HOW DOES IT FEEL? Remember that feeling next time you decide to be "blunt" with someone else....**|`|de25107f3b25bf271852feb4203decd7aa	I have no idea!

I walk down the hall, get the kids up, come back, shower, throw on my clothes (which I've laid out the night before), come downstairs and get the kids' milk on the table, lay out the blueberries and half-and-half for him (he's made coffee by then and is pouring the cereal), and I'm out the door by 7:00 while he and the kids are eating breakfast.  (I have to be at work early; he drives the kids to school.)  Oh yeah, I take a cereal bar and a go-cup of coffee to eat on the way.<br>  <br>  That's more than you asked.

8XT1Tvcvaa	lol, what the hell. I saw the question and came here to answer with U-N-I.<br>  <br>  I found out about them a few months ago when someone posted a link to "Beautiful Day" on here, which has become one of my favourite songs. And that Fried Chicken and Watermelon mixtape was one of the best of 2007. They're definitely among the best hip hop groups with mainstream appeal right now. Better than The Cool Kids and Kidz in the Hall to me.<br>  <br>  As for the future, I see Lupe getting a lot bigger, like T.I. and Lil Wayne status. But between the underground rappers with buzz right now, maybe B.o.B. or Kid Cudi.

May he rest in peace.|`|AA11402617	I'm not surprised and you have to wonder if he would have won had he not killed himself.  Yes, it was an accident, but who takes that much medicine just to sleep.

People do some crazy and dangerous things around big trucks, (that would include other semi's too unfortunately) and it's my responsibility to try not to run over them. But professionalism requires me to keep the road rage response under control so I have to vent some other way, usually by calling a buddy who will let me rant or  crank up the XM Radio and lose it in the music.

"3, hmmm, well when were they?" "Well, Sam, remember when you were 35 years old and you really wanted to start the business on your own and no bank would give you a loan?... Remember, one day the bank president himself came over the house and signed the loan papers, no questions asked?... Well..." "Oh, Becky, you did that for me?! I respect you even more than ever, to do such a thing for me... So when was number 2?" "Well, Sam, remember when you had that last heart attack and you were needing that very tricky operation, and no surgeon wanted to touch you?... Remember how Dr. DeBakey came all the way up here to do the surgery himself and then you were in good shape again?... Well...." "Oh my god!!

"Oh, just a wild guess," she said. <br>  <br>  The next pupil was the candy shop owner's daughter. The teacher held her gift overhead, shook it, and said, "I bet I can guess what it is. A box of sweets." "That's right, but how did you know?" asked the girl. "Oh, just a wild guess," said the teacher. <br>  <br>  The next gift was from the son of the liquor store owner. The teacher held the package overhead, but it was leaking. She touched a drop of the leakage with her finger and touched it to her tongue. "Is it wine?" she asked. "No," the boy replied, with some excitement. <br>  <br>  The teacher repeated the process, taking a larger drop of the leakage to her tongue. "Is it champagne?" she asked. "No," the boy replied, with more excitement. The teacher took one more taste before declaring, "I give up, what is it?"

However, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished. <br>  <br>  Finally, the son said, `Father, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have a pink ping pong ball.' <br>  <br>  The father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, `If it is a pink ping pong ball that you want, a pink ping pong ball you shall have.' <br>  <br>  And so, the next day, the son was given as his bithday present a pink ping pong ball. <br>  <br>  The boy took the ball to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong ball was gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong ball, however, was never seen again. <br>  <br>  The next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday. <br>  <br>  `Father,' replied the son, `I have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.' <br>  <br>  The father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. he said therefore, `If it is a tenpack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a tenpack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.' <br>  <br>  And so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a tenpack of pink ping pong balls. <br>  <br>  The boy took the tenpack of balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ball remained, merely the empty husk of the tenpack. The father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again. <br>  <br>  The next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday. <br>  <br>  `Father,' said the son to this, `I have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.' <br>  <br>  The father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. `A carton of pink ping pong balls?' <br>  <br>  `A carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed. <br>  <br>  `I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,' said the father, `but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.' <br>  <br>  And so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls. <br>  <br>  The boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared. <br>  <br>  `Dear son,' said the father, `I must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?' <br>  <br>  The son, however, was reluctant to tell him. `Please humour me, dear father.' <br>  <br>  The carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again. <br>  <br>  The next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. <br>  <br>  `Dearest father,' the son started, `I have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.' <br>  <br>  One of these years, his father thought, I should get to the bottom of this. However, he decided to humour his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. <br>  <br>  The next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. The son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home. <br>  <br>  The following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. The father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left. <br>  <br>  The following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. He asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong. <br>  <br>  `Father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year I ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.' <br>  <br>  It was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country. <br>  <br>  The next day, the father took his son to the harbour and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there. <br>  <br>  `Father,' the son said, `You've made me very happy yet|`|zSWt0sYzaa	ok.<br>  what does pink panther say when he steps on an ant?<br>  dead ant, dead ant, dead ant, dead ant, dead ant dead anttttt.<br>  <br>  [say it to the pink panthr song then its funny)|`|uYDoPNv9aa	this might be a kinda racist joke but here it is..<br>  WHY DO THE MEXICANS THINK THEY OWN THE SCHOOL?<br>  ANSWER: CUZ THERE DAD BUILT IT AND THERE MOM CLEANS IT!hahahahahhaa i hope your not mexican,<br>  that joke just cracks me up.|`|IHGHHBGbaa	yo mama was so stupid that she stared for hours at a orange jug that said "concentrate"|`|JIvvg6f7aa	A horse goes into a bar . the bartender says why the long face

VAb2mSg0aa	THE READER opens in post-WWII Germany when teenager Michael Berg becomes ill and is helped home by Hanna, a stranger twice his age. Michael recovers from scarlet fever and seeks out Hanna to thank her. The two are quickly drawn into a passionate but secretive affair. Michael discovers that Hanna loves being read to and their physical relationship deepens. Hanna is enthralled as Michael reads to her from "The Odyssey," "Huck Finn" and "The Lady with the Little Dog." Despite their intense bond, Hanna mysteriously disappears one day and Michael is left confused and heartbroken. Eight years later, while Michael is a law student observing the Nazi war crime trials, he is stunned to find Hanna back in his life - this time as a defendant in the courtroom. As Hanna's past is revealed, Michael uncovers a deep secret that will impact both of their lives. THE READER is a story about truth and reconciliation, about how one generation comes to terms with the crimes of another. Written by The Weinstein Company <br>  <br>  Middle aged German barrister Michael Berg recollects to himself his lifelong acquaintance with Hanna Schmitz, a relationship with whom he never disclosed to anyone close to him. Michael first met Hanna in 1958, when he was fifteen, she thirty-six. The two had a turbulent summer long love affair, dictated by Hanna that their encounters would begin with him reading to her followed by lovemaking. Michael next encountered Hanna in 1966, when Michael, now a law student, attended the Nazi war crimes trial of five female former S.S. concentration camp guards, one of whom is Hanna. Through listening to the testimony, Michael comes to the realization that he is in possession of information which could save Hanna from a life in prison, information which she herself is unwilling to disclose. In deciding what to do, Michael is torn between his differing views of justice|`|BHpELpEqaa	This like teenage boys has some like affair thing with this lady and many years later he is telling the story to someone else. then the lady ends up being like someone who helped nazi people or something i don't know sounds weird

u86NV1Enaa	No, Not at all.<br>  It is very healthy to do so because, we must love ourselves in order to love others.<br>  Relationships often brake, and most of them because they do not know How To Love, and every single thing triggers separation or a break up.<br>  We must love ourselves, knowing what love is, who we are, and what are our needs and our goals in life. Love one self enough to give to ourselves happiness and success in life. Then, we'll be prepared to do it again, but this time with someone else...|`|EPaYoJaiaa	no but there IS a very fine line between loving yourself and being too full of yourself.

kTxeGj1aaa	A blonde, wanting to earn some money, decided to hire herself out as a handyman-type and started canvassing a wealthy neighborhood. She went to the front door of the first house and asked the owner if he had any jobs for her to do.<br>  <br>  "Well, you can paint my porch. How much will you charge?"<br>  The blonde said, "How about 50 dollars?" The man agreed and told her that the paint and ladders that she might need were in the garage. The man's wife, inside the house, heard the conversation and said to her husband, "Does she realize that the porch goes all the way around the house?"<br>  The man replied, "She should. She was standing on the porch."<br>  <br>  A short time later, the blonde came to the door to collect her money.<br>  "You're finished already?" he asked. "Yes," the blonde answered, "and I had paint left over, so I gave it two coats. "Impressed, the man reached in his pocket for the $50. "And by the way," the blonde added, "that's not a Porch, it's a Ferrari."<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  A few months ago, there was an opening with the CIA for an assassin. These highly classified positions are hard to fill, and there's a lot of testing and background checks involved before you can even be considered for the position. After sending some applicants through the background checks, training and testing, they narrowed the possible choices down to two men and a woman, but only one position was available.<br>  <br>  The day came for the final test to see which peson would get the extremely secretive job. The CIA men administering the test took one of the men to a large metal door and handed him a gun. "We must know that you will follow our instructions whatever the circumstances," they explained. "Inside this room, you will find your wife sitting in a chair. Take this gun and kill her." The man looked horrified and said, "You can't be serious! I could never shoot my wife!" "Well," said the CIA man, "you're definitely not the right man for this job then."<br>  <br>  So they brought the second man to the same door and handed him a gun. "We must know that you will follow instructions no matter what the circumstances," they explained to the second man. "Inside you will find your wife sitting in a chair. Take this gun and kill her." The second man looked a bit shocked, but nevertheless took the gun and went in the room. All was quiet for about 5 minutes; then the door opened. The man came out of the room with tears in his eyes. "I tried to shoot her; I just couldn't pull the trigger and shoot my wife. I guess I'm not the right man for the job."<br>  <br>  "No," the CIA man replied, "You don't have what it takes. Take your wife and go home."<br>  <br>  Now they only had the woman left to test. They led her to the same door to the same room and handed her the same gun. "We must be sure that you will follow instructions no matter what the circumstances; this is your final test. Inside you will find your husband sitting in a chair. Take this gun and kill him." The woman took the gun and opened the door. Before the door even closed all the way, the CIA men heard the gun start firing, one shot after another for 13 shots. Then all hell broke loose in the room. They heard screaming, rashing, and banging on the walls. This went on for several minutes; then all went quiet.<br>  <br>  The door opened slowly, and there stood the woman. She wiped the sweat from her brow and said, "You guys didn't tell me the gun was loaded with blanks. I had to beat the son of a ***** to death with the chair!"<br>  <br>  <br>  Have a nice day! :)|`|INmPiwnMaa	HOW TO IMPRESS THE GIRLS<br>   <br>  <br>  A Polish man was walking along the beach in France. There are many beautiful women lying in the sun, and he really wants to meet one. But try as he might, the women don't seem to be at all interested. Finally, as a last resort, he walks up to a Frenchman lying on the beach who is surrounded by adoring women. <br>  <br>  "Excuse me," he says, taking the guy aside, "but I've been trying to meet one of those women for about an hour now, and I just can't seem to get anywhere with them. You're French. You know these women. What do they want?"<br>  <br>  "Maybee I can help a leetle beet," says the Frenchman. "What you do ees you go to zee store. You buy a leetle bikini sweeming suit. You walk up and down zee beach. You meet girl very qweekly zees way." <br>  <br>  "Wow! Thanks!" says the Pole, and off he goes to the store. He buys a skimpy red bathing suit, puts it on, and goes back to the beach. He parades up and down the beach but still has no luck with the ladies. So he goes back to the Frenchman. <br>  <br>  "I'm sorry to bother you again," he says, "but I went to the store, I got a swimsuit, and I still haven't been able to meet a girl." <br>  <br>  "Okay," says the Frenchman, "I tell you what you do. You go to zee store. You buy potato. You put potato in sweeming suit and walk up and down zee beach. You will meet girl very, very qweekly zees way." <br>  <br>  "Thanks!" says the guy, and runs off to the store. He buys the potato, puts it in the swimsuit, and marches up and down the beach. Up and down, up and down he walks, but the women will hardly even look at him. <br>  <br>  After half an hour he can't take it anymore and goes back to the Frenchman. "Look," he says, "I got the suit, I put the potato in it, and I walked up and down the beach, and still nothing! What more can I do?" "Well," says the Frenchman, "maybe I can help you a leetle beet. Why don't you try moving zee potato to the front of zee sweeming suit?"|`|CpHhkDQlaa	knock knock who's there inturtrepting cow inturtreping  mooo

WMR8hVlfaa	I am fairly certain if Heath was alive tonight the award would have gone to Phillip Seymour Hoffman. The Academy is still rather stuck up when it comes to who/what wins, and Doubt was just phenomenal. That said, Heath is an amazing actor and definitely deserved the nod.

I saw a show from a few years ago where the show paid to add on to the ridiculous house they live in. I think the Duggar's are horrible. The amount of natural resources that that family uses is way over the top. I also think they are ridiculous for teaching their children the things that they do. They are preposterous all around.
