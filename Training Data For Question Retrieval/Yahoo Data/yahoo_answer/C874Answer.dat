d20feb0d03f94b65cc82fb1a12566011aa	The Federal Reserve is a unique legal entity that can be described as an independent government agency with member bank participation. It is organized with a 100% government agency at the top (the Board of Governors), and branches beneath them that are organized like corporations with member banks as shareholders.(Ref: <a href="http://www.federalreserveeducation.org/fed101/structure/" rel="nofollow">http://www.federalreserveeducation.org/f...</a> , <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/generalinfo/faq/faqfrs.htm#4" rel="nofollow">http://www.federalreserve.gov/generalinf...</a> )<br>  <br>  The Board of Governors are all appointed for 14-year terms by the president and confirmed by congress. It operates per it's charter and laws set by congress. it is overseen by congress. There is no structure or mechanism for private ownership at this level; it is a government agency. You can confirm this from a number of government sites that list it as a government agency (e.g. <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/government/independent-agencies.html)" rel="nofollow">http://www.whitehouse.gov/government/ind...</a> Board members are forbidden by law to have any economic interest in a private bank. (Ref: Title 12 chapter 3 of the U.S. Legal Code). The Board determines monetary policy and provides high level oversight of the branches. <br>  <br>  The 12 branches can be considered highly regulated private corporations. Member banks are required to buy shares in their branch. Each bank has one vote.  They can vote for 6 of their 9 board members, the other 3 are appointed by the Board of Governors.  Though the branches are called non-profit, the member banks get a standard 6% dividend on their shares. The remaining 'profit' is turned over to the Treasury at the end of the year. <br>  <br>  For confirmation on this, check out how Hoovers classifies them: <br>  <a href="http://www.hoovers.com/free/search/simple/xmillion/index.xhtml?query_string=Federal+Reserve&which=company&page=1&x=91&y=2#HooversCompanyNameMatchesH2" rel="nofollow">http://www.hoovers.com/free/search/simpl...</a> <br>  <br>  And those shares that the member banks own? Some say there are so many restrictions that it falls short of true ownership<br>  <br>  From Edward Griffin, noted anti-fed intellect (<a href="http://www.bigeye.com/griffin.htm)" rel="nofollow">http://www.bigeye.com/griffin.htm)</a><br>  <br>  "It's a hybrid, part corporation and part government, part private, part government.<br>  .. <br>  Every bank that's in the system is an owner of the Federal Reserve...  But that's as far as it goes because those stock certificates do not carry with them any of the attributes of private ownership. For example, the holders of these certificates cannot sell them. If you can't sell something then you don't really own it, that's one of the tests of ownership, your ability to dispose of it. You cannot sell it. Furthermore the larger banks put up more money than the smaller banks, it's a ratio to their assets, so the larger banks have more stock certificates in the system than the small ones and yet regardless of the number that they hold, every bank has just one vote. There's another violation of the principle of private ownership. Furthermore that vote doesn't buy them anything. They can't vote for anything of substance; they cannot vote for their national management which is the most important thing, isn't it? The board of directors and chairman of the Federal Reserve System are appointed by the President, they're not elected by the banks that are part of the system, the President does that."|`|zQiYKgMLaa	I believe it's a partnership b/w 7 people/entities. Two of which are the owners of the Bank of England.  I think the remaining 5 are actually American.<br>  <br>  I doubt they're selling themselves out to China, however our Government sure seems to be.  Many of the loans that are being backed by our Government are going to them as are many of our classified things.  However, the Chinese markets have crashed as well, so they're in no better shape than we are which is somewhat alarming as they may want to start recalling some of their loans in thier current state.

XxUsLqXRaa	Obviously, you're considering a loan from one of those "loans-in-a-box" outfits because a real bank would not bother with an amount so small.  If that's the case, then I would say YES your score is plenty high enough to get a $500 loan.  But be very careful.  First of all the interest rates are astronomically high.   Even if you paid off the loan the very next day, you'll owe an interest charge so pay it off as soon as possible.  And do NOT allow them to tempt you into borrowing more than what you went in there seeking.  They make their money by screwing people over so, if you MUST borrow from them, make it your first priority to pay them back very soon.  Also, just an FYI:  the sheer fact that you borrowed money from one of those places will drop your credit score a few points, even if you paid them back promptly.  It doesnt look good when you have to resort to a loan shark.  I hate to take advantage of friends, but is there no way your friend could hold out for a few more weeks until you come up with the money on your own?

sLlSKHyraa	That is about right. For the last 6 years or so since my husband and I had children we used H & R Block (until we had a issue with there bank of getting our refund last year even though we paid for the rapid refund and they approved and then decided to only give us half and then make us wait 2 weeks for the other half)  and I was the only one that had a W2 (since my husband is disabled) and we were charged about that amount. <br>  <br>  This year we used Turbo Tax.

Pretty expensive stuff for mediocre returns. When I was young, single, and claimed myself (tax) I used H&R Block to do my taxes, mind you i never got back all that much in the way for a refund.

9ko5WUFkaa	I'm not an 'exoctic dancer' but I have a good friend that is, so this is what I know from where I live (a smallish town)...<br>  <br>  1)  Earnings can depend from place to place - most pay a hourly, per-show or per-night rate plus you get to keep your tips, some keep a proportion of your tips but tend to pay a better per hour rate.  If you're really good you want to earn from tips and lap dances.  Depending on how many times you perform in a shift you can earn upwards of $500 a night.<br>  <br>  2)They have to be 18 (where I live - that's the legal age for drinking)<br>  <br>  3) Most girls don't tell future employers where they were working and a lot of them have a normal day job or are single mums, so it's not really an issue.  You just don't mention it unless you're certain they won't care.<br>  <br>  4) The girl I know loves it - she is in control and  it's just another form of performing.  She knows she can't do it forever so she's making the most of it while she can.  She owns her own house, drives a great car and her kid has everything it he ever wants.  For the most part, the girls she works with get along great and are like a family - they watch out for each other.<br>  <br>  5)  If you work at a decent place the risks are pretty much nil.  The environment is stricly controlled and bouncers are always nearby if anything gets out of hand.  The only problem I've heard of was one guy that got really obsessive about one of the girls.  Living in a small town, he found out who she was and started stalking her.  He was caught by the cops and now has a restraining order against him.  If he ever goes near her again he'll have a nice prison holiday.<br>  <br>  Really, it's just a job and a damn good paying one at that!|`|5nfqY9T7aa	1) Anywhere from 300+<br>  2) 18 (here in Texas)<br>  3) The money is very easy to get used to, so yes for a while.<br>  4) It can be, but it can also be a hassle 'cause you get judged.<br>  5) The risks are the social stigma, people think you're a prostitute, you have to deal with some jerks sometimes, and you have to be very mature. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|tsNMMLMUaa	1: I really think it depends on the town. But from what I know, if it is concidered "on the books," then they can't get any less than minimum wage.<br>  <br>  2: Obviously 18 or 21, if you live in America. You'd have to check, because I know most dance-clubs or bars or whatever serve alcohol so they usually must be 21.<br>  <br>  3: Well, obviously it depends on the next job. If you want to work at a preschool, I'd suggest you use a different reference.<br>  <br>  4: Well, that too, depends on the place. If it is an upscale gentlmens club with people who are relaxed and want to enjoy some dancing and some talking and music, then yeah. The girls are friendly with eachother, and they seem to hang out and enjoy dancing together. But if it is a trashy place, you may feel like an animal, and the guys will be raunchy perverts who aren't there to see an "exotic dance" because all they really want is a twat-shot and some groping.<br>  <br>  5: Sex for cash is illigal in most states of the U.S. <br>  The risks are all common sense. People may stalk you if they like you and you don't give them more than they want. People may talk trash about you and ruin your reputation. You may feel guilty or used, if you are not comfortable with your body.<br>  Most of these are all easy to figure out.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|57j6hSjNaa	1. It varies, even in a bigger city.

Its about paying bills at the end of the day..<br>  <br>  5. Clients will sometimes become obsessed and stalk the strippers.

Boarding houses you have to share a bathroom with the other tenants.  Did you rent this unit sight unseen? I can not understand how you would sign a contract without know information about the bathroom set up.<br>  If the owner told you that you would have a private bathroom and not you find out you would, you have the right to withdraw your contract. <br>  <br>  You can contact the Fair Housing Department and make sure that this place is licensed to operate as a rental.  I know of situations where the person was renting out the basement and it did not have a bathroom, and that is illegal.|`|YbP8WYKGaa	Usually it does not need to describe whether the bathroom has to be shared or is a public one outside your unit in a contract. You DO need to check out the place; ask the landlord everything that's matter to you BEFORE you sign a contract. In the contract, the LL just need to state how he gonna charge you the utilities. <br>  <br>  To me, a shared bathroom and a public bathroom is totally two different things. He has to state in the contract he'll paid the utilities of the bathroom to just make it fair. Read your contract carefully. If you are month-to-month and don't want to continue the tenancy, give him 30 day notice and move.   If the contract says he can change the term of tenancy, he can.  Just as he can increase the rent without your consent as long as the contract allows him to do that.|`|AA12300977	The one you signed is the one that is legal.

A reasonable person should conclude that if the bathroom is located outside the apartment then its a community bathroom.<br>  <br>  If the contract states it does have a bathroom then you might be able to void the contract.  That's assuming YOUR copy states it has a bathroom but it doesn't have a bathroom.<br>  <br>  Basically, if your apartment has everything that your contract states then there is probably nothing you can do about it.<br>  <br>  First time renting huh?<br>  <br>  PS...keep an open mind though...could be a hot chick you're sharing it with.|`|4YbRo4ejaa	It doesn't sound legal.

It can be quite overwhelming if you try to take the whole of it in a single bite. There are so many facets of search engine optimization, from how search engines work (and they all work a little differently) to how a web page is designed. There are enough elements to worry about that you could spend far more time than you can afford to invest in trying to achieve the SEO you have in mind. However, search engine optimization doesn’t have to be such an onerous task that it can’t be accomplished. Not if you understand what it is and how it works.<br>  To increase the traffic u need for your website:<br>  You can:<br>   Create a web site that contains meta tags, content, graphics, and keywords that help improve your site ranking.<br>   Use keywords liberally on your site, so long as they are used in the correct context of your site topic and content.<br>   Include reciprocal links to your site from others as long as those links are legitimate and relevant.<br>   Encourage web site traffic through many venues, including keyword advertising, reciprocal links, and marketing campaigns.<br>   Submit your web site to search engines manually, rather than waiting for them to pick up your site in the natural course of cataloging web sites.<br>  <br>  You can’t:<br>   Trick search engines by embedding hidden keywords in your web site. This is a practice that will very likely get you banned by most search engines.<br>   Artificially generate links to your site from unrelated sites for the purpose of increasing your ranking based on link analysis. Most search engines have a built-in mechanism that will detect this type of deceptive practice.<br>   Artificially generate traffic to your web site so that it appears more popular than it is. Again, there are safeguards in place to prevent this from happening, and if you trip those safeguards, you could end up on the banned list for many search engines.<br>   Force your web site to appear in search engine rankings by submitting the site repeatedly for inclusion in the rankings. A good general rule of thumb is that you should submit your site once and then wait at least six weeks before submitting it again. Submitting it repeatedly<br>  will, again, only lead to something nasty like being banned from the search engine.<br>   Expect search engines to automatically rank you at the top of your topic, category, or keyword as soon as the site is picked up. It could take a little time to build the “status” that you need to reach a high search engine ranking. Remember, SEO is a process.<br>  <br>  For more information, i suggest you read Wiley SEO book by Jerri L.

However, set your blog up (try blogger because you can earn money by putting adds on).  Then, get lots and lots of people to visit your blog daily, then try to get adds on your page.  It will take a while and you really need to build up readership before anything exciting happens since you'll most likely only get money when unique visitors click on the ads on your page.

cf6a08b891f8a8a0c7d4d3e273d79cc3aa	Create a a presentation, then if you have a video camera I would set it up on a tripod and film yourself giving the presentation.   Then watch it back and see what you don't like about yourself and what you feel you need to change.  Ask yourself if you would listen and then have your friends or family watch and ask them what they like what they don't like.  You learn from experience.   So the more you do a presentation the better you get.  Be willing to take constructive criticism.  Know what you are presenting and learn everything you can about the subject or project.  The more comfortable and knowleable you are the more comfortable you will be speaking about it.   They do have public speaking classes, or if you belong to a religion or church that you could do readings or speak to the young people take advantage of this to get comfortable speaking to strangers.  Most people will tell you that they get sweaty hands or feel sick when they do this and that is normal even the best sometimes mess up, be willing to laugh it off and continue.  Hope this helps.|`|AA11613218	practice, practice, practice.  Use natural gestures and try to speech naturally too.

Avoid a monotone at all costs! Physically, be for real. Don't be stiff. You want to look like the person anyone could talk to. So talk TO the audience, not AT them. Also, if you have the freedom, move around. Walk up to different people as you're talking and try to make eye contact with all sides of the room, and back and front rows too. Know your topic, and enjoy it. If you enjoy presenting it, the audience will enjoy your presentation. Verify facts before presenting them - you could be challenged. So be prepared for questions, both inquisitive and challenging.|`|38624948ca8652b7718b69f320e62462aa	checkout ToastMasters, Dale Carranegie, and other various public speaking programs or take a speach class or drama class at a community college.|`|8fda0015811b35880ca1b8ba4f7ab926aa	there are speech power classes youcan attend to, they have the basic know-how to improve on these skills. don't forget that  "practice makes perfect" be a critic of your own self.|`|957dd493cdc9abf12b2cb5e1060bb4a3aa	You need to listen and practise more.

931624c2e999725f43239781584214a4aa	I would suggest using a mortgage planner.  A mortgage planner (a.k.a. broker or consultant) will be able to pull your credit, analyze your situation and shop your specific situation and needs to several different lenders.<br>  <br>  They may also have very close relationships with lenders which allow them to get better pricing or options, coupled with extensive experience on how to present peoples situations in the best possible light; they can be your best tool at getting your loan.<br>  <br>  A good analogy is to compare it to a baseball team, which has a manager, a batting coach, a pitching coach, a physical trainer etc...  You also should have a team of professional advisors you can trust and deal with in an ongoing basis.|`|c537b67341a916c06afb011d53b1712daa	Go to the nearest bank or financier.|`|5fab3dd9718021d0aaf4b907487bc8dfaa	Go to bankrate.com. They list lenders sorted in different criteria, depending on your need. Pick banks who are direct lenders, meaning they do business directly with you. Each application with a bank only costs you one inquiry on your credit report. Stay away brokers like ditek.com who do nothing but send your information to some six or seven banks, each one running your credit report, costing you six or seven inquiries.  You may find that your brick and mortar local banks listed with their offerings at bankrate.com as well.<br>  Once you find a loan with a bank that suits your need, call them up instead of filling out their online application. Ask all your questions on the phone before committing to applying, because each time you apply, they run your credit report, one more inquiry detrimental to your credit report.<br>  Good luck.|`|7edddfea16a8232b26818c9d79430e15aa	a mortgage company.|`|819b8e8e925624dafd3a7bfecd241e1faa	1.

U6uZfPG5aa	I believe that a mission statement is extremely important, but more important is that the company/ person believes/lives and follows the mission statement. If it is not truly believed or followed and "lived in day to day operation", it is just lip service and is worthless and just a "bunch of words".  Top management sets the example and ALL decisions must follow the basic tenets of the mission statements.  For example, many companies say that the customer is the most important, but then the management and employees treat them like "they are being inconvenienced".  The mission statement must be imbedded into the company culture.  In the same example, if there is a customer and they are not being waited on, a manager(even an executive) should take care of the customer and follow thru and provide excellent customer service.  Many managers either blow off the customer or "hand them off" and say it is "not my job".  In this example, it is EVERYONE's JOB and responsibility to esure customer service.|`|53459eb8a38e5abd9fbf2621a324ddddaa	it is highly critical but a statement is a statement as long as you do it............|`|29e81b4cb6e9f173025ba2933b36e6f2aa	It is highly critical.

Tengo 3 anos trabajando para la misma organizacion y gracias a Dios me he tomado casi cada ano unas vacaciones de 1-3 meses. Eso fue porque ya no soportaba  mi jefa (a como la describes parece que estamos hablando de la misma persona). Tengo 8 meses que regrese a la compania (tenia pensado abrir mi propio negocio pero me gaste el $$ y tuve que volver a trabajar). Ahora estoy embarazada, 5 meses, y obtengo beneficios que en otra compania tal vez no obtendria (seguro medico, dias de enfermedad, dias feriados pagados, trabajo de lunes-viernes, flexibilidad para mis citas en el doctor,etc.). Aunque mi jefa ha cambiado de todos modos no creo dejar el trabajo por ahora.  Para despuesque nazca mi bebe voy a tener 12 semanas pagadas y la oportunidad de regresar bajo mis propios terminos.  La verdad es que adoro lo que hago (trabajo en una organizacion no lucrativa) y lo haria gratis.  Creo que tanto rollo para esa pregunta: te gusta lo que haces? Dices estas aburrida y tal vez puedas darte la oportunidad de cambiar. Si eres joven, sin tantas responsabilidades, te aconsejaria que te aventaras, deja el trabajo si no te satisface. Eso si, no quemes puentes por que nunca sabes que vueltas da la vida.  Da lo mejor de ti y demuestrate que eres muy capaz.  Si no te valoran, los que pierden son ellos y hay muchos otros lugares donde puedan valorarte.  Te deseo lo mejor y yo creo que no hay trabajo ni dinero que valga tanto como mi bienestar (PERO piensala bien).

Good Luck.|`|AA11689215	Spirit,<br>  <br>  I had SBC (now AT&T) for 2 years due to a DSL contract.  I had an all inclusive plan, so my bill should have been the same every month.  It wasn't.  When I called to inquire about the increase on various occasions, like you I was given rude service (I even got hung up on), they refused to explain my bill, or the few times when someone offered me a credit, I never saw it.<br>  <br>  In August when my contract was over, I switched to MCI's Neighborhood Plan.  They are a little more expensive, but you get credits every month that bring your bill down.  <br>  <br>  In October, my bill was $7.15.  I called them to let them know I was underbilled (I like them that much) and they gave me a full month's credit for their mistake!<br>  <br>  Check the www.CA.gov and look for the Public Utilities Commission.  This is where you go to complain against a utility.<br>  <br>  I have made many, many complaints regarding SBC in the past.  Sometimes I think it's useless.<br>  <br>  Oh, also, remember the heavy storms from a year ago?  I ended up with very bad static on my line.  It took them about a month to fix it, and they REFUSED to give me credit for my unusable phone.  One rep even said that she could not hear the static (mind you she was yelling over top of it).  I ended up calling a Supervisor to complain about that whole situation.  When she asked "What can we do to make you happy?"  I said "Get me out of my DSL contract so I can switch to MCI."  Naturally, she said NO.<br>  <br>  I could go on and on.  They are a horrible company.|`|e45bd0fa3714388748db2e22cbeb3ce5aa	consumeraffairs.com

This is not like the olden days, where the credit card was issued after at least a month.<br>  <br>  Internet Technology and Security – Secret of Instant Approval<br>  <br>  Internet has completely revolutionized all aspects of our lives and one of them is credit card approval. It has totally altered the manner in which card-issuing banks can find consumer information and take a decision on an applicant’s credit worthiness. Almost all major financial institutions who offer credit cards, let you fill the application online by using the Internet. These sites are secure and you can submit it just by clicking a button, and then within few moments you will be informed of their decision. Usually if your credit rates from good to excellent, you will get approved immediately and very soon you will be the proud owner of the credit card.<br>  <br>  The secret of instant approval credit cards is the speed of the Internet and the advanced communication networks designed for the banking industry. As soon as you submit your application, banks can now immediately find your identity and get your credit history from either of the 3 national credit bureaus, to check if your FICO score fulfills their selection criteria. Your FICO score is a mathematical computation done by each credit bureau to grade your credit history on a range of 0 – 800.|`|AA11766557	Hey<br>  the best three to use are <br>  1.

8bqhG3zZaa	Keogh is a retirement account for self employed or small business owner.  <br>  The investment amounts are different for different type of plans as that is how they were put in under the law.<br>  Simple, SEP, Keogh, 403b, 401k, etc., all have different limits.  <br>  IRAs have different contribution limits based on your age (above below 50).<br>  Maybe the government does not want to lose too much money on the taxes now.  This would be the case if the investment limit was too high.
AA12257018	That's fine, just have them state that the seller will credit buyer 15k for repairs in the purchase offer. The real question is if you're willing to finance the 15k to fix up the place, because that's what you're doing in actuality. <br>  <br>  You might also want to play hardball because the owner acknowledges that his place is 15k overpriced. Have the seller not only credit you 15k for repairs, but also pay all closing cost and buy down your loan by a point. Also, it seems like your agent is not looking out for your best interest. Make sure the home is worth 115k. Look at www.zillow.com for homes that sold recently in the same area as this one. I would also have the real estate agent show you comps for your area and explain why he thinks that you should offer 130k.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I wish you well.<br>  <br>  Regards|`|AA10001157	I was thinking to talk you out of this deal as the housing market continues to slump.

I have bought houses before and have never heard of doing it that way.|`|b702bd00d070b9a4e0c39cce4658478daa	As a buyer using a buyer's agent, you should have signed paperwork ahead of time showing the actual commission agreement between the agent and you.  It is most typical for the agent to get a percentage of the sale price as commission (and most of the time that commission is paid by the seller... if not, you would be responsible for covering it).  As stated, your situation sounds very shady and you should consult your real estate attorney, who is not only there to do the paperwork at closing time, but also to advise you as you go along.  Contrary to popular thought, real estate agents are not lawyers and often are not qualified to do much more than list homes, tour them, and talk you into buying them in order to make their commission.|`|d2e65c2cd1bbcc0d538a2e4d681a5228aa	I agree with everyone else I would just ask for the 15,000 off the asking price of the home and if that doesn't work then find another Realtor FAST !! It just seems to me that there may be something else wrong with the house that you may not be able to see with the naked eye or they are just trying to screw you over. Before making an offer on this property I would check all options that are available for other properties in the area and also check he market value of the property to see if the property value has dropped or increased in the past 2-3 years.|`|8e62fd4ddc445b8755e9025caf7c20d0aa	This sounds a little shady to me. The seller should just take the $15,000 off the asking price, but then your agent gets less commission when the deal is sealed. I would ask your agent for a thorough explanation. If they won't try to reason with you and the seller then they are just being tricky and you should go to another brokerage firm.|`|AA11268208	Whatever you do, get EVERYTHING in writing.

You should contact your local police department, and file a report of found property. The police department can attempt to find either the rightful recipient, or the originator. Usually there is a statute of limitations on found proerty, where if the owner is not found, or the property claimed, then ownership reverts to you.

7c2e66e167829806a675dd896e487709aa	William,<br>  <br>  I'm happy to hear that you are having success, good news is always nice to hear. The problem with the home business is not neccessarily the business itself, but all the scams that commonly do come with them.  I have been looking for a home-based business that doesn't come off as a scam for quite some time.  Unfortunately, most opportunities either don't give enough information (scary, lack of info=bad idea in my opinion), just want your money (several places I've tried to contact don't exist, the "business" was a front to get people to send them money for the idea, or to 'take over'), or the company you are going to do the work for has lackluster help if any at all.  Also, network marketing is a rather new term I think, that used to be called pyramiding, which isn't allowed anymore.  I know the set up is different than the old pyramid idea, but the concept is still kind of the same, and a lot of people never did like the old Amway way of doing things.  From what I have seen, as soon as you mention a pay off that is 'pyramid' in shape, you will loose people.  But, if you fully believe in what you are doing, then don't worry about the opinions of others, your success will eventually show through and those people will be regretting not hearing you out.  Keep up the work, and send me some info on that business!|`|985c34486c089abd25c81db678699ea6aa	It is because certain people and certain companies that have been in the direct sales industry have given these opportunities a bad name.<br>  <br>  NETWORK MARKETING ETHICS:<br>  <br>  I have been involved with several network marketing opportunities over my years. I have sold water filters, soap, and legal plans. It is the perception of having to sell something to my friends that they don't want or don't need.<br>  <br>  The issue with the myriad of companies that have network marketing opportunities is that a lot of their products can be purchased elsewhere in some other form. So, you have a lot of competition already when you get started.<br>  <br>  It is when you can find a company that has the "best" of something and is offering it "cheap," or, if the company has the "only" of something, when you have found an opportunity.<br>  <br>  If a person can't come out and say exactly what it is that they are selling, then they are being deceptive and are having to coerce somebody into making a decision.<br>  <br>  With my home-based business, I give samples out and let people try them. When they like it, they ask me how to get more. Up front, they know exactly what it is that they are trying.<br>  <br>  BUSINESS STARTUP COSTS & MONTHLY MINIMUMS:<br>  <br>  A majority of these companies require you to pay a hundred dollars or more just to get started. Then there are other fees and requirements that you have that you didn't know about in the beginning.<br>  <br>  Some companies require a hundred dollars or more in purchasing their products to remain qualified.<br>  <br>  These shouldn't have to be. If a company can't set the system up to be free to start, then they are having to recoup some of their costs from potential distributors and not their products. The monthly minimum should be just that; minimum.<br>  <br>  WRAP UP:<br>  <br>  You asked your question, you got your answer. There is nothing to say that not any one person can't make a lot of money in network marketing. It just has to be the right opportunity and it has to fit the majority of the people.<br>  <br>  I am having very little problem in having people join my business opportunity. Granted, there are people that will say "no" to everything. Here are the benefits of what I offer:<br>  <br>  NO Fees to Participate - Why should you pay a distributor fee to sell for any company? Never pay a distributor fee to join a company ever again! <br>  <br>  Powerful Products - UNIQUE cutting edge exclusive products that work fast! Everything designed in-house by world renowned scientists and doctors! <br>  <br>  Results Sell - Day one you'll feel it, day two you'll love it and day three you'll be telling your friends. <br>  <br>  Manufacturer Direct - Unlike 99% of most so-called "opportunities" who have their products made by someone else and pass high costs on to distributors, this company is the manufacturer direct, and there are no middle sales or multi-level companies. <br>  <br>  Solid Company - A 12 year old manufacturer that has the capability of shipping over $10 million dollars worth of product a day. <br>  <br>  Free Samples to Dealers - They will continually be giving out Free Samples for Dealers to Hand Out. Most companies simply can't afford to do this, but they make the products and understand the importance of getting people to try the product. <br>  <br>  Low Cost - A two months supply for as little as $59. No more trying to sell your friends on buying $200 or $300 of product that they don't need. <br>  <br>  Pays Out Checks Daily - They understand the importance of getting dealers money quick. <br>  <br>  If an opportunity can't match this, then you have to really force yourself to become a part of that opportunity.<br>  <br>  If I can be of further assistance, let me know.<br>  <br>  pktull@yahoo.com<br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/pktull" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/pktull</a>|`|AA11561908	I agree with you completely. The problem is that many people either don't have realistic expectations or are up to no good. It's about equal between the parties. I cannot even begin to count the number of scam advertisements and people wanting to put nothing into making those big bucks.<br>  In the last couple years, a lot of emphasis has been put into making it big from being your own boss, with the image of some guy (or women) taking it easy or spending time with their family. While in many cases, an established (key word) business will allow some freedom, advertisers keep on skipping the part about investment you'll need to make to get there. <br>  So people have this idea they can sit in their underwear (or birthday suit) all day long, spending no money while gaining lots of it. Then they see this wonderful "opportunity" where they only spend *gasp* $20 to start their own business. The website is vague about what they'll be selling but hey, the website does say you can earn over 10k a month. Turns out they get a list of names to call (plus referral fees), the materials don't arrive, or they have to carry/ship stock. Then they proceed to blacken the name of all "similar" businesses. And I'm not making it much more dramatic than it really is.|`|e540c226567d45a2b9f2750a45a76d4baa	You are 100% correct i think it is mostly jealousy and not having control of you as an employer i was part time EBay and my boss hated the idea and assumed i was selling his inventory because every boss is a thief in one way or another EX you clock in at 7.46 you will get paid from 8.00 on but clock in at 8.14 you will get paid from 8.30 on and yes i EBay 100% now.Michael

Your best bet would be to do some research and shop around for the best rates and pricing.<br>  <br>  If you have less than perfect credit, you should expect to pay higher than average interest for the loan.  However, if you pay your bills on time and establish a good mortgage payment history, you can refinance after a year or two and receive a much better rate.<br>  <br>  You might want to work with a mortgage broker who can check rates and prices with a large number of lenders.

Then go and meet these people and see if they appear to want to help you, or if they're just looking for a commission.<br>  <br>  Every Realtor on this site can "find you a Realtor" in your town - and that Realtor would then pay a referral fee for getting to help you.  But don't go that route. Find a friend's Realtor.  You'll know that you've got someone you can trust and that Realtor deserves his client's friends for having properly taken care of his clients.<br>  <br>  Lastly, after you have bought your house, if you liked your Realtor, tell your friends about him.  The Realtor who will do the best for you and your friends is not necessarily the one with the most letters after their name (I have none, but I feel I know ALOT more than most Realtors)  nor the Realtor with the best advertising campaign or website.|`|AA10567299	Ask friends, neighbors for a referral.

Being a great agent does you no good if they are too busy or a jerk.<br>  <br>  The professional designations don't impress me - as an agent I know many inexperienced agents who take all the classes and pay the fee and still don't know what they are doing.<br>  <br>  I can give you some names of good agents in your area if you like.|`|984ae0f7e30dad269ef519dfc18ef393aa	Shop for a realtor that also does the mortgage.

When you begin as an intern, get to know many people from both the tech and finance departments.  <br>  <br>  Since there are so many different departments in a place like Morgan Stanley (i.e. some sort of remittance dpt., research dpt., client services, business development, etc.), it would benefit you to get to know as many people in as many different departments as possible.  Ask them how they got their start.  You'll be surprised to see how many people started in different positions within the company.  If you don't see this, it should raise red flags.

There is more to a dialysis clinic than just the staff on the clinic floor - e.g. social worker, dietitian, medical director - these staffing requirements are contained in Medicare's Conditions of Coverage. These Conditions of Coverage set the rules that dialysis units must abide by in order to serve Medicare patients. Here is a link to a summary comparing the current Conditions of Coverage to proposed Conditions of Coverage which are suppose to go into effect in a few months:<br>  <a href="http://www.esrdnetwork6.org/Correspondence/CMSComparison.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.esrdnetwork6.org/Corresponden...</a><br>  <br>  These rules apply to all dialysis units in the United States but I suspect you are asking what is the minimum staffing ratio for patient care i.e. how many nurses & technicians should there be per patient. Unfortunately the ESRD (dialysis) Conditions of Coverage do not have anything to say about staffing ratios generally. Some States have their own rules, Montana and California, come to mind so if you are asking about staffing ratios in a dialysis unit we’d need to know your state to answer directly.<br>  <br>  In general a one technician to four patient ratio is common with at least one nurse supervising the shift. However, I have heard of much higher ratios (6 to 1) and even lower ratios in Seattle for instance (3 to 1) but there is no minimum standard established for the whole US but there may be one for a particular state.<br>  <br>  A great option if the patient is up for it is home dialysis where one can take care of themselves or have the one on one help of a loved one. Check out <a href="http://www.homedialysis.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.homedialysis.org/</a> for everything you should know about your dialysis options.

Builders do this stuff all of the time. They make you use their sub companies for this reason.They make the money back offering secondary services. Your best option is this. Look at the 11k you are saing. Then look at the difference in payment if you could get a lower rate with a different lender. If it takes you less than 4 years to make up that 11k (divide the 11k by the monthly savings, then divide by 12 for yearly figure), then it is worth to go with a different lender.<br>  Unfortunately, no states have any governing over this sort of practice. It lets builders do what they want, and it puts buyers in sticky situations. Since you are under contract, there isn't much more you can do. But in the future, if you build again, add provsisions to your contract. I had a friend who just put a contract down on a house. We added a provision that said if the builders bank could not match an offer given by one of our banks, they must still offer the builder discount and allow us to go outside for lending. Of course, they matched any deal we showed them. hope this helped!

VUUThRGtaa	I went to a two year radiologic technologist program. I am now a registered radiologic technologist, and I am certified in mammography, and I also do CT as well. I wouldn't worry too much about the not being good in math part. I am not that good in math, and had no problem, there was one class where there was more math than all the others, and that was physics. I really wouldn't worry. Also you don't need to get your bachelors to do mammography. Actually if you like the field, and choose to go into radiology, you don't need anymore schooling after the two year program at all. Whatever school you choose make SURE that you will become ARRT registered when you are done. DONT go to a school that you only get a certificate. There aren't really any jobs out there for those that only when to the certificate school. If you decide to go into sonography then you will have to go back to school for more specialized training for sonography which I think is another year, but that can be done after xray school. There are four year programs that are specific to radiology and you will get your BS but they are as plentiful as the two year AAS programs. If are planning to become a manager in radiology then maybe the BS would come in handy, otherwise radiology is more based on what you know IN the field, not so much the schooling, for instance going to a two year college, and then getting certified for Mammo, and CT, and Sonographyy, MRI etc.

VtuiLyvTaa	Well.....the answer is both!  Both have advantages, so why not do both.  The most important thing is that you start NOW, which ever way you decide.  If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, see if he has matching contributions.  A lot of employers offer something like 50% match up to 3% of your annual salary.  This should be invested in first and formost, as this is free money waiting to be claimed, and all contibutions can be pre-tax. You are deferring taxes until retirement.  This also means that your yearly income for income tax purposes will be lower that if the contributions were made after tax, so you get a lower income tax.<br>  <br>  After you meet the limit on the company match, then look at the Roth IRA.  The Roth will allow you to make a much smaller yearly contribution compared to the 401(k) ($4000 this year for Roth), however the contributions are after taxes.  The wonderful part of the Roth is that the earnings are tax free as well at retirement.  This means that your taxes have been paid on this money at the beginning, and will not be taxed again.<br>  <br>  After maxing out the Roth, put any remaining into the 401(k) up to its limit of $15,000.<br>  <br>  A Roth IRA will give you greater flexibility in determining the investments in it.  A 401(k)'s choices for investment are limited by the plan you are in.  Both of these plans working together will be best.<br>  <br>  **Crazy are you sure of those ages?  They did not have the Roth 23 years ago.  Roth did not come about until 1998....***|`|d377462ec88a0ebb26c29a0f08618e14aa	I think a 401K is better.  Most companies match your contribution.  Also there is more flexibility to move your money to different funds.  You not putting all your eggs in one basket.  Also if you do need the money, you can generally borrow against your 401K and pay it back at 3% interest.  Basically you are borrowing against yourself.|`|pvmNefiZaa	I'm facing the same question. A poster on another board also mentioned that issue of the tax bracket. Since the 401k goes in pre-tax, you pay taxes on it when you withdraw. <br>  <br>  If you think you'll be in a LOWER tax bracket at retirement, the 401k is the better choice (since you avoid paying a high tax rate now, you just defer it and pay the lower rate in retirement).<br>  <br>  If you think youl'll be in a higher bracket at retirement, the Roth is a better choice (since you'll pay the lower tax rate now, instead of a higher tax rate then).<br>  <br>  Of course no one knows for sure what will happen in retirement (and if the tax rate or system will chnge) so a few people have suggested hedging bets and do both.<br>  <br>  Definitely do your 401k to get the most match. Then they said max out your Roth (currently $4,000/year) and then put anything else you can to your 401k.|`|QcaVcxLHaa	Roth IRA, is better.  It is also non taxable.  If you go with a Roth, I would go with the fortune 500.  Because it is the safest choice.  If 1 company goes "belly up" you are still safe because there are 499 other businesses that you have invested in.  With the Roth they are raising the amount you can put into it tax free every year.  I no someone who started investing in the roth when she was 18 years old.  she is 41 years old now and has over $350,000.  Talk to a financial broker about your options and he will be able to break it down for you.  Everyone in my office has a Roth IRA.
BJe74zEBaa	Subprime is typically people with credit scores below 620 looking to finance or refinance a home.  Though there are other factors that would determine eligibility for being considered sub-prime, this a good generalization.<br>  <br>  Subprime lenders make the majority of their money by charging 2 to 3 times what a prime lender would charge in points or orgination fees in order to make as much money as possible on the short term.  The reasoning is that since the lender is also charging 2 to 3% higher than a prime lender, the customer will more than likely refinance as soon as they can qualify for better credit.  <br>  <br>  Subprime is also known to charge 2 to 3 years prepayment penalties so that they can generate another source of income if the borrower decides to refinance.|`|AA10238876	It's a fancy word for "Poor"|`|29e81b4cb6e9f173025ba2933b36e6f2aa	Subprime lending and loans deal with individuals who cannot qualify for ordinary credit by virtue of their own credit histories.

Lenders will use a credit scoring system to determine which loans a borrower may qualify for. Subprime loans carry more credit risk, and as such, will carry higher interest rates as well. Approximately 25% of mortgage originations are classified as subprime.<br>  <br>  Occasionally some borrowers might be classified as subprime despite having a good credit history. The reason for this is because the borrowers has elected to not provide verification of income or assets in the loan application process.|`|b152c8566a6a2e64a1dd6c42e4d5b29baa	I believe it's a loan that Subprime lending, also called "B-Paper", "near-prime" or "second chance" lending, is a general term that refers to the practice of making loans to borrowers who do not qualify for market interest rates because of problems with their credit history. Subprime loans or mortgages are risky for both creditors and debtors because of the combination of high interest rates, bad credit history, and murky financial situations often associated with subprime applicants. A subprime loan is one that is offered at a rate higher than A-paper loans due to the increased risk. Sub-prime therefore is not "Alt-A" because alt-a qualify for the "A-rating" by Moodys or other rating firms' albeit for an "alternate" means.<br>  <br>  Subprime lending encompasses a variety of credit instruments, including subprime mortgages, subprime car loans, and subprime credit cards, among others.<br>  <br>  Subprime lending is typically defined by the status of borrowers. A subprime loan is, by definition, a loan made to someone who could not qualify for a more favorable rate. Subprime borrowers typically have low credit scores and either a limited credit history, or histories of payment delinquencies, charge-offs, or bankruptcies. Because subprime borrowers are considered at higher risk to default, subprime loans typically have less favorable terms than their traditional counterparts. These terms may include higher interest rates, regular fees or an up-front charge.<br>  <br>  Proponents of the subprime lending in the United States have championed the role it plays in extending credit to consumers who would otherwise not have access to the credit market. [1] But opponents have criticized the subprime lending industry for predatory practices such as targeting borrowers who did not have the resources to meet the terms of their loans over the long term. These criticisms have increased since 2006 in response to the growing crisis in the U.S. subprime mortgage industry, wherein hundreds of thousands of borrowers have been forced to default and several major subprime lenders have filed for bankruptcy.

Upon that event occurring, the escrow agent will deliver the asset to the proper recipient, otherwise the escrow agent is bound by his or her fiduciary duty to maintain the escrow account.<br>  <br>  While escrow is best known in the United States in the context of real estate (specifically in mortgages where the mortgage company establishes an escrow account to pay property tax and insurance during the term of the mortgage), escrow companies are also commonly used in the transfer of high value personal and business property, like websites and businesses, and in the completion of person-to-person remote auctions (such as eBay).<br>  <br>  Escrow is also known in the judicial context. So-called escrow funds are commonly used to distribute money from a cash settlement in a class action or environmental enforcement action. This way the defendant is not responsible for distribution of judgment monies to the individual plaintiffs or the court-determined use (such as environmental remediation or mitigation). The defendant pays the total amount of the judgment (or settlement) to the court-administered or appointed escrow fund, and the fund distributes the money (often reimbursing its expenses from the judgment funds).<br>  <br>  In some jurisdictions, real estate brokers are considered to act as escrow agents when they accept deposits and earnest money for the purchase of real property. <br>  <br>  Source code escrow agents hold source code of software in escrow just as other escrow companies hold cash. The highly valuable (and often secret) source code is only released by the agent to either party upon specific terms of the escrow agreement (such as failure to maintain the application, transfer of ownership of the intellectual property rights, or the liquidation of the owner of the source code).<br>  <br>  Escrow is also used in the field of automated banking and vending equipment. One example is automated teller machines (ATMs), and is the function which allows the machine to hold the money deposited by the customer separately, and in case he or she challenges the counting result, the money is returned. Another example is a vending machine, where the customer's money is held in a separate escrow area pending successful completion of the transaction. If a problem occurs and the customer presses the refund button, the coins are returned from escrow; if no problem occurs, they fall into the coin vault.|`|AA12034473	When company issue capital, directors contributions are kept in escrow account till the issue is fully subscribed...

APU4EZXKaa	I am also considering dealing with tem and I also would very much like to get any information from anyone with knowledge about this outfit.  They seam to be extremely aggressive in getting their initial fee of $190 following which the proceed to intensively push a variety of quite expensive “services” in addition to a 7% + fee which one will pay after “they” get you a new job.  This could be a hole in the water to be filled with your $$$.
2ccierKyaa	I've used them in the past.  I also paid the $'s and waited and waited, with no response.  I emailed them, I called them, and never a response.  I should have known something was up when they told me that they have over 6000 "members" in their database and that it was growing.  At $200 a pop, that's over $1.2M in revenue and they didn't even do a thing.<br>  <br>  I have yet to hear from anyone that's had any real success getting a job through them.  I've done searches, asked around, an no one seems to be able to tell me anything.  When I asked them for references in the beginning, I was told that it was confidential and certainly I wouldn't want them to disclose any information about me would they?<br>  <br>  Again, the red flags should have went up, but I went against my better judgement.  If anyone is able to get any information from them or at least a return email or call, let me know.  They're pretty good about calling you when you haven't paid the $195, but as soon as you do, bye bye.  You don't hear from them again.<br>  <br>  You go to this mock "interview" where one of their reps asks you questions.  Lasts for about an hour and afterwards, there's a hard sell on those services that you mentioned.  They range anywhere from $500 upwards.  From which they say you can deduct from your "fee" when they find you a job.  <br>  <br>  This is my own opinion, but I wouldn't sign up with these guys.  They took my money and I haven't heard from them again.  I should have spent the money on beer or something.   At least I would have enjoyed it more.|`|2e7edc32a8153e41fff68023c059d81baa	Sounds a little pricey.

R09cxY0Waa	Congratulations on graduating from college in August!!! That is such a huge accomplishment!!! yay!! <br>  <br>  I'm going through the same process as you almost.  I have just transitioned out of the military and never had really done an actual interview until a few weeks agobut here are some tips. well actually a lot of tips, its lengthy but this is what helped me. I got this info from the <br>  www.dol.gov/elaws/evets.htm<br>  the site was down when I just tried but I can take the time to tell you what the website told me. <br>  <br>  For men you should have:<br>  <br>  hair trimmed neat and clean, have a clean shave.  if you have a beard or mustache be sure to trim neatly.<br>  don't wear sunglasses, <br>  cover your tatoos and remove body piercings<br>  <br>  depending on the position you are applying for wear:<br>  navy blue or gray suit, single breasted and a matching silk tie<br>  or <br>  navy blue or gray jacket; coordinated gray, tan or charcoal slacks; white or pinstripe dress shirt and coordinating silk tie<br>  or <br>  white, pastel or pinstripe dress shirt and conservative tie; coordinated navy blue, gray, charcoal, or brown dress pants; or <br>  plain sports shirt; coordinated navy blue, gray, charcoal, or brown slacks; <br>  or <br>  clean sports shirt and clean casual pants<br>  <br>  The interview is like an in-depth conversation, Count on discussing your skills, experience, training and how they all relate to the duties and opportunites of the job.  You have to sell your, skills, enthusiasm, interst and understaning of the job. <br>  Most interviews break into four stages, <br>  1. Introductory stage,  the interviewer forms an initial impression that can contribute to acceptence or rejection, remember you never get a second chance to make a first impression<br>  2.  questions , the interviewer tries to determine how well your attitude and skills fit with the company image and work culture. The interviewer is trying to match your skill and abilities to the job.<br>  3. Applicant Questions,  the interviewer is trying to deteerminte your level of interest in the job and your degree of knowledge about the company,<br>  4. Closing stage, the interviewer will draw the interview to a close, this is the time to make your intentions clear.  <br>  <br>  Remember also the being assertive is the thing to do, just dont be agressive.  some things to say when the interview is over: <br>  <br>  "after meeting with you, I'm even more convinced that id be a good fit for the position"<br>  <br>  "Interviewers name, when do you plan to fill this position"<br>  <br>  the interviewer will usually tell you.  If so, you can politely suggest you will call that day.<br>  <br>  "If you dont' mind, I'd like to call you on that day to find out what my status is"<br>  <br>  "Would it be ok if I called then to check the status of the position"<br>  <br>  Also, it is absolutely important that you research the company that you are interviewing for.  These questions do come up<br>  <br>  Some other tips:<br>  <br>  prepare questions to ask in the interview<br>  do a dry run of the interview, maybe stand in front of the mirror why you do this<br>  get a good nights sleep<br>  know the names of the interviewer and pronounce them correctly<br>  Arrive 15 minutes early<br>  Turn off your cell phone<br>  Carry a portfolio which includes:<br>  pad and pen, calendar, several copies of your resume, letters of recommendation (if you have any) copy of the application if you have it, samples of work, your notes on the company, your questions to ask the interviewer, reference list/letters of reference.<br>  <br>  offer a firm handshake<br>  Use eye contact , but don't stare<br>  Be enthusiastic have a positive attitude in the interview<br>  Be friendly but not too casual<br>  Be professional and courteous<br>  Don't be negative about anything.  If you have had previous jobs working anywhere, always speak about the previous employer in a good light. <br>  Some tough questions that some run into are belive it or not, <br>  "Tell me about yourself"  When an interviewer ask this, be through but brief. Talk for no more than two minutes, be logical, be positive.   Discuss your educational achievements and goals.  Then briefly describe your qualifications  for the job an contributions you could make to the organization. <br>  <br>  this question can get you the job, <br>  "what do you consider your most significant accomplishment?"<br>  tell a brief story which includes details and your involvement.  The problem, action, resolution organization works well here.  Describe a situation that presented a problem, detail what actions you took to resolve it, and discuss what the resolution was.  You could discuss hard work, deadlines, overcoming obstacles like dealing with difficult people.  How the situation arose and how you dealt with it. <br>  "How do you handle pressure, do you like or dislike these situations?"<br>  High achievers perform well in high pressure situations. usually this question indicates that you will be running into these type of situations and the interviewer wants to know how you will deal. If you perform well, give examples of previous experiences with other employers or even college work if thats all you have.   try to relay the situation as a challenge rather than focusing on your ability to handle pressure.  The interviewer will see you trun a negative situation into a positive situation. <br>  <br>  "what do you consider your most significant strength"<br>  know your four or five key strengths and discuss each with an example.  Examples include that you can lead/manage, good interpersonal skills.  Make sure you have examples of each. <br>  <br>  "what do you consider your most significant weakness"<br>  Show a specific example of this one.  I wouldnt say things like "i'm not punctual" or "I have bad mornings", but the interviewer wants to hear stuff that balances any negative with a positive.  Example. " I tend to be a workaholic, but have learned to better manage my time" which is true for me.<br>  <br>  Also, you want to be able to let the interviewer know that you work well under pressure maybe by staying calm. Diplomacy, perservance and common sense can often prevail even in difficult circumstances.  You must be able to deal with these things on a regular basis.  If you're not sure just remember to stay calm when things go array.  I always used to panic, and then I wouldn't be able to think clearly. The best thing to do in a stressful situation is to remain calm. works everytime!<br>  <br>  I know this is a ton of information, just remember the key things, be punctual, honest, and stay calm.  And if anything else at least do the research of the company.  I hear this is the number one reason people don't get hired, because they don't know what the company offers. Good luck and I hope you get the job!!!|`|GoeDIsvraa	Re-read your resume to anticipate questions.<br>  <br>  Research company before interview (web, facts, stock, technology, product) If asked about what you know about the company, you will WOW them with your research information.<br>  <br>  Print out four clear, crisp, and clean copies of your resume for the interview. One for you and the other for the interviewer, keep the both of you on the same page. (This will show interviewer that you anticipate issues and prepare solutions)<br>  <br>  Personal grooming, Be aware of Facial Hair, Nails, Nose, Teeth, Breath etc.<br>  <br>  Make sure that you made a bathroom stop before heading to interview.

Then shake hands with a firm but non aggressive handshake.<br>  <br>  Offer the clean copy of your resume to the interviewer (“I took the liberty of bringing a clean copy of my resume for you to use”) Keep your copy in front of you.<br>  <br>  Never let your guard down, this is an interview, not a social visit. It is designed to see how you handle stress as well. If you get too comfortable, you may lose your opportunity.<br>  <br>  Smile (when you can), and keep your eyes focused on different areas of the interviewers face, when shifting from time to time from the eyes of the interviewer.<br>  <br>  Never give just “Yes” or “No” answers. Elaborate (The manager wants to visualize what you have done in relation to the question/job/skill)<br>  <br>  If asked about a weakness in skills, turn it into a strength by emphasizing other strengths that support or make up for the specific weakness (using a “like” product or methodology)<br>  <br>  If asked a personal question, shortly elaborate and get back to the business at hand.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|fcc97be1ae1addc02f0b674cef5d4949aa	Congratulations.

Look for questions that someone might ask such as why you left previous jobs, what you liked/disliked about jobs, etc.  Remember you are a salesman and you are selling yourself.<br>  <br>  Get as much information about the company that you can.  Look on their website.  Google them.  Know their business.<br>  <br>  Dress professionally.  Usually that means a business suit.<br>  <br>  Be on time but not too early.  Show up around 5-10 minutes in advance but expect to wait.  Remember your on their time.<br>  <br>  Show confidence with your answers.  Keep good eye contact.  Don't try to hide things from the interviewer.

Look professional and try to suit the culture of the business you're interviewing with.  I would normally advise to wear a suit, but that rule would depend on the vibe of the potential employer.

There are no grants for paying bills, no grants for paying off credit cards, no grants for getting out of debt and no grants for simply fattening your wallet.<br>  <br>  Grants are free, but it means OBLIGATION. You will be obligated to do as the grant sets out to do. Grants have objectives, and your purpose must fit the objective of the grant.<br>  <br>  For one, you have to write the grant application and the grant application is not a simple document - you have to explain how your purpose for applying for the grant fits well with the objectives set out by the grant.<br>  <br>  There is a stringent review process through a committee. You will compete with other applicants for the grant money, and this grant review committee will evaluate the merits of each proposal.

There are two major options to explore.<br>  <br>  The first is to enrol in online MLM programmes.  As Robert Kiyosaki mentioned in his book, "Rich Dad, Poor Dad", MLM programmes are the best and most lucrative form of residual income. <br>  <br>  Currently, the one that has taken the internet world by storm is none other than The NPN.<br>  <br>  The NPN stands for the New Plan Network, and is a program that provides various tools to promote your online business for a low fee of just $10 per month.<br>  <br>  When you sign up you get access to various promotional products including access to a multi-product autoresponder system, a multi-program downline builder, unlimited banner impressions, url tracking system/rotator, NPN internal messaging system, and much more.<br>  <br>  =>  <a href="http://www.thenpn.wealthtreasure.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.thenpn.wealthtreasure.com</a><br>  <br>  These products are easily worth $10 per month alone as they will help you add prospects to your list or downline program, but what I really like about this program is the genuine opportunity to make a lot of money by referring others to this program.<br>  <br>  You can take a look at it and I am sure you will be impressed.<br>  <br>  Then, the next best alternative to make money online is through affiliate programmes.  It is similar ot selling things for companies and earning a commission in return.  The only difference is that afiliate programmes are done online and the audience targetted is usually larger in number.<br>  <br>  If you are keen in setting up a business to go autopilot, but you are unsure of how to go about doing that, you can try the following,<br>  <br>  =>  <a href="http://www.autopilotprofits.wealthtreasure.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.autopilotprofits.wealthtreasu...</a><br>  <br>  If you are serious about making money online, be prepared to spend time learning.

What you have to do is complete surveys and offers for companies that want the public's opinion. By doing this, you are able to earn money very easily for simply giving your opinion or trying out sample products. This is a great service that allows one to work from home, on their spare time, at their leisure, and still bring in a nice sum of money every month. People have made up to $1000 easily on this site by just working on it in their spare time. It is not going to replace a real job's salary, but it is a very nice bonus. There are also many features on this web site, such as contests and special surveys, from which you can redeem extra prizes that would be sent to you with your monthly cheque, such as iPods, Xbox 360s, PSPs, digital cameras, gift certificates, and much more.<br>  <br>  Cheques are sent monthly, and usually arrive about a week or a week and a half into the next month. No payment from you is ever required, not to sign up, not EVER. Unlike other sites that try to scam people out of their money, this site never requires you to pay them.<br>  <br>  "If the site doesn't get paid from me, then why would they have this service going?" - The site doesn't get paid directly from you, but when you complete an offer or survey, they also get paid a small portion of what you earned yourself. For example, if you complete a survey about computers let's say, you would earn maybe $2 and the web site itself would recieve $0.50 from the company also for getting you to complete the survey. These surveys take little time at all, most taking up less than even 1 or 2 minutes of your time.<br>  <br>  Fraud is also a big deal on the Internet these days, and this site recognizes that. That is why they ask for ONLY three bits of information: Your name, email address and your home address. Yup, that is all. No credit card information, no banking information, nothing like that. All they require is your name and address so that your cheque can be sent to your home every month. Your email address is only required to confirm that you have done the offers and surveys. Fortunately, no spam mail or junk mail is ever sent out by this site and your information is never shared with any other company.<br>  <br>  Personally I have been a member of this website, along with thousands of other satisfied users, for approximately 1.5 years now and have earned well over $9100 by working in my spare time. This web site has been great to me, also the members and administrator are very friendly, and are always there to help you with a question or problem you may be having. So far, I've listed only positives about this site, because I can't think of a single negative thing about it.

Those are probably the easiest ways to make money online.<br>  <br>  If your knew to creating websites, I'd reccomend you create a blog at blogger.com then put adsense ads on it.<br>  <br>  As for affiliate programs you should probably join clickbank.com and then promote some of thier products through your blog.<br>  <br>  As you begin to learn more about the internet you can work on other types of websites.<br>  <br>  Once you create your site/blog you need to get traffic to do this you'll need to get links to your website. To do this you should try to get people to put links to you on there website. And you should also put your link on forum signatures and then make posts on forums.<br>  <br>  It will take a long time to start getting traffic but once you do it it will be worth it.

5vTaOzb6aa	How white is white? In terms of paper, there are many different levels of whiteness or brightness. Paper brightness affects the images printed on the paper, especially the vibrancy of the colors.<br>  <br>  Measuring Paper Brightness<br>  <br>  The brightness of a piece of paper is typically expressed on a scale of 1 to 100 with 100 being the brightest. The multipurpose bond paper used in copy machines and desktop printers generally has a paper brightness in the 80s. Photo papers are normally in the mid to high 90s. However, manufacturers often use terms such as Bright White or UltraBright instead of numbers. These labels can be deceiving and not truly indicative of the brightness or whiteness of the paper.<br>  <br>  Shades of White<br>  <br>  Individually white paper appears quite white. But placed side-by-side, white papers show a range of colors from very bright cool white to a softer, warmer pale ivory white. Technically, the more blue light reflecting off the surface, the brighter and whiter the paper appears. For ordinary usage, the best measure of paper brightness is your eye and the appearance of your image on the paper.<br>  <br>  Paper Brightness and Image Color<br>  <br>  The brighter and whiter the paper, the brighter and lighter the images. Colors on less bright papers are noticeably darker. For the most part, images on brighter white paper have more vibrant colors. However, some light colors in an image can appear washed out on the whitest papers.<br>  <br>  Paper Brightness and Finishes<br>  <br>  Photos appear brighter and colors clearer on inkjet photo papers with higher paper brightness ratings. With matte finish papers, a higher paper brightness can make a greater difference than it does among gloss finish papers of varying paper brightness.<br>  <br>  Eye vs. Paper Brightness Rating<br>  <br>  Even when the paper manufacturer supplies a paper brightness rating, the true test is how your images print on that piece of paper with your particular printer. Before making a sizeable investment in a specific type of paper, print some images on in-store printers like your own, ask for paper samples to try at home, or ask your commercial printer or paper supplier for samples printed on paper you are considering.
0LUBf2Juaa	The only tip I can give is not to use 'To whom it may concern'. You're not writing a suicide letter. Find out the name of the person to whom you are writing. It also serves as a demonstration that you have made the effort to seek out information for yourself. A quick phone call to the company, asking who is responsible for recruitment will give you a name and the assurance that your application will not end up in the wrong place.|`|811921e95b3795dad10075b3f9e12029aa	It is good, but it is way too long!  Most of the detail will be in your cv already.  I should like to be considered for- be more specific about the level of the jobs you are applying for : junior? project manager? throw in up to 2 actual job titles you would consider and then say 'or something similar'.    Leave out paragraph 2 and 3 entirely - too much detail.  End by saying - 'I look forward to hearing from you.'    Think of the cover letter as being what you would say if you bumped into them in the corridor- you just want a quick intro and to give them your cv.|`|DF22BQ3yaa	Change should to would in the beginning.

6ohrp7MEaa	I think the biggest weakness of a general partnership is the fact that the partners are personally liable for anything that happens in a business. In other words, if someone has grounds to sue, then they can go after your personal assets such as your home, bank account, etc.    The advantage of a general partnership is that it's taxed at a lower rate. The owners don't get taxed twice like they would in a corporation.
zI2KS0HOaa	<br>  I believe you mean 'mutual funds'.  Mutual funds are a way for a small individual investor like yourself to invest in an account, and have the money go towards the purchase of a wide array of stocks.  For example, investing in a mutual fund that is a "S&P 500 index fund" means that you are pooling your money to buy shares in 500 large companies.  (Note that there are also mutual funds to invest in bonds and other assets -- but I won't be talking about them in the paragraphs below).<br>  <br>  Over the long term, returns on your money will be substantially higher than on CDs or savings accounts.  But the value of your account will fluctuate a lot more than in a CD or savings account, so it's best for money that you won't need for a long while -- like your retirement account.<br>  <br>  Virtually anyone can become a millionaire by investing in the stock market *IF* they invest enough money on a regular basis, and keep it in for the very long term.  NOTE: Those are two really big IFs, though!<br>  <br>  Average return on stocks is estimated at around 10% per year (depending on what time period you look at), but that return varies a lot from year to year (this year, so far, it's been negative, a horrible year.)<br>  <br>  Here is an online calculator that you can use to play around with different figures ($250/month, a 7.5% return instead of 10%, etc.)<br>  <a href="http://www.dinkytown.net/java/InvestmentVariables.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dinkytown.net/java/Investment...</a><br>  <br>  If you are surprised at the results, there are two factors that contribute to this impressive result:  the superior returns of stocks over the long run, and the magic of compounding returns.<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|Tyq8OYm1aa	www.mfea.com, among many other websites, explains the basics of mutual funds.|`|1f34cb08ac2251c3afe6fe04a9dfbc46aa	mutual funds have absolutely nothing to do with loans.<br>  <br>  you aren't renting anything.  you own a small piece of the mutual fund, which in turn owns stock in a lot of companies.<br>  <br>  the S&P 500 has historically returned an average of 10.5%.  if you made contributions of $100 per month for the next 50 years, and invested in a mutual fund that tracks the S&P 500, and you got this historical average return of 10.5% per year (a pretty safe assumption over time), then at the end, you would have contributed exactly $60,000.  It would be worth a little more than $2,100,000.<br>  <br>  it's called compound interest.  it's the secret to building wealth that can last for generations, and making sure you'll never have to worry about money when you get old.
0JoWTQWoaa	Do it yourself. It is easier and cheaper. You should only claim a person if you can meet the IRS support tests.|`|AA11284831	Why pay $100 for what you can get for free?    Forget about your friend claiming her brother.  There are many situations where that's entirely legal and just as many where it's not.  Unless your brother lived in your home for more than half of the year it's not likely that you could claim him.

Hs62xbSbaa	Some are lazy, they want others to sell their product, so they sell them in bulk.

Wouldn't last on eBay.They take so long to ship that people would leave negative feedback and they would be removed by eBay immediately.  They also appear to be a much better deal than they realy are.  The main way that they make their money is when people who have not done any research try to make some easy money.When someone first visit their website they see offers for mp4 players for $15-30 and immediately list them on eBay. Only when the item finally sells and they enter a binding agreement to deliver the item do they realize that there's an extra $30++ for shipping.    I think that you can guess from my answer that I'm not a huge fan of dropshippers. (they cost me my 100% feedback :-(  )
4MypYVHYaa	Normally a pre-approval letter has to be up dated every 90 days. A lender will not continue to renew a pre-approval for ever.

The workers have a union contract and the company can't hire new workers for a cheaper wage as long as there are workers with recall rights.  The buyouts eliminate the recall rights and the workers retire.  The new workers get paid about 50% of what the older workers were getting paid.
NwkZ5OmCaa	You have two ways to file:    2 MFS returns.  Your return is separate from his, so your refund is separate too.    1 MFJ return.  With form 8379 attached, the refund is allocated between the two of you.  Yours is returned to you; his is applied to the debt.  Without the form 8379, the entire refund is applied to the debt.|`|yE2ebQGmaa	They might just keep his portion and not yours. I cant file so i really do not know|`|AjFA8qIxaa	Yes it means exactly that. If you file joint taxes you will get your portion and his portion will be kept cuz as the letter states, his debt is not your responsibility.Legally.
iNBLWIFKaa	Hey Lucien,  I have a lot to say so bear with me...  First off, I would like to say that I am an ebay powerseller and I go back and forth between bronze level and silver level. I've been selling on ebay for a few years. I see the PP said he thinks ebay is drying up but I actually think the opposite is happening. I see that people are turning to ebay for better deals on the stuff they want/need.     First off, don't buy any of those books on how to become an ebay seller or powerseller. They will not give you any better information than what I am going to give you here. They only teach you how to navigate and operate ebay. If you know anything at all about computers, this will not be your problem. Sourcing is the biggest problem that new sellers have. It took me over a year to get good sources of inventory. For some reason, its a big secret and no one will talk about it. Everyone will say, "sell something you are familiar with." While that is true, it doesn't help.    Here is a good website for buying larger lots of inventory. I use them to purchase ladies fashions, clothing and accessories like hair products and designer handbags:  www.liquidation.com    This site used to be good but I have noticed, not so much anymore:  www.propertyroom.com  This site used to be called www.stealitback.com several years ago and it sold police confiscated items, lost luggage and stuff like that.    btw... I'll put all these links in the source box     One of my latest things I have gotten into is taking advantage of free trial offers. Companies know that a certain percent of people will buy the product after a free trial so they give stuff out for free. You can get these things and then cancel your trial and sell it on ebay or craigslist or where ever you want.     There is a "survey" site called Vindale... now, I don't recommend getting on board with this because of the surveys. IMO, absolutely no survey companies are completely legit. But this one is good because they give you surveys that are incentive free trial offers and the like. So, basicly, in laymens terms, Vindale gets paid by the free trial company to refer people because they know that so many people will buy. Vindale will pay you a portion of what they are being paid to try the product and then take a survey on it. Vindale is free to join and some of the surveys/trials require a small "acquisition fee" ie. shipping etc. But Vindale always pays you more than the acquisition fee so now you are getting paid to get the free stuff. Then sell your stuff on ebay. Double-dipping at its best.    But there are a LOT more free trial sites out there. For example, I got free acai berry pills and paid $7 for S&H and sold them for $23 on ebay. That that is a pretty small example though. Sometimes you can get really good stuff on free trial. Just please, always read the fine print and the terms and conditions. I also recommend getting a calendar and marking down which day you need to cancel by so you don't forget. I will link you with a few free trials that I did recently. I could probably link you with hundreds but it would be overwhelming and the offers end all the time so I will just link up some that I did this week.    And this is not secret information. A lot of people are very secretive about what they are selling on ebay. This is not a secret because you can only do each offer one time, unless you have another person who will do it for you like a spouse or girlfriend.    And lastly, believe it or not, you can buy something on ebay and then sell it on amazon or the reverse and make money. Just do your research. You'd be surprised!    Some people also have a lot of success with dropshipping. Personally, I don't like it and won't do it because all the companies I signed up with were selling their products at a price too high. It would have meant only a couple dollars for each item sold. And if the items do not sell you are losing money. idk, maybe I never found the right company? But its worth mentioning because some people do well with it.    I've got lots of links. Only 10 are allowed in the source box so I took out the ones that I wrote in the first part about buying inventory and I took out some of the trials. Sorry, I couldn't link everything :)|`|TpMvr1pyaa	do not bother; 99% of the sellers there earn no net profit.    to earn a profit; there is a world wide approach;    find UNMET needs and fill them.    do not just try to sell stuff "willy nilly."|`|CrmPWcgDaa	hello--IMO, ebay is drying up. People are not buying like they used too.  Majority of items on ebay have no bids.  Ebay is feeling the economy crunch.  I am definetley cutting back on my ebay purchases.
347aR0tbaa	January sounds about right maybe Februrary.  Im in college now, going to be a junior, with older siblings and cousins.  Its always better to start looking earlier than later because the best case scenario is to have something lined up by the time you graduate.  Otherwise you graduate and have your party and everyone asks what your plans are and you have nothing.  Lots of companies are looking to hire new graduates and are specifically looking to interview seniors in school, so if you interview in jan or feb they are expecting you to finish school before you start working.  It is a very long process to find a job, or really the job you want.|`|675228657ad4f09177ede8c847bb9689aa	As soon as you can. <br>  Some places have on campus recruiters- check with your career services office to see who is coming on campus. Those companies are sure to wait for you, should you get the job.<br>  <br>  Also, look for places that will be looking for colleg graduates. It really depends on what you want to do, but many places can wait on you to finish school, or even wait to hire because of it.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|S4gxSYOKaa	i would say no later than a month before no sooner than januray   as long as you are 100% you are going to graduate on time|`|nQhDrfblaa	As soon as you are positive you will be graduating, but before you graduate.

PCsW0gbPaa	If it's an option, mail it in on paper instead of sending in an email.  People are less likely to read an attachment in an email, and more likely to read something that comes in on nice solid paper.    Make sure the format is nice and easy to read.  That means ONE well-organized page and plenty of white space.    Have an "Objective:" at the top that is short, to the point, inspired, and on-target for the job to which you are applying.  This means you probably have to customize your resume for every application.    Call ONCE the week after you send in your resume.  Ask to speak to the hiring manager or HR person.  If you can, introduce yourself on the phone, tell them you sent in your resume, and ask them to review it.  Tell them that you think you would be a good fit for the job and are hoping to be able to come in for an interview to discuss it further.  Say you hope that they will take the time to notice your resume even though they probably have a large number of applicants.  Then leave him/her your name and number and say thank you.  DO NOT call again unless they call you first.  Being a pain in the **** is no way to get hired.  If you can't get the HR or hiring manager, be polite and give the same pitch to the receptionist... they might help you out.

8zFHBM0Paa	Hi,    The area of call centre efficiency is a complicated one, and often the wrong things get measured. So a call centre is measured by how quickly the phone gets answered rather than how satisfied the customer is with the service, and most importantly whether their query got answered in the first call or whether they had to call back.  If you can reduce the number of call backs your customers are happy and your call traffic drops which means you can be more effective with those customers.    Your idea of joining up departments is a great one - we've just done some research on what customers hate about call centres - http://www.intelligentdialogue.com/call-... where you can download the results from the reserach. It shows just how important departments working together is to customers.     Good luck with your suggestion. The key to improving service is to see it from the customers point of view.|`|75NM6Zhtaa	Having worked in a call centre,perhaps treating people like human beings and not automated answering machines would be a start.Respect would help,doing away with ridiculous permitted call times to resolve a customers problem would help.

For the other car, multiply the MO sales tax rate by the price of the car (not including tax).  See whether it is more or less than the sales tax that you made for that car.

Walmart must be hiring now, since everyone now is shopping there instead of more expensive stores. Same goes for any discount stores, fast food places, etc... People now are preferring to go to Mickey Ds, KFC, Burger King, than spend $30-60 at sit down/waitress service restaurants. Also, try Supermarkets, with people being laid off, they stay at home and cook more of their meals too, meaning they go to Supermarkets to get what they need. They'll need cahiers.

ZwrkKMsKaa	Hi Angelica.    I'm Mike, and I work for TurboTax.    Yes, go ahead and file a 2008 tax return. Just like Cat said, be sure to select "Someone else can claim me as a dependent."    Sounds like your taxes should be pretty straight forward. If you want to give it a shot, plug a few numbers into the free edition of TurboTax. You can save your info and run it by your mom before you file.    http://turbotax.intuit.com/    Hope this helps!    Mike M, TurboTax writer/editor|`|MmTe8W8uaa	You are required to file for 2007.  For 2008, you are definitely allowed to file, and may be required to file for both years.  If you are not sure, then file for both years.  There is no possibility of getting into trouble with the IRS for filing.  However, you can in trouble for filing something that is inaccurate or for not filing.    If you file, whether because you are required to file or because you want to get back money that was withheld, then you must check the box that indicates that you are a person whom another person (your mom) can claim as a dependent.  If you fail to check this box, then you can get in trouble for not checking it (and thereby falsely claiming that she cannot claim you).|`|d9f5eef57376876109b9a113a7c9af2eaa	Yes, you file a tax return.  She didn't mean that she'd get in trouble if you filed a return - only that there would be questions if you also claimed yourself.    But you'll still need to file a return.  If only to get back any withholding that exceeded your tax liability.    File a return, check the box that says "someone else can claim me as a dependent", and go from there.    And yes, you can go ahead and file 2007 as well.  You have three years from the original due date of a return to get a refund.  So you've still got a couple years' to file the 2007.  But if you're getting a refund - why wait?

There are other things beyond burial expenses that you need to watch out for such as estate taxes, credit obligations etc that most people think disappear when they pass on but instead are passed on themselves to other family members.

Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.    2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.    3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.    4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.    5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.    6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor. A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a particular real estate listing. The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.    7. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.    Good luck!|`|36c14b851c1b13bc28cf6afed203fa32aa	How old are you.

You need to be 17 or older or have your parents consent in order to get paid. It's really easy and you can earn some good cash from it. Hope it helped.
a2Bpe3inaa	If you need additional clarification OK to email me  Hope this helps you    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash_flow_s...
km9cQNAXaa	You need to contact your mortgage company and ask them when the balance on your account is calculated. if it's done on a daily basis it doesn't matter when you make the payment but if it's only calculated once a month you should try to make the payment the day before the calculation is made. That way you get maximum benefit and keep the interest the cash was earning for yourself.    Ian M|`|WwXrTQgaaa	The sooner the better. If you can pay it all at the first of the month, that's better. If you only have half, pay it when you get it and pay the other half when you get it.    Easy to remember: the sooner the better.    You MUST make sure they allocate your money correctly though. Don't just send it in without specific instructions and if they have any special procedures for this, make sure you follow them. Some banks don't allow this or require you to pay a fee to do it (it usually comes out better anyway). Otherwise you may not be avoiding the interest completely.|`|AA11404742	Paying 2 or even 4 times a week will pay it off sooner.  The reason is that you will only pay interest on the money you used for the remaining part of the month.    Say you make $500 payments twice a month, instead of $1000 once a month.  The principal you pay on the 15th will not be subject to interest for the 2nd half of that month.  Depending on how much you owe and your interest rate, you may only save a few dollars.  But you're saving that few dollars every month, and over time it can add up.  You can shave years off a mortgage this way.    But be reasonable about doing this.  I've seen people who scrimp and save and shave corners to do this, but short themselves on food, heat in the winter, and medical care.  That's penny wise, but pound foolish, I think.      Also - if your mortgage is say 6%, but your credit cards are costing you 15%, guess which is a better place to spend this extra money?|`|yHl7RIuOaa	Yes $250 every week would have most impact. $500 bi weekly next and so on.  Make sure they understand this is additional principal payment up and above your normal scheduled payment. You sure do not want them calling this prepaid interest.
ReQyHq4Baa	Fun things to do with your time that include not spending much money are:    Check the Bulletins at your library, there are always free workshops, lectures, book clubs, etc.  Take out a DVD or a book while your at it.    Read your community paper, I bet you can find free or low-cost fun events in there.    Over the summer there are always free festivals going on, pack a lunch, though, some of those food vendors, charge your soul.  Or if you want something, just get fries or a pretzel, non-meat items tend to be cheaper, than hot dogs, pepperoni pizza and such.    When the spring comes, go to the park and see, really see the birds, foxes, ducks, geese.  Look up different birds in your area on the internet.  Birdwatching is free!    Go to a restaurant and only order an appetizer and water.  It's cheaper than an entree and a drink.    Collect change and don't put your hand back in the till.  Once I collected $250 worth, bought something I wanted and put the rest in my savings.  But that means paying cash for purchases and using your debit or credit card less.    Get Jiffy Pop popcorn it's the cheapest snack available and watch a movie at home.    Give a loved one a massage or have them give one to you.    Get a basic manicure with no fake nails.  It's only $10.    Hope this is what you wanted.  I'm living on a small income and these are the kinds of things I do.|`|L9MDzufnaa	I was unemployed, broke, and very hungry several years ago.

I believe we use the UPS to actually deliver items there.<br>  <br>  Actually unless postage has not been paid, for which the recipient will be charged extra admin charges, Royal Mail do not operate a CoD even in the UK.<br>  <br>  This page might be useful to show what is available for International Items from the UK.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.royalmail.com/portal/rm/print?catId=400035&mediaId=22700576#13300245" rel="nofollow">http://www.royalmail.com/portal/rm/print...</a>|`|dE8hDmwTaa	royal mail...or royal fail as we call them have lost 4 separate parcels containing expensive items from family from the netherlands to the uk both to and from over the past 7 months for us.

4Ej32YBfaa	I am a Postman - Normally recorded and ordinary parcels are treated just the same, only that with the recorded the postie should get a signature on delivery.  The usual delivery time for Royal Mail parcels is 1 - 5 days.  <br>  <br>  To answer your question it would depend on the size of both parcels, small ones are usually delivered by your regular walking postie and large ones by drivers in vans.  So yes there is a good chance you will get a separate delivery at some point over the next few days.<br>  <br>  Also with the volume of mail sent through the Royal Mail system (80,000,000 separate items per day) it is possible that the 2 items have not been sorted onto the same delivery schedule and you may get 2 vans turning up at different times to deliver each parcel.|`|Ok4lJYVYaa	It depends where the not recorded one is coming from and whether it's first class|`|ntYPJLfuaa	it should come at the same time<br>  unless one was like first class, and the other was second class stamps

d5eab71a1ed6d6a0458e2a23f6f71d37aa	You're not stuck in lil girl fantasies, but the music business is about more than just being a great musician. You have to have excellent business skills to survive. Since you are thinking about getting emancipated, I'm assuming that your family isn't very supportive about you being a musician. That is not good. You definitely need to find people who are supportive and can help you get where you want to be in your career. I think you should spend the next two years finishing up high school, saving up money, talking to local musicians, and researching the music business. If you do this and don't become successful in the music field, at least you can go to college and study music there.|`|7tpAq9eWaa	To be honest, I would first finish High School and graduate. You don't wanna be a high school drop out. And it isn't exactly a lil girl fantasy, because some people do make it, but you should have a back up if you dont, and its harder to et into high school again than it is to start university when you're a bit older. Just have a serious talk with your parents and also consider home schooling if you drop out now for if you don't make it, or during some holiday, see an agent and ask them if you think you can make it. Basically don't rush into it without having a plan b, because most of the time it doesn't quite work out, or you could be a one hit wonder but end up not being able to live off it for the rest of your life. Good luck!!
GEWeeF6Gaa	textile cloth painting|`|TCctLAPCaa	Any jobs that pay in TIPS will be great! You can make a lot of money as a server, cocktail server, bartender, club hostess ( check people's id and charge cover) or maybe retail. You can make good money with commission if you are a good sale person. I worked at a club as a hostess for 3 years while attending college. I worked friday and saturday nights and made $250 a night on most nights. All I did was sit at the lobby and check people's ID and charge cover...and they would TIP me in my little TIP jar. Good luck! |`|7tpAq9eWaa	Well what they have here in Switzerland as "Lehre", I bet there's a word for it in English. Basically, you have a job and learn to do it at the same time, and they're jobs in which it is easiest to learn it while actually practising it (e.g. working in a bakery or otherwise in a kitchen - not fast food place - or whats it called, the person who makes stuff out of wood, or blacksmith) and it doesn't help if you have a bachelor in anything because its very ... well sorta physical. sorry i suck at explaining. I don't know if they offer just weekend jobs, but I'm sure a lot of bakeries (for example) would appreciate it a lot because many people can do anything but the weekend (they need it to relax). Being a mom I'm guessing you can cook, so that might help? Good luck!!

OR, and this is the best thing...wait until you clean up your credit to apply. That shows the lender that you were mature enough to take the time to make certain you got it right.

And I know we won't be doing any gift cards this season in our family.  Anything is really possible with these retailers especially if they have a very bad Christmas Season.  They have spent so much money putting stores everywhere, that hasn't helped them either.  We have 3 best buys within a few miles of each other.  That is just crazy!<br>  <br>  Remember Circuit City, Linen's and Things, etc.  They have recently filed usually there is no warning, last year I got stuck with a Sharper Image gift card and it had only been bought a short time before.

Keep your monthly payments the same as your current rental amount.

I would think you can take away the internet if you want since it was not part of the lease.|`|49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	Has she moved out or hasn't she?<br>  <br>  But, regardless, it was never part of your lease agreement, you have no obligation to put it back.|`|RjUhISEIaa	Not in the lease normally would mean no access to it. However, a case could be made by her that you allowed her to access it. But if she's moving out who cares...keep the ungrateful and undeserving one off it. <br>  <br>  Course you may want to get the rent money owed first... : )
