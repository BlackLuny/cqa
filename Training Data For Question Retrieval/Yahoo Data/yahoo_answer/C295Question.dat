20060806161731AAaYpdZ	Entertainment & Music;Music	What are the real roots of reggaeton?	I heard that reggae was started in latin america  when jamaicans went to panama to help build the canal. The panama community loved the music so much that they made recordings in spanish with jamaican roots reggae instrumentals. Then somehow Peurto Rico got invovled in the music. I don't know. All i can say is is that i love jamaican reggae and dancehall. That music is the bomb like for real. Anytime i listen to Bob Marley I always have to stop what i'm doin and just jam to the music. Reggaeton, well I don't know the real roots of it. When I find out then I'll proabaly be able to make my decision.
20060816200202AA2fkYu	Entertainment & Music;Music	Latinos, do you think that reggaeton can be dissussed without talking about the jamaican reggae culture ?	I don't think so. Especially since the beat is based off a jamaican song Dem Bow by shabba ranks, Also there are many riddims that are heard in  dancehall that can be found in reggaeton directly. Also it was jamaican culture that created hip hop as well. It's impossible to not talk about reggae/dancehall when talking about reggaeton. Hell you could consider reggaeton jamaican music as well as latin music. Too many jamaican elements. Especilly in Panama's reggaeton or spanish reggae or whatever you want to call it. Just to throw it in I love jamaican music and Bob Marley is the best. So is Peter Tosh and Sean Paul. I also love Damian Marley. No one can touch them.

20060729130116AANUHcL	Entertainment & Music;Music	Latinos, how do you feel about jamaicans hating on reggaeton?	I don't think that they are really hatin on the music I think that they are mad that everyone feels like its latino power alone and that jamaicans had nothing to do with our sucess. We have our festivals with reggaeton and we show our countries flags  but there aren't any jamaican flags. I think that is a problem and i'm a latino myself. Most of the credict does belong to the jamaicans because they are the ones who introduced us to the reggae sound. Jamaicans went to Panama to work on the canal and brought reggae with them. It WAS THEN that we started producing our own reggae taken from jamaican roots reggae. I just think that we owe it to them to tell em thanks that's all. I mean if jamaicans were to do the same with lets say salsa we would want credict to right?
20061228100941AAHz2Wh	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Why is there so much beef between the South and the rest of the hip hop world, New York especially?	I mean lets face it, the south is holdin **** down and I love the south even though I'm from Maryland. The music is great( even though it can get a little out of hand sometimes with the topics they speak on) but I still rock southern music. I've been to Atlanta and Miami and I love those cities a lot. Its nothin but love down there. But I've been to New York too and I love NYC alot. No place like it. The birth place of hip hop, still the music and enteratinment capital of the US and the world. That is somthing I feel will never change no matter how big other regions get. I think its a respect factor. Since I know about the NYC, South issue more , I will talk about that. New York is the birth place of hip hop period. They have dictated everything that hip hop consists of. From the music, to the jewlery and all of those things. Aint nobody was doin before New York that's just the truth, hate it or love it.

20090203124545AAijN5j	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Why is it every time I tell my parents something positive I am doing/ about myself they object?	I am 32 yrs old and I know what is best for me. Why is it every time I tell my parents something, (EX) I am going back to school, I want to be a Sunday School teacher to when it comes to me buying myself something nice they have to object to it.?     As in you don't need to go back to school. You need to stay on disability "due to back problems" Yet the Dr. says I can go back to work. Or better yet I tell them I want to teach Sunday School to teens yet my parents object. "saying that is not a wise idea." Why is that?    The point is I respect them and I don't tell them what to do, not to do yet they want to stick their noses in my business and object whatever I do. Why would that be?    I am a parent myself and I know if my 32 yr old daughter wanted to better her career, life in general  or help others I would stand behind her 100% of the way.    Note: My parents are old fashion Christians.

20090203130903AAVgdqW	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	For better or for worse?	Just a moment to reflect on someone who has changed your life for better or for worse?      I have both for better:  My step-dad, he took on 3 kids that weren't biologically his and one on the way he didn't leave like the previous men who left my mom with offspring. (They got divorced) I talk to him more than I do my own mother.      For worse:  Kind of sad but in a way it helped me-My first born was born prematurely and passed away in my arms 34 days after he was born, I am now a proud mother of an almost 3 yr old beautiful boy(taught me to appreciate being a mom) I value him so much.  In a way it's worse cause death is never better.

20090203131332AAYHRxK	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Do you think that there is an age limit to writing in a diary?	I'm 17 and have kept a diary ever since I could write. I've always been a writer and I need to keep a journal of my thoughts. When people find out that I have a so called diary, they think it's filled with "I heart Kevin" all over it. but it's not like that. I write down what happened during the day, what's bothering me. And just creative writing that I do. It's not all rainbows and butterflies. It's a serious way to express myself.    So do you have a diary or journal? And how old are you?   I think everyone should write. It's great. There shouldn't be an age limit. 13 year old girls aren't the only ones with stuff on their minds.

20090203133502AARKzvg	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Will I hurt a Scorpio guy friend if...?	Me and one Scorpio guy are being friends since long time but because I always liked him even more than just a friend we started to be weird to each other and we ended up sometimes ignoring each other and probably hurting each other somehow with a cold behavior. So I felt desperate and I've met one Aquarius guy, who I am not interested at all into, we are just friends but he asked me out again and I will go out with him. The problem is that the place where we would go, we can't change that is a place where a lot of people who know the Scorpio guy would be and might eventually tell him, I have been with a guy there. As I said we are all only friends, I haven't done anything with anyone just chatting but the Scorpio guy was often jealous before of some stupid things. Do you think he would become bad to me or stuff for that? Am I not really being ethical with the Aquarius guy or the Scorpio guy? I do not want to hurt anyone.

20060805210844AAv2CSP	Entertainment & Music;Music	Is it really fair for latinos to say that they are reclaming their place in hip hop?	I'm just sayin that before the latinos got on the band wagon, the jamaican community was doin hip hop in their island. Read it up on www.wikipedia.com. People say that without latinos hip hop would not be where it is today. I mean if reggae got big, if dancehall got big( which both paved the way for reggaeton to blow up right now), who can say that with time hip hop would not have gotten big. I think that the ones over looked here are jamaicans, not latinos. Even american blacks over look jamaica's musical contribution. I'm just sayin that before anyone talks about how they aint gettin no credict for hip hop, we should look back to the roots of the music. I aint bein racist i'm just bein for real.

I advise you not to think of actually consuming any of these things or think of others consuming it.             1. Supposing that the myth is reality, does eating a vampire constitute as cannibalism?       2. Supposing that the myth is reality, does eating a werewolf constitute as cannibalism?       3. If the previous answer is "yes" is it still cannibalism if the werewolf is transformed?      4. If the answer to number two is "no" is it cannibalism if the werewolf is yet to transform into a wolf?      5. Supposing that the myth is reality, does eating a centaur constitute as cannibalism?       6. If the previous answer is "yes" is it still cannibalism if you only eat the horse half?      7. If the answer to number five is "no" is it cannibalism if you find only the top half and eat that?      8. Supposing that the myth is reality, does eating a Minotaur constitute as cannibalism?       9.  If the previous answer is "yes" is it still cannibalism if you only eat the bull half?      10. If the answer to number eight is "no" is it cannibalism if you find only the bottom half and eat that?      11. Supposing that the myth is reality, does eating a mermaid/man/half-human-half-sea-creature constitute as cannibalism?       12. If the previous answer is "yes" is it still cannibalism if you only eat the fish/sea creature half?      13. If the answer to number eleven is "no" is it cannibalism if you find only the human half?      14. Is eating a topical disease (ie, ringworm, gangrene, various fungi) off a person, does it constitute as cannibalism?       15. Does taking communion constitute as cannibalism? (It is the body of Christ as bread.)      16. If your friend turned into a foodstuff that is in the norm to consume (ie, a sandwich, a candy bar, cereal, ect) would that constitute as cannibalism?       17. Would eating scabs, or drinking [human] blood (assuming you, too, are human) constitute as cannibalism?        18. Would eating a zombie constitute as cannibalism?       19. If someone was forcing another to eat human flesh by gunpoint, would the person who ate the flesh be considered a cannibal, or would the person doing the forcing just be considered sick?      20. In your own words, please define cannibalism.                  Thank you.

When I think of a clown I think of a greasy, stubbled face with over-dramatic makeup staring down at me with a grim smile.   I just have a natural fear of clowns and this story helps out.   There was a summer fair, and they hired a clown. The clown had an over-dramatic outfit and over-dramatic makeup with big red freckles and yellow braids. She was creepy because she kinda just popped up behind you and gave you a sticker called a 'Clown Kiss'. My cousins and I were hiding behind a tree in fear. I remember myself instructing "I'm going to have to keep an eye on that clowns whereabouts, or else I won't feel safe".I remember diving into that car and slamming the door. I also remember watching shreiking kids running from the 'mock-happy' clown. Thats why I want there to be NO CLOWNS IN PUBLIC!!!

20060924105125AA9BNdU	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	The nice neighbor?	Sam had been in the hectic newspaper business for twenty-five years when he decided that he was sick of the stress and quit his job. He bought 50 acres of land in the middle of Nowhere, Vermont. His place was so isolated that the postman came only once a week and he went to the grocery store only once a month.      After six months of near total isolation, he hears a knock on the door. He opens the door and a big bearded Vermonter is standing there. He says, "Names Enoch...your neighbor from four miles over the ridge. Having a party Saturday...thought you'd like to come."      "Great," replies Sam. "After six months of living like this I'm ready to meet some local folks. Thanks for inviting me."      As Enoch is leaving, he stops. "Gotta warn you, though, there's gonna be some drinkin'." "Not a problem. After 25 years in the newspaper business, I can drink with the best of them."      Again, as he starts to leave, Enoch stops. "More 'n likely gonna be some fightin', too." Tough crowd, Sam thinks to himself. "Well, I get along with people. Don't worry, I'll be there. Thanks again."      Once again, Enoch turns from the door, "I've seen some wild sex at these parties, too." "Now that is not a problem," Sam says. "I've been up here all alone for six long months. I'll definitely be there.      By the way, what should I wear?"      Enoch stops in the doorway one last time and says... "Whatever you want. Just gonna be the 2 of us there."

There was this girl around 14 or 15, who had this Yoo-hoo bottle, and she kept drinking out of it, and putting the cap back on and shaking it up. So I was sitting beside her at the table we were eating at. (She's my sister's friends daughter, or something stupid like that.) And the bottle burst open, and Yoo-hoo was all over my suit, my tie, and even my shoes.       I really, really, really, had to restrain myself that day.

20090224175624AA1UgKL	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Do you know this song?	All I can remember from it is 'la la la la, la la la, la la la la la la la,' and there are probably more la's but  I just want to know if you might know it. It kind of has a "Fiest- 1 2 3 4' vibe to  it. I heard it in Hollister so don't think screamo or anything like that. It was probably pop music. I think a guy sung it. Maybe during some parts it sounded like a crowd was singing. I heard it in '08 December I'm pretty sure so I don't think its that old. I tried the Hollsiter website and nothing.      If you don't know the song, don't try to answer, but if you have any guesses feel free.

See the T-H at the end like   thank you for saying it wrong again   what do I gotta do to get some respect 'round here   start frontin' like I'm crazy and throwin' round chairs   would you quit tellin' people that I'm from Brown Deer   really man, what you tryin' to do, kill my career?   It's bad enough they didn't put my name on the roster   now they're trying to claim that I'm a J.C. Chavez imposter   What? Where's my manager? Wait that's me   at times like these I wish I had a fake i.d.   so I tell the bouncer, "Hey, where's the bathroom?   It's an emergency dude I'll be back soon."   Sneak to the stage, hand my CD to the D.J.   tell him when I cue him hit play, ready?      chorus:      bridge:   Hey D.J. please won't you give me a chance so I can drop this beat and make these people dance. Now um, one thing is clear they goin' like what they hear so um, lend me your ear and just watch me get my groove on      verse 3:   You know you're broke when you sing for free   thinkin' that you'll make some money if you bring CD's   show up, the sound system is soundin' like garbage   my man where'd you buy this microphone from, Target?   It's funny how the same people that mean mug you   will come up to you after the show and try to hug you   now matter how tight you are on the mic   there's always one hater that's like, "Dude he's alright, I'm better though."   It's sort of sad but I had to laugh   when I thought this girl wanted my autograph   I said, "Hey how you doin' what's your name?" "It's Margie,   sorry to bother you but can I borrow that Sharpie?"   "What? Don't you know who I am girl?"   "No. Wait, are you that dude from 'That 70's Show?'"

20061014194711AANJrYJ	Entertainment & Music;Music	Do people think that Atlanta can really beat New York in a NYC vs Atl fued when it comes to hip hop?	As much as Atlanta might be sellin and makin hits, New York would definetly beat the holy crap out of At. No disrespect, but the only reason why Atlanta and the south in general is in the spotlight is because New York has been blinded by their own ego. But they deserve to have an ego cuz, hell they gave birth to all of this ****. The day that New York gets themselves together and start makin hits again, The south will not even be known. To be honest no one in the south really impresses me any way. Just people like TI, Ludacris, UGK, Outkast and Young Jeezy. New York got, Busta Rhymes, Nas, Jay Z, Diddy, Biggie Smallz ( RIP ), Rakim, Mase ( even though he moved to the A) and 50 Cent. Of course can't forget Ghostface,  Jim Jones( Ballin ) Juelz Santana, The Fugees, Afrika Bambatta and Kool Herc. New York stand up.

I support all my brothas and sistas no matter were you from. New York is still the mother city of hip hop and that will never change and people need to remember that. I see where New York is coming from. People forget about the prices that New Yrok had to pay in order to get hip hop in the spotlight. They are the the first people to have brought hip hop to the forefront of this country and that is somthin that the south, west and midwest needs to remember. It just don't look that way anymore and that is why New York is upset. As long as we remember where this music came from, We should have no problem. New York belive or not wants Atlanta to shine, We want, Chi town to shine, West Coast everywhere. Whenever ya'll come to our city to promote your material we support ya'll, we cheer for ya'll. We love ya'll, its just the respect and acknowlegdement factor.
20060822160724AAFeB4o	Entertainment & Music;Music	Latinos, how would you feel reggaeton is embraced in the jamaican community?	I'm askin cuz reggaeton's start was inspired by the roots reggae of jamaica. Hip hop was made by jamaicans in the first place and there are a lot of riddims in reggaeton that were used in dancehall first. This is to clear up why some people would think that the jamaican community did nothing to help reggaeton music in general. But I was just wondering if anyone really cared . I care and i'm latino. I realize where our music comes from. It's a shame that more latinos don't know.

20070117184702AAHEbbr	Entertainment & Music;Music	What do people think Hip Hop is Dead really means?	I support Nas in his campaign of hip hop is dead. People don't take the time to think no more. This is proven with peoples response to the hip hop is dead phrase. You got Luda with one of the most pitiful and stupid shirts that I have ever seen sayin that " hip hop aint dead, it lives in the south" That alone proves why hip hop is dead. Now the south thinks that they are hip hop culture all by themselves. They think so much of themselves to put a t shirt out like that. I aint sayin don't be proud of the success, but at the same time don't spit in the face of all the people who broke they backs for hip hop culture by havin a shirt that says that. You got Jeezy gettin into beef with one of the greatest lyricists of all time in Nas. Talkin bout nas don't have the right to say hip hp is dead. Hell!,What gives Jeezy or anybosy the right to say its not. Just cuz they got platinum albums and they city or region is hot. That don't mean that hip hop is alive.

She hopes we can be friends.   I think, yeah, I guess we can say I.   But didn't think to ask her why.   She blocked her eyes and drew the curtains,   with knots I've got yet to untie.      REFRAIN:   What if I were Romeo in black jeans?   What if I was Heathcliff, it's no myth?   Maybe she's just looking for,   someone to dance with.      See, it was just too soon to tell.   Snd looking for some parallel.   Can be an endless game.   We said goodbye before hello.   My secrets she will never know.   And if I dig a hole to China,   I'll catch the first junk to Soho.      REPEAT REFRAIN      Sometime from now you'll bow to pressure,   some things in life you cannot measure by degrees.   I'm between the poles and the equator,   don't send no private investigator to find me please.   'Less he speaks Chinese,   and can dance like Astaire overseas.   OK?      REPEAT REFRAIN

20070904195429AAJMhkm	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	How do you set up a new guitar when you buy it? Plz help......?	I'm looking to buy a Fender Standard Stratocaster, and I really don't wanna mess up. I have an Ibanez Gio electric and it's really my first time buying a guitar (although I've been playing for a while) I haven't picked a certain one yet, I'm gonna go to the store and feel around, to see which neck I like and all that. I think the only thing I'm gonna change on the one I get is, putting 10 guage strings on it. Now, I'm gonna get a new, non-usued guitar, and everyone is saying stuff like, you have to get it set up. Now, I'm not sure what that means. But like, most of the time you go play one at the store, the strings seem farther away from the fret board, is this part of why you have to get it set up or what? What do you say to the people at the store to make them understand what you mean by having it set up? I just wanna get 10 gauge strings on it, so would I even really need to get it set up? If so what would I say, how long would that take, or would it cost extra? I'm sorta lost......

The questions I'm asking are pretty simple and require little thinking, so I'm expecting more answers from you, R&P!         Survey:   1. How many artists (what I mean by 'artists' are bands and singers, btw) do you have on your iPod/iTunes/mp3 player?   2. How many songs?   3. Albums? (they don't have to be full albums, btw)   4. Genres?   5. Playlists?   6. Do you think you listen to a wide range of rock bands? Provide an example. (Here's mine: I listen to everything from Nirvana to Nightwish to Radiohead to Green Day to Deep Purple to Creedence Clearwater Revival to Megadeth)   7. All-Time Favorite Band   8. All-Time Favorite Musician   9. All-Time Favorite Song   10. All-Time Favorite Album      BQ: I asked this question yesterday:    What are some bands/singers popular with the general public but not on R&P?      I must've not explained my question in detail enough for people to understand, so I'll explain it again so that I'll get the answers that I'm looking for this time, lol.      What I mean by that is basically underrated bands (or singers) in R&P, but popular with the general public. Not post-grunge, pop-punk, or Disney bands, I'm talking about REAL rock bands lol. And what I mean by 'not popular' is underrated.   Examples: AC/DC, Van Halen, Bruce Springsteen, The Eagles, etc. Can you name some more?

You Attract an Aquarius   When wacky, eccentric, independent Aquarius meet you, they've met their match.   You're just as unique and outspoken as any Aquarius, and as a result, they feel instantly connected to you.      And while you know you and your Aquarius are meant to be, you always allow for space in your relationship.   The last thing your Aquarius wants is to feel fenced in. You know that in this case, absence really does make the heart grow fonder.       cool, never dated an Aquarius that acted like one though.

20090203141420AA43Tvx	Entertainment & Music;Television;Drama	All my Law & Order SVU fans.....?	Well. I am hugely obsessed with law & order svu, and i am so pumped for the new episode tonight : )  But I was wondering, has anyone else noticed how Elliot, rather than Olivia, is nearly always the one to be physically injured? I can remember Elliot being shot in multiple episodes, blown backward and concussed by dynamite, thrown through a window, kidnapped and held hostage, and temporarily blinded... But olivia is almost never injured. The episodes where she was hurt (that i can remember) were "Fault" where she was cut on the neck, "Undercover" in sealview prison, and that one where she was hospitalized for a short time after inhaling poisonous gas. Are there any that I'm missing?? It just seems like Elliot's always the one in the hospital...Not that I'm complaining. I guess the writers just feel like it would be harder to watch Benson get injured rather than Stabler...Although I wonder what would happen if Olivia was seriously injured? How would Elliot react? I guess we'll find out when (if) she ever opens up and tells him about what happened at Sealview prison ("Undercover.")

20090224193033AAaES8K	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Venom - Not Black Metal!??!?	It seems a lot of people discredit Venom for creating black metal as a sub-genre of heavy metal, usually stating "they only coined the term" etc.       Now, Venom obviously created a new sub-genre because nobody sounded like that before them, nobody did what they did. After the first album, they decided to call their music "black metal" and wrote a song using that same name. They then named their album "Black Metal" as well... They were THE first band to call their sound "black metal" - every other "black metal" band, be it Bathory, Emperor, Darkthrone, Mayhem, etc. came after them. So how are Venom not black metal? It makes no sense and it drives me insane. Even then, a band like Marduk or Blood Storm - they claim Venom as a main influence and basically use some of the same ideas and sounds - stage names, treble-y guitars, incredibly fast tempos, a lack of palm-muting where thrash/death bands would usually place it within a riff, lyrics and imagery dealing with the occult, distorted vocals - all the same ingredients! Also, Venom shows were rare back then, much like black metal bands today who rarely perform live. Venom are BLACK METAL GODS!
20090224193215AANYyuq	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Venom - Not Black Metal!??!?	It seems a lot of people discredit Venom for creating black metal as a sub-genre of heavy metal, usually stating "they only coined the term" etc.      Now, Venom obviously created a new sub-genre because nobody sounded like that before them, nobody did what they did. After the first album, they decided to call their music "black metal" and wrote a song using that same name. They then named their album "Black Metal" as well... They were THE first band to call their sound "black metal" - every other "black metal" band, be it Bathory, Emperor, Darkthrone, Mayhem, etc. came after them. So how are Venom not black metal? It makes no sense and it drives me insane. Even then, a band like Marduk or Blood Storm - they claim Venom as a main influence and basically use some of the same ideas and sounds - stage names, treble-y guitars, incredibly fast tempos, a lack of palm-muting where thrash/death bands would usually place it within a riff, lyrics and imagery dealing with the occult, distorted vocals - all the same ingredients!

20090203140935AAXkrNl	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	*~RIDDLE!!!!!!!!!!~*?	A blonde guy gets home early from work and hears strange noises coming from the bedroom. He rushes upstairs to find his wife naked on the bed,sweating and panting. "What's up?" he says. "I'm having a heart attack," cries the woman.      He rushes downstairs to grab the phone, but just as he's dialing, his 4-year-old son comes up and says,"Daddy! Daddy! Uncle Ted's hiding in your closet and he's got no clothes on!"      The guy slams the phone down and storms upstairs into the bedroom, past his screaming wife, and rips open the wardrobe door.      Sure enough, there is his brother, totally naked, cowering on the closetfloor.      You rotten bastard, "says the husband,"my wife's having a heart attack and you're running around naked scaring the kids!!!      2) A wife and her blonde husband were trying to sleep, but the next door neighbor's dog was barking. This had been going on for months. Every night, the dog barked for hours, robbing them of sleep.      Finally, the blonde says, "I've had enough. I'm going to do something about this." So he gets up, puts on his robe and goes down stairs and out the back door. A little while later, he comes back.      "What did you do? The dog's still barking," asks the wife.      "I put the dog in our back yard. Let's see how they like it."

But when Beth is captured and forced to serve the kamikaze organization, Its up to Kiro, and his ragtag group of friends to stop her or kill her. If they fail, the 500 year old shapeshifting kistsune, Beth, will stop at nothing to destroy all of japan.

Or do you think that simply because they are not japanese they must call it an oel manga.       My personal opinion is that if you don't accept an american artists work as a manga if he wants it to be so you are a rascist. Because thats the same as saying a white man can't be a rapper because he's not black. It also seems that people think that just because a japanese artist makes it, that its suddenly better than ANYTHING an american artist can do.

She is beginning to worry that people forget about her now that she is away getting help - and she is getting even lower and down about everything. She is my best friend, and it is me she turns to for talking and cheering up. She likes daft little texts and sayings to make her smile.. girlie and dirty things.... basically something to make her laugh and remind her we are all thinking of her always and really miss her.  So the question is do you know any sayings/texts/emails that are funny, daft, dirty, stupid, friend anything like that 'cos I have run out of the ones I knew off.... the only catch is that they must not be ''teary/emotional'' ones.... for example not ones that are going to make her be lilke awww I miss everyone, I want home or something....

She has talked about how lonely it gets on tour.  I'm sure there are plenty of temptations.        She is open about wanting to have a family.  She talks about reconstituted or born-again virginity.  Does that reveal something she isn't telling us?      And she has been linked to at least a couple of guys whose reputations are, shall we say, less than perfectly savory.

Got along great(all same interests and tastes), great chemistry( i am a leo).She was all over me all the time gigling laughing etc Knew her for like 5 months (flirted all the time she kept popping up and dropping of the map etc..). Went out a few time never more then making out. ..turns out she had a dude she was seeing who she said was a tool. I was not cool with that told her if she wanted to hang out she should break up. She said she was and then did, asked me out with her friends ( you aquas and your friends groups she was huge on me meeting all her friends and telling them about me;)        Anywho again nothing more then making out. She left with her friends....and dropped off the map for a few;) being a leo...left a voice mail i was like whats up lets hang out i am crazy about you, think you're gorgeous etc.. let hang. She responded she was in class and would call me afterward. and nothing;)         I shot her a msg via txt basically whats up I dont like this off and on let me know what going on. yea or nay. annnnd nothing. I assumed she heard the msg and freaked;)       So i figured whatever she ran into me in the mall after a month and stopped and as chatting like normal I asked her what happened. She said it was mess and her semi ex bf and me etc..she turned down moving in with him etc. and she was just focusing on work to avoid it all and that me coming on so strong was the wrong move and she just likes to disappear and run away because emotions are a no ( apparently an aqua thing). I was confidant and chilled out and said i would drop her a line sometime etc..        I think i flipped her out coming on like a Leo and she wanted something light, to move from the old dude and just see what happened. regardless Aqua women how would I handle this with you after unintentionally messing up( i am a leo and the emotion thing is natural and most chicks are cool with it nvr been with aqua) saveable or no?        Thanks

20090225004347AA5y6ro	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	How Should I Set Up my Gig for a Rock Band?	The Band:     I'm going to be doing a live performance with my band which is heavy/classic rock.  It has two guitars (distorted usually but sometimes acoustic), a bass, a keyboard, drums (three toms, double bass, hihat, ride, two crashes, splash, cowbell, snare, and china cymbol), a lead singer and two backup vocalists which are the guitarists.        The Location:   Semi-large backyard with about 100 people attending.  (there will be plenty of leftover space)      The Current Equipment:   All instruments (including pedals and such), amps for the guitars and bass.      The Question:  What else do I need?   I want it to sound verrry proffesional so I'm assuming I should run through a P.A.  What sort of P.A should I get.  I'm guessing I also have to get speakers to run the P.A. through, what should I get as far as that goes, I like to have the bass drum and bass guitar be pretty prominent so how should I handle that.  Should I have the guitar amps mic'd and run through the P.A. even though they can get loud enough on there own, and basically run everything through the P.A. and then practice with someone to mix for us.  Also do I have to mic the amps or should I run them directly through the P.A with an external output from the amp.  Which drums should I mic, the bass drum I know, anything else or should i leave the rest alone?  I'll be using this equipment much more than once so its not worth renting.      Any advice helps, thanks, also if you know of any cheap P.A's that have enough channels for such a thing please post links.

20090225012733AApzwfK	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	How can a Taurus girl get an Aries guy?	How can a Taurus girl actually get an Aries male to chase her? The funny thing is, that evey guy that I have talked to were Aries.  I'm a Taurus. But I've never stuck around long enough to know anything about them. There's one right now that I was talking to, but I don't really know how to navigate this.
20090225014733AAEfL1D	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Does ignoring an Aries guy make him get the hint?	Like if u don't talk to him for a few days, maybe even a week or so, does he get the hint that u moved on? Is he mad at u by that point? Or is he like forget it, I'll leave her alone? I'm a Taurus and I'm asking this because I've been thru so much crap behind him and I'm tired of him now. I'm very resentful towards him now. I handle him with a very long stick, I try to keep my distance now. I haven't talked to him in 5 days since we hung out last week with his roommate and I was a real  *****, ignoring him and everything, the silent treatment, u name it! I never told him why I was upset either. I spent the night with him and didn't want to have sex. He said I ruined it cuz I wasn't into it, and I didn't care at that point, he just made me sick. I rushed out of there the next morning never to be seen or heard from again. That was truly it for me. So, yesterday I was sending fwd txt messages to ppl in my phone and he happened to be one of them, it didn't mean anything. he was the only one that texted back telling me not to send him dumb fwd messages like that.  To me, he sounded pissed off and I asked him why he sounded mad and he said he wasn't, but I just told him that I wouldn't send him anything else and to have a nice day and to take care. I just wanted to cut it off and not feed into his attitude- if he had one, idk. But I wasn't sticking around for it, he didn't respond after that and I just laughed.
20090225012821AAcqyta	Entertainment & Music;Movies	Ideas for my horror movie trailer?	Here's the storyline:       Jayne's having a birthday party. All goe well until she gos downstairs, opens the bin to reveal Emily's medication there.    Emily is 9, Jane's adopted sister. Without her pills, she becomes a physchopath.    So, when Jane sees the pills, the camera moves suddenly to Emily, standing with a menacing grin on her face.    When Jane returns to her friends in the bedroom, one of her friends walks out to use the bathroom.    Upon entering, the friend notices the "Wanna play?" written in red on the toilet paper (weird, I know).   She enters the bathroom, and "Wanna Play?" in big writing is written on the bathroom's mirror.    Before the friend gets to explain to the friends, all their phones go off, the ringtone the sound of a little girl asking if they wanted to play with her.    Jane goes downstairs again, to find drawings sprawled out on the kitchen bench, each depicting her friend's death.    It goes on... blah blah. I've got some ideas..    I need more. It needs to be 1-3 minutes!    Please, your help would be really apprepriated.    Remember, no blood. No extreme violence. It can't be too gory. Also note that Emily carries Barbie with her all the time. Anything scary to do with the doll would be awesome!    Thanks!!!

Do you think she is ignoring me? I'm aged 20 if that helps. (She is a primary school teacher, if that helps, so maybe she is busy...) I dunno???      On Sunday she did say that she is interested in getting to know me, but hasn't responded to my mail since then. What do you think?
